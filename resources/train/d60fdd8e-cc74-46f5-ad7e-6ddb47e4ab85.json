[{"section_title": "STATE OF THE CLIMATE IN 2009", "text": "ABSTRACT-M. O. Baringer, D. S. arnDt, anD M. r. JOhnSOn The year was characterized by a transition from a waning La Ni\u00f1a to a strengthening El Ni\u00f1o, which first developed in June. By December, SSTs were more than 2.0\u00b0C above average over large parts of the central and eastern equatorial Pacific. Eastward surface current anomalies, associated with the El Ni\u00f1o, were strong across the equatorial Pacific, reaching values similar to the 2002 El Ni\u00f1o during November and December 2009. The transition from La Ni\u00f1a to El Ni\u00f1o strongly influenced anomalies in many climate conditions, ranging from reduced Atlantic basin hurricane activity to large scale surface and tropospheric warmth. Global average surface and lower-troposphere temperatures during the last three decades have been progressively warmer than all earlier decades, and the 2000s (2000-09) was the warmest decade in the instrumental record. This warming has been particularly apparent in the mid-and high-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere and includes decadal records in New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Europe, and the Arctic. The stratosphere continued a long cooling trend, except in the Arctic. Atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations continued to rise, with CO 2 increasing at a rate above the 1978 to 2008 average. The global ocean CO 2 uptake flux for 2008, the most recent year for which analyzed data are available, is estimated to have been 1.23 Pg C yr -1 , which is 0.25 Pg C yr -1 smaller than the long-term average and the lowest estimated ocean uptake in the last 27 years. At the same time, the total global ocean inventory of anthropogenic carbon stored in the ocean interior as of 2008 suggests an uptake and storage of anthropogenic CO 2 at rates of 2.0 and 2.3 \u00b10.6 Pg C yr -1 for the decades of the 1990s and 2000s, respectively. Total-column ozone concentrations are still well below pre-1980 levels but have seen a recent reduction in the rate of decline while upper-stratospheric ozone showed continued signs of ongoing slow recovery in 2009. Ozone-depleting gas concentrations continued to decline although some halogens such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons are increasing globally. The 2009 Antarctic ozone hole was comparable in size to recent previous ozone holes, while still much larger than those observed before 1990. Due to large interannual variability, it is unclear yet whether the ozone hole has begun a slow recovery process. Global integrals of upper-ocean heat content for the last several years have reached values consistently higher than for all prior times in the record, demonstrating the dominant role of the oceans in the planet's energy budget. Aside from the El Ni\u00f1o development in the tropical Pacific and warming in the tropical Indian Ocean, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) transitioned to a positive phase during the fall/winter 2009. Ocean heat fluxes contributed to SST anomalies in some regions (e.g., in the North Atlantic and tropical Indian Oceans) while dampening existing SST anomalies in other regions (e.g., the tropical and extratropical Pacific). The downward trend in global chlorophyll observed since 1999 continued through 2009, with current chlorophyll stocks in the central stratified oceans now approaching record lows since 1997. Extreme warmth was experienced across large areas of South America, southern Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Australia had its second warmest year on record. India experienced its warmest year on record; Alaska had its second warmest July on record, behind 2004; and New Zealand had its warmest August since records began 155 years ago. Severe cold snaps were reported in the UK, China, and the Russian federation. Drought affected large parts of southern North America, the Caribbean, South America, and Asia. China suffered its worst drought in five decades. India had a record dry June associated with the reduced monsoon. Heavy rainfall and floods impacted Canada, the United States, the Amazonia and southern South America, many countries along the east and west coasts of Africa, and the UK. The U.S. experienced its wettest October in 115 years and Turkey received its heaviest rainfall over a 48-hr period in 80 years. Sea level variations during 2009 were strongly affected by the transition from La Ni\u00f1a to El Ni\u00f1o conditions, especially in the tropical Indo-Pacific. Globally, variations about the long-term trend also appear to have been influenced by ENSO, with a slight reduction in global mean sea level during the 2007/08 La Ni\u00f1a event and a return to the long-term trend, and perhaps slightly higher values, during the latter part of 2009 and the current El Ni\u00f1o event. Unusually low florida Current transports were observed in May and June and were linked to high sea level and coastal flooding along the east coast of the United States in the summer. Sea level significantly decreased along the Siberian coast through a combination of wind, ocean circulation, and steric effects. Cloud and moisture increased in the tropical Pacific. The surface of the western equatorial Pacific freshened considerably from 2008 to 2009, at least partially owing to anomalous eastward advection of fresh surface water along the equator during this latest El Ni\u00f1o. Outside the more variable tropics, the surface salinity anomalies associated with evaporation and precipitation areas persisted, consistent with an enhanced hydrological cycle. Global tropical cyclone (TC) activity was the lowest since 2005, with six of the seven main hurricane basins (the exception is the Eastern North Pacific) experiencing near-normal or somewhat below-normal TC activity. Despite the relatively mild year for overall hurricane activity, several storms were particularly noteworthy: Typhoon Morakot was the deadliest typhoon on record to hit Taiwan; Cyclone Hamish was the most intense cyclone off Queensland since 1918; and the state of Hawaii experienced its first TC since 1992. The summer minimum ice extent in the Arctic was the third-lowest recorded since 1979. The 2008/09 boreal snow cover season marked a continuation of relatively shorter snow seasons, due primarily to an early disappearance of snow cover in spring. Preliminary data indicate a high probability that 2009 will be the 19th consecutive year that glaciers have lost mass. Below normal precipitation led the 34 widest marine terminating glaciers in Greenland to lose 101 km 2 ice area in 2009, within an annual loss rate of 106 km 2 over the past decade. Observations show a general increase in permafrost temperatures during the last several decades in Alaska, northwest Canada, Siberia, and Northern Europe. Changes in the timing of tundra green-up and senescence are also occurring, with earlier green-up in the High Arctic and a shift to a longer green season in fall in the Low Arctic. The Antarctic Peninsula continues to warm at a rate five times larger than the global mean warming. Associated with the regional warming, there was significant ice loss along the Antarctic Peninsula in the last decade. Antarctic sea ice extent was near normal to modestly above normal for the majority of 2009, with marked regional contrasts within the record. The 2008/09 Antarctic-wide austral summer snowmelt was the lowest in the 30-year history. This I. INTRODUCTION-M. O. Baringer and D. S. arndt The primary goal of the annual State of the Climate collection of articles is to document the weather and climate events in 2009 from around the world and put them into accurate historical perspective, with a particular focus on unusual or anomalous events. The year also marks the end of the first decade of the 21st century, so whenever possible the climate anomalies over this decade are highlighted. This year the State of the Climate report brings together more than 300 authors from every continent and from over 160 different research groups to collaborate, share data and insights, and describe the observed changes in climate from different perspectives. The 2009 El Ni\u00f1o and the global consequences described herein highlight the global scope of connections between weather, climate, and, one could argue, climate scientists. In keeping with the increasingly global perspective of this report, the authors and editors seek to provide an inclusive synthesis of diverse weather and climate data to describe what took place across our planet last year. For example, recognizing the importance of providing error statistics, differing analysis products and datasets are included where possible (e.g., see sidebar on ocean heat content analyses in Chapter 3). We expect this trend to continue in future reports. Notably, the document's editors represented three disciplinary backgrounds (meteorology, oceanography, and biology). This composition reflects the increasing recognition that the natural world is embedded within, impacted by, and exerts influence on the physical climate system. We expect these connections to be explored in future issues of State of the Climate. As a guiding principle behind the inclusion of certain climatic events into this report, the Global Climate Observing System has identified Essential Climate Variables (ECVs, see GCOS 2003) (see appendix for a full list of abbreviations) necessary to support the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. These variables are defined as those required for international exchange and should be economically and technically feasible to acquire (Table 1.1). The State of the Climate report has evolved to include an increasing number of these climatically important variables as data availability increases and the analysis techniques and attributions improve. The degree to which each of these ECVs can be assessed and reported depends largely on the level of data availability both currently and as a homogeneous historical record and, hence, can be divided into cat-egories: (1) being monitored, (2) partially monitored, and (3) not yet monitored. To be listed as monitored, the ECV not only must be observed across much of the world, but also needs a moderately long-term dataset with accompanying analysis. Also the dataset needs to be updated in near-real time and have a peerreviewed article documenting the reliability of all of these steps. This year land cover/use is not reported because the data are only updated every five years and last year's report covers the most recent data available. Lake levels, biomass, and fire disturbance ECVs were included-at least partially-monitored-for the first time this year (see Chapter 2). Other variables important for research purposes are not included as ECVs, however the GCOS list of ECVs as well as the variables presented in this report are continually reassessed as improved observing technologies emerge. Continual advancement of the number of ECVs reported herein will not be possible without increasing international efforts to make the observations of the underlying variables and provide access to these data. A brief overview of the findings in this report is presented in the Abstract and shown in Fig. 1.1. The remainder of the report is organized starting with global scale climate variables in Chapter 2, into increasingly divided geographic regions described in chapters 3 through 7. Chapter 3 highlights the global ocean and Chapter 4 includes tropical climate phenomena such as El Ni\u00f1o and hurricanes. The Arctic and Antarctic respond differently through time and hence are reported in separate chapters. For a regional perspective authored largely by local government climate specialists, see Chapter 7. Seasonal patterns are encapsulated in Chapter 8.    ECVs, see GCOS 2003) and their monitoring status, as reported in this and recent editions of the State of the Climate, are listed with the following color coding: Green indicates this ECV is being monitored on a global or near-global scale and that this report includes a section describing its changes over time; Yellow indicates the ECV is explicitly discussed in this year's State of the Climate, but the data are not updated globally through the year or a dataset has not yet been adequately documented in the peer-reviewed literature to prove it is an accurate indication of how this ECV has changed over time; Red indicates more work needs to be done in order to monitor this ECV. The missing ECVs in 2007 reflect the evolution and expansion of the GCOS list. 2. GLOBAL CLIMATE-K. M. Willett, L. V. Alexander, and P. W. Thorne, Eds. a. Summary-L. V. Alexander In 2009, a transition from La Ni\u00f1a to El Ni\u00f1o dominated anomalies in many climate variables from the surface to the lower stratosphere. Averaged over the year, there was large-scale surface and tropospheric warmth and stratospheric coolness, except in the Arctic where positive annual anomalies were dominated by the largest stratospheric warming in January in the 50-year record (Plate 2.1). The ENSO transition, which occurred during the boreal summer, contributed to 2009 being ranked in the top 10 warmest years globally, about 0.1\u00b0C warmer than 2008. Global average surface temperatures during the last three decades have been progressively warmer than all earlier decades, making 2000-09 (the 2000s) the warmest decade in the instrumental record. The 2000s were also the warmest decade on record in the lower troposphere, being about 0.6\u00b0C warmer than the 1960s and 0.2\u00b0C warmer than the 1990s. The decadal warming has been particularly apparent in the mid-and high-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. This chapter also includes a sidebar on the veracity of and supporting evidence for the surface temperature records following much recent discussion in the popular media. Globally averaged surface temperature anomalies are shown to be robust given the close agreement between independentlyderived datasets and strong corroborative evidence across a wide range of other climate variables. Cloud and moisture increased in the tropical Pacific although there was no distinctive ENSO signature in annual surface pressure, owing to the cancelling effect of the shift from La Ni\u00f1a to El Ni\u00f1o. Preliminary data indicate a high probability that 2009 will be the 19th consecutive year that glaciers have lost mass. Precipitation anomalies were variable but most marked was a drying over the tropical Atlantic coincident with the position of ITCZ. Greenhouse gas concentrations continued to rise in 2009, with CO 2 increasing at a rate above the 1978 to 2008 average. Ozone-depleting gas concentrations continued to decline although some halogens such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons are increasing globally. Total-column ozone concentrations are still well below pre-1980 levels but have seen a recent reduction in the rate of decline, while upper stratospheric ozone has shown continued signs of ongoing slow recovery in 2009. This year's global chapter incorporates additional climate variables over previous years. There is not a section on land cover because there are limited annual updates to this variable. Land cover will be included in future summaries as updates become available. Advances and improvements in technology have enhanced our ability to monitor the Earth's climate using methods such as Global Positioning System Radio Occultation (see sidebar), which can be used to measure multiple meteorological parameters. Also included this year are lake levels (a proxy for precipitation changes over a catchment basin) and biomass burning (a proxy for land cover change and fire disturbance). In addition, for the first time, data from a reanalysis product have been included. This was possible through substantial recent improvements in reanalysis products. There is exciting potential to use analyses from these observing systems and combined products to enhance future global summaries. Publicly available datasets used in this chapter are included in Table 2.1 b. Temperatures 1) IntroductIon of reanalysIs data-P. W. Thorne This year for the first time there are fields from a reanalysis product within the global chapter. Reanalyses consist of modern day data assimilation schemes fed with all available historical observations. They produce spatially complete fields of a whole suite of meteorological parameters-both measured parameters and derived parameters such as potential vorticity. Papers documenting reanalyses are some of the most highly cited (e.g., Kalnay et al. 1996;Uppala et al. 2005), attesting to the high utility of reanalyses for a myriad of applications. They have not been included in the global chapter of State of the Climate to date because of well documented concerns about the ability of early reanalysis products to characterize long-term trends. The third generation of reanalysis products include substantial improvements as each successive effort has learned from previous efforts and taken advantage of developments in the sphere of weather forecasting. The ability of these much newer reanalysis products to characterize long-term changes in at least a subset of meteorological parameters has now been documented (e.g., Simmons et al. 2010). As a first step towards their more comprehensive inclusion in future State of the Climate reports this year there are results from the European Centre for Medium Range Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-40 and ERA-interim reanalyses (Simmons et al. 2010) incorporated into the three temperature sections. It is hoped that in future years these can be augmented by other third generation reanalysis products from NASA (MERRA, Bosilovich 2008), JRA-55 from the Japan Meteorologi-  cal Agency, and NCEP (CFFSR, Saha et al. 2010) and others as they complete and that these reanalyses can be incorporated for additional variables where deemed appropriate by the section authors. 2) Global surface temperatures-M. J. Menne and J. J. Kennedy Global surface temperatures in 2009 saw a return to near-record levels as the cooling in the tropical Pacific associated with the 2007/08 La Ni\u00f1a event gave way to strengthening El Ni\u00f1o conditions in 2009 ( Fig. 2.1). This led to large areas of the tropics experiencing higher-thanaverage temperatures towards the end of the year. According to the three major surface temperature datasets (Fig. 2.2, NASA/ GISS, Hansen et al. 2001;HadCRUT3, Brohan et al. 2006;and NOAA/NCDC;Reynolds 2005, Smith et al. 2008) 2009 averaged about 0.1\u00b0C warmer than 2008, which was the coolest year since 2000. Anomalies from the 1961-90 average for 2009 were 0.50\u00b0C, 0.44\u00b0C, and 0.46\u00b0C, respectively, and 0.37\u00b0C, 0.31\u00b0C, and 0.38\u00b0C for 2008. Analyses are based on air temperature data over land and SSTs derived from ship and buoy reports with independently derived adjustments to account for changes in observing-system bias. The three institutions use different reconstruction and interpolation techniques (Table 2.2), hence the analyses differ in some details, especially in data sparse regions and in the specifics of yearly rankings. Nevertheless, the three reconstructions are in close agreement regarding the low-frequency variations in the surface temperature signal as indicated in Fig. 2.2. Higher values in the NASA/GISS analysis in recent years may be a consequence of the Hansen et al. (2001) approach to interpolating and averaging temperature anomalies across the data sparse high Arctic where positive anomalies have been particularly large during the last few years. The tendency for much above-average temperatures in the high-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere continued in 2009 (Plate 2.1). Above average temperatures were also prevalent across much of Europe and Asia, Mexico, Africa, and Australia whereas cooler-than-average conditions occurred across the southern oceans, central Siberia, and the region spanning southern Canada and the north central contiguous United States. Unusual warmth was widespread t hroughout t he year. Southern Asia and north Africa were exceptionally warm in all seasons, in contrast the northern  U.S. and Canada were cooler than average for much of the year. In mid-December 2009 the Arctic Oscillation index turned strongly negative setting a pattern of colder-than-average temperatures over northern Eurasia and the U.S., coupled with warmer-than-average temperatures over the polar regions, southern Eurasia, and Canada that persisted throughout the winter. Nevertheless, December 2009 (and the rest of the winter season) was well above average in the North Hemisphere despite headlines about the unusual cold and snowy winter. The uncertainties in deriving the global mean surface temperature imply that 2009 is statistically indistinguishable from the other high-ranking years shown in Fig. 2.2. Year to year variability is dominated by natural variability such as ENSO, but the effects of external climate forcings are expected to manifest themselves at decadal and longer time scales (Alley et al. 2007). Each of the last three decades was warmer than all earlier decades in the instrumental record ( Fig. 2.3) and each set a new and statistically significant record, culminating in the 2000s, which was the warmest decade of all. 3) lower tropospherIc temperatures-J. Christy, M. Free, C. Mears, and L. Haimberger The 2009 global average temperature of the lower tropospheric layer (TLT, surface to ~8 km, see Fig. 2.2 in Karl et al. 2006) was approximately +0.3\u00b0C above the 1979 -98 average. The first half of the year was near the decade's average but the troposphere subsequently warmed quickly in response to the developing warm phase of ENSO (Fig. 2.4). When the tropical Pacific ocean experiences these large temperature anomalies, the atmosphere above responds with similar temperature changes which, for the global average, lag the surface fluctuations by two to four months (Christy and McNider 1994). In the 31 (satellite) and 52 (radiosonde) years of records, 2009 ranked as the sixth or seventh warmest (depending upon the choice of dataset) in the lower troposphere, being around 0.2\u00b0C to 0.3\u00b0C cooler than the warmest (El Ni\u00f1o) year of 1998. Areas in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes, including central North America, north Atlantic, northern Asia, along with the Antarctic Peninsula were below the base-period average. North polar regions, south Asia, Atlantic-Indian ocean basin, and much of the tropics were on average warmer than the mean (Plate 2.1)."}, {"section_title": "S26", "text": "JULY 2010"}, {"section_title": "|", "text": "Although the IPCC AR4 concluded that \"warming of the climate system is unequivocal,\" public debate over the evidence for global warming continues. However, it is often confined to a small set of reiterated disputes about Land Surface Air Temperature (LSAT) records, diverting attention from the broader evidence basis. The methods used to derive the principal estimates of global sur face t e m p e r a t u r e t r e n d s -HadCRUT3 (Brohan et al. 2006), NOA A , and NASA/GISS (Hansen et al. 2001)-are largely independent (Table  2.2). So, the spread of the three estimates indicates the likely degree of uncertainty in the evolution of the global mean surface temperature. It is noteworthy that independentlyderived estimates of tropospheric temperature trends for the whole troposphere channel (distinct from section 2b2) from satellites differ by an order of magnitude more than do estimated surface temperature trends (Thorne et al. 2010, manuscript submitted to Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change). Numerous studies attest to the robustness of the global LSAT records and their nonreliance on individual stations (e.g., Jones et al. 1997;Peterson et al. 1999;Parker et al. 2009;Menne et al. 2010). Evidence from recent reanalyses lends further support (Simmons et al. 2010). The IPCC conclusion (Alley et al. 2007) that \"warming of the climate system is unequivocal\" does not rest solely upon LSAT records. These constitute only one line of evidence HOW DO WE kNOW THE WORLD HAS WARMED?-J. J. Kennedy, P. W. Thorne, T. C. Peterson, R. A. Ruedy, P. A. Stott, D. E. Parker, S. A. Good, H. A. Titchner, and K. M. Willett among many, for example: uptake of heat by the oceans, melting of land ice such as glaciers, the associated rise in sea level, and increased atmospheric surface humidity (Fig. 2.5). If the land surface records were systematically flawed and the globe had not really warmed, then it would be almost impossible to explain the concurrent changes in this wide range of indicators produced by many independent groups. The observed changes in a broad range of indicators provide a self-consistent story of a warming world. Unrealistic outliers and segments of station series were eliminated after manual inspection.\nTrends in the MOC can also be determined through proxies of the MOC strength, such as paleo observations (e.g., Carlson et al. 2008), tracers (e.g., LeBel et al. 2008), and water mass characteristics (e.g., Kouketsu et al. 2009;Lohmann et al. 2008;Hawkins and Sutton 2007). For example during the past year, temperature and salinity observations in the Labrador Sea showed an abrupt return of deep convection between 2007 and 2008 (V\u00e5ge et al. 2009). Yashayaev and Loder (2009) showed that the enhanced deep convection in the Labrador Sea in the winter of 2008 was the deepest since 1994 and included the largest heat loss from the ocean to the atmosphere since the mid-1990s, exceeding the long-term mean by 50%. Such anomalous local events may be a precursor to changes in the MOC strength (e.g., Lohmann et al. 2009;Bellucci et al. 2008). Large-scale changes in temperature and salinity can also provide an indication of circulation changes; for example, Kouketsu et al. (2009) and Johnson et al. (2008a) showed that deep water temperature changes are consistent with a slowing of the deep circulation. Miller, G. Mitchum, S. Nerem, and P. Woodworth The dominant changes in sea level during 2009 were associated with a moderate El Ni\u00f1o event that peaked at the end of the year. We first describe quarterly sea level anomalies, which illustrate the sea level signature of the El Ni\u00f1o event, followed by the 2009 annual mean relative to a long-term mean and to the 2008 mean, which we treat as the present sea level tendency. We conclude with an update on global sea level rise and a brief description of daily sea level extremes observed at coastal and island tide gauges in 2009. The La Ni\u00f1a event that developed in 2007 and persisted through 2008 was still evident during January-February-March 2009 (JFM 09) with high/low sea surface height (SSH) anomalies in the western/eastern tropical Pacific (Fig. 3.21). Positive anomalies extended throughout the Indonesian Archipelago into the tropical Indian Ocean and southward along the west coast of Australia. The La Ni\u00f1a weakened noticeably along the western equatorial Pacific during April-May-June 2009 (AMJ 09) with the excitation of a downwelling Kelvin wave that created positive SSH anomalies in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific. The size of the positive SSH anomalies in the western Pacific warm pool region also began to diminish during AMJ 09 presumably due to weakening trade winds to the east. The high SSH anomalies in the eastern tropical Pacific increased in amplitude during July -August-September 2009 and peaked in October-November-December 2009 (OND 09). By OND 09 the high water levels in the western equatorial Pacific had largely subsided to background levels with the exception of a branch of high water level near the South Pacific Convergence Zone. Most of these changes in equatorial sea level are associated with changes in regional ocean heat content (see section 3c.). Averaged over the entire year, the SSH anomaly includes contributions from the weakening La Ni\u00f1a state and the strengthening El Ni\u00f1o with high water levels across the equatorial Pacific ( Fig. 3.22, top panel). The low levels along the Pacific coast of North America with high levels in the central North Pacific suggest the dominance of the negative phase of the PDO. High anomalies occur along the paths of the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio extensions, suggesting either a strengthening or meridional shift of those currents. In general, sea level appears to be unusually high in the Indian Ocean relative to the 1993-2002 baseline with the exception of the mid-to highlatitude North Pacific and North Atlantic and in the southern tropical Atlantic. The coastal tide gauge and SSH levels are similar at most stations. The SSH tendency ( Fig. 3.22, bottom panel) shows the seesaw shift in water levels in the tropical Pacific caused by the El Ni\u00f1o event. SSH tended to drop in the Indian Ocean, except for a band south of the equator extending from Australia to Madagascar. Levels along the coast of Australia decreased from 2008 to 2009 due to the propagation of upwelling variable Kelvin waves along the coast during the El Ni\u00f1o event. The rate of global mean sea level (GMSL) rise is estimated currently to be 3.1 \u00b1 0.4 mm yr -1 (3.4 mm yr -1 with correction for global isostatic adjustment) ( Fig. 3.23). Nerem et al. (2010, manuscript submitted to Marine Geodesy) and Leuliette and Scharroo (2010, manuscript submitted to Marine Geodesy) provide recent updates of the GMSL trend calculation. Variations in GMSL about the long-term trend tend to correlate with ENSO. This is evident as GMSL dips below the long-term trend during the 2007-08 La Ni\u00f1a event and returns to the long-term trend with perhaps slightly higher values during the latter part of 2009 and the current El Ni\u00f1o event. Because of the combination of the trend and the El Ni\u00f1o, GMSL levels at the end of 2009 were generally the highest over the length of the altimeter record. Variations in GMSL due to changes in ocean density (steric sea level) and ocean mass are currently under investigation using satellite altimeters, the Argo array (measuring ocean temperature and salinity), and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) time series (measuring ice melt and other hydrological variations). An update to the analysis of Leuliette and Miller (2009) using an additional year of steric observations from Argo profiles and ocean mass variations from the GRACE gravity mission of sea level continues to show that the sea level rise budget can be closed within the range of uncertainties ( Fig. 3.24). For the period January 2004 to March 2009, total sea level rise measured by the Jason-1 and Jason-2 altimeters is 2.7 mm yr -1 . In areas more than 200 km from the nearest coast, the altimeter rate is 1.8 \u00b1 1.1 mm yr -1 , while the combination of the steric and ocean mass components is 1.4 \u00b1 0.6 mm yr -1 or 2.3 \u00b1 0.6 mm yr -1 , depending on the choice of a glacial isostatic adjustment correction. Extreme water levels during 2009 are examined using daily averages obtained from a global set of tide gauges (Fig. 3.25). Extreme levels, taken as the average of the 2% highest daily values relative to the annual mean level (top panel), were high along the coasts of North America, Europe, South Australia, and in the  eastern Bay of Bengal. For time series with at least 15 years of record length, we normalize the levels by removing the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of extreme sea levels for all available years ( Fig. 3.25, bottom panel). By this measure, extremes along the east coast of the United States (see Sweet et al. 2009 for a description of the summer 2009 sea level anomalies in this region), the south coast of Alaska, and at South Africa were notably higher than normal. Other areas of unusually high values include eastern and southern Australia and isolated stations in Hawaii and the South Pacific. Extremes were generally below normal along the west coast of Canada, at Chile, Scandinavia, Thailand, and at island stations in the western equatorial Pacific. Global ocean surface ocean CO 2 levels are extremely variable in space and time, especially on seasonal time scales. To document the changing patterns of air-sea CO 2 exchange requires an extensive observational program. The latest global flux map, based on a compilation of approximately three million measurements collected between 1970 and 2007, provides information on the monthly patterns of airsea fluxes during a \"normal\" non-El Ni\u00f1o year taken to be 2000 (Takahashi et al. 2009a). The number of annual surface CO 2 observations has been growing exponentially since the 1960s such that today well over one million observations are reported to data centers each year. This tremendous increase in the number of annual observations provides exciting opportunities to look at the patterns of air-sea CO 2 fluxes in greater detail to understand the seasonal to interannual variations and the mechanisms controlling them. As a compliment to Takahashi's work  \nArctic Islands (Fig. 5.19a). The period 1988-2007 was selected as the historical reference period for these anomaly calculations to place the anomalies in the context of more recent snow cover condi-tions following a rapid reduction in hemispheric snow cover during the 1980s. When standardized SCD anomalies were calculated for NOAA grid cells north of 60\u00b0N and averaged for North America and Eurasia, negative SCD anomalies were evident across Eurasia in the fall and the entire Arctic in spring (Fig. 5.19b). The shorter-than-average snow season in 2008/09 occurred in spite of slightly deeper-than-average snow depth (relative to the 1998-2009 average) in many parts of the Arctic (Fig. 5.19c), as identified by the daily global snow depth analysis (produced by combining the available ground observations with a snow model) from the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC, Brasnett 1999). Snowmelt onset anomalies determined from the QuikSCAT record (2000-09) derived with the algorithm of Wang et al. (2008) show that the initial timing of snowmelt in 2009 was near normal, or slightly later than normal across large regions of western Siberia, northern Europe, and the Canadian tundra (Fig. 5.19d). Collectively, these datasets suggest that although the snowpack was not anomalously shallow, and melt was initiated near the average time, the melt was of sufficient intensity to rapidly remove the snowpack across large regions of the Arctic. These observations are consistent with an intensification of snow-related high-latitude hydrological processes as discussed in Dery et al. (2009).\n\u2022 Significant ice loss has occurred along the Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctica in the last decade. In 2002, the Larsen B Ice Shelf on the east side of the Peninsula disintegrated, likely due to the regional warming (see above) (Marshall et al. 2006). In 2008/09, part of the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the west side of the Peninsula collapsed, more likely due to influences other than regional warming (Scambos et al. 2009). More recently, ice loss has been reported in the Pine Island Bay region of West Antarctica (Rignot 2002), due perhaps to oceanic influences (Payne et al. 2007). \u2022 All-time positive records of continentaveraged sea ice extent were reached in December 2007, andMarch-April 2008, in conjunction with a small but significant increase in overall sea ice extent over the last 30 years (Fogt et al. 2009a). Embedded in this signal are large regional departures: during the last three decades there was an anomalous decrease in sea ice in the Amundsen/Bellingshausen Seas, especially in winter, and an anomalous increase in sea ice extent in the Ross Sea sector. \u2022 The 2008/09 Antarctic-wide austral summer snowmelt was the lowest in the 30-yr history (Tedesco and Monaghan 2009). \u2022 Many of the climate impacts can be related back to changes in the overlying atmospheric circulation and, in particular, the average positive phase of the SAM. Figure 6.1c shows that although the SAM weakened somewhat during the 2000/09 decade, it still remained positive on average (compared to the 1979-2008 mean) during all seasons except austral spring. It is widely accepted that the strong positive phase of the SAM in austral summer can be traced back to stratospheric ozone depletion and greenhouse gas increases (Fogt et al. 2009b;Arblaster and Meehl 2006;Shindell and Schmidt 2004;Thompson and Solomon 2002). \u2022 The Antarctic ozone hole reached its maximum area (27.7 million km 2 ) on 24 September 2006, larger than the North American continent. Due to large interannual variability, it is unclear yet whether or not the ozone hole has begun a slow recovery process. Many of these impressive conditions during the last decade, and projections for the Antarctic climate over the next 100 years, are described in more detail in the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research  Fig. 6.3. Primary  contour interval is 50 m in (a), 1 K in (b), and 2 m s -1 in (c), with  additional contours at \u00b1 25 m, \u00b1 0.5 K, \u00b1 1 m s -1 in (a), (b), and (c), respectively.

(SCAR) report \"Antarctic Climate Change and the Environment,\" which was released in November 2009. This report not only parallels the climate discussion on the following pages, but also includes paleoclimatic changes, oceanic changes, and changes in the marine/terrestrial biosphere.\nanomalies observed in the Ross Sea and along the Antarctic coast between 100\u00b0E to 140\u00b0E [ Fig. 6.5d]). These circulation anomalies produced three P-E anomaly features along the Antarctic coast in 2008 ( Fig. 6.5b): positive anomalies over the Ross Ice Shelf and near Casey station (110\u00b0E) and a negative center over the Balleny Islands (165\u00b0E). In 2009, a strong negative pressure anomaly center was observed near the Drake Passage (Fig. 6.5c). The circulation about this low pressure in 2009 produced stronger offshore flow and less precipitation to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula, leading to the P-E minimum along coastal West Antarctica (Fig. 6.5a). Further, 2009 was also marked with a positive MSLP anomaly center at 15\u00b0E (Fig. 6.5c). This pressure anomaly brought more moisture from the ocean into the region along the coast between 0\u00b0 to 60\u00b0E, where the 2009 annual positive P-E anomalies have increased to more than double the 2008 values. The austral spring (SON) and autumn (MAM) P-E anomalies (not shown) have the largest impact on 2009 annual P-E anomalies. The SON anomalies contribute nearly 40% of the annual P-E coastal values. A strong negative MSLP anomaly in SON 2008 from 120\u00b0E eastward to a dominant center near 100\u00b0W has been replaced by a strong positive center at 125\u00b0W, nearly a 20-hPa change (i.e., Fig. 6.3e). This indicates less-than-normal storm activity during the 2009 SON season that results in the change to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula from large positive to large negative P-E anomalies.   . 2008-2009 Seasonal melt extent andduration-L. Wang, K. C. Jezek, and Summer surface snow melt on the Antarctic Ice Sheet during 2008/09 was estimated using 19-GHz horizontal-polarization channel SSM/I data. We applied a wavelet transform-based edge detection method (Liu et al. 2005) to the daily time series of brightness temperatures for individual SSM/I grid cells to detect and track the surface melt occurrences. Surface melt extent and duration maps are shown in Fig. 6.6. The total melt extent is 681 900 km 2 , which includes all areas with at least one day of surface melting during the 2008/09 austral summer. The melt extent covers only 4.9% of the continent, which is considerably smaller than the average melt percentage (about 9.3%) over the past 27 years (Liu et al. 2006). The integrated melt index (the summation over the continent of the product of melt duration times the pixel area) during 2008/09 is 20 533 000 day km 2 . Both melt extent and melt index for the entire ice sheet are smaller than the last year (800 000 km 2 for melt extent and 24 354 000 day km 2 for melt index), consistent with the decreasing trend of the past six years. Melt extent and melt index for the austral summer 2008/09 are record lows for the period of passive microwave satellite observations that began in 1978 (Tedesco and Monaghan 2009). The Antarctic Peninsula, Amery Ice Shelf, West Ice Shelf, and Shackleton Ice Shelf (see Fig. 6.6a for locations) have relatively longer melt durations than other regions. Abbot Ice Shelf and the small ice shelves in Queen Maud Land have melt durations of less than two weeks. No surface melt was detected on the Ronne-Filchner Ice Shelf, Ross Ice Shelf, Victoria Land, or on Wilkes Land (Fig. 6.6). The surface melt onset date and end date varies spatially, as shown in Figs. 6.6b,c. Surface melt events primarily took place in January (Fig. 6.6d). f. Sea ice extent and concentration-R. A. Massom, P. Reid, S. Stammerjohn, and S. Barreira After a maximum in zonally-averaged sea ice extent (based on the satellite passive microwave record) in December 2008 (monthly average of 11.2 x 10 6 km 2 , or ~1.0 x 10 6 km 2 above the long-term mean for 1979-2008), anomalies in January 2009 were generally well above average (~0.8 x 106 km 2 ) but dipped dramatically to be slightly below average in February. For much of the rest of the year, overall sea ice extent and area were above average or close to average, with seasonal peaks in April (extent +1.0 x 10 6 km 2 ) and late September (+0.5 x 10 6 km 2 ). Starting in October, however, there was a decrease in zonally-averaged extent that lasted through mid-December 2009. Embedded in the zonally-averaged sea ice extent are again strong regional contrasts in the sea ice record, in accordance with recent observations (e.g., Comiso and Nishio 2008;Stammerjohn et al. 2008). In many regions, and especially during early 2009, regional sea ice extent anomalies were generally consistent with long-term (30-year) regional trends (Fig. 6.7a): negative in the Bellingshausen Sea and western Weddell Sea (January through June/July), the W Pacific sector from ~90\u00b0E-120\u00b0E (February-December) and in the eastern Ross Sea (January-March); positive in the central-eastern Weddell Sea (January-June/July) and the western and central Ross Sea (January-June and January-October, respectively); and a largely neutral/mixed signal over much of the Indian Ocean sector (January-April), the W Pacific sector from 120\u00b0E-145\u00b0E (throughout the year), and the Amundsen Sea (January-May). Not all regional sea ice extent anomalies were consistent with long-term (30-year) regional trends. Most notable was the regional departure from long-term trends that began in October 2009 that was associated with a distinct hemispheric wave-3 pattern in that month. Distinct sea ice extent anomalies occurred in two regions due to the presence of a high pressure anomaly centered on 120\u00b0W (reflected in Fig. 6.3e): positive in the Bellingshausen-Amundsen Seas (BAS) region and negative in the eastern Ross Sea (Fig. 6.7c). Similarly, a negative sea ice extent anomaly developed in the western Ross Sea, caused by a low MSLP/storm center west of the high pressure center (Fig. 6.3e). This coincides with the development (from October onwards) of a warm pool of SSTs in the central South Pacific that persisted through December. From October, departures in regional sea ice extent are up to 3.4 standard deviations away from the (untrended) mean and are in distinct contrast to the long-term regional trends. This is particularly evident by comparing the areas of the BAS-NW Weddell Sea and Ross Sea sectors for April (similar to the trend, Fig. 6.7e) and November (opposite to the trends, Figs. 6.7b,c).Other less obvious departures from the long-term mean were the large negative and positive anomalies that persisted in the NW and central-NE Weddell Sea (CNEWS) from January through July that subsequently advected eastwards with the surface waters of the Weddell Gyre (Venegas and Drinkwater 2001;Fig. 6.7a). This resulted in a switch to a strong negative anomaly in CNEWS accompanied by a strong positive anomaly from ~0\u00b0-60\u00b0E (inconsistent with the long-term trend) for the remainder of the year, while the NW Weddell Sea and Bellingshausen Sea switched to positive/ near-neutral anomalies. A progressive eastward advection/propagation is also noted in positive anomalies from the W Ross Sea to the Amundsen Sea. This propagation may be consistent with sea ice drift data (under investigation) and, for the Ross-Amundsen Seas, consistent with Assmann et al. (2005). Consistent with the monthly sea ice extent anomalies (Fig. 6.7a), the ice-edge advance anomalies (not shown) further highlight the late-autumn advance in the Bellingshausen, Western Weddell, and outer central Weddell Sea regions, as well as in East Antarctica between 100\u00b0E and 140\u00b0E. In contrast, early sea ice advance anomalies are found in most of the Ross Sea and the inner pack ice zone of the Weddell Sea. In further contrast, the ice edge retreat anomalies (also not shown) generally tell a different regional sea ice anomaly story. For example, they show late retreat almost everywhere but in the eastern Ross Sea, the outer pack ice of the Weddell Sea, and the inshore region of the southern Bellingshausen Sea. Thus, as a result, the ice season duration anomaly (Fig.  6.7d) shows a longer ice season in most areas except in East Antarctica (between 100\u00b0E and 140\u00b0E), the outer western Weddell Sea, and the inshore region in the Bellingshausen Sea. As highlighted by the sea ice extent anomalies (Fig. 6.7a), the most striking seasonal changes include a switch from late sea ice advance and low sea ice concentration anomalies (blue, Fig. 6.7b) to late sea ice retreat and high sea ice concentration anomalies (red, Fig. 6.7c) in most of the Bellingshausen Sea. This stands in contrast to the switch from early sea ice advance to early sea ice retreat in the western Amundsen/eastern Ross Sea (~140\u00b0W-160\u00b0W). This seasonal flip in the sign of regional ice anomalies in the high-latitude South Pacific is, however, consistent with moderate La Ni\u00f1a/+SAM conditions prevailing during late 2008/early 2009 versus moderate El Ni\u00f1o/-SAM conditions prevailing late in 2009 (e.g., Stammerjohn et al. 2008;Fogt and Bromwich 2006). Nonetheless, the 2009 positive ice-season duration anomalies for most of the BAS region are in contrast to the strong long-term negative trend in that region, whereas the negative duration anomalies in the outer western Weddell Sea and in East Antarctica (100\u00b0E-140\u00b0E) are in contrast to the weak but positive trend in those regions (Fig.  6.7e). These negative duration anomalies are however consistent with the eastward \"propagation\" of ice extent anomalies in the regions in 2009, as described earlier (see Fig. 6.7a). In these regions, i.e., the outer Bellingshausen and western Weddell Seas and East Antarctica, the 2009 anomalies are >2 standard deviations above/below the long-term mean. The 2009 Antarctic ozone hole was comparable in size to previous ozone holes. The area of the hole was approximately 22.9 million km 2 , about the same size as 2007 and smaller than the 2006 record of 27.7 million km 2 . While 2009 was smaller than many recent sizable ozone holes, it is still much larger than values observed prior to 1990. The large area of the ozone hole is consistent with severe depletion caused by the continued high levels of chlorine a nd brom i ne i n t he Antarctic stratosphere. At present, we estimate t hat ozone depleting substances (ODSs) have only decreased by about 4.3% from the peak levels in the 2000-02 period. Figure 6.8a displays the average area of the Antarctic ozone hole from 1979 to 2009. The average is calculated by 1) summing the area of the daily values from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and Aura Ozone Monit o r i n g I n s t r u m e n t (OM I) ob s e r v at ion s where total ozone values are less than 220 Dobson Units and then 2) averaging the daily estimates from 21-30 September. Using daily SBUV total ozone from the NOAA polar orbiter satellites, the 2009 Antarctic ozone hole was estimated to be the 10th largest on record. The total ozone values over Antarctica steadily decreased from July to early October 2009. Aura OMI observations showed ozone values of about 236 Dobson Units in July and a low value of 94 Dobson Units on 26 September 2009. Balloon-borne ozonesonde observations from NOAA/ESRL at the South Pole also showed similar behavior. On 25 September, total ozone estimated from the sonde was 98 Dobson Units. The ozonesonde profiles in Fig. 6.8b show that the large losses occurred in the lower stratosphere by late September, with a near complete loss of ozone in the 15-20 km layer on Sep. 29. The temperature variability of the Antarctic stratosphere modulates the severity of the ozone hole from year to year. Colder-than-average Antarctic temperatures result in larger and deeper ozone holes, while \nTemperatures across Puerto Rico ranged from 7.2\u00b0C in Adjuntas, which was recorded on both 28 February and 23 March, to 36.1\u00b0C in Ponce, which occurred on 30 July and 10 August. By the end of the year, 2009 ranked as the 4th warmest year since record began at the Luis Mu\u00f1oz Marin International Airport in 1956 (the daily mean temperature was 27.4\u00b0C versus the 30-year normal of 26.6\u00b0C). Temperatures across the U.S. Virgin Islands ranged from 15\u00b0C at Beth Upper New Works near Christiansted on Saint Croix (recorded on 14 and 28 January), to 34.4\u00b0C, also at Beth Upper New Works (on 20 July). The annual mean temperatures at the Cyril E. King Airport on Saint Thomas, and at the Christiansted Airport on Saint Croix, were both 27.2\u00b0C in 2009; these values ranked near their long-term average of 27.2\u00b0C and 27.6\u00b0C, respectively.\nThe most significant area of above-normal rainfall was in northern Queensland (Fig 7.51), where most of the region between about 17\u00b0S and 21\u00b0S had annual rainfall in the highest decile with some areas around Mount Isa experiencing their wettest year on record. Smaller areas in the highest decile were scattered through tropical Western Australia, the Northern Territory, the West Kimberley region, the northern coast of New South Wales, and in southeastern Tasmania around Hobart. The two most significant dry areas were in central Australia and on the southeast coast. Annual rainfall was in the lowest decile along the southeast coast and the adjacent inland region between Wollongong and Melbourne and in much of the southern Northern Territory. In northeastern South Australia, Moomba only had 11 mm from January to mid-November. There were smaller areas in the lowest decile in inland southeast Queensland and along the southern half of Western Australia's west coast (including Perth). The bulk of the tropical rainfall fell in January and early February, with northern Queensland wet-season rainfall being the highest since 1990/91. Conditions through most northern and central areas became much drier from March onwards, and a number of locations in northwestern Queensland and the central Northern Territory had no rain between early April and late November. Wet conditions returned in December as a result of Tropical Cyclone Laurence. The January-May period was dry across much of southern Australia, especially Victoria and southwest Western Australia, where it ranked as the third-and fifth-driest on record, respectively. Kalbarri (Western Australia) did not record its first rain of 2009 until 20 May. Rainfall returned to more normal levels from June onwards, leading to a good winter cropping season in many areas. Nevertheless, annual rainfall was 19% below normal for Victoria and 15% below normal for the Murray-Darling Basin, continuing the longterm droughts in these regions which commenced in 1997 and 2001, respectively. Tasmania had an extremely wet winter and early spring, with June-September rainfall the second highest on record. Despite dry conditions early and late in the year, these rains were sufficient for the state's annual rainfall to be 8% above normal. (iii) Notable events There were three exceptional heat waves in Australia during 2009, all of which saw records broken by large margins over wide areas. The first occurred in late January and early February, affecting southeast-ern Australia, and was accompanied by widespread loss of life resulting from extreme heat and bushfires. Major heat waves also occurred in August in much of tropical and subtropical eastern Australia and in November in most of the Southeast (see sidebar) The heavy tropical rains early in the year resulted in widespread flooding, especially in Queensland. Floods persisted for several weeks on many rivers in northwestern Queensland. Floodwaters from the Georgina River eventually led to a partial filling of Lake Eyre. Further east, there was major flooding on a number of coastal rivers in coastal Queensland. The worst impacts were in the vicinity of Ingham, which received 949 mm of rainfall in a six day period, 30 January-4 February. A section of the northern New South Wales coast centered on Coffs Harbour was subject to repeated flooding with five significant events during the year. The most widespread, in late May, extended north to the Clarence River catchment and parts of southeast Queensland. Property damage was mostly minor, but there was one death in the Coffs Harbour area and the town of Yamba was isolated for nine days. At the end of the year, tropical cyclone Laurence made landfall at category 5 intensity, between Broome and Port Hedland after an earlier landfall east of Derby. Moisture from its remnants fed into an inland trough and resulted in flooding in parts of northern inland New South Wales during the last week of December. Dust storms affected eastern Australia on a number of occasions in late September and early October. The most significant, on 22-23 September, reduced visibility to below 200 meters over a vast area, including the cities of Sydney, Brisbane, and Canberra. This is believed to be the most extensive dust storm of such intensity since at least the 1940s. The most significant severe thunderstorms of the year affected northern Tasmania on 15 April, with some property damage and widespread power outages. A tornado passed directly over an automatic weather station at Scottsdale, with a gust of 194 km hr -1 recorded. (iv) Significant statistics \u2022 Mean annual maximum temperature anomaly: +1.04\u00b0C \u2022 Mean annual minimum temperature anomaly: +0.76\u00b0C \u2022 Mean annual rainfall anomaly: -3% Australia experienced three exceptional heat waves during 2009, with records broken by huge margins and with major loss of life through both extreme heat and bushfires. January/February-The first heat wave affected southeastern Australia on 27 January-8 February. Between 27 January and 31 January, the state capitals Adelaide and Melbourne had four and three consecutive days, respectively, above 43\u00b0C, both of which were records. Large areas of southern Victoria and Tasmania set all-time records. A new state record for Tasmania was set with 42.2\u00b0C at Scamander on the 30th. Extreme day and nighttime heat (including a record high minimum of 33.9\u00b0C at Adelaide on the 29th) caused severe heat stress, with 374 excess deaths occurring in Victoria. Extreme heat returned to South Australia on 6 February and to Victoria and New South Wales on the 7th (Fig. 7.52), with an all-time record of 46.4\u00b0C at Melbourne and a Victorian state record of 48.8\u00b0C at Hopetoun. Of 35 long-term stations in Victoria, 24 set all-time records; six others set February records. The accompanying strong, dry northwesterly winds fanned bushfires which claimed 173 lives, mostly in areas northeast of Melbourne. August-Forty-nine percent of the continent, including most of Queensland and the Northern Territory, experienced its highest August mean maximum temperature on record, resulting in a new all-time record national maximum temperature anomaly of +3.20\u00b0C. Extreme heat occurred on 14-16 August, 21-25 August, and 29-30 August. A New South Wales August record of 37.8\u00b0C was set on the 24th at Mungindi, while a new Queensland record of 38.5\u00b0C was set on the 29th at Bedourie. Site records were broken by extremely large margins with numerous long-term stations setting August records by more than 4\u00b0C. Daily maximum temperature records were set over 25% of Australia, including 55% of Queensland. November-Persistent heat occurred across much of southeast Australia. All-time duration records were set in South Australia at Port Lincoln (eight consecutive days above 30\u00b0C) and Murray Bridge (six consecutive days above 40\u00b0C); these were particularly extraordinary as extended heat waves in southern Australia have been almost entirely confined to the second half of summer and early autumn. Adelaide's eight consecutive days above 35\u00b0C was double its previous November record. Daily record high temperatures for November occurred over 41% of New South Wales, including a state November record of 46.8\u00b0C at Wanaaring on the 20th. The mean monthly temperature anomaly for New South Wales was +4.61\u00b0C, the largest recorded for any Australian state, with Victoria (+4.36\u00b0C) also breaking the previous record. (In Victoria, only one December has been hotter than November 2009). Eighty long-term stations had their largest monthly maximum temperature anomaly on record for any month, and Cowra's anomaly of +7.9\u00b0C was the largest recorded at any Australian station since 1914. 2) neW Zealand-g. m. griffiths New Zealand's climate for 2009 was characterized by frequent seesaws in extreme temperature. Heat waves occurred in January and the start of February; May was the coldest on record; August was the warmest August since records began; and October had its lowest temperatures since 1945. During individual months (notably September and November), daily maximum and minimum temperatures frequently broke long-standing records, with extremely cold temperatures often occurring within a week or so of record hot events. The decade 2000-09 was the warmest in the instrumental record for New Zealand.\nand Vanua Levu islands (Fiji) as a consequence of a hovering monsoonal trough, an enhanced South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ), two tropical depressions, and Tropical Cyclone Hettie. A total of 14 stations recorded at least 700 mm of rainfall during January, seven of them collecting more than 1000 mm. Overall, 75% of rain gauges in the Western, Central, and Eastern Divisions of Fiji recorded 200% of their average January rainfall. The related flooding is considered to be the country's worst in over 75 years, claiming 12 lives and causing substantial damages to agricultural crops, road, electricity, and water infrastructure. In December, category 2 Tropical Cyclone Mick lashed the islands of Yasawa and Viti Levu, Fiji. On 14 December, sustained wind speeds of up to 81.3 km hr -1 and gusts that reached 107.2 km hr -1 were recorded at Nausori Airport near Suva. Five deaths and severe damage to crops and livestock were reported. Typical of La Ni\u00f1a conditions, positive sea surface temperature anomalies were present around Vanuatu, New Caledonia, west and south of Fiji, and southern French Polynesia early in the year. From April to June, SSTs cooled in the Southwest Pacific, while positive anomalies developed in the western equatoria l Pacific after May. In October, the warm anomalies in the western Pacific dissipated and warm anomalies developed south of French Polynesia. In December, a large area of positive anomalies, with the central region exceeding +3\u00b0C, existed from 160\u00b0W-90\u00b0W and 30\u00b0S-65\u00b0S. Positive sea level anomalies existed in the Southwest Pacific in January from Papua New Guinea southeast to the Southern Cook Islands. Anomalies just east of Papua New Guinea exceeded +25 cm, while monthly mean sea levels at Fiji and Tonga were the highest on record. Monthly mean sea level at Fiji for February was, for a second month in a row, the highest on record. Tropical Cyclone Lin brought elevated sea levels to Tonga on 4 April 2009. Sea level at the height of the storm was 0.5 m higher than the predicted tide. Positive anomalies developed in the Southwest Pacific in May and extended almost to Rapa Island. In June, positive anomalies in the Southwest Pacific contracted both in area and magnitude but then expanded in July in the Southwest Pacific to the Southern Cook Islands. By September, the area with positive anomalies in This assessment covers the area from the date line west to 130\u00b0E, between the equator and 20\u00b0N. It includes the U.S.-affiliated Islands of Micronesia, but excludes the western islands of Kiribati. The climate of the region is strongly influenced by ENSO. The first few months of 2009 began as La Ni\u00f1a, switching to El Ni\u00f1o by the boreal summer, becoming moderate to strong by December. After two years with virtually no tropical cyclone activity in Micronesia, the monsoon trough and tropical cyclone genesis regions shifted eastward, typical of their response to El Ni\u00f1o ocean patterns. In August two super typhoons impacted some of the Micronesian islands. The high sea levels characteristic of 2008 began to fall by September 2009 in response to El Ni\u00f1o. This process continued for the remainder of the year as oceanic heat content was transported eastward toward South America."}, {"section_title": "Homogeneity adjustments", "text": "Visual and near-neighbor comparisons. c.20% of stations affected.

Decades 1960 -69 and1970-79, were cooler than 2000-09 by about 0.6\u00b0C, with 1980-89 cooler by about 0.35\u00b0C and 1990-99 cooler by 0.2\u00b0C. The overall trend for both radiosondes (since 1958) and satellites (since 1979) is approximately +0.15\u00b0C per decade. Empirically the 52-year time series (Fig. 2.4) may equally plausibly be divided into three periods of relative temperature stability with transitions to warmer temperatures in 1977 (about +0.35\u00b0C) and 1998 (about +0.32\u00b0C) (e.g., Seidel and Lanzante 2004). ECMWF Reanalyses  show that the warmest anomalies of 2000-09 were in the midand especially high-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.

Randel", "text": "The 2009 annual average temperature of the global lower stratosphere was similar to that of the previous 15 years (Fig. 2.7), ranking 7th to 10th coolest since 1979 according to the dataset. Globally-averaged, the recent temperatures were approximately 1.5\u00b0C cooler than estimates from the late 1950s-early 1960s, when the first systematic radiosonde measurements of the lower stratosphere began. The overall cooling trend is punctuated by transient warming from three large volcanic eruptions (section 2b3), and the time series of cooling appears as step changes after these volcanic events (Seidel and Lanzante 2004;Ramaswamy et al. 2006). The volcanic warming events are mainly evident in low latitudes (Fig. 2.8). The overall behavior of lower stratospheric temperature (TLS) shows reasonable agreement between radiosonde and satellite datasets for the post-1978 satellite period, although there are differences in detail between independent analyses of the radiosonde and satellite data (with the satellite data showing slightly less cooling than radiosondes). For the presatellite era , there is larger disagreement and more uncertainty in trends among the different radiosonde-based datasets. For the overall record 1958-2009, the global trend from the average of the datasets is -0.33 \u00b1 0.07\u00b0C per decade. For 1979, trends range from -0.57 to -0.30\u00b0C per decade; the mean trend for all datasets shown is -0.41\u00b0C per decade. Evolution of lower stratospheric temperatures from satellite measurements (Fig. 2.8) highlights relatively constant temperatures since ~1995, modulated by the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) in the tropics, plus large interannual variability in high-latitudes (during the respective winter-spring seasons). The QBO shifted from westerly to easterly winds in 2009, resulting in cold tropical lower stratosphere temperature anomalies in the second half of the year. The Arctic stratosphere was strongly influenced by a large stratospheric sudden warming in January 2009 (the largest in the 50-year record), resulting in rapid temperature increases of over 60\u00b0C in the polar middle and upper stratosphere (Fig. 2.9); the remainder of the Arctic winter (February-April) was relatively cold without large dynamic variability. The Antarctic polar vortex was relatively cold and undisturbed during 2009, with an ozone hole similar to other recent undisturbed years (Section 2f3). TLS anomalies for 2009 (Plate 2.1) show large Arctic warming related to the January 2009 sudden stratospheric warming and a strong wave-1, or dipole pattern, in the zonal band around 60\u00b0S related to Antarctic changes in September-October. An increasing trend in this Antarctic pattern was noted in recent papers (Hu and Fu 2009;. As in previous years, changes in temperatures for altitudes above the lower stratosphere are difficult to characterize because of the relatively immature state of continuous datasets derived from the Stratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU), which ended in 2005, and the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), with several different instruments operational since 1998. c. Hydrological cycle 1) total column water vapor-C. Mears, J. Wang, S. Ho, L. Zhang, and X. Zhou Total column water vapor (TCWV) over the world's oceans has been monitored since the first Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) satellite in late 1987 (Wentz 1997). In this section, we use data from the SSM/I and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) instruments. Independent evaluations have found these data to be accurate enough for climate studies (Trenberth et al. 2005). Beginning in the late 1990s, ground-based GPS measurements provide a second accurate measurement of TCWV (Wang et al. 2007). Since these stations are often land based, they provide an important complement to the ocean-only SSM/I measurements. Even more recently, the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC, see sidebar) series of satellites have begun using satellite-to-satellite radio occultation (RO) measurements to make globally distributed measurements of water vapor profiles over land and ocean. Here COSMIC TCWV is calculated from corresponding water vapor profiles. The map of TCWV anomalies (Plate 2.1) includes data both from SSM/I (over the oceans) and from a subset of the ground-based GPS stations with continuous data from 1997 to 2009. This subset was chosen so that a meaningful anomaly estimate can be calculated-many more stations would be avail-    able if this requirement were relaxed since the size of the network is increasing rapidly with time. There is general agreement between the SSM/I and groundbased GPS measurements at locations where overlaps occur with differences typically less than 0.5 mm. In the latter half of the year, a large wet anomaly in the tropical Pacific was associated with the onset of El Ni\u00f1o conditions. In contrast, most regions outside the tropics were drier than normal. Changes in TCWV from 2008 to 2009 measured by three different measurement systems show the dramatic moistening of the tropical Pacific as the climate system shifted from strong La Ni\u00f1a conditions in 2008 to moderate El Ni\u00f1o conditions by the end of 2009 ( Fig. 2.10). The COSMIC measurements show this moistening extending across the Amazon basin, a region previously unobserved. SSM/I TCWV, from the world's ice-free oceans, shows maxima in 1987/88, 1997/98, 2002, 2006/07, and 2009 (/10), associated with ENSO events, with GPS data, only available since 1997, showing similar features (Fig. 2.11). An exact match is not expected since the two measurement systems sample different regions of the globe. The COSMIC data show the sharp increase from 2008 to 2009 seen in the other two datasets. The SSM/I data show an increasing trend in TCWV (0.27 mm per decade). In the tropics this increase has been formally attributed to anthropogenic change over the 1988-2006 period (Santer et al. 2007). A Hoffmueller plot derived from SSM/I (Fig. 2.12) shows that the increase is largest in the tropics and Northern Hemisphere and relatively small in the Southern Hemisphere.  (Vose et al. 1992). Two different historical comparisons of global landbased precipitation anomalies are also shown: beginning in 1901 using the difference between GPCC and GHCN, and beginning in 1979 using the difference between GPCP and GHCN (Schneider et al. 2008). All anomalies for the difference series were determined with respect to the 1981-2000 climatology. 2) Global precIpItatIon-D. H. Levinson, K. A. Hilburn, J. H. Lawrimore, and M. C. Kruk Global land precipitation estimates are derived from monthly totals of rain gauge measurements extending back at least to the beginning of the 20th century. In 2009 the positive anomaly continued an extended period of above average global precipitation covering the past five years (Fig. 2.13), and much of the period since 1996. Also shown (top curves) is the difference between global annual anomalies from three independent datasets (Global Historical Climatology Network [GHCN], Global Precipitation Climatology Centre [GPCC], and Global Precipitation Climatology Project [GPCP]). Overall, each of these datasets depict similar global anomalies on annual to interannual time scales, but some obvious differences occur on decadal timescales (e.g., during the early 1980s). Whether it is a gauge only (i.e., GHCN, GPCC) or a satellite-gauge blended product (i.e., GPCP), the gauge inventories used and the inclusion criteria applied to the analysis (i.e., percentage of data required during the base period), among other factors, lead to the observed differences in the annual anomalies over time. Over the global oceans, precipitation records are only available for the much shorter satellite era. Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) produces inter-calibrated passive microwave rain retrievals; which include retrievals from a total of eight microwave imagers into monthly-averaged maps at 2.5\u00b0 x 2.5\u00b0 resolution. For 2009, this included retrievals from TMI on TRMM, AMSR-E on Aqua, and F13 SSM/I on DMSP until it stopped functioning in late November 2009. There is substantial disagreement among three satellite-derived precipitation products over the ocean: RSS (Hilburn and Wentz 2008), Version 2.1 GPCP (Adler et al. 2003), and CMAP (Xie and Arkin 1997), especially during the first half of the time period (Fig. 2.14). RSS andGPCP trends for 1988-2008 were similar (19.5 \u00b1 7.7 mm year -1 decade -1 and 14.8 \u00b1 9.1 mm year -1 decade -1 , respectively; Levinson et al. 2009), but there are notable differences between the new version of GPCP and that used last year. However, in both versions there has been a relative drift compared to RSS since 2005. Based on updated analysis (Fig. 2.14), their 1988-2009 trends differ significantly and now exceed the 95% confidence interval. The RSS trend has not changed much, currently at 20.4 \u00b1 7.1 mm year -1 decade -1 , but the GPCP trend is much lower at 2.4 \u00b1 8.1 mm year -1 decade -1 . Fig. 2.14. Time series of precipitation anomalies relative to the period 1988-2009 for three datasets: RSS (black), GPCP (blue), and CMAP (red). Averages are for the global ocean equatorward of 60\u00b0 latitude using a common definition of \"ocean\". The annual cycle has been removed and the time series have been low-pass filtered by convolution with a Gaussian distribution, with 4-month width at half-peak power. RSS data are available through all of 2009, GPCP data are available through September 2009, and CMAP data are available through July 2008. The key gives the 1988-2009 mean (in units of mm year -1 ) and the linear trend (in units of mm year -1 decade -1 ) with the 95% confidence interval. The linear trends are shown by the straight lines. The confidence interval is estimated based on deviations from the linear fit, and does not represent a particular dataset's \"error\". Precipitation anomalies in 2009, over both land and ocean reflected the transition from La Ni\u00f1a at the end of 2008 to El Ni\u00f1o by late 2009. Over land, several regions experienced significant changes as a result. Long-term drought conditions in the southeastern United States persisted during the winter of 2008/09 (DJF; Fig. 2.15a), dissipated during the boreal spring (MAM; Fig. 2.15b), and were replaced by pronounced wet anomalies in the boreal fall as the El Ni\u00f1o developed (SON; Fig. 2.15d). Similarly, dry conditions that dominated northern Argentina for most of 2009 eventually broke later in the year as wet anomalies developed during the austral spring (SON; Fig. 2.15d). Abnormally dry conditions were also observed in southern Asia and the Indian subcontinent during the southwest monsoon (JJA; Fig. 2.15c). During the La Ni\u00f1a in early 2009, a dry anomaly covered the western and central Pacific, with a wet anomaly over the far western Pacific Ocean. As the equatorial Pacific basin transitioned from La Ni\u00f1a to El Ni\u00f1o, dry anomalies over the western equatorial Pacific expanded, as wet anomalies in the far western Pacific region weakened (Plate 2.1). Dry conditions were also observed over parts of the central southern Pacific and Indian Ocean basins. The most pronounced precipitation signal over the oceans was a dry anomaly over the tropical Atlantic along the climatological latitude of the ITCZ just north of the equator. This was in conjunction with a weaker wet anomaly just south of the equator indicating an anomalous southward excursion of the ITCZ. Precipitation anomalies over the tropical oceans were relatively weak compared to other years ( Fig. 2.16). In addition, the wetter-than-normal conditions over the Southern Ocean that started in 2000 continued through 2009. 3) northern hemIsphere contInental snow cover extent-D. A. Robinson Annual snow cover extent (SCE) over the Northern Hemisphere (including snow over the continents and the Greenland ice sheet) was 0.4 million km 2 less than the 40-yr average; 2009 experienced the 13th least extensive cover on record (Table 2.3). The SCE in 2009 ranged from 47.1 million km 2 in January to 2.4 million km 2 in August. 2009 began with SCE in the second highest quartile over Eurasia and North America. North A mer ica n ex tent remained within this quartile until April. However, Eurasian SCE fell into the lowest quartile in February where it remained until early fall. Being the larger of the two continents, this most often placed the hemispheric landmass into the lowest quartile until fall. SCE increased rapidly across both continents in early October, with Eurasia maintaining a top 10 ranking throughout the remainder of the year. North American SCE flipped from third most extensive in October to fourth least extensive in November and then to the most extensive of the satellite era in December. This exemplifies the significant intra-and inter-seasonal variability of continental snow extent, particularly during the fall season. Hemispheric SCE in December was the second greatest of the past 44 years, doubtless linked to the extreme negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation and associated circulation anomalies (Fig. 2.29). Late-year positive SCE anomalies resulted in the twelve-month running mean of Northern Hemisphere extent rising from its low extent of the past approximately two years and approaching the long-term mean (Fig. 2.17). Both hemispheric and Eurasian (Fig. 2.17) running means had not been as consistently low since the late 1980s and early 1990s. Meanwhile, the North American running mean remained close to the long-term mean throughout 2009.    (Fig. 2.18). The 1970s had the most extensive fall snow cover, with the 1980s the least extensive (approx -4% and the only decade below average). Winter SCE was almost equally above the 40-yr mean in the 1970s and 2000s, close to average in the 1980s, and below average in the 1990s. All winter decadal means were within 1.2% of average. Spring SCE steadily declined from the 1970s to 2000s, with these decades approximately +4% and -4% relative to the mean, respectively. 4) Global cloudIness-M. J. Foster, S. A. Ackerman, A. K. Heidinger, and B. C. Maddux Global cloud anomalies in 2009 reflected the shift from weak La Ni\u00f1a conditions to an El Ni\u00f1o during boreal summer. The resulting temperature and circulation anomalies enhanced large-scale convection in the central Pacific and suppressed convection in the western Pacific near Indonesia. This generated positive cloud anomalies in the central equatorial Pacific and corresponding negative anomalies around Indonesia in the latter half of the year. Large positive annual anomalies of 10% to 15% were seen off the western coast of Peru and eastern coasts of Australia and Papua New Guinea (Plate 2.1). Since the shift to El Ni\u00f1o conditions did not occur until boreal summer, the magnitudes of the annual cloud anomalies were relatively small. Only small portions of the anomaly off the west coast of Peru were statistically significant at the 5% level. 2009 also saw some unusual continental cloudiness with positive cloud anomalies over large portions of northwestern Africa coupled with negative anomalies over eastern Africa (Plate 2.1), sustained throughout much of the year. Parts of Brazil also maintained positive cloud anomalies for much of 2009 and an interesting though shortlived cloudiness event occurred over the continental United States. Large positive anomalies over most of North America in October 2009 (Fig. 2.19) coincided with the wettest October since records began in 1894. Portions of the Midwest cloudiness anomalies are statistically significant at the 5% level. Global mean monthly cloud anomalies from four different satellite cloud climatologies and surface observations (Fig. 2.20) are defined as each month minus its corresponding time series monthly mean. Differences in cloudiness estimates can in part be attributed to variations in how cloud-masking algorithms define cloud versus clear-sky thresholds. This is in addition to correcting for factors such as sensor viewing angle, pixel footprint size, spectral channels, diurnal satellite drift, and sensor calibration. The trend of cloud anomalies over the last four decades is smaller than seasonal and diurnal variability and within the range of estimated uncertainties for each product. With that in mind t-values are calculated for the slope of each month to remove seasonal effects: the surface weather observations (Fig. 2.20) data record shows a positive trend for all months while the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP, Fig. 2.20) record shows a negative trend. None of the other records show significant trends. Relative to the entire Pathfinder Atmospheres Extended (PATMOS-x, Fig. 2.20) time series, 2009 was slightly cloudier-than-normal. The mean cloudiness for the year was 65.6%, 0.3% higher than the 28-year average, making 2009 the ninth cloudiest of the time series. Nine months had higher cloudiness than the monthly mean (not significant), with only April, May, and August falling below the mean. 5) rIver dIscharGe-B. M. Fekete, R. B. Lammers, A. Mac-Donald, L. C. Bowling, and R. Lawford Discharge gauges are efficient and relatively inexpensive, and river discharge is the most accurately measured component of the water cycle (Fekete et al. 2002;Hagemann and D\u00fcmenil 1998). While modern telecommunication technologies are readily available to share in situ observations in a timely manner, the lack of international cooperation and data sharing are the main obstacles in accessing discharge data. For this reason historical runoff analyses are always delayed by three to five years and are incomplete in important geographical areas. As few as ~300 discharge gauges, strategically located near river mouths of large rivers around the world, could monitor over 50% of the continental land mass (Fekete et al. 2002). The World Meteorological Organization is proposing to establish 265 real-time reporting discharge gauges globally (to monitor 40% of the continental land mass) as the number of operating discharge gauges has steadily declined since the mid-1980s (Shiklomanov et al. 2002;V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty et al. 2002) at the same time as concerns about climate change effects are growing. The only way to reconstruct recent changes in global runoff is to carry out water balance calculations using a relatively simple configuration of the Water Balance Model driven by observed air temperatures and precipitation (V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty et al. 1998;Wisser et al. 2008Wisser et al. , 2010. Water balance calculations were carried out for the periods of 1901-2002, 1948-2007, 1986-2008, and 2003-05 using combinations of different climate forcings (due to the lack of single consistent time series from the beginning of the 20th Century to present). The overlapping periods were used to reconcile the different runoff estimates. The reconciled runoff estimates ( Fig. 2.21/Plate 2.1) reveal that the last decade (2000-09) had similar or increased river discharge in all continents and ocean catchments, except Africa and the Mediterranean/Black Sea drainage when compared to the long-term mean. 2009 appeared to return to the 20th Century global average except over Africa, the Pacific Islands, South America, and the Arctic and Pacific Oceans. Most of the continents show similar patterns except Africa, which is drying steadily and Asia, which fell below the 20th Century average in 2009.  Global Positioning System (GPS) Radio Occultation (RO) data are an important component of the evolving global observing system (NRC 20 07; WMO 20 07; GCOS 2004). GPS-RO is the only self-calibrated observing technique from space whereby its fundamental measurement is traceable to the international system of units (SI) (SI traceability; Ohring 2007). GPS receivers on low-Earth orbiting (LEO) satellites receive measurable radio frequency signals transmitted from GPS satellites; monitoring and corrections from a series of atomic clocks allows the signal timing to be traced to the SI second with a high degree of accuracy. Significant advantages of SI-traceable GPS-RO observations for climate monitoring include: (i) no satellite-to-satellite bias (Hajj et al. 2004;Ho et al. 2009a); (ii) great precision (Anthes et al. 2008;Foelsche et al. 2009;Ho et al. 2009a); and (iii) no synoptic sampling bias (cloud/precipitation effects). Raw RO observations and precise positions and velocities of GPS and LEO satellites, can be used to derive atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles (Hajj et al. 2004;Kuo et al. 2004;Ho et al. 2009b). GPS-RO temperature can be validated by comparing temperature measurements from FORMOSAT-3/ COSMIC with high quality radiosonde measurements. With a uniform distribution of COSMIC RO data in time and space (~2500 profiles per day, Fig. 2.22), more than 10 000 collocations of Vaisala-RS92 radiosonde and COSMIC data within 2 hours and 300 km exist (Fig. 2.23). The precision of COSMIC derived temperature profiles is estimated to be better than 0.05 K from 8 km to 30 km (Ho et al. 2009a); COSMIC temperature is very close to radiosondes from 200 hPa to 20 hPa (around 12 km to 25 km). Because the quality of RO data does not vary with location and time, it is very useful for assessing systematic errors in different radiosonde sensors (e.g., He et al. 2009;Kuo et al. 2005;Elliott and Gaffen 1991;Luers and Eskridge 1998). Radiative temperature biases that vary during the day and night can be identified for different radiosonde sensor types when comparing with collocated COSMIC RO soundings (He et al. 2009). The upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UT/LS) is a critical region for understanding the radiative balance of the climate system and climate processes. However, due to poor vertical resolution and/or fundamental measurement uncertainty, most in situ and satellite sounder measurements of meteorological parameters in this region are not suitable for climate monitoring (Karl et al. 2006). The very high precision and vertical resolution (from ~60 m near the surface to ~1.5 km at 40 km) of GPS-RO data makes them very suitable to detect changes in UT/LS temperature (Ho et al. 2007), tropopause height, and the distribution of double tropopauses (Randel et al. 2007). Because GPS-RO data are not affected by on-orbit heating and cooling of satellite components, they are very useful for identifying the time/location dependent biases of microwave sounders (Ho et al. 2009c), making them potentially useful as a climate benchmark (Ho et al. 2009a) in addition to being well suited to detect climate trends (Ho et al. 2009b;Ringer and Healy 2008). Using refractivity data and reasonably independent temperature profiles, highly precise COSMIC water vapor profiles can be derived. Comparisons of total-column water vapor (TCWV) from COSMIC with those derived from ground-based GPS (i.e., International Global Navigation Satellite Systems-IGS, Wang et al. 2007) show that the mean global difference between IGS and COSMIC TCWV is about -0.2 mm with a standard deviation of 2.7 mm (Fig. 2.24)."}, {"section_title": "Fig. 2.26. Locations of lakes and reservoirs for which", "text": "near-real-time lake level products are or will be available through the NASA/USDA/FAS Web site. 6) lake levels-C. Birkett Lake volumes respond to changes in precipitation integrated over their catchment basins (Street-Perrott et al. 1986) and are indirect indicators of climatic change (Langbein 1961;Szesztay 1974). The response is particularly marked for closed lakes (having no significant surface or subsurface outf low) whose surface area, when in hydrological equilibrium, has been used in paleoclimatic studies to indicate changes in aridity. Closed lakes act as low-pass filters to variations in aridity, with a characteristic time constant of between 1 and 1000 years, depending largely on lake geomorphology (Mason et al. 1994). Historical studies of the links between climate and lake levels have concentrated on individual lakes or regions. However, both natural and anthropogenic climate effects have highlighted the need for a global approach to the systematic monitoring of lake levels (Williams 1993). For many lakes ground-based lake levels ('stage') can be difficult to acquire, and while satellite-based imagery can reveal surface extent, there are currently no operational products. Satellite-based lake-level products, however, are now being offered within three programs (NASA/ USDA,ESA,and LEGOS;Fig. 2.25). Records are now long enough in theory to support climate monitoring. Large-lake levels are derived using several satellite radar altimeters with varying temporal (10-, 17-, 35day) and spatial resolutions. Errors relative to groundbased gauge data can range from a few centimeters to tens of centimeters RMS (Birkett 1995). The NASA/ CNES suite of instruments offers measurements from 1992, the ESA suite from 1994. The number of lakes considered varies within each program but Fig. 2.26 shows the potential spatial distribution of all lake products within the NASA/USDA program. Location and lake type information can also be found in the databases of Birkett and Mason (1995, lakes of surface area \u2265 100 km 2 ) and Lehner and D\u00f6ll (2004, surface areas \u2265 50 km 2 ). While the NASA/USDA program provides a graphic comparison of the near-real-time water level status with respect to a short-term mean (Fig. 2.27), published research has focused more on single basin studies or regional water level variations and their links to ENSO and Indian Ocean SST anomalies (Birkett et al. 1999;Arpe et al. 2000;Mercier et al. 2002;Bergonzini et al. 2004;Zola and Bengtsson 2006;Ricko et al. 2009, manuscript submitted to J. Climate). Although the focus in these studies is on larger, open lakes (having significant surface or subsurface outflow), the ability of these phenomena to gain a rapid reaction in lake level regardless of anthropogenic controls shows that global and regional studies should not exclude other lake types and reservoirs.

Allan As highlighted in previous sections, a weak-moderate El Ni\u00f1o event developed mid-2009 following the collapse of La Ni\u00f1a early in the year. As a consequence, the annual global MSLP field showed no distinct El Ni\u00f1o signature (Plate 2.1). El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events can be measured by the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), the normalized MSLP difference between Tahiti and Darwin (Allan et al. 1996). El Ni\u00f1os (negative SOI) and La Ni\u00f1as (positive SOI) vary in magnitude, duration, and evolution, with no two events or episodes exactly the same. The SOI since 1900 is dominated by interannual to multidecadal vacillations, but very long-term trends are not evident (Fig. 2.28a). The SOI trace since 2000 highlights the shift from the La Ni\u00f1a of 2007/08 to the El Ni\u00f1o of 2009 ( Fig. 2.28b). Major El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events can be near-global in their influence on world weather patterns, owing to ocean-atmosphere interactions across the Indo-Pacific region with tele-connections to higher latitudes in both hemispheres. The other major event in 2009 was the development of an extreme negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)/Arctic Oscillation (AO) phase in December 2009 that persisted through much of the 2009/10 winter. In Fig. 2.29, the December 2009 global MSLP field distinctly shows the NAO/AO inf luence across the North Atlantic and North Pacific with positive pressure anomalies over higher latitudes and negative anomalies over the mid-latitudes and an associated reduction in westerlies. This is further evident in Fig. 2.30a which highlights the major shift in atmospheric circulation in early December 2009 which led to record snow and cold temperatures across the UK and parts of Europe and North America. Monthly AO values since 1950 (Fig. 2.30b) indicate that the December 2009 value was the lowest December value in that record. 2) surface wInd speed-C. Mears Surface wind speed over the world's oceans began to be monitored continuously with  the launch of the first Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) satellite in late 1987. The SSM/I instrument is a microwave radiometer that makes measurements of upwelling microwave radiation to infer the surface roughness of the worlds oceans and thus, the surface wind speed (Wentz 1997). Since the first SSM/I instrument, a number of additional microwave imaging sensors have been launched and intercalibrated to the accuracy necessary for climate studies (Wentz et al. 2007). Globallyaveraged winds (Fig. 2.31) exhibited a maximum in 1988/89, followed by a minimum in 1991, and then an increasing trend in global winds from 1990from to 2007from . In 2008from and 2009, global wind speed fell slightly. Wind speeds derived from the QuikSCAT microwave scatterometer (Lungu and Callahan 2006), carried on a different satellite than the SSM/I instrument, using a different measurement technology show nearly identical results. Surface wind speed is dominated by short-term variability making it difficult to discern long-term trend behavior."}, {"section_title": "S40", "text": "Winds in the tropics, especially the central tropical Pacific, were sharply reduced during 2009 (Fig. 2.32,Fig. 2.33), as the tropical pacific transitioned to El Ni\u00f1o.

Stackhouse, Jr., T. Wong, n. G. Loeb, D. P. Kratz, A. C. Wilber, D. R. Doelling, and L. C. nguyen Preliminary analysis suggests that both the globalannual mean outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and the reflected shortwave radiation increased slightly by ~0.1 W m -2 , from 2008 to 2009 (Table 2.4). There was very little annual average change in the total solar irradiance (< 0.01 W m -2 ) since the solar activity remained at minimum during the period. Thus, the combined longwave and shortwave changes caused a reduction of ~0.2 W m -2 in total net radiation into the Earth climate system in 2009. These initial results derived from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES; Wielicki et al. 1998) Fast Longwave and Shortwave Radiative Fluxes (FLASHFlux) dataset (Stackhouse et al. 2006;L'Ecuyer et al. 2008) may still include small instrument drift artifacts between January 2008 and December 2009. Reassessments of these results are expected in the forthcoming CERES Edition 3 instrument calibration data and after CE-RES FLASHFlux is upgraded to provide global gridded monthly anomaly information. Relative to the multiyear dataset average for 2001 to 2008, the 2009 globalannual mean anomaly (Table  2.4) is -0.4/0.0/+0.4 W m -2 for longwave/shortwave/total net radiation, respectively. These are within their corresponding 2-sigma interannual variabilities for this period. Global monthly deseasonalized anomalies since March 2000 have been constructed by merging Earth Radiation Budget (ERB) datasets from two sources: a new CERES SSF (Single Scanning Footprint) 1x1 Degree Lite (SSF 1Deg Lite; a Top-of-Atmosphere [TOA] only version) using the Edition 2.5 instrument calibration; and CERES FLASHFlux (Fig. 2.34). TOA Fluxes from both datasets in the year 2007 were used to normalize the FLASHFlux data to SSF 1Deg Lite. The 2-sigma monthly uncertainty from the overlapped period is \u00b10.4/\u00b10.9/\u00b11.3 W m -2 for the longwave/shortwave/net radiation, respectively. By mid-2009, the decrease in the OLR and the increase in the total net TOA flux continuing from late 2008 peaked and then reversed sign. Smoothed averaged TOA OLR shows a general agreement in fluctuations with a similarly smoothed Multivariate ENSO Index where the index peaked negatively in late 2008/early 2009 and reversed sign during the year. Thus, it appears that change in El Ni\u00f1o intensity is largely responsible for the global averaged monthly TOA variability during this time period. Linear trend analyses are not recommended due to the natural fluctuation in ERB relating to ENSO activity in the short record, large uncertainty from the data merging process, and instrument drift potential in the FLASHFlux data. A long-term homogeneous data source with in-depth instrument stability analysis is needed to reduce these uncertainties for future reassessment activity."}, {"section_title": "f.

Atmospheric CO 2 has increased from about 280 ppm at the start of the industrial revolution to more than 380 ppm today. About half of the emitted CO 2 remains in the atmosphere after a year, and after a millennium, ~20% remains (Archer and Brovkin 2008). The preliminary globally averaged atmospheric CO 2 mole fraction in 2009 was 386.29 ppm; 1.5 ppm more than 2008 [see Conway et al. (1994) for a description of sampling network and methods]. This is slightly greater than the average rate of increase from 1979 through 2008 of 1.63 ppm yr -1 . Despite fossil CO 2 emissions being predominantly in the northern hemisphere, the rate of increase of atmospheric CO 2 is approximately geographically uniform (Fig. 2.35).

The current atmospheric CH 4 observing network, including in situ and remotely-sensed observations, is insufficient to determine with certainty the causes of CH 4 increases over the past three years (see Fig. 2.35).

These anomalies are likely the result of tropical (Langenfelds et al. 2002) and boreal biomass burning (Kasischke et al. 2000). Since the lifetime of CO is relatively short (few months), the CO enhancements quickly disappeared. The preliminary globally averaged CO mole fraction in 2009 is 80 ppb, 15 ppb lower than 1998. ESRL's surface sampling network is less sensitive to biomass burning emissions of CO than remotely sensed CO observations, such as MOPITT (Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere; Pan et al. 1998), because emissions are rapidly transported away from the surface where the sampling sites are. The combination of surface measurements and MOPITT retrievals provide useful auxiliary information in determining the contribution of biomass burning to recent increases in atmospheric CH 4 (see Fig. 2.35)."}, {"section_title": "(ii) Changes in atmospheric abundances", "text": "of ozone-depleting gases and their replacements-S. A. Montzka and G. S. Dutton Long-lived halocarbons affect the radiative balance of the atmosphere because they efficiently absorb terrestrial infrared (IR) radiation. Those containing bromine (Br) and chlorine (Cl) also influence the radiative atmospheric balance indirectly through their destruction of stratospheric ozone. Through amendments and adjustments to the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, the decline in mixing ratios of most of the potent ozone-depleting gases continued in 2009 ( Fig. 2.36). However, mixing ratios of some halogenated gases continue to increase globally. The most rapid increases are observed for hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), common replacements for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons, and other ozone-depleting gases. Increases in HCFCs have recently accelerated owing to enhanced use in developing countries (Montzka et al. 2009). Both HCFCs and HFCs are efficient absorbers of infrared radiation (Table 2.5). HCFCs contain chlorine but have smaller influence on ozone than the CFCs; HFCs do not cause ozone destruction. The inf luence of halocarbon trace-gas trends on future levels of stratospheric ozone can be estimated from weighted sums of Cl and Br in long- Fig. 2.36.

The bottom panel shows the recent changes in Effective Equivalent Stratospheric Chlorine (EESC) observed by the NOAA/GMD global network relative to the secular changes observed in the past, including the level observed in 1980 when the ozone hole was first observed, and a projected future. The Ozone Depleting Gas Index for midlatitudes is derived (right-hand axis) from rescaling EESC. EESC is derived from EECl by simply adding 3 years to the time axis to represent the lag associated with mixing air from the troposphere to the middle stratosphere, where the ozone layer resides [Source: updates to Montzka et al.

It provides an estimate of the nearfuture ozone-depleting power of trace gases (EESC,Fig. 2.36), when air at the Earth's surface will have become mixed into the midlatitude stratosphere. A second metric, equivalent chlorine (ECl, not shown), provides an estimate of the ozone-depleting power of trace gases in the near future for the stratosphere over the Polar Regions. The EECl content of the lower atmosphere has declined fairly steadily since the peak in 1994 through 2009 at a mean rate of 28 ppt yr -1 . Despite these substantial changes, full recovery of stratospheric ozone is not expected until the middle to latter part of the 21st century owing to the long lifetime of many of these chemicals (lower panel of Fig. 2.36;Table 2.5). Progress towards EECl reductions can now be readily assessed with the NOAA Ozone-Depleting Gas Index (ODGI) (Hofmann and Montzka 2009). In 2009 the ODGI for the midlatitudes was 68.7 and the ODGI for Antarctica derived from ECl estimates was 83.5 (not shown)."}, {"section_title": "(iii) The combined influence of long-lived trace gases", "text": "on the radiative balance of the atmosphere-S. A. Montzka Long-lived trace gases have a direct and indirect influence on the energy balance of the atmosphere. The direct radiative influence of a trace gas is proportional to its atmospheric abundance and its radiative efficiency (Table 2.5). High precision measurements of the major long-lived greenhouse gases and 15 minor greenhouse gases (Table 2.5) have been used to calculate the overall change in the direct radiative climate forcing (Hofmann et al. 2006) (Fig. 2.37). By mid-2008, the increases in the abundances of all these gases amounted to an additional direct radiative forcing to the atmosphere totaling approximately 2.74 W m -2 , changes in the abundance of CO 2 accounting for 63% of this enhanced radiative forcing. The NOAA Annual Greenhouse Gas Index (AGGI) (Hofmann et al. 2006) is calculated as a ratio relative to the direct radiative forcing calculated from these gases for 1990; indirect effects (e.g., arising from ozone depletion or water-vapor feedbacks) are not considered. Preliminary data indicated that the 2009 AGGI was 1.275 (Fig. 2.37) and CO 2 had accounted for about 80% of the observed increase since 1990. (iv) Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 )-J. W. Elkins and G. S. Dutton Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) are important atmospheric trace gases with significant man-made sources. Nitrous oxide has the third strongest anthropogenic climate forcing after CO 2 and CH 4 and is considered a major greenhouse gas (Butler 2009). Atmospheric N 2 O is also responsible for stratospheric ozone depletion by providing a source of stratospheric nitric oxide (Ravishankara et al. 2009). The 2009 mean global concentration of N 2 O was 322.5 \u00b1 0.1 ppb yr -1 (Fig. 2.38, top panel). Its mean global growth rate since 1977 is 0.733 \u00b1 0.002 ppb but with substantial interannual variation (Fig. 2.38,bottom panel). The atmospheric N 2 O budget is out of balance by one-third as a result of man-made emissions, primarily through emissions from nitrogen fertilizers (Crutzen et al. 2007). Sulfur hexafluoride has one of the strongest Global Warming Potentials (GWP) of all trace gases at 23 900 times CO 2 with a 100-yr time horizon (Solomon et al. 2007) with the fifth strongest climate forcing of the 10 minor greenhouse gases (Hofmann et al. 2006). Its global average concentration for 2009 was 6.76 \u00b1 0.07 parts-per-trillion dry by mole fraction (ppt) (Fig. 2.38, top panel) and thus its climate forcing contribution is small. The atmospheric lifetime of SF 6 is long (3200 yr); so, many developed countries have instituted voluntary programs with suppliers and utilities to reduce their emissions. The global atmospheric growth rate peaked at 0.32 ppt yr -1 in 2008 but in 2009 decreased, perhaps as a result of the recent global economic recession and voluntary efforts by countries to reduce emissions ( Fig. 2.38, bottom panel).  NA = Not applicable; the lifetime of CO 2 cannot be expressed as a single number (Archer and Brovkin 2008). * Radiative forcings and lifetimes are taken from Daniel et al.

Changes indicated in brackets are simply the difference between the 2009 and 2008 annual global surface mean mixing ratios. Units are ppm for CO 2 , ppb for CH 4 and N 2 O, and ppt for all others. 2) Global aerosols-J.W. Kaiser, A. Benedetti, and J.-J. Morcrette Atmospheric aerosols influence atmospheric radiation and cloud droplet nucleation. Inadequate understanding of these direct and indirect effects dominates uncertainty of the radiative forcing in climate projections from climate models (Alley et al. 2007). The aerosol sources are influ-enced by changes in land cover, wind and precipitation patterns, and human activities. Global monitoring of aerosols remains a substantial scientific challenge due to their large variability and heterogeneity in chemical composition and size. Current routine ground-and satellite-based observations of aerosols cannot provide high temporal resolution global coverage and yield only very limited information on the chemical composition, size distribution, and vertical profiles. The Global and regional Earth-system Monitoring using Satellite and in-situ data project (GEMS, Hollingsworth et al. 2008) has created a continuous space-time representation of the global aerosol distribution since 2003. It assimilates 550 nm aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) into ECMWF's numerical weather prediction model extended to include the sources, sinks, and transport and conversion processes of several aerosol species (Benedetti et al. 2009;Morcrette et al. 2009). Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC), the follow-up project of GEMS, is currently producing real-time aerosol analyses and forecasts and a new reanalysis starting in 2003, both with improved model, emission inventories and data assimilation system. Total AOD is strongly constrained by observations over ocean but over land, the total AOD information is a mix from observations and model. Total AOD at high latitudes and the relative distribution between the aerosol species at all latitudes come largely from the model. On a global scale, the aerosol distribution up to September 2009 appears to have been in line with previous years back to 2003 (Fig. 2.39). The largest contribution to AOD comes from organic matter, closely followed by sea salt, then dust and sulfate. Dust aerosols have a fairly regular annual cycle with a maximum in the Northern Hemisphere summer. Organic matter varies with a higher frequency and more variability, but less amplitude than dust. Sea salt and black carbon exhibit little variability. Sea salt aerosols are associated with storms, particularly in the Southern Ocean (Fig. 2.40). Dust is lifted by strong winds from bare soils and deserts; the Sahara, with its dust outflow over the Atlantic, is most pronounced. Organic matter and black carbon are dominantly produced by biomass burning at lowlatitudes and to a lesser degree in boreal forests. Even though black carbon has a relatively low AOD, as the most absorbing aerosol type, it has a large impact on atmospheric radiation. The distribution of sulfate aerosols reflects the anthropogenic emission inventory that was used in the model with rather localized sources in North America, Europe, India, and China. 3) stratospherIc ozone-M.

Steinbrecht The 2009 annual mean anomaly of total column ozone was generally positive (compared to the 1996 to  (Thoning et al. 1989) with a two year filter, note the rise of the atmospheric SF 6 growth rate after 2003.

As for", "text": "2009 climatological mean) except for a narrow band in the tropics, a small region over the North Pacific, and above Antarctica (Plate 2.1). Maximum positive anomalies of up to about 20 Dobson Units (DU) occurred at northern mid-to high latitudes, from the North Atlantic to Russia. Positive anomalies were also observed at similar latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. The largest year-to-year variability is normally observed during winter/spring in each hemisphere. In February and March 2009 positive anomalies of over 50 DU were observed over Europe and Russia and much of the north polar region. However, a region above the Aleutian peninsula, characterized by the Aleutian high, associated with a high tropopause and dynamically reduced column ozone, experienced a -25 DU anomaly. During Arctic winter an unusually large sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) event occurred in January 2009 ( Fig.  2.9), contributing to a weaker than usual Arctic vortex and increased ozone transport into high latitudes (Labitzke and Kunze 2009). Negative anomalies were observed in the tropics within a narrow 20\u00b0 latitude band around the equator. Interannual modulation of tropical stratospheric ozone is dominated by the QBO (see Section 2b4; Baldwin et al. 2001). During 2009, the QBO phase (stratospheric equatorial winds near 50 hPa) changed from west to east. This led to negative total ozone anomalies in the second half of 2009. The QBO has a periodic signature in tropical (and extratropical) total ozone (Fig. 2.41). Plate 2.1 and Fig. 2.41 show that the 2009 Antarctic ozone hole was slightly larger than the long-term mean, comparable to 2007, but not as large as in 2008, or in the record year of 2006. The trend in the global annual mean total ozone (Fig. 2.42a) has its main contribution from changes at midlatitudes in both hemispheres (Fig. 2.42b,d), while tropical ozone (Fig. 2.42c) does not show a significant trend. The long-term decrease starting in the 1970s slowed by the mid-1990s and has since leveled off in the extratropics. The substantial minimum in the Northern Hemisphere in the mid-1990s is due to intensification of the chlorine induced ozone decline by the Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption and by a series of unusually cold Arctic winters with reduced ozone transport and high polar ozone loss (Dhomse et al. 2006). It is expected that total ozone should recover since stratospheric halogen has levelled off and is now declining (Section 2f1ii). However, other factors, e.g., changes in the Brewer-Dobson circulation, annular modes of internal variability, or the 11-year solar cycle also contribute to decadal changes (Appenzeller et al.

Also, atmospheric transports play a lesser role. Ozone in the upper stratosphere declined substantially, by 10% to 15%, from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s but has since levelled off (Fig. 2.43). In the last 10 years, the various records show signs of an increase (Steinbrecht et al. 2009;. This long-term behavior of ozone in the upper stratosphere is in agreement with the earlier large increase and subsequent decline of the stratospheric halogen load (Fig. 2.36). Superimposed are quasi-  biennial and decadal ozone variations, which follow the QBO and the 11-year solar cycle. In late 2009, the QBO phase (beginning westerly at 10 hPa, easterly at 50 hPa, see section 2b4) and the continuing solar minimum both contributed to low levels of upperstratospheric ozone.

Land surface properties", "text": "1) alpIne GlacIers and Ice sheets-M. S. Pelto The World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS) records of mass balance (difference between accumulation and ablation) and terminus behavior (WGMS 2009;WGMS 2008) provide global indices of alpine glacier behavior. Mass balance was negative in 2008 for the 18th consecutive year. Preliminary 2009 data from Austria, Norway, New Zealand, and the United States indicate it is highly likely that it was the 19th consecutive year of negative annual balances. The worldwide retreat of mountain glaciers is one of the clearest signals of ongoing climate change (Haeberli and Hoelzel 1995). Alpine glaciers have been studied for more than a century (Oerlemans 1994). The retreat of their termini is a reflection of strongly negative mass balances over the last 30 years (WGMS 2007) which when combined with recent rapid retreat has led to some glaciers disappearing (Pelto 2010). The cumulative loss of the last 30 years averaged across 30 WGMS reference glaciers is 11.6 m water equivalent (w.e.), equivalent to slicing 13 m off the top of the average glacier ( Fig. 2.44). The decadal mean annual mass balance was -198 mm in the 1980s, -382 mm in the 1990s, and -624 mm for 2000-08 ( Fig.   2.45). The declining trend is remarkably consistent from region to region (WGMS 2009). A glacier with a sustained negative balance will retreat. Glacier retreat primarily results in the loss of the low-elevation region of a glacier; this potentially reduces total ablation, increases mass balance, and reestablishes equilibrium. Currently, despite sustained negative mass balance and significant glacier retreat, alpine glaciers are not approaching equilibrium. If a glacier experiences significant thinning in the upper regions during this retreat this is symptomatic of not having a sufficient accumulation zone to survive the current climate (Pelto 2010;Paul et al. 2007). Of 93 Austrian glaciers surveyed in 2009, 85 receded, 7 were stationary, and 1 advanced with a mean terminus change rate of -14.3 m, slightly higher than in 2008. Winter accumulation on Austrian glaciers was about average and summer loss was above average due to higher than normal summer temperatures. The mass balance loss was larger than the decadal mean 1998-2008; Hintereisferner -1182 mm w.e., Kesselwandferner -795 mm w.e., and Jamtalferner -953 mm w.e. (A. Fischer, personal communication). Over Switzerland 81 of the 88 glaciers examined retreated, 2 advanced, and 5 were stable in 2009. Overall mass balance was negative (Swiss Glacier Monitoring, personal communication). Preliminary 2009 results indicate normal accumulation and ablation for Norway (L. Andreasson, personal communication). Terminus fluctuation data from 27 glaciers indicates 22 retreating, 3 stable, and 2 advancing with average terminus change of -18 m, compared to -13 m in 2008.

In New Zealand, glaciers shrank between April 2008 and March 2009 owing to above normal temperatures and below normal rainfall in both winter and summer (J. Hendrikx, personal communication). On 50 glaciers surveyed the average snow line was 95 m above the equilibrium snow line elevation, the sixth highest in the 33 year record. Negative anomalies in melting days occurred in 2009 in South and West Greenland, and positive anomalies in North and East Greenland as derived from SSM/I brightness temperatures relative to the 1979-2008 average (Tedesco et al. 2008 FAPAR is largely controlled by Leaf Area Index (which controls attenuation of radiation) and to a lesser extent by the absorption efficiency of the vegetation ele- ments composing the canopy and the soil background brightness (through backscattering processes). In Plate 2.1 the strongest positive anomalies for 2009, indicating favorable vegetation growing conditions, are found in eastern Brazil (Cerrado and Mid-Atlantic coastal region) and South Africa, while most of the rest of South America and east Africa exhibit the strongest negative anomalies. Persistent droughts in Southern America, East Africa, and Australia (WMO 2010) are clearly manifest in poor vegetation growth and vigor. The profound nature of the impact of these droughts is further illustrated in Fig. 2.46, which provides a seasonal breakdown. Figure 2.46 illustrates how the Southern Hemisphere contrasts sharply with the Northern Hemisphere-negative anomalies persist through all seasons in the south, while the north (especially central North America and western Europe) fluctuates between the two states. Pronounced positive anomalies of eastern Brazil are mainly due to FAPAR changes in the Southern Hemisphere winter and spring, i.e., the local dry season. The weaker positive anomaly in southern Africa and the strong negative anomaly in southeastern South America are manifest mainly during December 2008-February 2009. This period was characterized by moderate La Ni\u00f1a conditions. Southern Africa (South Africa, Botswana, and Namibia) exhibits statistically significant negative correlations between SOI (which is positive during La Ni\u00f1a) and observed precipitation, while no known significant teleconnection exists between ENSO and the South American region (van Oldenborgh and Burgers 2005).  Figure 2.47 suggests the presence of a negative trend occurring over the latitude band 30\u00b0S to 50\u00b0S. This is apparent in the globally averaged time series (Fig. 2.48) and strong enough to yield global monthly negative anomalies for the most recent years. These negative anomalies have been continuous since 2007 reaching a minimum in May 2009. FAPAR is related to CO 2 assimilation by plants. The negative tendency since records began in 1998 indicates that the efficiency of CO 2 assimilation, at least as monitored through the FAPAR proxy of photosynthetic rate, does indeed appear to be declining (Knorr et al. 2007). Both Figs. 2.47 and 2.48 also show that this trend is not merely a result of an anomalous year in 1998. Instead, after the period of FAPAR decline in 2000-03 noted by Knorr et al. (2007), we find another period of similar decline since 2007, interrupted by only a moderate recovery during 2004-07. 3) bIomass burnInG-J. W. Kaiser and J. G. Goldammer Vegetation fires (burning of live and dead biomass) and their impacts are influenced by complex interactions between biosphere, humans, and climate (e.g., Bowman et al. 2009). Size, intensity and severity of fires respond to changes of weather and climate (interannual climate variability and long-term climate change). The resulting carbon emissions, e.g., 2.0 Pg C year -1 -3.2 Pg C year -1 in 1997(van der Werf et al. 2006, can amount to almost half those from fossil fuels, i.e., 7.2 Pg C year -1 in 2000-05 (Alley et al. 2007). Therefore, fire must be included in any quantitative model of the global carbon cycle. In ecosystems where regular fires are part of the natural cycle, the released carbon is taken up again by regrowth. If fires result in permanent deforestation or vegetation degradation, on the other hand, carbon stocks may be depleted irreversibly (Fargione et al. 2008). The emitted carbon monoxide and ozone also significantly increase the radiative forcing, while the net effect of the resulting changes in surface albedo reduces it (Bowman et al. 2009). The indirect effect of smoke aerosols is still poorly understood. The GEMS project and its follow-up MACC (Hollingsworth et al. 2008) derive retrospective and real-time biomass burning emissions from satellitebased observations of Fire Radiative Power (FRP). This is approximately proportional to the biomass combustion rate for open fires (Wooster et al. 2005). Figure 2.49 shows FRP averaged over 2003-08 (a) and for 2009 (b), with five-degree resolution. These are derived from the FRP products of the two MODIS sensors using a cloud cover correction at a resolution  "}, {"section_title": "S52", "text": "JULY 2010 | of 0.1\u00b0 and 5 days (Kaiser et al. 2009). Validation of the data is still ongoing. The climatology displays the main burning seasons in Sub-Saharan and Southern Hemispheric Africa, South America, the South-East Asian peninsula, and Australia. Boreal forest fires are only of secondary importance for the global budget. Peat forest fires on South-East Asian islands and understory ground fires are expected to be underrepresented because they are not fully visible from space. Fires detected around the Persian Gulf are f lares from oil production instead of biomass burning (cf. Schultz 2002). Globally, the biomass burning rate of 2009 was the lowest in the short record. Two-thirds of the global reduction has taken place in South America, where Brazil has drastically reduced the deforestation in the Amazon basin ( Fig. 2.49/Plate 2.1: see also http:// www.obt.inpe.br/prodes/prodes_1988_2009.htm). On-site field exploration by the Global Fire Monitoring Center (GFMC) in the Russian Federation also revealed a significant decrease of wildfires in 2009 as compared to the early 2000s due to prevailing moist weather conditions (http://www.fire.uni-freiburg.de/ GFMCnew/2009/10/1014/20091014_ru.htm). Global and regional budgets of FRP are listed in Table 2.6. The unique features in the global SST in 2009 include (1) the development of the 2009/10 El Ni\u00f1o in the tropical Pacific, (2) the transition of the PDO from a 2-year persistent negative phase to a positive phase during the fall/winter 2009, (3) a significant warming in the tropical Indian Ocean, and (4) a substantial cooling in the mid-latitude North Atlan- tic. We used the Optimal Interpolation SST version 2 (OISST v.2), which is a weekly analysis on a onedegree grid derived by combining in situ and satellite observations for the period of November 1981 to present (Reynolds et al. 2002). To put the 2009 SST in a historical perspective, we also analyzed the Extended Reconstructed SST version 3b (ERSST.v3b), which is a monthly merged land-ocean surface temperature analysis on a two-degree grid for the period of 1854 to present . SST anomalies (SSTA) are defined as departures from the 1971 to 2000 climatology described by Xue et al. (2003). The yearly mean SSTA in 2009 is characterized by overall positive SSTA in all the tropical oceans, and negative SSTA south of 40\u00b0S. The 2009 SSTA has a negative PDO pattern in the North Pacific, and a tripole pattern in the North Atlantic ( Fig. 3.1a). The 2009 minus 2008 SSTA differences show signatures of the development of the 2009/10 El Ni\u00f1o and the transition of the PDO from a negative to positive phase ( Fig. 3.1b). It also indicates a substantial warming in the tropical Indian Ocean and a cooling in the equatorial Atlantic and the mid-latitude North Atlantic. The 2009/10 El Ni\u00f1o was preceded by weak La Ni\u00f1a conditions during the winter 2008/09 ( Fig.  3.2a). The tropical Pacific returned to near-normal conditions during boreal spring (Fig. 3.2b), and transitioned into weak El Ni\u00f1o conditions (Ni\u00f1o3.4 > 0.5\u00b0C) during boreal summer (Fig. 3.2c). The June-July-August seasonal mean SSTA was about +1.2\u00b0C in the far eastern equatorial Pacific. It is noteworthy that there were two additional SSTA maxima of about +0.9\u00b0C, one in the subtropical northwestern Pacific that might be related to the positive SSTA in the central North Pacific, and another one in the northeastern Pacific near the coast of Mexico. The positive SSTA in the central-eastern equatorial Pacific strengthened rapidly in October-November 2009, and the 3-month-running mean Ni\u00f1o3.4 (170\u00b0W-120\u00b0W, 5\u00b0N-5\u00b0S) SST was about 1\u00b0C above-normal in September-November 2009, indicating a moderate strength of El Ni\u00f1o (Fig. 3.2d). At the same time, the positive SSTA in the subtropical northwestern Pacific weakened rapidly. It is interesting to note that the positive SSTA in the northeastern tropical Pacific persisted while that in the southeastern tropical Pacific dissipated quickly and switched into negative SSTA in boreal fall. The El Ni\u00f1o reached a peak phase during December 2009, and the SSTA pattern in January 2010 falls into the category of the central-Pacific event or Modoki event (Ashok et al. 2007) in which the larg- | est warming is centered near the date line. Since June 2009 there have been four episodes of downwelling oceanic Kelvin waves associated with westerly wind burst events, which are believed to contribute to the maintenance and strengthening of the 2009/10 El Ni\u00f1o (see \"Monthly Ocean Briefing\" slides from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC), NCEP, at http:// www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/GODAS). The SSTA in the North Pacific was dominated by a negative PDO pattern during the winter 2008/09 and spring 2009, characterized by a horseshoe pattern of positive SSTA extending from the equatorial western Pacific to the mid-latitudes in both hemispheres and negative SSTA extending along the west coast of North America (Fig. 3.2a and Fig. 3.2b). Consistent with the negative PDO phase, upwelling along the west coast of North America was mostly above-normal during the winter 2008/09 and spring 2009 (see the CPC \"Monthly Ocean Briefing\" referred to above). During summer 2009, the PDO phase returned to near-normal (see the PDO index at http://jisao. washington.edu/pdo, Mantua et al. 1997) and El Ni\u00f1o conditions developed in the tropical Pacific (Fig. 3.2c). During fall 2009, the El Ni\u00f1o conditions intensified, while the PDO phase remained near-normal. Note that the PDO phase became weakly above-normal in January 2010, indicating that atmospheric teleconnections from the El Ni\u00f1o started to influence SST in North Pacific. The tropical Indian Ocean SSTA increased substantially from 2008 to 2009. Figure 3.1a shows that the yearly mean SSTA in 2009 was about +0.3\u00b0C (+0.6 \u00b0C) in the central-eastern (western and southwestern) tropical Indian Ocean. The 2009 minus 2008 SSTA differences indicate that SSTA increased by more than 0.6\u00b0C in the western and southeastern tropical Indian Ocean (Fig. 3.1b). As a result, 2009 became the second warmest year in the tropical Indian Ocean behind 1998 when the record warming occurred, which is seen from the basin mean yearly SSTA indices derived from ERSST.v3b for 1950. The increase in the tropical Indian Ocean SST is clearly associated with that in the tropical Pacific Ocean SST (Fig.   3.3c). The section in this chapter on \"Global Ocean Heat Fluxes\" (Yu and Weller 2007), suggests that the basin-wide warming in the tropical Indian Ocean from July to December 2009 can be largely attributed to decrease of latent and sensible heat fluxes due to weakened trade winds from influences of the 2009 El Ni\u00f1o. Figure 3.3c also suggests that the tropical Indian Ocean SST usually warms up significantly in the years following El Ni\u00f1o, e.g., in 1998Ni\u00f1o, e.g., in , 1987Ni\u00f1o, e.g., in , and 1983. The warming in 2009 is somewhat unusual in the sense that it occurred during the El Ni\u00f1o year, rather than in the year after El Ni\u00f1o. The historical perspective of the 2009 SSTA has been shown separately for the (a) global ocean, (b) tropical Indian, (c) tropical Pacific, (d) North Pacific, (e) tropical Atlantic, and (f) North Atlantic in Fig.  3.3. For the global ocean, the SSTA increased from 0.15\u00b0C in 2008 to 0.25\u00b0C in 2009, and became the fourth warmest year behind 1998, 2003, and 2005, the top three warmest years since 1950 ( Fig. 3.3a). The five year running mean of the yearly-mean time series of global SSTA shows that SSTs have trended downward since 2003. However, the downward trend is punctuated by the two consecutive La Ni\u00f1as in 2007 and 2008, which lowered the global mean SST. For the tropical Pacific, the SSTA increased from 0.08\u00b0C in 2008 to 0.34\u00b0C in 2009, and also became the fourth warmest year behind 1997, 2004, and 2002 since 1950 "}, {"section_title": "S56", "text": "JULY 2010 | (Fig. 3.3c). It is interesting that the tropical Atlantic SSTA peaked in 2003 and has decreased slowly since then ( Fig. 3.3e). The North Pacific SST changed little from 2008 to 2009 and has been persistently abovenormal since 1990 ( Fig. 3.3d). The North Atlantic SSTA decreased from 0.6\u00b0C in 2008 to 0.38\u00b0C in 2009 and became the coolest year since 2002 ( Fig. 3.3f). The substantial cooling in the mid-latitude North Atlantic in 2009 is further analyzed here. In Fig. 3.4, we show the evolution of the zonal average SSTA in the North Atlantic along with the CPC North Atlantic Oscillation index and the zonal average LHF+SHF (latent and sensible heat flux) anomalies based on the Objectively Analyzed air-sea Fluxes (OAFlux) project during November 2008-December 2009 (Yu and Weller 2007; http://oaflux.whoi.edu). During the early winter 2008/09, positive SSTA of about +1.5\u00b0C were present in the North Atlantic at 40\u00b0N-50\u00b0N, and SSTA of about +0.6\u00b0C in the tropical North Atlantic (TNA, hereafter) at 5\u00b0N-15\u00b0N. The two maxima of positive SSTA suddenly weakened during January 2009, which coincided with the sudden increase of LHF+SHF at 40\u00b0N-60\u00b0N and 0\u00b0-20\u00b0N. The positive LHF+SHF anomalies in the TNA persisted from January 2009 into February 2009, while those in middle-high latitudes propagated southward into the subtropics, contributing to the SST cooling in the TNA in February 2009. The middle-latitude SST further decreased and became negative in May 2009, probably forced by the positive LHF+SHF anomalies in April-May 2009. The three subsequent cooling episodes of SST that occurred during September, November, and December 2009 correspond well with the three maxima of positive LHF+SHF anomalies. The persistence of the negative SSTA from May 2009 to January 2010 can probably be attributed to the negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) phases during June, July, October, and December 2009, which often cool the SST in middle latitudes and warm the SST in high latitudes and subtropics (Deser and Blackmon 1993), referred to as a negative SST dipole pattern here. The coincidence between negative NAO phases and negative SST dipole patterns seems to support the hypothesis that air-sea coupling plays a significant role in the seasonal variability of the NAO and North Atlantic SST (Czaja and Frankignoul 2002). It is also noted that the positive SSTA persisted and shifted southward, which is also consistent with the tripole SST pattern forced by the NAO. Therefore, the development of the positive SSTA in the TNA during summer can probably be attributed to the strong negative NAO during summer and the subsequent maintenance and enhancement of the TNA SST during fall/winter is likely due to the negative NAO during fall/winter.  (Zebiak 1989), the North Atlantic Oscillation (Curry and Mc-Cartney 2001), hurricanes (Mainelli et al. 2008), sea level rise (Domingues et al. 2008), the global energy budget (Trenberth 2009), and constraining global warming scenarios (Knutti and Tomassini 2008). The accompanying sidebar gives additional perspective. We begin by discussing an estimate of upper-ocean (0-750 m) heat content anomaly (OHCA) for the period 1 January-31 December 2009 ( Fig. 3.5a) computed from a combination of in situ ocean temperature data (World Ocean Database 2009-Johnson et al. 2009aand Argo -Roemmich et al. 2009) and satellite altimetry data following Willis et al. (2004) but relative to a 1993-2009 baseline (the altimetry time period), hereafter the combined estimate. We also discuss changes in the combined estimate between 2009 and 2008 ( Fig. 3.5b), as well as maps of the linear trend of the combined estimate from 1993-2009 and its statistical significance (Fig. 3.6). Finally, we present three different time series of global integrals of in situ only estimates of upper OHCA (Fig. 3.7). In recent years many of the globally distributed in situ subsurface ocean temperature data are from Argo. Data from Argo floats with the potential for as yet uncorrected systematic pressure biases (http:// www.argo.ucsd.edu/Acpres_drift_apex.html) have been removed from the combined estimate. In ad-dition, annual estimates of XBT fall rate corrections have been applied for deep and shallow probe data using Table 2 of Wijffels et al. (2008) but with no XBT data used after 2005. Details of all the fields analyzed here may change after more Argo real-time data are subject to delayed-mode scientific quality control, as more data are reported, and as XBT and MBT corrections improve. The combined estimate of OHCA in 2009 ( Fig.  3.5a) shows eddy and meander variability down to the 100-km mapping scales, as does, to a greater extent, the difference of the 2009 and 2008 combined estimates (Fig. 3.5b). Strong small-scale spatial variability in OHCA fields is associated with the western boundary currents in every gyre, as well as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (Fig. 3.5b). The difference in the combined estimates between 2009 and 2008 ( Fig. 3.5b) illustrates the large year-to-year variability in ocean heat storage. Of course internal ocean dynamics, such as advection and heave, certainly play a significant role in many of these changes but for purposes of comparison only, they reach or exceed the equivalent of a 95 W m -2 magnitude surface flux applied over one year (~3 \u00d7 10 9 J m -2 ). Upper OHCA, deep variability, freshwater, and mass signals all contribute to sea level anomalies. Despite this, there are many large-scale visual similarities between the combined estimate ( Fig. 3.5a) and sea level ( Fig. 3.22 top) fields in 2009, even relative to their differing baseline periods. This similarity shows the large contribution of heat content variations to sea level variations. Large-scale patterns are evident in the combined estimate of OHCA for 2009 ( Fig. 3.5a) and its difference from 2008 ( Fig. 3.5b). The equatorial Pacific gained heat during the El Ni\u00f1o that commenced this year (see also Fig. 4.7) as did the off-equatorial central and eastern tropical Pacific. Despite declines in OHCA in the western tropical Pacific (excepting the Coral Sea that gained heat since 2008), OHCA there remains well above the mean. While the annual averaging period presented here is too long for detailed study of the ocean advection of heat associated with ENSO dynamics (but see Chapter 4), certainly those processes contribute to the change on the equator and perhaps those in the off-equatorial regions (Zebiak 1989). The North Pacific shows high OHCA in its center in 2009, with low OHCA to the south, off the west coast of North America and into the eastern Bering Sea (Fig. 3.5a). This pattern is consonant with a negative Pacific Decadal Oscillation index (Mantua et al.   (Fig.  3.5a) appears to have steadily migrated south from tropical latitudes since 2006 (Arguez 2007;Levinson and Lawrimore 2008;Peterson and Baringer 2009). The Indian Ocean is mostly warmer than the baseline in 2009 ( Fig. 3.5a). The northern Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean west of the Indonesian Seas gained heat between 2008 and 2009 ( Fig. 3.5b) and stand out as warmer than the rest of the region in 2009. In the Subpolar North Atlantic, the Labrador and Irminger Seas, which cooled between 2007 and 2008 (Peterson and Baringer 2009) continued to cool between 2009 (Fig. 3.5b), so OHCA values in these areas are now below the 1993-2009 mean (Fig.  3.5a). This change is consonant with a return of deep wintertime convection in this region during early 2008 (V\u00e5ge et al. 2009) and the associated export of heat from ocean to atmosphere. The continued high OHCA values in the eastern subpolar North Atlantic (Fig. 3.5a) suggest that subtropical influences are still strong there, consistent with anomalously salty surface conditions in that region in 2009 ( Fig. 3.13a). The subtropical and tropical Atlantic in both hemispheres remains slightly warmer than the mean, with little change from 2008 to 2009. Near the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, OHCA is highly variable (Fig. 3.5a), but appears anomalously warm around the globe, consistent with recent studies (B\u00f6ning et al. 2008), except perhaps in the eastern Pacific. Western boundary current extensions in the North Pacific and both hemispheres of the Atlantic are energetic, with large year-to-year changes (Fig.  3.5b). A few very distinct (Fig. 3.6a) and statistically significant ( Fig. 3.6b) regional patterns in the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean stand out in the 1993-2009 local linear trends of OHCA. In the Atlantic Ocean, the Labrador, Irminger, and Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian Seas have all trended warmer over the interval, reflecting a robust regional warming trend over the longer time period (Fig. 3.6a) that has not been overcome by the recent cooling there (Fig. 3.5a) in the last few years. These changes are related to variations the NAO index. In addition, the eastern portions of the Atlantic trends warmer across both hemispheres. As in the 2009 OHCA map, areas of warming appear more widespread than areas of cooling. The statistically significant (Fig. 3.6b) 1993-2009 regional trends in the Pacific Ocean (Fig. 3.6a) are of warming in the western tropical Pacific and offequatorial cooling in the east, consistent with general strengthening of the subtropical-tropical circulation in the past two decades (McPhaden and Zhang 2004). The statistically significant warming in the central North Pacific and cooling south of Alaska and off the west coast of North America are also consistent with an overall downward trend in the PDO index (Mantua et al. 1997(Mantua et al. ) from 1993(Mantua et al. to 2009 Three different upper ocean estimates (0-700 m) of globally integrated in situ OHCA (Fig. 3.7) reveal a large increase in global integrals of that quantity since 1993. The interannual details of the time series differ for a variety of reasons including differences in climatology, treatment of the seasonal cycle, mapping methods, instrument bias corrections, quality control, and other factors. Most of these factors are not taken into account in the displayed uncertainties, so while the error bars shown do not always overlap among the three estimates, these estimates are not necessarily statistically different from each other because the error bars are likely unrealistically small. Even so, errors are too large to obtain reliable trends over a few years. However, the three curves all agree on a significant decadal warming of the upper ocean since 1993, accounting for a large portion of the global energy imbalance over this time period (Trenberth 2009), and the three sets of maps (not shown) from which the curves are produced show similar largescale features."}, {"section_title": "d.

PALMER, K. HAINES AND J. M. LYMAN", "text": "Quantifying and understanding changes in global and regional ocean heat content (OHC) are of fundamental importance to climate science. The long-term increase in OHC has an important contribution to sea level rise (Antonov et al. 2002(Antonov et al. , 2005Domingues et al. 2008), reflects a first-order estimate of Earth's radiation balance (Levitus et al. 2005;Murphy et al. 2009), and provides a powerful constraint on model projections of future surface temperature rise (Knutti and Tomassini 2008). Here we review some of the major progress made in OHC research since publication of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) (Fig. 3.8). The first major advance is the quantification of a time-varying warm bias in the expendable bathythermograph data (XBT), which constitute a large fraction of the historical subsurface temperature observations (Gouretski and Koltermann 2007). This warm bias, in combination with a small number of faulty Argo floats, was responsible for the spurious cooling seen in the AR4 results over the period 2003-05 ( Fig. 3.8; Willis et al. 2007). We note that since profiling floats are still a relatively new technology, there may be some unresolved biases in the Argo data. Several groups have estimated XBT bias corrections and computed OHC timeseries -a marked increase in OHC work since the AR4. These new XBT-corrected OHC time series (Fig. 3.9) show a reduction in the decadal variability compared to the AR4 results ( Fig. 3.8), improving agreement with coupled climate model simulations (Domingues et al. 2008). However, there are still considerable differences in interannual variability among the XBT-corrected curves that require further investigation. The impact of XBT corrections on the long-term trend varies (Wijffels et al. 2008;Ishii and Kimoto 2009;Levitus et al. 2009;Gouretski and Reseghetti 2010), but all the time series show an underlying rise in OHC consistent with our understanding of anthropogenic climate change. The limited historical ocean sampling (AchutaRao et al. 2006) has motivated a novel approach to understanding the observed changes in OHC from a more mechanistic point of view. Palmer et al. (2007) have evaluated the ocean warming signal relative to fixed isotherms. This approach seeks to separate the influence of air-sea heat flux and ocean circulation in observed OHC change by measuring the average temperature above an isotherm and isotherm depth, respectively (Palmer and Haines 2009). The average temperature above isotherms is also immune to one known contributor to XBT bias, namely fall rate errors (e.g., Wijffels et al. 2008). By isolating the air-sea heat flux signal of ocean warming, the isotherm methodology has enabled the separate detection and attribution of volcanic and anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcings in the ocean temperature record for the first time (Palmer et al. 2009). However, due to the inherent spatial limitations, this method does not directly address the global energy budget. The deployment of the Argo array of autonomous profiling floats over the last decade has revolutionized our ability to observe the deeper ocean (Roemmich et al. 2009). There are currently over 3000 active floats measuring temperature and salinity over the upper 2000 m every 10 days. Argo is already providing a uniformly sampled baseline for assessing past OHC changes (Lyman and Johnson 2008). A sustained Argo promises to give the detailed information on upper ocean warming that is critical to understanding the rates of global and regional climate change and for testing and improving climate models (Barnett et al. 2005). Argo data will also provide the key to initializing climate models to make better seasonal to decadal predictions in the future . The XBT-corrected OHC curves level off after 2003 ( Fig. 3.9, see also Fig 3.7). Knight et al. (2009) noted a recent slowing of observed sea surface temperature rise at around the same time. However, sea level rise has continued at around 2 mm yr -1 since 2003 (Leuliette and Miller 2009; see also section 3h). Recent work suggests that the reduction in ocean thermal expansion over this period was partly offset by an increase in oceanic mass gain from melting terrestrial ice (Cazanave et al. 2009). Trenberth et al. (2010, see also Trenberth andFasullo 2010) point out that melting of ice requires at least an order of magnitude less energy per unit sea level rise than ocean thermal expansion. Assuming that the top-of-atmosphere radiation balance of approximately 0.9 W m -2 has remained constant in recent years, an emerging issue is \"where has this excess energy gone since 2003?\" Deep ocean warming may account for some of the missing energy (Johnson and Doney 2006;Johnson et al. 2007;Johnson et al. 2008a). Only with a truly global ocean observing system can we close fully the global energy and sea level budgets, so we must improve our observations of the ocean below 2000 m where Argo floats currently do not reach.  spheric circulation, and their changes on short-and long-term timescales have important implications for global weather and climate patterns (e.g., Emanuel 1986;Cayan 1992;Frankignoul et al. 1998)."}, {"section_title": "cont'", "text": "Global estimates of daily ocean latent and sensible heat fluxes on one-degree spatial resolution are being routinely produced by the OAFlux project at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (Yu and Weller 2007).

The global latent plus sensible heat f luxes (LHF+SHF) in 2009 ( Fig. 3.10a) show that, on the annual-mean basis, the largest ocean heat losses occur over the regions that are associated with major western boundary currents (WBCs) and their extensions, such as the Kuroshio off Japan, the Gulf Stream off the United States, the Agulhas current off the African coast, the Falkland/Brazilian Current off South America, and the Eastern Australian Current. Magnitude of annual mean LHF+SHF in these regions exceeds 250 W m -2 , produced largely during the fallto-winter seasons by strong winds and cold and dry air masses coming from the lands. The second largest heat loss (~180 W m -2 ) is located over the broad subtropical southern Indian Ocean, where the large air-sea heat exchange is sustained primarily by the strong southeast trade winds in the monsoon months June-September. The spatial distribution of the mean global LHF+SHF field depicts a close relationship of LHF+SHF to SST and winds. The 2009-minus-2008 difference plot of LHF+SHF ( Fig. 3.10b) shows coordinated basin-scale variability with magnitude of change of the order of \u00b150 W m -2 . One such large-scale change occurred in the tropical Pacific Ocean in association with an evolving warm phase of the ENSO phenomenon. During an El Ni\u00f1o, the sea surface is anomalously warm in the central and eastern equatorial basin and anomalously cool in the western basin ( Fig. 3.1). The change in SST affects the near surface humidities, because saturation specific humidity goes up with temperature, and the change in sea-air humidity contrast affects latent heat flux. Hence, latent heat increased over the warm SST anomalies in the east and reduced over the cool SST anomalies in the west. The larger latent heat released from the warmer ocean surface acts to damp the positive SST anomalies, suggesting that the ocean heat flux is a key control on the persistence and amplitude of SST anomalies. Variability of ocean heat fluxes in the tropical Pacific on ENSO time scales is a dominant interannual signal (e.g., Yu and Weller 2007), and the ocean heat flux acts as a damping mechanism that regulates the growth of ENSO SST. ENSO has far-reaching effects on global climate, and one such example is clearly demonstrated in the tropical Indian Ocean. Positive SST anomalies started to develop in the tropical Indian Ocean (IO) north of 15\u00b0S in summer 2009 after the El Ni\u00f1o conditions were fully established in the Pacific. The SSTs were elevated by more than 0.5\u00b0C from July to December 2009 ( Fig. 3.11a). However, the basin-wide LHF reduced when the sea surface was warmer (Fig. 3.11b), which is in sharp contrast to the LHF increase over the warmer eastern tropical Pacific. Weaker LHF means less heat loss at the sea surface, whose effect S62 JULY 2010 | is to cause SST to rise if oceanic processes (e.g., mixing and advection) do not dominate. The weaker LHF was induced primarily by the weaker trade winds associated with the weakening of the Walker Circulation during El Ni\u00f1o, similar to the previous ENSO-induced IO warm events (Yu and Rienecker 2000). In this case, the impact of ocean heat flux was to force, not to damp, the SST anomalies. For the Pacific Ocean, the SST 2009-minus-2008 difference map has a pattern resembling the warm phase of PDO: there is a horseshoe shaped region of negative difference anomalies surrounding a core of warmer difference anomalies to the east. The pattern suggests that the PDO phase became less negative in 2009. Indeed, the negative phase that started in September 2007 began to taper off in the first half of 2009 (http://jisao.washington.edu/pdo/PDO.latest) and since July 2009, the PDO index was mostly positive because of the El Ni\u00f1o event developing in the equatorial region during fall and winter 2009/10. The 2009-minus-2008 difference map of LHF+SHF (Fig.  3.10b) has a pattern in broad agreement with that of SST ( Fig. 3.1), because the ocean heat flux responded to the SST anomalies and acted as damping to suppress the growth of SST anomalies. Unlike the Pacific where the correlation between SST and LHF+SHF difference anomalies is positive, the correlation between the pair is negative in the Atlantic. For instance, the 2009 SSTs in the Atlantic were predominantly cooler than the 2008 SSTs, except for the subtropical Atlantic between 15\u00b0N and 30\u00b0N and the high-northern latitudes. The surface warming in the subtropical region, together with the cooling to its north and south, was in apparent association with the NAO tripole structure. The tripole pattern is also evident in the LHF+SHF 2009-08 difference field, but positive (negative) LHF+SHF anomalies occurred mostly over cooler (warmer) sea surface. It is known that the NAO SST tripole is due primarily to the oceanic response to atmospheric forcing via the effects of the changes in LHF+SHF and surface wind induced Ekman currents (Cayan 1992;Deser and Blackmon 1993). The negative correlation between SST and LHF+SHF tripole in 2009 is consistent with the existing theory, indicating that the Atlantic basinscale SST variability in 2009 was driven primarily by the atmospheric forcing: SST increases (decreases) as a result of reduced (enhanced) latent and sensible heat loss at the sea surface. This is seen clearly in Fig. 3.3 where a series of surface cooling episodes in the North Atlantic between 40-60\u00b0N can be well explained by the changes in the ocean heat flux. The changing relationships between LHF+SHF and SST in the global oceans indicate that the ocean heat fluxes played a dual role in the dynamics of large-scale SST anomalies: they not only generated SST anomalies (such as in the North Atlantic and the tropical Indian Oceans) but also acted to damp SST anomalies that had already been generated (such as in the tropical and extratropical Pacific). The long-term perspective of the change in 2009 LHF+SHF is shown in the annual mean time series averaged over the global oceans from 1958 to 2009 ( Fig. 3.12). The 2009 LHF+SHF was slightly down from the 2008 mean (Peterson and Baringer 2009), continuing the downward trend that started around  | 2000. The downward trend is driven primarily by LHF with minor positive contribution from SHF. Over the past 51 years from 1958 to 2009, the LHF+SHF time series suggests an oscillatory nature, with a low at 99 W m -2 in 1977 and a high at 109 W m -2 in 1999. The present downward trend seems to be a tendency toward reversing the upward trend that had dominated the decades of 1980s and 1990s. The accuracy of the OAFlux LHF and SHF estimates was evaluated using 105 buoys available over the global oceans (Yu et al. 2008). The averaged root-meansquare differences between OAFlux and buoy over the buoy locations are 9.6 W m -2 for LHF and 2.6 W m -2 for SHF."}, {"section_title": "e. Sea surface salinity-G. C. Johnson and J. M. Lyman", "text": "Ocean storage and transport of freshwater are intrinsic to aspects of global climate including the water cycle (e.g., Wijffels et al. 1992), El Ni\u00f1o (e.g., Maes et al. 2006), and anthropogenic climate change (e.g., Held and Soden 2006). Only since 2004 has the advent of the Argo array of profiling floats, that measures temperature and salinity year-round in the upper 2 km of the ice-free global ocean, nominally at 10-day intervals and 3\u00b0 \u00d7 3\u00b0 spacing (Roemmich et al. 2009), allowed an annual assessment of global ocean freshwater, and its complement, salinity. Remote sensing of Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) by two satellites is anticipated in 2010 (http://www.esa.int/esaLP/ LPsmos.html; http://aquarius.gsfc.nasa.gov/). We analyze the near-global Argo data to determine an annual average SSS anomaly for 2009 relative to a climatology and to describe how annual SSS anomalies have changed in 2009 relative to 2008, as well as assessing trends in salinity since 2004 and their statistical significance. The data, downloaded from an Argo Global Data Assembly Center in January 2010, are a mix of real-time (preliminary) and delayed mode (scientific quality-controlled) data. The estimates of SSS presented could change after all the data have been subjected to careful scientific quality control. We subject the shallowest near-surface (< 25 m) salinity data flagged as good from each available Argo profile to a statistical check to discard outliers resulting in rejection of 8% of the profiles. After this check, we cast the remaining data as differences from a climatological mean surface salinity field from the 2001 World Ocean Atlas (WOA) based on historical data reported through 2001 (Boyer et al. 2002). We objectively map (Bretherton et al. 1976) the resulting anomalies for each year assuming a Gaussian covariance function with 6\u00b0 latitude and longitude decorrelation length scales and a noise-to-signal variance ratio of 2.2. Climatological SSS patterns are correlated with surface freshwater f lux: the sum of evaporation, precipitation, and river runoff (e.g., B\u00e9ranger et al. 1999) where advection processes are not dominant. In each ocean basin, subtropical salinity maxima centered between roughly 20\u00b0 and 25\u00b0 in latitude are signatures of the predominance of evaporation over precipitation. Conversely, in most regions where climatological surface salinities are relatively fresh, such as the high latitudes and the ITCZs precipitation generally dominates over evaporation. The 2009 SSS anomalies from WOA ( Fig. 3.13a) reveal some large-scale patterns that also hold in 2004 through 2008 (Arguez 2007;Levinson and Lawrimore 2008;Peterson and Baringer 2009). The  regions around the subtropical salinity maxima are mostly salty with respect to WOA. Most of the high-latitude climatologically fresh regions appear fresher than WOA, including most of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current near 50\u00b0S and the subpolar gyre of the North Pacific. These patterns may be consistent with an increase in the hydrological cycle (i.e., more evaporation in drier locations, and more precipitation in rainy areas), as seen in simulations of global warming. These simulations suggest this signal might be discernible over the last two decades of the twentieth century (Held and Soden 2006), consistent with the multi-year nature of these anomalies. Nonetheless, there may be alternate explanations. It is possible that the climatology, being based on relatively sparse data distributions in many parts of the oceans, may tend to underestimate regional extrema that the well-sampled Argo array can better resolve, or that the climatology contains regional biases on seasonal or longer time-scales that are not present in the Argo data. Also, some of these patterns might be explained by interannual variability in large-scale oceanic currents or atmospheric features such as the ITCZs. For example, in contrast to the other high-latitude areas, the subpolar North Atlantic and Nordic Seas in 2009 are anomalously salty with respect to WOA (Fig. 3.13a), as they have been since at least 2004. This salty subpolar anomaly is inconsistent with a simple increase in the strength of the hydrological cycle. However, the pattern appears mostly due to northward spread of saltier subtropical waters from the south into the northeastern North Atlantic since the mid-1990s (Holliday et al. 2008;Hakkinnen and Rhines 2009). This trend towards increasing salinity in the region may have halted or even reversed recently, since salinities in the area freshened slightly from 2008 to 2009 ( Fig. 3.13b) and show no large-scale significant trend since 2004 ( Fig. 3.14). Salinity in the tropics exhibits strong interannual variability owing to influences of phenomena such as the ENSO cycle (e.g., Ando and McPhaden 1997). For instance, the western equatorial Pacific fresh pool spread eastward from 2008 to 2009 ( Fig. 3.13b), with the freshening in this region at least partly owing to anomalous eastward currents along the equator (Fig. 3.15) in the presence of the mean zonal salinity gradient there. In contrast, the Atlantic ITCZ became saltier. In addition, the strong fresh anomaly found south of India in the tropics in 2006 (Arguez 2007) has steadily weakened over the past few years (Levinson and Lawrimore 2008;Peterson and Baringer 2009) and is now absent in 2009. Tropical salinity changes from  show some visual similarities with changes in latent and short wave heat fluxes between the years (Fig. 3.10b), as might be expected given the relation of these parameters to evaporation. We estimate linear trends from 2004-09 ( Fig.  3.14a), since Argo coverage became near global in 2004, and the ratio of these trends to their 95% significance ( Fig. 3.14b). The most striking trend patterns are in the Pacific. Saltier surface values in the western and central tropical Pacific extend into the eastern Pacific subtropics in both hemispheres. A strong freshening also occurs in the western subtropics of each hemisphere in the Pacific and the far western tropical Pacific, extending into the Indian Ocean northwest of Australia. The other large-scale patterns include freshening in the tropical Southeast Pacific and along the equatorial Atlantic. f. Surface currents-R. Lumpkin, G. Goni, and K. Dohan Near-surface currents are measured in situ by drogued satellite-tracked drifting buoys and by current meters on moored Autonomous Temperature Line Acquisition System (ATLAS) buoys. 1 During 2009, the drifter array ranged in size from a minimum of 778 drogued buoys to a maximum of 1149, with a median size of 937 drogued buoys (undrogued drifters continue to measure SST, but are subject to significant wind slippage; Niiler et al. 1987). The moored array included 38 buoys with current meters, all between 12\u00b0S and 21\u00b0N. These tropical moorings compose the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO; Pacific), Pilot Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA; Atlantic) and Research Moored Array for African-Asian-Australian Monsoon Analysis and Prediction (RAMA; Indian) arrays. Satellite-based estimates of ocean currents are produced using several methodologies, including the OSCAR (Ocean Surface Current Analyses-Real time) project, which uses satellite altimetry, winds, SST, and the Rio05 mean dynamic topography from the AVISO Ssalto/Duacs multimission altimeter gridded product (Rio and Hernandez 2004) to create onedegree resolution surface current maps averaged over the 0-30 m layer of the ocean (Bonjean and Lagerloef 2002).

In November through December, eastward anomalies dominated the entire equatorial band of the Pacific Ocean (Fig. 3.16). Surface current anomalies in the equatorial Pacific typically lead SST anomalies by several months, with a magnitude that scales with the SST anomaly magnitude.

Eastward anomalies of up to 50 cm s -1 occurred along the equatorial Atlantic in April through May, in response to weaker than normal Trade Winds that were also associated with anomalously cold SSTs in the northeastern Tropical Atlantic. This eastward anomaly pattern was disrupted in June-July, when westward anomalies developed east of 20\u00b0W in the Guinea Current region. By July, these currents had returned to normal climatological values. Against the east coast of South America, the southward-flowing warm, salty Brazil Current meets the northward flowing cold, fresh Malvinas Current to create the Confluence Front. Over the last 15 years, the location of this front has shifted to the south at a mean speed of nearly 1\u00b0 latitude per decade (Goni et al. 2010, manuscript submitted to Deep-Sea Res.; Lumpkin and Garzoli 2010, manuscript submitted to J. Geophys. Res.). However, most of this shift occurred in the early part of the altimeter-derived time series; while it exhibits strong intraseasonal to seasonal fluctuations (Goni and Wainer 2001), its annual-averaged position has not changed significantly since 1998, and in 2009 it fluctuated between 37\u00b0 and 39\u00b0S. The meridional redistribution of mass and heat associated with the large-scale vertical circulation within the oceans is typically called the meridional overturning circulation (MOC). The most common definition of the strength of the MOC at any particular latitude is the maximum of the vertically integrated basinwide stream function, which changes as a function of latitude and time and is influenced by many physical systems embedded within it. There are several available estimates of the steady-state global mass, fresh water, and heat transport based on the best available hydrographic data (Talley 2008;Lumpkin and Speer 2007;Ganachaud and Wunsch 2003), as well as a few local estimates of the MOC from one-time full water column hydrographic sections and western boundary arrays (e.g., McDonagh et al. 2008;Kanzow et al. 2008); however, true timeseries observations of basinwide MOC transports are logistically very challenging to collect. Substantial progress has been made on developing a coordinated observing system to measure the MOC through the international conference called OceanObs09 held September, 2009. The conference resulted in numerous community white papers and | conference summary papers aimed at synthesizing recommendations for a sustained observing system including measurements of the MOC (e.g., Cunningham et al. 2010;Rintoul et al. 2010). Presently, quantifying changes in the complex, global MOC are being inferred only from observations of one component of the MOC (e.g., a specific current or ocean layer; e.g., Kanzow et al. 2008), at discrete locations (e.g., at 26.5\u00b0N in the Atlantic; Cunningham et al. 2007;Kanzow et al. 2007;Johns et al. 2008), or from indirect measurements such as air-sea fluxes thought to force the MOC (e.g., Marsh 2000;Speer 1997), or indirect measurements thought to be influenced by changes of the MOC, such as deep property fields like temperature or salinity (e.g., Johnson et al. 2008b). A prototype for the recommended observing system has been in place since April 2004, spanning the subtropical gyre in the North Atlantic near 26.5\u00b0N, hence this note concentrates on those observations. The system is composed of UK-NERC RAPID MOC moorings, US-NSF Meridional Overturning Circulation Heat-Transport Array (MOCHA), and the US-NOAA Western Boundary Time Series program (see Kanzow et al. 2007;Kanzow et al. 2008;Cunningham et al. 2007). The most up-to-date estimates of the MOC from the 26.5\u00b0N array include data from April 2004 to April 2008 3 (Cunningham et al. 2007;Kanzow et al. 2010, manuscript submitted to J. Climate). Over this time period the MOC has averaged 18.7 Sv with a high of 32.1 Sv, a low of 3.2 Sv, and a standard deviation of 4.8 Sv (using the twice daily values filtered with a 10-day cutoff as described in Cunningham et al. 2007). The data suggest no significant trend in the strength of the MOC. After four years of data, a seasonal signal is beginning to emerge (Fig. 3.19) with a low MOC in April and a high MOC in October and peak to trough range of about 7 Sv. The MOC can be divided into three components: the northward western boundary Florida Current, the wind-driven Ekman transport, and the southward \"interior\" transport (upper ocean geostrophic flow between the Bahamas and Africa). The seasonal cycle of the MOC appears to be largely attributable to seasonal variability in the interior rather than Ekman or Florida Current fluctuations (Kanzow et al. 2010, manuscript submitted to J. Climate). Of note is that all the MOC transport values estimated from five repeated CTD sections by Bryden et al. (2005) can be found within the seasonal range of the MOC time series (values ranged from 22.9 Sv in 2004 to 14.8 Sv in 1957). These results do not disprove the presence of a long-term trend in the strength of the MOC (e.g., as suggested by Bryden et al. 2005;Wunsch and Heimbach 2006), but they do suggest that a careful error analysis must be performed that includes the impact of the underlying higher-frequency variability of the MOC on trend estimates (e.g., Baehr et al. 2008;Baehr et al. 2007;Brennan et al. 2008). Other related studies of the MOC trend are, so far, contradictory with some reporting a decrease in the MOC or components of the MOC (e.g., Wunsch and Heimbach 2006;Longworth et al. 2010, unpublished manuscript) while others suggest no change or even an increase (e.g., K\u00f6hl and Stammer 2008;Zhang 2008;Olsen et al. 2008;Lumpkin et al. 2008;Schott et al. 2009). Clearly, while disagreement remains over the details of findings from any particular observing systems (e.g., Kanzow et al. 2009), agreement exists | that longer time series at multiple locations, particularly of the deep transport components, is needed (e.g., Wunsch 2008). One of the main components of the MOC estimate near 26.5\u00b0N is the Florida Current transport, the longest transport time series of an ocean circulation feature directly linked to the MOC. Near this latitude in the Atlantic the bulk of the warm upper limb of the Atlantic MOC is thought to be carried in the Florida Current through the Straits of Florida and the majority of the cold lower limb is believed to be carried to the south in the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) just east of the Bahamas (e.g., Baringer and Larsen 2001;Meinen et al. 2010). Since 1982, variations in an important contributor to the upper limb of the Atlantic MOC have been monitored by measuring the Florida Current transport using a submarine cable across the Straits of Florida in combination with regular hydrographic sections. In 2009 the median transport through the Florida Straits was 31.3 \u00b1 1.2 Sv 4 , slightly lower than the 31.7 \u00b1 2.2 Sv median transport in 2008, but well within the middle range 4 Standard error of the mean represents 95% confidence limits. of mean annual values (32.2 Sv median transport of the Florida Straits from 1982 to 2008 with 50% of the annual means within +/-2.2 Sv). There were, however, several unusual high-frequency events during the year (Fig. 3.20): anomalously low-transport (outside of two standard deviations of the daily averaged values) events during 20-22 May, 18-27 June, 14-15 November, and 21-22 December, with values as low as about 23 Sv and an unusually high transport 11-12 July, with values as high as about 38 Sv. Due to the fact that these events were relatively short-lived, it is likely they are local responses to atmospheric forcing and coastally trapped wave processes and are not particularly indicative of a climatically-important shift (e.g., Mooers et al. 2005). However, these transient fluctuations can have important environmental consequences. In the summer of 2009, the east coast of the United States experienced a high sea level event that was unusual due to it unexpected timing, large geographic scope, and coastal flooding that was not associated with any storms (Sweet et al. 2009). Sweet et al. (2009) showed that this anomalous event was related to the anomalously low Florida Current transport: a reduced Florida Current transport corresponds to a lower sea surface height gradient across the front and hence higher sea level onshore. Changes in Florida Current transport and the associated MOC have been similarly shown to affect sea level along the east coast of the United States through other studies such as Bingham and Hughes (2009) and Yin et al. (2009).

Over the last few years, we have presented annual global air-sea CO 2 flux estimates based on empirical approaches relating in situ measurements with satellite observations of wind and sea surface temperature (Sabine et al. 2008(Sabine et al. , 2009. The latest empirical approach for quantifying the air-sea CO 2 exchange utilizing in situ, climatological, and satellite data is described in Park et al. (2010, manuscript submitted to Tellus B). Lags in availability of quality controlled data streams including atmospheric CO 2 , satellite and assimilation products preclude real-time analysis such that consistent, climate quality seasonal air-sea CO 2 flux maps are only available through 2008. The global mean air-sea CO 2 flux for the period from 1982 to 2008 gives an average contemporary net uptake of 1.48 Pg (10 15 g) C yr -1 . Following the Gruber et al. (2009) assumption that the preindustrial steady state ocean was a source of 0.45 Pg C yr -1 , the estimated average flux equates to a net ocean anthropogenic CO 2 uptake of 1.93 Pg C yr -1 , consistent with the range of estimates (1.8-2.4 Pg-C yr -1 ) recently summarized by Gruber et al. (2009). Using the Park et al. (2010, manuscript submitted to Tellus B) approach the global net uptake flux for 2008 is estimated to be 1.23 Pg C yr -1 , 0.25 Pg C yr -1 smaller than the 27-year long-term average (Fig. 3.26). The uncertainty of the empirical flux estimates is difficult to evaluate as discussed in detail in Park et al. (2006), but the 2008 uptake is significantly lower than the 1\u03c3 interannual variability estimate of \u00b10.14 Pg C yr -1 for the whole record. Compared to long-term average fluxes, 2008 generally showed less CO 2 uptake and more CO 2 release with a few notable exceptions including the high-latitude North Atlantic, the eastern subtropical North Pacific, and portions of the Southern Ocean. Greater CO 2 efflux was found in the Equatorial Pacific due to the strengthened upwelling of deep water rich in CO 2 . As noted by Takahashi et al. (2009a) the 2008 flux estimates also show areas near 60\u00b0S located along the edge of the seasonal seaice field had less uptake of CO 2 in summer time and more release of CO 2 in winter time. Despite a band of increased CO 2 uptake in the eastern North Pacific, overall the North Pacific uptake was lower in 2008 relative to the long-term average. Several recent publications have described regional variations in CO 2 uptake patterns, particularly in the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean, as the ocean carbon community works to distinguish secular trends from natural interannual variations (e.g., LeQuere et al. 2009;Watson et al. 2009;Metzl 2009;Lenton et al. 2009). For example, recent observations suggest a rapid decrease in the CO 2 uptake in the temperate North Atlantic. However, Thomas et al. (2008) used a general circulation model study to infer that the North Atlantic CO 2 uptake may increase again when the NAO returns to a positive state, similar to the early 1990s. The empirical approach for evaluating the annual CO 2 flux gives an estimated interannual variability of \u00b10.14 Pg C yr -1 over the last three decades. While variability in the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean are observed in our analyses, the largest interannual variations are associated with ENSO changes. A negative correlation (R 2 ~0.68) is observed in a plot of the yearly Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) values versus the annual global air-sea CO 2 uptake estimates for the period from 1982 to 2008 ( Fig. 3.27). A negative MEI value indicates La Ni\u00f1a conditions and thus enhanced CO 2 outgassing in the Equatorial Pacific. In last year's report we described the CO 2 flux patterns associated with the moderate 2007 La Ni\u00f1a (Sabine et al. 2009). The conditions described here for 2008 reflect the second strongest La Ni\u00f1a conditions in the 27-year record and show an overall global ocean flux response of increased outgassing that was consistent with these conditions (Fig. 3.27). In 2009, the ENSO switched from La Ni\u00f1a to El Ni\u00f1o conditions (chapter 4b). Interestingly, both shipboard measurements and moored CO 2 observations along the equator are showing a pattern of sustained CO 2 outgassing even in the presence of significant positive temperature anomalies. This switch to El Ni\u00f1o conditions was too recent to evaluate with the climate quality seasonal CO 2 flux maps, but preliminary estimates based on lower quality remotely sensed data are available to within three months of present (see http://cwcgom.aoml.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/ aomlcarbonfluxes.graph). These preliminary results also suggest that large-scale equatorial fluxes are not following the historical El Ni\u00f1o patterns. The empirical CO 2 flux model generally agrees well with GCM models in both the timing and magnitude of the Equatorial Pacific flux anomalies associated with ENSO ( Fig. 3.28). However, the correlation did not hold with the latest El Ni\u00f1o in 2002. The GCM model suggested a significant decrease in outgassing from the Equatorial Pacific which would be expected from the El Ni\u00f1o conditions, but did not seem to be reflected in the in situ observations or the empirical model ( Fig. 3.28). The mechanisms responsible for the break down in correlation between the El Ni\u00f1o and the CO 2 during this last El Ni\u00f1o event are being investigated, but the pattern seems to be repeating with this current 2009/10 El Ni\u00f1o. It could be related to the relative roles of horizontal advection versus vertical advection when the warming is focused on the Central Pacific compared to the Eastern Pacific but the data collected during the 2009/10 event will help us to better understand these mechanisms."}, {"section_title": "2) subsurface carbOn inventOry", "text": "In the 1990s carbon samples were collected and analyzed from approximately 95 research cruises run as part of the international World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) and the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS). Based on these data, Sabine et al. (2004) estimated that the total inventory of anthropogenic CO 2 in the ocean (C ant ) in the year 1994 was 118\u00b119 Pg C, accounting for 48% of the CO 2 released from fossil fuel burning between 1800 and 1994. This one-time global survey, however, could not provide information on how ocean carbon inventories have evolved over time or how the storage has varied geographically over different time periods. In 2003, the U.S. CLIVAR/CO 2 Repeat Hydrography Program began reoccupying a subset of the WOCE/JGOFS ocean survey lines. The program has identified 19 hydrographic sections distributed around the global ocean that will be reoccupied approximately every 10 years to examine changes in ocean carbon and other physical and biogeochemical tracers (http://ushydro.ucsd.edu/). This work is being conducted in collaboration with other nations that have similar repeat hydrography programs. In 2009 a zonal line (designated as I5) across the southern Indian Ocean, nominally along 32\u00b0S, was completed as part of the U.S. CLIVAR/CO 2 Repeat Hydrography Program. The top panel of Fig. 3.29 shows a section of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) along I5 in 2009. Unfortunately, very few DIC measurements were made on the previous occupation of I5 by the British in 2002, but DIC can be calculated with reasonable accuracy from the total alkalinity and spectrophotometric pH measurements that were made. The calculated 2002 DIC distributions are shown in the middle panel of Fig. 3.29. The accuracy of the calculated DIC values is estimated to be \u00b14  \u00b5mol kg -1 or about half of the accuracy of the directly measured values. This accuracy was confirmed by comparison with a few dozen DIC samples that were collected and analyzed from the cruise. To the first order the DIC distributions look similar for both years, but the difference plot ( Fig.  3.29, bottom) shows that DIC generally increased throughout the upper 1000 m of the water column presumably resulting primarily from the uptake of anthropogenic CO 2 from the atmosphere. The magnitude of the changes is quite patchy with variations ranging from ~ -30 to +30 \u00b5mol kg -1 . These changes reflect natural carbon variations as well as secular anthropogenic carbon increases. A full global assessment of ocean DIC changes cannot be made until the resurvey of the oceans is completed in the next few years. However, a promising new approach for estimating C ant accumulation in the ocean was recently published by Khatiwala et al. (2009). Their approach is based on an inverse method to estimate the ocean's transport from observed tracer distributions together with an estimate of the spatiotemporally varying air-sea CO 2 disequilibrium based on the long-term record of atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. The latter, which is also constrained by surface ocean pCO 2 data (Takahashi et al. 2009b), provides a time-varying boundary condition that can be used to compute the C ant at any point in the ocean at any instant in time using the transport estimate. Khatiwala et al. have used this technique to reconstruct the spatially-resolved, time-dependent history of C ant and its air-sea flux between 1765 and 2008. By taking into account the changing air-sea disequilibrium of CO 2 and the complex advectivediffusive transport of tracers in the ocean, this approach overcomes some of the main limitations and biases of previous techniques. However, it does not account for potential changes in the fundamental processes controlling the distribution of natural carbon in the ocean such as variations in large-scale circulation, ventilation, or in the biological carbon pump. Figure 3.30 shows a map of the C ant column inventory in 2008 estimated using the method of Khatiwala et al. (2009). The first order patterns are very similar to those determined from the independent approach of Sabine et al. (2004) with the largest inventories in the North Atlantic, where the formation of deep waters move C ant into the ocean interior. Relatively large inventories are also associated with the subtropical convergence zone at approximately 40\u00b0S in the Southern Hemisphere. The total 2008 inventory estimated for the mapped region in Fig. 3.30 is 140 Pg C. Adding in the Arctic Ocean inventory as estimated by Tanhua et al. (2009) and the marginal seas using the same scaling function as Sabine et al. (2004) gives a total global ocean inventory of 151 Pg C. This estimate suggests a 33 Pg C increase in inventory since the Sabine et al. estimate for 1994 reflecting the continued uptake and storage of C ant at rates of 2.0 and 2.3 \u00b10.6 Pg C yr -1 for the decades of the 1990s and 2000s, respectively (Khatiwala et al. 2009). biospheric (i.e., terrestrial and aquatic) net primary production (NPP; gross photosynthesis minus plant respiration), and their photosynthetic carbon fixation is the primary conduit through which atmospheric CO 2 is transferred into the ocean's organic carbon pools. These tiny suspended ocean \"plants\" play a vital role on the Earth's biogeochemical cycles, and are the very base of the oceanic food chain. The productivity of phytoplankton depends on the availability of sunlight, macronutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorous), and micronutrients (e.g., iron), and thus is sensitive to changes in these resources. Since 1997, a continuous record of global satellite ocean color observations has been available, allowing the investigation of relationships between ocean environmental conditions and plankton ecology (e.g., McClain 2009; Behrenfeld 2010). The ecosystem property most often derived from ocean color data is surface chlorophyll concentration (Chl sat ) ( Fig.  3.31a). Chl sat provides an estimate of phytoplankton pigment concentration throughout the upper ocean mixed layer and its variability reflects the combined influence of phytoplankton standing stock (biomass) changes and physiological responses to prevailing light and nutrient levels. Values of Chl sat span three orders of magnitude globally (roughly 0.03 to >30 mg m \u22123 ) with a distribution closely aligned with primary ocean circulation features. Thus, high Chl sat is found in regions of seasonal deep mixing (e.g., North Atlantic) and upwelling (e.g., Equatorial Pacific, west coast of Africa), while low values are found in permanently stratified ocean regions, particularly the low-nutrient central ocean gyres (white contours in Fig. 3.31a). Climate-scale analyses require both continuity and consistency in the underlying observations for correct assessments of change. Unfortunately, these attributes are not satisfied for the most recent period of satellite ocean color measurements. Starting in 2008 and after more than a decade of continuous coverage, observations from the Sea-viewing Wide-Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) became intermittent due to issues with the spacecraft and telemetry. No SeaWiFS imagery was collected for the first 88 days of 2008 and, over the whole year, only 31 of 46 possible eight-day composite images could be processed. Data gaps also exist for 2009, with only 34 valid eight-day composites available over the year. Thus, 30% of the SeaWiFS record is missing for 2008/09 and only one-third of the eight-day composites are temporally matched for the two years. This lack of continuity strongly restricts an interannual comparison. Fortunately, half of the One advantage of the Khatiwala estimates is the ability to examine the changes in ocean carbon storage over time. For example, these estimates suggest that the annual rate of ocean carbon storage has grown every year since the late 1700s, but the rate increased sharply in the 1950s in response to faster growth in atmospheric CO 2 . In recent decades, however, the rate of increase in ocean carbon storage has not been able to keep pace with the atmospheric growth rate. The percentage of annual anthropogenic CO 2 emissions stored in the ocean in 2008 was as much as 10% smaller than the percentages of the previous decade, although significant uncertainties remain which preclude a more definitive statement. The rapid growth in emissions over the past 10 years relative to the previous decade is one important factor in the reduction in the ocean's relative uptake of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. Another key factor is the decreasing ability of the seawater to store the CO 2 as dissolved inorganic carbon. This reduced capacity is a natural and predictable consequence of ocean carbon chemistry that, in the absence of changes in large-scale circulation or ocean biology, will become more significant with time (Egleston et al. 2010). By comparing the Khatiwala estimates at the time and location of the repeat hydrography cruises the measured ocean carbon changes can be used to validate the C ant estimates and monitor for changes in the natural ocean carbon cycle not constrained by the Khatiwala technique. | coverage common to both years occurred at the end of the calendar year, providing two months of continuous coverage of the El Ni\u00f1o event developing over the latter half of 2009 (Chapter 4a). Consistency between available U.S. ocean color datasets is also a problem. In the State of Climate in 2008 report, we noted a relatively constant offset between the SeaWiFS Chl sat record and concurrent data from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) on the Aqua platform. Accordingly, we found reasonable agreement between temporal chlorophyll anomalies for the two sensors (Behrenfeld et al. 2009) [as in the current report, anomalies were calculated as the difference between an observed value for a given month and the average value for that month over a sensor's full record (e.g., 1997-2009 for the SeaWiFS)]. Unfortunately, discrepancies between Chl sat anomalies for the SeaWiFS (Fig. 3.31b) and MODIS-Aqua (Fig. 3.31c) increased during 2009, such that a simple offset correction is no longer adequate. The temporal evolution of this intersensor inconsistency is clearly revealed in the MODIS-SeaWiFS anomaly difference for the period 2004 to 2009 (Fig.  3.31d). While this issue of inconsistency has limited the current analysis of Chl sat changes to SeaWiFS data only, it is important to note that the full MODIS-Aqua dataset is currently being reprocessed by the NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group and preliminary comparisons between the SeaWiFS and reprocessed MODIS-Aqua scenes look excellent (see http:// oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/REPROCESSING/R2009/ for more details). Nevertheless, this experience emphasizes the critical importance of monitoring and updating ocean color sensor calibrations/algorithms and conducting periodic data reprocessing to achieve data quality levels adequate for satellite-based global climate studies. To investigate changes in global ocean chlorophyll stocks during 2009, available SeaWiFS data were analyzed following methodologies originally described in Behrenfeld et al. (2006) and employed in our two previous State of the Climate reports (Behrenfeld et al. 2008b(Behrenfeld et al. , 2009. Chl sat data (mg m -3 ) were integrated to the 1% light level to calculate \"photic zone\" chlorophyll concentrations (\u03a3Chl). For analysis of chlorophyll anomaly trends, global data were binned into three broad regions: the permanently stratified ocean (approximated as those waters with annual average SST > 15\u00b0C), strongly seasonal high-latitude northern waters (average SST < 15\u00b0C), and strongly-seasonal high-latitude southern waters (average SST < 15\u00b0C). For each region, \u03a3Chl data (mg m -2 ) were summed over surface area to give total chlorophyll stocks in units of teragrams (Tg = 10 12 g). Spatiotemporal variations in Chl sat are driven by variability in phytoplankton biomass, nutrient stress, and light acclimation (i.e., photoacclimation), all of which are linked to physical changes within the surface mixed layer. Changes in SST provide one index of this variability in the physical environment and can be compared globally to changes in Chl sat (Behrenfeld et al. 2006(Behrenfeld et al. , 2008a(Behrenfeld et al. , 2009. The relationship between phytoplankton chlorophyll and SST changes for the 2008 to 2009 period is best illustrated over the November-December period corresponding to the strengthening of the 2009 El Ni\u00f1o (Fig. 3.32). For this period, expansive and spatially coherent regions are seen of increasing and decreasing \u03a3Chl (Fig. 3.32a). In particular, \u03a3Chl decreased over much of the equatorial Pacific in response to lower nutrient levels associated with reduced rates of upwelling. In contrast, significant increases in \u03a3Chl are found in the western tropical Pacific, the south Pacific and Indian subtropical gyres and the equatorial Atlantic Ocean (Fig. 3.32a). These changes in \u03a3Chl correspond to similar spatial patterns in SST changes (Fig. 3.32b), again illustrating the close link between ocean biology and their physical environment. Overall for the stratified oceans, 63% of the pixels with increased SST for November-December 2009 also exhibited decreased in \u03a3Chl (yellow pixels in Fig. 3.32c). Likewise, 60% of the pixels with decreased SST corresponded to increased \u03a3Chl (light blue pixels in Fig. 3.32c). This dominant inverse relationship between SST changes and \u03a3Chl changes is consistent with surface-ocean warming (cooling) being associated with decreasing (increasing) vertical nutrient transport and increasing (decreasing) mixed-layer light levels, with light and nutrient changes driving changes in both phytoplankton cellular pigment levels and biomass. Relationships between global chlorophyll fields and SST illustrated in Fig. 3.32 are seen at a much broader level when cast against the full 12-year Sea-WiFS record for the three regions described above. For this comparison, monthly anomalies in regional SeaWiFS chlorophyll stocks were matched to SST anomalies constructed by merging MODIS-Aqua SST4 data (2003-09) and AVHRR (quality 5-8) SST data (1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)) (regionally-integrated SST data have units of \u00b0C m 2 and are hereafter referred to as \"thermal anomalies\"). Once again, an overall inverse relationship emerges at the regional scale for the full SeaWiFS record [ Fig. 3.33 -note that the thermal anomaly axes are inverted (i.e., cooling at top, warming at bottom)]. Indeed, the newly reprocessed SeaWiFS data provides an even closer match between thermal anomalies and chlorophyll anomalies than previously reported (e.g., compare to Behrenfeld et al. 2009). At high-northern | latitudes, chlorophyll and thermal oscillations were relatively constrained between 1997 and 2006 and then showed significantly stronger variability (Fig.  3.33a). As in previous reports (Behrenfeld et al. 2008b(Behrenfeld et al. , 2009, chlorophyll and thermal anomalies exhibited the largest temporal changes in the permanently stratified, lower-latitude oceans (Fig. 3.33b -note different axis scaling), with a large initial trend of increasing chlorophyll and decreasing temperature associated with the 1997-99 El Ni\u00f1o (Behrenfeld et al. 2006). From 1999 onward, an overall progressive decrease in chlorophyll is observed and coincident with a general increasing trend in ocean-surface temperature (Fig. 3.33b). At high southern latitudes, temporal trends in chlorophyll and thermal anomalies are weaker (Fig. 3.33c). While comparisons of surface chlorophyll and temperature data illustrate the strong dependencies of biology on physical forcings, it is important to recognize that the underpinnings of such relationships are correlative not causative. For each region, the full range in thermal anomalies represents an average change in SST that barely spans 1\u00b0C. The direct physiological consequences (e.g., enzymatic reaction rates) of such minute temperature changes are negligible. Thus, correlations between SST and chlorophyll anomalies emerge because SST acts as a surrogate for other environmental factors that covary with SST and directly impact phytoplankton chlorophyll levels. Two such factors are nutrient supply and mixed-layer light levels. In general, surface-layer warming is associated with stronger surface-layer stratification and shallower mixing depths, which in turn increase average mixed-layer phytoplankton light exposure and can hamper vertical nutrient exchange Siegel et al. 2005). Decreased nutrient availability suppresses phytoplankton cellular chlorophyll levels and can diminish phytoplankton biomass. Likewise, acclimation to enhanced mixed-layer light exposure entails reductions in cellular chlorophyll. Changes in seasonal surface mixing cycles can also influence chlorophyll levels by altering predator-prey interactions and thereby phytoplankton biomass and species composition (Behrenfeld 2010). Thus, it is the correlation between SST and the summed expression of these, and other, direct forcings that gives rise to inverse chlorophyll-SST relationships. It is essential that these functional relationships be carefully considered when interpreting observed global changes in satellite chlorophyll fields and when projecting observed changes to longer time-scale trends.  The year was characterized by a transition from waning La Ni\u00f1a conditions to a building El Ni\u00f1o, which developed in June and then strengthened to what NOAA's Climate Prediction Center (CPC) considers to be a strong episode. By December, SSTs were more than 2.0\u00b0C above average over large parts of the central and eastern equatorial Pacific from 175\u00b0W to 90\u00b0W. Overall global tropical cyclone (TC) activity during 2009 was the lowest since 2006, with six of the seven main hurricane basins (the exception is the Eastern North Pacific) experiencing near-normal or somewhat below-normal TC activity. The El Ni\u00f1o contributed to what is only the second below-normal hurricane season for the Atlantic basin since 1995 and at the same time contributed to a sharp increase in TC activity in the Eastern North Pacific basin which comprises both the eastern and central Pacific subregions. With the passage of the remnants of Hurricane Felicia that resulted in some significant rainfall and flooding, the state of Hawaii experienced its first TC since Hurricane Iniki in 1992. The Atlantic ITCZ was prominently featured in the news, as strong convective activity associated with it was cited as one possible factor in the tragic downing of Air France Flight 447 some 300 miles off the coast of Brazil in early June. In the Indian Ocean, the 2009 season had a neutral to weak Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) signal after an unprecedented threeconsecutive positive IOD signals from 2006 to 2008. This tropics chapter consists of six sections: (1) ENSO and the tropical Pacific; (2) tropical intraseasonal activity; (3) TC activity for the 2009 season in seven basins: the North Atlantic, eastern North Pacific, western North Pacific, North Indian and South Indian Oceans, Southwest Pacific, and Australia; (4) ITCZ behavior in the Pacific and Atlantic basins; (5) the IOD; and (6) TC heat potential, which, previously in the Oceans chapter, helps summarize the section for TCs from an ocean heat perspective."}, {"section_title": "b. ENSO and the tropical Pacific", "text": "and M. L'Heureux 1) Oceanic cOnditiOns ENSO is a coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomenon centered in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. ENSO features two opposing phases, El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a, which are responsible for considerable interannual climate variability in the global tropics and the midto-high latitudes. NOAA defines these ENSO phases using the Ni\u00f1o 3.4 index, which reflects area-averaged SST anomalies in the east-central equatorial Pacific between 5\u00b0N and 5\u00b0S and 170\u00b0W and 120\u00b0W. El Ni\u00f1o occurs when the three-month running mean value of the Ni\u00f1o 3.4 index (called the Oceanic Ni\u00f1o Index-ONI) is greater than or equal to +0.5\u00b0C; La Ni\u00f1a occurs when the ONI is less than or equal to \u22120.5\u00b0C. Both La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o occurred during 2009, with La Ni\u00f1a continuing during January-March (JFM) and El Ni\u00f1o prevailing from June through the end of the year (Fig. 4.1). December-February (DJF) in the 2008/09 season represented the second consecutive DJF period with La Ni\u00f1a conditions. During JFM, the weekly Ni\u00f1o 3.4 index ranged from \u22120.5\u00b0C to \u22121.1\u00b0C ( Fig. 4.1). La Ni\u00f1a ended abruptly in early April as SST anomalies increased rapidly, with anomalous warming continuing during April-June, leading to the development of El Ni\u00f1o in late June. El Ni\u00f1o remained weak through September. Rapid strengthening during October followed and the Ni\u00f1o 3.4 index more than doubled to +1.5\u00b0C. Additional strengthening occurred during November and December, with the Ni\u00f1o 3.4 index averaging +1.8\u00b0C during December. The ONI value for October-December (OND) reached +1.5\u00b0C, which the NOAA's CPC considers to be a strong episode. The anomalous seasonally-averaged surface and sub-surface temperature patterns associated with ENSO during 2009 are summarized in Figs. 4.2 and 4.3, respectively. During DJF, the equatorial cold tongue in the eastern Pacific Ocean was very welldefined and extended westward to the international date line (Fig. 4.2a). This feature was also stronger than average, with negative SST anomalies of \u22121\u00b0C evident in parts of the central and eastern Pacific (Fig. 4.2b). The pattern of sub-surface temperature anomalies during the period reflected an increased slope of the thermocline (thick black line) with positive sub-surface temperature anomalies and a deeperthan-normal thermocline in the western Pacific and negative anomalies and a shallower-than-normal thermocline in the east-central and eastern Pacific (Fig. 4.3a). These conditions are consistent with La Ni\u00f1a. During March-May (MAM), surface (Figs. 4.2c, 4.2d) and subsurface ocean temperatures (Fig. 4.3b) returned to near-average across the eastern equatorial Pacific. Beginning in April, periodic westerly wind bursts over the western Pacific initiated equatorial oceanic Kelvin waves (section 4c, Fig. 4.7). During both June-August (JJA) and September-November (SON) (Figs. 4.3c, 4.3d) these Kelvin waves were associated with a deepening of the oceanic thermocline in the central and eastern Pacific and with a corresponding increase in subsurface ocean temperatures. At the same time, positive SST anomalies developed across the central and eastern part of the basin as El Ni\u00f1o developed and strengthened (Figs. 4.2f,4.2h). Within the Ni\u00f1o 3.4 region, the dramatic increase in SSTs during October and early November was also associated with a strong oceanic Kelvin wave. By December 2009, SSTs were more than 2.0\u00b0C above average over large parts of the equatorial Pacific be-tween 175\u00b0W and 90\u00b0W, with the warmest total SSTs (> 30\u00b0C) centered near the international date line. 2) atmOspheric circulatiOn Although La Ni\u00f1a was short-lived and modest in amplitude, its impacts on the patterns of tropical convection and atmospheric winds were pronounced ( Fig. 4.4). For example, convection during DJF 2008/09 was suppressed over the central and west-central equatorial Pacific (brown shading) and enhanced over Indonesia and the far western Pacific (green shading). This pattern reflected a westward retraction of the equatorial convection toward the western Pacific and a disappearance of convection from the central Pacific. These conditions, combined with equatorial low-level easterly wind anomalies (Fig. 4.4a) and upper-level westerly wind anomalies (Fig. 4.4b), were associated with an enhanced Walker circulation typical of La Ni\u00f1a. Additional La Ni\u00f1a impacts were seen in the subtropics of both hemispheres, where upper-level cyclonic anomalies flanked the region of suppressed convection over the central Pacific.    This anomaly pattern featured a retraction of the mean subtropical ridges in both hemispheres toward the western Pacific. In the Northern Hemisphere, it also reflected a westward retraction of the East Asian jet stream and below-average jet stream winds east of the date line. These conditions dissipated during MAM as La Ni\u00f1a ended. El Ni\u00f1o developed during JJA and produced discernible impacts on the upper-level circulation (Fig. 4.5a) in a manner consistent with past episodes (Chelliah and Bell 2004). Prominent features of El Ni\u00f1o during this period included an anomalous zonal wave-1 pattern of 200-hPa streamfunction anomalies in the subtropics of both hemispheres. This pattern featured weak anticyclonic circulation anomalies over the central Pacific Ocean in both hemispheres and relatively stronger cyclonic anomalies extending eastward from the Americas to Australasia. Associated with this pattern, westerly wind anomalies between 30\u00b0S and 40\u00b0S reflected a strengthening and eastward extension of the mean wintertime jet stream over the South Pacific Ocean. Similar anomaly patterns were also evident during August-October (ASO), which led to a suppression of hurricane activity across the Atlantic basin (see section 4d2) and to stronger hurricane seasons in both the central (see sidebar article) and eastern Pacific (see section 4d3) sub-basins. El Ni\u00f1o impacts on the 200-hPa circulation were especially pronounced during OND (Fig. 4.5b), with well-defined anticyclonic anomalies evident in the subtropics of both hemispheres over the central equatorial Pacific. In the Northern Hemisphere, strong westerly wind anomalies over the North Pacific between 20\u00b0N and 30\u00b0N reflected a pronounced eastward extension of the East Asian jet stream and an eastward shift of the mean jet exit region toward the eastern Pacific. North of the jet, the typical El Ni\u00f1o-related pattern of cyclonic anomalies was also evident. Along with these impacts, the extratropical anomaly patterns during both October and December also reflected record negative phases of the Arctic Oscillation (AO). 3) ensO temperature and precipitatiOn impacts During DJF 2008/09 La Ni\u00f1a impacted global precipitation patterns in a manner consistent with past cold episodes (Ropelewski and Halpert 1989). These impacts included suppressed convection across the central equatorial Pacific and above-average rainfall across much of the Maritime Continent (Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, and Borneo), which extended to the northernmost portions of Australia (Fig. 4.4a). In addition, above-average rainfall was observed in northeastern Brazil. Similar anomalies were also observed during DJF 2007-08 in association with La Ni\u00f1a (L'Heureux et al. 2009). In the United States, La Ni\u00f1a contributed to drier than average conditions across the South during DJF 2008/09 and to increased precipitation in the northern Rockies and the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys. Temperatures over the United States were also generally consistent with La Ni\u00f1a, with below-average temperatures across the northern part of the country and above-average temperatures across parts of the South. By the end of the year, the patterns of precipitation typically associated with El Ni\u00f1o (Ropelewski and Halpert 1987) were observed over parts of the world. These included above-average precipitation in the central equatorial Pacific and southeastern South America and below-average precipitation in parts of Indonesia and the Amazon Basin. Enhanced storminess and precipitation were observed across the southeastern United States in association with the anomalous East Asian jet stream."}, {"section_title": "c. Tropical intraseasonal activity-J. Gottschalck and G. D. Bell", "text": "The MJO (Madden and Julian 1971, 1972, 1994) is a leading climate mode of tropical convective variability that occurs on intraseasonal time scales. The convective anomalies associated with the MJO often have the same spatial scale as ENSO, but differ in that they exhibit a distinct eastward propagation and generally traverse the globe in 30-60 days. The MJO can strongly affect the tropical and extratropical atmospheric circulation patterns and sometimes produces ENSO-like anomalies (Mo and Kousky 1993;Kousky and Kayano 1994;Kayano and Kousky 1999). The MJO is often quite variable in any given year, with periods of moderate-to-strong activity sometimes followed by little or no activity. Overall, the MJO tends to be most active during neutral and weak ENSO periods and is often absent during strong El Ni\u00f1o events (Hendon et al. 1999;Zhang and Gottschalck 2002;. The MJO is seen by continuous propagation of 200-hPa velocity potential anomalies around the globe. A time-longitude section of this parameter shows four periods during 2009 with MJO activity  (1) moderate activity during January (labeled MJO #1), (2) strong activity from mid-March to early May (MJO #2) (3) intraseasonal variability during July and August which partly reflected the MJO (MJO #3) and (4) strong activity from late October to mid-December (MJO #4). During the first half of January, a combination of the MJO and background La Ni\u00f1a conditions produced enhanced rainfall across Indonesia (indicated by negative velocity potential anomalies and anomalous upper-level divergence) and a stronger than normal South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) (not shown). During the remainder of January, very wet conditions were observed across portions of equatorial South America and Africa as this upper-level divergence shifted eastward (blue circles on Fig. 4.6). During April even stronger MJO activity produced anomalous upper-level divergence and increased tropical rainfall from the Indian Ocean across Indonesia into the western Pacific. From late July to mid-August, several forms of intraseasonal variability [including a faster propagating atmospheric Kelvin wave (Wheeler and Kiladis 1999;Wheeler and Weickmann 2001) and the MJO] contributed to an eastward shift of positive velocity potential anomalies and anomalous upper-level convergence from Indonesia to the central Pacific Ocean (Fig. 4.6, dashed blue circle). This shift acted to increase tropical activity in the Atlantic basin during an otherwise below average season, as demonstrated by development of TCs Ana, Bill, and Claudette (see section 4d2). This observation is consistent with past studies showing that conditions are more favorable for tropical development in the Atlantic basin when upper-level convergence prevails over the western Pacific Ocean to near the international date line and upper-level divergence dominates the western hemisphere (Mo 2000;Maloney and Hartmann 2000). A similar anomaly pattern during late October and early November was more clearly linked to strong MJO activity, which offset the El Ni\u00f1o signal and allowed for a rare late-season hurricane (Ida) to form over the Caribbean Sea; Ida was the only storm of the season to form in the Caribbean. Opposite patterns of anomalous velocity potential were evident during both July and September (red boxes in Fig. 4.6). During September, these conditions were associated with El Ni\u00f1o, and contributed to a significant increase in vertical wind shear over the Atlantic basin (Fig. 4.16b) and to suppressed Atlantic hurricane activity. The strong MJO activity during late October through early December also produced extratropical impacts. As the MJO shifted eastward across the western and central Pacific, the associated anomalous upper-level divergence and enhanced convection became superimposed upon the El Ni\u00f1o signal (Fig.  4.6, blue box) and acted to strengthen and extend eastward the East Asian jet stream. During mid-December, this jet stream undercut a persistent and strong upper-level ridge over western North America, allowing very wet and stormy conditions to affect California. Between August and December, significant intraseasonal variability was also evident across the Pacific Ocean in association with three equatorial oceanic Kelvin waves (Fig. 4.7). The first two of these waves were initiated in early August and mid-September, in response to westerly wind events operating on a faster time scale than that of the MJO. The second wave traversed the eastern Pacific Ocean during late October and November and produced exceptionally large increases in anomalous oceanic heat content. This wave also contributed to the rapid increase in SSTs in the Ni\u00f1o 3.4 region during late October (Fig.  4.1) and to large SST increases along the west coast of equatorial South America in early December. The third major Kelvin wave of the year was initiated over the western Pacific during December. This wave was triggered by a westerly wind burst linked to the MJO and reinforced the anomalously warm sub-surface waters in the central Pacific. From the standpoint of TC numbers, the 2009 season was above average in only one basin, the eastern North Pacific which comprises both the eastern and central Pacific hurricane subregions. The season was below average in the North Atlantic Ocean and near to slightly below average in the remaining five basins, which are the western North Pacific, the North Indian Ocean, the South Indian Ocean, the Southwest Pacific, and the Australian region El Ni\u00f1o's emergence in June led to only the second below-normal Atlantic hurricane season (along with 1997) since 1995. El Ni\u00f1o also contributed to a sharp increase in hurricane activity across the central and eastern North Pacific. The re-emergence of abovenormal activity in the Central Pacific sub-basin is highlighted in the chapter's sidebar article. Despite a well-below-average Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) Index value in the North Indian Ocean, the three systems that did make landfall ranked among the wettest ever observed in India and Bangladesh. For the Southwest Pacific the season had its latest start since 2001, with its first NS delayed until late January. Nonetheless, 2009 was that basin's most active season since 2006. 2) atlantic basin-G. D. Bell, e. S. Blake, T. B. Kimberlain, C. W. Landsea, R. J. Pasch, J. Schemm, and S. B. Goldenberg (i) Seasonal activity The 2009 Atlantic hurricane season produced nine NSs, of which three became hurricanes (Hs) and two became major hurricanes (MHs). The 1950-2000 averages are 11 NSs, 6 Hs, and 2 MHs. The reduced activity during 2009 reflected fewer, shorter-lived, and generally weaker storms compared to most seasons since the high-activity era for Atlantic hurricanes began in 1995 (Goldenberg et al. 2001). As a result, the ACE index (Bell et al. 2000) for 2009 was 60% of the median (Fig. 4.8), and approximately one-third of the seasonal average since 1995 (which is 165% of the long-term median). Based on NOAA's classification 2 , 2009 was only the second (along with 1997) belownormal Atlantic hurricane season since 1995. One NS (Claudette in the Florida Panhandle) made landfall in the United States during 2009, and Ida brought tropical storm force winds to the northern U.S. Gulf Coast before becoming extratropical prior to making landfall. Only one NS (Ida) formed in the Caribbean Sea, making landfall as a hurricane in Nicaragua before weakening to a tropical depression (TD) while crossing southeastern Honduras. Tropical Storm 3 (TS) Erika passed through the northern Caribbean Islands while weakening, and H Bill brushed Nova Scotia and Newfoundland (Cangialosi and Avila 2010). This represents a sharp decrease in the number of landfalling NSs compared to 2008, when the nations in and surrounding the Caribbean Sea were severely impacted by four NSs and four Hs, and the continental United States was struck by three NSs and three Hs."}, {"section_title": "(ii) SSTs", "text": "For the August-October (ASO) climatological peak months of the Atlantic hurricane season, SSTs were above average throughout the Main Development Region (MDR), defined as the Caribbean Sea and tropical Atlantic Ocean between 9.5\u00b0N and 21.5\u00b0N (Shapiro and Goldenberg 1998). The largest SST departures (+0.5\u00b0C to +1.0\u00b0C) were found across  the south-central and eastern MDR ( Fig. 4.9a). The ASO area-averaged departure for the entire MDR was +0.50\u00b0C, which is tied for seventh warmest since 1950 ( Fig. 4.9b). This warmth reflects three main factors: (1) the warm phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) (Enfield and Mestas-Nu\u00f1ez 1999), which accompanied the 1995 transition to the active Atlantic phase of the tropical multidecadal signal (Bell and Chelliah 2006); (2) reduced mixing and reduced evaporation from the ocean surface in association with weaker northeasterly trade winds (anomalous southwesterly flow) across most of the tropical Atlantic portion of the MDR (Fig. 4.10a); and (3) long-term trend (Santer et al. 2006). The reduced Atlantic hurricane activity during 2009, despite this anomalous warmth, is consistent with previous findings indicating that local atmospheric circulation anomalies, rather than local SST anomalies, are the dominant contributor to seasonal fluctuations in Atlantic hurricane activity (Shapiro and Goldenberg 1998;Bell and Chelliah 2006;Bell et al. 2006)."}, {"section_title": "(iii) Atmospheric circulation", "text": "A mixed set of atmospheric conditions, some favorable and some unfavorable to TC activity, prevailed during ASO. Favorable conditions included westerly wind anomalies at 1000-hPa and below average sea level pressure over large portions of the MDR (Fig. 4.10a). The core of the African Easterly Jet (AEJ) was also shifted approximately 5\u00b0 lat north of normal (black arrow, Fig. 4.10b), meaning the bulk of the African easterly wave energy (Reed et al. 1977) was often centered well within the MDR in an area of increased cyclonic shear (orange shading). This jet configuration favors stronger easterly waves and provides a cyclonic rotation to their embedded convective cells (Bell and Chelliah 2006). Unfavorable conditions included exceptionally strong vertical wind shear (blue shading, Fig.  4.11) and anomalous upper-level convergence (Fig. 4.12) over the Caribbean Sea. These conditions were linked to an anomalously strong and persistent Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough (TUTT, blue shading in Fig. 4.10c) over the Caribbean Sea. This TUTT produced a combination of anomalous upper-level westerly winds and low-level easterly winds (Fig.  4.13a) which increases the vertical wind shear. The TUTT also suppressed the normal rising motion so    that only weak ascent prevailed throughout the MDR (Fig. 4.13b). In addition to suppressing the overall hurricane season strength, these conditions acted to decrease sharply the number of landfalling NSs in 2009 compared to 2008. (iv) Links to global climate patterns The regional atmospheric conditions and Atlantic TC activity during 2009 largely reflected two competing climate factors: El Ni\u00f1o and the ongoing active Atlantic phase of the tropical multidecadal signal (Bell et al. 2009). Across the tropical Pacific Ocean, the 200-hPa velocity potential and divergent wind anomalies during ASO (Fig. 4.12) were consistent with El Ni\u00f1o, as was an overall zonal wave-1 pattern of 200-hPa streamfunction anomalies in the subtropics of both hemispheres (Fig. 4.14). This pattern reflected enhanced subtropical ridges over the Pacific  Ocean in both hemispheres, and weaker than average subtropical ridges throughout the remainder of the global subtropics. Over the Caribbean Sea, regional aspects of this El Ni\u00f1o signal included the enhanced TUTT, strongerthan-average westerly winds at 200-hPa, increased vertical wind shear, and anomalous sinking motion, all of which overwhelmed the ongoing multidecadal signal and suppressed the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season. These conditions are opposite to those observed during 2008, when the combination of the high-activity era and La Ni\u00f1a contributed to an above normal Atlantic hurricane season (Bell et al. 2009)."}, {"section_title": "(v) Conditions associated with the ongoing high-", "text": "activity era in the tropical Atlantic During the current high-activity era for Atlantic hurricanes, which began in 1995, two-thirds (10 of 15) of Atlantic hurricane seasons have been above normal, and only two have been below normal (Fig.  4.8). This elevated activity contrasts with the preceding low-activity era 1971-94, when one-half of the seasons were below normal and only three were above normal. During 1995-present, four of the five seasons not classified as above normal (1997, 2002, 2006, and 2009) can be linked to El Ni\u00f1o. The transition to the current high-activity era was associated with a phase change in the tropical multidecadal signal, which reflects the leading modes of tropical convective rainfall variability and Atlantic SSTs occurring on multidecadal time scales (Bell and Chelliah 2006;Bell et al. 2007). This signal highlights the convectively-driven nature of the atmospheric anomalies across the central and eastern MDR, and links them to an east-west oscillation in anomalous convection between western Africa (Landsea and Gray 1992;Goldenberg and Shapiro 1996) and the Amazon Basin. The combination of an enhanced West African monsoon and suppressed convection in the Amazon Basin was seen again during ASO (Fig. 4.12) and is known to be associated with an inter-related set of atmospheric anomalies typical of active hurricane seasons (Landsea et al. 1998;Bell et al. 1999Bell et al. , 2000Bell et al. , 2004Bell et al. , 2006Bell et al. , 2009Goldenberg et al. 2001;Bell and Chelliah 2006;Kossin and Vimont 2007). These anomalies include enhanced low-level inflow into the West African monsoon region (Fig. 4.10a) and enhanced upper-level divergent outflow from that region (Fig. 4.12). They also include stronger upperlevel ridges over both the eastern MDR and across the subtropical South Atlantic as seen in 2009 ( Fig. 4.14), along with a stronger tropical easterly jet at 200 hPa. Accompanying these conditions, the vertical wind shear (Fig. 4.15a) and 700-hPa zonal winds (Fig. 4.15b) in critical parts of the MDR have been much weaker since 1995 compared to the preceding low-activity era, and the 700-hPa relative vorticity has been cyclonic rather than anticyclonic across the southern MDR ( Fig. 4.15c). These latter two features were again present during ASO and are consistent with the more conducive AEJ described above. As discussed by Bell and Chelliah (2006) and Bell et al. (2009), the above combination of conditions means that tropical storms can develop within the MDR from amplifying African easterly waves moving within the region of below-average pressure and increased cyclonic shear along the equatorward flank of the AEJ. In the absence of El Ni\u00f1o, these waves are also embedded within an extended region of weak vertical wind shear, which enables further intensification as they move westward over progressively warmer SSTs. (vi) Intraseasonal variability in Atlantic hurricane activity During 2009 intraseasonal variability in Atlantic hurricane activity resulted from a combination of the MJO and an atmospheric equatorial Kelvin wave (see section 4c). For example, six NSs including both MHs formed during 11 August to 7 September, and the third H of the season did not form until early November. During these more active periods, the MJO contributed to anomalous upper-level convergence over the central equatorial Pacific (Fig. 4.6). In mid-August an atmospheric Kelvin wave also contributed to this anomalous upper-level convergence. These conditions resulted in a more conducive pattern of vertical wind shear across the tropical Atlantic (Fig.  4.16a) similar to that described (Mo 2000). In contrast, only two NSs formed during most of September and October, a period when El Ni\u00f1o dominated the 200-hPa divergence signal (Fig. 4.12). Particularly impressive is the exceptionally strong vertical wind shear during September across most of the MDR (Fig. 4.16b). 3) eastern nOrth pacific (enp) basin-D. H. Levinson, e. J. Gibney, J. Weyman, and M. C. Kruk (i) Seasonal activity The ENP basin is officially split into two separate regions for the issuance of warnings and advisories by NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS). NOAA's National Hurricane Center (NHC) in Miami, Florida is responsible for issuing warnings in the eastern part of the basin that extends from the Pacific Coast of North America to 140\u00b0W, while NOAA's Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) in Honolulu, Hawaii, is responsible for issuing warnings in the Central North Pacific region between 140\u00b0W and the international date line. In this section analysis summarizing the tropical cyclone activity in both these warning areas will be presented using combined statistics, along with information specifically addressing the observed activity and impacts in the Central North Pacific (CNP) region. The ENP hurricane season officially spans from 15 May to 30 November, although storms can develop outside of the official season, especially during El Ni\u00f1o enhanced hurricane seasons 4 . Hurricane and tropical storm activity in the eastern area of the basin typically peaks in September, while in the Central Pacific TC activity reaches its seasonal peak normally in August (Blake et al. 2009). Figure 4.17 shows the tracks of all of the observed TCs in the ENP and CNP in 2009. TC activity in the ENP started later than normal this past year, with the development of two systems in June (TD 01E during 10-18 June, and H Andres during 21-24 June), which was the first time since 1999 that no named storms formed during May. For the season as a whole, the number of NSs and MHs that developed were both slightly above their long-term means, while the number of Hs was  near-normal. Primarily due to the development of an El Ni\u00f1o warm event during the boreal summer and early autumn in the equatorial Pacific in 2009, the hurricane season was above average in the ENP basin, with 20 NSs, 9 Hs, and 5 MHs (Fig. 4.18a). These values are at or above the 1971-2005 averages for the basin (16.2 NSs, 9.1 Hs, and 4.3 MHs). Despite the overall above average activity in 2009 in terms of storm counts, the ACE Index (Bell et al. 2000;Bell and Chelliah 2006) was near-normal for the basin with a seasonal total of 106.1 \u00d7 10 4 kt 2 , which was slightly below the 1971-2005 mean (126.3 \u00d7 10 4 kt 2 ), but higher than occurred during the previous two seasons (Fig. 4.18b). A total of seven TCs were observed in the CNP region in 2009, three of which developed in the region and were officially named by the CPHC (TS Lana, TS Maka, and H Neki) 5 , while three others propagated into the region from the east (Fig. 4.17) crossing the warning area boundary of 140\u00b0W (MH Felicia, MH Guillermo, and TS Hilda). Three TCs reached hurricane strength in the CNP warning area, one of which developed into a major hurricane (Neki). This was the largest number of TCs in the CNP since 1997, and well above the 1971-2005 average of 4-5 TCs 6 . The enhanced activity in the CNP was also likely a result of the influence of the El Ni\u00f1o warm event that developed during the hurricane season, which generated more TC activity west of 140\u00b0W (see sidebar). Since 1995, the number of NSs in the ENP basin has been near average, fluctuating about the long-term mean (Fig. 4.18a). However, the numbers of Hs and MHs have been generally below normal in most seasons, with above normal activity having occurred in only three seasons. NOAA has identified 9 of the 15 seasons in the ENP as being below normal during 1995-2009, with only the El Ni\u00f1o-influenced seasons of 1997 and 2006 producing above-normal activity as measured by the ACE index. In contrast, enhanced activity was observed during the preceding 1970-94 period, which had 6 of 25 (24%) below-normal seasons and 9 of 25 (36%) above-normal seasons, as measured by the ACE index."}, {"section_title": "(ii) Environmental influences on the 2009 season", "text": "Seasonal TC activity (both frequency and intensity) in the ENP basin is influenced by several largescale environmental factors in the basin, including SSTs, the vertical shear of the horizontal wind, the phase of the ENSO phenomenon in the equatorial Pacific, as well as the phase of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) in the near-equatorial lower stratosphere (Gray 1984;Shapiro 1989;Whitney and Hobgood 1997;Hobgood 2003). ENSO is known to strongly modulate both the SSTs and vertical wind shear on interannual time scales in the ENP basin (Whitney and Hobgood 1997). However, multidecadal fluctuations in ENP hurricane activity are less well understood but do show a strong inverse relationship to the phase of the tropical multidecadal mode and Atlantic hurricane activity (Bell and Chelliah 2006;Wang and Lee 2010). Previous studies have documented that the occurrence of an El Ni\u00f1o typically favors an above-normal hurricane season, while La Ni\u00f1a (and neutral) conditions typically favor a below-normal hurricane season in the ENP (Irwin and Davis 1999;Frank and Young 2007;and Camargo et al. 2008). These ENSO impacts are modulated by the multidecadal signal, with the combination of a La Ni\u00f1a occurrence during an inactive hurricane era greatly increasing the probability of a below-normal season. During 2009, the transition from an ENSO neutral phase to an El Ni\u00f1o during the climatological peak of the hurricane season (ASO) resulted in above average SSTs (weekly and monthly SST anomalies of +0.4\u00b0C to +1.5\u00b0C) in the MDR 7 . Another significant environmental factor that likely enhanced the above-normal hurricane season in 2009 was anomalously below-average vertical wind shear between 200 hPa and 850 hPa in the MDR during the latter half of the hurricane season (Fig 4.19a). During the first half of the hurricane season (JJA), the wind shear anomalies were above average (exceeding 9-12 m s -1 ), which suppressed tropical cyclogenesis and inhibited intensification. Conditions changed considerably during the latter half of the season, when negative wind shear anomalies of 9-12 m s -1 were observed during SON (Fig. 4.19b). It is likely that the significantly weaker-than-normal shear late in the season enhanced TC intensification and as a result 2009 had an above average number of MHs in the ENP. The late season formation of MH Rick (15-21 October), which reached a maximum intensity of 155 kt Category (Cat-) 5 and was the second strongest ENP hurricane in the historical record (behind MH Linda in 1997, which had a peak intensity of 160 kt), as well as the development of MH Neki in the Central Pacific (18-26 October), were both indications of the weak wind shear during the peak months of the hurricane season. Several previous studies have shown statistically significant correlations between hurricane activity and the phase of the QBO (Gray 1984;Shapiro 1989;Whitney and Hobgood 1997). In the ENP basin, TCs have been shown to attain a higher intensity when the QBO is in its westerly phase, but there is also a corresponding decrease in the observed seasonal frequency (Whitney and Hobgood 1997). In June 2009, the phase of the QBO was westerly, as indicated by the zonally-averaged U-component winds at both 30-hPa and 50-hPa obtained from the NOAA CPC Climate Data Assimilation System (CDAS) dataset. In July, the zonal mean winds at 30-hPa shifted to easterly and remained from an easterly component for the remainder of the 2009 hurricane season. In contrast, the zonal winds at 50 hPa (not shown) remained from a westerly component for the entire hurricane season in the ENP. The effect of this split signal related to the phase of the QBO on the frequency and intensity of TC activity in the ENP is unclear. However, using data covering the 1963-1993 hurricane seasons, Whitney and Hobgood (1997) found that there are slightly fewer TCs over the ENP when the QBO is in its westerly phase, although these storms attained a slightly higher maximum intensity. Therefore, it is possible that the intensity of hurricanes in the ENP basin during the 2009 season may have been ehanced by the westerly phase of the QBO (based on the zonally-averaged wind at 50 hPa), as five major hurricanes formed during the season, which was the highest total since the 2006 season."}, {"section_title": "(iii) TC Impacts", "text": "Three TCs made landfall along the Pacific Coast of Mexico during the season (Cat-1 8 H Andres, Cat-2 H Jimena, and TS Rick). In comparison with climatology, the 2009 season was well above the 1951-2000 average of 1.34 landfalling TCs (Jauregui 2003). Along the Pacific Coast of Mexico, H Andres attained minimal hurricane strength (Cat-1 intensity) as it moved parallel to the coast in late June. Damage along Mexico's southwestern coast was minimal; however, heavy rains from Andres and its precursor disturbance flooded homes in a portion of Acapulco and resulted in the evacuation of about 200 people. Preliminary damage reports suggested that Andres was responsible for one fatality in Mexico. Strong winds and heavy rainfall from H Jimena caused devastation as the storm crossed the Baja peninsula on 2-4 September, officially making landfall with sustained winds of 85 kt (Cat-2). Strong winds and heavy rains associated with Jimena caused widespread damage on the central and southern Baja California peninsula. The cities of Ciudad Constituci\u00f3n, Mulege, and Loreto were reported to be hard hit, as well as many of the smaller towns near the track of the storm's center. One fatality was reported-a drowning due to flash flooding in Mulege, Baja California del Sur-and 75% of homes were damaged in Puerto San Carlos. Severe damage also occurred to the agricultural sector. Approximately 400 hectares of citrus was lost and 80 hectares of greenhouses were destroyed by the storm. Total losses to the sector have been estimated to be at least $37.3 million (U.S.), with damages to infrastructure estimated at $12.5 million (U.S.). On 21 October, TS Rick made landfall near Mazatlan with estimated maximum sustained winds of 50 kt, which was significantly weaker than the 155 kt the storm had reached at peak intensity. Preliminary reports suggested that Rick was responsible for two deaths in Mexico. In the CNP, Felicia reached a maximum intensity of 120 kt (Cat-4) before it weakened significantly as it moved into the Central Pacific sub-basin and affected the main islands of Hawaii as a tropical depression in mid-August. Impacts from Felicia included heavy rainfall and localized flash flooding. In October, the northwestern Hawaiian Islands were directly affected by MH Neki (Fig. 4.17, storm number 20), which caused the evacuations of researchers and scientists via a NOAA ship and a Coast Guard C-130 aircraft. Neki developed as a weak TC near 12\u00b0N, 130\u00b0W and slowly moved westward with little change in intensity. As it turned northwestward near 160\u00b0W, the system intensified, reaching a peak intensity of 105 kt (Cat-3). As its northern movement slowed, the storm crossed the archipelago near French Frigate Shoals and Necker Island as a strong TS (maximum sustained winds of 50-55 kt). 4) western nOrth pacific (wnp) basin-S. J. Camargo The 2009 season featured 28 TCs (including TDs) forming in the WNP. There were two (TS Maka and TD 02C) TCs which formed in the Central Pacific and crossed into the WNP. Of these 30 active TCs in the WNP, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency, nine additional TDs occurred in 2009. One of these TDs was named by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), which also named two other TDs (Bising and Crising) in the 2009 typhoon (TY) season. Twenty-five reached TS intensity (three of which were not named), 14 became TYs, and 5 reached supertyphoon (STY) intensity. In Fig. 4.20a the number of TSs, TYs, and STYs per year is shown for the period 1945-2009. The TC data used here is from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) best-track dataset for 1945-2008, and preliminary operational data for 2009, for the TCs forming in the WNP. Preliminary data for the storms forming in the Central Pacific region is from CPHC. Climatology is defined using the period 1971-2000. The 2009 WNP TC season (see Fig. 4.20) started in May, with TYs Kujira and Chan-Hom. These were followed by TY Linfa and TS Nangka in June. July TC activity was below normal, with only two TCs reaching TS intensity, TS Soudelor and TY Molave. On average for the month of July there are four NSs that develop, of which three reach TY intensity. In August, the TC activity was higher than in July, with three TSs (Goni, Etau, and Krovanh) and two TYs (Morakot and Vamco) forming in the WNP. In addition, two Central Pacific TCs, TS Maka and TD 02C crossed into the region. The most active month in TC genesis numbers was September, with one TD (Mujigae), two TSs (Dujuan and 18W), two TYs (Koppu and Ketsana), and three STYs (Choi-Wan, Parma and Melor) forming in the WNP. The seven NSs and three STYs that occurred in September tied the previous historical record of the number of NSs and STYs in that month. The TC activity in October was slightly below average, with one TS (Nepartak), one TY (Mirinae), and one STY (Lupit) occurring in the basin. The last STY (Nida) of the 2009 season formed in November, along with two TDs (24W and 27W) and one non-named TS (25W). The season finished with the formation of TS 28W in early December. The total number of TCs (30), NSs 25, and TYs (14) in 2009 were all below the median but equal to or above the 25th percentile of the climatological distributions (median: 30.5 TCs, 27 NSs, and 16 TYs, 25th percentile: 27 TCs, 24 NSs, and 14 TYs). The cumulative distributions of NSs (Fig. 4.20b) and TYs (Fig. 4.20c) show a slow season start, with the activity increasing in May, below-normal activity in July and August, and the high activity in September leading to slightly below-normal values for the season as a whole for NS and TY numbers. In contrast, the number of STYs in 2009 (five) was in the top quartile of the climatological distribution. The ACE in the WNP (Fig. 4.21) reflects well the activity and number of TCs. The ACE value for the 2009 season was very near the climatological median (Fig. 4.21a), only slightly above the median, due to the very low value of ACE in July, which was not totally compensated by the high October and November ACE values. The May ACE was in the top quartile of climatology and the November ACE was very close to the 75th percentile of the climatology. July and October were complementary months, with the July ACE value being the 5th lowest and the October ACE being the 5th highest value in the historical record for the respective months. The ACE values of the two strongest storms in 2009, STYs Melor and Nida are in the top 5th percentile of the historical record and the climatological distribution. Ninety percent of the ACE in November is due to STY Nida, while 64% of the September ACE is due to STY Choi-Wan, and 37% of the October ACE is due to STY Melor. There were 129 days with TCs and 122 days with NSs in 2009 in the WNP, both in the bottom quartile of the climatological distribution (medians 161.5 and 144.25 days, respectively). From these, there were 110 days with typhoons, slightly below the climatological median of 120.4 days. There were 22.25 days with intense TYs (categories 3-5), above the climatological median of 19.4 days. Climatologically, 74% (11%) of the TC days consist of days with (intense) TYs. In 2009 these ratios were much higher, 85.3% and 17.25%, respectively, pointing to a more frequent occurrence of intense and STYs in the 2009 TC season. The median lifetime of NSs in 2009 was 6.5 days, below the median lifetime of 8 days for all years. From the 25 NSs, 17 had a duration below the median, with 11 of those in the bottom quartile of the distribution. Only three TCs had a duration in the top quartile of the distribution, i.e., with lifetimes larger than 11.25 days, namely STYs Nida (11.75 days), Lupit (12.75 days), and Parma (17 days). STY Parma's very long lifetime of 17 days is in the top 2 percentile of the historical record. The El Ni\u00f1o event in 2009 occurred in three phases. From June to September, it was a weak event and then ramped up in October to a moderate event. In December it was declared a strong event. There is a known relationship between WNP ACE and ENSO, with high values of ACE usually occurring in El Ni\u00f1o years, when the TCs tend to be long-lived and more intense (Wang and Chan 2002;Camargo and Sobel 2005;Camargo et al. 2007b). The 2009 ACE reflects the time evolution and strength of the El Ni\u00f1o event in 2009. In the early TC season, while ENSO was still weak, low (July) or average values of ACE occurred. Once the ENSO event became stronger, the ACE values also increased, especially in October and November, due to the occurrence of the five super-typhoons in the late September to November period. The 2009 median lifetime was below normal, and with exception of TY Chan-Hom, all the storms that had an above-normal lifetime occurred after late September, when the El Ni\u00f1o became a moderate to strong event. There was a flurry of TC activity in late September, when the MJO was active in the region, right before the ramp-up of the El Ni\u00f1o event. This would be in agreement with the hypothesis, discussed in Sobel and Camargo (2005), that TYs could help strengthen El Ni\u00f1o events. Emanuel's genesis potential index (GPI) (Camargo et al. 2007a) shows (Fig. 4.22) clearly the shift in the environmental conditions from the early (JJA) to the late (SON) season to more typical El Ni\u00f1o-like conditions. While the GPI anomalies for JJA do differ from the El Ni\u00f1o JJA composite pattern, the SON anomalies are very similar to the El Ni\u00f1o SON composite. The mean genesis location (15.2\u00b0N, 140.5\u00b0E) in 2009 was shifted northwest of the climatological mean genesis positions (12.9\u00b0N, 143.5\u00b0E). While the mean track position (20.2\u00b0N, 134.9\u00b0E) is shifted slightly northward of the climatological mean (19.0\u00b0N, 134.2\u00b0E). These shifts are not consistent with the typical El Ni\u00f1o events, which tend to have a southeastward shift (Chan 1985;Chia and Ropelewski 2002). The late season (September to December) mean genesis position (14.2\u00b0N, 145.4\u00b0E) is more consistent with the typical shift in El Ni\u00f1o events. Fourteen WNP TCs made landfall during 2009, which is just below the 1951-2000 median of 15 9 . Six systems made landfall as a TD (median is three), seven made landfall as TS (median is six), one struck as TY (median is four), and none as an STY (median is zero). TY Morakot was a particularly catastrophic event for Taiwan, leaving 461 people dead and 192 others missing (most of whom were feared dead) with roughly $3.3 billion (U.S.) in damages. The storm produced record setting rainfall of 2777 mm, surpassing the previous record of 1736 mm set by TY Herb in 1996. The extreme amount of rain triggered enormous mudslides and severe flooding throughout southern Taiwan. One mudslide buried the entire town of Xiaolin killing an estimated 500 people in that village alone. The slow moving storm also caused widespread damage in China, leaving eight people dead and causing $1.4 billion (U.S.) in damages. Nearly 2000 homes were destroyed in the country and 136 000 more were reported to have sustained damage. The storm also caused severe flooding in the northern Philippines that killed 26 people. The Philippines were severely affected by the 2009 TY season. The PAGASA-named depressions in January, February, and May brought heavy rains and flooding in the eastern Philippines, mudslides on Cebu Island, and heavy rains with flooding in the western Philippines. These were followed by typhoons Kujira and Chan-Hom in May, which caused severe damage to crops, livestock, and infrastructure, as well as deaths in the country. In June, TSs Linfa, Nangka and Soudelor also affected the Philippines. More destruction and deaths were caused by TS Goni in July. In September, the Philippines were again affected by TYs Koppu, Ketsana, and Parma, the second bringing a record rainfall amount in Manila, while the latter made three landfalls in the Philippines. In October, TY Mirinae crossed the Philippines, and in November TD Urduja brought landslides to the southern part of Luzon."}, {"section_title": "5) indian Ocean basins", "text": "The NIO TC season typically extends from April to December, with two peaks in activity during May-June and November when the monsoon trough is positioned over tropical waters in the basin. TCs in the NIO basin normally develop over the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal between latitudes 8\u00b0N and 15\u00b0N. These systems are usually short-lived and relatively weak and often quickly move into the Indian subcontinent. However, strong and \"severe cyclonic storms\" 10 can develop with winds exceeding 130 kt (Neumann et al. 1993). The 2009 TC season produced five NSs, one cyclone (CYC), and no major cyclones (MCYC) (Fig.  4.23a). These values are near the 1981-2005 averages of 4.6 NSs, 1.4 CYCs, and 0.5 MCYCs. The season produced an ACE index value of 6.0 x 10 4 kt 2 , which is far below the 1981-2005 mean of 16 x 10 4 kt 2 (Fig.  4.23b). There is generally a reduction in tropical cyclone activity, especially in the Bay of Bengal, during the warm phase of ENSO (Singh et al. 2000), which the globe was transitioning to during the boreal summer 2009. During 2009, the monsoon trough set in relatively early (23 May). However, from 24 to 25 May, CYC Aila developed with peak winds of 65 kt in the Bay of Bengal and disrupted the normal northward ad-vancement of the monsoon. This resulted in severe drought conditions across the typical rainy areas of Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Himachal Pradesh. However, by 3 July, the monsoonal position had returned to near-normal ( Fig. 4.24). Despite the below normal rainfall from the monsoon trough, three NSs that made landfall in 2009 ranked among the wettest ever observed in India and Bangladesh. In India, CYC Aila killed 149 people and stranded tens of thousands of others because of the massive flooding that resulted. The eastern state of Meghalaya received 270 mm total rainfall from 25 to 26 May. In Bangladesh, CYC Aila resulted in 179 deaths from flooding and isolated over 400 000 people as numerous villages were submerged from floodwaters. Total rainfall from CYC Aila exceeded 130 mm near Chittagong, Bangladesh. This rainfall was particularly devastating, as it followed on the heels of NS Bijli (14-17 April), which produced an estimated 129 mm of rainfall over Bangladesh, according to the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), with maximum rainfall rates exceeding 50 mm hr -1 . Finally, from 9 to 11 November, NS Phyan developed just southwest of Sri Lanka and moved steadily north-northwest and then northeast until making landfall along the eastern coast of India near Maharashtra. NS Phyan produced extremely heavy rainfall of 820 mm over Tamil Nadu with peak winds near 50 kt. This total rainfall ranks second only to CYC Nisha, which produced 1000 mm across the same region from 25 to 29 November 2008. The SIO basin extends south of the equator from the African coastline to 105\u00b0E 11 , with most CYCs developing south of 10\u00b0S. The SIO TC season extends from July to June encompassing equal portions of two calendar years (e.g., the 2009 season is comprised of storms from July to December 2008 and January to June 2009). The peak activity typically occurs from December to April when the ITCZ is located in the Southern Hemisphere and is migrating toward the equator. Historically, the vast majority of the landfalling CYCs in the SIO impact Madagascar, Mozambique, and the Mascarene Islands, including Mauritius and R\u00e9union. 11 In order to generate consistent basin statistics, the SIO basin boundary overlaps with the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's operational warning area from 90\u00b0E to 105\u00b0E. The historical SIO TC data is probably the least reliable of all the TC basins (Atkinson 1971;Neumann et al. 1993), primarily due to a lack of historical record keeping by individual countries and no centralized monitoring agency; however, the historical dataset for the region has been updated (Knapp et al. 2010). The historical data are noticeably deficient before reliable satellite data were operationally implemented in the region beginning about 1983. The 2008/09 season produced 13 NSs and nearaverage numbers of CYCs (5) and MCYCs (3) (Fig.  4.25a). The 1981/2005 averages are 11.8 NSs, 6.4 CYCs, and 3 MCYCs. However, the 2008/09 ACE index (~70 x 10 4 kt 2 ) was below the 1981/2005 average ( Fig. 4.25b). With the exception of the 2001-02 season, no other season since the mid-1990s has produced an above average seasonal ACE in the SIO basin. The strongest CY during the season was MCYC Gael, which developed in the central Indian Ocean during the first few days of February 2009. As it moved southwestward, the center of circulation remained north of the Mauritius and Reunion Islands and slowly became more organized amidst the warm SSTs and weak upper-level wind shear and was declared a tropical cyclone on 3 February by JTWC. Gael quickly intensified just north and west of Reunion and became a MCYC on 6 February. Gael began to curve to the south and then east, missing a direct strike to Madagascar, and the storm remained at sea as it continued along a southeasterly direction and eventually dissipated. MCYC Gael reached peak strength of 120 kt and was responsible for two fatalities on Reunion Island. The strongest landfalling storm of the season formed in the Mozambique Channel in mid-January 2009 and remained quasi-stationary as it became better organized. By 18 January, Fanele became a tropical cyclone and intensified rapidly into a MCYC on 20 January with sustained winds of 100 kt. MCYC Fanele made landfall on the west coast of Madagascar on 21 January in the Menabe Region southwest of Morondava. Weakened severely by the interaction with the land, Fanele entered the Indian Ocean as a tropical depression and regained some strength before becoming extratropical. At least eight fatalities were reported as a result of MYC Fanele. Fanele's landfall occurred just two days after TS Eric brushed the eastern coast of Madagascar. The two CYCs impacted more than 50 000 people and left thousands homeless. 6) sOuthwest pacific basin-A. M. Lorrey, S. McGree, and J. Renwick Eight TCs occurred in the Southwest Pacific during the 2008/09 season, which was one less than the long-term average (1969/70 to 2007/08). This was the most active TC season for the region since 2005/06. The first TC formed on 28 January, which was the latest start to the Southwest Pacific TC season since 2000/01. Four systems developed into TCs west of the international date line and four TCs formed east of it. Peak activity occurred in March (four TCs), and December and February were unusually quiet. Only one TC reached hurricane intensity (sustained wind speeds of at least 64 kt). TC Hettie was the first to form in the southwest Pacific during the 2008/09 season and developed on 28 January to the southeast of Fiji. This system brought southerly winds and heavy rain to the central district of Fiji on 28-29 January before dissipating on 30 January. | formed in the northern sector before moving west), and one in the northern sector. There were four landfalls during the season. The most intense TC of the season was Hamish, which tracked south-east, parallel to the Queensland coast, from 5 to 11 March. It reached its maximum intensity on 7 March while near 19\u00b0S, 150\u00b0E (approximately 200 km offshore from Bowen), with estimated maximum gusts of 160 kt, maximum sustained winds of 115 kt, and a minimum central pressure of 925 hPa, making it the most intense cyclone observed 14 in the vicinity of the Queensland coast since 1918. It remained at Cat-4 or 5 intensity 15 for three days. While Hamish posed a substantial potential threat to the Queensland coast, it did not make landfall or approach the coast closely enough to cause any significant damage on land. However, two lives were lost at sea, and damage to a ship from the associated large waves resulted in a serious oil slick and coastal pollution in the Brisbane area. Four TCs made landfall during the season, the strongest being Cat-2. None caused significant damage through wind or storm surge, but all were associated with flooding. Billy made landfall near Wyndham, Western Australia on 20 December as a Cat-2 system, causing minor tree damage and widespread flooding through the Kimberley region. The system later reintensified as it moved back over the ocean and ultimately peaked at Cat-4 intensity (maximum gusts 135 kt, maximum sustained winds 95 kt, minimum central pressure 950 hPa) on 24 December, when north of Port Hedland and moving away from the coast. Two short-lived Cat-1 systems affected Queensland early in 2009. Charlotte made landfall near the Gilbert River Mouth, on the east coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria, on 12 January, while Ellie made landfall north of Cardwell, on the east coast, on 1 February. Both moved over areas that were already experiencing f looding and hence exacerbated conditions. The Herbert River catchment was severely affected, particularly around Ingham, which received 1481 mm of rain from 25 January to 9 February, including 949 mm from 30 January to 4 February. The heaviest daily total associated with the system was 497 mm at Hawkins Creek, northwest of Ingham. Early on 30 January, a tropical low formed in the Coral Sea region and intensified into TC Ellie, a Cat-1 storm, on 1 February. TC Ellie reached peak winds of 43 kt and made landfall in Australia on 2 February. Torrential rain from the dying end of this storm flooded parts of Northern Queensland and caused damages estimated at $110 million (AUS). TC Innes was the third to form in the southwest Pacific and initiated on 13 February as a tropical depression east of Fiji. On 17 February, after passing over Vanuatu and moving toward New Caledonia, Innes was upgraded to a TC. No significant impacts or loss of life were reported from this system. Subsequently, on ex-tropical transition, the dying remains of TC Innes merged with a low pressure system to the east of Australia that generated significant rainfall in northern New Zealand. Four TCs affected the southwest Pacific region during March. TC Hamish formed off the Australian coast in the Coral Sea on 5 March. TC Joni followed on 11 March, and formed near the Southern Cook Islands and attained a maximum intensity of 55 kt. Damage in the Southern Cooks from TC Joni was minimal. TC Ken then formed between Niue and the Southern Cook Islands on 17 March, attained a maximum intensity of 50 kt, and did not affect land areas. TC Jasper entered the southwest Pacific from the Coral Sea on 24 March with storm intensity and later passed through New Caledonia's waters, with no significant damage reported. Only one TC (Lin) formed in the basin during April. TC Lin formed on 4 April east of Fiji and passed over Tongatapu on 5 April. Sustained winds for Lin were estimated at 55 kt with gusts up to 80 kt closer to the storm's center."}, {"section_title": "7) australian regiOn basin-B. C. Trewin", "text": "The 2008/09 TC season was near normal in the broader Australian basin (areas south of the Equator and between 90\u00b0E and 160\u00b0E 12 , which includes Australian, Papua New Guinea, and Indonesian areas of responsibility). The season produced 10 TCs, equal to the long-term average. There were four TCs in the eastern sector 13 of the Australian region during 2008/09, five TCs in the western sector (one of which 12 The Australian Bureau of Meteorology's warning area overlaps both the southern Indian Ocean and Southwest Pacific. 13 The western sector covers areas between 90\u00b0E and 125\u00b0E. The eastern sector covers areas east of the eastern Australian coast to 160\u00b0E, as well as the eastern half of the Gulf of Carpentaria. The northern sector covers areas from 125\u00b0E to the western half of the Gulf of Carpentaria. The fourth landfalling system of the season was Dominic, a Cat-2 system (maximum gusts 75 kt, maximum sustained winds 55 kt, minimum central pressure 976 hPa) which made landfall near Onslow, Western Australia on 27 January. As for the Queensland systems, the principal impact was flooding, with daily rainfall totals of 243 mm at Thevenard Island and 238 mm at Onslow Airport. Of those TCs that did not make landfall, the most intense was Ilsa, which peaked at Cat-3 intensity (maximum gusts 125 kt, maximum sustained winds 90 kt, minimum central pressure 958 hPa) on 19 March when more than 1000 km off the Western Australian coast, near 16\u00b0S, 107\u00b0E."}, {"section_title": "e. TC heat potential (TCHP", "text": "Knaff, and I-I Lin TCHP is discussed here for the seven TC basins previously documented as a way to summarize that activity from a slightly different perspective. The TCHP, defined here as the ocean heat content contained between the sea surface and the depth of the 26\u00b0C isotherm, has been shown to be more closely linked than SST to intensity changes (Shay et al. 2000;Goni and Trinanes, 2003;Lin et al., 2008, provided that atmospheric conditions are also favorable. The TCHP shows high spatial and temporal variability associated with oceanic mesoscale features that can be globally detected with satellite altimetry TCHP (Goni et al. 2009). In general, the real-time forecast of TC intensity is highly dependent on track forecasts and many of the errors introduced in the track forecast are translated into the intensity forecast (Mainelli, et al. 2008). Clearly, areas with high values of TCHP may be important only when TCs travel over them. To examine the interannual variability of TCHP with respect to TCs, TCHP anomalies are computed during the months of TC activity in each hemisphere: June through November 2009 in the Northern Hemisphere and from November 2008 through April 2009 in the Southern Hemisphere. Anomalies are defined as departures from the mean TCHP calculated during the same months for the period 1993 to 2009. These anomalies show large variability within and among the TC basins (Fig. 4.26). The WNP basin exhibits the anomalies from the El Ni\u00f1o conditions, which have been in place in the equatorial Pacific Ocean since June 2009. Similar to the conditions during 2008, the South Pacific basin showed mostly positive anomalies. The NIO basin exhibited positive values in the Bay of Bengal and in the Arabian Sea. The Gulf of Mexico (Figs. 4.26, 4.27) showed mostly positive values except for a small region of negative values, which was probably due to a different location of the Loop Current. The tropical Atlantic exhibited mostly positive values, which is also observed in sea height and SST fields (http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/regsatprod/atln/ index.php). The ENP season was very active although the first named storm of the season did not develop until late in June, being the latest start of the ENP  (Fig. 4.28). This rapid rate of intensification occurred while traveling over a region of very high TCHP (above 70 kJ cm -2 ) and in a favorable atmospheric environment. This TC weakened as quickly as it intensified under the influence of strong upper-level southwesterly wind associated with an amplified short-wave trough (Cangialosi and Avila 2010). The WNP TY season was calmer than average in the early part of the season (June-August) but became very active during the later part of the season (September to November). During these three months, five Cat-4 and 5 TYs developed, as compared to two in 2008. This happened despite the general cooling tendency of TCHP due to El Ni\u00f1o (Figs. 4.26 and 4.27) in the western Pacific in 2009. Although the TCHP in the western Pacific decreased by about 10-15 kJ cm -2 with respect to the average conditions and to 2008 (Figs. 4.26 and 4.27), this was only a small decrease compared to typical TCHP values (Lin et al. 2008). In the WNP, especially between the 10\u00b0N and 20\u00b0N latitudinal belt, the TCHP values are typically around 100-160 kJ cm -2 (Lin et al. 2008). Therefore, even with a 10-15 kJ cm -2 decrease, the resultant TCHP in 2009 was still around 85-140 kJ cm -2 (Lin et al. 2008), sufficient to keep the TY's self-induced ocean cooling negative feedback small during the intensification . TY Nida was a Cat-1 storm on 24 November and intensified into a Cat-5 STY on 25 November, reaching peak winds of 160 kt, according to the preliminary JTWC best tracks. The track of this TY travelled from a region of high (~50 kJ cm -2 ) TCHP values to over a region of extremely high (above 100 kJ cm -2 ) values. The strength of this TY is also independently revealed by its large 10-minute sustained winds of 115 kt estimated at the same time in the final best track produced by RSMC Tokyo, the greatest intensity since TY Jangmi in 2008. However, the cooling produced by this TY was only of approximately 1\u00b0C, probably because of the very deep warm and stable surface layer (Fig. 4.28)."}, {"section_title": "f. Intertropical Convergence Zones (ITCZ)", "text": "1) pacific-A. B. Mullan There are two prominent convergence zones in the Pacific: the ITCZ in the Northern Hemisphere, lying approximately parallel to the Equator with a slight poleward tilt on its eastern end and varying in position from around 5\u00b0N-7\u00b0N in February-May to 7\u00b0N-10\u00b0N in August-November; and the SPCZ, which extends diagonally from around the Solomon Islands (10\u00b0S, 160\u00b0E) to near 30\u00b0S, 140\u00b0W and is most active in the November-April half-year. A southern branch of the ITCZ can also occur but is only apparent in the January-May period and is strongest in La Ni\u00f1a years.  degree resolution NASA TRMM rainfall data (3B-43 product, Huffman et al. 2007). The convergence zones are clearly evident in the transects over progressive 30-degree longitude bands across the Pacific, where the 2009 positions can be compared with the short 10-year climatology 1999-2008. TRMM data are also available for 1998; this year was omitted from the climatology due to the extremely unusual position of the convection on that year, although in fact the only noticeable effect of including 1998 would be to increase the rainfall along the equator east of the international date line during the first quarter of the year. La Ni\u00f1a conditions strengthened at the end of 2008, and during the first quarter of 2009 the convergence zones reflected typical La Ni\u00f1a characteristics, with the ITCZ and SPCZ both poleward of their climatological positions and suppressed convection evident near the international date line (Fig. 4.29 and the top panel of Fig. 4.30). Many islands of the southwest Pacific (Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, and southern Cooks) experienced above-normal rainfall during this season, with January being particularly wet in Fiji where many new rainfall records were set (ICU 2009). In February, the southern ITCZ appeared and remained prominent for the following two months until ENSO-neutral conditions were established. E N S O -n e u t r a l conditions continued through much of the second quarter of 2009, with the Pacific convergence zones mostly near their normal position and intensity. During this season, the SPCZ tends to contract so that by June on ly t he fa r western end nea r Papua, New Guinea is active; conversely, the ITCZ strengthens on its eastern end from 150\u00b0W eastward. In the western Pacific (150\u00b0E-180\u00b0), the ITCZ was weaker on its northern edge and resulted in persistent very dry conditions in the northern atolls of the Marshall Islands (PEAC 2009; Fig. 4.29 top right panel). El Ni\u00f1o conditions had established themselves by July but were initially weak. During the second half of 2009, the ITCZ east of the date line tended to be  equatorward of its normal position and often more intense (Fig. 4.29). In the OND quarter the SPCZ typically reintensifies, but this year the SPCZ was weak, with suppressed convection in the central portion of the southwest Pacific. Rainfall in the islands was very variable, but a number of islands (New Caledonia, Vanuatu, Fiji, Tonga, and French Polynesia) experienced some months of very low rainfall during this period. By contrast, enhanced convection occurred along the Equator west of the date line (Western Kiribati). Fig. 4.30 summarizes this typical El Ni\u00f1o rainfall pattern; the increased rainfall along a line from 5\u00b0S, 150\u00b0W to 20\u00b0S, 120\u00b0W appears very significant, but this band of stronger convection is at the very northeast edge of the SPCZ and the rainfall amounts are not very large. For 2009 as a whole, the TRMM data suggests rainfall was between 50% and 150% of normal over most of the equatorial and tropical Pacific (except in the far eastern sector south of the Equator), reflecting the influence of opposite ENSO phases during the year. 2) atlantic-A. B. Pezza and C. A. S. Coelho (i)Description The Atlantic ITCZ is a well-organized convective band that oscillates approximately between 5\u00b0N and 12\u00b0N during July-November and 5\u00b0N-5\u00b0S during January-May (Waliser and Gautier 1993;Nobre and Shukla 1996). As equatorial Kelvin waves can modulate its interannual variability, ENSO is also known to influence it on a seasonal scale (M\u00fcnnich and Neelin 2005). In 2009, the Atlantic ITCZ was influenced by ENSO and the Atlantic SST gradient between the Northern and the Southern Hemisphere. A transition occurred from a weak La Ni\u00f1a (January-March) to El Ni\u00f1o toward the end of the year, but the dynamic signature in the Atlantic was also very marked with a strong SST gradient toward the Southern Hemisphere during the first half of the year (warmer toward the south, Fig. 4.31a) changing into a reversed gradient pattern in the second half. As a result the ITCZ reached its southernmost position and maximum intensification in April and May, rapidly migrating back to the north from mid-June. The maximum intensification in May was accompanied by outbursts of severe convection facilitated by the ITCZ migrating into the core of the \"Atlantic warm pool\" with SSTs of the order of 30\u00b0C (Fig.  4.31b) and high values of CAPE producing positive rainfall anomalies over a large area of northeastern South America and adjacent ocean near the equator (Fig. 4.32a and b). (ii) Air France 447 disaster: Did the Atlantic warm pool play a role? These formations are not rare but are within the variability of an enhanced pattern intrinsic to years of very active ITCZ. It was unfortunate that a routine commercial flight between Rio de Janeiro and Paris starting its trip on the evening of 31 May (Brazilian time) crossed overnight an area of strong cumulus towers (cold tops) under development at about 3\u00b0N (Fig. 4.33), crashing into the ocean at about 0200 UTC on 1 June. The accident made headlines internationally and raised the question as to whether it is safe to fly over the ITCZ during very active periods. We note that there is no definite proof of causality between the behavior of the ITCZ and the plane crash, but evidence suggests that the weather was an influencing factor. The enhancement observed in May 2009 was a partial thermodynamic response to the large warm pool directly underneath the ITCZ coupled with the dynamic synergy of an already low static stability in the large scale due to the suppressed Kelvin wave propagation from the Pacific during a southern summer of weak La Ni\u00f1a, which would have established anticyclonic conditions over the area. The SST averaged over the Atlantic warm pool in May was the highest on record for the period from 1982 to 2009, suggesting a connection with the unusual enhancement observed (Fig. 4.31b)."}, {"section_title": "g.

Associated with its strong nonlinearity, positive IOD is usually more intensive and predictable than negative  "}, {"section_title": "S104", "text": "JULY 2010 | IOD. Following the three unprecedented consecutive positive IODs during 2006-08, SST anomalies in the tropical IO during June to November 2009 reflected a neutral-to-weak negative IOD condition (Fig. 4.34). SSTs in the eastern and western tropical IO were warmer than normal since April-May 2009, presumably due to more solar radiation reaching the sea surface associated with the dry conditions there (Fig. 4.34a). The nearly in-phase relationship between SST and rainfall anomalies in the western and eastern poles of IOD during 2005-08 was broken in 2009; SST anomalies in the two poles during 2009 appear to be driven by the atmosphere rather than a forcing of the convection anomalies. Correspondingly, zonal surface wind anomalies in the central equatorial IO showed no or less relationship with the west-east SST gradient during 2009 ( Fig. 4.34b). In contrast to the pronounced low-frequent variations and well-coupled conditions during 2005-08, the wind anomalies in 2009 were characterized by high-frequency f luctuations in response to active intraseasonal oscillations despite a tendency of strengthening easterly anomalies associated with the evolution of La Ni\u00f1a to El Ni\u00f1o in the Pacific. By adjusting the equatorial Walker circulation, ENSO evolution may largely influence the tropical IO climate, particularly in cases when the IO internal air-sea coupled processes are weak. The 2008/09 La Ni\u00f1a event caused more rainfall over the equatorial eastern IO and Maritime Continent during DJF; this cooled the local SSTs and induced westerly wind anomalies in the central-eastern equatorial IO (Fig. 4.35a). The westerly winds drove down-welling equatorial Kelvin waves and deepened the oceanic thermocline in the eastern IO and along the west coast of Sumatra-Java (Fig. 4.36a). An IO basin-wide cooling condition, frequently observed several months after La Ni\u00f1a peak, was however, not well developed in early 2009 (Figs. 4.35a and 4.35b). Warmer SSTs occupied the southwestern IO, northeastern Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal; this appears to be associated with deeper-thannormal thermocline in these areas (Figs. 4.36a and 4.36b). During March-May, warmer SST anomalies started to develop in the western equatorial IO owing to less cloud condition there (Fig. 4.35b). This is related to the La Ni\u00f1a influence and completely decoupled from the local cold subsurface signal (Fig. 4.36b). The cold subsurface signal in the western IO during December 2008 to May 2009 ref lected as eastward-propagating equatorial upwelling Kelvin waves and raised the thermocline in the eastern IO (Fig. 4.36c). Meanwhile, the original warm subsurface signal in the eastern IO reflected as a pair of westward-propagating downwelling Rossby waves and reached the west during JJA; this contributed to the rapid enhancement of the surface warming in the western equatorial IO (Fig.  4.35c). An off-equatorial warm Rossby wave at 10\u00b0S also propagated slowly westward from ~73\u00b0E to ~53\u00b0E during the period from December 2008 to November 2009 ( Fig. 4.36). However, it appears to have had little contribution to the western IO SST warming from March to November. Forced by more solar radiation associated with the less cloud condition, SSTs in the eastern IO became warmer than normal during June-August despite the local cold subsurface signal (Figs.  4.35c and 4.36c). The warmer SSTs generated a local Fig. 4.36. As in Fig. 4.35, but for the upper 300-m  wind convergence and deepened the thermocline in the eastern IO which in turn helped to intensify the surface warming (Figs. 4.35d and 4.36d). This led to a weak negative IOD index during September-November, in contrast to what has been often observed during El Ni\u00f1o developing years. The weak negative IOD condition may have caused more rainfall in the eastern IO and Maritime Continent and reduced the short rains in eastern Africa during the boreal fall season, which is counter to the remote influence of the developing El Ni\u00f1o. It is also possible that the eastern IO SST warming might have hampered the El Ni\u00f1o development during 2009 (Luo et al. 2010). The CNP, between 140\u00b0W and the international date line, is best described as a \"sub-basin\" of the ENP; no other analog exists in the other global TC basins. On average the CNP experiences four to five TCs per season (Blake et al. 2009). These are typically systems that have propagated westward from the ENP basin where they originally developed in the monsoon trough west of Mexico and Central America. However, every few years the CNP becomes more active for tropical cyclogenesis and storm formation occurs in situ within the sub-basin, well outside of the Main Development Region of the ENP. Therefore, the CNP is an unusual and transient region of TC activity, where the atmospheric and oceanic conditions can be termed \"enhanced\" or \"quiescent\" based on large-scale synoptic patterns typically associated with the ENSO phase (Chu and Wang 1997;Chu and Clark 1999;Chu 2002). The 2009 TC season was one such year when the CNP was in an enhanced phase, as seven TCs were officially tracked by NOAA's CPHC, with four of these systems developing within the sub-basin. The rarity of TC activity in the CNP has been known for a long time (e.g., Wann 1974;Chu and Wang 1997;Chu and Clark 1999), but improved monitoring due to satellite coverage since the late 1960s has allowed for a more complete picture of the historical variations of activity in the sub-basin. Figure  4.37 shows the time series of TC activity in the CNP in terms of all TC types (including TDs) since 1971. It is clear from Fig.  4.37 that the sub-basin experiences pronounced interannual and interdecadal variability in the frequency of TC occur-"}, {"section_title": "THE FORGOTTEN SuB-BASIN-THE CENTRAL NORTH PACIFIC (CNP) REEMERGES WITH A FuRY IN 2009-D. H. LevInSon", "text": "rences. Also plotted in Fig. 4.37 are the ENSO phases during July-October when the majority of TC activity occurs in the CNP. Since 1971, most of the enhanced TC seasons have occurred in conjunction with El Ni\u00f1o warm events, although there have been several notable exceptions, such as in 1978, 1985, and 1992. The CNP sub-basin also exhibits longer-term, multidecadal periods of enhanced and diminished TC activity similar to the ENP basin as a whole (and inverse to the North Atlantic; Wang and Lee 2010). Previous studies identified epochs of lower activity and higher activity associated with changes in the large-scale atmospheric and oceanic conditions, especially during the peak H season (July-September). Specifically, the period 1982-1994 is clearly an active epoch, one with warmer SSTs, lower mean sea level pressures, anomalously stronger low-level cyclonic vorticity, reduced vertical wind shear, and increased precipitable water content across the region (Chu and Clark 1999;Chu 2002). Despite the current quiescent period that began in 1995, enhanced TC activity has occurred in conjunction with El Ni\u00f1o events, which is an obvious concern for the Hawaiian Islands due to the increased probability of TCs developing and impacting the islands (Chu and Wang 1997;Chu and Wang 1998). With the development of an El Ni\u00f1o during the boreal summer, the 2009 season was clearly a more active one. Of note was the formation of MH Neki (Fig.  4.38) that reached Cat-3 intensity (peak winds of 105 kt), and was the first MH to develop in the sub-basin since 2006 (also an El Ni\u00f1o year). Therefore, the CNP sub-basin reemerged in 2009, which was the most active season in the region since the influence of the strong El Ni\u00f1o in 1997.  "}, {"section_title": "The ArcTic-J. Richter-Menge, Ed. a. Overview-J. Richter-Menge", "text": "The permanent presence of sea ice, ice sheets and continuous permafrost are defining features of the polar regions. The Arctic is further distinguished because it sustains a human population in a harsh environment. In this chapter we highlight observations that indicate changes and trends in the state of the physical components of the Arctic system, including the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice cover, land, and Greenland. In 2009 there continued to be widespread evidence of the impact of a general, Arctic-wide warming trend in surface air temperatures over land, evident since the mid-1960s. Significant regional and temporal variability was also widely apparent, tempering the dramatic evidence of warming reported in recent years (e.g., a record positive surface air temperature anomaly in 2008, record summer sea ice minimum extent in 2007, and record ocean surface temperature anomalies in 2007). Surface temperature anomalies (relative to a 1961-90 reference period) highlight the major feature of current Arctic conditions: an Arctic amplification of temperature anomaly of a factor of two or more, relative to more southerly latitudes. Below normal precipitation (with reference to the 1971-2000 base period) led the Greenland ice sheet surface mass balance in 2009 to be 25% to 50% less positive than normal, despite below-normal melting and runoff across much of the ice sheet below ~1800 m altitude. The 34 widest marine-terminating glaciers in Greenland lost 101 km 2 ice area in 2009, within a remarkably linear (R =-0.99) annual loss rate of -106 km 2 over the past decade. The 2008/09 Arctic snow-cover season marked a continuation of relatively shorter snow seasons, due primarily to an early disappearance of snow cover in spring. Observations show a general increase in permafrost temperatures during the last several decades in Alaska, northwest Canada, Siberia, and Northern Europe. Changes in the timing of tundra green up and senescence are also occurring, with earlier green up in the High Arctic and a shift to a longer green season in fall in the Low Arctic. The 2009 summer minimum sea ice extent was the third-lowest recorded since 1979. Surface ocean temperatures remained relatively warm and surface water was much fresher than in the 1970s. Linkages between the various elements of the Arctic systems continue to emerge. For instance, tendencies in the magnitude and distribution of upper ocean temperatures are observed to be strongly dependent on changes in the characteristics (e.g., pace and location) of the summer sea ice retreat and their effect on local atmospheric warming. The heat accumulated in the surface and near-surface layers of the ocean during the summer is then released back to the atmosphere in the following autumn, impacting temperatures in the lower troposphere. The coupling between the atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice has also impacted the overall characteristics of the Arctic sea ice cover, which is now dominated by relatively thin seasonal ice. The effects of the retreating sea ice also influence the temperature and vegetation of adjacent lands. Temporal analyses generally show that, within a specific region, periods of lower sea ice concentration are correlated with warmer land surface temperatures and an increase in the amount of live green vegetation in the summer. In the Eurasian river drainage basins, the correlation between river discharge and sea ice extent, over the period 1979-2008, is greater than the correlation between precipitation and runoff."}, {"section_title": "b. Atmosphere-J. Overland, M. Wang, and J. Walsh", "text": "The annual mean temperature for 2009 over Arctic land areas was cooler than in recent years, although the average temperature for the last decade remained the warmest in the record beginning in 1900 ( Fig.  5.1). The 2009 average was dominated by very cold temperatures in Eurasia in February (the coldest of the decade) and December, while the remainder of the Arctic remained warm (Fig. 5.2). The spatial distribution of annual temperature anomalies for 2009 has a pattern with values greater than 2.0\u00b0C throughout the Arctic, relative to a 1968-96 reference period (Fig.  5.3). These anomalies show the major feature of current Arctic conditions: a factor of two (or more) amplification of temperature relative to lower latitudes. As noted in the Arctic sea ice section, September 2009 had the third minimum sea ice extent relative to the period when observations began in 1979. Although 2009 did not have a record sea ice minimum in September, there were still extensive regions of open water in the Chukchi, East Siberian Laptev, and Kara Seas (see sea ice section below, Fig. 5.11), which allowed extra solar and longwave radiation to be absorbed by the ocean (see ocean section below, Fig.  5.5). This heat can be released back to the atmosphere the following autumn. This release of heat impacted temperatures in the lower troposphere (Fig. 5.4) with consequences for regional and far field wind patterns through horizontal gradients in the 500-1000 hPa thickness fields (Overland and Wang 2010). The year 2009 ended with record-setting negative values for the Arctic Oscillation (AO) index, a condition favoring meridional (north-south) atmospheric flow. Thus, December 2009 and early 2010 exhibited extremes in both warm and cold temperatures with record-setting snow across lower latitudes. Northern Eurasia (north of 50\u00b0 latitude to the Arctic coast)   and North America (south of 55\u00b0 latitude) were particularly cold (monthly anomalies of \u22122\u00b0C to \u221210\u00b0C). Arctic regions had anomalies of +4\u00b0C to +12\u00b0C. While individual weather events cannot be directly linked to larger scale climate changes, recent data analysis and modeling suggest a link between loss of sea ice and a shift to an increased impact from the Arctic on midlatitude climate (Francis et al. 2009;Honda et al. 2009). "}, {"section_title": "1) CirCulation", "text": "In 2009, the annual wind-driven ocean circulation regime can be characterized as cyclonic (counterclockwise), with a Beaufort Gyre that is significantly reduced in strength and a Transpolar drift that is effectively nonexistent (Fig. 5.5). This is the first time that an annual cyclonic circulation regime has been observed in the Arctic since 1997. The anticyclonic circulation regime that persisted through 2008 lasted at least 12 years instead of the typical 5-8 year pattern [as reported in Proshutinsky and Johnson (1997), who analyzed statistics of Arctic circulation regimes between 1948 and 1989]. The climatological seasonal cycle of the Arctic has anticyclonic ice and ocean circulation prevailing in winter and cyclonic circulation in summer. Since 2007, this seasonality has changed dramatically. In 2007, both summer and winter circulations were very strongly anticyclonic (Fig. 5.5, top panels) and resulted in the unprecedented reduction of the Arctic Ocean summer sea ice cover. In 2008, the winter circulation was anticyclonic but the summer circulation was unusual with a wellpronounced Beaufort Gyre and a cyclonic circulation cell north of the Laptev Sea (Fig. 5.5, middle panels). In 2009 (Fig. 5.5, bottom panels), the circulation reversed relative to climatology in both winter and summer: it was anticyclonic in summer (instead of cyclonic) and cyclonic in winter (instead of anticyclonic). These wind-driven conditions significantly influenced the characteristics of the sea ice cover, oceanic currents, ocean freshwater and heat content observed during 2007-09. 2) Water temperature and salinity Maximum upper ocean temperatures in summer 2009 continued to decline since the historical extreme in summer 2007 (Fig. 5.6). This tendency is strongly linked to changes in the characteristics (e.g., pace and location) of the summer sea ice retreat and their effect on local atmospheric warming (Steele et al. 2010, manuscript submitted to J. Geophys. Res.). Surface warming and sea ice reduction in the Canada Basin has also been accompanied by the widespread appearance of a near-surface temperature maximum at 25-35 m depth due to penetrating solar radiation (Jackson et al. 2010). As described in the Arctic atmosphere section, the heat accumulated in the surface and near-surface layers of the ocean can be released back into the atmosphere in the fall-a cycle that is likely to influence sea ice conditions in the future. S u r f a c el aye r w at e r s in the Arctic Ocean in 2009 r e m a i n e d much fresher t h a n i n t h e 1970s Tanis 1997, 1998). In t he Beaufor t Gy re , f re shwater content in 2009 (Fig.  5.7) was comparable to the 2008 freshwater conditions, with the exception of the southwest corner of the Canada Basin. In this region, the freshwater accumulation was increased relative to 2008 by approximately 0.4 km 3 under enhanced Ekman pumping and sea ice melt in this region. In total, during 2003-09 the Beaufort Gyre (Proshutinsky et al. 2009) has accumulated approximately 5000 km 3 of freshwater (from 17 300 km 3 in 2003 to 22 300 km 3 in 2009), which is 5800 km 3 larger than climatology of the 1970s Tanis 1997, 1998). Hydrographic surveys conducted in 2007-09 summer ( Fig. 5.7) in the Canada Basin indicate that in 2007 and 2008 there were two shallow temperature maximums in the upper Pacific water layer. However, in 2009, the heat content in this layer was reduced. Atlantic Water layer maximum temperature anomalies for 2007-09 ( Fig. 5.8) were calculated relative to the 1970s Tanis 1997, 1998;Polyakov and Timokhov 1994). The 2007-09 Atlantic Water layer data were derived from ship-based and Ice-Tethered Profiler (ITP) instruments. In 2007-09, the temperature anomalies were generally higher on the Eurasian side of the Lomonosov Ridge, reaching a maximum of up to 1.5\u00b0C along the Eurasian Basin boundaries. Warming was less pronounced in the Canada Basin. There was little to no temperature anomaly (<0.1\u00b0C) at the southeast boundary of the Canada Basin or in the basin boundary regions adjacent to Greenland and the Canadian Archipelago. Negative (cooling) temperature anomalies were detected in the vicinity of Nares Strait. Considering 2009 data alone, the warming pattern remained similar with the major difference being that maximum temperature anomalies along the Eurasian Basin boundaries were lower (<1.0\u00b0C). The characteristics of the Atlantic Water layer discussed above are regulated by the Atlantic water parameters in the Fram Strait (Fig. 5.9), where the Atlantic water inflows to the Arctic Ocean. After reaching a maximum in 2006, the temperature of Atlantic water in Fram Strait decreased until 2008. In 2009, Atlantic water temperature and salinity in the northern Fram Strait started to rise again, returning to their long-term means. The late winter of 2008 and early spring of 2009 were also characterized by a higher Atlantic water volume inflow with the West Spitsbergen Current as compared to 2005-07 ( Fig.  5.9). The Bering Strait is another important gateway to the Arctic Ocean. Preliminary analysis of mooring data from the Bering Strait does not suggest a repeat   of the very high heat fluxes from 2007 (Woodgate et al. 2010). Temperatures in 2008 were generally cooler than in 2007, reaching only 2\u00b0C-3\u00b0C in near-bottom temperature, compared to 4\u00b0C-5\u00b0C in 2007. Similarly, by the time of mooring turnaround in 2009, water temperatures were about a degree colder than the same month (August) in 2007. These cooler temperatures are more in agreement with temperatures of 2000-06 in the strait. An interesting change in ocean geochemistry was observed in the Canada Basin in 2008 and 2009. The input of sea ice meltwater, in combination with CO 2 uptake and global ocean acidification, caused the surface waters of the Canada Basin to become corrosive to calcifying organisms in the upper layer in 2008 (Yamamoto-Kawai et al. 2009). This is the first deep basin observation of aragonite undersaturation in surface waters. In 2009 the areal extent of surface waters unsaturated in aragonite, a form of calcium carbonate produced by marine organisms, increased. The increased stratification and decrease in upper-layer nutrient concentrations has also resulted in an increase in the number of picoplankton and a decrease in nanoplankton. Shifts such as these may alter the food web in the future (Li et al. 2009). 3) sea level Fig. 5.10 shows sea level (SL) time series from nine coastal stations in the Siberian Seas, having representative records for the period of 1954-2009 (Arctic and Ant arctic Research Institute data archives). In 2009, the SL along the Siberian coastline has significantly decreased relative to 2008. This caused a slight reduction in the estimated rate of SL rise for the nine stations over the period, to 2.57 \u00b1 0.45 mm yr \u22121 (after correction for glacial isostatic adjustment, GIA). The changing SL rise tendency may be due to the substantial change in the wind-driven ocean circulation regime (less anticyclonic, as de-scribed in section 5c1) and/or due to steric effects associated with the reduction of surface ocean warming and freshening rates (section 5c2). Ocean cooling and salinification both result in sea level decrease. Nghiem, and J. Richter-Menge 1) sea iCe extent Sea ice extent is the primary parameter for summarizing the state of the Arctic sea ice cover. Microwave satellites have routinely and accurately monitored the extent since 1979. There are two periods that define the annual cycle and thus are of particular interest: March, at the end of winter when the ice is at its maximum extent, and September, when it reaches its annual minimum. Ice coverage maps for March 2009 and September 2009 are presented in Fig.  5.11, with the magenta line denoting the median ice extent for the period 1979-2000. The March 2009 maximum ice extent was 15.2 million km 2 , the same as in 2008 and only 4% less that the 1979-2000 average of 15.8 million km 2 . On 12 September 2009 sea ice extent reached a 2009 minimum of 5.1 million km 2 . The 2009 summer minimum is the third-lowest recorded since 1979. It was 0.6 km 2 greater than 2008 and 1.0 km 2 above the record low in 2007 (an increase of 25% compared to 2007). Surface air temperatures through the 2009 summer were relatively cooler, particularly in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas. Winds in 2009 also tended to disperse the ice pack over a larger region. While the 2009 minimum extent was an increase over the two previous years, it was still 1.6 million km 2 (~10%) below the 1979 to 2000 average minimum. By December 2009 the ice extent had increased to 12.5 million km 2 , the fourth lowest December extent on record. This relatively slow recovery was due in part to a strongly negative Arctic Oscillation in the fall, an atmospheric circulation pattern that promotes meridional flow and relatively warm air temperatures in the Arctic. The time series of the anomalies in sea ice extent in March and September for the period 1979-2009 are plotted in Fig. 5.12. The anomalies are computed with respect to the average from 1979 to 2000. The large interannual variability in September ice extent is evident. Both winter and summer ice extent exhibit a negative trend, with values of -2.5% per decade for March and -8.9% per decade for September over the period 1979-2009. 2) sea iCe age and thiCkness The age of the sea ice is another key descriptor of the state of the sea ice cover, since older ice tends to be thicker and more resilient than younger ice. A simple two-stage approach classifies sea ice into first year and multiyear ice. First-year is ice that has not yet survived a summer melt season, while multiyear ice has survived at least one summer and can be several years old. Satellite derived maps of ice age for March of 2007March of , 2008March of , and 2009 are presented in Fig. 5.13. In the past decade, the extent of multiyear sea ice rapidly reduced at a rate of 1.5\u00d7106 km 6 per decade, triple the reduction rate during the three previous decades . Spring time multiyear ice extent was the lowest in 2008 in the QuikSCAT data record since 20 0 0 (Nghiem et al. 2007). QuikSCAT results in March 2009 showed a multiyear ice extent of 3.0 \u00b1 0 .2 million k m 2 . This was 0.3 million km 2 larger  Changes in ice age also have implications for the average ice thickness (Haas et al. 2008;Kwok 2007;Maslanik et al. 2007;Giles et al. 2008). Recent estimates of Arctic Ocean sea ice t h ick ness f rom satellite altimetry show a remarkable overall thinni ng of ~0.6 m between 2004 and 2008 ( Fig. 5.14a). Since the average thickness of the thinner first-year ice in midwinter (~2 m) did not exhibit a downward trend (blue line in Fig. 5.14a), the declines in total volume and average thickness (black line in Fig. 5.14a) are explained almost entirely by thinning and loss of multiyear sea ice due to melting and ice export. The total multiyear ice volume in the winter experienced a net loss of more than 40% in the four years since 2005 while the first year ice cover gained volume due to increased overall coverage of the Arctic Ocean. These changes have resulted in seasonal ice becoming the dominant Arctic sea ice type, both in terms of area coverage and of volume. In 2008, seasonal ice covered more than two-thirds of the Arctic Ocean. In Fig. 5.14b the recent satellite estimates (ICESat) are compared with the longer historical record of declassified sonar measurements from U.S. Navy submarines (Kwok et al. 2009;Rothrock et al. 2008). Multiple regression of the submarine data was used to separate interannual changes, the annual cycle, and spatial changes. Within the submarine data release area (covering ~38% of the Arctic Ocean), the overall mean winter thickness of 3.6m in 1980 can be compared to a 1.9 m mean during the last winter of the ICESat record in 2008, a decrease of 1.7 m in thickness. This combined submarine and satellite record shows a long-term trend of sea ice thinning over submarine and ICESat records that span three decades.   Fig. 5.15). Changes in MaxNDVI are much greater in North America (9% increase) than Eurasia (2%). Coherent temporal relationships between near coastal sea ice, summer tundra land surface temperatures, and vegetation productivity have been demonstrated using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)-derived 3g NDVI data (Pinzon et al. 2009, manuscript submitted to EOS, Trans. Amer. Geophys. Union;Bhatt et al. 2009, manuscript submitted to Earth Interactions). Absolute MaxNDVI changes are by far the greatest in the northern Alaska/Beaufort Sea area (0.09 AVHRR NDVI units), whereas the percentage changes have been highest in the Baffin Bay, Beaufort Sea, Canadian Archipelago, and Davis Strait areas (10-15% changes) ( Fig. 5.15). The changes in NDVI are positively and significantly correlated with changes in summer Arctic land surface temperatures. Yearly variations in summer land temperatures are strongly and negatively correlated with yearly variations in the summer coastal sea ice (Bhatt et al. 2009, manuscript submitted to Earth Interactions). These observations support model projections that the Arctic land surfaces should warm as a result of the reduced summer extent of sea ice (Bhatt et al. 2008;Lawrence et al. 2008) and furthermore indicate that tundra ecosystems are responding to the increased summer warmth. Changes in the timing of tundra green up and senescence are also occurring. Green up is earlier in the cold sparsely vegetated high latitudes, whereas a shift to a longer green season is occurring during the fall in the more continuously vegetated southern Arctic (Jia et al. 2009). These changes are evident through the analysis of NOAA AVHRR satellite data in the Canadian Arctic for the period 1982-2003. The greening trends observed in the satellite data are now supported by quantitative, long-term in situ vegetation measurements from the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) and the Back to the Future (BTF) projects. As in the satellite measurements, the most evident changes appear to be occurring first in the sparsely vegetated areas of the far North. A study of plots at Alexandra Fiord, Ellesmere Island, is the first to demonstrate significant changes in above and below ground biomass over the last 25-30 years (Hill and Henry 2010;Hudson and Henry 2009) (Fig. 5.16). In addition, there has been a change in the relative abundance of species with an increase in the dominant species over this same time period. The changes in the tundra plant communities are most likely in response to the increase in temperature over the past 35 years of between 0.6\u00b0C-1.0\u00b0C per decade, with the strongest increases seen in the winter temperatures. The increases in biomass also correspond with longer growing seasons, with extensions into the late summer and with deeper active layers (depth of summer soil thawing). In another far-north Canada study, repeat photographs of permanent vegetation study plots 46 years after their initial installation near the Lewis Glacier, Baffin Island, document rapid vegetation changes along the margins of large retreating glaciers (Johnson et al. 2009b; P. J. Webber and C. E. Tweedie 2009, personal communication). Further south, in the more lush tundra near Toolik Lake, a detailed analysis of a 20-year record (1989)(1990)(1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008) of tundra vegetation structure and composition from a set of 156 permanent monitoring plots indicates a general increase in above ground biomass (Gould and Mercado-D\u00edaz 2008). Over the last two decades the relative abundance of vascular vegetation increased by 16%, while the relative abundance of nonvascular vegetation decreased by 18%. The canopy height, as well as the extent and complexity of the canopy have been increasing over time with the amount of horizontal surface having multiple strata increasing from about 60% to 80%. The frequencies of landslides, thermokarst features (irregular land surfaces formed in permafrost regions by melting ground ice), and fires have been noted in several areas of the Arctic (B. Kokelj et al. 2009;Lantz 2008;Lantz and Kokelj 2008;Walker et al. 2009;Leibman and Kizyakov 2007;Ukraientseva 2008). Warmer soil temperatures, melting permafrost, more abundant water, and increased nutrients on these features result in their pronounced greening. In late summer 2007, the Anaktuvuk River fire near the University of Alaska's Toolik Lake Field Station burned almost 1000 km 2 . It is the largest known fire to occur in northern Alaska and offered an opportunity for detailed analysis of the changes to the tundra energy and nutrient balance (Liljedahl et al. 2007) and spectral properties (Rocha and Shaver 2009). The burning itself released ~1.9 million metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere, which was about 30% of the carbon stock within the vegetation and active layer of this area (M. C. Mack, unpublished data). Malkova, A. Kholodov, S. Marchenko Observations show a general increase in permafrost temperatures during the last several decades in Alaska (Romanovsky et al. 2002;Romanovsky et al. 2007;Osterkamp 2008), northwest Canada (Couture et al. 2003;Smith et al. 2005), Siberia (Oberman and Mazhitova 2001;Oberman 2008;Drozdov et al. 2008;Romanovsky et al. 2008), and Northern Europe (Isaksen et al. 2000;Harris and Haeberli 2003). Most of the permafrost observatories in Alaska show a substantial warming during the 1980s and 1990s. The detailed characteristic of the warming varies between locations but is typically from 0.5\u00b0C to 2\u00b0C at the depth of zero seasonal temperature variations in permafrost (Osterkamp 2008). However, during the last nine years, the permafrost temperature has been relatively stable on the North Slope of Alaska. There was even a slight decrease in the Alaskan Interior during the last three years. Only coastal sites in Alaska still show continuous warming, especially during the last three to four years (Fig. 5.17). Permafrost temperature has increased by 1\u00b0C to 2\u00b0C in northern Russia during the last 30 to 35 years. A common feature for Alaskan and Russian sites is more significant warming in relatively cold permafrost than in warm permafrost in the same geographical area. An especially noticeable permafrost temperature increase in the Russian Arctic was observed during the last three years-the mean annual permafrost temperature at 15m depth increased by more than 0.35\u00b0C in the Tiksi area and by 0.3\u00b0C at 10m depth in the European North of Russia. The last 30 years of increasing permafrost temperatures have resulted in the thawing of permafrost in areas of discontinuous permafrost in Russia (Oberman 2008). This is evidenced by changes in the depth and number of taliks (a layer of year-round unfrozen ground that lies in permafrost), especially in sandy and sandy loam sediments compared to clay. A massive development of new closed taliks in some areas of the continuous permafrost zone, as a result of increased snow cover and warming permafrost, was responsible for the observed northward movement of the boundary between continuous and discontinuous permafrost by several tens of kilometers (Oberman and Shesler 2009). 3) river disCharge-A. Shiklomanov Annual river discharge to the Arctic Ocean from the major Eurasian rivers in 2008 was 2078 km 3 ( Fig.  5.18). In general, river discharge shows an increasing trend over 1936-2008 with an average rate of annual change of 2.9 \u00b1 0.4 km 3 yr -1 . An especially intensive increase in river discharge to the ocean was observed during the last 20 years when the sea ice extent in the Arctic Ocean began decreasing. Interestingly, the correlation between Eurasian river discharge and sea ice extent over 1979-2008 is r = -0.72, or greater than the correlation between precipitation (Willmott et al. 1996) and runoff in these Eurasian drainage basins (r = 0.54). This suggests that both rivers and sea ice were responding to changes in large-scale hemispheric climate patterns (Shiklomanov and Lammers 2009). There is also an increasing tendency in river discharge to the Arctic Ocean from North America (Fig. 5.18) (Shiklomanov and Shiklomanov 2003;Rawlins et al. 2010). The mean annual discharge to the ocean over 2000-08 from the four large North American Arctic rivers was 6% (31 km 3 ) greater than the long-term mean from 1970-99. Official river discharge data are usually processed and published with some delay. This gap is related to discharge calculation techniques that take into account diverse f low conditions and ambiguous relationships between measured water stage (water level) and estimated river discharge. Cold regions with long periods of ice cover present the most difficult conditions for reliable discharge estimates in near-real time (Shiklomanov et al. 2006). However, in cooperation with Russian partners, we developed a method to estimate river discharge from the most important Russian monitoring sites in near-real time using provisional stage measurements and river ice data (http://RIMS.unh.edu). Provisional estimates for the 2009 annual river discharge to the Arctic Ocean from the six Eurasian rivers was greater than the long-term mean over 1936-2008 but much smaller than discharge in 2007 and 2008 ( Fig. 5.18). Taking into account that the provisional estimates over 2003-07 show a tendency to underestimate the annual observed values within an error of \u00b1 2-4%, we anticipate the total discharge of six largest Eurasian rivers in 2009 being in the range 1930-1970 km 3 ."}, {"section_title": "4) terrestrial snoW-C. Derksen, R. Brown, and L.

Characterizing Arctic snow cover with conventional observations is a challenge because the station network is sparse, biased to coastal locations (particularly in North America), and the measurements themselves are uncertain. For instance, point snow depth measurements are subject to local scale wind drifting or scour and may not represent the prevailing regional conditions. Even when they do, the large distances between stations does not allow for meaningful spatial interpolation (i.e., kriging), and coastal stations do not represent vast inland areas. Because of these limitations, both satellite measurements and modeling approaches are necessary to characterize the various parameters related to Arctic snow cover, including snow cover extent (SCE), snow water equivalent (SWE), SCD, and snowmelt timing/ duration. For the 2008/09 snow season, analysis of the NOAA snow extent data record derived primarily from optical satellite imagery (http://climate.rutgers. edu/snowcover/) showed a shorter-than-normal snow cover season across a large portion of eastern Siberia, with strong negative anomalies in the North American sector confined to the Canadian "}, {"section_title": "5) glaCiers outside greenland-M. Sharp and G.", "text": "Wolken (with data contributions from D. Burgess, J. G. Cogley, A. Arendt, and S. Luthcke) Mountain glaciers and ice caps are a major contributor to global sea level change (Meier et al. 2007). In the Arctic ice masses of these types cover an area of over 400 000 km 2 , representing 55% of the global glaciers and ice caps (excluding the ice sheets that cover Greenland and Antarctica). Although many of these glaciers lose mass by iceberg calving as well as by surface melt and runoff (Blaszczyk et al. 2009), the surface net mass balance (the difference between annual snow accumulation and annual runoff) is widely used as a measure of glacier response to climate variability and change. As measurements for the 2008/09 balance year are not yet available, we summarize measurements for 2007/08. These are available for 20 glaciers in Alaska (three), Arctic Canada (four), Iceland (nine) and Svalbard (four). Sixteen of the glaciers had a negative annual balance and four had a positive balance (two in Alaska and two in Svalbard). In addition, satellite gravimetry measurements reveal a regional annual net balance of -9 \u00b1 20 Gt yr -1 for Gulf of Alaska glaciers. Here, two glaciers located close to the coast had positive annual balances, reflecting heavy winter snowfall in winter 2007/08, while Gulkana Glacier in the Alaska Range had a slightly negative annual balance. In Arctic Canada, annual net balances were among the three most negative balances recorded in the 43-48 year record, likely due to the very warm summer in 2008, extending the period of very negative balances that began in 1987. The annual balances recorded in Iceland were slightly more negative than average (16-17 years of record), while those in Svalbard were more positive than average (20-42 years of record). Summer (JJA 2009) air temperature data (700 hPa level) and winter (September 2008-May 2009 precipitation data from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis provide indications of climatic conditions over the major glaciated regions of the Arctic in the 2008/09 mass balance year (Fig. 5.20; Table 5.1). Winter precipitation anomalies were positive (relative to the 1948-2008 mean) in Iceland and over the Alaska panhandle and adjacent areas to the north, and negative in southwest Alaska and southwest Svalbard. Summer temperature anomalies were strongly positive over southern Alaska, the Canadian Arctic and Svalbard, and very negative over Novaya Zemlya and Severnaya Zemlya. Melt season duration, and the dates of melt onset and freeze-up, on Arctic glaciers and ice caps were determined from 2009 backscatter time-series measured by the SeaWinds scatterometer on Qui-kScat ( Fig. 5.21; Table 5.1). In Arctic Canada, melt duration anomalies (relative to the 2000-04 average) were positive on all ice caps in the Queen Elizabeth Islands, with the largest anomalies occurring on the northernmost ice caps (N Ellesemere, Agassiz, and Axel Heiberg) despite later-than-average melt onset dates. Melt duration anomalies were also positive on Svalbard and slightly positive in southwest Alaska, mainly due to both early melt onset and late freeze-up in the eastern Alaska Range. Melt duration anomalies were strongly negative on north and south Baffin Island, due to very negative (early) freeze-up anomalies,  and on Novaya Zemlya, due to both very positive (late) melt onset and negative (early) freeze-up anomalies. Melt duration anomalies were also negative on Iceland and Franz Josef Land, and slightly negative on Severnaya Zemlya despite exceptionally positive (late) freeze-up anomalies. By comparing 2009 summer temperature, winter precipitation, and melt season anomaly patterns with both the anomaly patterns and measured mass balances for 2007/08, we predict another very negative mass balance year in Arctic Canada (but probably not as negative as 2007/08), and annual balances more negative than in 2007/08 in Alaska, Svalbard and Franz Josef Land, and more positive than in 2007/08 in Iceland, Novaya Zemlya and Severnaya Zemlya. f.

This \"North Water\" polynya is formed by some combination of ocean heat and winds. Ecologically, the North Water is known to be a wildlife \"bonanza\" for marine mammals, including narwhal and beluga whales. Strong winds and large atmosphere-to-surface temperature contrast result in tremendous ocean-to-atmosphere heat transfer, frazil ice, and saline deep water production. The sea ice consolidated into land-fast ice 500 km north of its typical position (Fig. 5.27) in the Lincoln Sea, far enough outside of the mouth of Nares St. that the normal strong winds that funnel through the strait (Samelson et al. 2006;Samelson and Barber 2008) allowed an \"ice bridge\" to persist all winter and into summer 2009.

This marked a continuation of a highly linear (R = -0.99) deglaciation trend (-104 km 2 yr -1 , Fig. 5.28)     The calendar year 2009 was relatively calm, climatologically speaking, for much of Antarctica, especially compared to the past two years which included ice shelf collapses juxtaposed with record-high sea ice extent. However, the total ice sheet melt during austral summer 2008/09 was the lowest of the 30-yr satellite record with no melt detected on the Ronne-Filchner and Ross Ice shelves, among other regions. In 2009, the polar atmosphere temperatures were persistently above average in the midto-lower troposphere during the winter. The latter half of the year was marked with short-lived anomalies lasting about one month. Nonetheless, the tropical El Ni\u00f1o event in late 2009 did influence Antarctica, particularly through ridging in the South Pacific. In turn, this created anomalous meridional temperature advection patterns that subsequently led to regional sea ice extent and concentration anomalies and decreased precipitation to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula. With the close of 2009 also comes the end of the first decade of the 21st Century. Although Antarctic climate records are much shorter than the rest of the globe, there were still many interesting and noteworthy occurrences during this last decade. A few of these are highlighted in Fig. 6.1, which shows annual and seasonal averages of the decadal mean temperature anomalies at Faraday/Vernadsky and Marambio, situated on the Western and Eastern Antarctic Peninsula, respectively, and the decadal mean Southern Hemisphere Annular Mode (SAM) index anomalies. Notable Antarctic climate events of the last decade include: \u2022 Observations indicate continued rapid warming of the Antarctic Peninsula. The warming on the western Peninsula is most marked during austral winter (June-August; Fig. 6.1a) while the warming on the eastern Peninsula is most marked during austral summer (December-February; Fig. 6.1b). The Peninsula warming trends are approximately five times larger than the global mean warming and are likely associated with anthropogenic greenhouse gas increases (Gillett et al. 2008). \u2022 Based on a statistical temperature reconstruction, West Antarctica has been warming at a rate of 0.1\u00b0C decade -1 over the last 50 years (Steig et al. 2009). \u2022 Based on surface observations, interior and coastal East Antarctica have remained stable during the last decade, with no significant warming or cooling trend (Turner et al. 2005).

Barreira", "text": "Antarctic large-scale circulation anomalies during 2009 based on the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis are examined throughout the troposphere-stratosphere (Fig. 6.2) and at the surface (Fig. 6.3). Because the high southern latitude reanalysis data quality improves drastically at the start of the modern satellite era (Bromwich and Fogt 2004;Bromwich et al. 2007), reanalysis data is used starting in 1979. Dividing the circulation anomalies into groups was particularly challenging for 2009, as many of the anomalies were weak and only lasted for a short time, especially during the latter half of the year. Nonetheless, both Figs. 6.2 and 6.3 indicate that the beginning of the year was dominated by below-average heights/pressures from the surface up to 10 hPa, accompanied by weakly positive circumpolar zonal wind anomalies and positive tropospheric temperature anomalies. The positive surface temperature anomalies were most marked in East Antarctica (Fig. 6.3b), and there was a notable negative surface pressure anomaly in the South Pacific Ocean during January-March (> 2 standard deviations below the 1979-2008 mean). The clockwise circulation about this low pressure anomaly increased warm-air advection to the Peninsula, making the temperatures higher there during the early part of the year (Fig. 6.3b). Furthermore, both the northeastern Weddell and Bellingshausen Seas were free of sea ice during January and February, which is consistent with the circulation and temperature anomalies presented in Figs. 6.3a,b. From April to August, comprising most of the polar winter, the above-average temperatures are seen throughout the Antarctic troposphere with positive pressure/height anomalies over the continent. This pattern was most marked in July, when temperature anomalies were > 2\u00b0C (from the surface up to 500 hPa; Figs. 6.2b and 6.3d) and more than two standard deviations above the 1979-2008 mean. Further, the positive height anomalies during this time period are matched with anomalously weak circumpolar zonal winds. Note, however, that the (SAM) index reached its lowest value for 2009 (-2.44) one month later, in August. Here the SAM magnitude is defined using the Marshall (2003) index, which is based on mean sea level pressure anomalies. Although the overall circulation anomalies were most marked in July, there was a one-month delay in timing of peak magnitude at the surface, clearly seen in the downward anomaly propagation from July-August in both geopotential height and circumpolar zonal winds (Fig. 6.2). The above average near-surface temperatures continued through austral spring (September-November, Fig. 6.2b). During the end of the year the SAM index was relatively weak and nonstationary, altering between negative and positive states. Examining the spatial surface pressure anomalies (Fig.  6.3e) reveals that the circulation pattern during the end of the year shows a distinct wave train from the Pacific to Atlantic sectors, resembling the Pacific "}, {"section_title": "S128", "text": "JULY 2010 | South American Pattern (Karoly 1989). Further, the spatial temperature anomalies from 180\u00b0W-0\u00b0 in Fig.  6.3f are readily explained by the ensuing meridional temperature advection changes resulting from the anomalous circulation. Of these, most notable was the strong positive pressure anomaly (>2.5 standard deviations) in the South Pacific, characteristic during El Ni\u00f1o events (Turner 2004). This circulation anomaly made the temperatures in the South America-Antarctic Peninsula region below average (> 2.5 standard deviations) and the central South Pacific above average (> 2.5 standard deviations) during the latter half of the year. The circulation anomalies are further examined and confirmed here using direct measurements of temperature, wind, and pressure at several manned and automatic weather stations across Antarctica. Fig. 6.4a displays the location of these stations. Two representative manned stations are displayed in Figs. 6.4b,c, and two automatic stations are displayed in Figs. 6.4d,e. A Google Earth file displaying the time series for each station described in this section can be found at: http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/ met/momu/BAMS/anomalies.kml. The base period for calculating the anomalies was 1979-2008 for the manned stations and 1980-2008 for the automatic weather stations. The temperatures in the northern part of the Antarctic Peninsula were below average for most of the year, with June, July, and August being especially cold at Bellingshausen and Marambio (Fig. 6.4c), although not breaking records. Further south on the Peninsula at Rothera station, the temperatures were slightly higher than average for most of the year. In the Weddell Sea region, the temperatures at Halley and Neumayer remained fairly close to the long-term average for most of the year, except for August, which was 3.5\u00b0C colder than average and October which was 4\u00b0C warmer than average. The pressures in August were much higher than average at Marambio (Fig. 6.4c; +14.8 hPa), Bellingshausen (+11.4 hPa), Rothera (+12.4 hPa) and Halley (+9.9 hPa), due to high pressure anomalies over the Weddell Sea (i.e., Fig. 6.3c). Around the coast of East Antarctica the temperatures at Mawson, Davis, and Casey were generally higher than the long-term averages, although these stations experienced below-average temperatures at  1979-2008 (1980-2008 for the AWS records). | these stations in April, August, and December. At the South Pole Amundsen Scott station (Fig. 6.4b) they recorded its warmest ever May temperature of -51.4\u00b0C, which was 2.0\u00b0C higher than the previous warmest value in 1981. They also recorded their highest annual mean temperature of -47.9\u00b0C, which was 0.1\u00b0C warmer than the previous warmest year of 2002. Records from automatic weather stations on the Ross Ice Shelf, West Antarctica, and the Polar Plateau were also analyzed. On the Ross Ice Shelf both Gill and Ferrell (Fig. 6.4e) reported record-high mean temperatures and record mean high wind speeds for April 2009, where Gill was around 10.0\u00b0C higher than the long-term April mean and Ferrell was 6.4\u00b0C higher. Marble Point, near the Ross Sea and McMurdo Station, reported a record high mean wind speed for April. In West Antarctica, Byrd station reported above-average temperatures in July, August, November, and December, as well as higher-than-normal pressure for April, July, August, and November, but no records were set. On the Polar Plateau, Dome C II (Fig.  6.4d) had a record high monthly mean temperature in July (7.5\u00b0C above the long-term mean). Possession Island, near Cape Adare at the northwest corner of the Ross Sea, also had a record high mean temperature for July (-17.0\u00b0C), and record high mean pressures for May and August (8.3 and 6.3 hPa respectively higher than normal), as reflected in Figs. 6.3c,d."}, {"section_title": "d.

Wang Earlier studies (e.g., Bromwich et al. 2004;van den Broeke et al. 2006) suggest that precipitation-minus-evaporation/ sublimation (P-E) closely approximates the surface mass balance over most of Antarctica, with precipitation being the dominant term at regional and larger scales. Precipitation and evaporation fields from the Japanese Reanalysis (JRA; Onogi et al. 2007) were examined to assess Antarctic snow accumulation behavior for 2009. The evaporation in JRA was calculated from the surface latent heat flux variable. In comparison to other long-term global reanalyses (e.g., NCEP1 and NCEP2), JRA has higher model resolution, both horizontally and vertically, greater observational usage, and a more advanced model configuration (Onogi et al. 2007). Figure 6.5 shows the JRA annual anomalies of P-E and mean sea level pressure (MSLP) for 2008 (Figs. 6.5b,d) and 2009 (Figs. 6.5a,c) to demonstrate the similarities and major differences between these years. In general, the annual anomalies over the high interior of the continent are small (within \u00b1 50 mm yr -1 ) in both years, consistent with the low amount of snow accumulation in this region. Most coastal regions in 2009 display much bigger P-E anomalies than during the previous year. The most negative P-E anomalies in 2009 can be observed to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula, in contrast to large positive anomalies over the Peninsula in 2008. In both years, the annual P-E anomalies are consistent with the mean atmospheric circulation implied by the MSLP anomalies (Figs.  6.5c,d).

Fig. 6.8c shows the temperature average (NCEP/ DOE reanalysis 2) for September at 50 hPa averaged from 60\u00b0S-75\u00b0S (edge of the polar vortex). The 2009 September period was near the 31-year average. The cold temperatures in the Antarctic vortex enable the formation of polar stratosphere clouds (PSCs), and these PSCs lead to the activation of reactive chlorine that rapidly destroys ozone as the sun rises over Antarctica. A fundamental process behind the formation of the ozone hole is the conversion of chlorine molecules from the nonreactive forms (HCl and ClONO 2 ) into ozone reactive forms on the surfaces of PSCs. This reactive chlorine then leads to rapid ozone destruction. The Calipso satellite provides an extremely highresolution estimate of PSC structure over Antarctica using lidar technology. Calipso observations show that, in terms of season-integrated totals, the 2009 season PSC volume was much less than the record 2006 season and was virtually zero by late September (update from Pitts et al. 2009). The Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on the NASA Aura satellite provides information on the chlorine monoxide (ClO) levels inside the Antarctic vortex. In 2009, the chlorine activation was quite high (consistent with high levels of inorganic chlorine from man-made chlorine containing compounds such as chlorofluorocarbons), but less intense, extensive, and persistent than in the last few years. The Antarctic stratosphere is warmed by the return of sunlight at the end of the polar winter and by large-scale weather systems (planetary-scale waves) that form in the troposphere and move upward into the stratosphere. During the 2009 Antarctic winter and spring, these planetary-scale wave systems were near average for the August-September period. Because the wave levels were near average in 2009, the September Antarctic stratospheric temperatures were also near average as can be seen in Fig. 6.8c. The 2009 ozone hole was relatively short-lived, with low ozone values disappearing by the end of November. Strong wave forcing in early October and in November caused a dynamically driven warming of the polar stratosphere. By late November into December 2009, lower stratospheric temperatures had risen above average (i.e., Fig. 6.2b)  This chapter provides a regional perspective of the global climate in 2009, with a focus on extreme or unusual events.

While this chapter covers the climate of 2009, information from the previous year may be included in order to accurately cover relevant climate events (e.g., descriptions of the austral summer and boreal winter seasons typically include data from December 2008). Extreme warmth was experienced across large areas of South America, southern Asia, Australia and New Zealand, while severe cold snaps were reported in the United Kingdom, China and the Russian Federation. Drought affected large parts of southern North America, the Caribbean, South America and Asia while heavy rainfall and floods impacted Canada, the United States, Amazonia and southern South America, many countries along the east and west coasts of Africa, and the United Kingdom. Descriptions of the background atmospheric state to local anomalies are found in Chapter 2. Similarly, descriptions of tropical cyclones may be found in Chapter 4. Seasonal summaries of temperature and precipitation are found in Chapter 8, and a global summary map is provided in Fig. 1.1."}, {"section_title": "b. North America", "text": "1) Canada-R. Whitewood and D. Phillips The year 2009 was another warm year in Canada (relative to 1951-80). It was also a drier-than-normal year after experiencing seven consecutive wet years."}, {"section_title": "(i) Temperature", "text": "The national mean temperature for 2009 was 0.8\u00b0C above normal (Fig. 7.1), which ties 1988 as the fourteenth warmest year since nationwide records began in 1948. The warmest year was 1998 (+2.5\u00b0C), and 1972 (-1.8\u00b0C) remains the coolest. Much of Canada's above-normal temperatures occurred in the North, where temperatures were more than 2\u00b0C above normal ( Fig. 7.2a). Overall, the rest of the country saw normal temperatures with the exception of southern Saskatchewan which experienced temperatures that were more than 1\u00b0C cooler than normal. The national annual mean temperature shows a linear increase of 1.4\u00b0C over the 62-year period (Fig. 7.1). In comparing the decades, it is clear that the 2000s was the warmest decade out of the six that are available for this national study, with an average temperature of 1.1\u00b0C above normal. In order, from warmest to coolest, the remaining decades are: 1990s (+0.7\u00b0C); 1980s (+0.4\u00b0C); 1950s (+0.1\u00b0C); 1960s (0.0\u00b0C); and 1970s (-0.2\u00b0C). Seasonally, three of the four seasons were warmer than normal. Winter was 0.3\u00b0C above normal (33rd warmest); spring was 0.4\u00b0C cooler than normal (14th coolest); summer was 0.4\u00b0C above normal (27th warmest); and autumn experienced the greatest above normal temperatures of the four seasons, 1.7\u00b0C above normal (third warmest autumn on record).\nFor the contiguous United States, the 2009 temperature very nearly tied 2008, which was the coolest since 2000 (Fig. 7.3). The spatial pattern consisted of cool anomalies in the northern and central U.S. Plains and Midwest, with warm anomalies in the Southwest and Florida (Fig. 7.4a). A persistent cool anomaly was entrenched in the U.S. Plains and Upper Midwest during the summer and fall periods. The decade long (2000-09) average annual temperature was 0.7\u00b0C above the twentieth century average. Over the past 30 years, the average temperature has increased at a rate of 0.4\u00b0C per decade. As with most winter seasons, December 2008-February 2009 featured regional variations in temperature but the overall average for the contiguous United States was \"near-normal,\" or within the middle third of historic winter temperatures. The warm anomalies strengthened in the spring (March-May), making it the 29th-warmest spring of the 115-year record. The warmer-than-average temperatures that were seen in the South and Southwest regions during the winter shifted to the West and Southwest regions during the spring. The contiguous United States experienced its 44th coolest summer (June-August). A recurring upper-level trough in the Central United States was associated with cool Canadian air, bringing belownormal temperatures to the central and northern Plains, Midwest, and Great Lakes areas. The cool anomalies peaked in July, when six states (Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia) experienced record cool temperatures for the month. It is noteworthy that an El Ni\u00f1o emerged during early summer 2009. Preliminary attribution exercises performed by NOAA scientists indicated that cooler-than-normal temperatures in the central United States during summer and early autumn are Fall 2009 was a season of extremes for the contiguous United States. While September was about 0.8\u00b0C above the long-term average, October was marked by an active weather pattern that reinforced unseasonably cool air behind a series of cold fronts, creating an average temperature that was 2.0\u00b0C below the long-term average and ranked the nation as the fourth coolest October on record. During this month, 43 of the lower 48 states averaged temperatures that were below normal. Florida was the only state with an above-normal temperature for October. The fol-lowing month was something of a mirror image, becoming the third warmest November on record, 2.2\u00b0C above the long-term average. Overall, the nationally-averaged temperature for the three-month autumn period was above-normal, ranking as the 34th warmest on record. The average annual temperature for Alaska in 2009 was 0.5\u00b0C below the 1971-2000 long-term average. This represents the second consecutive annual period in which Alaska has experienced cooler-thannormal temperatures. Seasonal anomalies contrasted the contiguous United States, with both winter and spring temperatures below average. The summer and fall seasons were warmer-than-normal as 500 mb height anomalies increased.\nIn general, M\u00e9xico registered an annual temperature anomaly in a range from -1.0\u00b0C to +1.0\u00b0C, which is considered a normal variation. With the exception of the Baja California Peninsula, northwestern, northern, northeastern, and western regions, as well as the Yucatan Peninsula, the anomalies were between 1.0\u00b0C and 2.0\u00b0C above normal (Fig. 7.6a). Annual mean temperature for the country as a whole was 22.5\u00b0C, with an anomaly of 1.0\u00b0C above normal. However, spatial and temporal variations were observed. During the winter, spring, and summer, anomalies from +1.0\u00b0C to +4.0\u00b0C were found in the northern, northwestern, western, and central regions of the country as well as in the Yucatan Peninsula. Recovering from the rainy season, at the end of August and beginning of September temperatures quickly decreased to normal in most of these regions, with the exception of the Yucatan Peninsula and the southeastern regions, where anomalies between 1.0\u00b0C and 2.0\u00b0C above normal remained. By the end of November and during December, unusually low temperatures prevailed in the northwestern, northern, western, and central regions of M\u00e9xico; in the states of the northern Gulf coast; and in the Sierra Madre Oriental and the Eje Neovolcanico regions. The anomalies were as much as 4.0\u00b0C below normal. This behavior was related to intense humidity from the tropical Pacific and its interaction with cold fronts; these conditions resulted in cloudier-thannormal skies, which led to low diurnal temperatures in most of the country.\nFor Cuba, 2009 was characterized by mean temperatures above the long-term average , resulting once again in a warm year. The annual mean of 25.9\u00b0C ranks 2009 as the 10th warmest year since 1951 ( Fig. 7.8a). This behavior was strongly influenced by an increase in extreme temperatures and high values reported in the summer. It highlights July, August, and September as the warmest since 1970. Also October 2009, where the values were 1\u00b0C above normal, was the warmest October since 1970. For Jamaica, slightly-above-normal temperatures were recorded for some coastal stations. This was observed against negative sea surface temperature anomalies around Jamaica for the first half of the year with a shift to positive anomalies for the latter half of the year.\nThe temperature and precipitation behaviors were mainly associated with the ENSO evolution during the second half of the year. The 2009 annual mean temperature anomaly was near +1\u00baC in Venezuela. In Colombia, the temperature was near normal during the first half of the year while a gradual increase was observed during the second half of the year with anomalies between +1\u00b0C and +3\u00b0C almost everywhere across the country. The stronger anomalies were found in September and December when historical maximum temperature records were registered. In Ecuador, the mean temperature was above normal in the first quarter of the year except for the central and northern Ecuadorian Andes. In Peru, the annual mean temperature was mainly near normal with an anomaly near +1\u00b0C in the east; however, several frosts occurred in the southern and central Andes zones in August and September.\nMost of tropical South America east of the Andes experienced a warm 2009 austral summer, with maximum temperatures 3\u00b0C to 4\u00b0C warmer than normal in the South American monsoon area in southeastern Brazil and in the coastal region of northeast Brazil. Likewise, warm summer conditions (1\u00b0C to 2\u00b0C above normal) were observed in central and eastern Amazonia and eastern Paraguay. In April, mean temperatures were about 3\u00b0C-4\u00b0C above normal over western Paraguay and northern Argentina, with maximum temperatures reaching 5\u00b0C higher than normal in Paraguay. Average temperatures during May were about 2\u00b0C above normal in central Amazonia, northern Paraguay and eastern Bolivia. In June, cooler-than-normal conditions (anomalies of -0.5\u00b0C to -1\u00b0C) were observed in southern and southeastern Brazil, and some sectors of western Amazonia, due to an episode of cold air intrusion. Maximum/minimum temperatures in southern Brazil were 2\u00b0C-3\u00b0C cooler than normal, and frost was reported in the elevated regions of southern Brazil. The cooling was also observed in Paraguay, where minimum and maximum temperatures were about 4\u00b0C and 1\u00b0C below normal, respectively. In July, cold temperature anomalies were detected in eastern Amazonia, northeast Brazil, southern Paraguay, and northern Argentina. Minimum temperatures were 3\u00b0C colder than normal in southern Brazil and in some regions of southeastern Brazil and western Amazonia and 4\u00b0C colder than normal in southern Paraguay. This cooling was due to a cold front penetration during late July. In the city of S\u00e3o Joaquim, state of Santa Catarina in southern Brazil, temperature reached -6.2\u00b0C on 24 July. Cold temperature anomalies also persisted over southern Paraguay. On the other hand, warm temperature anomalies (1\u00b0C-3\u00b0C) were detected in central and southeastern Brazil and over the Amazon region. In August, most of tropical South America east of the Andes was about 1\u00b0C-2\u00b0C warmer than normal. In September, the eastern coast of northeast Brazil was about 3\u00b0C warmer than normal, while the rest of the tropical region was 1\u00b0C-2\u00b0C warmer than normal. October temperatures across most of tropical South America were 1\u00b0C above normal, with the largest warming over Amazonia and southeastern Brazil. In November, temperatures were warmer than normal in southern and southeastern Brazil and western Amazonia. The largest warming was detected over northern Paraguay where the mean temperatures were 4\u00b0C-5\u00b0C warmer than normal. In December, temperatures in most of tropical South America east of the Andes were 1\u00b0C-2\u00b0C warmer than normal, especially over northern and eastern Amazonia and southeastern Brazil. In some regions of southeastern Brazil, temperatures were 4\u00b0C warmer than normal during the second week of December.\nIn Argentina and Uruguay, above-normal temperature was observed during austral autumn (MAM), with mean anomalies ranging from +0.5\u00b0C to +1.5\u00b0C. Anomalies from +2.0\u00b0C to +3.0\u00b0C in west-central Argentina during these months led to the warmest austral autumn over the past five decades. In contrast, the austral winter (JJA) brought cold conditions. For instance, the mean temperature in July was more than 3\u00b0C below normal in northeastern Argentina, southern Paraguay, northern Uruguay, and southern Brazil. July 2009 was the second coldest July of the past 50 years (after July 2007) for many locations in Uruguay and Argentina. In August, monthly mean temperature anomalies greater than +1.7\u00b0C were reported in northern Argentina and Uruguay, and anomalies greater than +1.4\u00b0C were found in November. During the spring (SON), positive anomalies were observed in the north and northwest of Argentina, where record high values were registered with respect to the last 50 years. In contrast, negative temperature anomalies on the order of -2\u00b0C characterized the climate of the Patagonia region during this season although the annual mean temperature remained from +0.5\u00b0C to +1\u00b0C above the climatological mean. In Chile, very large anomalies, both positive and negative, characterized the temperature regime during 2009. The daily maximum temperatures during the austral summer were well above the climatological average, with mean anomalies of +2.3/+3.0 standard deviations for January/March, defining new records since 1914 at Santiago (33\u00b0S) and since 1961 for the region between 33\u00b0S and 37\u00b0S ( Fig. 7.14). This behavior, associated with an anomalously intense subtropical anticyclone in the SE Pacific, persisted in the fall when anomalies close to +3.0\u00b0C were reported for the April mean daily maximum temperature in this region. In contrast, the 2009 austral spring (SON) was the coldest in the past 50 years in the region south of 37\u00b0S due to a large frequency of incursions of cold air masses from higher latitudes. This was particularly extreme during November, when anomalies from -2\u00b0C to -4\u00b0C were reported for the mean daily maximum temperature at stations between 35\u00b0S and 53\u00b0S, damaging the fruit ripening process in central Chile. Large parts of eastern Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and southern Brazil experienced a prolonged and intense drought during the first half of 2009, which caused severe damage to many socioeconomic sectors (agriculture, cattle farming, and hydro power generation). These conditions exacerbated the severe water shortage for the summer crops (soybean, maize, and rice) and pastures. In particular, in Uruguay the mean rainfall deficit reached -20% during January-June, with values of -39% reported for the stations of Salto and Melo. In northern and northeastern Uruguay, rainfall returned to normal conditions in September. Exceptionally wet conditions followed in November, when monthly rainfall reached 613 mm in Artigas and 540 mm in Rivera (more than four times the monthly average) (DNM 2009). This heavy precipitation explains the fact that, although all months from January to August were drier than normal, the year ended with a positive rainfall anomaly of +31% in Uruguay. In Argentina, the cumulative rainfall during 2009 was predominantly below the 1961-90 average. Deficits larger than -40% were observed in the Cuyo region, northeast of Patagonia, southeast of La Pampa, and north of Cordoba. In some cases the annual rainfall was the lowest since 1961. For example, the 369.1 mm measured at Pilar beat the previous record of 514.8 mm in 1962. Regarding anomalous wet conditions, above-average rains were registered in the northeast and east portion of the country (Iguaz\u00fa +142% and +Gualeguaych\u00fa 149%) and also in the extreme northwestern territory and southern Patagonia (Bariloche +130%). As in Uruguay, rains were markedly deficient in almost all the Argentinean territory until spring, giving continuity to an extremely dry period that had persisted since 2008, with important consequences for agriculture and livestock, water resources, and even some towns that had no water for consumption. In spite of the El Ni\u00f1o conditions that persisted in the equatorial Pacific since May 2009, winter (JJA) rainfall in central Chile was near the climatological average, although it was characterized by a considerable intraseasonal variability at the monthly scale with May, July, and September being anomalously dry and June and August being anomalously wet. On the other hand, large-scale circulation anomalies linked to El Ni\u00f1o contributed to rainfall anomalies above +40% that were observed in the region 39\u00b0S to 46\u00b0S during the spring (SON).\nIn northwest Africa (Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia), the annual mean temperature was mainly above normal in 2009, with the anomalies between +0.4\u00b0C and +2.5\u00b0C. Winter and autumn were exceptionally cold over the region with monthly mean minimum temperatures 0.1\u00b0C to 3\u00b0C below normal. January anomalies of -2.0\u00b0C and -2.2\u00b0C were found in Algeria and Morocco, respectively. Spring temperature Portions of northern Uruguay, southern Brazil and northeastern Argentina experienced significant positive precipitation anomalies during November (Fig. 7.15). Northern and western Uruguay, Rio Grande do Sul (state in Brazil), and Entre Rios (province in Argentina) felt the impacts of the flooding that affected all cities along the lower basin of Rio Uruguay River. Estimates indicated that more than 5000 people were evacuated from Uruguay alone. November 2009 was the wettest November in the last 30 years, since the Salto Grande dam was built (Fig. 7.16). Overall, more than 350 mm of rain felt in the region between 25\u00b0S-35\u00b0S and 50\u00b0W-60\u00b0W. The monthly average is 150 mm, but in some places the record exceeded 600 mm. The National Institute of Meteorology of Brazil (INMET) and the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) reported that the November precipitation surpassed 400 mm at 19 meteorological stations of Rio Grande do Sul State, and average rainfall in all states was about 300 mm above normal. In Sao Luiz Gonzaga, the rainfall was 640 mm while the historical monthly average was 154 mm, a record for November since observations began in 1912. juLY 2010 STATE OF THE CLIMATE IN | reached 1.5\u00b0C above average over most parts of Morocco; the temperature ranged from 7\u00b0C in the north to 23\u00b0C in the south. During the summer, exceptional heat waves occurred. The monthly mean temperatures exceeded the normal; for example, the anomaly was +2.4\u00b0C in Tetouan in July. On 21 July, the daily maximum temperature reached between 47\u00b0C and 50\u00b0C in the Saharien City, Maskara in Algeria, Agadir, Tiznit, and Tan Tan in Morocco (Fig. 7.17). In Egypt, 2009 can be described as a year with more stable and moderate weather than the previous years, with less temperature fluctuations and extreme events. For the 2000-09 decade, the annual mean temperature of Egypt remained above the normal by about 1.1\u00b0C. Fig. 7.18 shows a continued increasing trend from 1975. Only two years were below the average, 1982 and 1983. The warmest and second warmest years were 2008 and 2005 with anomalies of +1.9 and +1.7\u00b0C, respectively.\nFor South Africa, the annual mean temperature anomalies for 2009, based on 27 climatological stations, was about 0.4\u00b0C above the reference period . This made 2009 the 15th warmest year since 1961. Fig. 7.23 shows that the past 13 years were all above normal. For Zimbabwe, the temperatures were near normal with no records broken throughout the year.\nIn Comoros, the 2009 temperature was above normal every month with the exception of April when it was slightly below normal; the annual anomaly was +0.4\u00b0C. For Madagascar, the monthly mean temperatures were also near normal to above normal resulting in an above-normal annual mean temperature across the country (Fig. 7.27a). The highest monthly anomaly was +2\u00b0C observed in the northwest in October. The April temperature was also slightly below normal with a departure of -1.1\u00b0C in the south highlands. For the Republic of Mauritius, the 2009 temperature was above the 1971-2000 average by 1.0\u00b0C for Mauritius, 0.8\u00b0C for Agalega, and 0.6\u00b0C for Rodrigues islands. Every month stayed above normal at these locations except for Rodrigues when the temperatures were slightly below normal from July to September. For La Reunion, 2009 was the warmest year since 1970 ( Fig. 7.28) with an anomaly of +0.95\u00b0C (+0.84\u00b0C for minimum temperature and +1.07\u00b0C for maximum). Fig. 7.28 shows that the temperature has been above the 1971-2000 average for 10 consecutive years, with 8 of the warmest 10 years occurring in the last decade. For Seychelles, above-normal temperatures occurred every month with the exception of February. The annual anomaly was +0.6\u00b0C.\nMean annual temperatures in the Nordic Countries were above normal, with annual temperature anomalies ranging from +0.5\u00b0C to +1.5\u00b0C, except in the Arctic where they were higher. The highest positive anomalies were recorded in Svalbard, with mean temperatures 2\u00b0C-3\u00b0C above the 1961-90 average. In Iceland, Reykjavik reported its tenth warmest year since measurements commenced in 1870, while Denmark recorded its eighth warmest year since records began in 1874 with an anomaly of +1.1\u00b0C. Norway recorded a mean annual temperature anomaly of +1.0\u00b0C, ranking 19th since records began in 1900, with all seasons recording above-average mean temperatures. Throughout the Baltic countries, annual temperature anomalies also were around +1\u00b0C (Fig. 7.29). A very mild winter 2008/09 prevailed everywhere except in the western Nordic countries, though February was cold over most of Fennoscandia. The highest departures, exceeding +4\u00b0C, were observed on Svalbard and in Finland (Fig. 7.32a). Anomalies in Denmark were +1\u00b0C, which was less than in 2007 and 2008 when anomalies exceeded +4\u00b0C. Spring was exceptionally warm throughout most of the region (Fig. 7.32b). April was exceptionally warm (Fig. 7.34), with Denmark setting a new record mean temperature of 9.4\u00b0C, some 3.7\u00b0C above normal. In Norway, it was the third mildest April since 1900, with several stations in the South setting new monthly mean temperature records. In Sweden, April average temperatures were generally 1\u00b0C-4\u00b0C warmer than normal, and there were locations with monthly mean temperatures above 10\u00b0C, which has never occurred in Sweden during April since records began in 1860. The April mean temperature in Gothenburg was 10.4\u00b0C, beating former nationwide records. In contrast, April was the only month of the year with below-average temperatures on Svalbard (-3.7\u00b0C anomaly). In Longyearbyen, 22 April saw the coldest April temperature (-19.5\u00b0C) since 1993. Summer and autumn were at least slightly warmer than normal across much of the Nordic and Baltic region (Fig 7.32c,d), particularly during August. However, the beginning of June and July was exceptionally\nAnnual temperature anomalies over Eastern Europe ranged between +1\u00b0C and +2\u00b0C ( Fig. 29), with only northern parts of European Russia recording anomalies below +1\u00b0C. Parts of Romania exceeded anomalies of +2\u00b0C. Moldova experienced its second warmest year in history, beaten only by 2007. Unlike most of Western Europe, Eastern European countries experienced well-above-average temperatures during winter 2008/09 with anomalies surpassing +2\u00b0C (Fig. 7.32a). Spring temperature anomalies exceeded +1\u00b0C in western parts of Belarus, Ukraine, and Romania ( | 7.32b). April was particularly mild, although there was a 10 to 20 day frost period in the Ukraine, notably in eastern parts of the country. April was colder than normal in European Russia (Fig. 7.34). Temperature anomalies reached +3\u00b0C in the Ukraine during June and July, with a highest daily maximum temperature for the region of 40\u00b0C. Summer temperature anomalies exceeded +1\u00b0C in Romania and Moldova, while anomalies in European Russia (+0.5\u00b0C) and Belarus were closer to normal. Autumn was characterized by the extremely mild months of September and November throughout Eastern Europe, with temperatures generally above the 90th percentile of the 1961-90 distribution. These months contributed to a seasonal anomaly of over +1\u00b0C in Romania, Moldova, Belarus, western parts of Ukraine, and northern parts of European Russia, while the eastern Ukraine and southern European Russia had anomalies in excess of +2\u00b0C (Fig. 7.32d). December temperatures in Belarus differed greatly during the month. The beginning of the month was anomalously warm, with temperatures ranging from 5\u00b0C-10\u00b0C above average. On 2 December, several locations set new records for this day including Minsk, where temperatures reached 9.3\u00b0C, and Moscow (8.1\u00b0C), while in Moldova, it was the warmest night for a 2 December in the past 65 years. However the warmest day in Moscow in December 2009 was on the 6th, with 9.4\u00b0C. Remarkably, this value was measured in the early morning and was a local record high for December. In sharp contrast, temperatures plunged below -15\u00b0C in the middle of December in many parts of Belarus, with temperatures falling as low as -27\u00b0C. The city of Perm in European Russia (in the lowlands near the Ural Mountains) experienced temperatures as low as -41.4\u00b0C on 16 December, which was a new local record.\nWarmer-than-average conditions prevailed throughout the region during 2009. The largest anomalies were experienced in Israel, Cyprus, and the western parts of Syria and Kazakhstan, with values generally ranging between +1\u00b0C and +2\u00b0C ( Fig. 7.29). The largest positive temperature anomalies in winter 2008/09 were in the Caucasian countries (i.e., Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan) and Israel. On 9 February, temperatures above 30\u00b0C were recorded in parts of Israel, while between 13-16 February temperatures reached 20\u00b0C in southern Armenia. While spring and summer temperatures were well above average in Jordan, Syria, Israel, and Cyprus, S170 juLY 2010 | temperatures in western Kazakhstan, Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan were cooler than average. June 2008 and 2009 were the two warmest Junes in the last 40-50 years in Israel, due to several Sharav (hot winds from the Arabian Desert) events. Autumn temperature anomalies exceeded +1\u00b0C in Georgia and Azerbaijan and up to +2\u00b0C in western Kazakhstan. Israel experienced a very hot October with a monthly mean anomaly exceeding +3\u00b0C (1981-2000 base), primarily due to a six-day heat wave between 15-20 October, with successive days above 35\u00b0C in many places. December was unusually warm over the whole Middle East (+2\u00b0C anomaly or more), most notably during the second half of the month.\nThe mean temperature over China for 2009 was 9.8\u00b0C, 1.0\u00b0C above the 1971-2000 normal, the fourth warmest year since records began in 1951 and the 13th above average year since 1997. Annual mean temperatures for 2009 were above normal over most of China, with temperatures 1\u00b0C-2\u00b0C above normal in west and central east China. In contrast, some parts of the northeast and southern areas of South China recorded below-average temperatures for the year. Temperatures over China were above normal (based | on the 1971-2000 climatology) for all seasons, with anomalies of 1.7\u00b0C, 1.3\u00b0C, 0.6\u00b0C, and 0.6\u00b0C for winter, spring, summer, and autumn, respectively. The winter 2008/09 mean temperature was the third warmest, and the spring value second warmest, since 1951. The average surface temperature over Japan (averaged over 17 observatories confirmed as being relatively unaffected by urbanization) in 2009 was 0.56\u00b0C above the 1971-2000 average, making 2009 the seventh warmest year since 1898. Area-averaged annual mean temperature anomalies were +0.6\u00b0C in northern Japan, +0.7\u00b0C in eastern Japan, +0.6\u00b0C in western Japan, and +0.5\u00b0C in Okinawa/Amami.\nThe New Zealand national average temperature 2 for 2009 was 12.42\u00b0C, 0.16\u00b0C below the 1971-2000 normal (Fig. 7.53), consistent with the prevailing southwesterlies over the country during the year. Temperatures were generally within 0.5\u00b0C of the longterm average over most of the country. The exceptions were parts of Auckland, Waikato, Manawatu, southern Hawkes Bay, Wairarapa, Wellington, Marlborough, inland Canterbury, and eastern Otago, where annual temperatures were 0.5\u00b0C-1.0\u00b0C below average. The year was notable for two remarkably warm months (January and August) and a very warm spell in early February. Heat waves were experienced over the country 7-12 February, when northwesterlies transported some of the record-breaking Australian heat to New Zealand. Temperatures of 34\u00b0C or more occurred in many locations on each day in this period. Many new records of extreme high monthly maximum temperatures were established in January, February, and August. In contrast, New Zealand also experienced four extremely cold months (March, May, June, and October), and an extended frosty period across many parts of the country on 16-26 June. Many record-low monthly minimum temperatures were 2 http://www.niwa.co.nz/news-and-publications/news/all/ nz-temperature-rise-clear/seven-station-series-temperaturedata established in these four months, as well as numerous record-low daily minimum temperatures. The decade 2000-09 was the warmest in the instrumental record for New Zealand, with a 10-year average temperature of 12.69\u00b0C, 0.11\u00b0C above the long-term normal, just surpassing the previously warmest decade (the 1980s).\nAverage monthly maximum temperatures from January through June generally mirrored those conditions expected during moderate La Ni\u00f1a conditions and the transition to ENSO-neutral conditions. Average monthly maximum temperatures from January through June were generally typical of those expected during moderate El Ni\u00f1o events (Table 7.3). Average maximum temperature values at Yap were 0.53\u00b0C below normal (cooler and cloudier) for the first six months and 0.65\u00b0C above normal (warmer and clearer) for the latter half of the year as cloud systems developed farther eastward. Likewise, Pohnpei experienced January-June anomalies of +0.08\u00b0C and July-December anomalies of +.0.55\u00b0C, suggesting clearer and warmer conditions. Still farther east, maximum temperature anomalies at Kosrae for January-June anomalies were -0.74\u00b0C, reflecting both enhanced cloudiness from the boreal spring trade wind trough and enhanced cooling due to evaporation from the strong trade winds. The July-December temperature anomaly was -0.65\u00b0C, as the nearequatorial trough became established and produced persistent cloudy conditions. At the eastern end of the region, Majuro in the southern Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), had near-normal January-June average maximum temperature anomalies of +0.18\u00b0C and relatively normal July-December anomalies of +0.04\u00b0C. Average minimum temperatures in the RMI were generally warmer than normal during the year, reflecting warmer-than-normal SSTs in the region."}, {"section_title": "(ii) Precipitation", "text": "Overall, Canada experienced a drier-than-normal year in 2009 (2.6% below normal) and it ranked as the 10th driest year out of the 62-year period of record. Fig. 7.2b shows the south experienced most of the dry conditions. Regions that were more than 20% drier than normal were: British Columbia's west coast, eastern British Columbia, most of Alberta, small regions of Saskatchewan and Ontario, and Baffin Island. There were also regions that were at least 20% wetter than normal, including: southern Northwest Territories; central Nunavut; small areas of Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec; and the Atlantic provinces. Since the 1970s, precipitation across Canada has tended to be higher than the 1951-80 average. The wettest year on record, for the 62-year period of record, occurred in 2005 (13.4% above normal), and the driest was 1956 (7.3% below normal). Comparing precipitation by decades, the 1980s was the wettest decade at 4.2% above normal. The remain- Nationally, precipitation for each of the four seasons in 2009 was close to normal. Winter was right on normal with 0.0% (26th wettest); spring was the season with the greatest below-average amount of precipitation with -2.8% (22nd driest); the season with the greatest above-normal precipitation was summer with +2.2% (30th wettest); and autumn was -1.2% (21st autumn driest on record).\nThe rain pattern was variable during the year and across the country, but was generally very dry ( Fig.  7.6b). The year began much drier than normal in the winter and spring, but it changed to normal precipitation in the beginning of the rainy season (May-June). The first drought occurred in March and April and produced some impacts in the southern and southeastern states of the country. Thousands of livestock and hundreds of thousands of dollars U.S. were lost by the end of April, seriously impacting the economy of Tabasco. The development of the rainy season during May and June allowed the scheduled farming activities in most of the country; however, a new drought developed as a consequence of the fast appearance of El Ni\u00f1o. This drought episode hit agricultural, cattle, and water sectors in most of M\u00e9xico. Precipitation statistics ranked July 2009 as the driest since 1941 at a national level. Due to the devastating impacts, some farmer organizations in the central region of the country declared the event as the worst drought in 70 years. Precipitation recovered in the western, central, and southern areas of M\u00e9xico in the beginning of September, with an exceptionally wet autumn. However, the total annual precipitation reported by the National Meteorological Service was below normal (Fig. 7.6b). The largest negative annual anomalies were registered in Distrito Federal (-47.7%), Nayarit (-24.7%), Tabasco (-23.6%), Yucatan (-22.7%), Quintana Roo (-22.4%), Aguascalientes (-22.2%), Sinaloa (-20.0%), Estado de M\u00e9xico (-19.8%), Jalisco (-18.4%), Michoac\u00e1n (-18.3%), Veracruz (-16.8%), Morelos (-14.9%), Chiapas (-14.5%), Queretaro (-12.4%), and Chihuahua (-11.8%). Only five of the 32 states of Mexico reported rainfall above normal: Baja California Sur (+69.6%), Baja California (+26.6%), Hidalgo (+11.3%), Zacatecas (+6.7%), and Sonora (+4.5%).\nThe year was generally drier-than-normal for three of the seven stations analyzed: Phillip Goldson A. (Belize), Puerto Lempira (Honduras), and Liberia (Costa Rica). None of these sites show dry conditions exceeding the 95% confidence level with respect to the mean. In terms of the starting and ending dates (SD and ED) of the rainy season, there is a general tendency for 2009 being a year with late SDs when compared to both the baseline period and 2000-09 average. Also, the 2009 rainy season had an early ED for Liberia, compared to the averages for 1971-2000 and 2000-09, while Choluteca shows an early ED compared to 1971-2000 but a late ED compared to 2000-09. David behaves in an opposite way to Choluteca. These variabilities suggest more local than regional physical mechanisms controlling precipitation. The number of five-day rainy events (pentads) during 2009 was lower than average in six of the seven stations analyzed. The exception was Puerto Limon (Costa Rica). Conversely, the 2009 number of dry pentads was higher than normal for four of the seven stations analyzed (Phillip Goldson, Puerto Lempira, Liberia, and San Jose), while Choluteca and David were lower than normal and Puerto Limon was about average. The interquartile range (IQR, a measure of variability for the pentad data) was about average in all stations, except for San Jose. Finally, the number of wet outliers was lower than normal for San Jose, Lempira, Choluteca, David, and Liberia; slightly less than average for Belize; and above average in Limon. Most below-normal precipitation in the Pacific slope of Central America can be associated with a warm ENSO condition for the second half of the year and stronger-than-normal winds associated with the Intra-Americas Seas (IAS) low-level jet. A cold or near-neutral ENSO condition during northern winter 2009 did not reflect in relevant departures from normal conditions in the region.\nFor Cuba, the annual total rainfall for 2009 was below average (Fig. 7.8b). The deficit amounts of rain which affected the three regions of Cuba were 24% below the mean, resulting in the 2nd driest year since 1961. At the end of dry season (November 2008-April 2009 which usually represents 25% of the annual total, only an accumulated value of 18% was observed. The western region ranked as one of the 10 lowest since 1961. Also, the rainy season (May-October 2009) finished with marked deficits in the country, accumulat-ing only 60% of the annual total, and ranked 4th driest for the same period. For Jamaica, the average annual rainfall for 2009 was below normal. This manifested as below-average rainfall for nine months, particularly during the latter half of the year (Fig. 7.9). Barring these, near-normal rainfall amounts were recorded in January while above-normal values were measured during February and May. February, a usually dry month, received 128 mm of rainfall which represented the 13th wettest February on record. The primary cause during that month was the frontal systems and troughs, and the northeastern parishes received much of this rainfall. Also noteworthy were the rainfall amounts recorded for July (57 mm) and October (168 mm), which respectively represented the second and seventh driest monthly totals on record. All 14 parishes experienced below-normal rainfall in July. For October, only two parishes recorded above-normal rainfall. The rainfall deficit experienced during the Caribbean rainfall season (June-November) was related to the appearance and subsequent persistence of El Ni\u00f1o conditions since June 2009. The El Ni\u00f1o contributed to increased vertical wind shear in the main development region over the tropical Atlantic and appeared to have offset the effect of the ongoing multidecadal signal. There were no hurricanes impacting Jamaica. In Puerto Rico, just before the hurricane season began, the presence of several persistent upper-level lows across the southwestern Atlantic, contributed to wetter-than-normal precipitation during April through June (this wet start to the year can been seen in the blue shading in Fig. 7.10). By the end of the year, cooperative weather stations indicated that Puerto Rico experienced another near-normal year, receiving 97% of its normal rainfall; however, precipitation varied from 55% to 113% across the U.S. Virgin Islands in 2009.  November 2008-April 2009. This event affected large areas in the western and central regions. Later, the drought continued across the country and during the rainy season (May-October 2009), which was extremely dry. At the end of 2009, nearly 60% of the country showed moderate to severe dry conditions. This event is consistent with the increasing trend observed in the anticyclone influence on the area in recent decades accompanied by persistent and severe drought. Meteorological drought conditions persisted in Jamaica from January to November 2009 for 3 of the 14 parishes, interrupted only by May rains. The parishes affected were Clarendon, St. Thomas, and St. Mary. In Puerto Rico, on 15 November, record flooding was observed along the Rio Piedras in San Juan-the river crested at an all time high of 7.2 meters-resulting in major flooding across the interior portions of the San Juan metro area. This rainfall event contributed to the 308 mm of rain that accumulated at the Luis Mu\u00f1oz Marin International Airport during November, making it the wettest month since April 2005. However, the year's heaviest 24-hr rainfall came on Christmas Eve, when the remnants of a cold front moved across Puerto Rico dropping 229 mm of precipitation across the municipality of Aibonito, located in the eastern interior of the island. This rainfall event led to significant flash flooding and mudslides, including the destruction of dozens of homes in the municipality of Aibonito, which prompted the governor of Puerto Rico to declare an emergency zone for the affected areas after the event.\nIn Venezuela, dry conditions were predominant during 2009. During the dry season (February-March), the rainfall deficit was near -60 mm. This deficit increased during May-June (start of the rainy season) when it reached between -140 mm to -180 mm, especially over Portuguesa, Gu\u00e1rico, Apure, and Monagas states. The dry conditions affected rice and corn crops in these areas. From August to October, precipitation deficit fluctuated between -140 mm and -220 mm over the center and south zones extending to the Andean region and continuing to December. The main impact of this deficit was evident in the agriculture and energy sectors. Seventy percent of the national energy production comes from El Guri In Colombia, positive precipitation anomalies between +40% and +70% were predominant across the country from January to March, especially in the Andean region. When the Tropical Pacific sea surface temperature switched from neutral to warm conditions, precipitation anomalies became negative. Negative anomalies between -40% and -70% were observed in the last quarter of 2009 over the Caribbean, Andean, and Pacific regions. In Ecuador, negative anomalies were registered from January to May in the coastal and Andean zones. The deficit reached 60% of the normal value. During the second half of the year, the rainfall deficit was generalized over the entire country. Severe restrictions were imposed on the use of hydro energy during November and December. In Peru, the precipitation anomalies were mostly negative during the first quarter of the year, especially in the southern zone where they reached -60% to -100%. In contrast, in April-June, precipitation anomalies became positive, registering up to 100% in the northern and central Amazonia and causing some floods. The possible cause of these rainfalls could be the typical moisture flux coming from the north. This humidity continued in July-August but with minor intensity. The southern region of Peru registered snow and hail storms which paralyzed transportation in this area. In September-October, negative precipitation anomalies down to -80% were registered in northern and central Amazonia, while negative anomalies down to -100% were observed in the southwest of the country. This caused a deficit in the water level of the Titicaca Lake (Puno). In Bolivia, negative precipitation anomalies were also found in January-February in several regions: the Altiplano (-16%), the Valleys (-62%), the eastern Llanos-Santa Cruz (-64%), and the Bolivian Chaco (-71%). This condition persisted from April to October in the Valleys, Beni, and Chaco regions. In northern La Paz, negative anomalies of -49% were observed during the last quarter of 2009. In contrast, Pando in northern Bolivia observed positive precipitation anomalies all year; December was the rainiest month with +58%. Precipitation anomalies from +25% to +50% were also observed during February-March in the eastern Llanos-Santa Cruz while in the Altiplano, anomalies between +58% and +84% were registered in November-December.\nMost of the austral summer and fall months were characterized by episodes of intense rainfall and floods in large cities such as Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, as well as in most of tropical South America, north of 5\u00b0S. This was due to the presence of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ). Northwestern Amazonia observed more than 200 mm above normal. This intense rainfall was the main cause of the record high levels of the Rio Negro River in Manaus in July (see sidebar), the highest level in 107 years of measurements. Northeast Brazil was also severely affected by heavy rainfall and flooding in April and May, otherwise the dry season was predominant in that region.\nIn northwest Africa, annual 2009 precipitation was near normal to above normal. Large positive deviations also occurred in some regions and seasons, especially during the winter 2008/09 and the beginning of winter 2009/10, where rainfall was between 45% and 280% of average for most locations. Precipitation records during December 2009 represented 31% of the annual total. Many weather stations in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia reported rainfall exceeding 150 mm in less than 24 hours. Heavy storms that occurred from 20 to 25 December produced heavy rains causing floods. Rainfall amounts up to 200 mm in 48 hours were recorded, especially in the extreme north of Morocco. For example, Chefchaouen City recorded 834.9 mm in December for which the monthly normal is 265.4 mm (calculated from 1994 to 2000). The fall was variable spatially and temporally, but overall it was wetter than normal; October and November were considerably below average but September total rainfall exceeded the monthly mean by more than +800% in some areas of Morocco (for example in Rabat). In Tunisia, more than 90 mm was recorded in less than four hours at Zarzis, Gribis, and Souihel during the same month. Spring and summer were characterized by reduced rainfall activity over most of northwest Africa reaching more than 90% deficit, especially in August due to anticyclonic conditions. In Egypt, the annual number of rainy days and the annual total precipitation for 2009 were near the historical average (based on 1961-90). The relative humidity was also around the historical average, with a variation range of \u00b15%.\nIn Western Africa, the rainfall anomalies (based on 1971-2000) showed significant deficits in April and May over Guinea, Liberia, southwest C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and south Mali. In contrast, excessive rain-fall was recorded over southeast Ghana, south Togo, southwest Benin, and parts of the central African countries. In June, rainfall deficits were observed over Guinea while heavy rains and floods hit most of the coastal settlements in the subregion. In July, the Sahel rainfall increased with peaks ranging from150 mm-300 mm over western Senegal, the Gambia, and Guinea Bissau. The eastern Gulf of Guinea and northwestern part of the central African countries had a rainfall increase, with peaks ranging from 300 mm-400 mm over Nigeria and Cameroon. In August, the peak rainfall for the Sahel ranged from 300 mm-400 mm over Burkina Faso, southern Mali, and southern Chad, intensifying to about 700 mm over Senegal and the Gambia and resulting in flooding. The southern Gulf of Guinea had a rainfall deficit. Above-normal rainfall was observed over the central African countries with peaks ranging from 300 mm-500 mm, intensifying to about 600 mm over Guinea Bissau, Guinea, and Sierra Leone. In September, the rainfall in the Sahel generally decreased, but high accumulations ranging from 250 mm-500 mm were observed over central Burkina Faso, southern Mali, and Senegal. The Gulf of Guinea countries observed, similarly, a general decrease in rainfall, but observed high amounts of about 400 mm over Guinea Bissau, Guinea, and Nigeria spreading over parts of the central African countries. Compared to the base period 1971-2000, July, August, and September 2009 had significant positive rainfall anomalies with severe rainfall deficits over most of the Gulf of Guinea countries and central African countries (Fig. 7.20). Positive rainfall anomalies were found in September with the maximum amount observed over south Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia, and central and western Mali.\nDecember to February marks the main rainfall season over the southern sector and the hottest season over the equatorial sector. During December 2008-February 2009, most of the northern and equatorial sectors received less than 75% of their long-term average ( Fig. 7.21a). Isolated small areas over southern March to May (MAM) is the main rainfall season over the equatorial sector. The onset of the MAM 2009 seasonal rainfall was rather late and the ending early. The western areas of both southern and equatorial sectors received 75%-125% of their long-term average. The rest of the GHA received less than 75% of their long-term average. The poor rainfall distribution resulted in crop failure and loss of livestock and wildlife due to drought conditions. June to August is the main rainfall season over the northern sector and also the coldest period over the equatorial sector. The western parts of the equatorial sector received substantive rainfall over this period. The northern sector and northern parts of the equatorial sector received less than 75% of their long-term average. Localized areas over northern Uganda, northern and central Ethiopia, and central Sudan received nearnormal precipitation. September to December marks the second rainfall season (short rainfall season) over the equatorial sector. GHA, especially the equatorial sector, has one of the strongest climatic signals of ENSO events in terms of rainfall. The onset of ENSO for the short rainfall season was timely. However, over several locations, the distribution was not uniform with prolonged periods of dryness immediately followed by the onset of the rainfall season. Much of the GHA received between 75% and 125% of their long-term average, with eastern and northwestern Kenya, southern parts of Somalia, and central Tanzania receiving more than 175% of their long-term average (Fig. 7.21b). Episodic rainfall events towards the end of the period resulted in localized flooding in several parts of the central equatorial sector. Fig. 7.22 compares the cumulative 10-day rainfall totals for 2009 with their long-term average. Neghelle, in southern Ethiopia, represents northern sector; Dagoretti, in central Kenya, represents equatorial sector; and Kigoma, in western Tanzania, represents the southern sector. The figure shows the rainfall deficit in the northern and equatorial sectors and adequate rainfall in the southern sector. The rainfall deficits resulted in cumulative climate stress which had both direct and indirect impacts on the climate-dependent sectors. Such impacts that were observed in 2009 include loss of livestock due to inadequate pastures, crop failure resulting in food insecurity, scarcity of the water resources resulting in rationing of hydropower and limited water for domestic and industrial uses, poor health resulting from malnutrition, and contamination of the water sources among other socioeconomic challenges. 4) SoUthern afriCa-A. Kruger, C. mcBride, A. mhanda, J. Banda, and W. m. thiaw This region includes the countries south of 15\u00b0S with more focus on South Africa and Zimbabwe.\nThe mean rainfall of South Africa is temporally and spatially very diverse. The main features are the fairly regular decrease in rainfall from east to west and also the marked influence of orographic features \nFor Comoros, the 2009 annual total anomaly was +41.2% even though rainfall was below normal for nine months. April was very wet, as more than 1700 mm of rain was observed in 23 days. For Madagascar, the annual total was mainly near normal while some small regions in the north and south had belownormal precipitation (Fig. 7.27b). The accumulated annual rain over Mauritius, Agalega, and Rodrigues islands was near normal or slightly above normal. However, October 2009 was the wettest October on record in Mauritius with 250% of the long-term average . For La Reunion, the annual anomaly was +10% over the island (13th wettest year since 1970) although a contrast of -19% in the west to +53% in the southeast was observed. April was also a very wet month in La Reunion. The annual total precipitation was generally near normal for Seychelles.\nAnnual precipitation amounts were normal or above normal in Central Europe (Fig. 7.30), though some regions in southern France received only 70-80% of their normal totals. The United Kingdom and Ireland experienced a wet year. Valentia Observatory in Ireland reported its highest annual rainfall total since records began in 1866. Winter was mainly dry throughout Central and Western Europe (around 60%-80% of normal, Fig.  7.33, DJF), but with heavy snowfall in some areas particularly during February. In February and March, heavy snowfall in parts of the northern Alpine region resulted in peak snow depths of over four meters. It was the driest spring since 1997 in England and Wales, while March was exceptionally wet in eastern Central Europe; the Czech Republic reported almost double its average March rainfall. April was very dry in eastern Central Europe. Hungary recorded only 23% of its average 1971-2000 April rainfall, while Poland experienced rainfall in the 10th percentile of its 1961-90 distribution. England and Wales had their wettest July on record, while western Scotland had its wettest August since records began in 1910. This was the third consecutive wet summer in the UK and Ireland (Fig.  33, JJA). In Switzerland, the city of Lugano reported its highest July precipitation (397 mm) since records began in 1864, mainly due to two large thunderstorms during the middle of the month. In contrast, dry conditions in August and September prevailed over Western and Central Europe. November was the wettest in recorded history across the UK and most of Ireland. The Alps had received intense snowfalls by the end of November. December again was a wet month in most of Western and Central Europe but very dry in Ireland and Scotland.\nTotal annual precipitation was generally near normal over the Nordic countries during 2009 ( Fig. 7.30). While large parts of Sweden and areas in Denmark recorded rainfall above their 1961-90 average, only eastern Iceland received in excess of 125% of their 1951-2000 normal totals. Annual precipitation was below 80% of normal over northern Greenland and parts of northern Scandinavia. Winter in Denmark was characterized by wellbelow-average precipitation, recording only 66% of its average total for the season (Fig. 7.33, DJF). In contrast, in \u00d6stersund, Sweden, a snow depth of 81 cm during February was the highest monthly depth recorded since March 1988. Spring precipitation was more than 20% below normal in parts of Sweden and Denmark, southern Finland and across the Baltic countries. April was particularly dry in southeastern Sweden (in places the driest since 1974), with the region recording less than 5% of its 1961-90 average rainfall. In some locations, no measurable April precipitation was reported; the last month without any measurable precipitation in parts of Sweden was August 2002. It was also dry in the Baltic countries. In contrast, May was the second wettest on record in northern Norway, resulting in a nationwide mean rainfall value that was 165% of its 1961-90 average. Summer was very wet over most of the region (Fig. 7.33, JJA). Rainfall in Denmark and Sweden was 15% above the 1961-90 long-term average. On 11-12 June, Sjaelland in the eastern part of Denmark received more than double its monthly-normal rain within these two days. One station on Sjaelland recorded 160 mm for the event. Likewise, Lithuania was significantly wet in June and July, while for many places in Norway and Sweden July was among the wettest since records began in 1900. Some areas of Sweden recorded up to 350% of their average July totals. Conversely, July and August were very dry in western Greenland; the station of Nuuk recorded its second driest July since 1890 with a total of only 1.4 mm. For Iceland, the first part of the summer (particularly June and July) was very dry in the southern and western part of the island. The summer was the driest for the capital, Reykjavik, since 1889. Similarly, the western part of Iceland suffered from the dry conditions. October was significantly wet in the Baltic countries, with 150% of the 1961-90 average in Latvia and Lithuania. November was wetter than average in southern Scandinavia and Denmark, where the 90th percentile of the 1961-90 distribution was exceeded. A new November record of 27 precipitation days was registered for Denmark as a whole. December precipitation in Latvia was 140% of the 1961-90 normal. In Estonia, snow depths of 43 cm at the end of December set a new record snow depth for this month. In contrast, parts of the Norwegian west coast received < 40% of their December precipitation normal 1961-90 (some areas < 15%) owing to the infrequency of westerly airflow. In Iceland, the number of days in 2009 when the ground was covered by snow was much lower than the 1961-90 normal (e.g., 40 days in Reykjavik compared to a normal of 65 days).\nIberia experienced, on average, near-normal conditions during 2009, with only local sectors of central and southern Iberia receiving less than 80% of the climatological average (Fig. 7.30). Dry episodes are relatively common in Iberia and, regarding the duration and intensity of dry periods in this context, 2009 can be classified as a moderately dry year, particularly when compared with exceptional dry years such as 2005. Nevertheless, all seasons recorded lower-thanaverage precipitation for the aggregated area of Iberia (Fig. 7.33), particularly spring, summer, and autumn, but December 2009 was an exceptionally wet month. May was especially dry (40% of normal), with some stations in northeastern Spain recording new historical minima (as low as 1.1 mm) in a series of up to 130 years. June showed a remarkable dipole pattern over Iberia. While the eastern half of the Peninsula, particularly the Mediterranean coast, was dry, Galicia and much of Portugal were quite wet, with the impact even discernible in the summer (JJA) average (Fig.  7.33, JJA). Rainfall anomalies exceeded 150% along the Atlantic coast. Monthly mean anomalies for June in Lisbon reached nearly 300% (59 mm), although June is a relatively dry month and hence moderate values of precipitation can result in a large percentage anomaly. Averaged across Iberia, autumn seasonal mean deficits were similar to spring and summer; though some regions, like the southern Mediterranean coast, were much wetter than normal. The year closed with considerably wetter-than-average conditions in much of Iberia during December 2009. In southeast Spain, December precipitation was more than twice normal.\nThe year brought well-above-average precipitation over most of the southwestern Balkan Peninsula and southern Italy, exceeding 125% of normal in most places (Fig. 7.30). In Croatia, rainfall was significantly below average in the East, while on the southern Adriatic coast precipitation was above the long-term mean. Some places in Turkey recorded 150% of their annual average. Winter brought wetter-than-normal conditions over most of Italy and the Balkan Peninsula, with the exception of Bulgaria (Fig. 7.33, DJF). January rainfall was particularly high, with maxima in Greece and on the Adriatic coast of the Balkan Peninsula. Luqa Airport on Malta received its highest monthly rainfall total in 85 years (247 mm). The northern Balkan Peninsula experienced drierthan-normal conditions during spring, while wetter conditions occurred in the South. March precipitation in Athens was twice the normal. The eastern Balkan Peninsula had a very dry April, but places in northern Italy registered their second wettest April in 75 years or more, resulting in the flooding of the Po River. It was generally wet during June. Monthly average totals were exceeded by more than 25% with the exception of northern Italy, southern Greece and western Turkey, which were all very dry. July and August were mostly dry. Abundant rainfall occurred in southern Italy and Sardinia in September and October, whereas drier-than-average conditions occurred in Tuscany and northeastern Italy. Autumn was also very wet in the southern and eastern parts of the Balkan Peninsula ( Fig. 7.33, SON). September brought exceptional rainfall totals to Athens (48 mm or 480% of 1961-90 average). Serbia and northern parts of Bulgaria were very wet during October. December was also generally wetter than average across the region. Several stations in northern Italy recorded their wettest or second wettest December in nearly 90 years, mainly due to an intense precipitation event around Christmas. An exceptional local 24-hr precipitation record was set in Makrinitsa in central Greece, where 417.2 mm fell on 10 December. This corresponds to nearly half of the total rainfall for 2009 at this station. Other locations also received exceptional precipitation on that day, resulting in significant flooding and widespread damage.\nPrecipitation totals in 2009 were generally close to or above average for most of Eastern Europe (Fig.  7.30). Only a few places in the Ukraine and central European Russia reported a rainfall deficit, recording 60%-80% of average. Annual precipitation in the north of European Russia exceeded 125% locally. Winter 2008/09 brought near-normal precipitation (Fig. 7.33, DJF) to the region; only a few scattered locations in Eastern Europe received considerably above-average seasonal totals. It was dry, however, in eastern parts of European Russia, with some areas receiving less than 40% of their normal precipitation. Spring was dry in Moldova, with areas receiving only 50%-75% of their average rainfall for the season. Similarly, parts of Romania and Ukraine were also dry. April was particularly dry in the western regions. In Moldova, only 11.5 mm (26% of normal) of rainfall was recorded, making April the second driest in 60 years, second only to April 1974 (9mm). April was also drier than average in the Ukraine and Russia, where many stations reported monthly rainfall amounts below the 10th percentile. Summer was unusually wet in Belarus (second wettest since 1936), mainly due to well-above-average precipitation during June and July. Minsk reported a new record of monthly precipitation in June (187 mm, more than twice normal). However, August had only about half of the normal precipitation totals in Belarus. Autumn precipitation was well above average over northern European Russia and Belarus, as well as in western parts of Romania and Ukraine (Fig. 7.33, SON), with October being particularly wet. Belarus received more than twice its normal rainfall and in Romania precipitation exceeded 150% of normal in most places, with some areas exceeding 200%. In contrast, autumn was dry in Moldova and in central parts of Ukraine. There was a heavy snowfall in Moscow at the end of December, when 19 cm fell within 24 hours. A new record daily snowfall of 31 cm was set in Kyiv, beating the previous record by 3 cm. Ukraine saw heavy snow storms in the first half of December.\nSouthern parts of Israel, Jordan, and parts of Syria received less than 80% of their annual rainfall average ( Fig. 7.30). Anomalies below 40% of normal were restricted to southern and eastern parts of Jordan. For the sixth year in succession, Israel's 2008/09 rainfall season delivered below-average rainfalls, with resulting water shortages and deteriorating quality of ground water reservoirs. In contrast, Georgia and Armenia recorded 100%-125% of normal, while annual precipitation in western Syria, Lebanon, and Cyprus was in the range of normal to slightly below normal, bringing to an end a three-year drought period in Cyprus. In western Kazakhstan, the first half of the year featured a contrasting temporal pattern of rainfall. Winter was particularly dry with areas receiving less than 40% of average precipitation, while spring rainfall was significantly above average, exceeding 160% of normal in places. In the rest of the region, winter and spring precipitation were generally below average (Fig. 7.33, DJF, MAM). Israel had very little rainfall in January, less than 20% of the monthly long-term average, making it one of the driest in the 70-year measurement history; yet, February was the third rainiest in 70 years. Summer was unusually wet in Armenia. Rainfall, sometimes heavy, was reported almost every day during July-September. Autumn was generally very wet across the Middle East (Fig. 7.33, SON), particularly in the Caucasian countries and Syria. In September, the monthly rainfall in Cyprus was eight times higher than normal. Israel also had very heavy rainfall during September and October, marking an early start to the 2009/10 rainy season. In December, Cyprus once again experienced heavy precipitation, with a hailstorm on the 16th resulting in a monthly total of almost 150% of the normal.\nThe average annual precipitation over China was 574.0 mm, 38.8 mm below normal, making 2009 the fourth driest year since 1951 and the driest year since 1987. While spring precipitation was near normal, the seasonal totals for winter, summer, and autumn were all below average. Autumn precipitation was the driest in the last 10 years. As a result of the dry year, China suffered severe drought during 2009. In late 2008 and early 2009, serious autumn and winter rainfall deficiencies affected the northern wheat growing areas. From April to May, severe spring drought impacted Heilongjiang and northeastern Inner Mongolia. From late June to early November, severe summer and autumn drought occurred in Liaoning, Jilin, and southeastern Inner Mongolia. Similarly, from August to early November, severe autumn drought impacted Hunan, Jiangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guangdong, resulting in water levels in parts of the Gan and Xiangjiang rivers being the lowest recorded in the past 50 years. During the summer, the precipitation in eastern China was near to below normal, while precipitation was about 30% below normal in the southern part of Northeast China and the middle part of Inner Mongolia. In Japan, annual precipitation was significantly above normal on the Pacific side of northern Japan. Conversely, rainfall was below normal on the Pacific side of western Japan and Okinawa/Amami, but near normal in other areas. Several tropical cyclones, and the lingering Bai-u front along the Japanese archipelago (consistent with the weak northward expansion of the North Pacific High), brought unusually wet and cloudy conditions to western and northern Japan during July 2009. A new record for monthly total precipitation for July was set on the Pacific side of northern Japan (209% of the 1971-2000 normal), and correspondingly, the Sea of Japan side of the country experienced its lowest monthly sunshine duration since 1946. Some crop damage and a rise in vegetable prices were reported in association with this unsettled weather. The active Bai-u front also caused disastrous flooding in western Japan in July 2009.\nRainfall averaged over Australia for the year was 458 mm (2% below normal), ranking 63rd highest since records began in 1900. Annual rainfall was above normal over most of the northern tropics and in Tasmania but was near or below normal over most of the southern and central mainland.  \nAnnual rainfall for 2009 was below normal (50%-80% of normal) for parts of Auckland, the central North Island, and eastern areas of both islands (northern Hawkes Bay, southern Wairarapa, north Canterbury, inland south Canterbury, and central Otago). Taupo, in the central North Island, recorded its driest year since records began in 1949 (712 mm). Elsewhere, annual rainfall was near normal. The year 2009 was unusually snowy in New Zealand, with an extended snow season that started in April and finished in October. Numerous and heavy snowfall events, and the record warmth of August, contributed to a high-risk avalanche season in the Southern Alps in August and September. Major snowfall events to low levels, which were widespread, were observed on 31 May, 16 June, 2-5 July, and 4-6 October, resulting in significant community impacts. The exceptionally heavy snow event on 4-5 October affected Hawkes Bay and the Central North Island and was estimated to be the worst in October since 1967, stranding hundreds of travelers, closing roads, and resulting in heavy lambing losses. Snowfall was also observed in Taranaki, Waikato, and Rotorua on the 6th, for the first time in about 30 years. The most unusual precipitation event of the year was a coating of red Australian dust, sometimes 2 | mm thick, which fell on parts of Northland, Auckland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty, and Taranaki on 25 September.\nPrecipitation at the major island stations during 2009 was fairly typical of La Ni\u00f1a conditions early in the year and El Ni\u00f1o conditions during the second half of the year (Fig. 7.56; Table 7.5). In the first half of the year, the western half of the basin was wetter than normal, while most of the islands east of 155\u00b0E were drier than average. However, the stronger-thannormal and converging northeast and southeast trade winds typical of La Ni\u00f1a events allowed the trade wind trough to become well developed, keeping the western North Pacific islands between 3\u00b0N-6\u00b0N wet during the first half of the year. The trough axis typically passes very close to Kosrae, which had 2577.1 mm or 108% of normal rainfall during the first half of 2009. Generally throughout Micronesia, rainfall for S189 juLY 2010 STATE OF THE CLIMATE IN 2009 | the first six months, for the last six months, and for the entire year of 2009 fell between 75% and 125% of average. Only the eastern-most part of Micronesia fell outside this bracket, with extremely dry conditions experienced at Kwajalein (40% of average) and very dry conditions at Majuro (67% of average) during the first half of the year. Rainfall in the RMI increased to near-normal levels (95% at Majuro and 92% at Kwajalein) during the second half of the year as the monsoon trough pushed eastward. For the year as a whole, locations west of 155\u00b0E were wetter than normal and areas east of that longitude were drier. The annual rainfall for the major islands in Micronesia ranged from a high of 4890.1 mm (108%) at Kosrae to a low of 1849.9 mm (73%) at Kwajalein in the RMI. Palau at the western edge of the area had 4320.3 mm or 115% of normal, while Majuro at the eastern edge of the area had 2767.1 mm, 83% of normal for the year. In the center of Micronesia, Chuuk had 116% of its normal rainfall during the second half of the year and 106% for the entire year. Table 7.5 shows the annual rainfall amount and percent of normal for the major Micronesian islands."}, {"section_title": "(iii) Notable events", "text": "It was a particularly intense fire season for British Columbia, which saw 3200 fires this year. Of those, 100 were considered significant with nearly half prompting evacuation orders. Wildfires scorched 68 000 hectares of land across the province-almost seven times more than the previous year's fire season. Costs of direct fire fighting were enormous, close to $400 million CAN or six times that budgeted, sur-passing the most expensive season on record in 2003. It was a long and deadly tornado season for Ontario, beginning on 25 April and ending on 28 September, claiming four lives. Ontario witnessed 29 tornadoes in 2009, which tied the record for the most tornadoes in one year, set in 2006. On average, the province sees 11 tornadoes each year. Three lives were lost during the 9 July F2 tornado in northwestern Ontario, an area where tornadoes are relatively rare. The fourth life was lost during the 20 August supercell storm when a boy was killed at a day camp. By the end of the day this storm system had produced at least 18 tornadoes-a record number of tornadoes in one day for Canada-and caused an estimated $100 million CAN in damage from Windsor through North Bay. Manitoba's Red River recorded its second highest spring flooding in nearly 100 years. North of Winnipeg at Breezy Point and St. Clements, ice jamming caused the worst flood of the century, forcing fullscale evacuations. The ice jamming and flooding were caused by a number of factors, including: a wet autumn, heavy snow accumulation during the winter, a cool spring slowing snow melt, and a sharp change in temperature in mid-April that weakened the river ice which broke into large chunks later to jam down river. At the height of the flood, nearly 3000 people left their homes-more than half from First Nations communities. Near Morris, the metres-wide Red River grew to 16 km across, submerging rich farmland and highways. Total flood claims exceeded $40 million CAN with 500 homes damaged or destroyed. Agriculture producers in Alberta and Saskatchewan faced one of the most challenging growing seasons in years with drought, cold, floods, and hail. Parts of the Prairies experienced their driest spring in 50 years and their coldest in 35 years. Cool weather delayed crop development by three to four weeks, and with the risk of frost continuing into July, producers never caught up even when killing cold and the first snows came much later than usual in mid-October. A dozen counties and municipal districts in Alberta declared a state of drought emergency or disaster. Arctic ice continued to be a concern in 2009. In Canadian waters, sea ice extent was similar to that of 2008, but its spatial distribution was different. According to the Canadian Ice Service, greaterthan-normal concentrations of ice occurred in the southeastern Beaufort Sea under prevailing northerly winds that carried some of the multiyear pack ice southwards. In the central and western parts of the Northwest Passage, thicker and more extensive ice led to delays in navigability of the southern route, while the northern route did not become truly navigable at all. By contrast, both routes were navigable in the summers of 2007 and 2008. Close to 80% of the Arctic sea ice was new, weaker, salty, and less than a year old. Further, old, durable multiyear ice was slowly thinning, more broken-up, and moving faster, which all contributed to melting earlier in the season. More information on Arctic sea ice can be found in Chapter 5. Just before midnight on 2 August, a powerful storm moved out of the Rocky foothills and tracked southeastward across the province with wind and hail that left a devastating path of destruction to city and country. The main hail zone hit the extreme northeastern portion of Calgary. Inside the city, hail diameters reached baseball size and wind speeds peaked at 107 km hr -1 . In its wake, the storm left downed trees, broken windows and a swath of damage, knocking out power to several thousand customers. In some places, hail measured 10 cm deep. Canadian insurers estimated industry loss estimates at $500 million CAN, which made it the second or third largest catastrophic event in Canadian history. The massive hailstorm decimated over 600 000 ha of Alberta cropland spurring 1500 hail crop damage claims. In total, two-thirds of the year's hail crop losses occurred as a result of the long weekend storm. 2) United StateS-C. Fenimore, J. Crouch, R. R. Heim Jr., and J. Blunden Based on preliminary data, 2009 was the second consecutive year the nationally averaged temperature was 11.7\u00b0C, which is 0.1\u00b0C above the long-term (1895-2009) average. The year was characterized by extreme fluctuations in the weather pattern. The average temperature for the contiguous United States the first half of the year (January-June) was in the top tercile (25th warmest), while the average temperature during the last half of the year (July-December) was in the bottom tercile (37th coolest). Below-average temperature anomalies in the central United States were associated with above-average precipitation anomalies. Overall, 2009 was the 18th wettest on record for the contiguous United States. Regionally, much-above-normal precipitation fell in the lower and middle Mississippi Valley, parts of the Southeast, and the middle third of the Atlantic Coast. The western third of the United States averaged below-normal precipitation for the year.\nIn Venezuela, one of the reported extreme events was the occurrence of a small tornado in San Cris- \nThe year 2009 was characterized by heavy rainfall events, especially during winter, that affected Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco. These events caused important infrastructure damages and human life loss in many cities and villages when many daily rainfall records for September and December were broken. Record wind speeds also occurred; for example, 140 km hr -1 in Khouribga City in May and 115 km hr -1 in Tangier in December. Several forest fires occurred in July and August, especially when the daily temperature exceeded 50\u00b0C for some locations in Algeria and 49\u00b0C in Morocco. | 2) WeStern afriCa-L.N. Njau and W.m. thiaw Western Africa is the region which extends from the Guinea coast and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire to Chad and the Central African Republic. The year was characterized by above-normal rainfall in the extreme western region, while dry conditions were found in the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Gabon areas. (i) Temperature January 2009 temperature anomalies (based on 1971-2000) were above normal with anomalies greater than 3\u00b0C in eastern Niger, western Chad, and part of northern Nigeria. The positive temperature anomalies continued in February, with anomalies greater than +3\u00b0C covering most of Niger, eastern Mali, northern Burkina Faso, and all of northern Nigeria. From March to June, the positive temperature anomalies decreased and became near normal in July, August and September. In October, the temperature once again became much above normal with anomalies reaching above +3.5\u00b0C over northern Niger. In November and December, the positive temperature anomalies continued over most of Western Africa. At Bilma, located in northern Niger, monthly mean temperatures were above normal for every month of the year (Figure 7.19). Negative temperature anomalies were almost nonexistent in the region, except in January when significant negative anomalies (less than -1.5\u00b0C) were observed over south Mauritania, western Mali, northern Guinea and Senegal.\nAccording to UN Integrated Regional Information Networks (IRIN) 9 October report, more than 60 schools in Senegal were flooded due to the heavy rains in July, August, and September. The spokesperson for Senegal's Interior Ministry confirmed a $4.5 million U.S. emergency plan to pump out the water from flooded zones, rid standing water of mosquito larvae, and provide free health services at medical posts set up in affected areas. 3) eaStern afriCa-C. Oludhe, L. Ogallo, P. Ambenje, Z. Athery, and W. gitau The Great Horn of Africa (GHA) region can be divided into three main sectors. The northern sector (i) Temperature Overall, the temperature was warmer than average over most of the GHA. In June, the minimum temperatures were warmer than normal over western and northern Sudan; localized parts of western, central, and southern Ethiopia; coastal parts of Kenya; and eastern Tanzania. They were cooler than average only over a smaller area including central Somalia and southeastern Ethiopia. During the same month, the maximum temperatures followed a similar pattern; however, the below-average area was larger, extending to south Somalia and eastern Kenya. The patterns of above-average maximum and minimum temperatures in western and central GHA and of below-average maximum and minimum temperatures in the east were generally found throughout the year.\nOn 2 January, 45 families were left homeless when a storm accompanied by strong winds destroyed areas of Taung in the northwest. Villages that were affected include \nApril 2009 was marked by significant heavy rainfall in Comoros, Madagascar, Agalega (part of Republic of Mauritius), and La Reunion. This was due to Tropical Storm Jade, which appeared on 5 April. Wind gusts of 170 km hr -1 were observed on the east coast of Madagascar and heavy precipitation led to Heavy precipitation was also observed in July in Comoros and Seychelles. Although it brought landslides and flooding in Seychelles, the rain was a relief for the country since it was experiencing very dry conditions and government-imposed restrictions on water use. The increase in precipitation was associated with an easterly wave which brought more than 150 mm of rain over a time period of 12 hours. This type of weather is rare in Seychelles. f. Europe 1) overvieW-A. Obreg\u00f3n, P. Bissolli, J. J. Kennedy, and D. e Parker Widespread anomalous warmth affected much of continental Europe in 2009. The annual-average land surface air temperature anomaly from the CRUTEM3 dataset (Brohan et al. 2006), relative to 1961-90, was +1.05 1 \u00b10.07\u00b0C for the European region (35\u00b0N-75\u00b0N, 10\u00b0W-30\u00b0E). This ranked 2009 as between the third and tenth warmest year since 1850, with a nominal ranking of seventh. Notably, 2000-09 was the warmest decade on record for Europe, with an anomaly of +1.0\u00b10.12\u00b0C, significantly warmer than previous decades (1990s: +0.58\u00b10.11, 1980s: +0.06\u00b10.10). The highest temperature anomalies of 2009 were recorded in the Mediterranean countries, Eastern and parts of Central Europe, Fennoscandia (Norway, Sweden, Finland) and the Arctic region (including Iceland and Greenland), all with annual mean temperature anomalies in the range from +1\u00b0C to +2\u00b0C (Fig. 7.29). Svalbard (Arctic Norway), which has recorded the highest anomalies in greater Europe in recent years, again exceeded +2\u00b0C. Total precipitation for the year 2009 ( Fig. 7.30; Schneider et al. 2008) was above average over most of Eastern and Southeastern Europe, Ireland, northern and southern parts of the UK, Iceland, and in parts of Fennoscandia. It was particularly wet in Austria, where new record annual precipitation totals were set in several places, and in Belarus. Drier-than-average conditions occurred over the Low Countries (Neth-erlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg), western parts of Germany, much of France and central parts of England, where totals were 80%-100% of normal. Some smaller parts of Iberia, southern France, Scandinavia, Russia, the Middle East, and Greenland received rainfall totals below 80% of the long-term average over the year 2009. The year commenced with below-average 500-hPa heights over Southern Europe and large positive anomalies over Fennoscandia and Russia (Fig. 7.31,DJF). This large-scale circulation mode is similar to the Eastern Atlantic/Western Russia pattern (Barn-  1987). As a consequence, western and southwestern parts of Europe were significantly colder than normal (Fig. 7.32a), with monthly mean anomalies during January as low as -3\u00b0C in France and parts of Germany. Southern and Southeastern Europe experienced above-average precipitation ( Fig. 7.33, DJF) and increased winter storm activity. In contrast, mild temperatures prevailed over Eastern Europe during winter 2008/09 with peak anomalies > +4\u00b0C in northwest Russia and Finland. Spring was very warm, particularly in Western and Central Europe (Fig. 7.32b), largely due to an anomalous ridge of high pressure which remained dominant throughout the season (Fig. 7.31, MAM). Temperature anomalies peaked during April, when they exceeded +5\u00b0C in places in Germany, Austria, and the Czech Republic (Fig. 7.34). Mean temperature records for April were broken in several locations. Summer was also warmer than normal over Europe, though with smaller anomalies than spring (Fig. 32c). This was largely the result of a dipole pattern of near-to below-average 500-hPa height anomalies over the Atlantic and Fennoscandia, and above-average 500-hPa heights over the Mediterranean and Southern Europe (Fig.  7.31, JJA). Consequently, above-average precipitation was observed across Northwestern Europe and Fennoscandia (Fig. 7.33, JJA), and above-average temperatures were observed across Southern Europe with anomalies exceeding +2\u00b0C in southern France and Spain (Fig. 7.32c). A heat wave affected Italy in July, with temperatures locally reaching 45\u00b0C, while Iberia also experienced several heat waves during the summer. Some stations in Norway reported new daily maximum temperature records. Western and Central Europe were affected by severe thunderstorms, accompanied by heavy rain and hail, causing local flooding. Autumn temperatures were well above average across Europe, particularly in the central and eastern regions (Fig. 7.32d). Precipitation showed extreme temporal and spatial variation during autumn (Fig.  7.33, SON). Positive 500-hPa height anomalies across Northern Europe and a broad trough across Southern Europe during September (Fig. 7.31, SON) were associated with above-average temperatures across much of Europe and western Russia. Southern Europe and the Mediterranean experienced very high precipitation totals (Fig. 7.33, SON). October precipitation was exceptionally high in Eastern and Southeastern Europe, and October temperatures were low in Scandinavia and Northeastern Europe. During November, an extensive flow of marine air into the European continent resulted in generally above-average temperatures with the largest departures in Fennoscandia  The end of the year was characterized by an extremely negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) with high pressures dominating the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, affecting the weather in Europe. The AO Index in December 2009 was -3.4, the lowest value observed for that month in 60 years (Fig. 2.30b in Section 2d), with extremely negative values in the second half of the month. Most of Europe was under the influence of a strong high pressure system over the Arctic and Scandinavia that favored intense advection of cold polar air far into the middle latitudes (Trigo et al. 2004). The negative North American Oscillation index in December also contributed to a starkly contrasting temperature pattern over Europe. While Southeastern Europe and parts of the polar region (Greenland, Iceland, Svalbard) experienced mild temperatures-Greenland was 7\u00b0C warmer than average-colder-than-average conditions prevailed over the northern half of Europe with heavy snowfall in places. The Scandinavian high pressure also caused a dry December in Northern Europe, while most of the rest of Europe, particularly the South, experienced a very wet end of the year. 2) Central and WeStern eUrope-A. Obreg\u00f3n, P. Bissolli, J. J. Kennedy, and D.e. Parker Countries considered in this section include: Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. (i) Temperature Annual mean temperatures in Central Europe were 1\u00b0C-2\u00b0C above the 1961-90 average throughout most of the region (Fig. 7.29). Over Western Europe, anomalies were mostly below +1\u00b0C. Winter 2008/09 was the coldest in the UK since 1996/97. In France, it was the third coldest winter in 20 years. Severe cold waves during January and February brought temperatures below -25\u00b0C to Germany and Poland. The lowest recorded daily minimum temperature in 2009 in Poland was -28.2\u00b0C in the southwest of the country on 7 January. A private weather service station in Saxony, eastern Germany, recorded -29.1\u00b0C on the same day. In contrast, winter was warmer than average in the easternmost regions (Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, and Hungary; Fig. 7.32a). Spring temperatures were well above average, mainly due to an exceptionally warm April (Fig. 7.34). Belgium and Switzerland each reported their second warmest spring on record. April was the second warmest on record for De Bilt in the Netherlands   , and new national records were set for mean anomalies in Hungary (+4.2\u00b0C) and Germany (+4.5\u00b0C;1901. Summer temperatures were generally above average ( Fig. 7.32c), most notably in southern France and Switzerland where anomalies were more than +2\u00b0C. A significant heat wave affected Western Europe during July, while a heat wave in France from 15-20 August resulted in temperatures above 36\u00b0C in the North and 40\u00b0C in the South. Monthly mean temperatures for November were among the three warmest in the last century across the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Belgium, France, and Germany. In southern Germany, maximum temperatures of around 20\u00b0C were reached as a result of foehn winds; such high temperatures are unusual during November. December was cold especially in the UK and Ireland but also in northern Central Europe and on both sides of the Alps, with anomalies below -1\u00b0C. This was mainly due to a long cold spell in the second half of the month.\nA severe North Atlantic storm with strong winds up to 174 km hr -1 affected the UK and Ireland on 17 January. Another Atlantic storm, with gusts of hurricane force, affected Western Europe on 23-24 January. Southern Ireland saw heavy rain with severe flooding on 29-30 January. Unusual snow events affected Western Europe at the beginning of the year. On 6-7 January, a Mediterranean storm dropped 20 cm-40 cm of snow across southeastern France for the first time since 1987. At the beginning of February, the United Kingdom experienced its most widespread snowfalls since 1991, resulting in peak snow depths of up to 30 cm. London received its heaviest snowfalls in 18 years. In the Alpine region, the snows lasted until the end of February even at low elevations, which was unusual, especially south of the Alps. Various episodes of heavy rainfall occurred during summer. On 6 June and 16-17 July, the United Kingdom experienced daily totals of more than 90 mm. Likewise, heavy precipitation, flooding, and mudslides affected Central Europe on 21 June. On 2 July, Dublin was affected by flooding after torrential rainfall. A severe storm on 23 July affected Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic. Autumn also had some noteworthy heavy rain events with flooding. On 3 September in northeast Scotland, daily totals exceeded 120 mm. Parts of Aberdeen city centre were flooded with disruptions to roads and rail services. A frontal system moving across the Atlantic Ocean caused record precipitation and widespread flooding in northwestern England on 18-20 November (see sidebar). Central Europe experienced gusts of hurricane force on 23-24 November. A severe cold spell and heavy snowfall 15-22 December affected most of the region. Temperatures below -20\u00b0C were reported in Germany and France. The Netherlands experienced unusually heavy snowfall, with snow depths up to 30 cm. Cold and snowy conditions continued into 2010. \nThe Nordic Region was hit by a number of significant and relatively rare summer storms that locally caused damage and even casualties. A supercell thunderstorm hit the southern part of central Finland on 28 June. Storm downbursts caused extensive forest damage. Furthermore, extremely large hailstones with diameters up to 8 cm damaged buildings and cars. On 30-31 July, an intense low pressure system formed over southern Norway generating very strong winds in Denmark, southern Sweden, and southern Norway. Wind speeds up to 101 km hr -1 were measured locally along the Danish and Swedish west coast. One ship sank outside the Swedish west coast causing the deaths of six people and a bulk freighter grounded in southern Norway causing an oil spill across a wide area. In the middle of November, Denmark was again hit by a strong storm with wind gusts up to hurricane force (132.5 km hr -1 ). A low-pressure system formed locally over the North Sea developing its full strength when passing Denmark on 18 November. The strong winds considerably raised the sea level along the Danish west coast, uprooted trees, and caused minor damage to buildings.  (Fig. 7.29). The annual mean anomalies for Iberia generally ranged between +1\u00b0C and +2\u00b0C, with higher values in the East. Large parts of the West recorded anomalies of between 0\u00b0C and +1\u00b0C. The year started with a negative anomaly for the winter (-0.72\u00b0C), followed by a warmer-than-average spring (+1.57\u00b0C), a particularly warm summer (+1.88\u00b0C), and a relatively warm fall (+1.26\u00b0C, Fig. 7.31). Several cold spells affected Iberia in January and February. Snowfall occurred even in low-altitude coastal regions of Portugal, which is an unusual phenomenon there, and new records in the number of snow days in Spain were reached for January, e.g., in Le\u00f3n (14 days, highest since 1938, about 800 m elevation) and \u00c1vila (11 days, highest for about 20 years, 1100 m elevation). The following seasons were generally characterized by high values of 500-hPa geopotential height, with maximum anomalies located north of Iberia (spring) and over eastern (summer) and western (autumn) Iberia. It was the third warmest year in Spain since 1961 (anomaly +1.25\u00b0C relative to 1971-2000). The largest anomalies were observed in the central and southern regions, and in the northwestern Iberian Peninsula. The lowest deviations were restricted to the Balearic Islands. Temperature departures in Portugal were highest in the North (+0.9\u00b0C, 1971-2000 base) but generally lower than those anomalies in Spain (+0.5\u00b0C averaged over whole mainland Portugal). The warmest months of 2009 in Spain (relative to normal) were May, June, October, and November, when mean temperatures were more than 2\u00b0C above average. Overall, in Portugal the warmest months (relative to normal) were March, May, and October. Winter 2008/09 temperatures were slightly below the long-term average. In contrast, much of the rest of the year was exceptionally warm (Fig. 7.32). Temperature anomalies in spring exceeded +2\u00b0C in the central Peninsula, while summer brought record mean temperatures (for the last 50 years) to many stations in Catalonia and to northern and central parts of the Peninsula. The summer and autumn anomalies for Spain including the Balearic Islands were +1.9\u00b0C and +1.7\u00b0C, respectively, making both seasons the third warmest on record. In November, some stations in southern and eastern Spain reported record-breaking monthly mean temperatures at stations with long histories (e.g., Valencia, with observations dating back 141 years.)\nOn 24 January, an exceptional storm hit northern Spain with strongest gusts reaching 190 km hr -1 . It was the worst storm in this region since 1999 (see sidebar). On 27-29 September, heavy precipitation was recorded at a number of locations on the Spanish southeastern coast. Although such convective episodes are typical for that time of the year, the event of 27-29 September significantly contributed to the very high monthly totals, which broke records at some locations in southeastern Iberia (e.g., Alicante with 309 mm; records commenced in 1939) and the Balearic Islands (e.g., Palma, with 222 mm; series commenced in 1951).  (Fig. 7.29), exceeding anomalies of +2\u00b0C over eastern Slovenia and +2.5\u00b0C in northeastern Italy and western Slovenia. Throughout Croatia, very high annual temperatures prevailed, exceeding the 98th percentile of the 1961-90 distribution over most regions. In Zagreb, it tied with 2008 as the third warmest year since 1862. In Turkey, the 2009 mean temperature was 0.9\u00b0C above the 1971-2000 average. Winter temperatures were near normal over most of the region (Fig. 7.32a). Negative anomalies were observed over the western Mediterranean, Sicily, Sardinia, and in parts of Italy. The largest positive anomalies were recorded in Bulgaria and Montene-gro, where many locations in the East recorded their warmest winter on record. Spring and summer were exceptionally warm except in Turkey, which was colder than normal ( Fig.  7.32b,c). April was particularly warm in Serbia and Croatia (Fig. 7.34). May was the third warmest in the last two centuries in Italy, mainly due to a heat wave at the end of the month. Another very strong heat wave in July brought temperatures of 40\u00b0C-45\u00b0C to various places in Italy. The official peak value was 45.0\u00b0C in Decimomannu, Sardinia, a new local record. In Mostar (Bosnia and Herzegovina), it was the warmest summer on record. September was particularly warm in Turkey, with maximum and minimum temperature records broken in a number of locations. In Italy, December was a month of strong contrasts. A cold spell between 18-23 December saw a number of records broken in northern Italy, with temperatures falling below -15\u00b0C in a number of locations. Only days later, on 25-30 December record high temperatures were recorded across central and southern Italy, with temperatures exceeding 25\u00b0C. In Bulgaria, several stations registered record high temperatures on Christmas Day (e.g., 21.2\u00b0C in Vratsa). December mean temperature was well above normal The storm (labeled Klaus by the German Weather Services, DWD) developed off Bermuda on 20 January and crossed the Atlantic, reaching the Bay of Biscay in the early hours of the 23rd, where it deepened further (Liberato et al. manuscript submitted to Weather). The strongest winds induced by Klaus were felt in northern Spain, including the large populated cities of Santander, Bilbao, and Barcelona (Fig. 7.36). But it was in southern France (namely in the cities of Bordeaux, Narbonne, and Perpignan) that the wind gusts surpassed many previous records. The highest level of wind warning possible was issued by Meteo France, though sadly at least 20 fatalities occurred that were a direct consequence of the storm. More than one million homes suffered power cuts as trees and power lines were downed, while road and rail links were blocked and airports closed. Klaus was considered the most damaging wind storm to affect northern Iberia, southern France, and the western Mediterranean since the storm Martin in late December 1999, which killed 88 people and uprooted millions of trees (Liberato et al. manuscript submitted to Weather). \nAn outbreak of cold air from Eastern Europe brought abundant snowfall over northern Italy from 3-10 January. Temperatures dropped below 0\u00b0C in many places. On 7 January, a snow depth of 26 cm was reported in Milan. On 24 February, exceptionally heavy rainfall in Malta led to the cancellation of the National Carnival grand finale. A heavy storm over the western Mediterranean with gusts up to hurricane force, heavy rain, snowfall, and high seas followed on 4-6 March due to a cut-off cyclone. From 20-22 June, an Atlantic disturbance affected most of Italy with heavy rainfall and strong winds. Daily precipitation on 21 June set new records at four locations which had 58 years of record. On 7-12 September, torrential rains and flooding affected northwestern Turkey, with the heaviest rainfall in 80 years. Istanbul received 67 mm of rain within one hour on 9 September. A violent storm crossed southern Italy on 15-17 September, flooding the city of Palermo (Sicily). On 2 October, a storm dropped 70 mm of rain within six hours in Messina, Sicily. Civil protection measurement stations recorded up to 300 mm of precipitation at mountainous sites, resulting in Italy's worst mudslides in more than a decade. Abundant snowfalls occurred from 18-20 December over northern parts of Italy, with depths up to 30 cm. Subsequent warming and continuous rainfall resulted in rapid snowmelt causing extensive flooding in Tuscany just before Christmas. 6) eaStern eUrope-A. Obreg\u00f3n, P. Bissolli, J. J. Kennedy, and D. e. Parker Countries considered in this chapter include: European Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, and Romania.\nSevere rainfall was recorded in northern Israel on 27-28 February. Precipitation amounts of 100 mm-180 mm over 48 hours caused flooding and extensive damage to agriculture. This event also affected Cyprus, with flooding in a number of places. Severe drought conditions, which began in 2006, affected eastern Syria during August. Thousands of Syrian farming families were forced to migrate to cities after two years of drought and failed crops. However, high September rainfall brought an end to this drought period. Accompanied by heavy precipitation and hailstorms, a tornado affected several areas in Cyprus on 18 September causing injuries and significant damage. Tornadoes of lower intensity along with large hail on 19 September affected areas around Nicosia. \nIn early January, ice slush buildup occurred at Sochi (Black Sea coast), with a maximum depth of 96 mm, while 38 avalanches, with volumes as large \nOver the western North Pacific and the South China Sea, 22 named tropical cyclones (TCs) formed in 2009, 13 of which reached typhoon intensity. This total is less than the 30-year (1971-2000) average frequency of 26.7. Although the formation of the first named TC in 2009 was relatively late, the total number of cyclones (21) that formed from May to October was similar to the 30-year average frequency of 21.3. Morakot swept across the Taiwan Province and caused more than 400 deaths and severe damage to agriculture and infrastructure. In spring 2009, China was affected by seven dust and sand events (five dust storms, two blowing sand), which was significantly less than 2000-08 average of 13.3 events. The average number of dust days across all recording stations in northern China was 0.9 days (4.7 days less than normal of 1971-2000), ranking the least since 1954. The Republic of Korea was affected by a total of 10 dust events during 2009, with the strongest occurring on 25 December and lasting for two days. The average number of dust days over the 28 recording stations was 7.7 days in 2009, which was twice the normal (3.8 days) but slightly less than the most recent 10 years, which averaged 9.2 days. The number of dust days in spring 2009 was 2.5 days, which was slightly below normal (3.6 days) and one-third of the recent 10-year average (7.5 days). The year was notable in that 60% of all dust events appeared during the autumn and winter seasons. In Japan, the number of days on which any meteorological station in Japan observed a Kosa (yellow sand/aeolian dust event) in 2009 was 22, which was near normal (20.2 days). The annual cumulative number of Kosa observations in 2009 was 251, which was above normal (163.0 days). Kosa was observed in October and December for the first time in last 17 years and 16 years, respectively. Asian summer monsoon activity was generally suppressed throughout the season, except in the western North Pacific monsoon region. At the north periphery of the upper Tibetan High, the subtropical jet stream was stronger than normal. The South China Sea (SCS) summer monsoon (SCSM) broke out in the 6th pentad of May and with-juLY 2010 STATE OF THE CLIMATE IN 2009 | excess rainfall, while 11 subdivisions received normal rainfall and the remaining 22 subdivisions received def icient rainfall. Out of 516 meteorological districts for which rainfall data were available, 59% of districts received 80% or less of their LTA. The 2009 summer monsoon was also characterized by strong intraseasonal variability (Fig. 7.45). Consistent with the observed decreasing trend in the frequency of monsoon depressions over the Indian Ocean, only four short-lived depressions formed during the season, against the long-term average of seven. Over India, rainfall activity during the winter and pre-monsoon seasons was also below average. In 2009, the annual rainfall over the country was the most deficient (20% below normal) since records began in 1875, surpassing the previous record set in 1972. During the winter, rainfall over the country was 46% below normal, while during the pre-monsoon season (March-May), rainfall deficiency was 32%. While no drought had occurred over South Asia in the previous decade (1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000), the recent decade (2001-09) witnessed three major droughts in 2002, 2004, and 2009. During the 2009 summer monsoon season, Pakistan also experienced one of its worst droughts. The area-weighted summer monsoon rainfall over Pakistan was 26% below its LTA. Most parts of the country, with the exception of Karachi and Hyderabad (southwest Sindh), experienced large rainfall deficiencies during the season. As a result, the 2009 monsoon season rainfall was the third lowest in the most recent decade (2001-09), after 2002 (54% deficiency) and 2004 (38%). Rainfall in July, August, and September was 9%, 41%, and 37% below normal, respectively. The observed drought over the region had several possible causes. These include the El Ni\u00f1o-Modoki (w a r m i n g ove r t he Centra l Pacific; Ratnam et. al 2010), unusually warm equatorial Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures (Francis and Gadgil 2010), and the formation of an anomalous blocking high over west Asia with the associated descent of dry air into the Indian region (Krishnamurti et al. 2010). T he northeast monsoon (NEM) sets in over southern peninsular India during October and over Sri Lanka in late November. The NEM contributes 30% to 50% of the annual rainfall over southern peninsular India and Sri Lanka as a whole. The 2009 NEM seasonal rainfall over south peninsular India was above normal (110% of LTA), consistent with the observed relationship with El Ni\u00f1o. During the first week of November, heavy rainfall caused significant flooding and landslides in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, sadly leading to the deaths of about 75 people. Above-normal rainfall was also reported over Sri Lanka during the season.\nHeat wave/hot day conditions prevailed over parts of central and peninsular India during the first three weeks of March; over the northern parts of the country on many days during April; and over northern, central, and peninsular parts of the country during the second half of May. There were approximately 150  Tropical Cyclone Aila developed as a tropical depression on 23 May in the North Indian Ocean and made landfall near the India-Bangladesh border on 25 May as a severe cyclonic storm. The storm not only affected residents but also affected the ecosystem of the Sundarbans. Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh, received 290 mm of rain on 29 July, the greatest rainfall in a single July day since 1949. On 16 July, northern parts of the west coast of India received exceptionally heavy rainfall, with many stations reporting record heavy rainfall, causing largescale flooding. On 16 July, Veraval, a coastal town in Gujarat, recorded 500 mm of rainfall in just 24 hours. During the first week of October, the southern states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh received their heaviest rainfall in more than 60 years, leading to one of their worst floods on record. At least 286 people were killed and 2.5 million were left homeless following the torrential downpours and subsequent flooding. Government officials reported total damages in the range of $6.7 billion U.S. On 3 October, the city of Panjim on the west coast of Goa, recorded 256.8 mm of rainfall in 24 hours, the heaviest October rainfall on record for Panjim (   Iraq-m. Rogers Iraq, in 2009, experienced temperatures higher than the 1961-90 average across most areas and the extension of the drought which has led to falling river levels in the Tigris and Euphrates. Rainfall was generally lower than the 1949-90 average, which had a massive impact upon wheat, rice, and barley production within the country.\nAt the start of 2009, soil moisture levels were below normal for much of the North Island (except Gisborne and northern Manawatu), as well as in the Tasman District, northern Westland, north and south Canterbury, and south Otago. However, rainfall in late February returned soil moisture levels to near-normal status across much of the country. For regions in the north and east of the North Island, and eastern South Island (Northland, Auckland, Coromandel, Bay of Plenty, central North Island, Gisborne, Hawkes Bay, Otago, Canterbury, the Kaikoura coast), severe soil moisture deficits had again developed by the end of the year, following an extremely windy and dry November and December period. Northland was particularly affected. The geographical pattern of significant soil moisture deficits in northern and eastern areas seen at the end of 2009 is a typical impact of El Ni\u00f1o conditions for New Zealand. There were 15 flooding events in New Zealand in 2009, slightly less than 2008. Major flooding occurred on 27 April on the West Coast. On that day, Mt. Cook recorded 341 mm of rainfall (its highest April one-day total since records began in 1928), and torrential rain fell in Greymouth, where roads became impassable and homes were evacuated. Trampers were stranded in the Mueller Hut in Aoraki Mt. Cook National Park, and about 120 people were evacuated from the Milford Track by helicopter. Heavy rains also caused flooding on 16-20 May in the Canterbury and Otago regions, when the Rangitata River burst its banks. On 29 June, heavy rain resulted in landslips and road closures in the Manawatu-Wanganui region. Heavy rainfall in the Gisborne District on 29 and 30 June led to flooding, evacuations, landslips, and the declaration of a Civil Defence Emergency. 3) SoUthWeSt paCifiC-A.

From May until the end of the year, the trade winds weakened and hence westerly wind anomalies covered large portions of the equatorial Pacific, with the exception of some areas near the date line. Fourteen synoptic-scale low-pressure systems formed in the Southwest Pacific in 2009. In January, record-breaking rainfall was recorded in Viti Levu  \nThe high sea levels that prevailed in 2007, 2008, and early 2009 finally began to fall by midyear as El Ni\u00f1o conditions reduced the easterly wind stress that caused water to mound up in the west of the basin. In the first three months of the year, coastal flooding and inundation affected many of the low islands from the Marshall Islands in the East to Palau in the West. From January through March 2009, sea levels averaged 15 cm-25 cm above their normal monthly averages, but during full and new moon phases, the high-tide levels were sometimes as high as 80 cm-110 cm above their normal monthly averages. The high astronomical tides coupled with the effect of La Ni\u00f1a and the long-term rising trend in sea level caused considerable coastal inundation in Chuuk State and in the Marshall Islands, contaminating drinking water and destroying crops. Weakened trade winds, starting | in April, triggered Kelvin waves which depressed the thermocline east of the dateline, resulting in higher ocean heat content and thus elevated sea level toward the Central and South American coasts. Correspondingly, this reduced ocean volume in the equatorial western Pacific, causing sea levels there to fall. Tropical cyclone activity in 2009 across Micronesia increased considerably from 2008 (see chapter 4), as the El Ni\u00f1o conditions caused tropical cyclone genesis to occur farther to the east into central Micronesia. Super typhoons Choi-wan and Melor were the most notable, with Choi-wan devastating Alamagan Island (17.60\u00baN,145.85\u00baE) in the Northern Mariana Islands and forcing the post-storm evacuation of the 14 residents. are based on station data over land and sea surface temperature data over water.

Precipitation across the United States in 2009 was characterized by persistent wetness in the Midwest and Southeast, while precipitation in the West, Northwest, and Southwest was below average (Fig. 7.4b). Arkansas observed its wettest year on record with four months of top three precipitation ranks (May, wettest; July, third wettest; September, second wettest; October, wettest). The unrelenting weather pattern also contributed to the second wettest annual period in Alabama and Illinois. More than half of the contiguous United States received above-normal precipitation for the year. Conversely, the lack of monsoonal moisture in the Southwest contributed to Arizona's fifth driest annual period. The decadal trend of the contiguous United States continued its above-normal precipitation streak with the past decade (2000-09) averaging 18 mm above the 20th century average and precipitation over the past four decades averaging 27 mm above the 20th century average. It was the 22nd driest winter (December 2008-February 2009) for the contiguous United States in the 1895-2009 record. Texas recorded its driest winter period, while North Dakota experienced its wettest winter on record. The contrasts in rankings were the result of an active upper-level pattern that shuttled systems rapidly across the northern-tier states, while bypassing the deeper south. Conversely, the contiguous United States experienced its 18th wettest spring (March-May). Relatively slow-moving storm systems and surface fronts across the southern United States led to above-normal precipitation averages across the southeastern United States. Georgia experienced its second wettest such period. Several other states experienced a spring period that saw above-average precipitation: Florida and Illinois (fifth wettest each), Alabama (seventh), and Arkansas (ninth). In March, record flooding occurred in parts of Minnesota and North Dakota along the Red River. The flooding was preconditioned by copious winter precipitation coupled with persistent precipitation-producing storms in the spring. Record-high flows were recorded along the Red River with peak levels exceeding the 500-year return interval. Summer (June-August) precipitation was variable in 2009, which is typical for the season, but overall near normal, ranking 54th wettest out of 115 years. Regionally, the Northeast had its second-wettest summer on record, continuing a string of abnormally wet summer periods. Deficient monsoonal rains in the Southwest contributed to Arizona's third-driest summer. Precipitation averages in Georgia and South Carolina were also much below normal. Conversely, Massachusetts experienced its wettest summer and it was Maine's third-wettest such period. It was the 11th wettest autumn (September-November) on record for the contiguous United States. Anomalously wet conditions in October led to a record wet month for the nation as a whole. The nationwide precipitation of 105.4 mm was nearly double the long-term average of 53.6 mm. Persistent precipitation during September and October made Arkansas' autumn precipitation its greatest ever. Nine other states were much above normal in terms of precipitation for the autumn season. Interestingly, these high precipitation anomalies occurred despite only two tropical cyclones (Tropical Storms Claudette in August and Ida in November) making landfall during the Atlantic Hurricane season. The variable climatic extremes continued in November when the upper-level jet retreated to the north, contributing to a nationally-averaged precipitation that ranked 18th driest, continuing the run of below-normal November precipitation in the contiguous United States. The summer and fall months were drier than average in much of Alaska. During winter 2008/09, snowpack levels were below-to near-normal for the Cascade Mountains and the Northern Rockies in Idaho, Montana, western Wyoming, and Utah. The Olympic Mountains and Okanagan Highlands of Washington had snow levels less than 50% of normal. The Sierra Nevadas also experienced below-normal snowpack for the season. Conversely, the central and southern Rockies in Colorado, New Mexico, and northern Arizona had above-normal snowpack totals by the end of the season. Alaska snowpack was generally above normal, with the exception of the northern and southern coastal regions of the state. March brought several large snowstorms that broke daily and monthly snow records across the center of the country. Statewide records for 24-hr snowfall accumulations were observed in Texas (64 cm), Oklahoma (66 cm), and Kansas (76 cm). Seasonal snowfall records were measured in International Falls, Minnesota, with 318 cm and Spokane, Washington, with 248 cm of snowfall. The beginning of the 2009/10 snow season brought below-normal snowpack to the western United States, including much of Alaska, while Arizona and New Mexico observed above-normal snowpack. The low snowfall amounts contributed to ongoing drought in California. October and December were particularly snowy across the contiguous United States, with both months setting new snowfall extent records. October was North Platte, Nebraska's snowiest month on record with 77 cm, while December brought record snowfall to the Northeast corridor and the Plains, including Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Washington, D.C.; and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma."}, {"section_title": "(iii) Droughts and wildfires", "text": "Widespread precipitation extremes occurred during 2009, with large areas (20-25%) of the country very dry (monthly precipitation total in the bottom tenth percentile of the historical record) during January, February, and November and large areas very wet (top tenth percentile) during May, June, October, and December. The dryness exacerbated areas of drought during early 2009 while the abundant precipitation brought drought recovery during the later months. The year began with 19.2% of the contiguous United States experiencing moderate to exceptional drought, as defined by the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM). That percentage increased to 26.6% by late March before decreasing during the summer and fall, ending the year at 12.4%, which was among the lowest values in the ten-year USDM record. Based on the 110-year Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) record, 2009 capped a decade of expansive drought, with the 2000-09 decade ranking as the third biggest drought decade in the last 110 years. The drought epicenters during 2009 were southern Texas, the southern Appalachians, California, and Hawaii. Severe agricultural impacts were felt, especially in Texas and Hawaii. Low streams, reservoirs and stock ponds, and depleted soil moisture combined S140 juLY 2010 | to ravage agricultural (pasture, range, and crop) lands in Texas early in the growing season. Heavy irrigation of crops was required across much of Hawaii amidst low soil moisture and irrigation restrictions in some areas. Beneficial rains beginning in September brought drought relief to southern Texas, but not before these areas turned in their driest September-August 12-month period in the 1895-2009 record. The PDSI plummeted to the extreme drought category by early summer, but it did not pass the levels of the record 1950s drought for southern Texas, both in terms of intensity or duration. An analysis of post oak treering chronologies from 1652-1995 indicates that southern Texas has experienced a dozen individual years prior to the 20th century which had very low January-June precipitation similar to the lowest values of the past 110 years. The 1950s drought likely was matched and possibly exceeded by one that occurred during 1711-17. Parts of the Southeast began 2009 with lingering moderate to extreme drought, but by the beginning of summer, drought in the Southeast was mostly gone. Parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley and adjacent western Great Lakes have been in some level of dryness or drought for most of the last seven years, with moderate to severe drought lingering at year's end. Northwest Wisconsin had the driest 12-month October-September period on record in 2009 (October 2008. Parts of the West, especially California, have suffered through three years of drought. Northern STRONG SEASONALITy IN 2009 U.S. TEMpERATURES-NOAA CSI teAm-m.P. HOeRLINg What Happened? Headlines regarding U.S. surface temperatures for 2009 should read \"Strong Monthly and Seasonal Variability\". This climate variability story is all too easily obscured by the mundane outcome that annually-averaged temperatures were just slightly above their 20th century average (+0.2\u00b0C). As illustrated in Fig.  7.5 (left panels), the year began (JFM) with much-above-normal temperatures (i.e., in the top quintile of the 115-yr record) over the Central and Southern Great Plains and the Desert Southwest, flanked to the north and east by below-normal temperatures. A southward expansion of cold conditions occurred across much of the Great Plains in the spring (AMJ). By the summer (JAS), much-below-normal temperatures shifted eastward, and a swath from the eastern Plains thru the upper Ohio Valley succumbed to record-breaking low July averaged temperatures. Meanwhile, the western third of the United States remained very warm during the summer, and September was the warmest month on record for California and Nevada. But that latter warmth too came to an abrupt end, with the West and Rockies experiencing much below temperatures during the fall (OND) that also engulfed the western Plains (notwithstanding a brief interlude of high temperatures during November). By all measures, a wild rollercoaster ride for U.S. temperatures through 2009!"}, {"section_title": "Why did it happen?", "text": "Can any reason be given for this strong seasonality? Such seasonal extremes most certainly were not the result of human-induced climate change. It is known that the U.S. tem-perature impact of greenhouse gas (GHG) and aerosol forcing, as estimated from the climate models of the IPCC Fourth Assessment, is comparatively uniform across the seasons. Thus, the observed rapid swings between much-below-and much-above-normal temperatures in 2009 were unlikely a symptom of anthropogenic forcing. Natural processes of climate variability were instead more likely the dominant cause. In the far-away reaches of the equatorial Pacific, a no-less dramatic seasonal reversal in SST conditions was taking place during 2009. La Ni\u00f1a conditions that developed in late 2008 persisted through March 2009. A swift transition occurred in early spring, leading to El Ni\u00f1o SST conditions by July. This El Ni\u00f1o increased to moderate intensity by October 2009. The impact of tropical east Pacific SST forcing on U.S. seasonal climate is well known, and the question we ask here is which, if any features of U.S. temperature seasonality may have resulted from the seasonal reversal in SST forcing. Six different global climate models were subjected to the monthly variability in observed 2009 global SSTs. The resulting ensemble-averaged seasonally varying U.S. temperature response (260 simulations in total) is shown in the right side plots of Fig. 7.5. Several qualitative aspects of the observed seasonality appear linked to fluctuations in the oceans. Notably, a warm JFM over much of the Great Plains gave way to cold conditions during JAS in the simulations. Likewise, the early winter warm conditions in the southern Plains and Gulf Coast were replaced by cold conditions in fall in the simulations. These simulated features are broadly consistent with the seasonality observed, and they juLY 2010 STATE OF THE CLIMATE IN 2009 | California began the year with moderate to extreme drought. Conditions improved throughout the year, but the state ended 2009 with areas of moderate to severe drought remaining. An analysis of blue oak tree-ring chronologies from the coast ranges of California revealed as many as seven three-year drought events in the 1332-1900 period which were more severe than the driest three-year drought events of the 20th to early 21st centuries. The United States had a near-normal wildfire season for 2009, similar to 2008. The first half of the year was marked by above-average number of fires and acreage burned, primarily in the western and central regions of the country where ongoing drought had increased fire danger. The second half of the year was generally cool and wet for the nation and was associated with below-average fire activity. For the year as a whole, nearly 77 500 fires burned over 2 million hectares. Despite the near-normal season, the Station Fire in California burned an estimated 64 983 hectares, marking the largest recorded fire in Los Angeles County history and California's tenth largest fire since 1933. (iv) Tornadoes Across the United States, 2009 was a below-average year for tornadoes. As of February 2010, confirmed tornado reports and estimates for the end of 2009 indicated that there were 1150 tornadoes from January-December, which is below the 10-year (1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008) average of 1291 and the fifth lowest (sixth highest) total of the decade. The number of strong-to-violent By no means are all the seasonal features of 2009 U.S. temperatures interpretable as resulting from ocean forcing. In particular, the spatial scale and intensity of the observed cold summer conditions is considerably greater than the simulated SST-induced coolness. Likewise, the very cold conditions over the western United States during fall were apparently unrelated to that region's sensitivity to the SST forcings. These conditions are assumed to have resulted from purely atmospheric-driven variability. An important research task remains to ascertain how likely the cold summer and fall conditions were given both the state of global SSTs and anthropogenic GHG forcing in 2009. juLY 2010 | tornadoes (rated EF3-EF5) reported in 2009 was 21, which is also below average. There were 21 tornado fatalities in 2009, associated with nine tornadoes, which is the second lowest in the 1950-2009 record. The most deadly tornado of the year occurred in Oklahoma on 10 February, when an EF4 killed eight people. This was the state's first February EF4, and the deadliest February tornado in Oklahoma history. February was also the most deadly month of the year with a total of nine fatalities. Louisiana and Alabama had their busiest tornado year of the decade, while the typically active states of Texas and Kansas had their second slowest. The largest outbreak of the year occurred on 9-10 April when 117 tornadoes were reported from Texas to North Carolina.

A. mAReNgO", "text": "During the austral summer and winter 2009, the Amazon basin, drained by the Amazon River and its tributaries, was hit by heavy flooding. This year the water level rose higher and stayed longer than it has in several decades. According to national and international press, almost 376 000 people were left homeless and 40 died because of the floods. The communities living on the river banks and on the urban areas of cities like Manaus suffered the impacts of the rising waters, and the floods affected the exotic wildlife and the endangered species. Damages were estimated on the order of $200 million U.S. in the Brazilian state of Amazonas. During the summer (December 2008-February 2009), above normal rainfall was found in the entire Amazon region (Fig. 7.12a), reaching 100% above normal in northern and western Amazonia, where the basin of the Rio Negro is located. Brazil's Center for Weather Forecasts and Climate Studies reported large rainfall anomalies during January and February 2009. During late summer and fall (Fig. 7.12b), rainfall in northern and central Amazonia was between 25% and 50% above normal, and the largest rainfall anomalies (up to +100%) were detected in the border region of eastern Amazonia and northeast Brazil. In central Amazonia, rainfall in April, May, and June was between normal and above normal. In the city of Manaus, during the first 15 days of June 2009 it rained almost 30 mm above the climatology for that month (117 mm). According to the measurements of the State University of Manaus (UEA), the heavy rainfall of January-February in northwest Amazonia led to high water levels of the Solim\u00f5es River at Tabatinga in March-April. The water levels reached 12.5 m, compared to the long-term climatology of 11.8 m. The water levels of the Rio Negro at Manaus and the Amazonas at Obidos reached high values a few months after. The level of Rio Negro at Manaus reached maximum values between May and July. The measurements at Manaus site reflected the contribution of the Rio Negro and, to some degree, the Rio Solim\u00f5es that extend over Amazonia. It takes about four to five months for rain falling on the upper basin of the Rio Negro in northwest Amazonia to travel downstream to the Manaus gauge site. Therefore, the anomalously high levels measured during June and July were due to the intense rainfall that fell during January and February over northwestern Amazonia and, to a lesser degree, to the intense rainfall in May and June over central Amazonia, where the rainfall takes one month or less to reach the gauge site at Manaus. Historically, according to the Brazilian Geological Survey, the floods in Amazonia in 2009 show the highest levels in the history. In July, the level of the Rio Negro in Manaus reached 29.75 m, a new record high since the beginning of data collection in 1903. The five previous records observed in Manaus were: 29.69 m (1953;Fig. 7.13), 29.61m (1976Fig. 7.13), 29.61m ( ), 29.42 m (1989Fig. 7.13), 29.61m ( ), 29.35 m (1922Fig. 7.13), 29.61m ( ), and 29.17 m (1908. Levels of the Amazon River at \u00d3bidos and the Tapajos River at Santarem also showed records highs. Furthermore, the levels of the Amazonas, Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, Napo, and Corrientes Rivers in the Peruvian Amazon also experienced record level/discharge highs, according to the meteorological service of Peru (SENAMHI). During the austral fall, northeastern Brazil, Amazon region, and northern Bolivia observed normal rainfall. The largest anomalies were observed on the border between eastern Amazonia and northeast Brazil, with rainfall anomalies greater than 100 mm per month until June, which normally marks the beginning of the dry season. The ITCZ was intense. In some places in the Amazon, rainfall was 300 mm above normal. In the Peruvian Amazonia, the river levels were about 1 m-2 m above normal. In northeast Brazil, 49 deaths occurred as a consequence of floods. More than 408 000 were left homeless and damages to highways and irrigation structures were reported. In May, eight people died because of the breaking of a small dam in the state of Piau\u00ed in Northeast Brazil, and 600 families were forced to leave their houses. The estimated losses due to the floods in Brazil until July were about $800 million U.S. On the other hand, during April, a severe drought was reported in Paraguay, with negative precipitation anomalies around -160 mm in the south of the country. This represents a new historical record minimum precipitation for that month. During the spring (September-November), when the rainy season normally starts, anomalously wet conditions were reported in most of southeastern South America, causing floods in Paraguay, where thousands of people were forced to evacuate along the Paran\u00e1 River. The anomalously wet conditions detected over most of this region affected the harvest of rice and other vegetables. In November, while extremely large rainfall anomalies were detected over Uruguay, southern Brazil, southern Paraguay, and northern Argentina, dry conditions were reported on the coast of Ecuador and the South American monsoon region. In the same region, the last two weeks of November were characterized by dry weather and relative humidity of about 15%. In December, very wet conditions (rainfalls of 100 mm-150 mm above normal) were reported in southeastern Brazil and northern Paraguay. Intense rainfall and landslides in the city of Angra dos Reis, Rio de Janeiro, killed 53 people on New Year's Eve, and intense rainfall episodes were detected in most of southeastern South America in December. From 31 December 2009 to 1 January 2010, the total rainfall was 275 mm in Angra dos Reis. The cities of Cochabamba, Chuquisaca, Tarija, and Santa Cruz in Bolivia were affected by floods, forcing more than 10 000 families into food insecurity.

Rainfall from January to April was above average over the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Fiji, Tonga, Niue, and the Southern Cook Islands, while rainfall deficits were significant along the equator and over French Polynesia. The rainfall pattern observed over the Southwest Pacific was heavily influenced by the state of ENSO. During the first three months of 2009 convection was suppressed along the equator from west of Nauru across Western Kiribati to the date line, while the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) was further south and west of its mean location, extending from Papua New Guinea and northeastern Queensland to the New Caledonia archipelago (165\u00b0E). This La Ni\u00f1a dipole was less intense, and the area of maximum convective activity was not as spread out as during 2008, when the La Ni\u00f1a event resulted in the SPCZ expanding as far southeast as the Southern Cook Islands (160\u00b0W). In April 2009, the SPCZ shifted eastward, contributing to enhanced convective activity from Wallis and Futuna (175\u00b0W) to the Austral Islands (150\u00b0W). In May, the SPCZ weakened significantly, stalling over parts of Vanuatu, New Caledonia, and Fiji, southwest of its normal position. Concurrently, a zone of suppressed deep convection was present near Western Kiribati and south of the equator, extending east through Nauru and Eastern Kiribati. From June to October, the SPCZ stagnated southwest of its normal position and contracted toward Northern Papua New Guinea. Enhanced convection was largely absent from the region during the austral winter, while the area of suppressed convection contracted towards the central part of the Southwest Pacific, near Tokelau. During November and early December, above-average convective anomalies along a southwest-displaced SPCZ were seen near northern Vanuatu, northern Queensland, and the eastern edge of Papua New Guinea, before becoming established eastward across Western Kiribati, Fiji, Tonga, Austral Islands, and the Pitcairn Islands as El Ni\u00f1o conditions took hold. Suppressed convection was observed during November in the central part of the Southwest Pacific near Fiji and Samoa, before extending towards the northern Cook Islands and French Polynesia during December."}, {"section_title": "S173", "text": "juLY 2010 STATE OF THE CLIMATE IN 2009 | June saw large precipitation anomalies in southern Eastern Siberia and the southern Far East. In Sakhalin and the Maritime Territory where peak rainfall occurs in the latter half of summer with the monsoon, rainfall peaked in early June, with southern Sakhalin and the Ternei area of the Maritime Territory flooded due to frequent rains. Monthly precipitation was two to three times the average, with most of the rainfall occurring in just a few days, resulting in flooding. Such high early season rainfalls have never been observed before. Autumn was particularly wet over parts of eastern Russia. In Northern Caucasia, September was very rainy in the Krasnodar and Stavropol Territories and the Chechen Republic. Particularly heavy rains were recorded in Dagestan on 20-21 September, causing mud flows, river floods, and significant economic damage. October was also very rainy on the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk. Ayan, for example, received more than five times its monthly average rainfall. Typhoon Melor brought heavy rainfall and hurricanestrength winds (up to 144 km hr -1 ) to the Southern Kuril Islands. During November, precipitation was significantly above normal in Dagestan for the second month running. Makhachkala, for example, received more than 500% of its normal November rainfall, with avalanches in mountain regions. In December, the Kemerovo Region and the Republic of Altai received more than double their monthly normal rainfall. In Chukotka, very warm conditions (anomalies between +9\u00b0C and +10\u00b0C) were accompanied by rainfall that was twice the long-term average. Even more precipitation fell in the southern Khabarovsk Territory and the Maritime Territory, where some meteorological stations recorded 400%-600% of their monthly mean.

Na Countries considered in this section include: China, Korea, Japan, and Mongolia. In the first half of 2009, anticyclonic anomalies in the upper troposphere were dominant over China, a pattern which is consistent with the La Ni\u00f1a event early in the year. During the boreal summer, the subtropical jet stream became stationary, with a ridge over China and a trough over the Korean Peninsula, significantly affecting conditions over the region. Likewise, a trough became dominant over Mongolia and China during November and December. Over most of East Asia, the annual mean surface air temperature during 2009 was near or above normal, with the notable exception of northeastern China (Fig.7.40). Temperatures for most of East Asia were significantly above normal during February, May, and June, while significantlybelow-normal temperatures were observed over eastern China and Mongolia during November and December. Annual precipitation totals were above normal on the Pacific side of northern Japan, eastern to central China, and Hai Nan Island. In contrast, precipitation was below normal on the Pacific side of western Japan, in Okinawa/Amami, over southern and western China, and around Mongolia ( Fig. 7.41).

Rainfall in spring was also well below average, with Mosul receiving just 52% of their normal spring total and Baghdad just 36%. However, an unsettled period of weather during September and October led to above-average rainfall in many places.

Watkins Australia experienced its second warmest year on record in 2009, featuring three exceptional and widespread heat waves. It was the warmest year on record for the states of South Australia and New South   Wales. The warmth was particularly marked in the second half of the year, coinciding with a transition from La Ni\u00f1a to El Ni\u00f1o conditions. Nationallyaveraged rainfall was close to normal, with a very wet summer in many tropical areas being followed by generally drier-than-normal conditions from March to November. (i) Temperature Australia had its second warmest year on record in 2009 with a national anomaly of +0.90\u00b0C, only behind the +1.06\u00b0C record mean temperature anomaly observed in 2005. Both maximum and minimum temperatures were well above normal, with anomalies of +1.04\u00b0C (third highest) and +0.76\u00b0C (fifth highest), respectively. South Australia (mean temperature anomaly +1.26\u00b0C) and New South Wales (+1.32\u00b0C) each had their warmest year ever, breaking records set in 2007, while Victoria (+1.02\u00b0C) ranked second behind 2007. Maximum temperatures were generally above normal almost throughout the country (Fig. 7.49). Anomalies exceeded +1\u00b0C over most of mainland Australia south of the tropics except for southern Western Australia. The largest anomalies, mostly between +1.5\u00b0C and +2\u00b0C, were in inland areas of New South Wales and southern Queensland, as well as in an area straddling the Western Australia-Northern Territory border west of Alice Springs. Minimum temperatures were also above normal through most of Australia (Fig. 7.50), although they were below normal in most tropical areas of Queensland, as well as in scattered patches through Western Australia and the northern half of the Northern Territory. The largest anomalies (+1\u00b0C and +1.5\u00b0C), were in the southern and central inland, covering most of South Australia north of Port Au-gusta, New South Wales west of the Great Dividing Range, southwestern Queensland, and the southern Northern Territory. Early in the year there were marked temperature contrasts between northern and southern Australia. January and February were much cooler than normal in most of the tropics as a result of the very active wet season. Maximum temperatures were at least 2\u00b0C below normal for the period over much of tropical Queensland and the eastern Northern Territory, reaching up to 6\u00b0C below normal near Cloncurry. In contrast, temperatures were 2\u00b0C-3\u00b0C above normal in much of southern Australia, during a period which included the major heat wave of late January and early February (see sidebar). After being only slightly above normal (anomaly +0.28\u00b0C) for the first five months of the year, temperatures became sharply above normal from June onwards. The winter-spring (June-November) period (anomaly +1.22\u00b0C) was Australia's warmest on record by more than 0.3\u00b0C, as was the second half of the year (anomaly +1.22\u00b0C). Both August and November contained major heat waves, resulting in both months being the warmest on record for Australia (see sidebar).
