[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death among elderly in the United States (US). [1] Elderly also carry a disproportionate burden of lung cancer, as approximately 81% of those living with lung cancer are 60 years of age or older. [1] This pattern is expected to persist as the estimated number of elderly in the US doubles to approximately 70 million by 2030. [2] Therefore, its important to ensure that these patients receive quality cancer care. However, research to date has shown disparities in the receipt of appropriate lung cancer care among elderly. [3] The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recognizes timeliness of care as another important dimension of cancer care quality. [4,5] As lung cancer care requires complex coordination of services by oncology specialists, the traditional approach of referring patients for consultation with multiple specialists in a sequential fashion often results in care that is perceived slow. Therefore, standards for timely lung cancer care have been established, through clinical opinion-based guidelines, by the British Thoracic Society (BTS), the RAND Corporation, and by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP). [6][7][8] However, extensive studies in European Union countries have found delays in time to diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer than recommended in guidelines. [9] In the US, while similar delays have been reported by three studies in the Veteran Affairs setting, [10][11][12] one study from an military medical center reported no such delays in care. [13] Although guideline-concordant timely lung cancer care is important, its impact on survival remains unclear. While some studies from the European Union have reported poorer survival among patients with delayed care, [14][15][16] others have reported better survival among patients that received less timely care. [17][18][19][20] In the US, however, one study from the VA and another from an medical center reported no such association between timeliness of care and survival. [11,21] While these studies contribute valuable information to the literature, most of them have been conducted in non-US healthcare settings, [9] and of those conducted in the US have been limited to small sample sizes, included both elderly and non-elderly patients, were performed within specific health care settings, and were primarily restricted to Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients. [10][11][12][13]21] Therefore, a population-based analysis of patterns of guideline-concordant timely lung cancer care and associated survival among elderly patients in the US is much needed. To that end, the objectives of this study were to: (1) estimate the time intervals to lung cancer diagnosis and treatment among elderly patients; (2) estimate the receipt of and determine the predictors of guideline-concordant timely lung cancer care among elderly patients; and (3) evaluate the survival outcomes associated with receipt of guideline-concordant timely lung cancer care among elderly patients in the US."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data source", "text": "This study used National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked data files from years 2002-2007. SEER is a consortium of 20 population-based cancer registries covering ~28% of the US population and its data are representative of US cancer incidence and mortality. [22] Cancer registry data files provided clinical, demographic, cause of death, and initial treatment information for elderly individuals with lung cancer in selected geographic regions. The Medicare administrative data files provided the health service claims (utilization and reimbursement) information for care provided by physicians, inpatient hospital stays, hospital outpatient clinics, home health care agencies, skilled nursing facilities, and hospice programs."}, {"section_title": "Study Cohorts", "text": "We identified Medicare beneficiaries aged 66 years and older, with incident lung cancer diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O) codes: C34.0, C34.1, C34.2, C34.3, C34.8, C34.9, and C33.9; American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging (AJCC) Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) Stages: I-IV), during the years 2003 through 2006, in the SEER-Medicare data files ( Figure 1). [23] Given our intent to study timeliness of care and associated prognosis, we a priori restricted our cohort to patients with complete information on stage at diagnosis (i.e. Stage I-IV diagnosis). This resulted in exclusion of patients with missing information on stage at diagnosis (14.7%), approximately 16.6% of whom were diagnosed at death. Of the identified beneficiaries, we excluded those that were diagnosed only at death, had a prior malignancy, were enrolled in a managed care plan, or lacked Part A or B of Medicare. The resulting population cohort (Cohort A) was used to estimate time intervals to lung cancer diagnosis and treatment among beneficiaries. To estimate the receipt of and the predictors of guideline-concordant timely care among beneficiaries, we identified beneficiaries from Cohort A that received any treatment during the year following diagnosis (Cohort B). Given the limited years of follow-up data to evaluate the survival outcomes by receipt of guideline-concordant timely care, we further identified beneficiaries from Cohort B who had cancer diagnosis during the years 2003 and 2004 (Cohort C). The beneficiaries in Cohort C were then followed for three years following their cancer diagnosis to determine lung cancer specific mortality. Figure 2 shows a pictorial depiction of our approach to assessing time to diagnosis and treatment. Specifically, time to diagnosis was determined by following the patients during the year prior to the incident lung cancer diagnosis and were categorized as 'Symptom to Chest X-Ray (CXR)' interval, 'CXR to Specialist Visit' interval, 'Specialist' interval, and 'Referral' interval."}, {"section_title": "Assessing time to diagnosis and treatment", "text": "Given the retrospective nature of our data source, we determined the occurrence of earliest lung cancer symptoms by identifying the earliest Medicare claim (date), which had an International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code associated with either: (1) symptoms of primary tumor, (2) symptoms of intrathoracic spread, (3) symptoms of extrathoracic metastases, or (4) paraneoplastic syndromes (see Appendix A for complete list of symptoms). The comprehensive list of symptoms were derived from the ACCP guidelines for management and treatment of lung cancer. [24] The 'Symptom to CXR' interval was then defined as the time from the earliest Medicare claim date with lung cancer symptom, until the date of first Medicare claim for a CXR. The 'CXR to Specialist Visit' interval was defined as the time from the first Medicare claim for a CXR, until the date of first Medicare claim on which the service provider was a specialist, such as respiratory/chest physician, pulmonologist, oncologist, cardiologist, or thoracic/cardiac/regular surgeon. The 'Specialist' interval was defined as the time from the Medicare claim for the first specialist appointment until the date of cancer diagnosis. Among beneficiaries that were referred to a specialist, 'Referral' interval was defined as the time from the last Medicare claim associated with services provided by the referring physician, until the date of first Medicare claim on which the service provider was the referred specialist. The overall time to diagnosis, 'Symptom to Diagnosis' interval, was defined as the time from the earliest Medicare claim date with lung cancer symptom, until the date of cancer diagnosis. Specific time intervals to diagnosis were identified only among those patients who had Medicare claims associated with events of interest. Time to treatment was determined by following the patients for one year following incident lung cancer diagnosis. Specifically, 'Diagnosis to Treatment' interval was defined as the time from cancer diagnosis until the date of first Medicare claim for surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. Lung cancer specific treatments and procedures were identified from the Medicare claim data files using appropriate ICD-9-CM diagnosis and procedure codes, Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes, Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes and revenue center codes (see Appendix A)."}, {"section_title": "Assessing receipt of guideline-concordant timely lung cancer care", "text": "Guideline-concordant timely lung cancer care was defined using clinical opinion-based guidelines published by the BTS, and the RAND Corporation. [6,7] The British Thoracic Society recommends the time interval between diagnosis and treatment to be no more than eight weeks for surgery, seven weeks for radiotherapy, and four weeks for chemotherapy. [6] On the other hand, the RAND Corporation recommends any planned treatment to be offered within six weeks of the diagnosis date. [7] To incorporate recommendations from both sources, we defined timely care by selecting the maximum duration allowed under either source for a given type of treatment. Therefore, initial treatment was considered timely if the duration between diagnosis date and treatment date was no more than eight weeks for surgery, seven weeks for radiotherapy, and six weeks for chemotherapy."}, {"section_title": "Dependent variables", "text": "The primary outcome of interest, receipt of guideline-concordant timely lung cancer care, was categorized as 'Timely Care' or 'Delayed Care'. Survival time in days was calculated from the date of cancer diagnosis to the date of death or the three year follow-up cutoff date, which ever came first. SEER only provides the month and year of cancer diagnosis, therefore we approximated the date of cancer diagnosis by using the earliest Medicare claim date that had a lung cancer diagnosis code and which was in the SEER reported diagnosis month. This approximation is appropriate given the high level of agreement (~90%) within one month of diagnosis between the SEER diagnosis date and the first Medicare claim date with a cancer diagnosis. [25] If a patient had no Medicare claim with a lung cancer diagnosis code in the SEER reported month of diagnosis, the earliest date of any Medicare claim from that month was used. Finally, among patients with no Medicare claim in the SEER reported month of diagnosis, the date of diagnosis was approximated as the 15 th day of that month. Date of death was identified from Medicare enrollment records. To estimate lung cancer specific survival, patients not found to be deceased by the cutoff date, or who died due to causes other than lung cancer were censored at that time and considered to be alive."}, {"section_title": "Covariates", "text": "Based on prognostic significance, covariates included lung cancer type and stage, age at diagnosis, gender, race, urban-rural residence, comorbidity, and measures of socio-economic status.

Lung cancer stage was categorized based on AJCC TNM staging system. [23] Age at diagnosis was categorized as 66-69 years, 70-74 years, 75-79 years, and 80 years and older. Race was categorized as 'White' or 'Non-white'. Urban-rural residence was categorized as 'Metro', 'Urban', or 'Rural', using the Rural-Urban Continuum codes. Comorbidity was estimated using a modified Charlson comorbidity score, based on inpatient claims from the year preceding the cancer diagnosis. [26][27][28] This method of creating a weighted comorbidity score has previously been reported and used for both outcomes and patterns of care analysis.

Hierarchical generalized logistic model was constructed with PROC GLIMMIX procedure in SAS 9.2 to identify factors associated with receipt of guideline-concordant timely care among elderly patients. In the model, the estimated probability of a patient receiving guideline-concordant timely care conditioned on a set of predictor variables was modeled. The model treated census tract as a random effect to account for potential correlation among patients within the same county. Non-parametric estimates of the survivor function by receipt of guidelineconcordant timely care were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Survival differences were assessed using log-rank test. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to estimate lung cancer mortality risk associated with receipt of delayed care among elderly patients. To evaluate the proportional hazards assumption, we plotted smoothed Schoenfeld residuals against time and found no evidence of a systematic deviation from proportional hazards in the model. Variances in model was adjusted to account for patient clustering at the census tract level by the use of the robust inference of Lin and Wei. [29] All analysis were performed with SAS 9.2.

[5] Despite the fervor generated by this report, lung cancer disparities still exist in the US and may be attributed to variations in quality of cancer care. While timelines of care has been identified by the IOM as an important dimension of cancer care quality, its impact on prognosis in elderly lung cancer patients in the US remains to be fully explored. To that end, this population-based analysis studied the patterns of guideline-concordant timely lung cancer care and prognosis among elderly patients in the US. Overall, time to lung cancer diagnosis and treatment ranged widely among elderly patients in the US. The median 'Symptom to Diagnosis' time interval of >6 months was longer than expected and could be minimized if all diagnostic investigations are planned during the initial visit to a physician. On the other hand, the median 'Diagnosis to Treatment' time interval was more or less similar to that reported in prior studies. [10][11][12]21] Surgically treated patients had longer delays than those treated non-surgically, a difference that is likely to reflect the extra time needed to refer patents to thoracic surgeon for additional treatment consideration. A multidisciplinary team approach involving both surgeons and oncologist in the care process may help to minimize such delay. [8] Guideline-concordant timely lung cancer care was received by most patients and was highest among those receiving radiotherapy. Receipt of timely care also differed by patients clinical and socio-demographic characteristics. Specifically, patients with NSCLC or early stage disease were less likely to receive timely care, compared to those with SCLC or late stage disease. This finding is likely as patients with limited disease may have to wait significantly longer for treatment than those with advanced disease. [8] The finding also indicates that severity of disease at presentation may influence the speed of medical decision-making process. Contrary to results from a previous study, increasing patient age was inversely associated with receipt of timely care in this study. [30] However, these results corroborate finding by Simunovic and colleagues, [31] and may reflect less aggressive treatment approach by physicians in the elderly, given the impact on patients morbidity and quality of life. Similar to results found in prior studies, comorbidity was inversely associated with receipt of timely care. [17,31] This is expected as comorbidity is known to complicate treatment decision making in the elderly. Contrary to previous studies, household income was positively associated with the likelihood of receipt of timely care. [30][31][32][33] However, patient's gender and urban-rural residence were not associated with receipt of timely care; a finding similar to that reported in previous studies. [31,33] This study is one of the few that have assessed the influence of guideline-concordant timely lung cancer care on survival outcomes. Contrary to our expectation, the results of this study indicate that timely care is associated with poorer prognosis in elderly lung cancer patients in the US. This result corroborate findings from previous studies, [17][18][19][20] but contradict the findings from two US studies. [11,21] The observed paradoxical results may be explained by selection bias, as symptomatic patients with advanced stage disease are more likely to receive prompt (timely) care, despite their poor prognosis to begin with. Similar to findings from prior studies, the association between timely care and poor survival outcomes was most pronounced in patients with advanced stage disease. [19] However, we did notice a trend toward better survival outcomes with timely care among patients with early stage disease (Stage I/II), although the results were not significant. Further research is needed to explore the association between timely care and survival in patients with early stage disease, compared to those with late stage disease. The findings from this study are subject to several limitations. Although we used cancer registry linked claims data, an inherent limitation of using administrative claims data for epidemiologic studies is the possibility of misclassification as a result of coding errors. [34] However, claims data have been evaluated for their utility as a source of epidemiologic or health services information in cancer patients. [34] Increasing the use of these types of data to assess the quality of cancer care has also been identified as a priority by the IOM. The results of this study are generalizable to the Medicare Fee-for-service (FFS) population aged 66 years and older, as data for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in the managed care plan were not available for this study. Continuous enrollment in Medicare Part A and B was necessary for this study, therefore beneficiaries with non-continuous/intermittent enrollment were excluded. Information on care received by beneficiaries outside of the Medicare system, or through non-Medicare providers, was not available for this study. Given the limitations in our data source, the time to diagnosis and treatment were defined using Medicare claim date and may not be exact. Furthermore, retrospective review of claims to identify earliest lung cancer symptoms was limited to the year prior to diagnosis, as findings from previous research have shown 'Symptom to Diagnosis' time intervals to be less than a year. [9] Our estimates of 'Symptom to Diagnosis' time interval may be biased as patients in whom earliest symptom date could not be identified were excluded in calculating the time interval. It is less likely that we missed any reported lung cancer symptom as we searched for a comprehensive list of symptoms, derived from the ACCP guidelines for management and treatment of lung cancer (Appendix A). [24] Overall, date of earliest lung cancer symptom was identified in 90% of the patients in this study. We recognize that the earliest symptom identified in this study may have been unrelated to lung cancer. It is for these reasons we excluded 'Symptom to Diagnosis' time interval in our analysis of guidelineconcordant timely lung cancer care and prognosis. We acknowledge that our definition of timely care may be too narrow, and that given the heterogeneity of patients seen by physicians, receipt of delayed care or no care may still be considered appropriate. Furthermore, the criticality of timely care may vary by treatment intent (curative vs. palliative). This relationship, however, could not be explored in our study due to: (1) lack of information in our data source, and (2) lack of specific guidelines for timely care by treatment's intent. None the less, cancer type and stage were used as covariates in our analysis to account for the variation in disease severity and the resulting treatment variation. It should be noted that, given the intent of this study, a small proportion of patients (14.7%) with missing information on stage at diagnosis were excluded a priori from our analysis; few of these patients (16.6%) were diagnosed at death. Despite the above limitations, our definition of timely care provides a conceptual framework to assess and compare patterns of care that were prevalent during the years 2002-2007. Future studies can overcome the barriers seen in this study by collecting data on physician treatment choice, patient treatment preferences, clinical test information, and individual-level measures of socio-economic status. In summary, variations in lung cancer care among elderly patients continue to exist in the nation. Although clinical opinion-based guidelines for timely lung cancer care have been published by various organizations, their adoption in clinical practice remains limited. The resulting disparities in receipt of guideline-concordant timely lung cancer care may partly explain the disproportionate burden of this disease among the elderly. Although timely care was not associated with better prognosis in this study, any delays in diagnosis and treatment should be avoided, as it may increase the risk of disease progression and psychological stress in patients. Furthermore, given that lung cancer diagnostic and management services are covered under the Medicare program, observed delays in care among Medicare beneficiaries is also a cause for concern. Interventions aimed at increasing patient awareness of lung cancer symptoms and improving coordination of care among providers may help to reduce the delays in diagnosis and treatment among elderly patients in the US."}, {"section_title": "Supplementary Material", "text": "Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.
