Dept. of Natural Resources). Subsequent growth in field size, specialization in crop production, and further loss in grasslands have contributed to a subsequent decrease in pheasant populations. For example, pheasant populations in South Dakota fell from an estimated 16 million in the mid 1940s to less than two million by 1986 (S.D. Dept. of Game, Fish, and Parks) . Even so, the pheasant remains the most popular game bird in the Midwest (U.S. Dept. of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service) .\nTitle XII of the 1985 Food Security Act authorized the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) to reverse the adverse environmental effects of farming practices. Although the Act focused on the protection of the Nation's most erodible and fragile cropland in the field selection process, it also included the consideration of a number of additional LeRoy Hansen, Peter Feather, and David environmental impacts (USDA, 1986) . 1 Following the 1990 farm bill, the additional conservation impacts became part of the CRP's field selection process.\nThe objective of this analysis is to empirically value the impact of farm programs and practices on the quality of pheasant hunting. The approach employed here provides location-specific benefit estimates. Use of location-specific benefits has the potential to improve farm program decisions in two ways. First, such benefits can be used to improve the design and implementation of a program. And second, an estimate of the total welfare impact of a farm program is likely to be more accurate when totaled from the micro-level impacts. To obtain the location-specific benefit estimates: 1) observations on individuals are used to estimate the demand for pheasant hunting as opposed to the supply-demand equilibrium models used in previous national environmental assessments (Ribaudo, et al.; Hansen and Hallam) and 2) a Geographic Information System is employed to maximize the resolution of the geographic data used to characterize site attributes.\nThe discussion below will first describe the behavioral model and the estimation method applied.\nAfter a review of the data, variables, and model's application to pheasant hunting, the estimation results are presented and their implications are summarized. The model is used to estimate the annual pheasant-hunting benefits generated by the CRP under current program acreage and under the likely distribution of acreage if all acreage had been selected based on criteria of a recent signup. These two evaluations of the pheasant hunting benefits of the CRP demonstrate how the estimated model can both evaluate the program's benefits and evaluate a redistribution of the program acres with an alternative program design."}, {"section_title": "Behavioral Model", "text": "changes in seasonal participation. To accomplish this, the second stage participation model is employed. The participation model models the individual's trip demand as a function of the expected price, E(P), and expected site attributes, E(a), given the site options that the individual faces. To derive E(P) and E(w), we first use equation 2 to estimate IIj, the probability of visiting site j, for all n sites the individual faces. Then, with Pj, aj, and IIj, the expected site attributes are:\nThe basic behavioral framework employed is the travel cost demand model where demand is estimated as a two-stage decision process similar to that developed by Feather, Hellerstein, and Tomasi. The first stage random utility model (RUM) allows each individual to choose from multiple sites. The second stage participation model allows each individual to choose the level of participation,\nIn the first stage, the site-selection stage, the utility from a single trip is:\n(1) Vj+ej=xjp+ej where Vj is the systematic component of utility that the individual receives from site j. The systematic component is dependent on the site attribute variables (Xj) and a vector of coefficient parameters (~). Commonly, Xj includes site attributes such as the associated travel cost and measures of site quality. The random component of the individual's utility or the error term,~j, is known to the individual but not to the investigator.\nThe parameters of the RUM are estimated from observations on the visited site(s) and characteristics of all potential sites, Assuming that the ej's are iid extreme value with mean zero and a unit scale parameter, the probability of an individual visiting a site j, IIP is estimated with a multinominal logit model:\nwhere n is the number of sites availed to the individual. The RUM allows for the individual's substitution among site alternatives given site attributes. However, it cannot predict subsequent\nThe expected site attributes are estimated for every individual and used in the participation model. Being a demand model, the participation model will also depend on characteristics of the individual, Y, thus is given as\nWith the integer nature of the dependent variable representing the number of pheasant hunting trips, a count data model is most appropriate when estimating D(.E(P),Y,E(ct)). Because the dependent variable has nonnegative integer values that are significantly skewed toward zero, a Poisson Count Model is most appropriate (Hellerstein; Creel and Loomis; Englin and Shonkwiler) . Conceptually, the number of trips an individual takes, t, is assumed to be a random draw from a Poisson distribution with mean k so that. Next, h for an individual is assumed to be a function of the vector of parameters, 17,and the participation demand variables, W = {E(P),Y,E(a) }, so that:\nEquations 4 and 5 are the standard formulation of the Poisson regression model (Haab and McConnell) .

The total change in consumer surplus is the sum of ACS across the relevant population."}, {"section_title": "Pheasant Hunting: Data and Variables", "text": "While agriculture affects many wildlife species, this study looks at pheasants for two reasons, First, as mentioned previously, the pheasant is the most popular upland game bird throughout the Midwest (U.S. Dept. of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service). Second, pheasants are sensitive to changes in uses of agricultural lands. Specialization in production and the increased use of insecticides and herbicides have cost pheasants cover and food sources thereby reducing nesting success and chick survival(Jahn; Messicket al,, Minn. Dept. of Natural Resources; Warner (1979; 1984) ; Warner, Etter, Joselyn, and Ellis; Hill; Basore, Best, and Wooley). Together, the popularity of the sport and the dependence of pheasants on agriculture suggest that the welfare impacts of changes in agricultural land uses may be very significant. Pheasant habitat is most suitable and their population most abundant in the Midwest (e.g., the Lake States of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota; the Corn Belt States of Iowa, Illinois, Ohio, Missouri, and Indiana; the Northern Plains States of the Dakotas, Nebraska, and Kansas; and Montana), an area representing more than half of all U.S. cropland.\nTo best estimate individuals' demands applicable in national policy analyses, one must make best use of available data and minimize the disadvantage(s) of any data shortcoming. In the discussion below, the available data are discussed along with an overview of advantages, shortcomings, and the approach used to overcome each shortcoming. Behavioral data are discussed first followed by details of the resource data. As a summary, the variables are defined."}, {"section_title": "Behavioral Data", "text": "Data on individuals' pheasant hunting were obtained from the 1991 survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife-Associated Recreation (FHWAR). This is a national survey on such things as equipment expenditures, respondent characteristics, days spent pheasant hunting, and the travel distance to the most commonly visited site. Based on survey responses, we selected a subsample inclusive of respondents who had hunted any species at least once within the past 10 years or thought they might hunt in the survey year. This subsample of 5,834 observations was thought to represent all potential hunters in the relevant (Midwestern) states.\nThere are a number of factors that must be considered when specifying the hunting quality of potential sites. Two characteristics of this amenity suggest that a site should be defined across miles. First, on a single hunting trip, an individual hunts on a collection of fields and these fields spread across a number of miles. Thus a site should include this collection of fields. Second, pheasants are known to move a few miles periodically as habitat needs arise (Warner and Etter 1985) . This means that hunting quality might be very good in com fields due to the good nesting habitat provided by CRP fields several miles away. Thus, because pheasant hunting quality at any one field can depend on land uses across a several-mile range, a site should include this broader array of habitats or fields relevant to the collection of fields hunted. While these two characteristics of the amenity suggest that the site should cover a number of miles, there is no certainty as to the appropriate number of miles. However, because the general pattern of farmland use within the study area (the com and wheat belts) tends to remain unchanged across 30-40 mile ranges, sites of multiple miles can be specified without loss in amenity variation.\nOne strength of the FHWAR data is that respondents' zip codes are available. Zip codes are relatively small geographic areas whose centroids provide reasonable gee-referencing points for site specification. The land surrounding a respondent would be his/her closest site. Given the distance traveled by pheasants and by hunters and the consistency of farmland use across wide areas, it seems reasonable to include land within 25 miles of a respondent as the closest site. The next closest sites are those beyond 25 miles but within 50 miles. There are three sites defined in the 25 to 50 mile range, five sites in the 50 to 75 mile range and seven sites in the 75 to 100 mile ranges (figure 1). Under this specification, 16 sites of equal size are generated for each zip code.2\nOne weakness of the 1991 FHWAR survey is that it does not provide data on the direction traveled. The survey does identify (1) the distance traveled and (2) the state where the hunting took place, For those trips less than 25 miles, direction does not make a difference since the closest site includes all land within 25 miles. And for some trips exceeding 25 miles, the information on the state in ring size. This approach provided very poor results in that coefficients on these resource variables were not significant. We believe that the poor results reflect the fact that land uses across a large land area are unrelated to the ecosystems' health. That is, by using the more aggregate site measures, the mixture of land uses can represent uses that are 150-200 miles apart and thus are not part of the same ecosystem. Although the variance terms are included to capture this effect, it is possible to have the same variance around different average measures; however, the effect of the variance is likely to be different in the two cases. Thus, in light of the results, we concluded that the mix of land uses on smaller sites would serve as the better indicator of the health of the pheasant ecosystem despite the identification problem. where the hunting took place helped determine the visited site. Together, this survey information allowed sites to be identified for approximately 70% of the observations. When more than one site fit the distance/state criteria, we used data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) to provide some basis for determining the selected site. The BBS provides surveyors' counts of birds species observed along designated routes on scheduled days.3 We assume the selected site to be the potential site with the highest BBS pheasant count.4 Although this approach is likely to assign some individuals to sites they did not visit, this is not expected to bias parameter estimates. This is because, for individuals assigned to the wrong site, there will be no correlation between that site's quality and other model variables. Admittedly, the standard errors of the site quality coefficient will be increased. In an alternative approach, each ring of sites is identified as a single site and resource quality is defined by the average and variance of the quality variables within the ring. A weighting scheme was employed to account for the variation\nThe 1992 National Resource Inventory (NRI) provides subcounty sample data on agricultural and nonagricultural land use. The 1990 Census of Population provides a measure of population densities. Population density is thought-to represent crowding, which is assumed to adversely affect the individual's pheasant hunting demand, The NRI subcounties. census tracts. and BBS surveyor route each represent different geographic areas. Each is also different from the sites defined in this study. To convert the NRI, Census, and BBS data into site data, a Geographic Information System (GIS) was employed. For each NRI, Census, and BBS variable, the average shifted histogram (ASH) technique was used to estimate a \"surface\" of values based on the variable's surrounding values (Scott and Whittaker) . That is, variable values are estimated at specific grid points. The grid scale used here is approximately 3,9 miles which means values are estimated for each variable every 3.9 miles horizontally and vertically. Thus a plot of a variable's estimated values across the grid points generates a 3-dimensional surface. A surface is generated for each NRI, census, and BBS variable. The attributes of each site are derived from these surfaces. Specifically, values at the grid point closest to a site's center are assumed to reflect the attributes of the whole site.\nBiological studies have yet to model agricultural's impacts on pheasant populations. With no biological model, a \"reduced-form\" model is employed (see footnote 3). The reduced-form model is a combined biological-behavioral model, The reduced-form model uses the habitat variables that are determinants of pheasant populations as independent variables. Coefficients on the habitat variables represent both the biological and the subsequent behavioral responses.\nSome indications of the appropriate variables for a reduced form model are offered by studies that have looked at agriculture's impacts on a single life stage. Together, these studies indicate that pheasant populations are affected by the portion of land in: hay and small grain crops which provide some nesting cover (HAYGRN), com and soybeans which provide feed but poor nesting cover (CRNSOY), pasture and range which also provide a degree of nesting cover (GRASS), forest land which is generally an unsuitable habitat (FOR-EST), and the permanent cover of the CRP which provides good nesting and winter cover and insects for newly hatched chicks (CRP) (USDA 1989a; Warner and Etter 1986; Jahn; Kimmel et al.) .5 There are other croplands (OTHCROP) that are expected to provide a reasonable habitat relative to the variety of non-agricultural uses not modeled such as residential/urban areas, water bodies, parks etc. Since FOREST represents an unsuitable pheasant habitat, it is likely to negatively affect hunting quality. However, the suitable habitat can become unsuitable should it become too dominant among land uses. Field research has shown that the 25% limit on CRP land in any one county appears to ensure that wildlife habitat does not become too dominant (Kimmel et al.) . Thus diminishing and, except for CRP, negative returns are expected of the suitable habitat variables.\nTogether, these variables allow the systematic component of utility in the RUM to be specified as V(COST, CRP, HAYGRN, CRNSOY, FOREST, GRASS, OTHCROP, POP) where COST represents the site's round trip travel costs and POP represents the density of people living within the site.6\nFrom the RUM, the expected cost, E(P), and the 5 The small @rrs included are oats, barley, and wheat. 6 Travel cost includes both the round trip time aad mileage costs. Time costs is based on the opportunity cost of an hour of time multiplied by the estimated travel time. The opportunity cost of rime is set at one ttdrd tbe hourly wage and the hourly wage equals anorral income/2000 hours per year. Travel time is estimated by dividkrg the distance traveled by an average speed of 42 mph where 42 mph is the average rate of speed of respondents traveled in a recent recreation survey (Feather, Hellerstein, and Tomasi) . Mileage costs are set at the American Automobile Association's estimated $0.30 per mile. There are two weaknesses in the AAA vehicle cost: first, it includes the fixed costs of insurance and vehicle depreciation; and second, it represents costs of the 'average' car although hunters commonly use pickups and sport utility vehicles-vehicles known to have bigher operating costs. Since these costs could be offsetting and with no established means of correcting the AAA measure for either of these factors, we though it reasonable to go with the AAA's $.30hnile estimate expected land use, E(a), are estimated and used with the socioeconomic data to estimate the participation model, D(E(P),Y,E(cx)). The socioeconomic variables, Y, include MALE, RURAL, ED12, ED16, AGE, and INCOME which indicate the respondent as male, as having completed high school, as having completed college, and the respondent's age and income."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Results and Policy Evaluation", "text": "All coefficients in the RUM have the expected signs and are significant at the 9990 confidence level (table 1). The natural log is taken of the CRP variable and second degree terms are included for other land use variables to allow for diminishing and negative marginal effects. All coefficients on variables of the participation model are significant at the 9090 confidence level; all but three are significant at the 99~0 level. The signs on coefficients of the socioeconomic variables are as expected except for the negative coefficient on RURAL. Because people living in rural areas are thought to be more likely to hunt, the coefficient on RURAL was expected to be positive. However, since travel costs are likely to be lower for people living in the rural areas, the model results may still be consistent with the notion that people in rural areas hunt more. All suitable habitat variables have their expected signs. Acreage in GRASS and OTHCROP remained low and may explain why their diminishing impacts did not become significant. The significance of diminishing returns to CRNSOY in the RUM suggests that the marginal decision to hunt is affected by increasing portions of land in corn and soybeans but the lack of diminishing returns in the participation model indicates the marginal decision of days to hunt is not so sensitive to changes in the portion of land in CRNSOY. The forest variables also have their expected signs.\nTo calculate total consumer surplus, estimates of E(P) and E(a) are derived from the RUM based on the observed land use variables around each individual. Then, E(P), E(a), and the respondent's personal characteristics are used in the participation model (equation 6) to derive each individual's consumer surplus. Each respondent's consumer surplus is then multiplied by the observation weight and the product summed across all respondents. The annual consumer surplus enjoyed by pheasant hunters in the study area was found to total $184 million.\nWith approximately eight million days spent pheasant hunting in the study area, consumer sur- is a zero-one dummy variable equal to one when the respondent is male; is a zero-one dummy variable equal to one when respondent views residences in a rural area; is the age of the respondent; is a zero-one dummy variable equal to one when the respondent's has completed high school but not college, is a zero-one dummy variable equal to one when the respondent has completed college; is annual household income. is INCOME squared. is the sample weight of the observation; WEIGHTSQ is Wt31GH-T squm-ed.\n1Actual values of the amenity variable are used in the RUM model and expected values used in the participation model. 't-statistic for tAe null hypothesis that the parameter equals zero appear in parentheses, 3WEIGHT and WEIGHTSQ are included to insure equality between actuat and predicted trips. This means of model adjustment bas more intuitive appeal than (1) ignoring the problem, (2) using a weighted estimator, or (3) computing and employing a calibration factor that would force equality of actual and predicted trips. (Walsh, Johnson, and McKean) . Thus the $23-perday estimate derived here is consistent with the more conservative of the earlier estimates. To determine the consumer surplus attributable to the CRP, several steps were taken. First, the appropriate subsequent land use needed to be determined, In this study, it was assumed that CRP acres would return to their prior use as given in the 1982 NRI. Next, with this information, the GIS was used to estimate land use variables at each site. These new land use variables were used in the RUM model to generate new site choice probabilities and the subsequent steps are as discussed above. As a result, if there was no land in the CRP, consumer surplus would total $104 million annually. This $80 million reduction is an estimate of the consumer surplus attributable to the CRP, This translates to approximately $4.10 per acre when these benefits are averaged over the study area's 19.5 million CRP acres. Of course, per-acre benefits do vary depending on the surrounding land uses and the proximity of potential hunters. These factors vary significantly enough to cause regional variation in average benefits. Within the Corn Belt/ Lake States, the per-acre benefits average $6.46 but average only $3.00 per acre in the Northern Plains. Previous research on the CRP'S benefit to small game-hunters found relatively higher benefits in the Corn Belt/Lake State (Ribaudo et al.) . This regional variation is thought to be due, primarily, to relative number of people affected.\nLand is selected into the CRP based on a broad set of environmental goals. Furthermore, land rents also are considered. Thus while pheasant hunting benefits are much higher in the CornBelt/Lake States relative to the Northern Plains, other environmental benefits and the differences in CRP rental payments may well justify such a distribution.\nWhen the CRP was first implemented, soil erosion control was the sole environmental eligibility requirement used to select program acres (USDA, 1989b) . After passage of the 1990 farm bill, farmland offered for program enrollment was screened for a number of environmental improvements including: ground and surface water quality improvements, wildlife habitat improvements, the reduction in airborne soil particulate, reduced soil erosion, and an increase in forested land. Since the FHWAR survey data were collected in 1991 and most CRP acreage in 1991 had been enrolled in 10-15 year contracts prior to the 1990 farm bill, the estimated pheasant hunting benefits generally reflect the CRP acreage distribution that resulted when soil erosion control was the sole environmental factor used in selecting CRP acres.\nThe farmland selection procedure used after the 1990 farm bill, first, screens each CRP contract bid and rejects any having a proposed rental rate that exceeds the current soil-specific rental rate; second, awards points according to an Environmental Benefit Index (EBI); and third, maximizes the EBI scores across bids at the national level (Osbom 1997; Osbom et al. 1995) . EBI points or scores are designed to be positively related to the environmental improvements and negatively related to the bid's proposed rental rate.\nTo determine the welfare impact to pheasant hunters if all CRP acres had been selected using an EBI instead of the erosion criteria used prior to 1991, we simulated a hypothetical enrollment based on the selection and cost criteria of the 1997 EBI.8 Total program enrollment was constrained to the 34 million acres of the observation year. Qualified acres were identified using a simulation technique developed by Osborn (1993) that selects those acres (or NRI observations) that meet basic eligibility criteria, have high EBI scores, and are likely to become a contract bid. This last factorthat they are likely to become a contract bid-was based on partial budgeting and the acre's current use (i.e., irrigated land is not likely to be offered as a CRP contract since program rental rates are dry land rates). Consequently, some but not all NRI observations (or acres) now in the CRP fell out of the program while other acres were added. NRI acres leaving the CRP were assumed to return to their pre-CRP use as identified in the 1982 NRI. The GIS was then used to generate land use estimates at grid points from which land uses at sites were derived.\nUnder this hypothetical distribution, results suggest that the consumer surplus to pheasant hunters would fall $10 million to $70 million or $3.57 per CRP-acre (table 2) . This result likely reflects the changes in the distribution of CRP acres-a distribution that would likely increase the travel costs for pheasant hunting. Specifically, the CRP acreage in the Northern Plains falls by close to one million acres while lesser populated parts of Montana gain one million acres. The Corn Belt loses more than 600,000 acres to increased enrollment in the less populated Lake States.\nDespite this fall in consumer surplus, one cannot make any conclusions on what enrollment under this 1997 signup would do to total pheasant populations. This is because changes in pheasant popu- lations can have different impacts on consumer surplus in different parts of the country, For example, an increase in enrollment in one area can significantly increase pheasant populations but if travel costs to this area are high, the resulting gain in consumer surplus may be small. Conversely, a decrease in enrollment in another area may cause only a small decrease in pheasant populations but if travel costs are low, the loss in consumer surplus might be large. Thus changes in total consumer surplus and changes in total pheasant populations need not be correlated. However, it is clear that the benefits of the CRP to pheasant hunters will depend, in large part, on the distribution of program acres. The acreage selection process has changed in the past and is likely to continue to evolve, Thus the evaluation of program benefits can be used to assess the welfare impacts of the program and to assess potential and actual changes in the farmland selection criteria."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "This analysis estimated individuals' demand for pheasant hunting recognizing the multi-site nature of the decision to hunt. The estimated model was used to value the impact of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) on pheasant hunting quality. We also estimated how consumer surplus associated with pheasant hunting would change if all CRP acres were re-selected according to criteria of a recently developed Environmental Benefit Index (EBI), With the estimates of individuals' demands for changes in environmental quality, the welfare impacts of farm programs are likely to be more accurately quantified as more micro-level program characteristics are accounted for in demand estimation as opposed to the supply-demand equilibrium models used in previous national analyses (Ribaudo et al.; Hansen and Hallam) . Furthermore, the more geographically-specific benefit estimates allow welfare impacts of intercounty changes in laud distributions to be assessed. The ability to evaluate intercounty changes in land use can contribute to evaluation of the design and operation of farm programs. Critical to this research was the use of the Geographic Information System (GIS) which improved the resolution of the geographic data so that site attributes are more accurately assessed and individual demands could then be estimated, Our analysis had to overcome a lack of detail on exactly where the individual hunted; in a minority of cases, we were forced to 'guess' from potential sites. Our analysis also faced a lack of adequate biological models linking land uses/ecosystem characteristics to pheasant populations; we applied a reduced form model where measures of the agricultural and nonagricultural uses of land serve as independent variables. Alternative means were employed to overcome each of these problems but results indicated that the selected approach was most appropriate.\nThe total consumer surplus associated with pheasant hunting was estimated at $184 million per year. Of this, $80 million is attributed to the CRP. If all CRP land were to be redistributed based on a recently developed EBI, consumer surplus to pheasant hunters would fall by $10 million mmually. This reduction in program benefits is thought to reflect the greater travel costs associated with sites where hunting quality would improve. However, it is important to note that, while pheasant hunting benefits were simulated to be lower, there are other environmental benefits relevant to agricultural programs and practices. Benefits of waterbased recreation and of nonconsumptive wildlifeassociated recreation have been assessed and were found to more than offset this loss (Feather, Hellerstein, and Hansen) . While these, along with pheasant hunting benefits, do not provide a comprehensive assessment of impacts, they do provide frameworks applicable to valuing some of the other nonmarket impacts of agriculture."}]
