Yet limited work has evaluated the association between APOE alleles and markers of AD neuropathology in a sex-specific manner.\nOBJECTIVE To evaluate sex differences in the association between APOE and markers of AD neuropathology measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during life or in brain tissue at autopsy.\nThis multicohort study selected data from 10 longitudinal cohort studies of normal aging and AD. Cohorts had variable recruitment criteria and follow-up intervals and included population-based and clinic-based samples. Inclusion in our analysis required APOE genotype data and either CSF data available for analysis. Analyses began on November 6, 2017, and were completed on December 20, 2017.\nBiomarker analyses included levels of \u03b2-amyloid 42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau measured in CSF. Autopsy analyses included Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease staging for neuritic plaques and Braak staging for neurofibrillary tangles.\nOf the 1798 patients in the CSF biomarker cohort, 862 were women, 226 had AD, 1690 were white, and the mean (SD) age was 70 [9] years. Of the 5109 patients in the autopsy cohort, 2813 were women, 4953 were white, and the mean (SD) age was 84 (9) years. After correcting for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni procedure, we observed a statistically significant interaction between APOE-\u03b54 and sex on CSF total tau (\u03b2 = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.27-0.55; P < .001) and phosphorylated tau (\u03b2 = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.09-0.38; P = .001), whereby APOE showed a stronger association among women compared with men. Post hoc analyses suggested this sex difference was present in amyloid-positive individuals (\u03b2 = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.20-0.62; P < .001) but not among amyloid-negative individuals (\u03b2 = 0.06; 95% CI, \u22120.18 to 0.31; P = .62). We did not observe sex differences in the association between APOE and \u03b2-amyloid 42, neuritic plaque burden, or neurofibrillary tangle burden.\nWe provide robust evidence of a stronger association between APOE-\u03b54 and CSF tau levels among women compared with men across multiple independent data sets. Interestingly, APOE-\u03b54 is not differentially associated with autopsy measures of neurofibrillary tangles. Together, the sex difference in the association between APOE and CSF measures of tau and the lack of a sex difference in the association with neurofibrillary tangles at autopsy suggest that APOE may modulate risk for neurodegeneration in a sex-specific manner, particularly in the presence of amyloidosis."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "tangle pathology.\n11 This article will focus on amyloid and tau as potential contributors to sex differences in the clinical effects of APOE.\nIn the case of amyloid pathology, APOE-\u03b54 has a strong association with amyloidosis, 8, 9 even among older adults without dementia, 12 likely through its role in amyloid clearance. 13 Research leveraging in vivo biomarkers of amyloid has indicated that the association between APOE-\u03b54 and amyloidosis is consistent across sexes, 8,14-16 yet other work has found evidence of age-dependent sex differences in the effects of APOE-\u03b54 on amyloidosis. 17, 18 In the case of tau pathology, APOE-\u03b54 is associated with higher levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau 19 and more neurofibrillary tangles at autopsy, 11 although these associations are relegated to individuals with high levels of amyloid pathology. 16 The evidence of a sex difference in the association between APOE and tau pathology is also mixed, with some biomarker 15, 19 and autopsy 18 work suggesting women show a more robust association between APOE-\u03b54 and tau, while other work has reported no sex difference. 14, 20, 21 Collectively, the amyloid and tau findings to date provide mounting, although inconclusive, evidence of a sex difference in the association between APOE and both of the primary neuropathological hallmarks of AD. The objective of this study was to provide a comprehensive understanding of the sex-specific associations between APOE and AD neuropathology in older adulthood. The pooled data resources for this project provide the opportunity to evaluate sex differences across the spectrum of normal aging and AD including a broad range of age and cognitive status. The first set of analyses focused on 4 in vivo data sets that include CSF biomarkers of AD neuropathology. The second set focused on 6 autopsy data sets of AD leveraging direct measures of AD neuropathology.

Seventy-two percent (n = 1112) have a parent with either probable AD dementia ascertained through medical history review or autopsyconfirmed AD. 23 The Biomarkers of Cognitive Decline Among\nNormal Individuals study began in 1995. Enrollees were middle age at baseline and cognitively intact; 75% of participants (n = 266) had a first-degree relative with AD. The study stopped in 2005 and was reestablished in 2009, with annual assessments. 24 The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) launched in 2003 and includes more than 1500 adults aged 55 to 90 years with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, or AD (http://www.adni-info.org). The autopsy database was derived from data published by Beecham et al 25 evaluating genetic markers of AD neuropathology, which includes cohort descriptions. 25 The Translational Genomics Research Institute, National Institute on Aging Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Family Study, and Mayo Clinic were analyzed directly from the published data. 25 The data set was updated using data from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project, the Adult Changes in Thought study, and the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center data set. Briefly, the Religious Orders Study began in 1994 and involves older Catholic nuns, priests, and brothers recruited from across the United States. Rush Memory and Aging Project began in 1997 and involves older lay persons recruited from retirement communities, subsidized housing facilities, and social service agencies in the Chicago, Illinois, metropolitan area. Persons in both studies enrolled without dementia and agreed to annual clinical evaluations and organ donation at death. 26, 27 The Adult Changes in Thought began in 1994 and recruited a random sample of older adults without dementia from the Seattle, Washington, metropolitan area. A subset of participants in Adult Changes in Thought (25%-30%) also agreed to brain donation. 28 The National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center maintains a database of participant information collected from 34 past and present National Institute of Aging-funded Alzheimer's Disease Centers.

Both measures were analyzed as binary outcomes and as ordinal outcomes.

The observed sex difference was driven by amyloid-positive individuals, suggesting APOE may confer sex-specific risk for downstream neurodegeneration in the presence of enhanced amyloidosis. In contrast to CSF tau levels, we did not observe sex differences in the association between APOE and any biomarkers of amyloidosis or autopsy measures of neurofibrillary tangles. These analyses provide strong evidence of an enhanced association between APOE-\u03b54 and CSF tau levels among women compared with men, particularly among amyloid positive women. Previous work in ADNI has reported similar sex differences in CSF tau, 14,20 although results have been somewhat mixed depending on the sample included 21 and had never been replicated in an independent cohort. We were able to replicate the sex difference of APOE effects on CSF tau in 3 additional data sets that differ substantially in baseline age and diagnostic status. We also provide evidence of a comparable sex difference in the association between APOE-\u03b54 and CSF phosphorylated tau for the first time. Several mechanisms could underlie this sex difference in tau, and the hormonal changes that take place during and following menopause represent 1 strong candidate pathway. For example, there is evidence that changes in estrogen levels among women could drive a more severe downstream response to amyloidosis, 35-37 an effect that could be enhanced among \u03b54 carriers given evidence that estradiol treatment drives APOE release from microglia. 38 A second possibility is that late-life changes in estrogen levels among women have a direct effect on tau. For example, estradiol appears to protect against tau hyperphosphorylation, particularly among female rats, 39 and estrogen receptor \u03b1 colocalizes with neurofibrillary tangles at autopsy. 40 Interestingly, the \u03b1 receptor also appears to be responsible for the estrogen-mediated upregulation of APOE expression, 41 suggesting a third possible mechanism in which estrogen and APOE act synergistically in postmenopausal women. Thoughtful, modern experimental approaches are needed to better understand the potential contribution of gonadal hormone differences between men and women in driving the observed APOE sex differences."}, {"section_title": "42", "text": "In contrast to the CSF biomarker results, we did not observe a sex difference in the association between APOE and neurofibrillary tangle load at autopsy.

Therefore, 1 possibility is that sex-specific effects of APOE contribute to differences in neurodegeneration that are not directly mediated by changes in neurofibrillary tangle burden. Other markers of neurodegeneration, including hippocampal volume 44, 45 and cerebral hypometabolism, 21 show sex-specific effects of APOE-\u03b54 that may underlie the observed differences in CSF tau levels. A second possibility is that the age difference between the autopsy cohorts and biomarker cohorts in this analysis contribute to the observed discrepancy between CSF and autopsy measures of tau. Evidence indicates that both the detrimental effect of APOE-\u03b54 and the sex difference in APOE-\u03b54 effect diminishes among the oldest elderly individuals, 3,4 suggesting that subtle age differences could have a large influence on results. In support of such a possibility, we do observe the strongest effects on CSF tau in the younger individuals when stratifying the CSF sample into younger elderly and older elderly adults (eTables 3 and 4 in the Supplement). However, even among the younger elderly adults, we did not observe a sex-specific effect of APOE on autopsy metrics, suggesting this age difference does not fully account for the discrepancy.\nIn all analyses, we observed a strong association between APOE and amyloidosis that was consistent across men and women. APOE appears to drive risk for clinical AD through an amyloid clearance pathway, 13 so it is not surprising that both\nhere and previously 46 APOE shows a stronger association with amyloid deposition than tau.

However, the study is not without limitations. One important limitation is the potential influence of sex differences in survival to older adulthood, which could contribute to a robust survivor effect amongmen compared with women. As others have previously highlighted, selective survival of men with substantially lower cardiovascular risk profiles may contribute to sex differences in AD risk in older adulthood. 49 It is also notable that the sex-specific effect of APOE-\u03b54 on microbleeds is actually in the inverse direction, 50 with men showing a stronger association than women, suggesting that sex-specific effects of APOE-\u03b54 may have differential effects on AD and non-AD pathologies, even in the face of potential survivor bias. Future work is needed to develop and integrate modern statistical approaches to estimate and account for the effect of survival bias, particularly in analyses of sex-specific molecular drivers of AD and non-AD neuropathologies. The cross-sectional nature of the biomarker and autopsy data also limits our ability to make causal inferences, particularly with respect to the sequential ordering of neuropathologies or CSF biomarker deposition. Finally, the cohorts were relatively homogeneous across race and ethnicity, with some cohorts being exclusively white. Thus, findings may not be generalizable to other racial and ethnic groups that may be at greater risk of AD. Results will need to be extended to cohorts with greater diversity."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "These results provide strong evidence of sex differences in the association between APOE and CSF tau levels that do not appear to reflect differences in neurofibrillary tangle deposition.
