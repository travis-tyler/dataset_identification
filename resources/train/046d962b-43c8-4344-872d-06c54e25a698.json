[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "This paper discusses the teacher efficacy factors contributing to student achievement in literacy and numeracy in 105 primary schools within Sibu division, Sarawak, Malaysia. The study observed high levels of practice for teacher efficacy. The t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to analyze the differences between gender, teaching experience and academic qualification. The study reported significant differences in respondent perceptions based on teaching experience. Here, the post hoc Tukey test revealed that efficaciousness grows with years of teaching experience. A correlation test observed a significant relationship between the independent variable with student achievement in literacy. Binary logistic regression was applied to predict the influence of teacher efficacy on literacy and numeracy. The findings revealed that a dimension of teacher self-efficacy -efficacy in student engagementemerged as the best predictor for student achievement for English literacy (LBI). The result indicated that for every 1-point increase in the self-reported efficacy for student engagement, the school was .014 times less likely to achieve 100% literacy rate for LBI. In conclusion, the teacher's self-efficacy in student engagement had a negative influence on the mastery of basic literacy for the English language, hence necessitating a closer inspection of the variable within the context of LINUS2.0. However, more comprehensive studies are needed to ascertain its consistency as well as investigating positive predictors for literacy."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The Malaysian Ministry of Education (MoE) established the Literacy and Numeracy Screening (LINUS) program in Malaysia in 2010 in response to the perceived inadequacy of existing educational approaches and strategies at the time to arrest illiteracy, despite the initiation of various remedial programs (Curriculum Development Division, 2015) . On the international front, similar programs include: Australia's National Assessment Program Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN); National Strategy to Improve Literacy and Numeracy among Children and Young People 2011-2020 (Ireland) ; the Learning Support Program (LSP) and Learning Support for Maths (LSM) in Singapore; and the National Literacy and Numeracy Programmes (United Kingdom). Most of these programs involve some sort of screening once or twice annually to monitor students' progress in basic reading, writing and mathematical skills. Oftentimes, data from these screenings are used as cornerstones for school-level remedial reading and numeracy intervention programs. The same methodology is used for the LINUS2.0. Continuing where the KIA2M program left off, the LINUS program was formulated to include the Malay and English Language, as well as numeracy (Tubah & Hamid, 2011) . This program is especially pertinent to Sarawak, in view of its students' low performance in a multitude of public examinations, when ranked with the other Malaysian states (MoE, 2013, p. 3-17) . This problem has impacted the country's needs for the highly-skilled, creative and innovative workforce to drive competitiveness on the 21st-century global economic stage. Furthermore, low-achievement in literacy and numeracy will hamper efforts by the MoE to improve the country's standing in two major international large scale assessments, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA).\n(Rahmah Murshidi, Mohd Majid Konting, Habibah Elias, & Foo Say Fooi, 2006; Aziah Ismail, Loh Hooi Yen, & Abdul Ghani Kanesan Abdullah, 2015; Teh Pei Ling, Zaidatol Akmaliah Lope Pihie, Soaib Asimirin, & Foo Say Fooi, 2015) . Most of these researchers have investigated factors of teacher efficacy within the ambits of school culture, pedagogy and school leadership. However, few studies have looked into teacher efficacy within the context of literacy and numeracy. This study scrutinizes the question: why are school children still failing to grasp the basics of literacy and numeracy by Year 3? Is it because of the teachers' own beliefs with regards to the delivery of the lesson or whether the students learn? To that end, it would be instructive to investigate how teachers' beliefs about teaching and learning (the teacher's sense of efficacy), as it might help offer an explanation for the below-average performance of primary school students in Sarawak and could be used to develop strategies for school improvement."}, {"section_title": "Review of Literature", "text": "The review of literature for this study focuses on the teacher efficacy and its link with, literacy, numeracy and student achievement, as follows:"}, {"section_title": "Teacher Efficacy", "text": "Studies on the teacher's sense of efficacy have yielded findings that point to its influence on student achievement (Morris, Usher, & Chen, 2016) and its role in classroom dynamics and the way classrooms function (Zee & Kooman, 2016) . Further, a plethora of meta-analyses and reviews by educational researchers have made teachers' self-efficacy or beliefs a subject of scrutiny and interest. This surge in interest is accompanied by uplifting reports and findings that valorize the importance of teachers' self-efficacy and its influence on students' behaviour and learning. The bulk of these researchers study the measurement, effects and conceptualization of teachers' self-efficacy (Klassen & Tze 2014; Kleinsasser 2014; Wyatt, 2014; Zee & Kooman, 2016) .\nIn particular, a meta-analysis by Klassen and Tze (2014) found a strong correlation between teachers' self-efficacy and how their colleagues, supervisors and administrators perceive and assess their effectiveness. Equally important is the significant correlations found between teacher efficacy and students' achievement, which is an insight into how teachers' self-efficacy affects students' experiences in the classroom (Klassen & Tze, 2014) . This is consistent with studies about how teachers who report a higher sense of self and collective efficacy tend to exhibit positive behavior (Ross, 1998; Goddard, Hoy, & Woolfolk-Hoy, 2000; Wheatley, 2002; Labone, 2004) . In addition, these studies have also identified teacher efficacy as a significant predictor for teachers' commitment to teaching and competence.\nResearchers have found that teachers with high levels of teacher efficacy are more willing to explore approaches and strategic ideas in the classroom. These same teachers would have students who score higher on literacy achievement tests, specifically, language arts (Goddard, Goddard, Eun & Miller, 2015; Calik, Sezgin, Kavgaci, & Kilinc, 2012) . Teachers scoring highly on teacher efficacy were found to have students who were more interested in schooling and reported better achievement in numeracy (Duyar, Gumus, & Bellibas, 2013) .\nThere is a positive correlation between the rise of self-efficacy beliefs and when teachers witness improvement in student achievements due to the teaching. The raised self-efficacy leads to higher persistence and effort by the teacher. Conversely, repeated failures may result in lower self-efficacy beliefs, demotivation and decreased resilience (Morris, Usher & Chen, 2016) ."}, {"section_title": "Literacy and Numeracy in Malaysia", "text": "The Literacy and Numeracy Screening (LINUS) program aims to ensure the mastery of the Malay Language Literacy (LBM) and Numeracy (NUM) after three years of primary schooling for students in Years 1 to 3, with the exception of students with special needs. In 2013, the Ministry of Education introduced English Language Literacy (LBI) to the list, after which it is better known by the acronym LINUS2.0. A number of studies on the LINUS program have been in recent years. An example includes Ong, Roselan, Anwardeen and Mohd Mustapa's (2015) granular examination of the quality of LBI assessment in Malaysia, in which they concluded LINUS2.0 to be an effective and sufficiently robust program, if executed according to expectations. Another study by Bokhari, Md Rashid and Chan (2016) focused on the teachers' perceptions towards the implementation of LBI at school level. While the study highlighted the obstacles they faced while running the program, most of the teachers perceived its impact on the students' performance positively. Hadzir, Alias, Kamaruzaman and Mohd Yusof (2016) used a semi-structured interview research design and focused on the program's effect on Year 1 students. Nazariyah Sani and Abdul Rahman Idris's (2012) work on Orang Asli students in Hulu Langat, and Tubah and Hamid's (2011) study were qualitative in design while Musliman, Ariffin and Din (2013) used a quantitative design, with a focus on the students' spatial intelligence and their ability to recognize alphabets and numbers.\nA slew of studies on literacy have used multivariate logistic regression (Daraganova, Edwards, & Sipthorp, 2013; Greyling, 2015; Zubrick et al., 2015) . Logistic regression analytic methods are used to isolate the causal effect of literacy and numeracy attainment. These studies observed the result of the often binary (pass/fail) nature of the dependent variable. In addition, some of the studies employed linear regression (Snowling, Hulme, Bailey, Stothard & Lindsay, 2014; Carmichael, MacDonald & McFarland-Piazza, 2014; Lane & Murray, 2015) and mixed effects regression (Purpura, Hume, Sims, & Lonigan, 2011) . This paper will focus on binary logistic regression within the context of teacher efficacy."}, {"section_title": "The Link Between Teacher Efficacy and Student Achievement", "text": "Teachers who report high levels of teacher efficacy show would be more open to try novel or new pedagogy ideas in the classroom. Studies by Tschannen-Moran, Woolfolk-Hoy and Hoy (1998) have borne this out. Furthermore, the studies found that the students of these same teachers score higher on language arts and other literacy tests. High efficacy teachers also have students who show more interest in schooling and score better in numeracy tests. (Tracz & Gibson, 1986; Ross & Cousins,1993) .\nA multitude of educational researchers have reported on the link between the teacher's sense of self-efficacy and student achievement (Allinder, 1995; Ashton & Webb, 1986; Tracz & Gibson, 1986; Ross, 1992 Ross, , 1994 . The researchers advanced the idea that the teacher's behavior is influenced by the level of self-efficacy, which in turn influences the student's academic performance and their behavior. This is relevant to the teaching of literacy, where the range of the students' reading levels are wide (Baumann, Hoffman, Duffy-Hester, & Moon, 2000) .\nStudies have found that teachers with low self-efficacy have a higher tendency to continue with ineffective teaching, in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Further, they tend to lay the blame on students for their failure in following lessons and give up on them earlier. These teachers also have a higher tendency to refer students for special education classes or intervention (Norton, 2017; Podell & Soodak, 1993) . Conversely, a teacher with a high sense of self-efficacy would have a higher tendency to explore different instructional strategies until the students are successful in their learning (Beauchamp, Klassen, Parsons, Durksen & Taylor, 2014) . This is particularly pertinent to literacy instruction, where the range of the students' reading levels are wide (Holzberger, Philip & Kunter, 2014; Baumann, Hoffman, Duffy-Hester, & Moon, 2000) . In such a situation, teachers would have to make complex decisions in order to differentiate the instruction and meet the students' needs. To a certain extent, effective literacy instruction hinges upon the teacher's perceived self-efficacy that the skills needed to deliver the lesson can be performed successfully under stressful and unpredictable situations."}, {"section_title": "Material and Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Research Model", "text": "The data collection method in this study is survey -a method used to make generalizations onto the population (Creswell, 2012)."}, {"section_title": "Data Collection Tools", "text": "This study uses an adapted version of Tschannen-Moran et al's (1998) Teacher Self-Efficacy Survey (TSES).

"}, {"section_title": "Teacher Self-Efficacy Survey (TSES)", "text": "Teacher efficacy is the independent variable in this study, with student achievement for literacy and numeracy the dependent variable. The independent variable is based on the framework for the teacher self-efficacy-the Teacher Self-Efficacy Model -as advanced by Tschannen-Moran, Woolfolk-Hoy, & Hoy, (1998) . Subsumed under the teacher efficacy (TE) framework are dimensions such as efficacy in classroom management, efficacy in instructional strategies and efficacy in student engagement. Using the TSES, this study looks at the extent to which the teacher is a role model to his/her students. The teacher's ability to imbue confidence in the student when resolving problems, for instance, is part of student engagement. Additionally, the ability of the teacher to gauge the student's needs and help to acquire it hews closely to the dimension of instructional strategies (Tschannen Moran, Woolfolk-Hoy & Hoy, 1998).\nTschannen-Moran, Woolfolk Hoy and Hoy (1998) conceived and developed the Teacher Self Efficacy Survey (TSES) to measure the dimensions subsumed within the Teacher Self-Efficacy Model. Initially known as the Ohio State Teacher Efficacy Scale (OSTES), The TSES comes with two forms, referred to as the short form and the long form. The TSES aims to profile teacher perceptions of their current ability, resources and opportunity related to their own classroom behaviour, as per the descriptors. Within each form are 24 items which are intended to measure the three dimensions of teacher's sense of self-efficacy: efficacy of classroom management, the efficacy of instructional strategies and efficacy of student engagement. Each of the dimensions contains 8 items. From previous researches, the full scales have produced reliability scores that range from .92 to .95. Reliability scores for the dimensions have ranged from .86 to .90 (Tschannen-Moran et al., 2001 ).\nThe TSES is chosen because it is a widely-used and validated assessment of the teachers' perceptions of support and satisfaction with their own professional performance. Although the original TSES scale assesses the items on a 9-point continuum, the adapted TSES 5-points Likert scale is used here, ranging from Nothing (1) to A Great Deal (5).

In assessing the influence of teacher efficacy on literacy and numeracy, the independent variablestudent engagement -made a statistically significant contribution to the model. Recording an odds ratio of .49 for NUM, this indicated that for every additional unit increase in teacher efficacy score for student engagement, respondents were .49 times less likely to achieve the national KPI for NUM.\nDirect logistic regression was performed to assess the impact of a number of factors on the likelihood of teacher efficacy subscales influencing student achievement in LBM. The model contained three independent variables (student engagement, instructional strategies and classroom management). The full model containing all predictors was statistically significant, \u03c7 2 (3, N=105) = 10.028, with a p value of .018, indicating that the model was able to distinguish between subscales that influence and did not influence student achievement in LBM.\nThe model as a whole explained between 9.1% (Cox and Snell R squared) and 12.5% (Nagelkerke R squared) of the variance in teacher efficacy, and correctly classified 67.6% of cases. As shown in Table 4 , one of the independent variables made a unique statistically significant contribution to the model. However, teacher efficacy for student engagement in LBM recorded an odds ratio of .014, which was less than 1. This indicated the school is over 71 times more likely to experience a literacy rate of 100% in LBM without student engagement, controlling for other factors in the model. The results for binary logistic regression is summarized in Table 6 . To examine the impact of a number of factors on the likelihood of teacher efficacy subscales influencing student achievement in English literacy (LBI), the model considers 3 independent variables (student engagement, instructional strategies and classroom management). The logistic regression presented the full model containing all predictors as statistically significant, \u03c7 2 (3, N=105) = 10.586, with a p-value of .014, indicating that the model was able to distinguish between subscales that influence and did not influence student achievement in LBI. As a whole, the model explained between 9.6% (Cox and Snell R squared) and 12.9% (Nagelkerke R squared) of the variance in teacher efficacy, and correctly classified 68.6% of cases. Table 7 shows that one of the independent variables made a unique statistically significant contribution to the model. Here, teacher efficacy for student engagement in LBI recorded an odds ratio of .016, which, at less than 1, indicated the school is over 62 times more likely to experience a literacy rate of 100% in LBI without student engagement, controlling for other factors in the model.

"}, {"section_title": "Discussion and Conclusion", "text": "The first key finding of this study is related to teacher self-efficacy. The biggest mean differences were between the responses of those on both extremes of teaching experience: those who have had 30 years of experience and those who have had fewer than 10 years' experience. This finding supports Fives and Buehl's (2010) , findings that teachers with more than 10 years of experience (especially at primary school level) gained greater teaching efficacy than those who were just starting out in teaching. Broadly, findings from Mohd Khairuddin Abdullah & Halimah Laji's (2015) and Soodak and Podel's (1996) studies suggest that with more experience, teachers grow in efficaciousness and confidence in their teaching. This pattern is consistent for all three dimensions of teacher efficacy, as evidenced from the post-hoc Tukey test result outlined in the previous chapter. Other researchers are in agreement with this data (Christenson, Reschly, & Wylie, 2012; Dixon, Yssel, McConnell, & Hardin, 2014; Skinner, Pitzer, & Steele, 2016) .\nOn that note, Zepeda (2016) provided a possible explanation for this phenomenon, by linking teacher efficacy with supervision and evaluation (another strong predictor for student achievement that will be explained later in this chapter). Novice teachers can benefit from a supportive structure in order to make a smoother entrance into what would be a life-long career. These beginning teachers' beliefs or self-efficacy would be shaped in the initial years of their profession -the experiences which would guide them throughout their teaching years. Veteran teachers, with their years of experience, can establish a mentorship grounded on the sharing of the best instructional methodology. The headmaster as the de facto instructional leader can aid this by recognizing that teachers at any part of career timeline can do with some assistance -be it from a credible and qualified veteran or the administrators themselves.\nThe teaching can always be improved. With appropriate supervision and evaluation on teachers by the headmaster, schools can develop teachers professionally, increase their confidence in teaching and in turn, improve student achievement (Zepeda, 2017) . On a related note, Lumpe, Czerniak, Haney and Beltyukova (2012) found that teachers who participated in intense teacher development programs reported gains in their teaching self-efficacy beliefs.\nTeachers with more years of teaching experience under their belts could have enjoyed more professional development contact hours which contribute to their own high sense of teaching self-efficacy. Overall, effectiveness in student engagement, effectiveness in instructional strategies and effectiveness in classroom management-all recorded high levels of self-efficacy. This indicates that teachers in primary schools reported high levels of self-efficacy. This is supported by data from Kuching and Samarahan (Teng, 2006) and in congruence with researches on teacher self-efficacy done elsewhere in Malaysia by Khalid (2009 ), Ebmeier (2003 and Demir (2008) .\nThe second key finding of this study is the statistical significance of the variable student engagement, a subscale of the variable teacher efficacy for LBM and LBI. Here, the result of logistic regression suggested that the practice of teacher efficacy in student engagement was 71 times less likely to achieve 100% literacy rate for LBM and 62.5 times less likely to achieve 100% literacy rate for LBI. In other words, teacher efficacy in student engagement was found to have a negative relationship with LBM and LBI. The finding of the present study is congruent with those from several related studies (Moalosi, 2012; Weiss & Garcia, 2014; Rodriguez, Regueiro, Blas, Valle, Pineiro, & Cerezo, 2014 , Lee, 2014 . Weiss and Garcia's (2014) study in Mexico concluded that improvement of student achievement is not contingent upon stronger engagement, while entertaining the possibility of a negative correlation with academic outcome.\nThe same study reported that engagement with teachers did not translate into improved assessment scores. In fact, students who reported a higher feeling of connectedness with teachers scored lower in tests. By way of explanation, Weiss and Garcia (2014) questioned the cross-cultural applicability of the dimensions of engagement, especially on the operationalization of constructs. They suggested taking into account the teachers' qualifications, like level of education and years of experience with the current subject). On a related note, Rodriguez, Regueiro, Blas, Valle, Pineiro, & Cerezo (2014) observed how students of overconfident teachers with a high perception of self-efficacy seemed to be less engaged compared to students of teachers with a moderate perception of self-efficacy, who demonstrated relatively lower work avoidance and less anxiety. This ties in with Lee's (2014) study among 3268 American students, where she cautioned of the small effects found in researches vaunting student engagement.\nFuture researches can include variables like family background and the individual when interpreting positive student engagement-academic outcome researches (Lee, 2014) . Many studies have reported of other relevant factors influencing student engagement and academic achievement (Skinner & Pitzer, 2012; Wang & Eccles, 2013) . Perhaps more can be explained by investigating the joint effects of factors like parental educational involvement, educational aspirations and the environmental factor of schools are considered. Further research is warranted to ascertain reasons that could contribute towards this finding.\nHowever, many researchers have also reported contrarian views in the body of literature vis-\u00e0-vis student engagement and teacher efficacy (Reyes, Bracket, Rivers, White, & Salovey, 2012; Christenson, Reschly, & Wylie, 2012; Reeve, 2013; Upadyaya & Salmela-Aro, 2013) . It also runs counter to previous studies, where teachers were found to be most efficacious in relation to classroom management and least efficacious with activities related to student engagement (Fives & Buehl, 2010 ).\nThis finding is shows that not all the subjects were influenced by the same predictor variables. Using this finding as a guide, school heads can place a sizeable emphasis on establishing a community of practice, with experienced teachers as mentors or teacher leaders. These teachers are more confident and more willing to go above and beyond routine classroom duties, as per the finding of this study. Future research can be conducted to investigate how efficaciousness can be imbued and inculcated amongst younger in-service teachers who are just starting out in their career."}]
