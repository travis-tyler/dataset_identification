This increase in production was largely the result of two pieces of legislation that mandated the nation's supply of transportation fuel contain specified quantities of renewable fuels (i.e. biofuels). Specifically, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 established the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which included a schedule of required biofuel use that started at 4 billion gallons in 2006 and rose to 7.5 billion gallons by 2012. Two years later, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 replaced the RFS with the Revised Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2). The RFS2 included a new schedule of required biofuel use that began at 9 billion gallons in 2008 and ramped up to 36 billion gallons in 2022. Corn ethanol's mandate started at 9 billion gallons in 2008, gradually increased to 15 billion gallons in 2015, and was held constant at that level through 2022. With the exception of ethanol produced in certain grandfathered refineries, a biofuel must have a lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) profile at least 20 percent lower than that of the fossil fuel it replaces to qualify as a renewable fuel under the RFS2. Earlier studies by  and Fargione et al. (2008) examined the effects of allocating billions of bushels of corn to ethanol production on supplies of corn and other commodities going to domestic and world food and feed markets. 2 These studies proposed that domestic and world commodity prices would rise and farmers in the United States and other regions would respond by bringing new lands into production. Bringing new land into commodity production results typically in CO 2 emissions and these emissions can be large if the former land use was native grassland, wetland, or forest. The domestic and international land effects described above are referred to as, respectively, \"direct land-use change\" and \"indirect land-use change\" (iLUC). GHG profiles of corn ethanol date back to the early 1990s, but those done prior to 2007 did not account for emissions related to iLUC.  and Fargione et al. (2008) concluded that when emissions related to iLUC are accounted for, corn ethanol has a higher GHG profile than gasoline. More recently, researchers have reviewed the responses of farmers across the world to changes in corn demand. This study draws on these new findings, including Bruce Babcock and Zabid Iqbal's publication \"Using Recent Land Use Changes to Validate Land Use Change Models\". Babcock and Iqbal's study confirmed that the primary land-use change response by the world's farmers during the period 2004-2012 was to use available land resources more efficiently rather than expanding land brought into production (Babcock and Iqbal, 2014). Farmers in Brazil, India, and China have increased double cropping, reduced unharvested planted area, reduced fallow land, and reduced temporary pasture in order to expand production. The RFS2 directed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to do a full life-cycle analysis (LCA) of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the production of corn ethanol (as well as other biofuels) and explicitly specified that emissions related to iLUC be included. In 2010, EPA released this LCA as part of its Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) of the RFS2. The EPA RIA developed projections through 2022 of the GHG emissions associated with 11 specific emission categories that, conceptually, capture the full range of direct and indirect GHG emissions associated with corn-ethanol production and combustion (i.e., from corn field to tailpipe). These emission categories include: 1. Domestic farm inputs and fertilizer N 2 O 2. Domestic land-use change 3. Domestic rice methane 3 4. Domestic livestock 4 5. International land-use change 6. International farm inputs and fertilizer N 2 O 7. International rice methane 8. International livestock 9. Fuel and feedstock transport 10. Fuel production 11. Tailpipe Figure 1-1 presents these emission categories and the data sources and models that EPA used to estimate their GHG emissions. EPA evaluated the emissions and energy use associated with each emission category and the upstream components. 3 Domestic rice methane is included to account for changes in land-use emissions based on the increased demand for biofuels and change in domestic rice acreage. 4 Domestic livestock is included to account for the change in livestock production as costs for feed changes due to corn ethanol production."}, {"section_title": "ICF", "text": "3 January 12, 2017 Source: EPA, 2010a. Based on the EPA RIA, EPA concluded that in 2022, the GHG emissions associated with production of a unit of corn-based ethanol from a state-of-the-art natural gas powered refinery would be about 21 percent lower than the emissions from an energy equivalent quantity of an \"average\" gasoline in 2005. 5 Figure 1-2 shows the EPA RIA emissions profiles for corn ethanol and the average gallon of gasoline."}, {"section_title": "ICF 4 January 12, 2017", "text": "Source: EPA, 2010a. Figure 1-2 shows that for corn ethanol-dry mill-natural gas plants-the largest sources of emissions were international land-use change, fuel production, and domestic farm inputs and fertilizer N 2 O. The figure shows the 95 percent confidence interval from the study's uncertainty assessment for the corn ethanol scenario. The largest source of emissions within international land-use change are the conversion of land from pasture to cropland and the land-use change that were projected to occur in Brazil's Amazon region. These international land-use change contributions are important areas of focus for the updates conducted as part of this study. However, as discussed later other non-land use contributions are also important. The EPA RIA is one of the most comprehensive modeling frameworks yet developed for projecting how the GHG profile of corn-based ethanol might change in response to anticipated changes in market conditions and/or renewable energy policies. Much of the EPA RIA analysis still reflects our best understanding of the relationships between some emission categories, the key emissions drivers within them, and corn ethanol's GHG profile. At the same time, a large body of new information has become available since 2010-including new data, scientific studies, industry trends, technical reports, and updated emissions coefficients-that indicates that for many of the emission categories in the EPA RIA, the actual emissions pathways that have developed since 2010 differ significantly from those projected in the EPA RIA. The primary purpose of this report is to consider a more complete set of information now available related to the life-cycle emissions for corn-based ethanol and based on this information, assess its current (i.e., in 2014) GHG emissions profile. This report also develops two projected emissions profiles for corn ethanol in 2022 (the last year of the RFS2). Starting with the current emissions profile, the first projection, labeled the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, assumes that recent trends observed in corn inputs and per-acre yields, refinery technologies, vehicle fleets, and other factors continue through 2022. The continuation of these trends has implications for the path that GHG emissions attributable to corn ethanol production will follow over the next few years. The second projection, labeled the Building-Blocks scenario, adds to the BAU the assumption that refineries adopt a set of currently available GHG reducing technologies and practices in corn production, transportation, and co-products. The Building-Blocks scenario can be viewed as a best-case assessment of corn ethanol's potential to mitigate GHG emissions given currently available technologies and production practices."}, {"section_title": "General Approach", "text": "Since 2010, the EPA RIA's estimated GHG mitigation value for corn ethanol, 21 percent lower emissions than an energy equivalent quantity of gasoline, has dominated academic, industry, and policy discussions of GHG issues related to renewable transportation fuels, as well as the design of federal renewable fuels policy (specifically, the RFS2). For these reasons, the structure the LCA developed in this report is designed so that comparisons of its results with those in the EPA RIA are relatively straightforward. For example, to match boundary conditions and emissions coverage, this study employs the same 11 emission categories that make up the EPA RIA. Due to the EPA RIA's comprehensive coverage of GHG emissions, both in aggregate and within each category, it is generally straightforward to assess where new information indicates that current emissions differ from the paths projected in 2010, as well as what the magnitudes and directions of the differences are. Another structural similarity that facilitates comparisons between the LCA developed here and that in the RIA is a focus on the increase in corn ethanol production attributable to the RFS2 in assessing corn ethanol's GHG profile. This results in an emphasis on the relationships that currently exist between the 11 emission categories, the key GHG drivers within them, and ethanol's GHG profile. Based on a 2007 projection of ethanol production (i.e., before the RFS2) done by the Department of Energy's Energy Information Agency (EIA) without an RFS in place and the 15 billion gallon cap on corn ethanol in the RFS2, EPA projected that the RFS2 would increase corn ethanol production by 3.03 billion gallons in 2014 and 2.6 billion gallons in 2022 over the baseline EIA projection. 6 We used the 3.03 billion gallon increase in ethanol production to assess the contribution of most of the emission categories in the current GHG profile and the 2.6 billion gallon increase in the two projected profiles for 2022. The only exception was the land-use change emission categories. Modeling of indirect land-use change (where the United States land-use change results were used for the domestic land-use impact) in the RIA and the results utilized in this study are based on the changes in land use to successfully meet the requirements of the RFS (15 billion gallons) with 2004 as the baseline year (when ethanol production was 3.4 billion gallons). The emission impacts in these two categories are quantified based on an ethanol production increase of 11.59 billion gallons (i.e., 15 billion gallons minus 11.59 billion gallons). Table 1-1 shows the values specific to the 2022 assumptions for corn ethanol.  b The Control Scenario represents the projected corn ethanol volume that might be used to comply with the EISA volume mandate. The RIA notes that although actual volumes and feedstocks will likely be different, EPA believes that the projections made are within the range of expected outcomes when the standards are met, and allow for an assessment of the potential impacts of the RFS2 rule. c The Difference represents the volume difference between the business-as-usual projections and the anticipated volumes to comply with EISA. While the analysis developed in this report draws extensively from the EPA RIA from 2010, it does not replicate the methodology developed by EPA at that time to evaluate lifecycle GHG emissions associated with corn ethanol for implementation of the Renewable Fuels Standard. As such, the results presented in this report are not directly comparable to the results included in EPA's RIA, nor does it alter the implementation of the RFS program. Here, ICF has considered the EPA RIA, observed industry trends since the implementation of the Renewable Fuels Standard, new research on lifecycle assessments, new data and other information that has become available since 2010-to reflect what has occurred (see Chapter 2). New information accounted for in this assessment includes new values that have been developed since 2010 for many of the GHG emissions coefficients and conversion factors used in the RIA. These coefficients and factors are used to assign GHG emissions values to specific changes in economic activity, input use, land management practices, and output levels. In general, updated values for specific emissions coefficients and factors are discussed in the sections where they are applicable. One set of updated conversion factors, however, applies across emission categories and is discussed below. Since 1990, researchers and policy analysts have generally converted emissions of all GHGs to equivalent units of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) using the Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) endorsed at the time by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). These GWPs are reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and are updated in each IPCC Assessment Report (AR). In 2010, the UNFCCC required Parties to use the GWPs from the IPCC's Second Assessment Report (SAR); today, the UNFCCC requires Parties to use the GWPs contained in the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). 8 Both sets of GWPs are shown in Table 1-2. Simply due to the changes in the GWPs shown in Table 1-2, emissions of methane (CH 4 ) will receive more weight in this report than in the EPA RIA and emissions of N 2 O will receive less. Finally, throughout this report a large number of metrics are used to quantify the emissions associated with different activity levels, production processes, use of inputs, and outputs levels. Within a given source category, the set of metric(s) presented generally reflect those commonly used in the related literature. For example, emissions related to the use of nitrogen and other chemicals in corn production are summarized in kilograms (kg) CO 2 e/acre, kg CO 2 e/bushel, and kg CO 2 e per gallon of ethanol (see Table 3-7). For purposes of adding emissions across source categories in this analysis, and for facilitating comparisons with various emissions levels reported in the RIA, emissions for all source categories are also presented in grams CO 2 e/million Btu (g CO 2 e/MMBtu)."}, {"section_title": "Organization of the Report", "text": "In the report that follows, Chapter 2 reviews the scientific papers, technical reports, data sets, and other information that has become available since 2010 and relate to current emission levels in each emission category. Chapter 3 develops current GHG emission values for each emission category included in the EPA RIA based on the literature review. Chapter 3 considers each emission category separately. For each emission category, the section includes a summary of the methods, data sources, and emissions projection developed in the EPA RIA, describes the methods ICF used to quantify the contribution to corn ethanol's current GHG profile attributable to that category, and quantifies that contribution. Based on the current GHG emissions profile of corn ethanol developed in Chapter 3, Chapter 4 develops two projected profiles for corn ethanol in 2022. The first projection considers a continuation through 2022 of observable trends in corn yields (per acre), process fuel switching toward natural gas, and fuel efficiency in trucking. The second projection adds a number of changes refineries could make in their value chain to further reduce the GHG intensity of corn ethanol. These changes include contracting with farmers to reduce tillage and manage nitrogen applications, switch to biomass as a process fuel, and locating confined livestock operations in close proximity to refineries."}, {"section_title": "Review of the Scientific Papers, Technical Reports, Data Sets, and Other Information that have Become Available Since 2010 and Relate to Current Emissions Levels in Each Emissions Category", "text": "This chapter reviews and synthesizes the scientific papers, technical reports, data sets, and other information in the peer-reviewed and credible non-peer-reviewed literature that have become available since 2010 and relate to current emissions levels in the 11 source categories included in EPA's Renewable Fuel Standard Program (RFS2) Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA).

The fertilizers evaluated included nitrogen, phosphorous, potash, and lime. Representative herbicides and pesticides were also included. On-site fuels included diesel, gasoline, natural gas, and electricity. N 2 O emissions due to application of synthetic fertilizers were also quantified. 9 Many of the inputs for the existing EPA emission estimates come from established data sources (e.g., the emission factors included in GREET) and other model outputs (e.g., FASOM, FAPRI, MOVES). We reviewed updated output datasets including emission factors from more recent versions of these models. For example, Argonne National Laboratory's GREET and Carbon Calculator for Land Use Change from Biofuels Production (CCLUB) models were updated in 2015, so ICF was able to readily compare any updated emission factors against those used for the RIA. The RIA uses estimates of domestic agricultural inputs for fertilizer, pesticides, and energy use from the Forestry and Agriculture Sector Optimization Model (FASOM) output. Since the release of the RFS2 RIA, additional empirical data are available to validate and/or update those inputs used in the analysis. For example, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) reports much of these data under the Agricultural Chemical Use Program.\nThe domestic farm inputs evaluated in the EPA RIA include fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, and on-site fuel use.

Rates and amounts applied are published in the acid or metallic equivalent, as applicable. Selected items available for all commodity programs.\nAnnual Growth emission factors are based on the percentage of area in each ecosystem that is converted to biofuel feedstock production, and an estimated carbon sequestration value for each Ecosystem Subclass. Five (5) of the ecosystem subclasses would sequester carbon when mature. Computed final emission factor uses an assumption of 30 years for feedstock production (Foregone C-Sequestration Period). Similar to Winrock, these emission factors have been estimated using CCLUB to represent emission during a 30-year duration of biofuels production.  \nLand Clearing with Fire: Fire for land clearing is assumed to occur in all countries included in the analysis except China and Argentina. These estimates are based on the area burnt, the mass of fuel used for combustion and the emission factor for dry matter .\n\nLand Reversion Carbon Uptake Factors: All reversion factors (except reversion to forest) were estimated as the reverse of emission factors, and all increases in biomass stocks occurred in Year 1. Forest reversion factors are based on the assumption that biomass accumulates every year over the entire 30-year time period. \uf06e Change in Pasture Land Conversion: The analysis accounted for changes in pasture area resulting from livestock fluctuations in order to create a link between the livestock and land used for grazing. The regional pasture stocking rates determine the amount of land needed for pasture. Any unneeded pasture areas are available for cropland or to be returned to their natural state. In countries where the livestock rates increased, the land used for pasture can be added to the abandoned cropland, unused grassland, or result in deforestation. The average stocking rates for each of the 54 FAPRI-CARD regions were determined based on data on livestock populations from the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) (see Table 2.4-31 from EPA RIA) (EPA, 2010a). Outliers such as countries within the \"CIS, Other\" FAPRI-CARD region, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, were removed. Countries with unusually low regional stocking rates were adjusted. \uf06e Agricultural Land-Use Change GHG Emission Factors: Winrock International produced emission factors based on IPCC guidelines to calculate the GHG emissions associated with the projected land conversions. The international land-use change GHG impacts were annualized over 30 years with a 0 percent discount rate. Accounting for pasture areas was essential as internationally more land is used for livestock production than crop production. As a result, the representation of Brazil within FAPRI-CARD explicitly accounts for changes in pasture area.\nInfrastructure retrofits, such as utilizing existing liquid fuel pipelines for ethanol transport (Strogen et al., 2013). \uf06e Decreasing GHG intensity of the average fuel mix used in transportation (Cai et al., 2015). Given these potential sources of GHG reductions, our assessment applied the latest data and emission factors using a similar methodology to the EPA's report.  EPA used a combination of sources to determine fuel and feedstock transportation emissions. The GREET 2009 model was utilized by EPA to calculate final GHG emissions (Argonne, 2009) for the modes and distances. For feedstock transportation, the study used the standard GREET inputs of mode and distance for farm to stacks (truck, 40 miles), and stack to plant (truck, 30 miles). EPA used an Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) study to estimate the projected (2022) fuel transportation modes and distances from the ethanol plant to the bulk terminal (Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 2009). These modes and distances were applied to GREET to determine GHG emissions. For co-products, the EPA study used USDA mode and distance estimates for DGS transportation, and did not include any transportation requirements for corn oil. Our methodology used the more recent 2015 GREET model, which includes the recent expansion in freight vehicle LCA emission factors (Cai et al., 2015) as detailed in Section 2.8 of the literature review. Our analysis also uses the current GREET standard inputs for fuel and feedstock modes, distances, and emissions factors. The analysis models corn oil transportation by extracting GREET's per mass GHG emission factor for transportation of the co-product. DGS transport is modeled using the EPA's mode and distance assumptions with emission factors from Nealer et al. (2012). Table 3-59 show the assumptions in mode and distance for transportation used in our analysis. Both the EPA and our study assumed no ethanol is currently being transported through pipelines.  Figure 3-6 shows the results for fuel and feedstock transportation, separated by transportation phase and co-product. The RIA total is also included for comparison. The final DGS transportation result is a weighted average of dry and wet DGS based on the expected yields shown in Table 3-64 for the industry average modeled in fuel production.  3.9.5. Limitations, Uncertainty, and Knowledge Gaps Figure 3-6 shows similar results between the EPA RIA and our analysis. This similarity is due to the use of similar emission factors in GREET, as there has not been substantial implementation of the potential transportation decarbonization efforts that are outlined at the beginning of this section. A more complete assessment could collect supply-chain data from farms and corn ethanol plants to gain a better representation of the exact modes and transportation distances being used. This dataset could be compared to the assumptions used by EPA, GREET, and our analysis to fully determine if these estimates are accurate. However, major efforts to improve the accuracy of fuel and feedstock transportation emissions will likely only have a small effect on the total corn ethanol life-cycle emissions result, since as stated previously, fuel and feedstock transportation contributes relatively little to the total cor ethanol life-cycle GHG emissions."}, {"section_title": "Domestic Farm Energy Use", "text": "Periodically, USDA produces an updated inventory of GHG emissions and carbon storage for the agriculture and forestry sectors. These reports are consistent with the annual emissions reporting done by EPA, but provide an enhanced view of the data regionally and by land use. "}, {"section_title": "Domestic Farm Nitrogen Application", "text": "As indicated in the recent literature (see Table 2-1), N application has increased from 137 to 143 pounds per acre from 2005 to 2010. However, yield per acre has increased during the same period, thereby resulting in a net decrease in N application per crop yield. In particular, as The Fertilizer Institute states: Between 1980 and 2014, U.S. farmers more than doubled corn production using only slightly more fertilizer nutrients than were used in 1980. This analysis is based on fertilizer application rate and corn production and acreage data reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). Specifically, in 1980, farmers grew 6.64 billion bushels of corn using 3.2 pounds of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) for each bushel and in 2014 they grew 14.22 billion bushels using less than 1.6 pounds of nutrients per bushel produced. In total, this represents an 114 percent increase in production using only 4.5 percent more nutrients during that same timeframe. Between 2010 and 2014 there was a slight decrease in fertilizer per bushel (i.e., from 1.63 to 1.56 pounds of N per bushel) (The Fertilizer Institute, 2016). This decrease in fertilizer application, combined with the direct change in acres, could reduce the impact of domestic nitrogen application. "}, {"section_title": "Domestic Farm Inputs and Fertilizer N 2 O Emission Factors", "text": "The RIA used Argonne National Laboratory's GREET_1.8c, released in 2009, to create emission factors for herbicides, pesticides, and nitrogen, phosphate, potash, and lime fertilizers. The GREET emission factors were documented in two locations within the docket. Based on the file, \"Renewable Fuel Lifecycle Greenhouse Gas Calculations (2).xls\" (Docket ID: EPA-HQ-OAR-2005-0161-0950) (EPA, 2009a) the emission factors are presented below in Table 2  Based on the docket file, \"GREET_Model_Spreadsheets_Used_in_the_Lifecycle_Analysis_(3).xls\" (Docket ID: EPA-HQ-OAR-2005-0161-3176) (EPA, 2009a), the values were taken from GREET and multiplied by 1.1. The RIA does not include any explanation for the multiplication. One possible reasoning is that the 1.1 multiplicative is to adjust the GREET lower heating value (LHV) to align with EIA's higher heating value (HHV). Table 2-3 below shows the GREET data used in the RIA that includes the raw GREET emission factors multiplied by 1.1 found in the docket spreadsheet. Since the RIA was released, GREET has been updated nine times. Common updates include the addition of new pathways, updated natural gas and oil data, and updated electricity generation mix. During the GREET 2014 update, ethanol production from corn, soy, and cellulose were updated and expanded. The most recent release of GREET was October 2, 2015. Table 2-4 below shows the updated emission factors for herbicides, pesticides, and nitrogen, phosphate, potash, and lime fertilizers included in GREET 2015. With IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) applied, a comparison of each set of emission factors (in g CO 2 e/ton of nutrient) are presented below in Figure 2-1. The updated 2015 data shows an increase in the GHG impact of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers but a decrease in the GHG impact of potash and lime fertilizers.  As the tables show, there are significant differences in emissions and energy use between GREET1_2009 and GREET1_2015 for nitrogen fertilizer and lime. For nitrogen fertilizer, between 2009 and 2015, Argonne adjusted energy use for nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing by increasing natural gas use across all nitrogen fertilizer types. For lime, energy use and emissions are significantly reduced from GREET_2009 to GREET_2015. The changes result from Argonne's correction of using crushed limestone in GREET_2015 from using lime in GREET_2009."}, {"section_title": "Domestic Farm Input and Fertilizer N 2 O Management Practices", "text": "While the RIA includes comprehensive information on emission factors, it does not include the recent literature discussing an increase in crop and nutrient management strategies. These strategies have the potential to reduce the emissions from agriculture production, which could have a noticeable impact on domestic farm input and fertilizer N 2 O emission calculations such as for the corn ethanol LCA. Two of the most common of these strategies are use of nitrification inhibitors and precision agriculture. USDA statistics already reflect the effects of precision agriculture through the reduced fertilizer use per bushel of corn harvest, however use of nitrification inhibitors is not reflected in estimation of N 2 O emissions. Nitrification inhibitors work by slowing the nitrification process when nitrogen-based fertilizer is applied to crops, which allows for an increase in nitrogen use efficiency. Inhibitors can be mixed into fertilizers or applied separately, and they give crops access to a larger percentage of applied fertilizer. This increased access to applied nitrogen improves the nitrogen use and reduces the nitrogen loss from crops, which decreases the resulting emissions from applied nitrogen-based fertilizers. More specifically, as Trenkel (2010) explains in his comprehensive paper on enhancing nutrient use efficiency in agriculture through slow-and controlled-release and stabilized fertilizers, the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials (AAPFCO) defines a nitrification inhibitor as \"a substance that inhibits the biological oxidation of ammoniacal-N to nitrate-N\" (Trenkel, 2010). Maintaining the nitrogen in its ammonium form longer gives crops a more prolonged chance for nitrogen-uptake, therefore using the applied nitrogen more effectively and reducing emissions through nitrogen loss. Precision agriculture refers to crop strategies that use field-specific data to optimize outputs. As Schimmelpfennig and Ebel (2011) describe in their paper on the recent adoption of precision agriculture, the term precision agriculture is used to designate crop practices that use \"information gathered during field operations, from planting to harvest, to calibrate the application of inputs and economize on fuel use.\" These practices include GPS-and sensor-based mapping systems that regulate the application rate of inputs such as fertilizers and eliminate the potential for overlapping application on corners and irregular fields. Systems that regulate and optimize the application rate are typically called variable rate technology (VRT) or variable rate application (VRA), while systems that reduce or eliminate overlap in application are typically called swath control. Studies released since the implementation of RFS2 show that use of inhibitors on crops can reduce emissions around 20 to 60 percent, depending on factors such as timing of application and soil moisture (Halvorson, 2014;Thapa et al., 2015). In a slightly more modest range, recent literature indicates that variable rate technology can decrease emissions in the range of 19 to 35 percent (Vazquez-Amabile et al., 2013). Although there is no individual agreed-upon emissions reductions rate across the literature, there is a consensus in the literature that these practices can reduce overall emissions in tangible ways, such as by improving the efficiency of nitrogen use, reducing the use of inputs such as nitrogen-based fertilizer, and decreasing on-farm fuel use. Schimmelpfennig and Ebel (2011) describe an upward trend in use of precision agriculture, using data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) of the USDA Economic Research Service (USDA ERS, 2013b). According to the USDA ARMS data, use of many nitrogen management strategies did increase from 2005 to 2010. As the RIA does not include up-to-date data from 2010, it would not have included changes in emissions data caused by these increasingly common practices.  These practices are clearly increasing in use domestically, and given their positive reviews in the recent literature, they are likely to continue to increase. Practices such as use of nitrification inhibitors and precision agriculture could decrease both upstream and downstream emissions from agriculture and will play an important mitigation role in the sector. ICF recognizes that more recent data may be available including a report by the University of Nebraska (Castle et al. 2015). The USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service corn production forecast has two components-acres to be harvested and expected yield per acre. Every year a single survey is performed in June. The producers are asked to report the acreage, by crop, that has either being planted or that they intend to plant, and the acreage they expect to harvest as grain. Data from this survey are used to estimate, among other things, total acres planted to corn\u2026regardless of the intended uses. Preliminary projections of acres to be harvested for grain are also made using these data. (USDA NASS, 1999) This information allows for the determination of historical average national corn yield, percentage of U.S. corn production allocated to ethanol, and differences between corn planted acreage and corn harvested acreage. Table 2-5 summarizes the data.    USDA commodity market year annual information indicates that a high percentage of corn production has been allocated to ethanol during 2010 to 2012 (e.g., 43 percent in 2012 compared with the RIA assumed 41 percent in 2022). A potential reason for the high allocation value in those years is the low crop yields and an initial over production of corn fuel ethanol compared to the assumed values in the control case of the RIA.  (Table 2-5 and Table 2-6). Table 2-7 shows some discrepancies and/or non-harmonization among the production forecast parameters assumed for the RIA among sources. For the purposes of our analysis, FASOM results for 2022 are evaluated. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) published the trend on monthly total ethanol fuel production and consumption from 1981 to 2014 (EIA, 2015). Using this information, in terms of corn market years, the actual and most recent forecast for ethanol conversion can be estimated as illustrated in Table 2-8. According to these data, since 2007 the average ethanol yield is 2.76 gallons/bushel. Moving forward a similar average yield could be expected. It means that the production of 15 billion gallons of corn ethanol would require around 5,435 million bushels of corn. The preliminary data for 2014 indicate that recently the yield could have improved for ethanol production (2.81 gallons/bushel or a 1.8 percent improvement over the average yield). These data indicate that actual national average ethanol conversion yield is slightly higher than the average national yield assumed in the FASOM model runs. FASOM assumes a potential contribution to ethanol production of dry mill versus wet mill ethanol facilities of 91 percent and 9 percent, respectively, with ethanol yields of 2.71 gallons/bushel and 2.50 gallons/bushel for dry mill and well mill processes, respectively (Beach and McCarl, 2010). As a result, FASOM GHG emissions estimates uses a weighted ethanol conversion factor of 2.69 gallons/bushel for the control case in both 2017 and 2022 (EPA, 2010d). Based on FASOM documentation, if the industry average conversion of 2.76 gallons/bushel is achieved in 2017 and 2022, it could be expected that the number of bushels (and domestic land-use all else equal) to be 2.5 percent lower compared to the estimated values in FASOM for the RIA analysis. Table 2-9 shows that U.S. corn ethanol production aligns with expected production under the RIA. In the last four years, an average annual 6 percent net overproduction occurred when compared to the control case due to major production volume in the early days (2010-2011) of the RFS2. On the other hand, assumed land-use impacts may be slightly affected by corn crop yield.

Table 2-11 compares grassland LUC emission factors. In a similar manner to the forestry emission factors, one methodology does not consistently overestimate or underestimate emission factors compared to the other alternatives. Deviations are specific to each country/region. However, in the case of domestic emissions due to grassland LUC, the Winrock emission factor provides the lower emission estimates per unit of area. In the case of international emissions using LUCs estimates by GTAP included in the FAPRI model, the highest GHG emissions estimates in grassland land-use change would result from the use of Woods Hole and ARB AEZ model emission factors. Winrock emission estimates would be 79 percent lower than those obtained in the use of Woods Hole or ARB LCFS AEZ emission factors.   Notice that the variability in emission factors for a specific region highlights the significant impact that economic modeling has on LUC emission estimates.

The RFS2 RIA FASOM has higher projections for future harvested rice acres than the current USDA Projections (USDA OCE, 2016). For example, both the Control Case and the Reference Case have higher predicted harvested acres of rice in 2012 (3.8 million acres for the Reference Case and 3.35 million acres for the Control Case) than were actually harvested in eight of the last nine years with 2010 as the only exception (USDA 2015). Use of the RFS2 RIA emission factors for rice would under-estimate methane production from rice cultivation in most regions between 1990 and 2013 when compared to effective emission factors from the EPA Inventory (EPA, 2015). For example, the RFS2 RIA emission factor for the south central region (where approximately70 percent of all rice production occurs) is 2,249.20 kg CO 2 e/acre compared to the effective Inventory emission factor which ranges from approximately 2,800 to 3,100 kg CO 2 e/acre between 1990-2013. \nThe methane emissions associated with domestic rice production were included in the EPA RIA analysis.

Comparison of the two maps indicates that there is no overlap between major corn and rice crop areas, with the exception of one county in northern Louisiana and one county in southern Missouri. There is some overlap between a major crop area of one crop and a minor crop area of the other crop (i.e. a major crop area for corn and a minor crop area for rice or vice versa) and some overlap of minor areas of both crops. Overall the data indicate that expansion of corn would likely not result in displacement of rice given that the majority of corn is grown in different states (i.e., Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, Minnesota, Indiana) than where the majority of rice is grown (i.e., Arkansas, California, Louisiana, Mississippi). In addition, the two states that have counties with overlapping major production areas (Louisiana and Missouri) are both minor corn producing states (Missouri contributes 3 percent of national corn production and Louisiana contributes less than 1 percent).

The model then calculated regional methane emissions from rice (EPA, 2010b). The RFS2 RIA did not differentiate between primary and ratoon rice crops (the second rice crop grown in a season) and assumed that the reduction of rice acreage was the only method to reduce emissions related to rice cultivation. methane emissions from rice were based on the revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines 14 using separate national emission factors for primary and ratoon rice crops. After the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2012(EPA, 2014, subsequent inventories (EPA, 2015, EPA, 2016) updated the rice emission factors for specific regions. Table 2-22 presents the two sets of emission factors using the same regional break down as the RFS2 RIA used. As described above, the inventory and the RFS2 RIA emission factors are not directly comparable as they use different formulas to determine rice emissions. However, it is possible to derive and compare the effective emission factors from the two studies. To derive the effective emission factor from the Inventory data we: 1. Put each rice producing state into the corresponding RFS2 RIA region category 2. Added up total emissions in that RFS2 RIA region annually from 1990-2013 3. Added up total area harvested in each region (including both primary and ratoon acres) 4. Divided each regional emission by the regional harvested area 5. Converted the effective emission factor to the same units as those used in the RFS2 RIA (i.e., kg CO 2 e/acre) Additionally we derived a national effective emission factor for the entire United States. A comparison of the effective inventory emission factors from 1990-2013 and RFS2 RIA emission factors is shown in  The comparison of emission factors shows that the in general, the RFS2 RIA emission factors are lower than the effective emission factors for the inventory. Specifically the RFS2 RIA emission factors for the South Central, Pacific Southwest, and Corn Belt regions are lower than the effective inventory emission factors from 1990-2013. In contrast, the RFS2 RIA Southwest emission factor is higher than that of the inventory effective emission factor except for in 2009 and 2011-2013, where it is lower. Interestingly, the RFS2 RIA does not include emission factors for the Southeast region despite the fact that rice is grown there (albeit at very low levels). The majority of U.S. rice is grown in the South Central (an average of about 67 percent between 2006-2010) and the Pacific Southwest regions (an average of about 21 percent between 2006-2010). A smaller amount is grown in the Southwest region (an average of 6 percent between 2006-2010).

Internationally we summarize the literature related to emissions associated with livestock production systems in various regions with whom the United States has significant agricultural and energy trade. Impacts internationally are projected to vary by livestock and ethanol feedstock (corn, soy, sugarcane, and switchgrass). Livestock production systems include practices that involve raising livestock for meat, eggs, dairy, and other products such as leather, fur, and wool. Farmers and other facility operators raise animals in either confined, semi-confined, or unconfined spaces. Literature incorporated into this review is mostly limited to considering variables related to corn ethanol production, such as changes in livestock production that affect the cultivation and use of corn, including use of corn-based feed (including distillers grains), land-use demands for domestic livestock production (range, feedlots, pasture), trends in typical animal mass (TAM), total population, and the amount of meat and dairy from each animal. The international livestock sector is characterized by a dichotomy between developing and developed countries. Much of the growth in total meat production between 1980 and 2002 was concentrated in countries with rapid economic growth. In developed countries, production and consumption of livestock products are growing slowly or not at all. Livestock production in industrialized countries accounts for 53 percent of agricultural GDP (Thornton, 2010). Particularly of interest are the practices in South America. The continent's livestock industry (especially swine and cattle production) is concentrated in Brazil and is characterized by landless monogastric production systems (LLM) and Grassland-based livestock production systems (Roman et al., 2006)."}, {"section_title": "Livestock Emission Sources", "text": "Although there are emissions associated with livestock production that are not directly emitted from livestock and their waste (such as due to transportation, animal feed production, or dairy/meat processing), this literature review focuses on the two primary sources of emissions from livestock included in the RFS2 RIA: enteric fermentation and manure management. Enteric fermentation produces methane (\"enteric CH 4 \") and manure management practices result in emissions of CH 4 and nitrous oxide (N 2 O)."}, {"section_title": "Enteric Fermentation", "text": "Enteric fermentation is a process through which microbes present in the digestive tract of livestock break down food, emitting CH 4 as a by-product. Ruminant animals, such as cattle, sheep, and goats, have multi-chambered digestive systems that produce more CH 4 than those of non-ruminant animals. Methane emissions are also produced by monogastric (non-ruminant, e.g., swine) livestock but at a magnitude much lower than for ruminant livestock. Methane emissions from enteric fermentation depend on a combination of the following factors: predominant animal types, the quantity and quality of the diet, use of dietary additives, and the animals' activity data (e.g., work performed, pregnancy rates) (ICF International, 2013;Eve et al., 2014). The literature also indicates that a significant component in determining enteric emissions is dietary composition, which consists of overall feed intake and feed composition. For example, digestible energy (DE) in low-quality feed such as late-season forage is less than that in high-quality feed (e.g., mixed feed or spring forage). With lower quality food sources, cattle will need to eat more food in order to get the same amount of energy, thus leading to greater emissions in most cases. Increasing the ratio of grains (and other concentrates) to forage; increasing dietary fat content; and additives can decrease enteric CH 4 emissions from cattle (ICF International, 2013;Eve et al., 2014;Gerber et al., 2013). Diets rich in biofuel crop residues like distillers grains can have a higher fat content, helping to reduce enteric emissions from cattle (Lemenager et al., 2006;Latour and Schinckel, 2007). Expansion of the ethanol industry led to increased demand for corn and an increased supply of co-products from the ethanol production processes (USDA, 2009). Ethanol co-products have the potential to serve as both an economic source of cattle feed (USDA, 2009) and a means to reduce enteric emissions. However, the inclusion of additives, such as ionophores, nitrates, and tannins, have unclear long-term benefits in terms of reducing enteric CH 4 emissions. At least one study concludes that cattle consuming steam-flaked corn (SFC)-based diets produce less enteric CH 4 and preserve more energy than cattle that consume dry-rolled corn (DRC)-based diets. However, inclusion of wet distillers grains with solubles (WDGS) at 30 percent of feed composition has little effect on enteric CH 4 production and energy metabolism (Hales et al., 2012). Another study concludes that, compared with use of WDGS, using corn or wheat based DDGs in finishing cattle's diets reduced enteric CH 4 emissions by 1 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively (Wunerberg et al., 2013). Cows in intensive dairy production systems are typically fed high ratios of forages to concentrates. Feed often includes corn silage, alfalfa/ grass silage, alfalfa hay, high-moisture corn, soybean meal, and sometimes commodity feeds (e.g., corn gluten and/or dried distillers grains (DDG)). Dairy cows are fed diets that support the relevant milk production stage (ICF International, 2013). Although dairy cows are fed high quality nutrition, linked to lower enteric CH 4 emissions than lower-quality nutrition, they have a much higher TAM than beef cattle in the United States (EPA, 2015).

The anaerobic decomposition of manure results in CH 4 production and both direct and indirect pathways 16 results in N 2 O emissions. Manure management systems include variations within the following categories: solid storage, slurry systems, lagoons, and spreading. The amount of CH 4 and N 2 O generated from manure management practices depends on the animal type, animal diet, and activity data. However, the primary determinant of manure management GHG emissions is the system used to manage manure (e.g., solid storage, anaerobic lagoons, ponds). The same quantity of manure will generate different CH 4 and N 2 O emissions as the management practice defines the emission rate (ICF International, 2013;Eve et al., 2014;Gerber et al., 2013). Manure stored under anaerobic conditions produce a significant portion of all manure-related emissions (specifically, as CH 4 ), so covering anaerobic lagoons or utilizing other anaerobic digesters provides a good opportunity to reduce these emissions (ICF International, 2013; Gerber et al., 2013)."}, {"section_title": "Domestic Livestock Emissions", "text": "Overall emissions from domestic livestock production are dominated by enteric CH 4 , but manure management practices produce emissions that are still a significant component of total agricultural sector emissions.

However, there are more beef cattle than dairy cows in the United States, consequently, more overall enteric CH 4 is produced by beef cattle (ICF International, 2013).

The cattle emission factors cited in the RFS2 RIA date to 2001 (EPA, 2010a) and have since increased due to multiple factors: typical animal masses (TAMs) in the United States are increasing, dietary factors vary, and because the sub-populations of cattle (i.e., bulls, heifers, calves) and their feeding situations are constantly in flux.

The remaining 8 percent is attributed to poultry, sheep, horse, and goat production (EPA, 2015).

Enteric CH 4 emissions have increased only slightly (less than 1 percent). Although cattle populations have decreased over this time, these emissions have ticked upward due to an increase in emission factors per head, as discussed above. Manure management-related emissions of CH 4 and N 2 O have increased more significantly (about 65 percent and 25 percent, respectively) due to the increased use of liquid manure management systems in large operations (concentrated animal feeding operations or CAFOs), which are more emission-intensive than dry storage systems (EPA, 2015). Emission factors for beef cattle have increased on a per-head basis. However, emissions per pound of beef produced have decreased (ICF International, 2013). An increase in TAM of more than 10 percent resulted in only a 6 percent increase in enteric CH 4 (EPA, 2012). The recent literature indicates that the use of WDGS in feedlot diets has increased in the Southern Great Plains as a result of the growing ethanol industry. In the past few years, ethanol producers have benefited from improved margins for DDGs. Sales of DDGs now provide a significant portion of the total revenue received by ethanol facilities, offsetting almost one-third of the corn feedstock price. Increased demand for both wet and dry distillers grains as animal feed in the United States has caused an increase in the margins for the production of ethanol (EIA, 2014). Hales et al. (2013) conclude that enteric CH 4 production as a proportion of Gross Energy (GE) intake increases linearly with WDGS concentration. This relationship may increase enteric CH 4 emissions, but this is not yet documented as a trend with the overall increasing use of distillers grains. The RFS2 RIA projects livestock population changes as a result of increased ethanol production by 2022. These projections are shown in Table 2-27. The most significant change is in poultry populations under all scenarios (-58.85 million head). Swine would see significant increases under only the corn stover ethanol and switchgrass ethanol scenarios (9.15 and 7.80 million head, respectively) (EPA, 2010a). The livestock populations are based on a baseline of the 1990-2003 average populations in the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2003(EPA, 2005. For purposes of comparison, we present below average annual U.S. populations between the 1990-2003 for dairy, beef, poultry, and swine, as well as the actual 2013 populations (EPA, 2015). The trend in swine population is consistent with projections for the corn stover and switchgrass ethanol scenarios in the RIA, while the trend for dairy cattle, slightly decreasing, is consistent across all scenarios except corn stover ethanol. In the RIA, significant declines in beef population were not projected in any scenario; however, in 2011 drought resulted in early slaughter of beef herds in the Southern Plains region, which represents a significant portion of all domestic beef cattle. Poultry population was projected to decrease in all scenarios. As of 2013, the population had increased significantly in comparison to the 1990-2003 baseline. The RFS2 RIA estimates emissions based only on the projected change in livestock populations, using a per-head emission factor as described in Section 2.4.2.1. The control case livestock populations projections are not available to compare to the historical populations available from the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks (see Table 2-28).  Gerber et al. (2013) show that global GHG emissions from livestock production 17 are estimated at 3.4 metric gigaton CO 2 e per year for the 2005 reference period. About 2.7 metric gigaton CO 2 e of the sector's emissions are due to enteric fermentation, with the remainder due to manure management practices. Cattle represent about 65 percent of sector emissions, with swine, poultry, buffalo and small ruminants each having emissions levels between 7 and 10 percent of sector emissions (Gerber et al., 2013)."}, {"section_title": "International Livestock Emissions", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "International Livestock Enteric Fermentation Emissions", "text": "Enteric fermentation is the largest source of global livestock emissions (about 79 percent). Of the enteric CH 4 emissions, most of it is produced by cattle (77 percent), with buffalo producing 13 percent and the rest by small ruminants (such as sheep) (Gerber et al. 2013). In Brazil, a country that is a source of American animal product imports, cattle enteric fermentation accounts for 68 percent of all CH 4 emissions from agriculture. Beef cattle are responsible for 82 percent of all enteric methane emissions in the country (Barioni, n.d.). The RFS2 RIA models enteric CH 4 emissions with default emission factors for each region. Therefore, similar to the method for calculating domestic enteric CH 4 emissions, the trends are based only on livestock population projections, discussed in Section 2.4.3.3.

A report by Elobeid et al. (2006) estimates the long-run potential for ethanol production by calculating the corn price at which the incentive to expand ethanol production (e.g., increase the blend wall) disappears. More recent studies have examined the impact of the biofuel sector on livestock production. There is strong evidence of the increasingly tight linkage between the energy and agricultural sectors as a result of the expanding biofuel sector. The biofuel sector expands with a higher energy price, raising prices of agricultural commodities through demand-side adjustments for primary feedstocks and supply-side adjustments for substitute crops and livestock (Hayes et al., 2009). Demand for distillers grains is growing in foreign markets. In 2013, total U.S. exports of distillers grains were 9.7 million metric tons, more than double the 4.5 million metric tons of total exports in 2008. China has played a key role in driving this growth, with total distillers grains exports to China rising from 1.4 million metric tons in 2011 to 4.5 million metric tons in 2013 (EIA, 2014). This trend has continued through 2015 with 12.7 million metric tons of total U.S. exports of distillers grains, of which 6.5 million metric tons went to China (USDA, 2016b).

The module is based on multi-market, partial-equilibrium, econometric, non-spatial models. It considers a number of factors including population and GDP growth; production and consumption trends; existing trade patterns; and both international and domestic pricing. The model evaluates grains, oilseeds, livestock, dairy products, sugar and biofuels (ethanol and biodiesel) across the 54 major producing countries and regions. The area harvested was determined for each of the countries and regions, however FAPRI-CARD does not predict what type of land will be affected only the number of acres. EPA's RFS2 RIA determined the type of land using GIS data. Results showed that the international crop area harvested changed by 789 thousand hectares for the Corn Ethanol scenario in 2022. FAPRI-CARD determined the change in harvested hectares for 20 crops in 2022, as seen below in Figure  2-7. The RIA considers only the hectares associated with the \"first crop\". First crop is determined by subtracting the change in hectares from crops that would be planted for winter and spring harvest from the total hectares. The harvested hectares subtracted were for winter barley, corn safrinha, the second cropping of dry beans, winter wheat and hay. The first crop data was then separated into annual and perennial crops. Annual crops included all first crops except for palm and sugarcane hectares. Perennial crops were assumed to be palm and sugarcane harvested hectares.

These drivers include how land is allocated to biofuels, and regional policies and trends in Brazil.  A report by Boland and Unnasch (2014) entitled \"Carbon Intensity of Marginal Petroleum and Corn Ethanol Fuels\" presents a broad range of international land-use change emission estimates for corn ethanol ranging from Searchinger's 104 g CO 2 e/MJ to Argonne National Laboratory's analysis of 9.0 g CO 2 e/MJ. The latter estimate used GTAP model results and applied more accurate carbon stock factors than those used by Tyner et al. (2010). These results were incorporated into Argonne National Laboratory's GREET 1 2013 update. Boland and Unnasch (2014)   The publication states that international LUC GHG emissions should be allocated between ethanol and human dietary preferences via a human nutrition-based method (Kim et al., 2012). By applying their proposed approach, they lowered the estimate of GHG emissions by up to 73 percent when compared to the GTAP model output (Kim et al., 2012). This study elicits the notion that allocation of land goes beyond the decisions made by ethanol producers and is subject to the consumer's preference. The paper suggests that price competition of vegetable-based and animal-based proteins should be included in these economic models (Kim et al., 2012). The Institute for International Trade Negotiations (ICONE) produced a 2013 report, \"Comparing the trends and strength of determinants to deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon in consideration of biofuel policies in Brazil and the United States,\" that outlines possible drivers of deforestation in Brazil that are not considered within economic modelling. Rural settlements, which are not considered in economic modeling, are responsible for 15 percent of the total area deforested in the Amazon. The report notes that land reform and the establishment of rural settlements has increased significantly between 1995 and 2009. The rate of deforestation has also increased during this time period, however the increase has not been linear (Nassar et al., 2013). The report also observes that Brazilian states with higher pasture area also have higher rates of secondary vegetation. This trend indicates that areas previously occupied by pasture or annual crops are now in recovery for natural vegetation (Nassar et al., 2013). This reversion to natural land is an important consideration for long-term, land-use trend analyses. Lastly, recent Brazilian policies have targeted deforestation and would not be present in the current economic modelling. These policies include the Climate Change National Policy launched in 2010 which targets deforestation reduction until 2020 and efficient public policies in the Legal Amazon which lead to enforcement and compliance with the established laws and implementation of interim measures (Nassar et al., 2013). Other literature evaluates whether the increased demand for crops would cause land expansion or more efficient use of the land. Bruce Babcock and Zabid Iqbal's publication \"Using Recent Land Use Changes to Validate Land Use Change Models\" concludes increases in harvested land may be due to the more intensive use of land already in production rather than being new land into production. Based on data from the Statistics Division of FAO (FAOSTAT), the largest changes in harvested land were found in India, China, Africa, Indonesia, and Brazil (Babcock and Iqbal, 2014).  Babcock and Iqbal's analysis finds that, for different countries, a connection exists between harvested land area and double cropped land area. If the change in the second cropland area over time is positive, the perspective is that the FAO data on total harvested land over-estimates the land-use change by that amount. Table 2-32 indicates harvested land data for Brazil and India where the difference in harvested land implies that land change is driven by land-use intensification as opposed to land expansion, as implied in the RFS2 RIA FAPRI-CARD results (Babcock and Iqbal, 2014). The intensification of land use in India shown in Table 2-32 is attributed to a 6 million hectare increase in irrigated land. More irrigation allowed for a greater proportion of planted acres to be harvested. India also increased its support prices and input subsidies in the mid-2000s, which increased the value of the established cropland. The increased change in harvested land in sub-Saharan Africa is likely a better measurement of the change in planted land given the proportion of African crop production that occurs on small farms. Increased food production in the region matches the increase in the amount of land planted. Lack of technology and capital signifies that double-cropping is not common. World-wide, the extensive change (land expansion) was a net increase of 24 million hectares from 2004-2006 to 2010-2012, while the aggregate intensive land-use change was 49.1 million hectares (Babcock and Iqbal, 2014). This difference led Babcock and Iqbal to conclude that the reliability of current models would be increased if intensification of land use was considered."}, {"section_title": "Actual Land-Use Trends by Region", "text": "The FAPRI-CARD and GTAP models are the most widely used international models to predict land-use changes associated with increased biofuel production. Both models allow crop yields to respond to an increase in pricing, however they do not allow for adjustments in land-use intensity. Given the observed trends presented above in Table 2 Babcock and Iqbal looked at the intensive and extensive margin for each country/region in order to determine how much of the change in land was attributable to land expansion or double cropping. Intensive margin changes are those due to double cropping and a decrease in land that is planted but not harvested. Extensive margin changes are those that show an increase in harvested land. Figure 2-11 below shows their analysis of FAOSTAT data between 2004-2006 to 2010-2012 for each country/region indicating whether the change in harvested land area was intensive or extensive (Babcock and Iqbal, 2014).

They conclude that the predicted land-use change within Brazil due to higher prices is far too high relative to the surrounding countries. The FAPRI-CARD results predicted almost no land-use change in Argentina due to high prices (Babcock and Iqbal, 2014).

Based on this trend, the FAPRI-CARD results for the RFS2 RIA underestimated Africa's connection to the world commodity market, and the impact that the connectedness would have on extensive land-use change (Babcock and Iqbal, 2014)."}, {"section_title": "Alternative to FAPRI-CARD Modelling", "text": "Given that the attributes and assumptions of the FAPRI-CARD analysis may not reflect actual land use change trends, other models provide an alternative analysis to develop international land-use estimates. FAPRI-CARD, as noted in Section 2.5.1, is a partial-equilibrium model that is multi-market and nonspatial. Because the model is non-spatial, it does not distinguish between the sources and destinations of trade between regions and countries (FAPRI, 2008). FAPRI did not develop an updated 2011 baseline due to budget constraints, causing this data output to be antiquated. GTAP is a computable equilibrium model with perfect competition and links production and consumption by region. The GTAP-BIO model is specifically tailored to estimate the land use impact of an exogenous policy shock. The GTAP-BIO database has been updated based on trends in land-use patterns and updated data are available. In the EPA RIA analysis, geospatial data was used to distinguish which types of land were converted and reverted while GTAP's output includes this modeled data. GTAP allows three land types to be used for biofuel production: forest, grassland, and cropland-pasture land. Crop-pasture land is agricultural land that has been converted to agriculture dominated by the production of biofuel feedstocks. GTAP results are available for two pertinent biofuel production scenarios. Both scenarios reflect a shock of 11.59 billion gallons of increased demand for corn as a feedstock commodity. Scenario Case A was modeled in 2011 and Case H was modelled in 2013 (Argonne National Laboratory, 2014). The production scenarios are shown below in Table 2-33 and were taken from Argonne National Laboratory's Carbon Calculator for Land Use Change from Biofuels Production (CCLUB) model. Although Case A and H model the same production volume, there were key aspects within the GTAP model run that cause different results. ICF 67 January 12, 2017 \uf06e Land Transformation: Land transformation elasticity reflects the ease of land transition from one state to another. A low value indicates limited land transitions. In 2011, GTAP included only one land transformation elasticity for the world. Taheripour and Tyner (2013) updated the land transformation data to develop region-specific elasticities using two United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization land-cover datasets. The updates allowed for determination of changes in agricultural land area and the characterization of changes in harvested area for crop types. Based on this change, Taheripour and Tyner (2013) found that that the United States moved a sizeable amount of agricultural land to produce corn and oilseed crops without significant expansion in overall agricultural land (Argonne National Laboratory, 2014). \uf06e Treatment of Conversion Costs: In 2011, converting pasture and forest to cropland cost the same amount. In 2013, GTAP was adjusted to reflect the greater cost of converting of forest to cropland compared to converting pasture to cropland. In the updated dataset, it is more costly to convert forest to cropland than in the prior model version. Taheripour and Tyner (2013) used observed land-use trends as a guide for the most recent update of GTAP. This methodology was used to reconcile the differences between modeled predictions and the observed trends. They specifically address how land-use changes responded to changes in global commodity pricing. The raw GTAP data is grouped by land-use type (forest, grassland, cropland pasture, and cropland).

Global rice harvest estimates from both the USDA Rice Yearbook and the FAO data show an overall increase in acreage from 1990 through 2014 with slight differences between them (USDA ERS, 2015; FAO, 2016a). For example, the USDA Rice Yearbook estimated more harvested acres than the FAO seven out of the 15 years between 1990 and 2004, and the FAO estimated higher acreage the remaining eight years. However, between 2005 through 2012 the FAO consistently estimates more acreage than the USDA Rice Yearbook and the difference between the estimates increases to 5 to 10 million acres.

The difference between the RFS2 RIA FAPRI-CARD and the USDA and FAO acreage is greatest between 2010 and 2014 where the RFS2 RIA FAPRI-CARD estimates are between 5 million and 15 million acres lower than the USDA and FAO data. Given that the RFS2 RIA consistently underestimates acres of harvested rice (especially between 2010 and 2014) the RFS2 RIA most likely underestimates global methane emissions from rice production for both cases (depending on the emission factors used).

Table 2-44 shows the GHG emissions from corn ethanol production facilities reported under the EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) and corn ethanol production from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Ethanol production facilities are required to report emissions under the GHGRP if they meet the reporting threshold of 25,000 metric tons of CO 2 equivalent per year for all emissions sources covered in program (40 CFR Part 98). Applicable Subparts are likely to include Subpart C (stationary combustion), Subpart HH (municipal solid waste landfills), and Subpart II (wastewater treatment).Emissions are primarily from fuel combustion on-site from both fossil and biogenic fuel sources. The GHGRP and EIA data show that the total national GHG intensity has declined by 4 percent between 2010 and 2014. In addition, corn ethanol yields continue to improve. Figure 2-12 shows that as the corn ethanol production has grown, the industry has become more efficient, using fewer bushels of corn to produce a gallon of ethanol. Several factors contributed to the yield increases from a bushel of corn. Increased scale has allowed producers to incorporate better process technology, such as finer grinding of corn to increase starch conversion and improved temperature control of fermentation to optimize yeast productivity. The growth of the corn ethanol industry also enabled the development of better enzymes and yeast strains for improved output per bushel of corn. 22\nThere are two methods for producing ethanol from corn: dry milling and wet milling. The dry milling process included grinding the entire corn kernel and fermenting it to produce ethanol. The rest of the corn components are left wet or dried for animal feed-i.e., dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS). Wet milling includes separating the starch from the kernel by soaking the corn kernel, and then using the starch to make the ethanol. This process is more expensive than dry milling. Dry mill plants comprises the majority of ethanol plants in the United States.

This estimate is similar to the value projected for 2022 by the EPA (2010) report. The Argonne report acknowledged that major energy efficiency improvements could be made to the system if corn and corn stover processes were combined, utilizing combined heat and power (CHP) from the corn stover process. The same research team produced a refined LCA of corn ethanol that detailed the benefits of dried distillers grain (DGS) and corn oil recovery in ethanol production . The study applied four different allocation techniques in determining the variations in effects of the co-products on the final GHG intensity: marginal energy allocation, hybrid market-value allocation, process-level allocation, and soy biodiesel displacement. This methodology estimated the life-cycle GHG intensity of corn ethanol production to range between 15-20 g CO 2 e/MJ, a 33-50 percent reduction from the EPA report, depending on the co-product handling method used. For the marginal and displacement methods, ethanol production values are similar to Wang et al. 2012, but a DGS displacement credit reduces the life-cycle emissions. The hybrid-market and process-level allocation methods do not use a displacement credit, and allocate a share of the production burden to the DGS co-product based on the specific method. Boland and Unnasch (2014) projected significant reductions in life-cycle corn ethanol GHG intensity, using the EPA (2010) report as a baseline. This study assessed a corn and corn stover ethanol production pathway with 10 variations in fuel and co-products. The dry mill production variations using natural gas ranged from 20-35 g CO 2 e/MJ. Substituting biomass in place of natural gas resulted in 10 g CO 2 e/MJ, a 67 percent reduction from the EPA report. The study projected these GHG intensities to decline by 8-20 percent from 2012-2022 due to efficiency improvements.

FASOM constructed crop budgets for 11 market regions, which varied by crop, management practice, and region. Within these crop budgets, data on crop yield, fertilizer, pesticides, and fuels used were included. These budgets did not reflect input or yield changes that may result in altered crop rotation patterns or the use of marginal land. The energy use in FASOM represented the fuels used for grain drying. It was based on the assumptions that 17.5 gallons of propane and 9 kWh of electricity were required to remove 10 percentage points of moisture from 100 bushels of grain. The total energy use per acre was determined by multiplying the energy use per percentage point per yield unit for each crop that is dried (i.e., bushel of grain) by the total number of percentage points to be removed and the yield per acre. The emission factors used for the fertilizers and pesticides were from the Greenhouse Gas, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (GREET) spreadsheet analysis tool developed by Argonne National Laboratories. GREET version 1.8c was primarily used. The electricity emission factors represent average U.S. grid electricity production and were also based on GREET . Field burning of crop residues is not considered a net source of CO 2 , because the carbon released to the atmosphere as CO 2 during burning is assumed to be reabsorbed during the next growing season. Field burning of crop residues, however, also emits N 2 O and CH 4 , which are considered a net source of GHG emissions.\nThe FASOM model includes the land-use categories cropland, cropland pasture, forestland, forest pasture, rangeland, developed land, and acres enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). The model determines how much of each land-use category is actively used in production and how much is idle during a specific time period. Since the publication of the EPA RIA, FASOM has been updated to allow analysis across the forest and agricultural sector combined as opposed to separate runs of the forest and agricultural sector components. These model updates are not reflected in the RIA results. FASOM did not explicitly account for the corn oil extracted from distillers grain. Since the RIA, the model has been modified to add this pathway as part of the dry milling process. The original analysis is based on the assumption that by 2022, 70 percent of dry mill ethanol plants will withdraw corn oil via extraction, 20 percent will withdraw corn oil via fractionation, and 10 percent will do neither (EPA, 2010a). Since the RIA, FASOM was also updated with distillers grain and soluble replacement rates for corn and soybean meal in animal feed. These replacement rates are based on research published by Argonne National Laboratory (Arora et al., 2008). For the corn ethanol scenario, the relative demand for crop and livestock production had a direct and indirect effect on land use. These assumptions are presented in Table 3-11. The land-use allocation over time is shown in Figure 3-1 for the Fuel-Specific Scenario. Source: RTI International, 2010. The land-use change is modelled across three phenomena: 1. Developed Land: FASOM assumed that developed land is of higher value than all other land categories, the amount of developed land increased at a steady rate over time and the rate of urbanization is assumed to be exogenous based on projections of population and income growth. 2. Carbon Sequestration: FASOM accounted for carbon storage in trees, understory, and litter within both forests and plantations of woody biofuel feedstocks but excludes carbon stored in annually cultivated crops. Changes in sequestration for land moved from the forestry and agricultural sectors into developed land is tracked within FASOM. 3. Agricultural Land-Use Change GHG Emission Factors: FASOM agricultural land GHG emission factors were updated with the DAYCENT/CENTURY model runs to reflect scientific updates at the time of the model runs (RTI International, 2010). To calculate the annualized timing of cumulative GHG emissions due to land-use change, all emissions associated with agricultural land (CO 2 and N 2 O from cropland, pastureland, and CRP land) and forestland between 2000 and 2022 (CO 2 from biomass, soil, and forest products) are summed as the emissions from these categories accumulate over time. EPA's RIA states, \"The GHG emissions associated with converting land into crop production would accumulate over time with the largest release occurring in the first few years due to clearing with fire or biomass decay. After the land is converted, moderate amounts of soil carbon would continue to be released for approximately 20 years. Furthermore, there would be foregone sequestration associated with the fact that the forest would have continued to sequester carbon had it not been cleared for approximately 80 years.\"\nFASOM was used to model the methane emissions from rice produced in the United States that is grown in flooded fields (Adams et al., 2005). The model assumed that a reduction of rice acreage corresponded in a reduction in rice cultivation methane emissions. The model did not consider any additional changes in rice cultivation practices (e.g., nutrient management, ratooning) that could also affect emissions. Therefore, the changes in emissions from rice cultivation were the direct result of changes in the planted acreage within the model. Methane emissions per acre were calculated based on the regional emission factors by acre for each region based on the EPA's U.S. GHG inventory for 1990-2003(EPA, 2005. FASOM assumed that rice methane emissions would decrease for all fuel pathways, including corn ethanol production due to decreased domestic rice acreage. Table 3-18 shows the emission factors used in FASOM.  Table 3-19 shows the relative emissions change based on the change in acreage from rice production to corn production. EPA's analysis resulted in a reduction of 42,000 tons CO 2 e (see Table 2.4-10 from EPA RIA).\nFASOM was used to model the changes in methane emissions associated with livestock enteric fermentation and manure management based on changes in the number of livestock. FASOM models the change in livestock production as costs for feed changes due to corn ethanol production. The enteric fermentation emissions were determined based on the number of livestock by type, and the average emissions per animal. Within FASOM, emissions mitigation options are available, however in EPA's analysis they were not used. Enteric fermentation emissions were estimated based on the number of animals within each livestock category (Adams et al., 2005).\nBased on a similar methodology to the domestic livestock impacts, the FAPRI-CARD model determined the change in livestock production based on feed prices, and these changes were multiplied by the GHG emission factors for both enteric fermentation and manure management. The enteric fermentation emissions were determined based on the number of livestock by type, and the average emissions per animal. The manure management emissions similarly were determined by applying regional default methane and nitrous oxide emission factors by livestock type to the regional livestock production . The default emission factors for both the enteric fermentation and the manure management emissions are based on the default IPCC emission factors by regional practice .\nThe activity data for international farm inputs are based on the following methods and sources: \uf06e Fertilizer Application Rates: The changes in crop area and production by crop type and country output from the FAPRI-CARD model was used to determine the applied amount of fertilizer. Regional fertilizer application rates (kg/ha) were taken from the International Fertilizer Industry Association (IFA) report, \"Assessment of Fertilizer Use by Crop at the Global Level, 2006Level, /07-2007.\" The report covers 23 countries and 11 crops groups. The RFS2 RIA averaged the results from two reporting periods (2006/2007 and 2007/2008) (Heffer, 2009) to account for seasonal applications. The application rates were then divided by the total consumption by the FAOStat agricultural area data from the FAOStat database . The IFA report did not include lime use for corn and therefore this international input was omitted from the corn ethanol analysis.  Agricultural Energy Use: The International Energy Agency's (IEA) data on total CO 2 emissions from agricultural electricity and fuel use by country was gathered for on-farm diesel, gasoline, and electricity use. The emissions associated with combustion were then calculated using IEA countrylevel GHG emission factors. The combustion emissions were then proportionally scaled to represent the entire fuel life cycle based on the ratio of combustion to life-cycle GHG emissions from U.S. electricity and fuel use provided by IEA (IEA, 2015). The life-cycle emissions were then divided by the area of agricultural land in each country, from the FAOSTAT land area database . The emissions per land area were then multiplied by the country-level crop acreage changes from FAPRI-CARD to determine the fuel-related emission for corn ethanol.\nBased on the IPCC methodology used in the EPA RIA, the area of rice harvested, a GHG emission factor, and the planting to harvest season length are required. The FAPRI-CARD model was used to predict the impact of increased biofuels demand in the United States on international rice production and the area of rice harvested. The IPCC default emission factors for irrigated, rainfed lowland, upland, and deepwater by country were used . The rice cultivation season length was based on data from the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) (IRRI, 2008)."}, {"section_title": "EPA RIA Results", "text": "National-level input data for domestic farm inputs based on the FASOM output are shown in Table 3-1. The RIA provides the domestic inputs in units per MMBtu as they are attributed to the corn ethanol production. These values were combined with the upstream emission factors from GREET to calculate the GHG emissions from the production of fertilizer, herbicides, pesticides, and fuels. The GHG emission factors for the domestic farm inputs can be found in Table 3-3. Upstream emissions for diesel, gasoline, electricity, and natural gas are discussed in the Fuel Production section. The FASOM output for the N 2 O emissions is shown in Table 3-2. In the calculation spreadsheets, the analysis in some cases was only performed for the volume difference between the corn-ethanol scenario and the control case scenario. The negative values below represent negative emissions. The activity data from Table 3-1 was then multiplied by the emission factors shown in Table 3-3 to calculate the total emissions for domestic farm inputs. Source: GREET output; \"Renewable Fuel Lifecycle Greenhouse Gas Calculations (1).xlsx,\" \"Emission Factors\" tab. In the RIA, this category of emissions is projected to be 10,313 g CO 2 e/MMBtu for domestic agricultural inputs by 2022 (the emission intensity was not reported for 2014). \nThe aggregate GHG emissions from domestic land-use changes are a result of the difference in land-use change and management practices in 2022 and dependent on changes in the land-use patterns that occurred prior to 2022. FASOM generates GHG emissions estimates with land-use change for every fiveyear period within the identified timeframe (Adams et al., 2005). Using these data, the EPA RIA calculated the GHG emissions changes for corn ethanol and annualized the cumulative change (EPA, 2010a). The change in emissions is shown in Figure 3-2.  Table 3-12 below shows the same EPA RIA result in g CO 2 e/MMBtu. \nThe RIA estimated the overall contribution of domestic rice methane to the corn ethanol life-cycle GHG emissions to be less than \u2212500 g CO 2 e/MMBtu. The RIA value is shown in Table 3-20 below. \nThe emission factors per animal are based on EPA's U.S. GHG inventory report for 1990-2003 and are presented in Table 3 -24 (EPA, 2005).   In the RIA, corn ethanol was projected to result in a change in domestic livestock emissions of \u22123,746 g CO 2 e/MMBtu. \nChanges in livestock numbers attributed to the RFS2 are shown in Table 3-33. The differences shown are the difference (in thousand livestock head) between the Fuel-Specific Scenario and the Control Scenario.  The RIA projected emissions due to U.S. corn ethanol production from changes in international livestock production as 3,458 g CO 2 e/MMBtu in 2022. \nFigure 3-3 presents the harvest area changes by crop and region. These results are for the corn ethanol scenario for 2022. The total change in international crop area harvested for 2022 corn ethanol was 789,000 hectares, which results in 3.94 hectares/billion Btus (see Table 2.4-29 from EPA RIA) (EPA, 2010a). The change in international pasture area decreased by 446,000 hectares, which resulted in a decrease of 2.23 hectares/billion Btus (see Table 2.4-32 from EPA RIA) (EPA, 2010a). The emission impacts for each region are shown in Table 3-38. These emission factors reflect the amount of carbon dioxide associated with each MMBtu of corn ethanol by region associated with the increased demand for corn ethanol and annualized over 30 years. Positive values indicated increases in emissions associated with the change in land use. \nActivity data for the international farm inputs analysis are shown in Table 3-45.

The international change in agricultural energy use for corn ethanol in 2022 is 1.7 kg CO 2 e/MMBtu (see Table 2.4-18 from EPA RIA). The RIA estimates are: 672 g CO 2 e/MMBtu for agricultural inputs, 3,380 g CO 2 e/MMBtu for direct and indirect N 2 O emission, and 1,700 g CO 2 e/MMBtu for energy emissions, which result in a reported total of: 5,720 g CO 2 e/MMBtu (5,752 g CO 2 e/MMBtu actual total). \nThe area of rice harvested internationally was calculated on an annual basis.

"}, {"section_title": "ICF Methodology and Data Sources", "text": "ICF analyzed the GHG emissions impact of RFS2-related corn ethanol production on domestic agricultural inputs-specifically, nitrogen (N) fertilizer, phosphorus (P) fertilizer, potassium (K) fertilizer, herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides-and fuel consumption. Upstream emissions factors are included for all chemical applications and the direct and indirect N 2 O emissions from nitrogen fertilizer applications are evaluated. The upstream and on-site diesel fuel impacts are also included in the analysis. For chemical application rates (calculated based on the percent of acres applying a particular chemical and pounds applied per acre), ICF utilized the most recent Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) data for corn, which is for 2010 and is provided separately for the ten USDA Farm Production Regions (USDA ERS 2016). ICF utilized the national average fungicide application rates for all regions except for the Corn Belt region, due to the lack of data for these regions. We assumed that the diesel fuel use is 7.74 gallons per corn-acre under conventional tillage, based on 2015 farm budget worksheets (UT 2015). To calculate the effective chemical application rates, ICF multiplied the application rates in each region (pounds per acre) by the percent of acres in each region that apply each fertilizer or pesticide (USDA ERS 2016). 26 Table 3-5 present the results of this analysis. ARMS data did not report corn acres in the Delta and Pacific regions, hence they these regions are excluded from Table 3-5 (USDA ERS 2016). ICF used the RIA's projected number of additional bushels of corn in the control scenario (i.e., compliance with the RFS2 regulation), compared to the reference scenario (i.e., no RFS2 is enacted) (773,956,000 bushels in 2017, which we assume is also the marginal increase for 2014) to determine the additional number of corn acres that can be attributed to the RFS2 rule. This projected change in bushels was divided by the most recent USDA corn yield data (168.4 bushels per acre in 2015) (USDA NASS, 2016). The resultant additional acres of corn are presented in Table 3-6, were then allocated by region based on the ARMS corn acreage data by region (USDA ERS, 2016). The total projected change in acreage under ICF's analysis is 4.9 million acres in 2017 and 3.4 million acres in 2022. For comparison, the RIA projected an additional 4.9 million acres in 2017 and 3.6 million acres in 2022. These acreage increases are less than 6 percent of the total acreage. ICF multiplied the acreages in Table 3-6 by the individual fertilizer and fuel emission factors. Life-cycle emission factors for diesel fuel (on-site and upstream), fertilizers (N, P, and K) and insecticide were based on Argonne National Laboratory's GREET 2015 model (Argonne National Laboratory 2015). Emission factors for herbicides and fungicides are from ecoinvent v2 found in SimaPro. These emission factors are cradle to gate and include the emissions from the upstream production of agricultural chemicals (Weidema et al. 2013), but do not include emissions after the farm \"gate\" from application. The direct and indirect N 2 O emissions from N-fertilizer applications (on-site and downstream) are based on IPCC guidance for rates for each kilogram of N fertilizer applied . IPCC provides N mineralized from mineral soil as a result of loss of soil carbon, as well as volatilization and leaching (as N 2 O-N). The factors of 168.4 bushels of corn per acre (USDA NASS, 2016) and 2.8 gallons of ethanol per bushel of corn from (GREET, 2015) were used to convert emissions per acre to emissions per MMBtu of ethanol. Note: 1 metric ton = 1,000 kg = 1,000,000 g\nICF estimated the domestic land-use change GHG emissions from expanding cropland to produce corn for ethanol production using the most recent related datasets, analyses, and available LUC models. The RIA relied on projections and estimates from the Forest and Agricultural Sector Optimization Model (FASOM), which are discussed above. Actual U.S. corn acreage through 2014 has exceeded the RIA acreage projections. The domestic LUC assessment combines new domestic acreage change estimates with improved carbon flux emission factors. The RIA domestic LUC analysis used FASOM acreage change projections and emission factors. In the ICF analysis, we used emission factors from FASOM that had been updated with DAYCENT/CENTURY modeling efforts. These emission factors better reflect irrigation effects and N 2 O emissions from cropland and pastureland. The RIA assessed CO 2 and N 2 O emissions from cropland, pastureland, and Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) acreage conversions, as well as CO 2 emissions from projected conversions of forest to cropland. For the RIA, the total emissions were summed for all the conversions to generate cumulative GHG emissions over the time horizon (2000-2022). ICF's domestic LUC analysis closely followed the 2015 GREET model's Carbon Calculator for Land Use Change from Biofuels Production (CCLUB) ). ICF's specific method used U.S. acreage conversions to corn ethanol from the previously described GTAP model available within CCLUB. GTAP quantifies acreage change for 18 Agro-ecological Zones (AEZs), but only AEZs 7-16 are relevant (i.e., non-zero) for the United States. 27 The types of acreage included are forests, grassland, cropland-pasture, and young forest shrub (YF shrub). YF shrub acreage change and conversion emissions were quantified by applying the relevant forest correction factor to the forest conversion values and emission factors for the GTAP model only. Table 3-13 shows the GTAP data for the AEZs, land types, and GTAP dataset year (2011, 2013). The improvements made in the GTAP model between 2011 and 2013 resulted in the significant decreases in acres converted. ICF performed our analysis on the 2013 model results. Negative values denote reductions of each land type (e.g. forest, grassland, crop-pasture) that are converted to feedstock (corn). A positive value would denote an increase in land of that type.  -639,484 -1,788,462 -1,168,943  -13,999 -66,568 ICF varied the acreage conversion GHG emissions for the three available models in CCLUB for domestic LUC: Century/COLE, Woods Hole, and Winrock. Century/COLE included regional variations (AEZs) for all available GTAP acreage changes, along with non-soil and annual growth emissions. Winrock included three emission factor options (forest, grassland, cropland-pasture), and Woods Hole two (forest, grassland). The Century/COLE emission factors also provided variations for tillage and soil depth, which were included as scenarios in the final results. For each LUC variation, the total cumulative emissions were annualized for the CCLUB default input of 30 years. We converted the results to the final g CO 2 e/MMBtu based on the CCLUB values for annual ethanol production increases from the 2004 base year (11.59 billion gallons to reach the 15 billion gallons mandate) and lower heating value (76,330 Btu/gal). Sections 2.2.2 and 2.2.3 of the literature review detail the Winrock and Woods Hole conversion emission factors, respectively. Table 3-14 and Table 3-15 show the Century/COLE emission factor variations for the conventional and reduced till scenarios assessed in Chapter 3. Emission factors varied by AEZ, soil depth (100 cm, 30 cm), and land conversion type. Positive emission factors denote carbon emissions from the soil and negative values denote sequestration of carbon within the soil.  Table 3-16 shows the final results for all the scenarios run using the CCLUB methodology. Conservatively, ICF recommends utilizing the Century/Cole 100 cm conventional till scenario of \u22122,038 g CO 2 e/MMBtu.  Table 3-17 shows the ICF current conditions value, which utilizes the CCLUB model with 2013 GTAP acreage change data. \nChapter 2 identified several areas where recent trends in domestic rice production, and the associated methane emissions differ from the production and emissions projected in the RIA. Most notably, at least through 2014, the RIA overestimated total rice acreage (and thus the associated methane emissions). Countering these overestimates, however, the RIA used the IPCC AR2 CH 4 GWP of 21. The IPCC revised this GWP to 25 in AR4, which implies a downward bias in the projected CH 4 emissions associated with domestic rice production in the RIA. In this analysis, ICF used a methodology similar to that used in the RIA but incorporates new rice production data and uses the AR4 CH 4 GWP. ICF determined the GHG emission impact of RFS2-related corn ethanol production on domestic rice methane emissions using the following methodology. Step 1 identified the difference in harvested rice acreage and associated emissions between the control case (i.e., where corn ethanol production has expanded under the RFS2) and the reference case (i.e., no RFS2). EPA projections for harvested rice acreage (based on FASOM simulations) for 2012 and 2017 for three scenarios are shown in Table 3-21 where increased corn production for ethanol results in reduced domestic rice acres. Values for 2014 are interpolated from the 2012 and 2017 values. The \"Corn Only Case\" shows FASOM model results that exclude any effects of other RFS2 biofuels on the control case (i.e., the control case reflects full multifuel compliance with the RFS2). To calculate the total rice methane emissions, ICF used the same regional assessment method as the RIA. As discussed and detailed in the literature review (see Section 2.3.3), the regional acreage and associated emission factors have been updated in recent EPA reports. Our assessment used these data (EPA 2016) to calculate new results for methane emissions in both reference and control cases. The acreage data in the recent reports were used as the control case, and ICF determined reference and corn only case acreage by applying the average ratio of reference acreage to control acreage and corn only to control acreage from the available projections (see Table 3-21). Table 3-22 indicates the ICF scenario acreages and associated emissions for the regions assessed. To estimate a final life-cycle emission factor, ICF calculated the difference in total GHG emissions (all regions included) between the \"reference case\" and \"corn only case\" scenarios to quantify the incremental GHG emissions from the reference to the corn only case. These incremental emissions were then divided by the incremental corn ethanol production from the RIA's reference and corn only case (3.03 billion gallons in 2014). We then converted this GHG emissions per volume of ethanol value to an emission factor (g CO 2 e/MMBtu) using the heating value of ethanol to convert the volume in gallons to energy in Btus.\nIn the RIA, EPA estimated the impact of the RFS2 on future livestock populations by modeling the change in livestock with and without the RFS2. ICF utilized the RIA change in livestock population data for dairy cows (mature only), beef cattle, swine, and poultry in conjunction with revised emission factors for these livestock types for enteric fermentation and manure management from the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gases Emissions and Sinks: 1990(EPA 2016. For poultry populations, ICF assumed that the change in population shown in the RIA represented a change in poultry slaughtered, rather than the change in annual average poultry populations. In order to apply the annual emission factor developed in the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gases Emissions and Sinks: 1990(EPA 2016, ICF first had to use a scaling factor to adjust poultry populations. For dairy, beef, and swine populations, ICF used the RIA estimated changes in population directly. To estimate the livestock emissions impacts from the implementation of the RFS2, ICF utilized the difference between the RIA's control and reference cases, as shown in Table 3-27. Given that the RIA did not report a change in head for intermediate years, and given our methodology, ICF was not able to estimate associated emission estimates for intermediate years (i.e., 2014). As a result, we have used the same domestic livestock result of our analysis for 2022 as the domestic livestock contribution in our estimation of the LCA value for 2014. \nThere is very limited data related to international livestock populations for determining the current population of livestock. ICF utilized the RIA international livestock population changes for the corn ethanol case modeled by FAPRI-CARD for 2022 (EPA 2010). The population changes for diary, beef, swine, sheep, and poultry are shown in Table 3-36. For international livestock emission factors, ICF analyzed updated factors as available for enteric methane and methane and N 2 O emissions from manure management. The only available updated factors for international livestock were for Canadian cattle. The other international livestock data in the RIA were distributed by global region, so we were unable to update effective emission factors.\nTo evaluate the impact of U.S. production of corn ethanol on international land-use change, ICF utilized a variety of land-use change modeling results that have been published since 2010, as well as recent data and analysis on international land-use change that were not available when the RIA was conducted. We also considered alternative emission factors for land converted. A review of published literature finds that much of the international land-use change impacts projected in the RIA have not materialized. As a result, the emissions path associated with land-use change in the RIA is much higher than those that have been estimated based on current conditions, and estimated for future years.\nICF calculated the emissions impacts of changes in international agricultural input use related to higher levels of corn ethanol production under the RFS2 based on changes in international cropland acres attributable to increased U.S. production of corn ethanol. To assess this acreage change, ICF used the output of the GTAP model from 2013 , which reflects an increase of 11.59 billion gallons of corn ethanol. 31 ICF used the GTAP 2013 changes in acres for the international inputs acres instead of the GTAP 2013 adjusted acres based on Babcock and Iqbal (2014) data. The GTAP 2013 acres are a more accurate representation as they are based on the most recent data available. For more information on the change in acres due to an increased demand in U.S corn ethanol, see the International Land-Use Change section. ICF based fertilizer, fungicide, insecticide, and herbicide application rates on the rates developed for the RIA. These application rates are based on data collected by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the International Energy Agency (IEA) and compiled in FAO's FertiStat Database (EPA 2010b). ICF updated the herbicide and pesticide use data using the most current data available from FAO's FAOStat dataset for pesticide consumption (see Venezia et al. 2009). ICF combined the application rates into a weighted average by GTAP region. The weighting was based on the countries' percent contribution of arable land by region. The arable land area was take from FAO. Life-cycle emission factors for nitrogen, phosphate, potassium, calcium carbonate, and insecticide were based on Argonne National Laboratory's GREET 2015 model (Argonne National Laboratory 2015). Emission factors for herbicides and insecticides are from ecoinvent v2 found in SimaPro. These emission factors are cradle to gate and include the emissions from the upstream production of agricultural chemicals (Weidema et al. 2013). The direct and indirect N 2 O emission calculations are based on IPCC (2006) guidance. The guidance uses the nitrogen fertilizer application to assess the direct impacts including the N additions from fertilizer, and the N mineralized from mineral soil as a result of loss of soil carbon. The nitrogen fertilizer application rate is also used to calculate the indirect emissions from volatization and leaching . Emissions associated with agricultural energy were calculated using the same methodology as the RIA. The RIA used IEA data on total CO 2 emissions from agricultural fuel combustion by country. These emissions were combined with agricultural electricity use by country. The total emissions were then scaled to represent the full life-cycle GHG emissions for each country. Finally, these emissions were divided by the FAOstat land area to derive a per acre GHG emissions factor for each country (EPA 2010). The emission factors developed for the RIA were not updated because IEA no longer publically releases country-specific emission factors. While the emission factors used in this analysis are the same as those in the RIA, they are multiplied by the change in acres data from GTAP 2013. Table 3-48 shows the emissions contributions from each of the international agricultural inputs.

These products are sold into the animal feed market. The lifecycle analysis (LCA) standard approach for handling these animal feed co-products (see Argonne's GREET model, the California Air Resources Board, and EPA) is to credit the co-product via the displacement methodology. For the displacement methodology, all of the energy and emissions for farming, fertilizer, feedstock transport, and ethanol production are allocated to the primary product from ethanol production (i.e., the ethanol), and the ethanol pathway is credited for co-product displacing animal feed. ICF utilized the GREET 2015 assumptions for the breakdown of the animal feed components, including corn, soybean meal, urea, and soybean oil, that are being displaced. Table 3-8 indicates that feed displacement values vary by ethanol refining process and displaced animal feed.  "}, {"section_title": "ICF Results", "text": "The combined domestic agricultural inputs emissions related to the RFS2 rule in 2014 (i.e., under current conditions) is approximately 9,065 g CO 2 e/MMBtu. This estimate is the sum of the ethanol co-product credit in Table 3-9 (\u221212,749 g CO 2 e/MMBtu) and the domestic inputs emissions impact in Table 3-7 (+21,814 g CO 2 e/MMBtu). The difference in emissions from the EPA RIA is small and is attributed primarily to the lower GWP value for N 2 O in AR4 and the slightly higher chemical application rates used in our analysis. \n\nRelative to the RIA, ICF found an increased reduction in corn ethanol emissions associated with changes in domestic rice production related to RFS2 compliance. The ICF value is shown in Table 3-23 below. \nIn our analysis, the combined emissions are \u22122,463 g CO 2 e/MMBtu. The differences between the results of this analysis and the RIA's analysis can largely be attributed to the revised assumptions used in GREET to calculate the reduced methane emissions from DGS fed to livestock. \nThe primary changes to the emissions impacts from international livestock as a result of the corn ethanol portion of the RFS2 rule are due to the updated GWPs (and updated emission factors for Canada). Additionally, we have projected population changes only for 2022. The emissions impact is 3,894 g CO 2 e/MMBtu. The assessment assumes that the social, political, and economic forces that drove land-use change during this period of time will remain the same through 2022. The international land-use change emission impacts are based on: \uf06e Land Conversion Categories: The different types of land conversions were analyzed with satellite data to show their location and the land-cover types affected in order to estimate the international land-use change. \uf06e Forest Carbon Stock Estimates: EPA's emission factors incorporated spatial, region-specific maps derived using adjusted biome-level Tier 1 default values from IPCC and supplemented with countryspecific data sources (Ruesch and Gibbs, 2008).\nBased on the updated data for changes in acres as well as emission factors, ICF generated a range of estimates for the international land-use change caused by increased U.S. corn demand based on the available acre change and emission factor data sets. An average value for the international land-use change emission category was calculated taking these estimates and recently published (i.e., 2015 and 2016) values from the literature. The estimates assumed an increase of 11.59 billion gallons of ethanol and the emissions are amortized over the 30 year period (EPA 2010). The 11.59 billion gallons of reflects the total additional amount of corn ethanol required by the RFS2 compared to the production volume in place prior to the RFS1 in 2004. The emissions below would be released annually due to this increased demand. These estimates are presented below in Table 3-43. All emission calculations presented above are lower that EPA's RIA estimate of the impacts from international land-use change. In regards to acreage data, the GTAP 2013 modelling scenario is more conservative than the GTAP 2013 adjusted with Babcock and Iqbal (2014) data. Although the quantitative analysis conducted by Babcock and Iqbal (2014) attempts to better represent the actual acreage change for the five regions due to corn ethanol production, the evidence is not strong enough to solely recommend the qualitative adjustments that were made. The GTAP 2013 adjusted with Babcock and Iqbal (2014) data with Winrock emission factors scenario provides the lower bound for this estimate and illustrates that increased corn ethanol demand could have only a small impact on international land-use change. The ARB LCFS AEZ does have higher emissions impact estimates than the Winrock data. This analysis is in line with what was observed during the literature review, where it was determined (see Section 2.2) that ARB LCFS AEZ would provide the highest emission estimates. These values provide the upper bound for this analysis. To reflect the full range of recently published literature relating to the contribution of international landuse change to the current GHG profile of corn ethanol, ICF adopted a composite approach that averaged the results of three recently published studies (CARB, 2015;and GTAP, 2013) and four scenarios developed from their results that allow for alternative sets of emissions factors and the increased use of double cropping (Babcock and Iqbal, 2014). These seven results are shown in Figure 3-4.  quantify two emissions related to international land-use change distinguished by the use of the Winrock and the Woods Hole emissions factors (EFs). ICF developed four scenarios from the results of the most recently published GTAP study (GTAP 2013) to account for the use of ARB EFs and Winrock EFs as well as increased double cropping (denoted \"Adjusted\" in . Across these seven results, the average emissions impact is 8.61 g CO 2 e/MJ. This value converts to 9,082 g CO 2 e/MMBtu, which is the value ICF used as the contribution of international land-use change to corn ethanol's current GHG profile (see Table 3-44).  \nThese values are significantly lower than the RIA's estimates. The main driver of this difference is that GTAP 2013 modelling predicts a 73 percent reduction in hectares changed due to corn ethanol demands. \nThe final life-cycle emissions for changes in international rice acres were determined using the same method that was used to determine the emissions associated with changes in domestic rice methane production. The total GHG emissions associated with the acreage difference between the control and reference cases (see Table 3-54) was divided by the annual RFS2 incremental corn ethanol production (3.03 billion gallons in 2014). Using the (lower) heating value of 76,330 (Btu/gallon), the emissions are 1,480 g CO 2 e/MMBtu. \n\n\n"}, {"section_title": "Limitations, Uncertainty, and Knowledge Gaps", "text": "ICF allocated the change in acres by region based on the ARMS corn acreage data by region (USDA ERS 2016) in order to apply region-specific fertilizer and insecticide application rates. This methodology assumes that the increased demand for corn ethanol affects all regions equally. To model the energy associated with tillage and chemical application, ICF used a dataset that is specific to Tennessee, however recognizes that other datasets, such as the ARMS data, could be used. The University of Tennessee dataset provides the necessary granularity in energy used by activity. ICF recognizes that crop budgets are based on recommendations. Finally, this analysis did not include the emissions impacts from the current use of nitrogen inhibitors and other advanced farming and agricultural practices. Potential emissions reductions from adoption of these practices are considered in the projection scenarios developed in Chapter 4.\nThe major variations in domestic LUC results between GTAP modeling years highlights the need for more study to determine if a stable trend or value emerges regarding emissions from LUC. Future research should continue to closely track annual corn acreage for ethanol production and the associated acreage conversions to generate a more certain assessment of the linkages between corn ethanol production and domestic LUC. Until these datasets, trends, and quantitative uncertainty assessments can be established, LUC will continue to be the most difficult life-cycle element to accurately analyze.\nThis analysis does not account for any additional yield changes over time in excess of those embedded in GTAP simulations. Increases in yield could have a large impact on the overall results. This GTAP analysis assumes that each country has a specific yield of bushels of corn per hectare. These direct assumptions are not publically available, however Keeney and Hertel (2009) does evaluate the percent change in yield following ethanol mandates for the United States and Rest of World (Keeney and Hertel, 2009). These results are not in enough granularity to support a robust analysis. When projecting the land-use emissions, a change in yield could be considered given the historical increases in yield that have been seen domestically. \nThe international rice methane analysis had similar constraints to the domestic rice assessment: while updated datasets existed from the previous RFS2 RIA assessment, these data were limited for both acreage and emission factors. As noted in the literature review, regional updates to emission factors have only just recently been developed for a small set of rice-producing countries. Future research should utilize these new emission factors as more become available. Acreage projection data available for this assessment was limited to only a few data points, and future efforts should develop countryspecific control and reference acreage data that consistently reflects historical trends."}, {"section_title": "References: Domestic Farm Inputs and Fertilizer N 2 O", "text": "Adams, D., Alig, R., McCarl, B.

This model uses a number of factors including population and GDP growth; production and consumption trends; existing trade patterns; and both international and domestic prices to determine the change in acres across 20 crops and 54 countries. The model, however, cannot distinguish what types of land will be affected by a given shock to the global agricultural system. Since 2010, Tahierpour and Tyner (2013) published a GTAP modelling scenario that reflects an increase in corn ethanol production from its 2004 level (3.41 billion gallons) to 15 billion gallons with GTAP recalibrated land-transformation parameters. This modelling scenario includes updated landtransformation data to develop region-specific elasticities using two United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) land-cover datasets. It also reflects evidence from recent studies that the costs of converting forest to cropland are higher than had been assumed in prior land-use change studies. The complete set of GTAP region land-use change simulation results from Taheripour and Tyner (2013) are available in Argonne National Laboratory's CCLUB model . These results are also shown in Table 3-40. Since 2010, a number of studies have evaluated the land-use change outcomes projected in the RIA (see Chapter 2). These studies generally conclude that there is not a strong link between corn ethanol production in the United States and deforestation in other countries, particularly in Brazil where much of the RIA's emissions related to indirect land use change were projected to occur. Additionally, among the broad range of emission estimates associated with indirect land-use change, across studies these estimates have decreased over time. For the land-use change that has been observed, Bruce Babcock and Zabid Iqbal's publication \"Using Recent Land Use Changes to Validate Land Use Change Models\" confirmed that the primary response from farmers across the world during the period 2004-2012 was to use available land resources more efficiently rather than to expand the amount of land in production. Farmers in Brazil, India, and China have increased double cropping, reduced unharvested planted area, reduced fallow land, and reduced temporary pasture which explains why the land-use changes projected in the RIA for Brazil and elsewhere have not materialized (Babcock and Iqbal, 2014). To develop an updated picture of regional land-use changes that have occurred since 2010 as a result of increases in corn ethanol production in the United States, ICF incorporated qualitative data from Babcock and Iqbal (2014) along with recent GTAP simulation results from . The acres adjustments relied on one source in order to be consistent across regions. ICF identified five regions for adjustments based on observed land practices and FAO data analysis. \uf06e Brazil: Babcock and Iqbal (2014) show that 76 percent of Brazil's change in acres was due to double cropped land. This analysis assumes that the 76 percent change can be applied the acreage within the GTAP output that was attributed to U.S. corn demand. \uf06e Sub-Saharan Africa: According to Babcock and Iqbal (2014), much of region's crop production was conducted by small-scale producers without modern farming equipment leading to the idea that double cropping is not widely adopted. The authors note that given domestic food demand from growing populations in the region, the extensive land-use increase equaled 20.7 million hectares or 1.35 percent (Babcock and Iqbal 2014). ICF adjusted the GTAP Sub-Saharan Africa region to allocate 1.35 percent of the GTAP 2013 change in acres to corn ethanol. \uf06e Indonesia: Babcock and Iqbal (2014) cite multiple studies that state that the land-use change in Indonesia attributed to corn production is most likely inflated due to the prevalence of double cropping and the significant expansion of palm oil production. They commented that a significant portion of the corn production increase is due to double cropping (Babcock and Iqbal 2014). ICF attributed 50 percent of the GTAP 2013 acres to those due to corn ethanol demands. The use of the ARB AEZ emission factors is consistent with the 19 regions and 18 zones reported by GTAP (CARB 2015) and maintains the 342 region-zone land conversion combinations while the use of the Winrock emission factors requires aggregation of AEZs within each region. Both data sets are displayed in ICF's literature review. ICF generated emissions factors by conversion and reversion type for each of the 19 GTAP regions by weighting each country's individual factors by the percent contribution to total arable land in each region. For ICF's literature review, the AEZ factors were averaged by GTAP region for the purpose of comparison. A comparison of these emission factors can be seen in Table 2-10, Table 2-11, and Table  2-12. Overall, there is not one methodology that consistently overestimates or underestimates emission factors when compared to the other alternatives. Deviations are specific to each country/region. As mentioned in the literature review, Winrock does have consistently lower emission factors associated with the Grassland to Annuals conversion while AEZ has lower emission factors for Cropland-Pasture to Annuals conversion."}, {"section_title": "References: International Land-Use Change", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ICF Methodology", "text": "The literature review found data available after 2010 that indicated both the trend in international rice acres and the associated CH 4 emissions are different from the projections in the RIA (see Table 2-39 and Table 2 -43). ICF used these acre and CH 4 emission data to determine new contributions of international rice methane to corn ethanol's life-cycle GHG emissions. However, similar to the domestic rice methane assessment, this analysis was again limited by a lack of data to construct scenarios distinguishing international rice acres for the corn only, control, and reference cases. Region specific methane emission factors were also unavailable. The methodology for assessing international rice methane emissions is similar to that used to assess emissions related to domestic rice methane emissions. That is, harvested acreage projections for the reference, control, and corn only cases are used to determine the country-specific changes in rice acres associated with the increase in U.S. corn ethanol production. The corn-only EPA 2017 FAPRI acreage projections isolate the RFS2 effects of corn ethanol. Country-specific annual rice methane emission factors were taken from the EPA's Foreign Agricultural Impact Calculations for Biofuel Lifecycle Analysis (EPA 2010). Table 3-53 shows the international acreage change (i.e., difference between control and reference cases acreage), emission factors, and total GHG emissions. Methane was converted to GHG emissions using the AR4 GWP coefficient. \nFuel and feedstock transportation represents a minimal portion of total corn ethanol life-cycle GHG emissions, contributing less than 5 percent (EPA, 2010a). However, transportation systems are dynamic and since 2010 have continually evolved to become more fuel and GHG efficient. Key developments that may have affected the GHG LCA profile of corn ethanol include: \uf06e Improved transportation technologies, such as improved fuel economies for medium and heavy duty (MDHD) diesel trucks (Cai et al., 2015).\nCorn-ethanol production has experienced considerable growth since 2010. From 2009-2014, U.S. fuel ethanol production increased by 40 percent, reaching over 14 billion gallons annually (EIA 2013, EIA 2015). There are currently 14 newly proposed and under-construction production plants, which will add over 850 million gallons per year to U.S. capacity (Ethanol Producer Magazine 2016). With this growth have come improved process efficiencies and new co-products. These process upgrades have become drivers for a decreasing GHG-intensity of corn ethanol production. Production yields, measured in gallons of ethanol per bushel of corn, increased by 5 percent between 2006 and 2014. New enzymes and yeast strains have increased process efficiencies in starch conversion and fermentation (EIA 2015). Along with distillers grains and solubles (DGS), corn oil is now recovered as a co-product, and 80 percent of dry grind mills are now capable of corn oil recovery (Argonne 2014). New state and federal programs, such as EPA's Efficient Producer Program and California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard, create incentives for innovative efforts that continue to lower corn ethanol production GHG emissions. The RIA used process-level data for energy use at corn ethanol production facilities. The data accounted for both dry and wet mill processes, where EPA modeled variations of primary energy (i.e., coal, natural gas, biomass) and electricity demands. The wet mill model did not include any electricity use. For the dry mill model, five process variations were modeled for both dry and wet DGS outputs (i.e., 10 total): \uf0b7 Base plant \uf0b7 Combined heat and power (CHP) \uf0b7 CHP with corn oil fractionation \uf0b7 CHP with fractionation and membrane separation \uf0b7 CHP with fractionation, membrane separation, and raw starch hydrolysis The study restricted wet milling variations to only three primary energy use variations (100 percent natural gas, 100 percent coal, 100 percent biomass). The final average plant results were based on a combination of dry milling with fractionation (63 percent) and wet milling (37 percent), where both processes used natural gas as the primary energy source. Our analysis uses more recent corn ethanol production data and emission factors available to estimate the current GHG intensity of production processes. The modeling utilizes the more recent GREET corn ethanol pathway updates (Argonne 2014), which use process-level data from Mueller and Kwik (2012). We maximize the available variations in GREET to mimic the scenarios modeled by EPA as closely as possible. These variations included (with primary energy source details): \uf0b7 Industry average-92 percent natural gas, 8 percent coal \uf0b7 Dry mill-100 percent natural gas \uf0b7 Dry mill-100 percent coal \uf0b7 Dry mill-100 percent biomass (forest residue) \uf0b7 Wet mill-72.5 percent natural gas, 27.5 percent coal Table 3-64 shows the assumptions and inputs for each of these scenarios. The industry average and wet milling processes are the only production pathways that include corn oil recovery. It should be noted that dry milling includes electricity consumption with the primary energy demands. ICF customized the allocation of co-products based on the methods available in GREET-using the displacement method for DGS and the marginal method for corn oil. The displacement method allocates all energy for DGS drying to the ethanol production process, and the benefits are assumed to displace animal feed (see the Domestic Farm Inputs and Fertilizer N 2 O section). The marginal method does not allocate the energy required for corn oil extraction to the ethanol process, but there are no benefits (i.e., displacement of other commodities reducing the ethanol carbon intensity, such as production of biodiesel) of corn oil production included in the assessment from any potential downstream use. Table 3-65 shows the results of the modeling for each of the scenarios described. The RIA emissions from fuel production results apply to a projected composite average corn ethanol refinery in 2022 (i.e., 63 percent dry mill, 37 percent wet mill). Our analysis also reflects a composite industry average refinery (18 percent dry milling without corn oil extraction, 71 percent dry milling with corn oil extraction, and 11 percent wet milling). Our resulting weighted industry average is 34,518 g CO 2 e/MMBtu. The higher level of emissions obtained in this analysis is mainly due to the use of current plant configurations that utilize a variety of thermal energy sources. The RIA analysis included only single thermal energy sources, and the natural gas result is shown in Table 3-63. Also, as the electricity grid mix continues to become cleaner with increased renewable resources, the production emissions will continue to decrease.   Our assessment relies heavily on the detailed modeling efforts of others, which are based on more recent available data and emission factors. A more detailed assessment would compile process-level data from existing corn ethanol production facilities to create a representative dataset of current operations. This bottom up approach in LCA could allow for modeling of more variations (e.g., CHP), particularly in efficiency improvements not captured in existing models such as GREET. The GREET model utilized in this study also does not allow for corn oil extraction applications to scenarios outside the industry average. This limited our ability to model the effects of different primary energy sources on that specific process. Wet milling modeling also does not allow for variations in primary energy sources through GREET. Future work could include developing a comprehensive database of energy demands, process emissions, ethanol yields, and co-product recovery for a wide range of corn ethanol plants to generate a stronger assessment of the GHG intensity of current production practices.\nThe RIA found tailpipe emissions to have an insignificant impact on total GHG emissions (less than 1 percent in all scenarios). All CO 2 emitted from corn ethanol combustion is considered biogenic and not accounted for in the carbon emissions. EPA used the 2009 MOVES model to estimate the GHG emissions from vehicle ethanol combustion. Since CO 2 emission from combustion are assumed to be biogenic, the assessment included only CH 4 and N 2 O emissions in the final value. Our assessment used the most recent and relevant values for E85 and ethanol tailpipe CH 4 and N 2 O emissions from the available literature. We selected E85 as the most relevant fuel available in the version of GREET used for comparison purposes with the EPA RIA study. Table 3-69 shows the literature results, as well as EPA emission factors. For the emission factors from the Washington Department of Ecology (2016), CH 4 and N 2 O were not separated from total GHG emissions in the available results. To determine the non-CO 2 emissions, we subtracted the GREET 2015 CO 2 E85 tailpipe emissions from these values. The EPA RIA and Washington Department of Ecology (2016) results reflect pure ethanol combustion, and the GREET and CA-GREET are results for E85 blends. There are large variations in the results, with the most recent results showing a declining trend in estimated emissions. Again, these results represent a minimal portion of the total overall life-cycle GHG emissions of corn ethanol. ICF uses the GREET 2015 emission values for our analysis."}, {"section_title": "References: International Rice Methane", "text": "EPA, 2010c.

The second projection, labeled the USDA Building-Blocks scenario, adds a number of changes refineries could make in their value chain to further reduce the GHG intensity of corn ethanol. These management changes include contracting with farmers to grow corn using specific GHG mitigation technologies and practices (reduced tillage, cover crops, and nitrogen management), switch to biomass as a process fuel, and locating confined livestock operations in close proximity to refineries.    USDA estimates that total U.S. harvested area will remain below RFS2 RIA assumed values until 2017 and will exceed the RIA 2022 corn harvested area by over 0.5 million acres. Based on these acreage projections, crop yields will increase from 169.2 bushels/acre in 2016 to 181.3 bushels/acre in 2022 (USDA ERS, 2016)."}, {"section_title": "Key Parameters and BAU and Building-Blocks Scenarios", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Methodology: ICF: 2022 Building-Blocks Scenario", "text": "The Building-Blocks scenario reflects the farm-level adoption of three conservation practice standards (CPSs) in the production of corn used to produce ethanol that USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRSC) have recognized as having GHG benefits.

Reduced tillage decreases soil disturbance during field operations and leaves a large proportion of plant residues on the field. Based on USDA's COMET-Planner report, this practice affects the soil carbon storage (see Domestic Land-Use Change section below) and nitrous oxide emissions from changes in the soil environment. It does not affect any changes in fertilizer application rates. To account for the adoption of reduced tillage in this analysis, ICF adjusted the fuel used for on-farm equipment and reduced the indirect N 2 O emissions associated with conventional tillage. Diesel fuel use is assumed to be 7.74 gallons per corn-acre under conventional tillage, based on 2015 farm budget worksheets published by the University of Tennessee (2015). To model reduced tillage, ICF reduced the fuel used for chisel and disk machinery in the conventional tillage case by 50 percent. Fuel use and related CO 2 emissions for all other equipment used in no-till systems remained the same as in conventional tillage systems (University of Tennessee, 2015). This resulted in a fuel consumption of 6.95 gallons per corn-acre. With respect to indirect N 2 O emissions, the shift from conventional to reduced tillage reduces the volatization rate of nitrogen fertilizer (Swan et al., n.d.) The COMET-Planner report attributes a 0.07 Mg CO 2 e/acre/year reduction in emissions due to reduced tillage relative to conventional tillage. This represents a 74.4 percent reduction in volatization N 2 O emissions (here measured in kg N 2 O/acre per kilogram of nitrogen applied)."}, {"section_title": "CPS 590-Nutrient Management: Improved Nitrogen Fertilizer Management", "text": "CPS 590 assumes the adoption of new nitrogen fertilizer management techniques including reduced application rates from targeted nitrogen fertilizer application management and the use of nitrification inhibitors. The COMET-Planner report estimates that CPS 590 practices can reduce nitrogen application rates by 15 percent. This percent adjustment was made to the application rates in the Building-Blocks scenario. Nitrification inhibitors are applied to reduce the leaching or production of N 2 O in the soil. The most common nitrification inhibitor used in the United States on corn acres is nitrapyrin. A report by the International Fertilizer Industry Association states that application rates of nitrapyrin range between 1.4-5.6 liters per hectare (Trenkel 2010). The assumed density is 1.582 grams/cm 3 (LookChem 2008). Based on these data, ICF assumed an application rate of 2.24 kg/acre. There are very few sources of publically available life-cycle assessment data with which to quantify the upstream emissions for nitrification inhibitors. For the upstream production emissions, ICF used \"Organophosphoruscompound\" from the ecoinvent database (Weidema et al. 2013) as a proxy for nitrapyrin. The emissions per kilogram of product are in line with those found in Dow's \"Using LCA to Identify Options for Greenhouse Gas Emission Reductions in Australian Wheat Farming\" (Helling et al. 2014)."}, {"section_title": "CPS 340-Cover Crops", "text": "Cover crops are planted in addition to seasonal crops to increase the nitrogen and water-use efficiencies. The additional crop residues increase soil carbon levels (Swan et al., n.d.) and can reduce the indirect emissions of nitrogen (e.g., N 2 O). The reductions of indirect N 2 O emissions are due to decreases in the leaching rate of nitrogen fertilizer (Swan et al., n.d.). The COMET-Planner report attributes a 0.05 Mg CO 2 e/acre/year reduction in emissions due to cover crops. This represents a 76.8 percent reduction in leaching N 2 O emissions (here measured in kg N 2 O/acre per kilogram of nitrogen applied).

Figure 4-1 shows the range of emissions from the ICF: 2014 Current Conditions on the far left to the ICF: 2022 Building-Blocks Scenario on the far right. The current conditions LCA represents current emissions, which are estimated at 21,814 g CO 2 e/MMBtu of ethanol. The 2022 BAU Scenario incorporates projected changes in corn yields between 2016 and 2022 from the 2016 USDA Baseline. These are estimated at 20,259 g CO 2 e/MMBtu. The ICF: 2022 Build-Blocks Scenario, estimated at 16,734 g CO 2 e/MMBtu, further accounts for the adoption by corn farmers of all three CPSs in 2022. The central three bars represent the three CPSs isolated from each other. The values presented in Figure 4-1 do not include the ethanol co-product credit from DGS displacing corn, soybean meal, and urea. To be consistent with the analysis in Chapter 3, ICF modified the GREET model inputs including corn yields, fertilizer application and nitrogen emission rates, and ethanol production technology (e.g., dry mill refining with corn oil extraction) to develop the unique co-product credit for each scenario. Both the BAU and the Building-Blocks scenarios were modified to incorporate corn farming farm inputs and fertilizer N 2 O. In the Building-Blocks scenario, the ethanol yield from corn for Dry Mill ethanol refineries with corn oil extraction was increased from 2.8 gallon/bushel to 2.95 gallon/bushel. Utilizing the AR4 GWPs for CH 4 and N 2 O, Table 4-3 shows the resulting DGS credit per MMBtu and the resulting total emissions impacts for the Domestic Farm Inputs and Fertilizer N 2 O emission category.

This assessment used the same emission factors and anticipated acreage changes as the ICF current conditions LCA. Acreage changes are based on the 2013 corn ethanol production scenario in the GREET model's Carbon Calculator for Land Use Change from Biofuels Production (CCLUB) . Using the 2013 production scenario assumes that total U.S. corn ethanol production will remain constant at 15 billion gallons annually through 2022 (11.59 billion gallons/year greater than 2004 production levels). The difference between the BAU scenario and Build-Blocks scenario is the continued adoption of conventional till in the BAU scenario and the adoption of reduced till in the Building-Blocks scenario.\nThe ICF current conditions LCA used default GREET 2015 transportation and distribution emission factors, mode allocations (i.e., barge, truck, or rail), and distance assumptions to generate final transportation related emissions estimates for current corn ethanol. For this analysis the default GREET 2015 emissions are modified as follows: \uf0b7 ICF: 2022 BAU Scenario-incorporates increased trucking fuel economy and substitution of liquid natural gas (LNG) for diesel fuel heavy duty trucks; and \uf0b7 ICF: 2022 Building-Blocks Scenario-incorporates the BAU scenario modifications with eliminating emissions related to transporting dried distillers grains (DDGS) (assumes location of a Confined Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO) in close proximity to the ethanol plant). The analysis started with the GREET 2015 emission factors for LNG and renewable liquified natural gas (RLNG) used in transportation by trucks. The improved trucking fuel economy was assumed to be a 50 percent increase from the default GREET assumptions, where the baseline was 5.3 and 10.4 miles per diesel gallon for heavy heavy-duty diesel trucks (HHDDT) and medium heavy-duty diesel trucks (MHDDT), respectively. Table 4-7 shows the effects of these variations on emission factors for fuel and feedstock transportation segments. GREET assumes that MHDDTs are used for farm to stacks transport, and HHDDTs are used in all other segments. Our analysis also included these fuel economy and new fuel variations in our assessment of corn oil transportation. Fuel types and fuel economies for rail and barge remained the same as in the ICF current conditions LCA. Transportation distances and mode allocations, outside of the removed DDGS transportation for the Building-Blocks scenario, were unchanged as well (see Chapter 3, Table 3-59)."}, {"section_title": "Domestic Land-Use Change Results", "text": "Table 4-4 shows the total GHG emission results for conventional (ICF: 2022 BAU Scenario) and reduced till (ICF: 2022 Build-Blocks Scenario) for 100 cm soil depths. facilities and grew in number by 90 percent from 2000-2013.

Table 4-5 and Table 4-6 show the results of our analysis for the two emission reduction scenarios. Table  4-6 also details other scenarios based on variations in production yield, fuel mix, and process type (with or without corn oil extraction). Figure 4-2 depicts these same results. For both the BAU and the Building-Blocks scenarios, ICF assumed Dry Mill with corn extraction based on the expectation that by 2022 all Dry Mill ethanol plants will have corn oil extraction. For the BAU scenario, the more conservative natural gas fuel case was selected and for the Building-Blocks scenario, the more optimistic biomass fuel case with increase ethanol yield was selected.

The ICF: 2022 BAU and ICF: 2022 Building-Blocks Scenarios can be viewed as projections of the GHG emissions associated with corn ethanol production in 2022 given, respectively, a relatively passive and a relative aggressive effort to decrease corn ethanol's GHG footprint. While it is unlikely that all of the emission reductions estimated for the ICF: 2022 Building-Blocks Scenario would be achieved by 2022, the scenario does provide a lower bound for describing the potential reduced GHG emissions associated with ethanol, at least over the timeframe of the RFS2."}, {"section_title": "blank page", "text": ""}]
