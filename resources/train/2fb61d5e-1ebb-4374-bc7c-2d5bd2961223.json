A current plausible model for the development of AD suggests a temporal order of pathological brain changes; amyloid deposition occurs early in the disease, but may not directly cause clinical symptoms and is believed to trigger neuronal injury and loss [1, 2] . Neuronal and synaptic losses are key determinants of cognitive impairment, which are accompanied by brain atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [3, 4] . Thus, the pathological cascade in AD is regarded as a two-stage, slowly progressive process in which amyloidosis and neuronal injury (tauopathy and neurodegeneration) are largely sequential rather than simultaneous processes [1, 2] .\nThe predementia phase of AD is characterized clinically by MCI [5] , and this is accompanied by biochemical changes in the brain reflected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [6, 7] as well as in brain morphology on MRI [8, 9] . Specifically, impairments in delayed free-recall measures from episodic memory tasks [10] [11] [12] , reduced hippocampal volumes [12] [13] [14] [15] , decreased CSF levels of amyloidbeta (A\u03b242; a marker of amyloid mismetabolism), and elevations in tau and phosphorylated tau (p-Tau) protein (markers of axonal damage and neurofibrillary tangles) [6, 14, [16] [17] [18] [19] are the best established predictive biomarkers of AD dementia in patients with MCI [20] .\nWhen analyzing the relation between these biomarkers and progression to AD dementia or cognitive decline in MCI patients, most previous studies have either determined the strength of association between biomarkers at baseline and cognitive/functional decline at follow-up (continuous variables), or how well biomarker levels at baseline were able to predict a diagnosis of AD dementia at follow-up (dichotomous variable). The differential predictive power of different biomarkers or combinations of biomarkers was mainly evaluated descriptively, not by statistical testing.\nA wealth of data exists to show that the brain changes on MRI are related to CSF biomarkers, but also reveal complementary information [11, 21, 22] . When combining two or more biomarkers simultaneously for prediction of AD dementia from MCI, i.e., using MRI and CSF [23, 24] , MRI and cognitive testing [25, 26] , fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and CSF [27] , FDG-PET and cognitive testing [28] , and MRI, CSF, and FDG-PET [29, 30] , the utility of multiple biomarker combinations for prediction of AD dementia from MCI was confirmed. In particular, a recent study with an advanced multimodal classification method revealed that 91.5% of MCI short-term progressors and 73.4% MCI nonprogressors were correctly classified using baseline MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF data [30] . Combining cognitive measures with CSF or volumetric MRI may substantially improve risk prediction. However, increasing the number of biomarker combinations did not lead to an incremental increase in predictive power. A combination of impaired learning ability with medial temporal atrophy was associated with the greatest risk of developing AD dementia from MCI [31] .\nA prediction of AD dementia in a foreseeable time period, i.e., within 1 or 2 years, appears much more relevant in a clinical perspective than a prediction of dementia in the more distant future, e.g., in 10-20 years. Individuals classified to be at \"short-term risk\" can receive more active treatment and counselling. Furthermore, the proportion of MCI patients progressing to AD dementia is not constant over time, but is highest during the first years of follow-up and decreases at longer follow-up intervals [32] . Finally, information about long-term risk of AD dementia may be of limited practical value for patients at the end of their lifespan. In subjects with MCI, the effects of cerebral amyloidosis and hippocampal atrophy on the progression to AD dementia differ, e.g., the risk profile is linear with hippocampal atrophy but reaches a ceiling with higher values for cerebral amyloidosis [1] . In subsequent investigations, biomarkers of neuronal injury appeared to best predict AD dementia from MCI subjects at shorter time intervals (1-2 years) in particular [14, 18] .\nIn the present study, we investigated which combination of cognitive markers and biomarkers can best predict progression to AD dementia in order to generate a clinical model to predict the short-term progression to AD dementia applicable to a help-seeking sample of MCI patients. Knowledge on the added value of combining different biomarker modalities for the most efficient prediction of progression to AD dementia in MCI subjects is still limited. In our analysis, we describe the incremental predictive power of an increasing number of combined biomarkers to determine progression to AD dementia from MCI subjects and test the best two-to fourpredictor combinations for superiority over each other."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Dementia Competence Network study", "text": "The diagnostic and prognostic study of the Dementia Competence Network (DCN) is a prospective multisite longitudinal observational study on memory clinic patients with MCI or early dementia [33] .

The DCN study was approved by the Ethics Review Board of the Erlangen medical faculty (coordinating center) and by the Ethics Committees at each individual center, and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients gave written informed consent to participate. We adhered to the Standards for Reporting Diagnostic accuracy (STARD) statement [35] to optimize generalizability of the prediction model."}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Subjects were recruited between May 2003 and November 2007. They were referred to the participating specialist memory clinics for the workup of memory complaints and/or other cognitive deficits. In most centers, a consecutive series of patients was included. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria were published earlier [33] . For the present analysis, all patients had MCI at baseline.\nA diagnosis of MCI was made on the basis of clinical and neuropsychological data, without reference to CSF or MRI volumetry results (see below). The DCN study deliberately used a broad definition of MCI [5] -complaints of a cognitive deficit and objectified decline of cognitive abilities (more than 1 SD below age-and education-adjusted norms) in at least one of the following domains as evidenced by standardized neuropsychological tests (Consortium to Establish a Registry of Dementia (CERAD) neuropsychological test battery): verbal learning and memory, nonverbal learning and memory, word fluency, naming, visuoconstruction, cognitive speed, or executive function [36] ; no or only minor changes in complex activities of daily living (ADL), as demonstrated by a Bayer activities of daily living (B-ADL) score < 4 [37] ; no major depressive episode at baseline as demonstrated by a Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score < 13 [38] .\nWith this diagnostic procedure, 1071 MCI patients were included at baseline from which we selected a subsample of 115 (12%) patients according to the following inclusion/exclusion criteria: availability of 1) complete baseline neuropsychological data; (2) adequately processed and quality checked MR imaging; and (3) CSF data at baseline; (4) all had been followed for at least 12 months (mean follow-up 25.46 months) and were clinically evaluated every 12 months up to 36 months or until progression to incident dementia; and 5) outcome-MCI stable or progression to AD only. The major focus of our research was on early prediction of AD from normal. Since our diagnoses are based on clinical classification at follow-up and are not pathological diagnoses, an inclusion of subjects with progression to other dementia diagnoses may lead to misclassification. This potential misclassification would decrease the predictive power of the biomarkers to be analyzed. Stable MCI patients were defined as those with no dementia (Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) < 1), a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 24 or higher at last follow-up visit, and a B-ADL score < 4 at each follow-up.\nDementia was defined as a clinical diagnosis with cognitive impairment in two or more cognitive domains severe enough to interfere with normal functioning in the community. From a detailed medical history, clinical, neurological, and psychiatric investigation, other reasons for an impaired cognitive performance and performance in ADL were excluded. At follow-up, progression to dementia was defined as newly occurring impairments in instrumental or basic activities of daily living (B-ADL score > 4) in subjects previously defined as having MCI. Patients who developed a non-AD dementia at follow-up were excluded from the analyses."}, {"section_title": "Neuropsychological procedures", "text": "All subjects were investigated with standardized diagnostic procedures.

After a distraction period of 15 min, while other neuropsychological tests were done, subjects have to recall the items presented and then to recognize them among distractors. We here focused on the delayed free-recall (CERAD-DR) measure. As a composite measure of overall dementia severity, the CDR sumof-boxes (CDR-sb) was applied [39] . For comparison to other cohorts, the MMSE was applied [40] .\nCollecting, storage, and shipment of the samples Before starting collection of human body fluid samples, standard operating procedures (SOPs) were implemented [41] . Briefly, CSF was collected by lumbar puncture from the L3/L4 or L4/L5 intervertebral region. No serious adverse events were reported. CSF was sampled in polypropylene test tubes with intermediate storage at site (-80\u00b0C), and was then shipped on dry ice to the central biobank (Erlangen University) without undergoing any thawing/refreezing cycles."}, {"section_title": "Analyses of CSF biomarkers", "text": "The following CSF biomarkers were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA): amyloidbeta 1-40 (A\u03b240; The Genetics Co., Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland), A\u03b242, total tau (t-Tau), and phosphorylated tau 181 (p-Tau; Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium). The analyses were performed by experienced laboratory technicians in a certified laboratory and under a routine quality control regime (intra-assay coefficients of variation: 2.3-5.9%; interassay coefficients of variation: 9.8-13.7%). The technicians were blinded to the clinical diagnoses and other clinical information. In addition to A\u03b242, several other A\u03b2 isoforms are excreted into the CSF, the most abundant being A\u03b240 [42] . CSF A\u03b240 is relatively unchanged in AD, but the CSF A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio (A\u03b2 ratio) has been suggested to have stronger diagnostic accuracy for AD compared to CSF A\u03b242 alone [43] . The ratio may normalize individuals according to their A\u03b2 production level, so that pathologically low CSF A\u03b242 can be identified in \"high A\u03b2 producers\" and vice versa [44] . Since it has been shown that the A\u03b2 ratio is useful in a clinical setting [45] , we also evaluated the predictive value of this ratio."}, {"section_title": "Hippocampal volume", "text": "MRI scans were obtained on 1.5-Tesla scanners.

Furthermore, a single volunteer was investigated at each of these centers. Hippocampal volume (HCV) was calculated as the mean value of the left and right hemisphere, and was determined from high-resolution structural magnetic resonance images using the Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain (FMRIB) Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool [47] from the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) package of tools [48] , since a biological relevance for using the hippocampal volumes of the left and right hemispheres separately cannot be assumed.\nEstimated total intracranial volume was calculated through registration of each MRI scan to a standard brain image template [49] using FSL FLIRT [50] .

In the context of this study, percentage abnormal values in relation to these cut-offs were used for descriptive purposes only. A\u03b242 (600 pg/ml), p-Tau (60 pg/ ml), and total tau (300 pg/ml) cut-offs were provided by the assay producer (Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium).

A correction for multiple testing was not performed due to the low number of tests. Group comparisons at baseline were performed by the Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous and nominal variables. CSF biomarkers, hippocampal volumes, and neuropsychological data as well as demographic data obtained in MCI patients at baseline were used to predict progression to AD dementia (MCI-AD) versus nonprogression (MCI-stable). We did not control for possible center effects, MCI subtype, or length of follow-up. The predictive power of each single parameter was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) analysis. Sensitivity, specificity, and Youden's index (sensitivity + specificity -1) [54] of the various predictors/ prediction models were also calculated to provide a complete description of the prediction parameters.\nFor comparison of the AUC values of single predictors we used a bootstrapping algorithm as implemented in the pROC R-package (Version 1.8) [55] . The predictive accuracy of all possible combinations of two, three, and four parameters was analyzed by a classification system that consisted of a 0.632 bootstrapping wrapper (100 replications) around a support vector machine (SVM) with linear kernel. Whether the addition of a variable significantly increased predictive quality of models with one, two, three, or four predictors was tested by comparing the AUC distributions of 1000 bootstrapping replications for the different classifiers according to Hanley and McNeil [56] . In each bootstrap trial, the different models were ranked according to the AUC. For statistical testing, we calculated a Z-score which approximately follows a standard normal distribution.\nThe p value was then calculated according to the standard normal distribution. To demonstrate the normality of the Z values, a QQ Norm plot was calculated.\nAs a second way to compare the ROC curves, we evaluated the ROC curves at a given sensitivity of 85%. This is consistent with international recommendations for a biomarker, since values above 80% are considered indicative of satisfactory predictive performance [57] . Using 100 bootstrapping replications, we obtained a distribution of specificities around a given sensitivity of 85%. To compare the ROC curves at the given sensitivity, we used the same procedure as described above to compare the AUCs."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "We analyzed 115 patients with complete datasets at baseline and clinical follow-up.

Due to various missing data, 956 subjects could not be analyzed (see Fig. 1 for exact patient loss). Table 1 compares the demographic characteristics, cognitive and psychometric test scores, hippocampal volume measures, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers at baseline between the maximal MCI sample, in those for which the respective measures were available, and the final analysis set (115 patients, 12% of the MCI cohort) which was used for predictor analysis. There was no significant difference between the groups on any parameter (with the exception of CDR-sb which was not clinically relevant). All p values were based on pairwise comparisons, uncorrected for multiple testing. Table 2 summarizes the demographic characteristics, cognitive test scores, hippocampal volume measures and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers at baseline and follow-up for the groups used for the prediction analysis (final analysis set, MCI-AD, MCI-stable) and the statistical differences between the MCI-AD and MCIstable groups.

Classification results for prediction of progression from MCI to AD dementia (MCI-AD) of the best one-to four-parameter predictor combinations are given in Table 3 . t-Tau was the single marker with the highest mean bootstrap-based cross-validated AUC of 0.77, followed by HCV (AUC = 0.74). Compatible with this, the best two-predictor combination was t-Tau and HCV (AUC = 0.81). The addition of a third and fourth predictor only minimally increased the mean bootstrappingbased cross-validated AUC (the best three-predictor combination was t-Tau/HCV/CDR-sb, AUC = 0.83; the best four-parameter combination was t-Tau/HCV/CDR-sb/A\u03b2 ratio, AUC = 0.82). The pairwise comparisons of AUC values for HCV or t-Tau with the best two-, three-or four- predictor combinations were not significantly different. The AUC-curves for the best one to four predictor(s) combinations are illustrated in Fig. 2 .

A combination of two biomarkers of neurodegeneration (e.g., HCV and t-Tau) did not predict AD dementia in MCI significantly better than any parameter alone, and none of the possible three-to four-parameter combinations improved the predictive power. Our study is unique in applying advanced statistical methods for testing different biomarker combinations for superiority over each other. A systematic incremental combination of the nine independent predictor variables in models with maximally four predictors allowed for the direct comparison of single predictor models with more complex models, based upon a bootstrapping algorithm for the AUC. There was a numerical gain by up to 6% in AUC from the best single-predictor model to the best four-predictor model, but none of the differences between one-predictor models and the best two-predictor model were statistically significant. Only when specificities were compared for a given sensitivity of 85% was there an inferiority of hippocampal volume to the best two-to four-parameter combinations. Although it is possible that a test of these models in a larger sample or a combination of even more predictors may lead to a generally superior multipredictor model, the current results support the assumption that an easy to use and economic one-predictor model of neurodegeneration markers may be as good as more complex models for the prediction of progression from MCI to AD dementia within a relatively short time interval of 2 years. Indeed, due to typically high collinearity of predictor variables, more complex models are not likely to increase prediction accuracy [58] . Our cohort of MCI patients is generated from a large multicenter study of German university memory clinics in patients with various degrees of cognitive impairment ranging from subjective cognitive decline to various forms of dementia which differs, for example, from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort in terms of setting and recruitment [33] . A selection bias of the final analysis set of moderate sample size from the much larger total MCI cohort could not be demonstrated in our data. MCI participants in ADNI were carefully selected to include individuals with documented memory impairment and to exclude those whose impairment could arise from other potential causes. Thus, the ADNI MCI population is not representative of a general clinical population, but more of a research population. In our sample, the inclusion and exclusion criteria were more liberal [33] as the patients were recruited from a help-seeking clinical sample. Also, the neuropsychological criteria to diagnose MCI used a more liberal threshold to define cognitive impairment, following the criteria proposed by Winblad et al. [5] . The mean age of our sample (66 years) was considerably younger than in ADNI (74 years) [59] , and in the DESCRIPA study (71 years) [60] . This may impact on the proportion of subjects progressing to AD dementia at the given follow-up rate. Clinically, 24.3% of the MCI patients of the DCN cohort progressed to AD dementia after a mean follow-up period of 25.5 months, corresponding to an annualized conversion rate of 12%. This rate is lower than an approximate 30% progression rate in other multicenter cohorts with comparable follow-up (32% DESCRIPA [60, 61] , 30-44% ADNI [24, 31, 59] , and 30% AIBL [62] ). After a mean follow-up period of 3.3 years, 44.6% of MCI subjects from ADNI had progressed to AD dementia [59] , in line with the notion that the likelihood of progression to AD dementia increases with follow-up time. In summary, the lower progression rate may be attributed to the lower mean age, a broader definition of MCI, and differences in recruitment strategy of patients in our sample compared to other cohorts with similar follow-up time [62] [63] [64] .\nAs in other studies, the groups of MCI-stable and MCI-AD were not different with respect to age, education, gender, APO E genotype, and A\u03b240, and all baseline Alzheimer biomarker levels were pathologically changed in MCI-AD compared to MCI-stable. With respect to their predictive power, a shorter follow-up time generally favors biomarkers of neurodegeneration, e.g., tau and HCV, since neurodegeneration occurs shortly before (or even triggers) progression from MCI to dementia stage. In univariate analyses, the biomarkers t-Tau and HCV and the cognitive markers CDR-sb, CERAD-DR, and MMSE fairly well predicted progression to AD dementia, while p-TAU, A\u03b242, and A\u03b240 only poorly predicted progression. APO E genotype did not have any predictive value. None of the single predictors reached the criterion of an AUC > 0.8 for a diagnostic biomarker, suggested by a Consensus report [57] . Almost all of the two-to four-predictor combinations increased the predictive power over the threshold AUC > 0.8, but none of the three-and four-predictor combinations were significantly superior to the two-predictor combination of the injury markers HCV and t-Tau. Similar to our data, data from ADNI showed that a combination of a measure of volumetric change and t-Tau in CSF was associated with higher risk of progression to AD dementia from MCI compared with each marker alone [24] . In the European multicentre DESCRIPA study, these injury markers predicted time to dementia in subjects with MCI and proven amyloid pathology [65] .\nDiagnostic biomarkers for the cross-sectional diagnosis of AD dementia compared to controls should have a sensitivity and specificity above 80% [57] . Our best twoand three-predictor combinations were both above this Fig. 3 Boxplot of specificities at a given sensitivity of 85% for the different predictor combinations. AUC were calculated by 100 replications of a .632 bootstrapping algorithm. p-values for comparing specificities at the given sensitivity demonstrated the single value predictors HCV and total tau were significantly inferior compared to the two-four predictor combinations. None of the predictor combinations were significantly different from each other.

This relative lack of specificity may mainly be due to two reasons: 1) despite extensive inclusion and exclusion criteria, there will be some heterogeneity of underlying disease in MCI patients; 2) at a mean follow-up interval of approximately 2 years (maximum 3 years), some patients classified as MCIstable will not yet have progressed to AD dementia. This hypothesis is consistent with findings of a meta-analysis showing a trend towards increasingly higher effect sizes of CSF biomarkers including t-Tau, p-Tau and A\u03b242 during longer clinical follow-up [66] . In conclusion, the distinction of clinical entities (healthy versus diseased) differs between a short-term prediction of progression to AD dementia as compared to a cross-sectional diagnosis of AD dementia.\nThree aspects of the data on individual predictors deserve comment. Firstly our data are based on a variable length of follow-up (1-3 years) which optimizes the available study information. A homogeneous follow-up of, for example, 1 year resulted in lower predictive values due to a reduced number of subjects progressing to AD dementia (21 instead of 28 patients). Hippocampal volume and total tau remained the best single predictors and two-parameter combinations. Furthermore, the order of the best three-predictor combination also remained unchanged (data not shown). Thus, any restriction to a homogenous short follow-up time will underestimate the predictive power of all parameters. Scientifically, a followup time until death of study participants would be desirable, but this would be accompanied by considerable drop-out due to various age-and disease-associated reasons. From a clinical standpoint, a follow-up time of 2-3 years may be an acceptable compromise to inform patients with MCI about their foreseeable future, rather than a follow-up time of, for example, 10 years or more, because their life expectancy may be limited. Also, the inclusion of 17 non-AD converters into the MCI-stable group did not impact our analysis. This suggests that our model could apply to unselected MCI subjects, although the large drop-out rate due to loss to follow-up and missing biomarker information limits the generalizability. Secondly, with respect to CSF analyses, it has been argued that a lumbar puncture (LP) for CSF protein analysis may be too invasive for routine use in patients with dementia or MCI. Although there are some contraindications to LP, several studies have shown negligible frequency of complications, especially in the elderly. This supports a routine analysis of CSF biomarkers as part of the clinical diagnostic workup of patients with cognitive impairment possibly due to AD [67] . Thirdly, A\u03b242 in CSF was abnormal in just 34% of the total MCI sample. In the MCI-AD subgroup, which consisted largely of patients with amnestic MCI (26/28 patients), roughly two-thirds of the patients had abnormal A\u03b242 values. The remaining third of patients would have to be classified as suspected non-AD pathophysiology (SNAP), at a frequency roughly consistent with a previous review [68] . Again, our sample of patients is more representative of a general help-seeking memory clinic population, and a greater heterogeneity of underlying disease in MCI patients is to be expected as compared to a research population. Also, A\u03b242 in CSF was the individual parameter least predictive for progression to AD dementia. In a previous publication on MCI patients from the DCN [69] , episodic memory measures were highly significantly related to a CSF AD+ signature (Hulstead score, which includes measures of A\u03b242 and t-Tau [70] ). This suggests that our sample does contain an enriched sample of patients with incipient Alzheimer pathology.\nHowever, at the short follow-up interval of approximately 2 years (maximum 3 years), some patients classified as MCI-stable will not yet have progressed to AD dementia and biomarkers of neurodegeneration will be favored over biomarkers of amyloid pathology in predicting progression to AD dementia. This assumption is supported by the poorer specificity of A\u03b242 compared to t-Tau (0.64 versus 0.86), which reflects a lower ratio of negative cases (i.e., such MCI subjects that will remain stable over a much longer observation period), whereas the sensitivity (a ratio of such MCI cases that characterize with pathological biomarkers and have already progressed to dementia) of A\u03b242 is superior to t-Tau (0.74 versus 0.62) and slightly superior to hippocampal volume (0.71). Comparable data were obtained by Davatzikos et al. [71] in a subset of patients for whom both CSF and spatial patterns of brain atrophy AD score (SPARE-AD) values were available. However, some further analyses of ADNI data with longer follow-up [59] and DESCRIPA data [61] are in disagreement with the relative superiority of CSF t-Tau over CSF A\u03b242 in predictor combinations. It had been suggested that the ratio of A\u03b242/A\u03b240 may improve the validity of the CSF amyloid AD biomarker for diagnosis [43, 44] . In our dataset, however, the A\u03b242/A\u03b240 ratio was not consistently superior to A\u03b242 alone for predicting AD dementia in MCI patients.\nIn several analyses using diverse subgroups of MCI patients from the ADNI cohort, several combinations of different biomarkers were tested to predict future cognitive decline or progression to AD dementia; different measures of cortical atrophy including hippocampal volume and, less significantly, the tau/A\u03b2-42 ratio, predicted cognitive decline in MCI [29] . Landau et al. [11] found that several biomarkers predicted cognitive decline in univariate models, but only reduced glucose metabolism and episodic memory predicted progression to AD. Ewers et al. [59] in their comparison of the effectiveness of single variables and multiple variables in predicting the conversion of MCI to AD found that the best single predictors were comparable in accuracy with the best multiple predictor models, which included right hippocampal volume, CSF p-Tau/A\u03b242, TMT-B, and age. Davatzikos et al. [71] reported that the best combination of biomarkers for predicting AD dementia from MCI was a combination of SPARE-AD score, summarizing brain atrophy patterns, with CSF total tau. Gomar et al. [12] found that their most predictive model included two measures of episodic memory and one MR volume measure. An approach using the weighted fusion of data from both high-and low-dimensional modalities [72] found that MCI to AD conversion was optimally predicted by a combination of FDG-PET, MRI shape information, and CSF biomarkers, although CSF biomarkers added only minor improvement. By integrating multimodal data in a probabilistic manner, Young et al. [73] predicted conversion of MCI to AD over 3 years with an accuracy of 72.2%. Heister et al. [31] stratified the ADNI MCI cohort by degree of MR atrophy, CSF biomarker levels, or the degree of learning impairment, and assessed the contribution of each factor to the MCI to AD conversion. Learning impairment plus MR atrophy were associated with the highest risk (HR = 29.0) for conversion. A lack of sensitivity of A\u03b242 for prediction was noted. Trzepacz et al. [74] analyzed 29 numeric neuroimaging variables for their performance for predicting conversion from MCI to AD dementia at 2 years. MRI measures had the highest predictive accuracy (67%) which increased (76%) when combined with PIB-PET, producing the highest accuracy among any biomarker combination. For the DESCRIPA cohort, a multicenter European cohort with a 5-year follow-up period, it has been shown that in subjects with MCI and evidence of amyloid pathology, the injury markers CSF t-Tau, p-Tau, and hippocampal atrophy can best predict cognitive decline [60] . Similarly, earlier studies with smaller sample sizes have shown that a combination of hippocampal volume on MRI and CSF-based biomarkers may increase prediction accuracy [23, 75] ."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "The present study has some limitations. Firstly, only patients who were subjected to a CSF analysis at baseline and were able to undergo MRI and who returned for clinical follow-up were analyzed. However, a sampling bias in our final analysis set could not be demonstrated. Secondly, the variability of CSF biomarker levels between laboratories [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] makes it difficult to introduce generally applicable cut-off values. To minimize variability we had installed SOPs for pre-analytical sample handling prior to the initiation of the study [41] and analyzed the CSF samples in one centre only. Thirdly, and as in most other predictive studies, patient classification relied on a clinical diagnosis which is not always accurate, especially at early stages of the disease. None of the cases investigated here was neuropathologically verified. This was one of the reasons for excluding patients from our analyses who progressed to other forms of dementia. Fourthly, our study was performed in a memory clinic setting with a tertiary referral structure and therefore should be replicated in other more general settings. This might lead to datasets with a number of incomplete cases. However, the advanced diagnostic procedures (MRI and LP) will be restricted to specialist centers and motivated patients (typical for tertiary referral samples or a memory clinic population) if ever implemented into clinical practice. This may facilitate the generation of complete datasets as used in our study. Furthermore, our statistical methods require complete datasets to allow group comparisons by bootstrapping algorithms. Finally, we applied a relatively short followup period with a mean of 2 years, meaning that a certain proportion of patients who were classified as stable are likely to progress to dementia later on. This may explain the low positive predictive value, a value which had not been explicitly referred to before. However, the successful short-term prediction is also a particular strength of the study (see above).\nThere are several other strengths of the study presented here. It is a large prospective multicentre study investigating the predictive properties of core dementia biomarkers with uniform protocols across centers and with prior installation of SOPs, including the use of appropriate CSF sample tubes and overall standardized pre-analytical CSF handling. The patients were phenotyped and followed-up in expert university memory clinics, which increases the quality of the diagnostic workup. We adhered to the STARD recommendations. All these measures should optimize the generalizability of the results."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Our results show that a combination of two biomarkers of neurodegeneration (e.g., HCV and t-Tau) is not superior over the single parameters alone in identifying patients with MCI who are most likely to progress to AD dementia within a relatively short time period. However, there is a gradual increase in the statistical measures across increasing biomarker combinations (always involving t-Tau and HCV as the best parameters). From our data it is not possible to deduct recommendations on how to optimize the predictive diagnosis in individual patients with MCI in clinical practice. For enrichment strategies of MCI patients progressing to AD dementia for clinical trials, a combination of two neurodegeneration parameters (HCV and t-Tau) in addition to clinical measures such as CDR-sb may maximize progression rates in order to minimize false negative results of intervention studies."}]
