[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "When COVID-19 ravaged the Wuhan district in China in early January 2020, no one knew about the nature of COVID-19. In retrospective analysis, it revealed that infection actually started a few weeks earlier and rapidly spread around the area of Wuhan's animal market. In fact, people in Wuhan, including temporary workers who were busy with New\nYear shopping, were planning to go home to celebrate the Chinese New Year. Unfortunately, these holiday activities greatly facilitated the spread of COVID-19. Suddenly, thousands of people contracted the novel coronavirus, and patients were rushed to the local hospitals.\nUnfortunately, with inadequate knowledge of the coronavirus, limited intensive care units (ICU) and inadequate equipment, many medical staff were also infected and succumbed to this devastating coronavirus epidemic. On January 10, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention shared the complete gene sequence of the virus with the World Health Organization and other countries (China-CDC, 2020). On January 29, Chinese scientists reported the complete genome sequences of COVID-19 . This timely report allowed the scientific community worldwide to gain a better understanding of the virus and provided clues for medication and vaccine development. This early phase of the epidemic infection in China was later viewed as the most contagious period, because patients were placed everywhere in the emergency room and no adequate protection equipment was afforded even for medical staff.\nOne week later, the government locked down Wuhan City and entire country of China faced its darkest moments, which lasted 75 days. Surprisingly, two month later, this sad phenomenon repeated in other parts of the world, including Italy, Spain, and recently in the United States and\nBrazil. Obviously, the Wuhan experience was not taken seriously in countries outside of China.\nOn January 30, 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. As predicted, it quickly turned into a world pandemic, with over 25 million confirmed cases and almost 900,000 deaths, with unknown dark figures and the number is still increasing (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). Several western drugs, such as remdesivir and\nhydroxychloroquine with high expectations were tested in the early stage in China. However, hydroxychloroquine is highly controversial. Recent clinical trials showed that hydroxychloroquine was ineffective (Geleris et al., 2020) . On the other hand, remdesevir significantly reduced the mortality of COVID-19 patients in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial with 1063 patients (Beigel et al., 2020) . The later clinical Phase 3 SIMPLE trial reported a 62% reduction in mortality in COVIS-19 patients. One early limitation of remdesivir involved its use in severely ill hospitalized patients to broaden its availability, an inhalable remdesivir medication is currently being developed for earlier stage patients. Nevertheless, vaccine developments remain to be the only hope to save people's lives during this pandemic infection. At present, a total of 18 vaccine projects are running. In the past, the fastest vaccination programs took at least four years. The current hopes and promises estimate that it might take 6 months to one year to complete the clinical evaluation of new vaccines, before they could become available to the public. This promise still has to be fulfilled quickly to meet the demands.\nTherefore, it is necessary to pay attention to TCM medications, which are immediately available. In fact, TCM formulae were successfully used to fight COVID-19 in Wuhan and to provide the scientific communities with a reliable summary report for following up research and refining TCM preparations with scientific methods. Evidence-based TCM treatments have the potential not only to treat COVID-19, but also to prevent an outbreak of another new coronavirus in the future.\nPatients admitted to the local hospitals in Wuhan were primarily treated with western medicine as frontline treatment, except in a few TCM hospitals, where patients were treated directly with TCM. According to several recent reports that patients received TCM treatment directly showed >90% efficacy and only a few of them were admitted to the ICU It is estimated that there are more than 100 herbal TCM formulae developed throughout\nChina's history for the purpose of saving people's lives during epidemic infections. These historic experiences of using TCM in fighting epidemics were capitalized during the Wuhan epidemic and widely employed in all hospitals in China. TCM is now credited for the successful battle against COVID-19 in China . Rheum palmatum could not only effectively improves the intestinal obstruction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients and rats with COPD, but also effectively improves dyspnea and gas exchange function (Zhang et al., 2014) . Thus, the primary guiding theory of treating COVID-19 is to expel the toxic moisture from the upper respiratory system and to improve intestinal obstruction. In essence, TCM is to maintain the balance of the lung meridian system, and to restore the balance between lung and intestine. It makes sense that TCM theory always guides the practice of TCM, including acupuncture and prescription of herbal medicine."}, {"section_title": "Clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients with TCM", "text": "COVID-19 is spread by droplets of containing the coronavirus from an infected person's cough, sneeze, or breath.

It requires a constant check and balance to protect our body from infectious and harmful substances. If the immune system is activated, it will respond to antigens associated with infectious diseases.\nTCM has employed holistic approaches and sees the body as an organic whole. The correlations between the organs and tissues, as well as the human and the living environments, are organized in a specific order, which give rise to mutual balance between each physiological function. This integral stability and harmony are the root of disease defense and health maintenance. Under normal circumstances, the body relies on the immune system to fight against various infections and to clean up harmful materials in order to keep a clean environment. TCMs perform dual roles on immunological regulation: immunological activation and immunological suppression (Ma, 2013) . Cell infected by pathogenic agents may trigger host humoral and cellular immunities which are essential to eliminate the viral infection (Florindo, 2020) . Therefore, the induction of a balanced host immune response is crucial to control and eliminate infection, employing adaptive and innate immune responses, as well as events mediated by the complement system. Two important approaches to achieve balanced immunity to fight infection. Accumulating evidence indicates that TCMs and their components can activate immune responses at the earliest stage by targeting key functions of dendritic cells, including their differentiation, maturation, cytokine production, survival, antigen uptake and presentation, and trafficking (Ma, 2013) . TCM actions on T lymphocytes has been validated. These results suggest that TCMs can promote T lymphocyte proliferation and transformation, stimulate cytotoxic T lymphocyte generation, adjust the imbalance of TH1 and TH2 responses, affect T cell subsets, and regulate T cell-mediated immunity (Jiang et al., 2010) . For instance, ginsenosides, the bioactive ingredients of Panax ginseng, have been reported to increase the immune activity of CD4+ T cells. Many TCM preparations such as ginseng spleen-invigorating pills and colla corii asini are used to induce hematopoiesis, enhance cellular immunity, and confer radioprotection (Attele et al., 1999; Lee et al., 2004; Lee and Han, 2006) . Recent studies have suggested that a number of TCMs have effects on cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF, and IFN-\u03b3 (Calixto et al., 2004; Spelman et al., 2006) . In the past several years, studies were undertaken to investigate the possible role of TCM on immune system. The research in TCM has recently sparked renewed interests in the development of novel therapeutic strategies to suppress the abnormal inflammation to treat allergy."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion and perspectives", "text": "TCM has always played a pivotal role in treating diseases and maintaining health for thousands of years and stands as testimony to a holistic approach. Unfortunately, the mechanisms of action of TCM are still largely unknown and under investigation. In the general view of the West, TCM appears to be anecdotal and non-scientific. The Western approach emphasizes the fast relief of symptoms at the disease site, particularly under critical conditions.\nHowever, single chemical entities targeting single receptor sites may not be sufficient to restore the functional balance of the body. The holistic approach has gained increasing popularity, because herbal medicine with its multi-component, multi-targeted approach focuses on the functional balance of the entire body. Therefore, in a broader perspective, herbal medicine should have certain advantages in dealing with complex human diseases with distorted immune-balance especially under epidemic infection. Recent advances in physiology and systems biology provide evidence that human diseases are highly complex, and that there is an important balance of immunity to protect population health and well-being. We believe that disease development and progression are linked closely to dysfunctional inflammation and immunity regardless of their physical, environmental, or psychological nature. More importantly, TCM has a long history of viewing an individual or patient as a whole. This holistic philosophy of TCM is now recognized by emerging network pharmacology and network biology and by sharing the common requirements of overcoming complex human diseases, such as cancer, in a systematic manner. Therefore, we advocate for a lifestyle with balanced immunity at the patient level as well as at the local and national levels to enhance population health -especially in dealing with epidemic infections.\nBased on the frequency of appearance of each medicinal herb and their corresponding pharmacological activities, the following TCM formula was reconstructed with the potential of treating COVID-19 infection. This TCM formula contains four top listed herbs and herbs with evidenced anti-virus activity along with reducing fever, removing dampness, expelling phlegm, and arresting coughing. It includes Bupleurum chinense (10 g), Ramulus Cinnamomi (10 g), Scutellaria baicalensis (10 g), Glycyrrhiza (15 g), Atractylodes macrocephala (10 g), Rhizoma\nZingiberis (10 g), Agastache rugosa (10 g), Stephania tetrandra root (10 g), Polygonum cuspidate (10 g), Rheum palmatum (10 g), Tangerine peel (10 g Especially, TCM theory such as the meridian system which guides all TCM treatments of human diseases has not been accepted in the western world. In this review, we provide strong scientific data supporting the treatment of COVID-19 infection with TCM formulae, particularly for the treatment of acute lung injuries (ALI) which is a common symptom in COVID-19 patients, and there is no other effective medication. For instance, MXSGT is a TCM formula used for treatment of respiratory system diseases, which has been investigated in the LPS-induced rat ALI, particularly with a focus on its effect on lung microvascular hyperpermeability and inflammatory reaction. Post-treatment with MXSGT ameliorated lung microvascular hyperpermeability and inflammation reaction, resulting in an elevation of survival rate of the rats after LPS exposure (Ma et al., 2014) . As we know, TCM may not be the best strategy in directly killing coronavirus or preventing infection at the entry level. Ma's study indicated the involvement of TLR-4, SRC, and NF-kB in the signaling pathway as responsible factor for the treatment effect of MXSGT on ALI. Therefore, it is conceivable that TCM formula such as MXSGT could be used as a safe and effective therapy aiming at ameliorating lung fluid accumulation and inflammatory infiltration. In view of the urgent need to heal the COVID-19 patients with acute lung injuries, TCM ought to play an important and active role in fighting the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.\nThis review article attempts to provide information for western health practitioner for a better understanding of TCM in treating epidemic infections including COVID-19, and the pharmacological effects of bioactive compounds used frequently in TCM formulae. Hopefully, we can benefit from the wisdom of ancient TCM by using cutting edge science and technologies in the 21 st century."}, {"section_title": "Conflict of interest", "text": "We wish to confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest associated with this publication and there has been no significant financial support for this work that could have influenced its outcome."}, {"section_title": "CREDIT AUTHOR STATEMEN", "text": "DYWL is responsible for the conceptual design of the paper and writing the draft QYL and JL are involved in clinical work and they contributed with writing the clinical parts.
