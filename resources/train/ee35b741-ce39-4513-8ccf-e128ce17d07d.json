The presence of cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia may explain some of the variability in age-related decline and in particular, may accelerate the rate of decline or the risk of incident cognitive impairment [1, 2] . Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a highly prevalent condition [3] that increases with age and is strongly related to cardiovascular risk [4] , including risk of cerebrovascular diseases [5] . A major role for CKD in accelerating cognitive decline with aging is therefore plausible, although prior studies testing this hypothesis have been limited.\nAmong patients with end-stage renal disease on maintenance dialysis, several cross-sectional studies have reported a high prevalence of cognitive impairment and lower average cognitive function when compared to controls with preserved renal function [6, 7] . In study samples from the general population and from patients with selected comorbidities, lower average neurocognition was also observed in association with mild-moderate decrements of renal function, suggesting that impairments are not limited to those with severe azotemia [8] [9] [10] . However, prior studies were limited by either a cross-sectional design [8, 9, 11] or by the use of global mental status measures (e.g. the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)) [10, 12] , which has limited sensitivity and specificity in detecting age-related changes in different cognitive functions with aging.\nThe primary aim of this study was to determine the association of changes in renal function with longitudinal changes in specific domains of cognitive function among community-dwelling, stroke-and dementia-free adults, using repeated assessments of multiple cognitive functions performed in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). We hypothesized that declining renal function would be associated with a more rapid decline in cognitive function."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Sample", "text": "The BLSA is a prospective cohort study of community-dwelling participants conducted by the National Institute on Aging's Intramural Research Program since 1958. Approximately every 2 years, participants visit the National Institute on Aging in Baltimore, Maryland, for medical, psychological and cognitive testing. Beginning in 1986, a more extensive neuropsychological test battery was administered at each visit to participants who were \u2265 60 years. The majority of tests for which data were analyzed in this study were therefore available only after 1986. The BLSA uses continuous enrollment procedures; thus, the years of enrollment and number of total visits differ among participants. In addition, for any given participant, the number of measures for each cognitive test may differ, depending on the time when a patient entered the study and in what year a given test was introduced to the test battery. For the purposes of the present analysis, participants with prior or incident stroke or a prior or incident diagnosis of dementia were excluded.

The Digits Forward and Digits Backward portions of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence ScaleRevised assessed the attention and concentration/working memory. Verbal learning and memory were assessed using the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), with derived scores including short and long free recall and the learning slope. Visual memory was assessed using the Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT). The trailmaking test parts A and B assessed attention, visuomotor scanning, perceptuomotor speed and mental flexibility (an executive function). Other tests included Letter and Category Fluency (phonemic and semantic association fluency, respectively, and executive function) and the Boston Naming Test (confrontation naming). The MMSE was administered as a screening test for general cognition; MMSE scores were not considered an outcome variable in this analysis due to the narrow range of scores observed."}, {"section_title": "Primary Predictor Variable", "text": "The primary measure of renal function was the inverse of serum creatinine (1/SCr). The decision to use 1/SCr rather formuladerived estimates of GFR was motivated by the use of mixed-regression models to estimate associations with change in cognitive function (see 'Statistical Analysis', below). The primary measures of association in these mixed-effects models are the coefficients for the interaction between age and renal function. Therefore, including MDRD-or CKD-Epi-estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) -which itself involves an interaction between age and 1/ SCr -as the primary measure of renal function would result in a model with significant challenges to interpretation. However, by accounting for factors other than GFR which influence creatinine levels -age, gender, race, body mass -as independent covariates in the mixed model, the model coefficients for age * 1/Scr can be reasonably interpreted as primarily representing the association of renal filtration function with changes in cognitive function. However, given the widespread use of eGFR in both clinical care and epidemiologic study of renal disease, we performed secondary analyses by replacing 1/SCr with eGFR using the 4-variable MDRD equation as the primary predictor variable."}, {"section_title": "Covariates", "text": "Age was scaled per decade, and education was measured in years.

Cigarette smoking was characterized as current versus former or never."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "All statistical analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.2 (Cary, N.C., USA). Mixed-effects linear regression models were developed to examine the longitudinal relations between renal and cognitive functions. Mixed-effects models are the preferred method for analyzing data in which repeated outcome measures are assessed at non-uniform intervals among individuals (i.e. unbalanced data). They allow for both fixed and random terms, accounting for correlation of repeated measures within individuals and are appropriate in the setting of variable lengths of follow-up among individual participants. Both renal and cognitive functions were measured at each BLSA visit; analyses thus examine coincident trajectories of renal and cognitive functions over time.\nIn order to maximize the information associated with each neuropsychological test, separate mixed models were developed for each test. Adjustment covariates were the same for each neurocognitive outcome and were selected apriori, based on factors which could plausibly relate to cognitive decline, based on prior studies of the BLSA [13] , and/or were plausibly related to renal function and SCr levels and included age, sex, education, mean arterial pressure, hemoglobin, smoking, comorbidity score, NSAID use and use of aspirin. All covariates other than sex were treated as time varying. In sensitivity analyses, additional adjustment was made for race, body mass and the use of antihypertensive medications.\nAge was also modeled as a random term to index time [14] . The practice of using age as a metric for time is recommended by McArdle and Bell [15] for instances in which a study lacks a natural baseline due to randomness of time of study entry, which is the case in the BLSA. The distribution of participants over time is regarded as a sample of performance opportunities across ages. With sufficient numbers of participants over a sufficiently broad range of ages, we can examine the overall differences in rates of change in time-varying effects. As a result, individuals with only a single measurement are able to contribute information to the analyses.\nModels included both main and interactive, longitudinal terms of interest. Significant main effects of renal function indicate that the cognitive outcome (collapsed across all available testing sessions) is associated with overall differences in renal function, regardless of longitudinal change. Longitudinal change in the cognitive outcome associated with renal function is indicated by the interaction term of renal function and age. The latter reflects age-related differences in cognitive decline as a function of prospectively assessed changes in renal function. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Participants", "text": "After exclusion of participants with stroke and/or dementia (n = 172), a total of 2,116 participants received at least one cognitive test.

Figure 1 a shows the model-based predicted CVLT score as a function of time and SCr level; with increasing levels of creatinine, the rate of decline of test performance is more rapid. A significant longitudinal age at 1/SCr interaction was also observed for the BVRT; however, the association differed significantly between men and women (test for interaction by sex, p = 0.002). Figure 1 b and c show the model-based estimated scores for the BVRT as a function of age and SCr, for both men (b) and women (c). The rate of decline in performance on the BVRT was greater with increasing levels of creatinine, but the association was more pronounced among men than among women. No significant independent associations of 1/SCr with rate of change in the other cognitive tests scores were observed, although performances on most tests were observed to decline over time ( table 2 ) .\nNo significant departure from linearity was observed for the longitudinal associations of 1/SCr with cognitive function. Additional adjustment for race, body mass, and use of antihypertensive medications (the latter two as time-varying covariates) did not materially change the results. Specifically, there remained a significant 1/SCr * age interaction for the CVLT learning slope (p < 0.05) and for the BVRT (p < 0.01), with a greater association of higher creatinine with age-related decline in the BVRT among men than among women (p < 0.001 for 1/Scr * age * sex interaction). Likewise, additional adjustment for the assay method for SCr (as a time-varying covariate) did not change the results (online suppl. table 2). In an additional sensitivity analysis, we examined whether associations differed after excluding those with prevalent cardiovascular disease and eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 at baseline. Results were largely unchanged: a significant age * 1/SCr interaction was still observed for the CVLT slope (online suppl. table 3) with greater age-related decline with higher SCr levels, and a significant longitudinal age * 1/SCr interaction was observed for the BVRT, with greater agerelated decline with higher SCr levels and more pronounced associations among men than among women. There was a significant age * 1/SCr * sex interaction for performance on the trail-making test part B; however, in neither men nor women was the decline in test performance related to SCr, and the interaction was driven largely by 4 influential outlying values."}, {"section_title": "Secondary Analysis: Association of eGFR and Longitudinal Cognitive Function Changes", "text": "Significant associations (p < 0.01) were also observed between eGFR and change in performance on the BVRT and CVLT learning slope, with the direction of the regression coefficients indicating slower decline with higher eGFR ( table 3 ).

In contrast, changes in renal function were not associated with a more rapid decline on tests of naming, executive function, language fluency or psychomotor speed. These findings are notable as the study sample was relatively healthy, with only 19% having diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, differences in rates of cognitive decline were observed over a relatively modest range of decreased renal function, and among participants without evidence of global cognitive impairment, as evidenced by excluding participants with dementia diagnoses.\nResults of our investigation are not directly comparable to prior studies of CKD and cognition given the differences in the specific cognitive tests used as well as differences between longitudinal and cross-sectional designs. Nevertheless, among prior studies, lower function in the domains of verbal and visual memory and learning has also been reported in association with end-stage renal disease [6] , non-dialysis CKD [16] and lower renal function [11] . The current study suggests that not only do individuals with renal impairment have lower function in verbal and/or visual memory, but also that they experience a faster rate of decline in these functions with aging. However, we did not find a relationship between declining renal function and more rapid decline on tests of psychomotor speed and complex attention, in contrast to some prior studies which found associations of renal impairment and lower performance in these functional domains. Although most of these studies were cross-sectional, a longitudinal analysis of older adults identified lower renal function as a predictor of more rapid decline in the performance of Digit Symbol Substitution Test, a measure of complex attention and set-shifting [17] . Other functional domains including memory and learning were not assessed in that study.\nThe factors which explain the associations between reduced renal function and more rapid age-related decline in cognitive functions remain uncertain, although a number of mechanisms have been proposed. For example, patients with renal impairment have associated systemic and cerebral vascular changes. Systemic changes include reduced vascular compliance and greater aortic stiffness, which have been linked to worse cognitive performance in older adults. Within the brain, even modestly lower renal function has been associated with a greater burden of white matter hyperintensities on cranial imaging [18, 19] , linked to cognitive impairment. In support of this hypothesis, we have previously reported that moderate renal impairment was associated with a greater long-term risk of incident vascular-type dementia in older adults, even after accounting for comorbidity [20] . Other potential factors linking renal impairment and disease with cognitive dysfunction include microinflammation, oxidative stress, hyperhomocysteinemia and altered nitric oxide metabolism. However, the causal relationships among renal function, cognitive function and these physiological factors remain uncertain.\nThe mechanisms underlying the sex difference in relation of renal decline to BVRT decline remain unclear. Visual memory performance is heavily reliant on medial temporal lobe function, and animal research suggests that age-related hippocampal atrophy is more pronounced among men than among women [21] . However, the absence of sex differences between renal function and CVLT performance suggests that other factors are involved, giv- Limitations of the study include the use of SCr as a renal function marker, which can result in misclassification of true GFR due to interindividual differences in creatinine generation and tubular secretion. However, results were similar when eGFR was used as an alternative renal function marker. The BLSA is a sample of convenience and does not represent a true community-or population-based study sample. Participants were well educated as compared to the general population and were recruited from one geographic location; therefore, the results may not be generalizable to other populations. We cannot exclude the possibility of a type I (false-positive) error in the setting of examination of associations with multiple cognitive test outcomes. However, the similarity of results when either 1/SCr or eGFR was used as a renal function marker suggests that the observed associations with visual and verbal memory are not due to chance alone. Finally, this study sample did not have measurements of albuminuria, which has also been linked to cognitive dysfunction independent of renal filtration function [22, 23] .\nStrengths of the study include the longitudinal study design, the more extensive cognitive test battery administered and the evaluation of multiple potential confounders. Simultaneous examination of decline in kidney function in relation to decline in cognitive function represents a unique contribution to the literature and parallels the recent findings involving the decline of kidney function and prospective cardiovascular risk [24] ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In conclusion, among a community-dwelling adult population, modest decline in renal function is associated with a greater decline in verbal memory/learning and visual memory with age, after accounting for differences in demographics and comorbidity, whereas no associations were observed with decline in other cognitive domains. These findings are notable in the context of a relatively healthy sample (i.e. low comorbidity), across a modest range of decreased renal function and without cognitive impairment. Future investigation is needed to determine the factors that explain these associations."}]
