[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. In the current clinical setting, AD is diagnosed by clinical criteria proposed by McKann et al. 1 Development of disease modifying drugs requires accurate diagnostic tools. The crerbrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta (A\u03b21-42), total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau181) are promising diagnostic biomarkers.\n2 They are correlated with the pathogenesis of AD. CSF biomarkers are not only an important diagnostic tool for AD, but also an important prognostic indicator of the disease decades before its onset. Methods We included participants who had CSF biomarker data in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. We investigated the factors related to CSF biomarkers in patients with AD using linear mixed models. Using the factors, we developed models corresponding to CSF biomarkers to classify patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) into high risk and low risk and analyzed the conversion from MCI to AD using the Cox proportional hazards model. Results APOE \u03b54 status and age were significantly related to CSF A\u03b21-42. CSF t-tau, APOE \u03b52 status and sex were significant factors. The CSF p-tau181 was associated with age and frequency of diagnosis. Accordingly, we modeled the three CSF biomarkers of AD. In MCI without APOE \u03b54, our models were better predictors of conversion. Conclusions We can interpret CSF biomarkers based on the models derived from the data obtained from patients with AD.\nKey Words Alzheimer's disease, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker, mild cognitive impairment, diagnosis, prediction, conversion.

In addition, the CSF biomarkers of controls who represent a high-risk group show an AD signature pattern. Therefore, we need to determine other ways to define the cutoff values for the CSF biomarkers.\nThe results of CSF biomarkers in AD are homogenous compared with those of the controls. 5 In this study, we determined the factors associated with CSF biomarkers in AD. We then defined new cut-off values using appropriate models based on those factors. 6 We included subjects who had data involving CSF A\u03b21-42, t-tau, or p-tau181 in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The participants included 631 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and 234 patients with AD whose diagnoses were determined at baseline. Among patients with AD, a patient who reverted to aMCI during a follow-up visit was excluded. The participants' ages ranged between 55 and 90 years (inclusive), good overall health to be included in the study. Other inclusion criteria were: treatment with medications stably for 4 weeks, appropriate visual and auditory acuity for neuropsychological testing, and scores on modified Hachinski scales \u22644 and geriatric depression scales <6. 7, 8 The patients with aMCI met the criteria proposed by Petersen et al. 9 They had abnormal memory function which was tested by delayed paragraph recall of logical memory II. In addition, their Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were 24-30 with a memory Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of at least 0.5. Patients with AD met the 'probable' criteria of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association. 1 The ADNI includes patients with early stages of AD and MMSE scores of 20-26 and a sum-of-box CDR of 1-9 at their baseline visits. The exclusion criteria were: absence of other neurologic diseases such as Parkinson's disease, multi-infarct dementia, brain tumor, Huntington's disease, normal pressure hydrocephalus, brain tumor, progressive supranuclear palsy, seizure disorder, subdural hematoma, multiple sclerosis, or history of significant head trauma followed by persistent neurologic defaults or known structural brain abnormalities. Participants did not have major depression or bipolar disorder within the past 1 year, or alcohol/drug abuse within the past two years. They had no history of schizophrenia. Subjects who were contraindicated for MRI due to the presence of aneurysmal clips or pacemakers were excluded. We downloaded ADNI data on June 2014. The characteristics of people with normal cognition, aMCI and patients with AD including age, sex, years of education, APOE \u03b52 status, and APOE \u03b54 status are summarized in Table 1 .\nThe statistical analyses were conducted using PASW (version 21.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Graphical presentations were performed using R (version 3.0.1). Table 2 displays the selection of the factors affecting CSF biomarker concentrations of patients with AD, using the mixed models. We selected factors with p\u22640.10 and determined the interaction between the factors. Based on significant interactions, we separated factors to create a fitting model. We selected APOE \u03b54 status (p<0.001) and age (p=0.10) as the factors significantly related with CSF A\u03b21-42. For CSF t-tau, APOE \u03b52 status (p=0.009) and sex (p<0.001) were significant factors. Age (p=0.005) and time from diagnosis (p=0.004) were the significant factors for CSF p-tau181. We identified interactions between CSF A\u03b21-42 related factors (APOE \u03b54 status and age, p= 0.020) and between t-tau related factors (APOE \u03b52 status and sex, p=0.034).\n"}, {"section_title": "METHODS Participants", "text": "Baseline assessment and longitudinal assessment 10 All subjects underwent neurological examination, physical examination, and neuropsychological assessments at baseline.

The purpose of the first analysis was to identify the biological factors affecting the concentrations of CSF A\u03b21-42, t-tau, or p-tau181 in AD.

In the absence of APOE \u03b54, a linear increase was observed in age. In APOE \u03b54 heterozygotes, a parabolic shape with apex at about 67 was observed. In APOE \u03b54 homozygotes, the CSF A\u03b21-42 decreased linearly with respect to age. The CSF t-tau is related to gender by APOE \u03b52 (Fig. 2) . The distribution of CSF p-tau181 decreased linearly with age at baseline visit (Fig. 3) . We assumed that the conversion to AD may be predicted accurately in patients with MCI using the new models. To test this hypothesis, the CSF results of MCI, based on age, sex, APOE \u03b52, and APOE \u03b54 were used to distinguish the normal/ abnormal conditions as shown in Fig. 4 . As shown in Fig. 5 , in MCI without APOE \u03b54, our cut-off methods showed lower false positives in the predicted normal group and lower false negatives in the predicted AD group (Fig. 5) . However, in MCI with APOE \u03b54 heterozygotes, our cut-off methods produced higher false negative rate in the predicted normal group. In APOE \u03b54 homozygotes, it played no role in predicting the conversion, because APOE \u03b54 homozygote itself was a significant predictor of disease. "}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In our study, we considered only patients with AD for the determination of the cut-off values for the CSF biomarkers. In addition, conversion from MCI to AD can be more accurately predicted by considering age, sex, APOE \u03b52, and APOE \u03b54 status. The new cut-off methods were particularly accurate for subjects without APOE \u03b54.\nOur study provided insight into the role of CSF biomarkers by plotting their concentrations according to the related factors. The interaction between age and APOE \u03b54 affected the concentrations of CSF A\u03b21-42, and therefore, age and the APOE \u03b54 status were analyzed separately (Fig. 1) . In the APOE \u03b54 non-carriers, the concentration of CSF A\u03b21-42 was correlated linearly with age, although it showed a negative quadratic curve according to age in the APOE \u03b54 heterozygotes. In the APOE \u03b54 homozygotes, it was reduced to a negative correlation depending on age. Interestingly, the t-tau levels varied between patients with and without APOE \u03b52 (Fig.  2) . The levels of t-tau also differed according to sex. The CSF p-tau181 concentration was decreased according to age.\nOur cut-off methods were accurate predictors of conversions particularly in MCI without APOE \u03b54 (Fig. 5) . Introduction of preventive medicines may decrease the cost of our methods by decreasing falsely classified MCI with AD signatures. In addition, it increases the effectiveness of preventive medicines by decreasing the falsely classified MCI without AD signatures. However, our methods may decrease the specificity for MCI with APOE \u03b54.\nAge was an important factor associated with CSF A\u03b21-42 in AD without APOE \u03b54 and with p-tau181. The older patients with AD show mixed pathologies of subcortical vascular dementia, hippocampal sclerosis, argyrophilic grain disease, and suspected non-amyloid pathology. [12] [13] [14] The additional pathologies can cause dementia in patients with less severe amyloid or tau burden in their brain. However, further studies are required to elucidate the role of gender in CSF t-tau. In addition, the further studies are needed to account for the age-related changes in CSF A\u03b21-42 found in the APOE \u03b54 heterozygotes, because of the lower number of patients in young (<70) and old (>80) groups compared with the 70-80 year age group.\nWe found two noble points. First, we found factors that affect CSF biomarkers in patients with AD. Recently, Li et al. 15 and Lautner et al. 16 reported that age, sex, and APOE \u03b54 are factors that affect CSF A\u03b21-42 in subjects with normal cognition. These two studies overlooked that the CSF biomarkers in subjects with normal cognition showed average results for two completely different groups-high risk and low risk groups for AD. The proportion of high risk patients for AD increased with age in subjects with normal cognition. Second, we have redefined the cut-off methods of CSF biomarkers using factors that affect CSF biomarkers. In this study, we indicated that the current cut-off values for APOE \u03b54 noncarrier was less specific and resulted in several false negatives.\nIn conclusion, we established better cut-off values of CSF biomarkers, which were made only from patients with AD, and not from controls. In addition, age, sex, and APOE genotype play a key role in the interpretation of the cut-off values of CSF biomarkers."}, {"section_title": "Conflicts of Interest", "text": "The authors have no financial conflicts of interest."}]
