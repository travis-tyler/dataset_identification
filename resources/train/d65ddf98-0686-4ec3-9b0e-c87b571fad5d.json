When adjusted for inflation, academic R&D increased 6 percent in FY 2001, compared with the 4.3 percent constant dollar average annual growth that was reported during the previous 10 years. These statistics are derived from the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Survey of Research and Development Expenditures at Universities and Colleges (Academic R&D Survey) and are for science and engineering R&D activities only. Federally financed academic R&D spending increased 10 percent (7 percent in constant dollars) in FY 2001 to $19.2 billion. Federal funding provided 59 percent of the R&D dollars expended at universities and colleges (table 1). Increases in R&D expenditures from all non-Federal sources combined increased by $1 billion-8 percentreaching $13.5 billion in FY 2001. Funds from institutions' own sources increased the fastest, over 10 percent in FY 2001. Funds from all other nongovemment/nonindustry sources (including private foundations and voluntary sources) rose 8 percent. State and local governments' funds were up 5 percent in FY 2001, and industry funding was up 4 percent. 'Separately budgeted research and development (R&D) includes all funds expended for activities specifically organized to produce research and development outcomes and commissioned by an agency either external to the institution or separately budgeted by an organizational unit within the institution.

Interviews with respondents revealed that in some cases abnormal or erroneous values (such as zero percent basic research) were imputed forward for several years. The revised imputation methodology carries forward the prior year's basic research share only if that year's data were reported or estimated by the respondent. In all other cases an econometric model is now used to impute the amount of total and Federal basic research for the respondent. The model employed takes into account differences between public and private institutions and non-Federal sources of R&D funding.

In FY 2001, 7.2 percent of all federally funded academic R&D was passed through to subrecipients as contrasted to 1.8 percent of all non-Federal sources of funds. It is unclear whether this difference is the result of Federal sources of funding explicitly encouraging cross-institution R&D collaboration. In addition to reporting R&D funds passed through to all subrecipients, respondents also differentiate funds passed through to educational subrecipients and other subrecipients. Given the coverage of the Academic R&D Survey and the specific wording of its instructions, it is 'The response rate for this item was 89.4 percent in FY 1998, 87.5 percent in FY 1999, 89.2 percent in FY 2000, and 89.5 percent in FY 2001. Values for this item are not imputed for nonrespondents so reported totals are possibly underestimates of true totals. In addition, some respondents reporting total and Federal funds passed through did not break out these funds by type of subrecipient (educational or other). reasonable to believe that virtually all of the R&D expenditures that were reported as being passed to educational subrecipients were captured by the survey twice-from the originating institutions and from the subrecipient institutions. Although it is more difficult for respondents to identify funds they received as subrecipients, data collected by NSF related to this question confirm this hypothesis.'"}, {"section_title": "Data Notes", "text": "The academic R&D expenditures data presented in this Info Brief were obtained from 609 universities and colleges that grant graduate degrees in the sciences or engineering and expend at least $150 thousand in research in the surveyed fiscal year.
