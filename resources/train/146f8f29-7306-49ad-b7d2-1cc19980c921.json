[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Childhood trauma is a risk factor for psychosis. Amphetamine increases synaptic striatal dopamine levels and can induce positive psychotic symptoms in healthy individuals and patients with schizophrenia. Socio-developmental hypotheses of psychosis propose that childhood trauma and other environmental risk factors sensitize the dopamine system to increase the risk of psychotic symptoms, but this remains to be tested in humans. We used [ 11 C]-(+)-PHNO positron emission tomography to measure striatal dopamine-2/3 receptor (D 2/3 R) availability and ventral striatal dexamphetamine-induced dopamine release in healthy participants (n = 24). The relationships between dexamphetamine-induced dopamine release, dexamphetamine-induced positive psychotic symptoms using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and childhood trauma using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) were assessed using linear regression and mediation analyses, with childhood trauma as the independent variable, dexamphetamine-induced dopamine release as the mediator variable, and dexamphetamine-induced symptoms as the dependent variable. There was a significant interaction between childhood trauma and ventral striatal dopamine release in predicting dexamphetamine-induced positive psychotic symptoms (standardized \u03b2 = 1.83, p = 0.003), but a mediation analysis was not significant (standardized \u03b2 = \u22120.18, p = 0.158). There were no significant effects of dopamine release and childhood trauma on change in negative (p = 0.280) or general PANSS symptoms (p = 0.061), and there was no relationship between ventral striatal baseline D 2/3 R availability and positive symptoms (p = 0.368). This indicates childhood trauma and dopamine release interact to influence the induction of positive psychotic symptoms. This is not consistent with a simple sensitization hypothesis, but suggests that childhood trauma moderates the cognitive response to dopamine release to make psychotic experiences more likely."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Schizophrenia is among the leading causes of global disease burden and is associated with high mortality and morbidity [1] [2] [3] . It is a complex disorder with a multifactorial aetiology involving both neurobiological alterations and environmental risk factors 4, 5 . However, the relationship between neurobiological and environmental risk factors, and how they interact to increase the risk of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, is currently not known.\nThe dopamine hypothesis has been a leading neurobiological theory of schizophrenia for several decades [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .\nSupporting the theory, administration of drugs that increase dopamine levels such as amphetamine or cocaine induces psychotic symptoms in both healthy people [12] [13] [14] and patients with schizophrenia 15 . Molecular imaging studies have characterized the nature of the in vivo dopaminergic changes in schizophrenia, showing higher dopamine synthesis capacity and amphetamine-induced dopamine release with large effect sizes in patients with the disorder 6 . To our knowledge, seven of eight imaging studies found that schizophrenia is associated with increased striatal dopamine release induced by amphetamine [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] , and a further study found greater striatal dopamine release induced by acute stress exposure 24 . In addition, a number of these studies report a direct correlation between the magnitude of amphetamine-induced dopamine release in the striatum and amphetamine-induced psychotic symptoms in patients with psychosis [16] [17] [18] . However, individuals vary in the degree to which amphetamine induces psychotic symptoms 14 , suggesting that other factors may moderate individual vulnerability.\nOne of the most consistent environmental risk factors associated with schizophrenia is experiencing trauma in childhood and adolescence. Childhood traumas, such as neglect, physical, sexual and psychological abuse, increase the risk for psychosis in adulthood with odds ratios of 2.8-3.6 (refs. [25] [26] [27] [28] ). Large population-based studies also found positive dose-response relationships between trauma and subclinical psychotic symptoms as well as the persistence of psychotic experiences in the general population [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] , suggesting that childhood trauma may increase the risk for developing psychotic symptoms as well as a psychotic disorder. However, not everyone exposed to childhood trauma develops psychosis, suggesting biological vulnerability is also relevant.\nIt has been proposed that childhood trauma, and other environmental stressors, sensitizes the mesostriatal dopamine system to the effects of later challenges, such as amphetamine, subsequently leading to the development of psychotic symptoms 4, [35] [36] [37] [38] . Supporting this, preclinical studies in rodents show increased amphetamine-induced dopamine release in the ventral striatum in animals exposed to a range of stressors during early development, including maternal deprivation 39 , neonatal isolation 40, 41 , social isolation and social defeat 42 . Moreover, in vivo human positron emission tomography (PET) studies show that humans who reported lower maternal care during childhood have greater stress-induced dopamine release 43 , and participants who have experienced a greater number of traumatic events in childhood and higher levels of perceived stress have elevated levels of amphetamine-induced dopamine release 44 , both in the ventral striatum. In addition, increased dopamine synthesis capacity has been found in adults exposed to childhood adversity (both healthy individuals and those at ultra-high risk of psychosis) 45 . However, to our knowledge, the relationships between childhood trauma, amphetamine-induced dopamine release and induced psychotic symptoms remain poorly understood. In particular, it remains unknown whether childhood trauma and amphetamine-induced dopamine release are associated with induced positive psychotic symptoms in isolation, whether childhood trauma interacts with amphetamineinduced dopamine release to induce positive psychotic symptoms (moderation effect) or whether childhood trauma influences induced psychotic symptoms through amphetamine-induced dopamine release (mediation effect).\nIn view of this, we tested the relationships between childhood trauma and dexamphetamine-induced striatal dopamine release to predict dexamphetamine-induced positive psychotic symptoms using both moderation and mediation models. We also tested whether these relationships were specific to striatal dopamine release capacity, or whether they were also related to baseline striatal dopamine-2/3 receptor (D 2/3 R) availability. We focused on the ventral striatum as this region has previously been shown to be sensitive to the effect of childhood adversity on the magnitude of amphetamineinduced dopamine release 43, 44, 46 . We hypothesized that the interaction and/or mediation between childhood trauma and dopamine release capacity would predict dexamphetamine-induced positive psychotic symptoms, in light of the sensitization of the mesostriatal dopamine system described above 4, [35] [36] [37] [38] , and evidence showing that dopamine release in isolation is not correlated with an increase in amphetamine-induced positive symptom scores in young adults with hearing impairment 47 ."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "The study was approved by the West London & GTAC NHS research ethics committee (12/LO/1955).

Sexual abuse is defined as \"sexual contact or conduct between a child younger than 18 years of age and an adult or older person\". Physical abuse is defined as \"bodily assaults on a child by an adult or older person that posed a risk of or resulted in injury\".

Physical neglect is defined as \"the failure of caretakers to provide for a child's basic physical needs, including food, shelter, clothing, safety, and health care\". Emotional neglect is defined as \"the failure of caretakers to meet children's basic emotional and psychological needs, including love, belonging, nurturance, and support\".

Next, we investigated whether the interaction between these two variables was a significant predictor of positive psychotic symptoms, by running a linear regression model, which included dexamphetamine-induced change in positive psychotic symptoms as the dependent variable, and the following predictor (independent) variables: ventral striatum dopamine release capacity (\u0394BP ND ), childhood trauma (CTQ score), and the interaction between these variables (\u0394BP ND \u00d7 CTQ score).

To test the anatomical specificity, we repeated the model after substituting in dexamphetamine-induced dopamine release within the associative or sensorimotor striatum, in place of the ventral striatum.

However, we did not find any positive relationship between history of childhood trauma and induced striatal dopamine release-instead the relationship in our sample was negative (Pearson's r = \u22120.488, p = 0.016) ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). This is seemingly at odds with predictions from theories proposing that childhood trauma sensitizes the dopamine system to psychological and pharmacological challenge in later life 4, 35 . Rodents exposed to early stressors exhibit increased dopamine levels after stimulant administration in the nucleus accumbens (ventral striatum) [39] [40] [41] [42] 79, 80 . Human PET studies have also shown increased stress-induced dopamine release in the ventral striatum in people with history of low maternal care 43 , as well as increased amphetamine-induced dopamine-release in individuals with a greater number of traumatic events in childhood 44 and individuals with hearing impairment 47 . Furthermore, positive correlations between amphetamine-induced dopamine release in the ventral striatum and plasma cortisol levels have also been observed in healthy individuals 46, 81 . Oswald et al. found that the relationship between childhood traumatic exposure and dopamine release was mediated by perceived stress in adulthood, where higher levels of perceived stress were associated with higher ventral striatal dopamine responses to amphetamine 44 . This observation may explain the apparent inconsistency between our findings and these previous findings if there is lower perceived stress in adulthood in people with high CTQ scores in our sample. However, as we did no measure perceived stress in adulthood, this remains to be tested and highlights that it would be useful to measure perceived stress as well in future studies. Nevertheless, the interaction between childhood trauma load and ventral striatal dopamine release on the induction of psychotic symptoms indicates that a history of greater childhood trauma increases an individual's vulnerability to the psychotogenic effects of striatal dopamine release, in line with cognitive schema-interpretation model of psychosis 4 .\nThe potential mechanism underlying the interaction effect on the induction of psychotic symptoms Human fMRI studies implicate the ventral striatum in errors of salience attribution for both appetitive, aversive stimuli [82] [83] [84] [85] , and specifically indicates its role in belief updating following salient stimuli 86 . Ventral striatal dopamine regulates the processing of the salience of stimuli, and, by increasing dopamine release, amphetamine is thought to disrupt this to lead to salience being aberrantly assigned to stimuli 8, 87, 88 . Externalizing cognitive schema, such as being more likely to interpret experiences to be threatening or out of personal control are associated with a greater likelihood of psychotic symptoms in clinical and non-clinical samples 8, [88] [89] [90] [91] . Childhood trauma is characterized by experiences of threat and loss of control to others, which could lead to more negative or externalizing cognitive schema. Supporting this, childhood trauma has been associated with hostile attribution biases and negative self-schema 92, 93 . Thus, this evidence suggests the interaction we observe between childhood trauma and dopamine release in the induction of psychotic symptoms could be explained by childhood trauma altering cognitive schema to be more externalizing, leading to a greater likelihood of a psychotic-like interpretation of aberrant salience following dopamine release by amphetamine. Whilst this interpretation is speculative, this could be tested in future studies by determining if cognitive schema mediate the interaction between traumatic childhood experiences and dopamine release on the induction of psychotic symptoms. It should also be recognized that other brain regions, in particular frontal cortical regions, are involved in salience processing and altered cortico-striatal connectivity has been found in people with a history of childhood trauma 94 and linked to striatal dopamine release 95 , indicating other brain regions could also be involved in mediating this interaction."}, {"section_title": "Specificity of the findings to the ventral (limbic) striatum", "text": "Our finding that the effect is specific to the limbic striatum contrasts with those of a recent meta-analysis indicating that the main locus of increased dopamine synthesis capacity in schizophrenia is the associative striatum, and not the ventral (limbic) striatum 96 . However, it is not known whether these meta-analytic findings can be extended to pharmacologically induced dopamine release as there are conflicting results in the literature. One study in patients with schizophrenia and comorbid substance dependence showed significant associations between amphetamine-induced dopamine release in the ventral striatum and the precommissural caudate (associative striatum) and change in positive symptoms 97 , whilst another study using [ 18 C]-fallypride found an association between schizotypal traits and amphetamineinduced dopamine release in the head of the caudate but extending into the ventral striatum 98 . Two other studies found that patients with schizophrenia had a similar range of BP ND reduction in the ventral striatum and sensorimotor striatum at 6-10 h following dexamphetamine administration 99 , and that patients with schizophrenia had mean (SD) percentage reduction of 17.6% (7.8) in the ventral striatum and 24.4% (7.2) in the sensorimotor striatum 22 . To our knowledge, none of the other studies of amphetamine-induced dopamine release have examined sub-regional differences in striatal dopamine release in schizophrenia [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . The ventral striatum is the most sensitive region to amphetamine-induced dopamine release 56, 59, [100] [101] [102] . Interestingly, a study examining amphetamine sensitization in healthy individuals found that an initial dose of amphetamine caused dopamine release in the ventral striatum whilst further doses at 14 and 365 days elicited increased dopamine release in the ventral striatum relative to the initial dose, with sensitized dopamine release progressively extending to the dorsal caudate and putamen 103 . Furthermore, a longitudinal study of people scanned in the prodrome and then again when acutely psychotic showed progressive increases in dopamine synthesis capacity in the dorsal striatum 104 . Thus, these findings could suggest that the initial dopaminergic response is in the ventral striatum which then extends to the dorsal striatum with the development of a psychotic disorder, but further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. Lastly, the regional specificity of the findings to the ventral striatum might also reflect tracer-specific factors. [ 11 C]-(+)-PHNO is more sensitive to amphetamine-induced dopamine release in the ventral striatum than D 2/3 R antagonist tracers such as [ 11 C]raclopride 56 , a property that may be related to its high affinity for the D 3 R, which is more abundant in the ventral compared to the associative striatum and [ 11 C]-(+)-PHNO."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "The first limitation of this study is that all individuals were healthy volunteers, limiting the generalizability of these findings to patients with psychotic disorders. This may account for the relatively small increase in PANSS score following dexamphetamine. Further studies are therefore needed to examine the relationships between childhood trauma, dopamine release and positive psychotic symptoms in clinical populations, and to examine stress-induced dopamine release. Second, the study was cross-sectional and exposure to childhood trauma was assessed retrospectively via questionnaires, and could be influenced by recall bias. However, retrospective assessment of childhood trauma has been shown to be reliable in both healthy population and patients with psychosis 105 . Lastly, it is possible that a third variable that correlates with both dopamine release and CTQ mediates the relationship we observe. However, we found no evidence that clinico-demographic factors that have been reported to be related to dopamine release such as gender, nicotine, alcohol, cannabis morphine or stimulants 49, [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] are related to CTQ scores in our sample."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Childhood trauma and ventral striatal dopamine release interact to influence the emergence of positive psychotic symptoms following dexamphetamine. This is not consistent with a simple dopamine sensitization model for the link between childhood trauma and psychosis risk, but could, instead, suggest that childhood trauma moderates the cognitive response to dopamine release to make psychotic experiences more likely."}]
