The highest tertile of IGFBP-2, compared to the lowest tertile, was associated with an increased risk of incident all-cause dement ia (hazard ratio [HR] 2.89, 95% CI 1.63-5.13) and Alzheimer's disease (HR 3.63, 95% CI 1.76-7.50) in multivariable analysis. Higher circulating IGFBP2 levels were also cross-sectionally associated with poorer performance on tests of abstract reasoning but not with MRI-based outcomes. After adding plasma IGFBP-2 levels to a conventional dementia prediction model, 32% of individuals with dementia were correctly assigned a higher predicted risk, while 8% of individuals without dementia were correctly assigned a lower predicted risk (overall net reclassification improvement index, 0.40, 95% CI 0.22-0.59). Interpretation: Elevated circulating IGFBP-2 levels were associated with an increased risk of both all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

Background Identifying novel biomarkers for dementia and cognitive decline can inform our understanding of the complex biological pathways underpinning the development of dementia, improve our ability to detect disease at an earlier stage, and identify future potential therapeutic targets for investigation. 1 There is growing evidence to suggest that metabolic dysfunction and insulin resistance in the brain play an important role in the development of dementia. [2] [3] [4] The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling system is known to play a role in neuroregeneration, neuronal survival and proliferation, and cerebral metabolic function. 5, 6 Circulating IGF-I and IGF-II are typically bound to one of six known IIGF-binding proteins. While IGFBP-3 is the most prominent IGF-binding protein in the circulation, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP-2) is the most predominant IGF-binding protein in the brain, and thus was selected as the focus of this study. Elevated levels of IGF-binding proteins, particularly IGFBP-2, are thought to reduce IGF-I and IGF-II bioavailability in the brain and impair IGF signaling, thereby inhibiting the neuroprotective effects of IGF-I and IGF-II. [7] [8] [9] Elevated plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) IGFBP-2 levels have previously been crosssectionally associated with hippocampal atrophy and Alzheimer's disease (AD) in small studies. 6, 7, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] It is unknown, however, if plasma IGFBP-2 levels are predictive of adverse cognitive outcomes, including risk of developing dementia, over long-term follow-up. Given the growing interest in dementia therapeutics targeting dysregulated insulin metabolism and IGF signaling, 17, 18 IGFBP-2 could be a useful circulating biomarker for predicting dementia risk, a surrogate marker for future clinical trials and a potential therapeutic target. In this study, we aimed to determine the association between plasma IGFBP-2 levels and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain measures, cognitive performance, and incident dementia and AD dementia, in a large, prospective cohort of cognitively healthy adults."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study sample", "text": "The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Offspring cohort is a large community-based cohort that has been followed for more than 40 years (instituted between 1971 and 1975) for the development of vascular risk factors, decline in cognitive performance, stroke, and dementia. 19 Every 4 years, participants attend a follow-up examination. In this study, we included participants in the Offspring cohort aged 60 years or older who attended examination cycle 7 (1998-2001) , had plasma IGFBP-2 measured at this exam, and were free of a diagnosis of dementia with data available on dementia status on follow-up. The study protocols and consent forms were approved by the institutional review board at Boston University Medical Center (H-35519, H-22765) and all participants provided written informed consent. At cohort inception in 1971, 5124 participants were recruited into the FHS Offspring cohort, of whom 3539 were alive and attended examination 7. Of these, 3219 were free of dementia with available data on dementia status during follow-up, 1603 were aged 60 years or older, and 1596 had plasma IGFBP-2 levels measured, resulting in a cohort sample size of 1596 participants for the primary outcome analysis ( Fig. 1 )."}, {"section_title": "Outcome measures", "text": "The primary outcome measure was incident all-cause dementia developing after examination cycle 7 up to December 2014. In the FHS Offspring cohort, all participants are systematically screened for the development of dementia via the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and annual health status updates starting from examination 5. In addition, all participants were invited to complete a brain MRI and neuropsychological testing starting after each of examinations 7 through 9. If any concern for cognitive impairment is raised (e.g. by a participant, family member, or study physician) or if the MMSE score is five points lower than the participant's previous highest recorded score, three points lower than the preceding examination, or below the education-based cutoff, in-depth neuropsychological testing is performed. 20 The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th edition) criteria were used to diagnose dementia, requiring impairment in memory and at least one other domain of cognitive function, in addition to documented functional disability. The final diagnosis of dementia was based on a committee review of neurological examination records, neuropsychological assessments, neuroimaging results, outpatient/inpatient/nursing home records, family interviews, and, where available, autopsy results. The committee included at least one neuropsychologist and one neurologist. AD dementia was also a primary outcome measure. A diagnosis of AD was based on the criteria of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association for definite, probable, or possible Alzheimer's disease. 21 We included structural MRI brain measures as secondary measures (n = 2074) according to the following methods. Removal of nonbrain tissues: Using an atlas-based method, the skull is removed. Structural MRI brain images are nonlinearly registered via a cubic B-spline deformation to a minimal deformation template synthetic brain image. A template-based iterative method is used to correct for any field inhomogeneity bias. Gray matter, white matter, and CSF measurement: an expectation-maximization algorithm is employed that iteratively refines its segmentation estimates to produce outputs that are most consistent with the input intensities from the native-space T1 images along with a model of image smoothness. The segmentation yielded by these appearance models is refined using a Markov random field model and an adaptive prior model. Total brain volume (TBV) was defined as supratentorial brain volume as a percentage of the intracranial volume determined via coronal sections. White matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume is performed on a combination of FLAIR and 3D T1 images using a modified Bayesian probability structure based on a previously published method of histogram fitting and adjusting for intracranial volume. Prior probability maps for WMH were created from more than 700 individuals with semiautomatic detection of WMH followed by manual editing. Likelihood estimates of the native image are calculated through histogram segmentation and thresholding. All segmentation is initially performed in standard space resulting in probability likelihood values of WMH at each voxel in the white matter. These probabilities are then thresholded at 3.5 SD above the mean to create a binary WMH mask. Further segmentation is based on a modified Bayesian approach that combines image likelihood estimates, spatial priors, and tissue class constraints. The segmented WMH masks are then back-transformed on to native space for tissue volume calculation. Volumes are log-transformed to normalize population variance. The automatic hippocampal segmentation method employs a standard atlas-based diffeomorphic approach with the minor modification of label refinement. We further modified this approach to include the European Alzheimer's Disease Consortium-Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (EADC-ADNI) harmonized hippocampal masks using the following approach: (1) Subject image preprocessing with extraction of intracranial cavity, nonuniformity correction, tissue classification as discussed above; (2) Atlas registration of all EADC-ADNI hippocampal masks to each subject; (3) Atlas fusion; and (4) intensity-based label refinement. Hippocampal volume was adjusted for intracranial volume. The presence of MRI covert brain infarcts (CBIs) was determined from the size, location, and imaging characteristics of the lesions. The image analysis system allowed for superimposition of the subtraction image, the proton density image, and the T2-weighted image at three times magnified view to assist in interpretation of lesion characteristics. Signal void, best seen on the T2-weighted image, was interpreted to indicate a vessel. Only lesions 3 mm or larger qualified for consideration as cerebral infarcts. Kappa values for agreement among the three raters range from 0.73 to 0.90. 22, 23 We also included peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) in those participants who had an MRI brain performed at exam 9 ([n = 896], as these measures were not included prior to exam 9), according to previously published methods. 24 Imaging data were centrally processed and analyzed by operators blinded to all participant characteristics including cognitive performance on neuropsychological testing.\nWe included performance on neuropsychological tests at examination 7 as additional secondary outcomes, to determine if IGFBP-2 levels were cross-sectionally associated with deficits in specific cognitive domains. Specific tests included the visual reproductions delayed recall test, Similarities test, logical memory delayed recall, Trail Making Test (Parts B and A), and Hooper visual organization test (HVOT). Trail Making Test scores were inverse transformed and higher scores for individual test components indicated superior performance.

Addition of plasma IGFBP-2 to a model of traditional risk factors for dementia resulted in improved dementia risk prediction.\nElevated plasma IGFBP-2 was associated with an increased risk of incident all-cause dementia as well as AD dementia. This relationship followed a dose-response pattern, with an increasing risk of dementia and AD dementia per increasing tertile of plasma IGFBP-2. Previous cross-sectional studies have noted elevated CSF levels of IGFBP-2 in patients with AD, 6,10 as well as elevated levels of IGFBP-2 in the plasma of patients with AD. 6, [12] [13] [14] 16 Our results extend these findings by demonstrating a longitudinal association between plasma IGFBP-2 levels measured at a median age of 68 years and subsequent risk of developing dementia over long-term follow-up. Unlike one prior study, 6 we found no attenuation in this association after accounting for age, sex, education, or BMI.\nInterestingly, we found that the association between IGFBP-2 was stronger for AD dementia than all-cause dementia. Adjusting for vascular risk factors, including diabetes mellitus, on multivariable analysis did not appreciably attenuate the association. In addition, we observed no cross-sectional association between plasma IGFBP-2 levels and measures of vascular brain injury, including WMHV or the presence of CBI. Indeed plasma IGFBP-2 levels have been shown to be inversely associated with plasma triglycerides 32 and risk of diabetes 33 and in our cohort, participants in the higher tertiles of IGFBP2, compared to the bottom tertile, had a lower prevalence of diabetes mellitus. Thus, vascular pathways are unlikely to account for the association we observed.\nIGFs have been reported to protect against hippocampal injury in the presence of ischemia and neurotoxins, including B-amyloid, 9, 34, 35 while elevated IGF-binding proteins are thought to inhibit these neuroprotective effects. [7] [8] [9] It has been suggested that ApoE4 may modify the association between impaired IGF signaling and dementia. 36 In our study, we found a similar prevalence of the ApoE4 allele across tertiles of IGFBP-2 levels. Furthermore, after adjusting for ApoE4 carrier status, the association between IGFBP-2 and dementia was not materially altered and we observed no evidence of effect modification according to ApoE4 carrier status, consistent with a prior study. 16 While elevated plasma IGFBP-2 levels have been cross-sectionally associated with smaller hippocampal volumes, this was only noted in individuals with a CSF biomarker profile inconsistent with AD (i.e. CSF A\u00df-422> 1.92 pg/mL). 11 In another study, elevated CSF IGFBP-2 was associated with increased CSF A\u00df-42. 16 Thus, ApoE4-mediated pathways do not appear to account for the observed association between elevated plasma IGFBP-2 and risk of dementia.\nElevated IGFBP-2 has also been linked to the development of tau pathology. 37 Both increased plasma and CSF IGFBP-2 levels have been associated with elevated CSF tau levels, 6, 7, 15, 37 which are likely mediated through impaired IGF signaling resulting in increased tau phosphorylation and reduced clearance of \u00df-amyloid. 18, 38, 39 IGFBP-2 has been shown to have differential cortical expression in transgenic mouse models of tauopathy compared to wild-type mice, further implicating a potential role for IGFBP-2 and subsequent impaired IGF signaling in the development of tauopathy and neuronal death. 37 We did not find an association between plasma IGFBP-2 levels and MRI structural brain measures, including hippocampal volume. There is limited published data on Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were defined at examination 7.

As mentioned, elevated plasma IGFBP-2 levels have been linked with lower hippocampal volumes, 11 while in transgenic mouse models, overexpression of IGFBP-2 was noted to be associated with lower total brain weight, as well as reduced hippocampal, prefrontal cortical, and cerebellar weights. 40, 41 Baseline CSF IGFBP-2 levels have also been longitudinally associated with atrophy in nonhippocampal regions including the parahippocampus, entorhinal cortex as well as inferior and superior temporal lobes. 37 We observed a cross-sectional association between elevated plasma IGFBP-2 levels and poorer performance on tests of abstract reasoning. There was no association with tests of other cognitive domains including visual memory, logical memory, visuospatial skills, or other executive function. One prior study found an association between elevated plasma IGFBP-2 levels and poorer performance on tests of episodic memory but not executive function. 11 Our analysis was cross-sectional so we are unable to comment on the possibility of a longitudinal association between IGFBP-2 levels and change in performance in other cognitive domains.\nCirculating IGFBP-2 offers promise as a candidate biomarker for predicting risk of dementia. On addition of IGFBP-2 to a conventional demographic and vascular risk factor model, the relative IDI index was 15% compared to the base model, suggesting that IGFBP-2 adds incremental value beyond that of traditional risk factors. Moreover, when we added plasma IGFBP-2 to the conventional model, 32% of individuals with dementia were correctly assigned a higher predicted risk while 8% of individuals without dementia were correctly assigned a lower predicted risk, indicating improved dementia risk classification.\nThere is increasing interest in manipulating insulin sensitivity and IGF signaling in the brain to help target cognitive decline and dementia. Evidence to date supports a role for insulin, and growth hormone-releasing hormone in improving cognitive performance in patients with mild cognitive impairment and AD dementia, [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] while administration of IGF-I and IGF-II in murine models has been related to improved cognitive performance and neurological function as well as reduced \u00df-amyloid burden in the brain. [47] [48] [49] [50] Blocking IGFBP-2 may be an attractive therapeutic target for dementia prevention by enhancing IGF signaling in the brain. Plasma IGFBP-2 may also be useful as a surrogate outcome in phase II trials of future dementia therapeutics targeting IGF signaling or for selecting suitable patients for inclusion in phase III trials of such therapies.\nThe unique strengths of our study include our relatively large sample size compared to prior studies to date, the high proportion of individuals with measured IGFBP-2 levels, the availability of prospective, long-term followup data in a population confirmed to be dementia-free at baseline, the rigorous approach to surveillance, and diagnosis of clinically confirmed dementia and AD (dementia diagnosis was confirmed based on clinical assessments, medical record review by a behavioral neurologist, and rigorous application of standardized criteria), and the detailed assessment and follow-up for development of vascular risk factors as well as intermediary cognitive and structural MRI brain measures. Limitations include the use of clinical criteria rather than biomarker-based data (e.g. CSF A\u00df-42 or amyloid positron emission tomography) for dementia diagnosis and subtyping.
