Lower and less frequent bPSi fluxes were observed during most of the warm anomaly period, reflecting a shift in phytoplankton community composition towards dominance of small-sized phytoplankton under warmer conditions. Lower FPC fluxes observed concurrently with the lower bPSi fluxes may indicate a decrease in fecal pellet production due to changing feeding conditions. In addition, the export of smaller fecal pellets in fall 2005 and spring 2006 suggests a dominance of smaller zooplankton during the warm anomaly. Nonetheless, bPSi and FPC export always increased in the presence of ice cover in the area above the sediment trap, even during the warm anomaly period, suggesting that sea ice is a key factor influencing the frequency of export events in the eastern Fram Strait. The scarcity of ice over the sampling area in 2005 and 2006 may partly be due to the warm anomaly, although solar radiation and ice drift due to wind stress also govern ice cover extent in the region. Overall, the warm anomaly resulted in a shift in the composition of the export fluxes when associated with an absence of ice cover in the eastern Fram Strait."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The HAUSGARTEN observatory, located in the eastern Fram Strait approximately 120 km west of Spitsbergen, has been maintained by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research for more than a decade, providing a unique long-term dataset for this region of the Arctic Ocean (Soltwedel et al., 2005) . During this period, a warming of the Atlantic Water entering the Arctic Ocean with the West Spitsbergen Current was recorded in Fram Strait (Beszczynska-M\u00f6ller et al., 2012) . The warmer period began in late 2004, reached a peak in September 2006, and persisted until a significant decrease in temperature was recorded in 2008 (Beszczynska-M\u00f6ller et al., 2012) . This period of increased water temperature was defined as the warm anomaly of [2005] [2006] [2007] , when temperature anomalies exceeding 1\u00b0C were observed in the eastern Fram Strait (Beszczynska-M\u00f6ller et al., 2012) . During this period, the highest mean temperature of the West Spitsbergen Current reached 4.4\u00b0C, whereas the median temperature of the Atlantic Water entering the Arctic Ocean in Fram Strait usually ranges from 3 to 3.5\u00b0C (Beszczynska-M\u00f6ller et al., 2012) . The coincident deployment of a long-term sediment trap at the central station of the HAUSGARTEN observatory before, during, and after that warm anomaly period provided the opportunity to evaluate the impact of an increase of water temperature on export fluxes in the entrance to the Arctic Ocean.\nSeveral studies have investigated the biological impact of warmer ocean conditions on marine ecosystems. In northern Chile, the high surface temperature anomaly observed during the El Ni\u00f1o episode of 1997-1998 led to lower phytoplankton biomass and primary production (Iriarte and Gonz\u00e1lez, 2004) , a dominance of small-sized phytoplankton (Escribano et al., 2004; Iriarte and Gonz\u00e1lez, 2004) , lower diatom export fluxes (Romero et al., 2001) , an increase in small-sized zooplankton (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2000a; Escribano et al., 2004) , and reduced export of particulate organic carbon (POC) (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2000b) . The 1997 The -1998 El Ni\u00f1o event also resulted in a substantial decrease in phytoplankton biomass and in a dominance of small-sized phytoplankton off Oregon (Corwith and Wheeler, 2002) and British Columbia (Harris et al., 2009) , as well as reduced phytoplankton biomass , lower zooplankton abundance, and a shift in zooplankton community composition off central California (Marinovic et al., 2002) . Similarly, anomalously warm ocean conditions off Washington in 2005 resulted in lower phytoplankton biomass, lower phytoplankton productivity, and dominance of small-sized phytoplankton (Kudela et al., 2006) . Each of these observations was made in an eastern boundary upwelling ecosystem where the anomalously warm surface conditions inhibited the upwelling of nutrient-rich waters, suggesting that the phytoplankton community, and indirectly the zooplankton community, were primarily influenced by nutrient limitation during the warm episodes (Kudela et al., 2006) . However, recent observations suggest that water temperature also has a direct impact on phytoplankton size and community structure. Mor\u00e1n et al. (2010) observed an increasing contribution of small cells to total phytoplankton biomass with higher water temperature in the North Atlantic Ocean, whereas Hilligs\u00f8e et al. (2011) reported an increase in the importance of small cells in the phytoplankton community and a decrease in zooplankton production with increasing temperature from a dataset acquired in all major ocean basins. Because the fate of particulate organic carbon in the euphotic zone depends on phytoplankton and zooplankton communities (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2000a, b) , changes in phytoplankton and zooplankton composition during a warm anomaly are reflected in the magnitude and composition of the export fluxes.\nIn contrast to warm anomalies inhibiting the main input of nutrients in eastern boundary upwelling ecosystems, it is unlikely that the warm anomaly episode of 2005-2007 affected nutrient concentrations in the eastern Fram Strait, although no measurements are available to support this assumption. The long-term measurements of export fluxes at the HAUSGARTEN observatory should therefore reflect the direct impact of an increase in temperature on phytoplankton and zooplankton composition in the eastern Fram Strait. In the present study, fluxes of POC, zooplankton fecal pellets and biogenic particulate silica (bPSi), a proxy for diatoms, were measured prior to, during, and after the anomalously warm conditions of [2005] [2006] [2007] to indirectly evaluate the impact of the warm anomaly on the pelagic system."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Remote sensing", "text": "Daily averaged sea ice concentration for the area above the sediment trap (78\u00b030-79\u00b030 N; 2\u00b030-6\u00b030 E) was obtained by analysis of Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) data provided by the National Snow and Ice Data Centre.

Sampling cups were filled with filtered seawater adjusted to a salinity of 40 with NaCl and poisoned with HgCl 2 (0.14% final solution) to preserve samples during deployment and after recovery.\nIn the laboratory, swimmers were removed with forceps and rinsed under a dissecting microscope and samples were split for different measurements. Triplicate subsamples for POC measurements were filtered on pre-weighed GF/F filters (pore size: 0.7 lm) pre-combusted at 500\u00b0C for 4 h. POC filters were soaked in 0.1 N HCl for removal of inorganic carbon and then dried at 60\u00b0C. POC measurements conducted on a CHN elemental analyzer were not corrected for dissolution of organic material in the sampling cups and should be considered as minimum values. Subsamples for bPSi were filtered on polycarbonate filters (pore size: 0.8 lm) and bPSi measurements were obtained by wet-alkaline digestion of the samples (von Bodungen et al., 1991) . Zooplankton fecal pellets were enumerated (5-700 pellets depending on the subsample) and measured using a dissecting scope. The length and width of each fecal pellet (broken or intact) were measured and pellet volumes were calculated according to the shape of the pellets. Cylindrical pellets were attributed to calanoid copepods and ellipsoidal pellets to appendicularians (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2000a) . Fecal pellet volumes were converted to fecal pellet carbon (FPC) using a volumetric carbon conversion factor of 0.057 mg C mm \u00c03 for copepod pellets and 0.042 mg C mm \u00c03 for appendicularian pellets Gonz\u00e1lez and Smetacek, 1994) . POC fluxes were averaged for each collection period (coefficient of variation <15%), while POC, bPSi, and FPC fluxes were converted to daily fluxes for each collection period. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to measure correlation between POC, bPSi, and FPC fluxes. A one-way analysis of variance was used to test for the effect of deployment periods on fecal pellet size."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Ice concentration and water temperature", "text": "Ice cover was frequently absent in the region above the sediment trap during the sampling period, and when present ice concentrations remained mostly <20%. Higher ice concentrations (>40%) were observed in June 2003 and in April, May, and June 2008 (Fig. 2a) . Sea surface temperature and water temperature at $50 and $250 m displayed seasonal variation, with low values measured in winter and spring and high temperatures observed in summer and fall ( Fig. 2b-d ). The highest water temperatures (4-5.5\u00b0C) were observed in September 2006 at all depths investigated, while the lowest temperatures (0.8-1.8\u00b0C) were measured in winter-spring 2003 at $50 m and $250 m and in spring 2008 at the sea surface. The study area was strongly influenced by Atlantic Water, as the Atlantic Water mass is defined as warmer than 2\u00b0C (Schlichtholz and Houssais, 2002; Beszczynska-M\u00f6ller et al., 2012) . The majority of fecal pellets exported every year were copepod pellets, although a higher proportion of appendicularian fecal pellets were exported during 2002-2003 and 2007-2008 (Fig. 2h) . The average volume and width of copepod and appendicularian fecal pellets collected in fall and spring/ summer were similar every deployment year except in 2005-2006 when the volume and width of exported fecal pellets were significantly lower than in all other years sampled (p < 0.05; Fig. 3 ). the area above the sediment trap likely triggered the onset of the diatom bloom, as ice melt typically promotes diatom blooms in the marginal ice zone by producing strongly stratified surface water (Peinert et al., 2001; Fortier et al., 2002; Sakshaug, 2004; Lalande et al., 2007) . Because zooplankton fecal pellets sink rapidly (Turner, 2002) , a pronounced increase in FPC fluxes 15 days after the increase in bPSi fluxes suggests that zooplankton biomass was low until it rapidly increased at the end of May, most likely indicating the seasonal ascent of copepods in the region. A similar increase in FPC fluxes was measured at the end of May by another sediment trap deployed at a distance of $5 km from the current sediment trap (Lalande et al., 2011) , supporting the hypothesis of the seasonal ontogenetic migration of copepods at the end of May in the eastern Fram Strait. The unusual increase in ice concentration at the beginning of June 2003 was attributed to the formation of a cyclonic eddy at the ice-edge, a recurrent feature in the eastern Fram Strait (Wadhams and Squire, 1983; Johannessen et al., 1987; Lalande et al., 2011) . In addition to distributing ice over an area of 30-40 km diameter for a 20-30 day period, the cyclonic motion of an ice-edge eddy transport warm Atlantic Water beneath the ice, creating an upwelling in the core of the eddy and downwelling on the outer edges (Johannessen et al., 1987; Niebauer and Smith, 1989) . The formation of the ice-edge eddy rapidly modified the composition of the POC flux in June 2003 and likely contributed to the rapid dominance of appendicularian fecal pellets in the FPC flux (Lalande et al., 2011) . Appendicularians were either advected with the Atlantic Water or were better adapted to take advantage of a rapid change in water mass and presumably phytoplankton composition due to their higher rates of ingestion than copepods (Hopcroft et al., 2005; Lalande et al., 2011) . In the present study, the FPC flux composition also shifted from a dominance of copepod pellets to a dominance of appendicularian pellets at the onset of the ice-edge eddy in the first week of June, providing further support to the hypothesis that mesoscale eddies can affect the composition of the POC flux over a large area."}, {"section_title": "Export fluxes", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "An abrupt and large increase in POC, bPSi and FPC fluxes was observed a few weeks after the beginning of the following deployment period at the end of July-beginning of August 2004. These elevated fluxes indicated the occurrence of a diatom bloom that was immediately grazed upon by zooplankton and contributed to a large export of POC before the onset of the warm anomaly period. This late summer bloom may have been the second bloom in 2004 as repeated blooms are a common feature during spring and summer in the marginal ice zone of Arctic seas (e.g. Arrigo and van Dijken, 2004; Richardson et al., 2005) . For example, Richardson et al. (2005) reported a Phaeocystis bloom in June and a diatom bloom in August in the Greenland Sea in 1999. Stratification from solar heating rather than from ice melt likely triggered a phytoplankton bloom earlier in the productive season in 2004, as ice was absent in the region for the complete spring and summer period. These results indicate that the presence of ice is not mandatory for the occurrence of a large POC export event in the eastern Fram Strait."}, {"section_title": "During the warm anomaly", "text": "A long period without a marked increase in bPSi fluxes coincided with the warm anomaly period that began in late 2004 and peaked in September 2006, reflecting a decrease in the export and probably in the production of diatoms with the increase in water temperature. In fact, phytoplankton fluxes obtained from 2000 to 2005 from the same long-term sediment trap time-series indicated that the abundance of diatoms declined considerably in 2005, leading to a dominance of coccolithophores in the last year of sampling (Bauerfeind et al., 2009) . Diatoms are cold water and ice-associated organisms, while coccolithophores such as Emiliania huxleyi are known to prefer warm waters (Tyrell and Merico, 2004) . E. huxleyi blooms occur during positive temperature anomalies in the Atlantic Water inflow to the southern Barents Sea (Smyth et al., 2004) , it is therefore likely that coccolithophore blooms were recurrent during the warm anomaly in the eastern Fram Strait. The lack of elevated bPSi fluxes from the start of the warm anomaly up to May 2007 concurs with the reduced importance of large phytoplankton cells caused by the high surface temperature anomaly observed during the El Ni\u00f1o episode of 1997-1998 off Chile (Escribano et al., 2004; Iriarte and Gonz\u00e1lez, 2004) , Oregon (Corwith and Wheeler, 2002) , and British Columbia (Harris et al., 2009) , as well as during the warm anomaly of 2005 off Washington (Kudela et al., 2006) . A shift from a dominance of large diatom cells to a dominance of small coccolithophore cells is also consistent with recent observations that rising water temperature favors the growth of small phytoplankton cells (Mor\u00e1n et al., 2010; Hilligs\u00f8e et al., 2011) .\nSimilarly to diatom fluxes, the export of fecal pellets remained low from the start of the warm anomaly up to May 2007, except for a short period at the end of September-beginning of October 2005 when FPC flux increased above 0.5 mg C m \u00c02 d \u00c01 and a simultaneous small increase in bPSi fluxes was observed. These increases in bPSi and FPC export were likely initiated by the advection of ice into the area during a few weeks, which may have caused sufficient ice melt to stratify warm surface waters and trigger diatom production. However, the rapid decline in sunlight at that time of year likely prevented the occurrence of a diatom bloom, and the increase in bPSi and FPC fluxes may instead be attributed to the rapid sedimentation of diatoms released from the melting sea ice and subsequently grazed upon by zooplankton (Michel et al., 1997) . This is supported by the observation of diatoms both as individual cells and inside fecal pellets during a period of elevated bPSi and FPC fluxes. Although calanoid copepods in the region normally descend for hibernation in July (Hirche, 1997; Hirche et al., 2006) , Svensen et al. (2011) reported that a large proportion of calanoid copepods of stage CIII were still present in surface waters of the eastern Fram Strait in September, possibly due to a second spawning or to the advection of a second generation with the Atlantic Water. The large proportion of copepods in total zooplankton biomass during September explains the increased copepod fecal pellet fluxes observed with increased bPSi fluxes during this period. Apart from this short period of increased fluxes, the low FPC fluxes observed during most of the warm anomaly period may reflect a decrease in fecal pellet production due to a decline in large diatom cells, which is in agreement with observations of reduced zooplankton production in warmer waters where phytoplankton cells are smaller (Hilligs\u00f8e et al., 2011) . Interestingly, the average volume of exported fecal pellets also decreased during the warm anomaly. Fecal pellet volumes were significantly lower in fall 2005 and spring/summer 2006 than in other periods sampled due to significantly smaller fecal pellet widths during these periods. The export of smaller pellets suggests that the proportion of small-sized zooplankton increased during the warm anomaly, similar to observations made off Chile during the 1997-1998 El Ni\u00f1o event (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2000a; Escribano et al., 2004) . This higher proportion of small-sized zooplankton may reflect a shift in the zooplankton community composition during the warm period, comparable to the increased abundance of warm water zooplankton species observed during the 1997-1998 El Ni\u00f1o event off central California (Marinovic et al., 2002) . In the eastern Fram Strait, a shift from the dominance of the copepod Calanus glacialis to a dominance of the smaller copepod Calanus finmarchicus is probable under warmer conditions, as C. finmarchicus is favored by higher temperature while water temperatures >5\u00b0C induce dormancy in C. glacialis (Hirche and Kosobokova, 2007) . The smaller copepod pellet size may therefore reflect a dominance of C. finmarchicus during the warm anomaly. However, because fecal pellet size also varies with food concentration and composition (Turner, 2002; Ploug et al., 2008) , the decrease in average fecal pellet sizes may instead have been caused by the near absence of large diatom cells during the 2005-2006 deployment period, and the cause for reduced fecal pellet sizes remains debatable. Because fecal pellet composition and size determine their sinking velocity (Ploug et al., 2008) , smaller fecal pellets have lower sinking rates and are more easily retained in the upper water column, further contributing to the reduction of FPC fluxes during the warm anomaly.\nAn increase in bPSi and FPC export was observed in May 2007 when the water temperature was still anomalously high. For the first time since the start of the warm anomaly, ice cover persisted in the region above the sediment trap during April and May, presumably producing sufficient stratification to cause a short diatom bloom, or potentially releasing diatom resting spores and diatom cells in the water column (Michel et al., 1997; R\u00f3 _ za\u0144 ska et al., 2008) . The increased bPSi and FPC fluxes in the presence of ice suggest that the absence of ice during the warm anomaly inhibited the export of diatoms and fecal pellets. A second increase in bPSi and FPC fluxes was observed before the end of the warm anomaly in September 2007 when ice was again present in the region, further stressing the importance of ice for the export of large phytoplankton cells and fecal pellets. Overall, the increased bPSi and FPC fluxes in May and September 2007 indicated that diatom and fecal pellet export returned to pre-anomaly conditions once ice cover was sufficient in the region, in accordance to the rapid recovery in phytoplankton size structure, biomass, and productivity observed following the onset of upwelling after the El Ni\u00f1o event (Iriarte and Gonz\u00e1lez, 2004; Kudela et al., 2006) ."}, {"section_title": "After the warm anomaly", "text": "An increase in ice concentration when water temperature declined in spring 2008 also resulted in an increase in bPSi, FPC, and POC fluxes in May 2008. Although the warm anomaly period was at that time over, the magnitude and duration of the increase in bPSi and FPC export were similar to those observed during the previous spring when the water temperature was still anomalously high, further suggesting that the presence of ice had a larger influence on export fluxes than water temperature. The increased ice concentration and proportion of appendicularian fecal pellets at the end of April-beginning of May and at the end of May suggest the onset of an ice-edge eddy when the ice edge moved southward over the sampling area, similar to the eddy observed in June 2003. Daily ice concentration maps from April to July 2008 showed the intermittent presence of an ice-edge eddy in the vicinity of the sediment trap (data not shown), further indicating that ice-edge eddies are recurrent features in the region."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and implications", "text": "Long-term measurements of export fluxes in the eastern Fram Strait revealed a decrease in the export of large diatom cells during the warm anomaly period of [2005] [2006] [2007] . This suggests that the shift from a dominance of diatoms to a dominance of coccolithophores observed in 2005 at the beginning of the warm anomaly probably persisted for the rest of the warm period (Bauerfeind et al., 2009) . Lower export fluxes of smaller zooplankton fecal pellets were also observed during the warm anomaly, either the result of the increase in water temperature inducing a shift in zooplankton community composition towards a dominance of smallsized zooplankton, or the effect of a shift in phytoplankton composition on grazing and fecal pellet production. These results are similar to the dominance of small-sized phytoplankton, lower diatom fluxes, and shift in zooplankton community composition observed during the 1997-1998 El Ni\u00f1o event (Escribano et al., 2004; Iriarte and Gonz\u00e1lez, 2004; Romero et al., 2001; Corwith and Wheeler, 2002; Harris et al., 2009 ). However, lower bPSi and FPC fluxes were not associated with reduced POC export in the eastern Fram Strait, as increases in POC fluxes were still observed during the warm anomaly. This indicates that the warm anomaly did not lead to intensified retention as expected by model predictions reported by Forest et al. (2010) , but rather to a change in the composition of the material exported, with a larger proportion of unidentified POC being exported during the warm anomaly.\nA few episodes of enhanced bPSi and FPC fluxes when sea ice was present during the warm anomaly indicated that the absence of ice cover was a key parameter inhibiting diatom and fecal pellet export in the eastern Fram Strait. The presence of ice cover promoted the export of bPSi, which subsequently increased FPC and POC fluxes and produced efficient export events, as is typical for diatom-dominated ecosystems (Boyd and Newton, 1999; Buesseler et al., 2007) . The strong correlation obtained between bPSi and FPC fluxes (r = 0.832, p < 0.01) confirms that the presence of diatoms promoted the export of fecal pellets. Conversely, the export of bPSi was also enhanced by the export of diatom cells encapsulated into fecal pellets through grazing, an export mechanism also observed off northern Spitsbergen and in the Antarctic Polar Front region (Andreassen et al., 1996; Dagg et al., 2003) . Overall, the rapid and frequent changes in the magnitude and composition of the export fluxes observed in the eastern Fram Strait confirm that long-term measurements are necessary to accurately monitor this changing ecosystem.\nIn addition to the 2005-2007 warm anomaly, another warm anomaly entered the Arctic Ocean through Fram Strait in 1999-2000, suggesting that these features are recurrent (BeszczynskaM\u00f6ller et al., 2012). Furthermore, the mean temperature of the Atlantic Water entering the Arctic Ocean increased at a rate of 0.06\u00b0C/year from 1997 to 2010, implying that further warming may be expected, should the trend continue (Beszczynska-M\u00f6ller et al., 2012) . This inflow of warmer Atlantic Water is likely to contribute to increased sea ice melting west and north of Svalbard, although ice cover extent in this region is also governed by solar radiation and ice drift due to wind stress (Walczowski and Piechura, 2011) . Indeed, higher southward ice drift velocities due to stronger geostrophic winds caused an increase in ice export in [2005] [2006] [2007] [2008] in the Fram Strait (Smedsrud et al., 2008; Smedsrud et al., 2011) . Therefore, whether or not the warm anomaly induced the decline in ice cover in [2005] [2006] , the reduced fluxes observed during this period represent changes to expect in Arctic ecosystems under warmer conditions. This could have important implications for benthic communities, as a change in the composition of the downward export of organic matter is likely to affect food supply to the benthic ecosystem (Klages et al., 2004; Wassmann et al., 2004; Grebmeier et al., 2006) ."}]
