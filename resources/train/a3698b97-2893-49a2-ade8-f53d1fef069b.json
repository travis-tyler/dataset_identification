[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "This paper examines the importance of surface geometry of hippocampus for the analysis of the Alzheimer's disease (AD). We propose a disease classification model, called the QC-SPHARM, for the early detection of AD.\nThe proposed QC-SPHARM can distinguish between normal control (NC) subjects and AD patients, as well as between amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients having high possibility progressing into AD and those who do not. Using the spherical harmonics (SPHARM) based registration, hippocampal surfaces segmented from the ADNI data are individually registered to a template surface constructed from the NC subjects using SPHARM. Local geometric distortions of the deformation from the template surface to each subject are quantified in terms of conformality distortions and curvatures distortions. The measurements are combined with the spher- * Corresponding author ical harmonics coefficients and the total volume change of the subject from the template. Afterwards, a t-test based feature selection method incorporating the bagging strategy is applied to extract those local regions having high discriminating power of the two classes. The disease diagnosis machine can therefore be built using the data under the Support Vector Machine (SVM) setting. Using 110 NC subjects and 110 AD patients from the ADNI database, the proposed algorithm achieves 85.2% testing accuracy on 80 random samples as testing subjects, with the incorporation of surface geometry in the classification machine. Using 20 aMCI patients who has advanced to AD during a two-year period and another 20 aMCI patients who remain non-AD for the next two years, the algorithm achieves 81.2% accuracy using 10 randomly picked subjects as testing data. Our proposed method is 6% \u2212 15% better than other classification models without the incorporation of surface geometry. The results demonstrate the advantages of using local geometric distortions as the discriminating criterion for early AD diagnosis."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Recent research show that the Alzheimer's disease (AD) population is growing rapidly due to the world-wide ageing problem [1, 2, 3, 4] . As an incurable disease, early detection is particularly crucial in the perspective of early intervention to slow down the progress of the disease. However, definite clinical diagnosis of AD in prodromal stage is merely impossible as significant symptoms in terms of memory impairment only shows in a late stage of the disease. More often, patients suffering from the prodromal stage of AD are clinically classified as amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). And the discovery that not all aMCI patients would progress to AD adds one another difficulty to an early diagnosis.\nFortunately, medical research proves that the brain structure would undergo specific and measurable deformation since early AD. As a result, analyzing the MR brain images provides a possible solution to a trustworthy early diagnosis. Over years, medical research has been carried out and different criteria to analyze the brain for the AD detection has been proposed. In particular, many reports conclude that the hippocampus (Hipp) is affected in the earliest stage of AD [5, 6, 7] . Since then, analyzing the hippocampal atrophy for early AD detection is deeply studied. Most research takes the relative volume change of Hipp as the main criteria for classifying AD from aMCI and normal control (NC) subjects, as supported by medical reports that Hipp atrophy is a common sign in AD progression [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] .\nThe discriminative power of Hipp volume in AD detection might be improved after considering more features on the Hipp surface [14, 15] .\nThe difficulty in utilizing other Hipp surface features lie on the fact that there is no recognizable biomarker on the Hipp surface [16] . It is thus hard to obtain a reliable surface correspondence. Nevertheless, Hipp is known to have a genus-0 topology, i.e. an object without holes. As such, by the theory of partial differential equation, the geometry of Hipp can be described by a sequence of functions called the spherical harmonics (SPHARM) [17] .\nEach member of the sequence describes certain global geometry of the corresponding Hipp. The correspondence between an Hipp an its corresponding sequence of SPHARM coefficients is unique up to an isometry. Therefore, utilizing the SPHARM coefficients for AD diagnosis has also be studied by a number of researchers [18, 19, 20, 21] . However, such approach fails to report an expectedly high classification accuracy. Not only numerical errors may occur due to bad meshing of the Hipp surface, the need to truncate the SPHARM sequence to lower order terms so as to improve the computational cost greatly limits the discrimative power of the method. Therefore, a better approach over the volumetric method and the SPHARM-based method is still in demand.\nIn this work, we propose the QC-SPHARM model to utilize the Hipp surface geometric distortion combined with other metrics including volume changes for early AD detection. Given a database of pre-labelled brain scan (.nii extension), we use the AccuBrain \u00ae [22] algorithm to segment the left Hipp volume from the data. The process is validated and edited by neuroscientists to ensure the segmentation accuracy. We then use the ITK-SNAP \u00ae [23] to extract the surface from the volume. To compare surfaces based on their surface geometry, a pertinent mean template surface plays an important role. In this work, we apply the SHREC scheme [24] (which is based on the SPHARM theory) to construct a mean template surface of all NC subjects.\nThe mean surface demonstrates the overall geometry a normal Hipp. Each Hipp is then registered to this mean surface using the SPHARM registration. The truncated SPHARM coefficients of each Hipp is imposed onto the mean surface accordingly. This results in a vertex-wise correspondence between each Hipp and hence the local geometric distortions of each Hipp from the mean surface at each vertex is studied. We measure the local geomet-ric distortions in terms of conformality distortions and curvatures distortions.\nCombining all these measurements result in a shape index which gives a complete description of the geometric distortions involved. That is, if the shape index of two Hipps are identical, then the two Hps are also identical up to a rigid motion. The shape index is then combined with the SPHARM and/or the volume distortion of the corresponding Hipp from the mean surface to form a feature vector. After applying a bagging strategy incorporating t-test algorithm to further enhance the discriminative power of it, the support vector machine (SVM) is used to build a machine to classify AD subjects from the others. Whenever a new (unlabelled) subject is present, by registering his segmented Hipp surface to the mean surface and then computing the shape index of it, the SVM machine can automatically label if the subject belongs to the AD class. The proposed framework is partly inspired by [25] . The proposed framework is tested with subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database 1 and the results are compared with other traditional models on the same dataset. It is evident that the proposed framework is accurate in classifying AD from normal control subjects, as well as detecting aMCI patients having a higher possibility of progressing into AD."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "There are two main aspects in AD diagnosis. On one hand, it is important to be able to detect AD subjects from those NC subjects. To validate the accuracy of the proposed model in this aspect, we collected a dataset consisting of 110 AD patients and 110 NC subjects from the ADNI database.\nOn the other hand, it is reported that aMCI is an intermediate stage in the progression of AD. Whether an aMCI patient would progress into AD is hence crucial for early AD diagnosis. The MCI-AD converter is defined when a subject's diagnostic status has advanced during the two-year period.\nWe use the aMCI-AD label to denote subjects who transitioned from MCI to 1 Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report.

Finally, the geometric measurements can be combined with other quantities such as the SPHARM coefficients and the relative Hipp volume to form a feature vector. For easier discussion, we elaborate the following discussions in reference to the dataset A, i.e. NC versus AD patients. Most steps can be followed directly by replacing NC subjects by aMCI-stable patients, and AD patients by aMCI-AD patients respectively.

The construction of a pertinent mean surface is crucial.\nIn our QC-SPHARM model, the first task is to construct a relevant mean surface and elaborate a mutual vertex-wise correspondences between subjects to facilitate comparison of local geometric distortions. In prior to this step, we need to improve the mesh quality in terms of triangulation regularity since it is a crucial factor to the accuracy of the registration. In this work, the mesh quality is improved by applying the Laplacian smoothing to each subject, followed by a mesh simplification step and then a a mesh refinement step to improve the vertex density of the surfaces. The edge lengths of the resultant meshes are less deviated. Fig. 2 demonstrates the sample surfaces as in Fig. 1 after the quality improvement process. \nwhereV i andF i is the vertex set and the face set ofM i respectively. To register between surfaces, we use the spherical harmonics (SPHARM) to establish fully automatic registration. Note that each Hipp surface must have a spherical topology. In the SPHARM theory [26] , there is a sequence of Fourier basis function\nnamed the spherical harmonics, that can completely describe any spherical object. In other words, each Hipp surfaceM i can be represented b\u0177\nfor eachv j i \u2208V i , where r m l,i is the 3-dimensional Fourier coefficients (called the SPHARM coefficients) ofM i corresponding to Y m l . The correspondence between eachM i and its spherical harmonics is unique. Each term in the RHS of equation (2) describes part of the geometry of the Hipp surface. It is noted that lower order terms describe more general geometry, and higher order terms describe some finer details of the surface geometry. While including higher order terms of {Y m l } can increase the discrimative power of the model, in practice it puts large burdens to the computational cost. Therefore, it is common to truncate the high order terms of {Y m l }. In particular, all the terms beyond order 31 are truncated in this work. Therefore, eachM i is approximated byv\nTo compare the geometry among Hipp surfaces in the database, a reference template surface is needed. In this work, the reference surface is chosen to be the mean surface M 0 of all the NC subjects, which is constructed as follows.\nFirstly, we apply the SHREC algorithm [24] on the collection of those NC subjects. The SHREC algorithm mutually aligns the underlying SPHARM parametrization {r m l,i } of each HP surface to give the parametrization {r m l } of the mean surface. For more details of the SHREC algorithm, readers are referred to [24] . After constructing the mean parametrization {r m l }, a template spherical mesh S 0 = (V 0 , F 0 ) is constructed to provide a triangulation to the mean surface. Hence, the mean surface\nfor each v j 0 \u2208 V 0 . In this work, the template mesh is constructed by N = 8, 000 vertices. Fig. 3 shows the spherical template mesh S 0 and the constructed mean surface M 0 for reference. It is noted that the meaning of creating a mean template surface is to demonstrate a normal Hipp surface of a healthy subject. Therefore, in manipulating with the dataset B, we still use the above mean surface (4) as the template reference surface in this step.\nAs for the mutual registration between surfaces, each registered surface "}, {"section_title": "Geometric measurements", "text": "From the registration step, the surface registration f i : To quantitatively measure the shape deformation, a vertex-wise shape index is designed using the conformality distortion and the curvatures distortions to analyze the geometric distortion of M 0 from M i .

In particular, the conformality distortion term \u00b5 detects the local geometric distortion in an infinitesimal scale. Examples of using the conformality distortion to aid detecting abnormal deformations can be found in [25, 27] . The shape index is a complete descriptor to measure the deformation of the Hipp surface. If E i shape = E j shape for any given \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, then the corresponding surfaces M i and M j are identical up to a rigid motion.\nIn the proposed QC-SPHARM model, we combine the shape index (6) with the SPHARM coefficients and the global volume distortion, such that the feature vector c i of each subject M i reads c i = (e i,1 , e i,2 , . . . , e i,N |r i,1 , r i,2 , . . . , r i,K |v i ),\nwhere e ij = e i,j = E i shape (v j ), r i,k = r ik is the collection of all SPHARM coefficients of M i in sequence, and v i is the global volume distortion of M i from the mean surface. Combining all the feature vectors gives the feature matrix C: To improve the stability of the t-test, the bagging strategy [28] is incorporated. Firstly, we rewrite the matrix C in the equation (9) by\nWe perform M independent iterations. In the i-th iteration, the i-th subject (i.e. the i-th row of C in equation (10)) is excluded. The classical t-test is performed on the remaining M \u2212 1 subjects to obtain a p-value p i j for each j-th feature. The M testes are combined by setting\nThe statistically significant regions can thus be extracted by the index set:\nwhere the j k 's are selected by the criterion p j k \u2264 p cut (13) in which p cut \u2208 (0, 1) is a global constant threshold parameter. In other words, the QC-SPHARM model extracts all the features having p-value less than or equal to p cut ."}, {"section_title": "The classification model", "text": "Once the statistical significant region \u2126 is extracted, the shape deformations at those statistical significant features can be analyzed and the classification model can be built.

In the proposed QC-SPHARM model, the SVM is employed to fit the data C. The SVM method finds the best hyperplane w\u00b7x\u2212b = 0 to separate the two classes. In practice, the algorithm solves the minimization problem:\nwhere y i is the class label for the i-th subject. In this work, we set y i = 1 for NC subjects and y i = \u22121 for AD subject.

The shape index is used as the Figure 6 : Variation in the classification accuracy (%) versus the change in threshold parameter p cut discriminating features on the surfaces and a t-test is applied to extract the vertices having high discriminating power. Lastly, a L 2 norm based metric is defined on the feature vector space to set up a discriminating criterion to classify each subject. Readers are referred to the paper for more details. It is noted that since there is no longitudinal data available for both database, we replace the surface correspondences elaborated in [25] by the SPHARM correspondences as mentioned in the last sections.\nIn the traditional Hipp-volume-based method, the subject is scanned multiple times in an interval of half year to one year. The Hipp volumetric data is segmented from the 3D image and the change in relative Hipp volume is recorded. Once a database of pre-labelled data is available, the mean of the Hipp volume change can be calculated for the NC class and for the AD class respectively. Labelling a new subject is therefore to check if the Hipp volume change is closer to the mean of the NC class or that of the AD class. How-ever, as for early AD diagnosis, it is undesirable to take multiple brain scans over long time before a diagnosis result is available. Instead, we compute relative Hipp volume by dividing the Hipp volume by the total brain mask volume. The relative volume should be small if the Hipp is shrinking, and thus is believed to be helpful to the classification.\nIn the SPHARM method, the SPHARM coefficients of the Hipp surface of each subject is used directly as the discriminating features. In particular, we use the SPHARM coefficients up to order l = 31, which corresponds to 961 terms in the equation (5) .
