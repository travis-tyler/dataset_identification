Based on the results of international surveys, for example, the TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study) and PISA (Program for International Student Assessment), in 2015, the TIMSS survey was conducted on class IV students while PISA was for students of class IX and class X (age 15 years) in schools randomly selected throughout Indonesia (Mullis at al., 2016) .\nThe results of the PISA survey, in 2012-2015, the achievement of mathematical competencies of Indonesian students increased significantly, but the overall achievement was still below the OECD average. In particular, more than 80% of students are only able to be at level 1, which is the lowest level in PISA assessment (OECD, 2016) . In other words, the level of mathematics mastery of students is not as expected. Furthermore, based on the TIMSS report, it is known that: a. Sixty-six percent of Indonesian students really like and feel enjoy with math. This number is greater than the International average (45%). b. The confidence in their mathematical abilities is only 23%. This percentage is relatively lower than the International average (32%) [2] . The description above shows that there are two real phenomena that occur until today. First, students' mastery of mathematics is an important factor. But the reality in the school shows different things. Mastery of material is not the only factor that influences the high or low achievement of student competencies. Indeed, students with good mastery of material have more tendency to obtain good results.\nThe second phenomenon is that many students like and feel enjoy with mathematics, but their confidence in their mathematical abilities is quite low. Self-confidence or individual perceptions of mathematical abilities are defined as Mathematics SelfEfficacy (Sukoco, et al., 2017) . This belief does not mean \"the individual believes in what he is going to do\" but rather \"the individual believes in what he is capable of\" (Sukoco & Mahmudi, 2016) . Therefore, MSE is an individual belief in dealing with various types of tests, ranging from understanding concepts to solving problems or mathematical problems.\nAccording to the OECD, MSE is closely related to performance in mathematics at almost every level of the participating countries. However, this is not the case for Indonesia, both based on PISA 2003 and PISA 2012. This means that in-depth research needs to be conducted regarding these results (Sukoco, et al., 2017) . Sukoco, et al. (2018) compiled the scale of the Mathematics Self-Efficacy for high school (Mathematics Self-Efficacy for Senior High School / MSESc) as a valid and reliable pilot project. As a follow-up, the MSESc scale was used to see the effect of MSE on the results of students' National Examinations of Mathematics (Sukoco, et al., 2017) . The findings are the positive influence of MSE on the results of the Mathematics National Exam. However, the contribution of MSE in influencing the results of the Mathematics National Exam is only 4.193% while the contribution of its covariates (TO Mathematics National Exam) is 95.807%.\nFurthermore, to see the effectiveness of the scale of MSESc, Sukoco & Kholifa continue the development of the scale of the Mathematics Self-Efficacy (MSE) for high school levels, the results of which are valid, reliable, and effective (Sukoco & Kholifa, 2016) . Furthermore, Bonne (2016) also found the importance of the influence of the Mathematics Self-Efficacy (MSE) on the achievement of students' mathematical competencies in New Zealand. However, the MSE instrument developed is computer based.\nAnother issue is the 2015 PISA survey which has been computerized except in 15 countries, one of which is Indonesia (OECD, 2016) . In addition, the written administration of the scale also creates its own constraints. For example, the possibility of entering data incorrectly. Therefore, the development of computer-based applications will facilitate the administration of scale and be able to reach a wider population so as to strengthen the results of previous studies, especially in Indonesia.\nBased on the descriptions above, it is necessary to develop a scale of computerbased Mathematics Self-Efficacy in Indonesia."}, {"section_title": "METHOD", "text": "This type of research is development research. The development design used in this study refers to the ADDIE development model by Reiser & Dempsey namely Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation (Reiser & Dempsey, 2007) . The development produced in this research is only in the analysis and design stage.\nThe application of this computer-based Mathematics Self-Efficacy scale is used to process student data retrieval without using paper or commonly known as a Computer Based Test (CBT) or Computer Assisted Test (CAT). All exam processes are done through computers, starting from the making of scale items, class arrangements, user settings that can fill the scale, teacher/user settings, to data retrieval processes using web technology. The type of scale used is Likert with 4 choices.\nThe specifications of this application are as follows. a. PHP with framework: Codeigniter versi 2.x.x; b. JQuery Javascript, to handle javascript commands, and others; c. JSON data format for exchanging data between server and client, on AJAX menus; d. Design UI with a CSS framework, Twitter Bootstrap.\nWhile for the user level the application can be divided into 3, namely: "}, {"section_title": "RESULT", "text": "The development result of computerbased Mathematics Self-Efficacy scale follows these steps."}, {"section_title": "Preparation of Local Files and Servers", "text": "The steps for preparing local files and servers are as follows. a.
