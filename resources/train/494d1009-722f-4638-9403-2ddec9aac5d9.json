[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "This report is intended to provide guidelines for assessing the magnitude and frequency of extreme coastal water level events in Washington State. We define extreme coastal water level events as those in which the height of the sea surface is unusually high (Figure 1). Sea level rise will push the reach of those extreme coastal water level events higher in elevation, and also increase their frequency. Selecting extreme coastal water level event scenarios is an important step in sea level rise visualization, planning and project design; this report is designed to facilitate that choice. Many processes, operating over a range of temporal and spatial scales, affect the height of the sea surface in coastal Washington State. Tides, wave run-up and storms lead to variations in coastal water level on time-scales of minutes, hours and days ( Figure 2). Variations in weather patterns and climate oscillations (e.g., El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation) can drive changes in coastal water level that last months to years (for more on these processes, see Appendix A). All of these processes vary around a multi-decadal rising trend in sea level that has been observed globally and in coastal Washington State over the past century (Miller et al. 2018). For the purposes of this report, we distinguish between extreme still water level (SWL) and extreme total water level (TWL). SWL is defined as the coastal water level due to all processes except wave run-up on the shoreline, whereas TWL is the maximum elevation that water reaches on the shoreline due to all processes including wave run-up. This distinction is necessary only because of the types of water level observations that are available in Washington State (see Box 1 for more detail). Extreme coastal water level events tend to occur in Washington when various processes coincide; for example, when storm surge (defined here as an increase in coastal water level in response to low pressure and wind; see Appendix A) co-occurs with a high tide. Several times a year, storm surge associated with a passing low atmospheric pressure can elevate the sea surface 1-4 feet above the predicted astronomical tide (i.e., Figure 2B).

The event in panel C had a much lower SWL than the event panel B, but a very similar flooding elevation and extent, illustrating the role that wave run-up can play in coastal flooding.

This is the water level measured by tide gauges, which are specifically designed to remove any water level components related to waves. \uf0b7 Total water level (TWL) refers to the maximum coastal water elevation on the shoreline, including waves and wave run-up. Where waves are present, the TWL will be higher than the SWL measured at a nearby tide gauge This distinction is useful only because of the observational data that we have available; SWL observations are readily available from Washington's network of tide gauges, whereas TWL is rarely measured directly and is challenging to model accurately. Periodically, high wind events in Puget Sound can generate waves that push water up the shoreline and lead to additional flooding or shoreline erosion (i.e., Figure 2C). On Washington's Pacific Coast and in parts of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, locally generated waves can co-occur with swell generated in distant parts of the Pacific Ocean, leading to infrequent but damaging large waves. The combination of these processes can lead to coastal flooding or other coastal impacts. The impacts of sea level rise in Washington State will likely be experienced initially as changes in the magnitude or frequency of extreme coastal water level events: New areas will be flooded during the most extreme events, and coastal areas already exposed to flooding will be impacted more frequently (Vitousek et al. 2017). Therefore, planning for sea level rise impacts requires understanding and accounting for changes in the magnitude and frequency of extreme coastal water level events. This assessment relies on a variety of published resources, along with our own analyses to provide insight about the magnitude and frequency of extreme coastal water level events, as well as expected changes as sea level rises. We also attempt to clarify the limitations and uncertainties of the information that we synthesize and highlight when or where additional study may be useful."}, {"section_title": "ESTIMATING FUTURE EXTREME WATER LEVEL", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Components of Extreme Water Level", "text": "Sea level rise will lead to increased flooding during future extreme water level events, sending water higher up the shoreline and further inland. We can conceptually understand extreme coastal water level events as being composed of the sum of various water level processes -tides, storm surge and wave run-up, for example -super-imposed on a changing mean sea level. We can therefore express possible extreme water levels during future events as a simple sum: Where relative SLR is a change in the average sea level at a particular location (Miller et al. 2018), astronomical tide height refers to the predicted water level driven by gravitational forces, storm surge is defined as an increase in coastal water level in response to low pressure and wind, and wave run-up is the additional elevation up the shoreline that water is pushed by waves. Additional insight about each of these components is provided in Appendix A. In this analysis, we assume that sea level rise is the most important driver of changing patterns of extreme coastal water level in Washington State. Put another way, existing research is inconclusive about if and how climate change will change the magnitude of storm surges affecting Washington State's coastline or if climate change will lead to significant changes in the magnitude of wave run-up (see Appendix A for a more detailed discussion). Regardless, future extreme water levels will reach higher up the shoreline because of the projected rise in sea level. To understand and develop extreme coastal water level event scenarios, each of the components (tides, storm surge, wave run-up) could be quantified and summed. However, doing so is complicated because we have to account for the likelihood that different combinations of tides, storm surge and wave run-up coincide. It is extremely rare, for example that a high tide occurs at the same time as a very large surge event, and even rarer that both occur at the same time as an exceptionally large wave event. As a result, these guidelines, where possible, summarizes extreme coastal water levels in a \"return frequency\" framework (see Box 2). Such a framework uses historical data or modelling to estimate the likelihood of various components coinciding to result in a particular extreme coastal water level."}, {"section_title": "Extreme Still Water Level", "text": "Still water level (SWL) is measured directly by tide gauges and incorporates the influence of astronomical tides, storm surges and other processes. SWL does not include the influence of wave run-up directly on the shoreline (see Box 1). We conducted an analysis of tide gauge data available for Washington State and calculated extreme still water level return frequencies for the Puget Sound/Strait of Juan de Fuca, and for the Pacific Coast of Washington (see Appendix B for analysis details). The results are shown in Table 1, along with how the magnitude of extreme still water levels are expected to change as sea level rises."}, {"section_title": "Box 2: Making Sense of Return Frequencies", "text": "Extreme coastal water levels can be described in terms of their return frequency, which is defined based on the probability that an event of a particular magnitude will be exceeded in any given year. For example, a \"2-year event\" is defined as the coastal water level associated with an event that we would expect, on average, at least once every two years (i.e., that has a 50% chance of exceedance in any given year). Similarly, the 100-year event is defined as the event that has a 1% chance of being exceeded in any given year. Knowing the return frequency of extreme coastal water levels at a particular location can provide useful insight for planning and design. For example, critical infrastructure that isn't flood tolerant should be placed well above any possible coastal extreme water level. Conversely, a more flood-tolerant shoreline use, parts of a coastal park for example, might be placed to avoid only the most frequent extreme coastal level.

Further analysis and modeling would be needed to more accurately estimate storm surge magnitudes in these embayments. "}, {"section_title": "Extreme Total Water Level on the Wave-exposed Pacific Coast", "text": "We also provide modelled estimates across a range of return frequencies for extreme total water level (TWL), though only for two locations on the wave-exposed Pacific Coast of Washington (Table 2). TWL during extreme events is difficult to model, can vary dramatically along the shoreline and is rarely measured directly. In particular, the slope, roughness characteristics, and orientation of the shoreline can substantially alter the magnitude of wave run-up (see Appendix A for more information). This means that estimates of wave run-up for one location, and the resulting TWL, may not be representative of other locations due to differences in shoreline characteristics and local variations in wave orientation and wave height. The extreme TWL magnitudes in Table 2 were calculated using a modification of the Serafin et al. 2017TWL model (see Appendix C for additional details), and were only generated for two wave-exposed locations on the Washington Coast. Additionally, the TWL magnitudes in There are limitations to our relatively simplistic modelling approach, and it is not intended to provide accurate estimates of TWL. Instead, our modelling is simply intended to answer an important question: Where in Washington's inland sea does wave run-up make a substantial contribution to extreme TWL patterns? Wave run-up can play a role in extreme events in Puget Sound almost anywhere (i.e., Figure 2C). However, throughout most of Puget Sound, waves are small enough, and rare enough, that they are unlikely to dramatically change the expected pattern of extreme water level at a particular return frequency. For example, we assessed the 100-year TWL for a location near Tacoma, Washington, and estimated it to be 3.6 feet relative to the local mean higher high water (MHHW) tidal datum (Van Arendonk, 2019), whereas the 100-year still water level (SWL) for Puget Sound is only a few inches lower at 3.2 feet relative to MHHW (Table 1). This difference is small-suggesting that for many planning and decision-making applications in this location using the SWL return frequency information in Table 1 would be adequate to characterize the coastal flood exposure. This is just one example, and other locations may see a more pronounced influence of wave run-up, necessitating additional customized analysis or modelling to quantify future coastal flood risks. To evaluate the relative importance of wave run-up throughout the inland sea of Washington State, we differenced our estimates of extreme SWL from Table 1 against our modelled TWL estimates ( Figure 3). Our estimates of the uncertainties in our relatively simple TWL approach (see Appendix D) suggest that in areas where the difference shown in Figure 3 is less than 2.5 feet, then the SWL extremes provided in Table 1 can generally be used to approximate coastal flood exposure for many applications. In areas where the difference shown in Figure 3 is larger than 2.5 feet, or anywhere where a user may want more insight about the potential current or future magnitude of extreme total water level events, a few options exist. First, sea level rise projections can be combined with a single event scenario, such as the \"Base Flood Elevation\" estimated by FEMA. For communities with updated regulatory flood maps (see https://www.fema.gov/coastal-flood-risk-study-process) the Base Flood Elevation for coastal areas provides a modelled estimate of the 100-year extreme TWL. Alternatively, users could evaluate water levels recorded during a single storm, such as a storm of record (i.e., an extreme event observed by a community), and use those as a storm scenario paired with sea level projections. If none of these options exist, or if additional information is required, then additional, customized, modeling and analysis may be needed to determine the height and extent of extreme TWL for a particular location."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Decision Tree", "text": "Sea level rise will increase the frequency or magnitude of extreme coastal water level events along Washington's coast. Coastal planners, or others interested in assessing the exposure of Washington's coast to flooding, need to select accurate and decision-relevant extreme coastal water level scenarios to combine with sea level projections. This report is intended to provide insight about the magnitude or frequency of current extreme coastal water level events, in order to facilitate the selection of scenarios that can be combined with sea level projections. Mapping this information can reveal the reach of future possible extreme coastal water level events and reveal existing exposure to this future risk (i.e., current infrastructure that may be placed in a future hazard zone), or land areas that may be unsuitable for particular uses due to their future flood risk. It is not always easy to estimate the reach of extreme events at any particular location In the meantime, however, we summarize available information for Washington's coast, and provide a variety of recommendations to support the selection of extreme coastal water level scenarios for Washington's Pacific Coast and the inland sea (Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca). Wading through this information and deciding on the best set of numbers for a particular location can be difficult. In order to facilitate these decisions we provide a decision tree ( Figure 4) intended to help users identify the best available information for their particular application and location "}, {"section_title": "Astronomical Tides", "text": "Coastal Washington State is subject to mixed semi-diurnal tides, in which there are two high tides and two low tides per lunar day (24 hours and 50 minutes), with strong diurnal inequality (i.e., the two high tides and two low tides may reach different elevations). These astronomical tides that occur on time-scales of hours to days are the largest driver of water level variability on the Pacific Northwest coastline. Washington State's coast is exposed to large tidal ranges. One measure of tidal range is the  pattern that influences tidal ranges and is discussed in more detail below. These longer cycles are particularly important in terms of understanding extreme coastal water levels; coastal flooding is more likely to occur when astronomical tides are highest. Higher-than-usual high tides can be expected, for example, during spring tidal cycles or during the peak of the 18.6-year lunar nodal cycle (Sanchez, 2018)."}, {"section_title": "Are astronomical tides sensitive to climate change?", "text": "Generally, astronomical tides are viewed as a uniform process that is independent of sea level rise (NRC, 2012); in other words, we assume that the same tidal pattern and range that we have today will continue into the future, independent of how sea level changes. This may not always be the case, however, since the propagation of tides are influenced by the depth of the water. Sea level rise, by changing the depth of water, may influence the patterns of tides in coastal areas (Idier et al., 2017). Pickering et al. (2017) modelled the effects of a change in sea level of 6.6 feet (2.0 m) on tides using a global tidal model. The authors found that sea level rise (SLR) caused changes in tidal range across the majority of coastal areas around the world. Although some of the differences simulated by the model were large-tidal range increased by over 2 feet in some parts of the globe-changes for Washington State were estimated to be less than a few inches. In addition, not all areas showed an increase in the height of high tide, and the results differed substantially based on assumptions made about the shape of the coastline. Although more modeling could clarify the implications for Washington State, this study suggests that the effect of sea level rise on tides can be treated as negligible for the region."}, {"section_title": "Storm Surge", "text": "Storm surge is a general term for the increase in coastal water level in response to low pressure and wind during storms. We define storm surge as any positive difference between the measured and predicted water level at a particular location ( Figure A.2). In coastal Washington, large storm surges are associated with passing low pressure systems, and therefore tend to last for hours or, at most, days. In Washington State, storm surge is unlikely to exceed 4 ft. on the outer coast and 3 ft. in Puget Sound-and is more commonly in the range of 1-2 ft ( Figure A.2). When a high astronomical tide co-occurs with a large storm surge, they can drive anomalously high water levels that could lead to coastal flooding."}, {"section_title": "Are storm surges sensitive to climate change?", "text": "Historical analyses are mixed in regards to identifying historic trends in storminess in the northeast Pacific Ocean; Graham and Diaz (2001), for example identified trends in storm activity that could lead to changes in patterns of storm surges, but couldn't attribute those patterns conclusively to climate change. Perhaps consistent with this analysis, the longest tide gauge record on the west coast (San Francisco) shows a possible increase in the largest storm surges in the record since 2050 (Bromirski et al., 2003), but an analogous analysis of the tide gauge record in Neah Bay, Washington did not replicate this result (Miller, 2013). Other analyses do not show any identifiable historical trends in storm frequency or wind intensity for the Pacific Northwest in particular (Rhein et al. 2013, Bylhouwer et al., 2013, and a longer-term  evaluation of storm patterns in the North Pacific found a possible decrease in pressure, but this change appeared to largely result from the 1976- (Favre and Gershunov, 2006).

In general, across Washington's coastal areas, average monthly water level in winter months is 0.5 to 1.0 feet higher than during the summer, primarily due to large-scale patterns of wind and ocean circulation. This elevated winter water level is cyclical and does not contribute to underlying changes in long-term average sea level, but does have an important consequence: Flooding nearly always occurs in the winter in coastal Washington (Sweet et al. 2014).  "}, {"section_title": "Patterns of multi-decadal variability in coastal water level", "text": "The lunar nodal cycle is an 18.6-year cycle that affects tidal range (but not average sea level), and is an example of a variety of processes that lead to variability in coastal water level at time-scales of multiple years. The lunar nodal cycle influences the range of tides and has the effect of making high tides marginally higher (by up to an average of ~0.6 feet in Seattle) during the peak of the cycle (Figure A.5). The 19.6 year lunar nodal cycle defines the averaging period, known as an epoch, for NOAA tidal datums, and also the averaging period for the sea level projections in Miller et al. 2018. Other potential sources of long-term (many years to decadal) coastal water level variability undoubtedly exist. For example, Bromirski et al. (2003) found multi-decadal cycles in patterns of storm surges measured in San Francisco. There are likely other large-scale influences that have yet to be identified.  "}, {"section_title": "Wave Run-up", "text": "Ocean surface waves are created by wind blowing across the surface of the water, and the height of surface waves are determined by three factors: (1) The magnitude or speed of the wind, (2) the duration of the wind, and (3) the distance over which the wind interacts with the water's surface (known as \"fetch\"). On Washington's Pacific Coast, waves can be generated by local wind or they can propagate as swell from distant parts of the Pacific and Southern oceans. Most of Puget Sound, by contrast, is only affected by waves generated by local winds, with much smaller maximum wave heights than are frequent along Washington's Pacific Coast (Yang et al. 2019a). Although waves are smaller in the relatively protected waters of Puget Sound, wave run-up can elevate the water level on the shoreline (i.e. Figure 2C on page 2). Waves also lead to other impacts (e.g., erosion) that are important to consider when assessing possible future shoreline conditions. When waves break, they are pushed up the shoreline by their own momentum. This is referred to as wave \"run-up,\" and it is included in our definition of total water level (TWL; see Box 2, page 6). In the presence of waves, TWL can be considerably higher than still water level (SWL). Wave run-up is a function of wave height and period and is also influenced by the slope, roughness and orientation of the shoreline relative to the waves. As a result, TWL can vary considerably from one location to the next, and also over time, since shorelines can grow or erode over time. As sea level rises, the base level upon which the various processes, including wave run-up, operate will rise with it. As a result, coastal flooding driven by extreme total water level will reach higher up the shoreline and occur more frequently than in the past."}, {"section_title": "Waves Characteristics on the Washington Coast and in the Inland Sea", "text": "Washington's Pacific Coast is known for its energetic wave climate. Winter storms in the northern Pacific Ocean can produce waves with heights exceeding 30 feet at least once per winter (Oct-Apr; Ruggiero et al., 2010, Yang et al., 2019b. As a consequence extreme total water level events can push water high up the shoreline, perhaps 13 to 14 feet above the current Mean Higher High Water tidal datum on parts of the wave-exposed Pacific Coast (Table 2, (Figure 2, page 2)."}, {"section_title": "Is wave run-up sensitive to climate change?", "text": "Recent analyses suggest that there may be trends in wave heights in the northeast Pacific that could influence patterns of TWL and flood exposure on Washington's Pacific coast (Ruggiero et al., 2013). Analysis of \"in situ\" measurements from the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC; Ruggiero et al. 2010, Seymour, 2011 and satellite altimetry (Young et al. 2011) suggest that over recent decades, there has been an increase in wave heights in the northeast Pacific Ocean. Other analyses have not corroborated that result; Seymour (2011) suggest that some or all of the trend that they identify in wave heights in the northeast Pacific Ocean may be due to climate variability, and Gemmrich et al. (2011)  Island. Erikson et al. (2015), though, did find that wave period is likely to increase across their study area, which could lead to changes in wave run-up and patterns of extreme TWL. In the wind-dominated wave climate of the inland sea of Washington State, potential changes in wind direction or magnitude may drive important changes in wind-driven waves. However, wind projections for the region do not show any systematic change in wind intensity (Salath\u00e9 et al. 2015). Some studies suggest that warming will result in a \"wavier\" (i.e., more variable) storm track in coastal Washington, but this is highly speculative, and it is unclear how this might affect wave heights or wave run-up (Barnes et al. 2013(Barnes et al. , 2015Pethoukov et al. 2013;Thomas, 2014). This is consistent with other analyses of climate model projections (e.g., IPCC, 2013), which show a very slight northward shift of about 1\u00b0 latitude in the average position of the North Pacific storm track; a small shift that would be unlikely to substantially alter wave patterns in the region. Many wave climate studies are based on relatively coarse wave and wind modeling. It is possible that local changes in wind speed and wave heights may be important especially in Puget Sound, but cannot be resolved at the scale of contemporary climate models. Observations from weather stations in coastal Washington show multi-year to decadal variations in mean wind direction of 5-10 degrees (VanArendonk, 2019) that have been shown to play a role in coastal change in other regions (Norcross et al. 2002). Additional research is needed to determine if waves influencing Washington's coast can be expected to change in the future, due to human-caused climate change, in a way that would change coastal flooding exposure."}, {"section_title": "APPENDIX B: TIDE GAUGE ANALYSIS AND RESULTS", "text": "Return frequencies for extreme still water level (SWL) were calculated for ten tide gauges in Washington State using a block maximum approach (Coles, 2001). We also included the tide gauge in Astoria, Oregon, in this analysis in order to better characterize and analyze extreme SWL patterns on the coast. A generalized extreme value distribution was fit to the highest water level recorded in each calendar year at each tide gauge. The extreme value distribution is described by three parameters; a \"shape\" parameter that characterizes the skewness of the distribution, a \"scale\" parameter describes the width of the distribution, and a \"location\" parameter that characterizes the magnitude of the extreme values. These three parameters were calculated for the annual maximum water level from each tide gauge (Table B.1), along with an estimate of their confidence intervals using the gevfit function in MATLAB. Based on a visual analysis of the results, we concluded that the coastal waters of Washington State could be divided into two geographies, each where a different extreme SWL pattern predominates. We inferred that the tide gauges in Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca share a generalized extreme value distribution, and those on the coast share a second distinct distribution (Table B.1). The data suggest that the Pacific Coast of Washington is subject to higher magnitude extreme SWL events than Puget Sound, relative to the local Mean Higher High Water tidal datum. There is much greater variability for coastal tide stations, though (for the location parameter in particular, see Table B.1), and while this may suggest an additional distinct extreme SWL regime on the coast, we believe that the observed differences are likely due the small sample size resulting from relatively short water level records. We developed a synthetic average generalized extreme value distribution for the coast and a separate one for Puget Sound by averaging each of the three parameters, using a weighted averaging approach, in which parameters with smaller confidence intervals were assigned more weight in the averaging process. We then calculated synthetic extreme SWL return frequency curves using these average parameters (presented in Table B.2 below, and on Table 1 on page 7). We argue that, based on the available evidence, there is enough similarity within these regions to apply these averaged return frequency curves to the selection of extreme SWL in vulnerability assessments. It is important to note that these are averaged; applications of these estimates to certain questions may demand additional accuracy or precision and require customized analyses (see Box 3, page 8). Based on this finding, we used the results of our analysis to create regionally averaged return frequency information for extreme SWL (Table B.2). Although an approximation, these statistics permit a quick assessment of likely extreme water levels in locations without tide gauges. APPENDIX C: TOTAL WATER LEVEL ESTIMATES FOR WASHINGTON'S WAVE-EXPOSED COAST Still water level (SWL) is only part of the story when it comes to understanding coastal flood exposure. Wave run-up can also push water up the shoreline and contribute to flooding (see Box 2, page 6). Coastal Washington only has a handful of wave buoys, and only one of those has operated within Washington's inland sea with sufficient time to test wave models ( Figure C.1). Direct observations of wave run-up on shorelines are nearly non-existent. As a consequence, total water level (TWL) is typically modelled, and in places where wave data are limited, wave heights themselves must be modelled. Serafin et al. (2017) derived TWL for the Pacific Coast of Washington State using water level records from tide gauges and a database of deep-water wave simulations (Perez et al., 2017 TWL estimates may have large uncertainties when applied at the site level. Most importantly, there can be considerable variability in TWL from location to location, driven by variations in the slope and surface characteristics of the shoreline (Serafin et al., 2017). In order to get some additional insight about the magnitude of extreme TWL for the two available study locations, we modified the Serafin et al. (2017) TWL model to include a more realistic beach slope for Washington, changing the West Coast representative average beach slope of 0.05 that they applied in their study to 0.02 based on data from Ruggiero et al. (2012). The resulting extreme TWL estimates for Washington's wave-exposed Pacific Coast are shown in Table 2 (found on page 9). How accurate are these extreme total water level estimates for the wave-exposed coast of Washington? There are no validation data to compare them to, but the highest magnitude TWL for the wave-exposed Washington Coast shown in In the absence of improved high resolution modelling of TWL, the information in Table 2 can provide useful insight about the potential reach of current and future storms when combined with higher sea levels on the wave-exposed Pacific Coast of Washington State. An important caveat to these results is that they do not apply to coastal communities in embayments (e.g., inside Grays Harbor or Willapa Bay). These communities are not subject to the high-energy wave climate of the open coast. As a result, the TWL magnitudes described in Table 2 are not suitable for coastal flood exposure assessments in those locations."}, {"section_title": "APPENDIX D: MODELLED WAVE RUN-UP ESTIMATES FOR PUGET SOUND", "text": "Wave run-up can play an important role in coastal flooding-even in the relatively calm waters of Puget Sound (Figure 2c, page 2). In Puget Sound, the intricate network of fjords, islands, embayments and land topography influences wind and waves in complex ways, limiting fetch in some locations and enhancing wind effects in others. Combined with a general lack of wave measurements in Puget Sound ( Figure C.1), this means that observationally based estimates of wave exposure are very limited in Puget Sound. While Puget Sound is generally characterized as a low-wave-energy or semi-protected environment (Finlayson, 2006), extreme storm events that pass over Washington annually bring intense low-pressure systems and associated high winds, even occasionally reaching hurricane strength (>74 mph). These temporarily turn Puget Sound into a high-energy wave environment (Mass & Dotson, 2010). For this project, we used a modelling approach to provide some insight about the potential magnitude of wave run-up on the shoreline during the most extreme events. Historically, this type of wave and total water level (TWL) modelling is expensive and time consuming, but is becoming more accessible. FEMA, for example, models the TWL for a storm with an average return frequency of 100 years as part of their coastal flood study process (Northwest Hydraulic Consultants, Inc., 2005). However, there can be potentially large uncertainties in modelling approaches for estimating flood magnitudes (Wing et al., 2018). For example, TWL is a function, in part, of the specific topography and sediment type at a shoreline location, which often are not known or incorporated into models. The resolution of wind forcing inputs may also contribute to the uncertainties of modeling waves in Puget Sound, especially under storm conditions (Yang et al., 2019a)."}, {"section_title": "Model Description", "text": "The wave model for this project was created using SWAN, (Simulating WAves Nearshore), which is a third-generation wave model developed at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. SWAN is a phase-averaged wave model commonly applied in coastal settings. It incorporates the processes of white-capping, shoaling, refraction, wind growth and dissipation, and bottom dissipation in the computation of waves (Booij et al., 1999;. Two nested SWAN model domains were generated for this project following the regional modeling approach of the USGS Coastal Storm Modeling System (Figure D.1;O'Neill et al., 2018;Erikson et al., 2018). These domains consisted of a large curvilinear grid covering the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the San Juan Islands, Northern Puget Sound and the Strait of Georgia and a smaller curvilinear grid covering the remaining area of south Puget Sound and Hood Canal. The SWAN models have spatially varying grid size resolutions ranging from ~200 feet close to shore and up to 1000 feet in deep water, where higher resolution is less important for modeling wave processes. For this project, waves were modeled using a look-up table (LUT) approach, following a similar framework described by Erikson et al. (2018). The LUT, in this case, was used to relate offshore water levels and over-water wind speed and direction to wave parameters at each model grid point across the Salish Sea. Given the high computational requirements needed to simulate an entire time series of spatially varying meteorological forcing in SWAN, a LUT provides an efficient alternative modeling strategy. This approach, however, focuses only on waves generated by local winds; in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, swell can be important (Yang et al., 2019a) Time-series of tide levels and meteorological conditions are used to query the LUT and generate hindcasts of wave parameters across the Salish Sea. Wind fields from a historical simulation produced using the Weather Research and Forecasting mesoscale model (WRF; Skamarock et al., 2008), a 6-hourly 12-kilometer resolution weather product covering the Pacific Northwest, provided the meteorological forcing needed for this project. The WRF simulation was forced with NCEP/NCAR's Reanalysis-1 product (Kalnay et al., 1996), which optimally incorporates weather observations from a wide array of sources into a single best estimate of global atmospheric conditions at each 6-hour time step (NCEP, 2018;Dee et al., 2016). Historic water level information from the Puget Sound NOAA tide gauges supplied the necessary water level time series. NOAA's tide gauge records provide historic water levels that incorporate the astronomical tide levels as well as any non-tidal residual such as storm surge. These components are all included when developing wave hindcasts with a LUT even though they are not dynamically modeled in SWAN. The end product of each LUT is a concurrent time series of water level, wave height and wave period, which is used as the boundary forcing for the next phase of modeling wave run-up. In Puget Sound, short period waves are the main driver of run-up on beaches, and beach slope and substrate type vary considerably more than on the open ocean coast. Given the complex nature of Puget Sound beaches, lower energy wave climate and prevalent shoreline armoring, we chose to use the Technical Advisory Committee for Water Retaining Structures (TAW) method (Van der Meer, 2002) for estimating wave run-up in this study. TAW is a Dutch model developed for engineering purposes, which specifically estimates the prescribed beach slope and bed roughness (a value quantifying the friction of the beach face; Van der Meer, 2002). The 2 percent wave run-up is the elevation of wave run-up that 2 percent of incoming incident waves will reach or exceed. For Irribarren numbers less then 1.8 the following expression was used: where: In situations where the Irribarren number exceeded 1.8, an alternative expression was used to estimate 2 percent wave run-up: 2% = * * * * (4.0 \u2212 1.5 ) (E.4) Reliable and up-to-date elevation data of the nearshore in Puget Sound is often lacking. In addition, there are data quality concerns with existing elevations: Artifacts in slope derived from interpolated gaps in the data, bias associated with the water surface in lidar, etc. It was beyond the scope of this project to contend with these issues. Instead, we used representative values of slope and roughness in the wave run-up expressions above; Finlayson (2006) showed that Puget Sound beach slopes range from 0.01 to 3.2; we used a uniform slope of 0.2 representative of many steeper stretches of beach in urban areas and revetments. We used a coefficient of roughness of 0.8, characteristic of coarse sediment and armor rock (Van der Meer, 2002), which is common to many Puget Sound beaches. To compute wave run-up, we extracted the annual maximum wave height and associated period from SWAN grid points every 328 feet (100 meters) along the shore, following the 32 foot (10 meter) depth contour, chosen because at this depth waves should remain unaffected by bathymetry. For each of these locations, the wave parameters were used as input to equations E.1 or E.4, E.2, and E.3 to estimate wave run-up. Waves were assumed to be approaching at a perpendicular angle to the shoreline, meaning that the term \u03b3 \u03b2 could be ignored. The presence of a berm was also neglected, incorporating only the reduction factor , the influence of bed roughness, when calculating wave run-up. On each profile consisting of a uniform slope of 0.2, the height above an arbitrary initial water level (zero in this case) was estimated based on the offshore annual maximum wave height and period. An estimate of total water level was arrived at for every grid point and every time step in the model domain, and every model time-step by querying the closest NOAA tide gauge to the grid point for an observed still water level relative to MHHW, and coupling that with the modelled wave run-up estimate. Because of the simplifying assumptions employed in this analysis, both in the estimation of wave run-up, and in the estimate of still water level, we do not expect that our total water level estimates are accurate enough for planning purposes, but uncertainties were not explicitly quantified. Full details of the analysis are available in Van Arendonck (2019)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "For every location in the model domain, we summarized the modelled time-series of significant wave height by averaging the maximum wave heights from each year at every location ( Figure D.2). Significant wave height is defined as four times the standard deviation of the instantaneous water surface elevation measured by a wave sensor. Not surprisingly, given the complex shoreline and topographic variability in Puget Sound, annual maximum significant wave heights vary considerably. The protected embayments of south, central and northern Puget Sound generally experience the smallest waves, ranging from 1 to 3 feet ( Figure D.2). In contrast, estimates are always larger than the significant wave height estimates in Figure D.2. The largest wave run-up is in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the west slope of Whidbey Island, and the southwest-facing shorelines of the San Juan Islands (Figure D.3). The smallest wave runup occurs in the protected embayments within Puget Sound, where wave heights are small ( Figure D.3) Our project estimates of total water level in Puget Sound are uncertain, but were used to evaluate locations in the inland sea of Washington State where wave run-up contributes significantly to existing and future patterns of coastal flood exposure. An approximate TWL was be estimated by coupling wave run-up estimates with observed water level data from the closest NOAA tide gauge in the model domain. We then calculated an annual average maximum TWL, roughly approximating a recurrence interval of two years (see Box 2, page 6). Results are shown in Figure 3 (page 12 of the main body of the report)."}]
