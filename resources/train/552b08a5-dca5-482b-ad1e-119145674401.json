However, the relative influence of specific and global connectivity and their differential impact on the three main neuroimaging biomarkers of the disease (atrophy, hypometabolism and amyloid-b deposition) have never been investigated to date. Forty-two healthy elderly subjects and 35 amyloid-b positive amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease patients underwent resting-state functional MRI, anatomical T 1 -weighted MRI, 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET and florbetapir-PET scans. All patients also underwent follow-up T 1 -weighted MRI, 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET and florbetapir-PET scans 18 months later to assess the lesion propagation. The epicentre was defined per modality as the most altered region at baseline in patients compared to controls. Maps of global and specific functional connectivity were computed from the resting-state functional MRI data of the healthy elderly subjects. Global connectivity corresponds to the connectivity strength of each grey matter area with the rest of the brain (i.e. all other grey matter areas) while specific connectivity refers to the connectivity of a single specific brain region (the epicentre) with the rest of the brain (i.e. all other brain regions). Maps of baseline alterations and propagation were computed for grey matter atrophy, hypometabolism and amyloid-b deposition in patients. Regression analyses were performed across the 239 brain regions to assess the links between global or specific functional connectivity in healthy elderly subjects and Alzheimer's disease-related baseline disruptions or alteration propagation. Atrophy at baseline was predicted by specific connectivity and inversely correlated with global connectivity, while hypometabolism and amyloid-b deposition were positively influenced by both global and specific connectivity. Regarding longitudinal changes, atrophy spread in regions with high specific connectivity while hypometabolism propagated in areas showing high global connectivity. This is the first study to show that global connectivity has an opposite relationship with atrophy versus hypometabolism and amyloid-b deposition, suggesting that the high level of functional connectivity found in hubs exerts a differential influence on these Alzheimer's disease lesions. These results sustain the hypotheses of higher vulnerability of hubs to hypometabolism and amyloid-b deposition versus transneuronal propagation of atrophy from the epicentre to connected regions, in Alzheimer's disease. Global and specific connectivity exert a differential influence on, and provide complementary information to predict, the topography of Alzheimer's disease lesions and their propagation."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease is the most widespread neurodegenerative disease in the elderly population. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive performances typically predominated by episodic memory deficits. The abnormal accumulation of tau-rich neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid-b deposition plaques are both neuropathological hallmarks of the disease. In vivo neuroimaging biomarkers of the disease include atrophy (predominantly in the hippocampus and temporal neocortex), hypometabolism (mainly in the posterior cingulate and temporoparietal cortex), and amyloid-b deposition in medial frontal, parietal and temporoparietal cortical areas (McKhann et al., 2011; Winblad et al., 2016) .\nRecent evidence from neuroimaging studies has shown that neurodegenerative diseases in general, and Alzheimer's disease in particular, target specific brain networks, leading to the network degeneration hypothesis (Buckner et al., 2005; Du et al., 2007; Sorg et al., 2007; Seeley et al., 2009; La Joie et al., 2014) . Thus, different mathematical modelling approaches have been developed to assess the relationship between healthy brain networks and connectivity on the one hand, and the topography and spread of lesions in dementia on the other hand (Seeley et al., 2009; Raj et al., 2012) . More specifically, these studies applied graph theoretical analysis to resting-state functional MRI or diffusion tensor imaging data and showed that the pattern of atrophy or hypometabolismand their propagation-could be predicted based on functional and/or structural connectivity (Raj et al., 2012 (Raj et al., , 2015 Zhou et al., 2012; Crossley et al., 2014) .\nTwo possible mechanisms might explain the fact that the topography and propagation of lesions are constrained or influenced by brain networks. First, it has been proposed that the most metabolically active brain regions, those with the highest level of neuronal activity and 'global connectivity' with the rest of the brain, defined as network 'hubs', are more vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease pathology (Buckner et al., 2009; van den Heuvel and Sporns, 2013) . This hub vulnerability hypothesis might notably explain the similarity between the topography of hubs and that of Alzheimer's disease lesions (Buckner et al., 2005) . It is further supported by evidences from neuroimaging studies showing a relationship between the level of global connectivity in healthy adults and the level of amyloid-b deposition (Buckner et al., 2005) .\nAlternatively, the fact that lesions are preferentially confined within brain networks might reflect their transneuronal propagation. Thus Alzheimer's disease lesions are thought to propagate neuron-to-neuron through prion-like mechanisms. This view is supported by neuropathological evidence that numerous disease proteins, as a-synuclein, amyloid-b, tau and TDP-43, have the capacity to misfold and propagate via trans-synaptic spread (Frost and Diamond, 2009; Palop and Mucke, 2010; Jucker and Walker, 2013) . This transneuronal spread hypothesis implies that the brain areas the most connected to the initial site of disruption (called as the 'epicentre') are more likely to be progressively involved compared to those less connected to the epicentre. Neuroimaging evidence using connectivity ring or graph theoretical analyses from diffusion tensor imaging or resting-state functional MRI data support this hypothesis by showing a link between the regions connected to the epicentre and the topography or propagation of lesions as reflected in atrophy or hypometabolism (Seeley et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2012; Mallio et al., 2015; Raj et al., 2015) .\nIn this paper, the term 'global connectivity' corresponds to the connectivity strength of each grey matter area with the rest of the brain (i.e. all other grey matter areas) and is also referred to as the weighted degree of a region with the rest of the brain in other papers (Buckner et al., 2009; Cole et al., 2010 Cole et al., , 2012 Rubinov and Sporns, 2010) . Regions showing high global connectivity generally correspond to hubs, although a more complete definition of hubs also integrate other criteria such as node degree, centrality, participation coefficient, etc. By contrast, the term 'specific connectivity' refers to the connectivity of a single specific brain region (the epicentre) with the rest of the brain (i.e. all other brain regions).\nBoth global and specific functional connectivity are thus thought to influence the topography and propagation of Alzheimer's disease-related brain alterations, respectively, via hub vulnerability and transneuronal spread. To our knowledge, only one previous study assessed both connectivity processes to predict atrophy in dementia (Zhou et al., 2012) and highlighted the contribution of both. However, the respective involvement of each of these two factors on the different Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging biomarkers has never been assessed to date.\nThe aim of the present study was to estimate the relative contribution of global and specific functional connectivity, measured in healthy elderly subjects, to predict Alzheimer's disease baseline atrophy, hypometabolism and amyloid-b deposition as well as their propagation over 18 months in amyloid-b positive mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease patients. We expected to show a differential influence of these two connectivity measures on Alzheimer's disease lesions. We hypothesized that atrophy would be mostly influenced by specific connectivity as a reflection of intraneuronal tau propagation while the high activity level in hubs would make them more vulnerable to amyloid-b pathology and hypometabolism."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": "An overview of the data processing and analyses is represented in Fig. 1 and in Supplementary Table 1 . First, values for specific and global functional connectivity were determined in 239 grey matter areas using functional connectivity data from healthy elderly subjects (Fig. 1A) . Thus, the value in the grey matter area reflected the mean connectivity value across all healthy controls. Second, values of baseline and propagation of atrophy, hypometabolism and amyloid-b were obtained in Figure 1 Overall schematic representation of data processing and analyses. Healthy elderly subjects and patients underwent anatomical MRI, 18 F-FDG-PET and florbetapir-PET at baseline to assess baseline disruption in patients (W-scores) (B Steps 1 and 2) and only patients underwent the same exams at follow-up (18 months later) to assess propagation of atrophy, hypometabolism and amyloid-b (Ab) deposition (B Steps 1' and 2'). All data values were extracted in the 239 regions of the Power atlas (B Steps 3 and 3'). Healthy elderly subjects underwent resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) from which the mean time course signal was extracted at the individual level in each of the 239 grey matter areas (A Step 5) and used to compute 239 \u00c2 239 correlation matrices of Pearson's correlation coefficients between all possible connections of node pairs. A Fisher's z transform was then applied to each individual correlation connectivity matrix (A Step 6). The three regions of the Power atlas showing the most significant alteration at baseline (W-scores) were isolated as epicentres (A Step 4) of atrophy, hypometabolism or amyloid-b deposition respectively. The specific connectivity of these three epicentres (with the 238 other regions of the Power atlas) corresponded to the group-level mean of the correlation coefficients between each epicentre and the other Power's regions (A Step 7'). For global connectivity, a one sample t-test was performed on the individual Fisher's z transformed matrices, and thresholded at P FWE 5 0.05 (A Step 7), resulting in one 239 \u00c2 239 matrix of t-values. For each of the 239 regions of the Power atlas, the global connectivity value corresponded to the sum of the t-values across brain regions (i.e. per column) that was then standardized (A Step 8). Correlation and regression analyses were carried out to assess the relationships between global or specific connectivity and baseline or propagation of atrophy, hypometabolism or amyloidb deposition (C).\nthe same 239 grey matter areas using data in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease patients (versus healthy elderly subjects for baseline data as they were expressed in W-scores) (Fig. 1B) . Thus, the value in the grey matter area reflected the mean value of atrophy, hypometabolism or amyloid-b deposition across all patients. Third, correlation and regression analyses were assessed, across the 239 grey matter areas, between the two kinds of measures mentioned above i.e. measures of connectivity versus measures of brain alterations (atrophy, hypometabolism and amyloid-b deposition) (Fig. 1C) . This led to a single r/p value per condition (per correlation), reflecting the strength of the correlation between (global or specific) connectivity measures in healthy elderly subjects and brain alterations (atrophy, hypometabolism and amyloid-b deposition at baseline and their propagation) in patients."}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Seventy-seven right-handed native French-speaking participants from the 'Imagerie Multimodale de la Maladie d'Alzheimer \u00e0 un stade Pr\u00e9coce' (IMAP) Study (Caen) were included in the present study: 42 healthy elderly subjects, 14 amnestic patients with mild cognitive impairment and 21 patients with Alzheimer's disease.

In the present study we used baseline MRI scans of all participants and follow-up scans at 18 months in patients.\nAt baseline, resting-state functional volumes were obtained in healthy elderly subjects using an interleaved 2D T 2 * SENSE EPI sequence designed to reduce geometric distortions using parallel imaging, short echo time, and small voxels (2D-T2*-FFE-EPI axial, SENSE = 2; repetition time = 2382 ms; echo time = 30 ms; flip angle = 80\n; 42 slices with no gap; slice thickness = 2.8 mm; field of view = 224 \u00c2 224 mm 2 ; in plane resolution = 2.8 \u00c2 2.8 mm 2 ; 280 volumes, acquisition time = 11.5 min).

Values of Jacobian rates less than zero indicate contraction (over time), whereas values greater than zero indicate expansion (Ashburner et al., 2016) . The anatomical MRI average was segmented into grey matter, white matter and CSF. The resulting grey matter segment (reflecting an average grey matter density probability map) was then (i) multiplied by the Jacobian rates resulting in the grey matter change map (reflecting a map of grey matter probability changes between baseline and follow-up); and (ii) normalized to the DARTEL template; the resulting deformation field was then applied to the grey matter change map. The normalized grey matter change map, smoothed with an 8 mm full-width at half-maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel, was used as a reflect of atrophy propagation over the 18-month follow-up period for each subject (Fig. 1B, Step 1' and Supplementary Fig. 1) . At the group level, a one sample ttest masked by the DARTEL grey matter mask was performed on the atrophy propagation maps of all patients (Fig. 1B, Step 2').\nTo assess propagation of hypometabolism or amyloid-b deposition, PET per cent annual change maps of 18 F-FDG and florbetapir were computed (Fig. 1B, Step 1') as described in Fouquet et al.

These results support the hypothesis of higher vulnerability of hubs according to which Alzheimer's disease pathology would preferentially occurs or accumulates in brain areas with high level of neuronal and metabolic activity, i.e. highly connected network hubs (Drzezga et al., 2011) . These network hubs typically involve multimodal brain regions including components of the default mode network and the cognitive control system such as the medial frontal and parietal areas and temporo-parietal regions (Buckner et al., 2009; Cole et al., 2010; Tomasi and Volkow, 2011; Jagust and Mormino, 2012) . The higher vulnerability of hubs might reflect the fact that protracted exposure to upregulation of cellular activity throughout life would cause or contribute to pathologies later in life (Buckner et al., 2009; Jagust and Mormino, 2012; Vlassenko and Raichle, 2015) . It has been proposed for instance that glyceralehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a key enzyme of glycolysis, would promote amyloid-b aggregation (Itakura et al., 2015) , or that excessive neuronal activity would increase the production of amyloid-b from the amyloid precursor protein (Cirrito et al., 2005) . Alternatively, it is also possible that brain disorders that are associated with metabolic distress will selectively manifest network abnormalities in high-cost components such as hubs (Bullmore and Sporns, 2012) . In other words, driven by economical load, Alzheimer's disease pathology would attack the most expensive (hub) nodes of a brain network. Here we showed that hypometabolism (at baseline and over time) and amyloid-b deposition (at baseline), but not atrophy, seem to follow this rule of affecting predominantly the most expensive (metabolically active and functionally connected) brain regions. Both hypometabolism and amyloid-b deposition at baseline were also predicted by their respective specific connectivity, suggesting that, in addition to hub vulnerability, the topography of these processes is also influenced by their specific functional connectivity to the epicentre. This is in line with the idea that hypometabolism not only reflects alterations but might also result from disconnection processes, i.e. occurs as a reflect of alterations in connected brain regions (Villain et al., 2008 (Villain et al., , 2010a Choo et al., 2010; Teipel and Grothe, 2016) . As for amyloid-b deposition, our findings suggest that the topography reflects both the preferential involvement of hubs and the fact that amyloid-b lesions contaminate functionally connected areas. Note that we did not find amyloid-b propagation to be predicted by either global or specific connectivity. This might reflect the fact that only amyloid-b-positive patients with high level of baseline amyloid-b deposition were enrolled in our study and the rate of amyloid-b accumulation in most of these patients might be close to plateau (Villemagne et al., 2011; Villain et al., 2012) . This is consistent with the fact that the longitudinal changes in amyloid-b deposition were found to be less significant than those observed for atrophy or hypometabolism (Fig.  2) .\nContrastingly, we found that atrophy topography and propagation were better predicted by specific, instead of global, connectivity. This finding supports the transneuronal propagation hypothesis according to which Alzheimer's disease pathology would start in an epicentre region (here the left hippocampus) from which it would then spread neuron-to-neuron through a prion-like mechanism (Seeley et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2012) . This transneuronal propagation process has been especially demonstrated for intraneuronal tau-rich aggregates that spread from one region to another in a stereotypical manner following neuroanatomy connections (Braak and Braak, 1991; Duyckaerts et al., 1998; Braak and Del Tredici, 2011; de Calignon et al., 2012; Ahmed et al., 2014) . Histopathological studies have shown for instance that Alzheimer's disease-related tau pathology would begin within the locus coeruleus and then spread to the transentorhinal region, which receives axonal projections from the locus coeruleus (Braak and Del Tredici, 2011; Duyckaerts, 2013) . We think that, in the context of Alzheimer's disease (which we increased the probability in our sample as only amyloid-b positive patients were included), atrophy mainly reflects tau pathology (Whitwell et al., 2008) . Thus, atrophy propagation can reflect tau propagation, which would be rather linked to synaptic connectivity via network-dependent spread than global functional connectivity reflected in hubs. Note that, in addition to specific connectivity, we found atrophy topography to be also negatively predicted by global connectivity suggesting that regions with low global connectivity are more vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease-related atrophy than hubs. This is the first study to report such a negative relationship between atrophy and hubs, which might reflect the fact that this relationship is only evidenced when taking both specific and global connectivity into account, and/or that no previous study investigated the relationships between atrophy and global functional connectivity throughout all putative functional areas. Pending replication, this finding has important implication as it indicates that tau pathology accumulation is driven by different factors compared to hypometabolism and amyloid-b deposition that showed an inverse (positive) relationship to global functional connectivity. Several brain regions, mainly within the ventral posterior cingulate, medial frontal, angular and inferior temporal cortex are included in both global and specific connectivity networks. Interestingly, these regions were also those showing the most important rates of change, i.e. the inferior temporal, angular and posterior cingulate cortex for atrophy and posterior cingulate cortex for hypometabolism. We think that, given their pivotal position at the crossroad between the specific and global connectivity networks, the involvement of these brain regions represents a critical step in the evolution of the disease. They might represent convergent points between Alzheimer's disease lesions (e.g. tau and amyloid-b), promoting their synergistic deleterious effects (Gotz et al., 2004; Mormino et al., 2009; Ittner and G\u00f6 tz, 2011; Ch\u00e9telat and Fouquet, 2013; Wirth et al., 2013; Villeneuve et al., 2015) . This amplification process might thus reflect the facts that (i) tau and amyloid-b lesions are thought to interact to promote the pathological process either via dual pathways (Small and Duff, 2008) and/or via synergistic effect (Rhein et al., 2009); and/or (ii) the propagation of lesions is heightened once they reach these crossroad regions as they are major hubs characterized by particularly dense interconnection and rich-club organization (van den Heuvel and Sporns, 2013).\nHere we studied the relative impact of what we called specific and global connectivity on different neuroimaging modalities supposed to reflect different pathological processes of the disease. This is a first step through an overall understanding of the pathology propagation processes. Further studies are needed, including in larger samples and separating amyloid-positive mild cognitive impairment from Alzheimer's disease to assess the effect of disease stages. Moreover, complementary approaches to assess specific and global connectivity could be explored, other potential determinants of lesion topography and spread could be tested (e.g. Euclidian distance, structural connectivity, hubs defined by aggregated measures, etc.), and other neuroimaging markers (such as tau-PET imaging) could be used. Further studies are thus needed so that we get a more complete understanding of the main determinants of the lesions and their propagation rules that would help to develop therapeutic strategies."}]
