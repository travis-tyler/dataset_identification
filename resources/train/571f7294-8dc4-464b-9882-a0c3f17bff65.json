[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Foraminifera from salt marshes and tidal flats have a strong relationship to the frequency and duration of tidal flooding that is directly correlated with elevation in the tidal zone (Gehrels, 1994;Horton and Edwards, 2006). Characteristic assemblages with differing tolerances to inundation period distinguish among tidal-flat, low-marsh, high-marsh, and highest-marsh environments, making foraminifera a proxy for sea level (Scott and Medioli, 1978;Jennings and Nelson, 1992;Patterson and others, 2000;Hawkes and others, 2010). A prerequisite for paleoenvironmental interpretation of foraminiferal assemblages preserved in coastal sediment is description of the distribution and ecological associations of their modern counterparts. The composition and elevational range of assemblages varies in response to factors such as climate and salinity, making it necessary to compile a modern dataset for the locality or region where sea level will be reconstructed (Hayward and others, 1999;Robinson and McBride, 2006;Wright and others, 2011). Relative sea-level (RSL) changes along coasts are the net result of simultaneous sea-level and land-level movements. During the past 3000-4000 years, tectonic land-level movements of millimeters to centimeters/year along some plate-boundary coasts have at least temporarily overwhelmed regional sea-level changes and glacio-isostatic land-level changes of less than a few millimeters/year (Nelson, 2007). The largest land-level movements are caused by cycles of uplift and subsidence from great (Magnitude 8+) earthquakes on subduction zones, such as the Alaska-Aleutian subduction zone ( Fig. 1; Carver and Plafker, 2008;Shennan and others, 2009). Near instantaneous uplift or subsidence of decimeters to a meter or more during the coseismic part of the earthquake deformation cycle is followed by the interseismic period of hundreds to thousands of years when strain accumulates slowly with gradual land-level movement that is usually in the opposite direction of the coseismic movement. The direction of land movement (subsidence or uplift) is dependent on site location with respect to coseismic slip on the subductionplate boundary and subduction-zone geometry. During the 1964 earthquake on the Alaska-Aleutian subduction zone (M 9.2), estimated coseismic land-level movement ranged from 2 m of subsidence to 8 m of uplift (Plafker, 1965(Plafker, , 1969Carver and Plafker, 2008). At suitable sites these land-level movements are recorded in coastal sediments (e.g., former tidal marshes) as RSL changes (Atwater and Hemphill-Haley, 1997;Shennan and others, 1999;Hamilton and Shennan, 2005a;Nelson and others, 2008;Hawkes and others, 2011). Quantitative RSL reconstructions estimate the amount of subsidence or uplift during past earthquakes by using a dataset of modern foraminifera (or an alternative microfossil group such as diatoms or pollen) to calculate the elevation at which assemblages preserved in buried sediment were deposited. Earthquake histories developed from radiocarbon-dated coseismic RSL changes are a primary basis for forecasting the magnitude and recurrence of future great earthquakes and their accompanying tsunamis (Nelson and others, 1996;Witter and others, 2003;Cisternas and others, 2005;Shennan and Hamilton, 2006;Shennan and others, 2008). The Alaska-Aleutian subduction zone ( Fig. 1) produced three of the 20 th century's 10 largest earthquakes, (AD 1964 5 M 9.2, AD 1957 5 M 9.1, AD 1965 5 M 8.7) and will generate great earthquakes in the future (Plafker, 1965(Plafker, , 1969Carver and Plafker, 2008;Butler, 2012). Almost FIGURE 1. Location of Sitkinak Island in the Kodiak and Trinity Islands (A, B), and Simeonof Island in the Shumagin Islands (A, E), Alaska. These islands are situated above the Alaska-Aleutian subduction zone. C, D Sitkinak Island study area in the South Lagoon where sediment samples were collected along three transects (Tr.1,Tr.2,Tr.3) to describe the distribution of modern foraminifera. F, G Simeonof Island study area where sediment samples were collected along transects in high-marsh (Tr. 1) and tidal-flat (Tr. 2) environments. nothing is known about the pre-20 th century history of great earthquakes and tsunamis in the Alaska-Aleutian subduction zone west of Kodiak Island (Carver and Plafker, 2008;Fig. 1). As a first step towards reconstructing RSL along the Alaska-Aleutian subduction zone, we describe the modern distribution of salt-marsh and tidal-flat foraminifera from Sitkinak Island in the Trinity Islands, and from Simeonof Island in the Shumagin Islands, Alaska (Fig. 1). On Sitkinak Island, foraminifera were documented along three transects that included tidal-flat, salt-marsh, and supratidal environments. Two low-diversity zones were found, a lowmarsh assemblage of Miliammina fusca (Brady) and a highmarsh assemblage of Balticammina pseudomacrescens (Br\u00f6nnimann, Lutze and Whittaker). On Simeonof Island, a transect bisecting high salt-marsh and coastal-dune environments was dominated by B. pseudomacrescens. A second transect across a tidal flat was dominated by Cibicides lobatulus (Walker and Jacob). These regional assemblages make it possible to reconstruct abrupt land-level changes caused by great earthquakes in suitable coastal sediments along the Alaska-Aleutian subduction zone. The direction of abrupt RSL change can be determined if alternating assemblages of B. pseudomacrescens and low-marsh or tidal-flat foraminifera can be identified."}, {"section_title": "STUDY AREAS SITKINAK ISLAND", "text": "Sitkinak Island (Fig. 1) covers 206 km 2 and is part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. The climate is strongly influenced by the northern Gulf of Alaska; mean annual precipitation is 1249 mm and mean annual temperature is 4.4uC (Leslie, 1989). Although the island has no yearround, permanent population, it was home to a United States Coast Guard long-range navigation (LORAN) station from 1960-1977. This facility was staffed and suffered minor damage during the 1964 earthquake (Britt, 1965). Rock and sediment on Sitkinak Island document ,50 Myr of geologic processes in the forearc of the Aleutian volcanic arc above the Alaska-Aleutian subduction zone. Bedrock consists of the Eocene Sitkalidak Formation (Moore, 1969). Sediments in this formation accumulated as coalescing submarine fans on the subduction-zone trench floor (or in a trench-slope basin) that were subsequently scraped off and incorporated into the accretionary prism (Nilsen and Moore, 1979). Overlying the Sitkalidak Formation are slope basin deposits of Oligocene, Miocene, and Pliocene age (Clendenen and others, 1992). Today the subduction-zone megathrust lies ,30 km beneath the island, and last ruptured during the 1964 M 9.2 earthquake (Pflaker, 1969). A rancher living on the northwest edge of the North Lagoon during the earthquake noted ,0.6 m of shoreline uplift immediately following the earthquake, which had apparently subsided to ,0.3 m many weeks later (Pflaker, 1969, andpersonal communication, 2011). The Plate Boundary Observatory's GPS instrument (Station AC45) situated on Sitkinak Dome (Fig. 1C) shows approximately 3 mm/yr subsidence since June 2006. Salt-marsh plants around the South Lagoon on Sitkinak Island (Fig. 1D) are typical of tidal settings in southern Alaska (Vince and Snow, 1984). Valley bottoms and lowland areas surrounding the lagoons are vegetated by a waterlogged Eriophorum callitrix (Chamisso) meadow with Athyrium filix-femina (Linnaeus), Equisetum sp., Carex spp., Calamagrostis canadensis (Beauvois), and Caltha palustris (Linnaeus). Stranded logs are common near the lagoon, probably washed in during extreme storms or tsunamis. Without trees, the transition from saturated meadow to salt marsh is difficult to identify. Some high salt-marsh communities to the north and west of the lagoon are characterized mainly by Carex spp. [much of it C. lyngbyei (Hornemann)] with Plantago maritima (Linnaeus) and Triglochin maritima (Linnaeus) at lower elevations. A more diverse community along transect 3 includes A. filixfemina, C. lyngbyei, Equisetum sp., Lysichiton americanum (Schott), C. palustris, and C. canadensis near footslopes, with minor Geranium erianthum (Candolle), Angelica lucida (Linnaeus), Urtica dioica (Linnaeus), Aster subspicatus (Nees), Sanguisorba stipulata (Rafinesque), Veratrum viride (Aiton), Tofieldia pusilla (Persoon), Platanthera dilatata (Lindley), and Rumex arcticus (Trautvetter). Below this, a high middle marsh dominated by C. lyngbyei, Carex ramenskii? (Komarov), C. palustris, C. canadensis, and Potentilla egedei (Wormskj\u00f6 ld) drops gradually into a low marsh of mostly P. maritima, T. maritima, Carex spp., and P. egedei, with Chrysanthemum arcticum (Linnaeus), Silene involucrata (Chamisso and Schlechtendal), and Puccinellia triflora? (Swallen) also present. Other low marsh areas to the west of transect 3 are typically vegetated only with P. maritima, T. maritima, and Puccinellia phryganodes (Schribner and Merril). Expansive areas of tidal flat are sparsely covered by T. maritima, P. phryganodes, and cyanobacteria."}, {"section_title": "SIMEONOF ISLAND", "text": "Simeonof Island is the southernmost of the Shumagin Islands south of the Alaskan Peninsula (Fig. 1), and has a windy maritime climate with cool, humid, and cloudy conditions. It covers an area of 105 km 2 and was incorporated into the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge in 1980. The closest precipitation and temperature measurements to the island are from Cold Bay (approximately 200 km north on the Alaskan Peninsula) with mean annual precipitation of 871 mm and mean annual temperature of 3.3uC (Leslie, 1989) and from Sand Point (,100 km northwest; Fig. 1E), where a seven-year climatedata study recorded 1199 mm of annual precipitation and a mean annual temperature of 4.7uC (Leslie, 1989). Simeonof's bedrock is largely granodiorite (Burk, 1965) that formed during an Early Tertiary episode of ridge subduction (Bradley and others, 2003). The island is positioned in the ''Shumagin seismic gap,'' a region that has spurred much debate over the nature of large earthquake ruptures along this portion of the Alaska-Aleutian subduction zone others, 1984, 1986;Savage and Lisowski, 1986;Hurst and Beavan, 1987;Boyd and others, 1988;Larson and Lisowski, 1994;Zheng and others, 1996). The plate boundary in this region may be slipping smoothly, and the principle question is whether the ruptures of large earthquakes stop at, or extend through, the Shumagin seismic gap (for perspective see Freymueller and others, 2008). Measurements made by the Plate Boundary Observatory's GPS station (AC12) at Chernabura (Fig. 1E) show subsidence of ,1.5 mm/yr since May 2008. Unlike the majority of the Shumagin Islands, Simeonof Island has extensive lowlands surrounding a central mountain (Talbot and others, 2002). The treeless vegetation is dominated by the dwarf shrub Empetrum nigrum (Linneaus) (Daniels and others, 1998). The transition between fresh and salt marsh is marked by a change in dominance to the coastal dune grass Elymus mollis (Trinius). The spatially restricted high salt-marsh community dominated by Carex spp. and Potentilla egedei is typical of southern Alaska (Vince and Snow, 1984), although these species are also found in freshwater environments on Simeonof Island. Low-marsh environments are absent. Tidal flats are sparsely covered by the seagrass Zostera maritima (Gaertner)."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "We collected samples along three transects around the South Lagoon on Sitkinak Island (Figs. 1, 3) in July 2011. Each transect spanned the elevational and environmental gradient from tidal-flat through low-and high-marsh floral communities into the supratidal zone. On Simeonof Island, two transects were collected across a high marsh and a large tidal flat in August 2011 ( Fig. 1). We were unable to position a single transect to capture both of these distinctive physiographic environments. Sampling points (stations) were positioned along the transects at regular increments in elevation change. At each station a surface sample (0-1-cm depth) was collected for foraminiferal analysis and stored in buffered ethanol with rose Bengal to allow differentiation of living and dead foraminifera at the time of collection (Walton, 1952;Figueira and others, 2012). Samples were sieved to retain the fraction between 63-500 mm, from which dead foraminifera were counted wet under a binocular microscope. Foraminifera in the Simeonof tidal-flat samples were isolated from the retained clastic sediment using density separation (sodium polytungstate; Munsterman and Kerstholt, 1996). A minimum of 100 individuals were identified from a known sediment volume or from the entire sample (30-50 ml) when ,100 were present. We counted only dead assemblages (Appendix 1); these represent naturally averaged populations that mitigate the influence of seasonality and patchiness in live assemblages and are therefore appropriate analogies for paleoenvironmental reconstruction (Culver and Horton, 2005). On Sitkinak Island, sample elevation and horizontal position were estimated using a Magellan ProMark 500 real-time kinematic Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). The GNSS base station ran for 8 h on 26 July 2011 and established elevations relative to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88) and the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83), using corrections from the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS) network via the NGS Online Positioning User Service (OPUS). We estimate that relative station elevation errors are 3.1 cm (one-sigma), which include a 2-cm error for the RTK-derived ellipsoid elevations and a 1.1-cm error for the conversion to NAVD88. Uncertainty in absolute (orthometric) height is difficult to evaluate because errors in the GEOID09 model at the study site are unknown, as they are based on a sparse network of vertical control points along this tectonically active coast. On Simeonof Island, relative sample elevations were determined using the same GNSS system on 15 August 2011. A water-level logger was installed close to transect 2 at Camp Bay (Fig. 1G) and ran from 8-18 August 2011 with a five minute measurement frequency (Fig. 2). The validity of these measurements was confirmed by comparison with verified tides over the same period from the nearest NOAA tide gauge (9459450) at Sand Point (Fig. 1E). No significant offset was noted in either the timing or magnitude of tides between Sand Point and Simeonof Island, so we used the Sand Point tide-gauge data to establish the elevation of the water-level logger (and subsequently, individual samples) with respect to local tidal datums. The relationship between floral zones and tide levels on Simeonof Island was then used to reference samples on Sitkinak Island to the assumed position of mean high water (MHW)."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "The diversity of foraminifera on Sitkinak and Simoneof islands is low, but distinctive assemblages with different elevational ranges constitute viable sea-level indicators. To establish the distribution of modern salt-marsh foraminifera, 40 surface-sediment samples were collected from the three Sitkinak transects. Two species of foraminifera comprised .98% of the recorded dead tests. Miliammina fusca dominated low-marsh environments and Balticammina pseudomacrescens dominated a narrower high-marsh zone above the lower limit of Carex spp. On Simeonof Island, from 18 samples along two transects, we recognized a high-marsh assemblage of B. pseudomacrescens and a tidal-flat assemblage dominated by Cibicides lobatulus. Sitkinak transect 1 (10 samples, elevational range of 1.48 m) crossed a marsh plant community of Carex spp. and Plantago maritima with some Triglochin maritima, and gradually dropped to a tidal flat partially covered by Puccinellia phryganodes. A sample was also collected from the center of a subtidal channel (Station 10, Fig. 3). Eight samples from the channel, tidal flat, and Plantago maritima zone (0.45-1.85 m NAVD88) were dominated by M. fusca (57-100%). Two samples from the Carex spp. marsh (1.88-1.93 m NAVD88) were dominated by B. pseudomacrescens (97% and 99%). Transect 2 (10 samples, elevational range of 1.84 m) crossed a monospecific zone of Carex lyngbyei, a narrow high marsh vegetated by Carex spp. with P. maritima and T. maritima, and also a largely unvegetated, sandy tidal flat with scattered Carex spp. (Fig. 3). The four lowest samples (0.37-1.09 m NAVD88) were dominated by M. fusca (82-94%). In one sample (Station 6, 1.35 m NAVD88), B. pseudomacrescens was the most common species (54%). Foraminifera were absent in the five highest samples, despite the presence of plants that suggest tidal inundation. Transect 3 (20 samples, elevational range of 3.89 m) had the most plant species because it included eight upland samples. Foraminifera were absent in these samples (1.98-4.33 m NAVD88). Balticammina pseudomacrescens was the primary assemblage component (55-100%) of samples 9-12 (1.88-1.91 m NAVD88), from a middle-tolow marsh characterized by P. maritima, T. maritima, Carex spp., and some Potentilla egedei. With the exception of Station 15 in a tidal channel (Fig. 3), where the percentage of plant cover is ,90% and P. phryganodes becomes the dominant vascular plant, M. fusca was the dominant species of foraminifera (72-92%). Simeonof transect 1 (eight samples, elevational range of 0.73 m) crossed a high marsh of Elymus mollis and Carex spp. with P. egedei (Fig. 4). The lowest sample (0.73 m MTL) from an unvegetated sand bank was dominated (79%) by Haplophragmoides manilaensis (Andersen). The three samples in a Carex spp. plant community between 1.06-1.32 m MTL were characterized by high abundances of B. pseudomacrescens (94-99%). The four highest samples collected at and above 1.38 m MTL were devoid of foraminifera. The other transect spanned a muddy tidal flat sparsely vegetated by Zostera maritima. Foraminifera were present in the lowest four samples, but with insufficient abundance (2-7 individuals) to reliably describe an assemblage. Cibicides lobatulus (51-71%) was the most common species in samples 5-10 that were positioned from 20.42 to 0.55m MTL. Two other species [Islandiella norcrossi (Cushman) and Trifarina fluens (Todd)] made up .10% of the assemblage in at least one of these samples. "}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Our results demonstrate that three distinctive assemblages of modern salt-marsh and tidal-flat foraminifera were found on Sitkinak and Simeonof islands. Cibicides lobatulus was the characteristic foraminifera of sparsely vegetated tidal flats on Simeonof Island, and Miliammina fusca dominated low-marsh and tidal-flat settings on Sitkinak Island. Balticammina pseudomacrescens dominated highmarsh settings on both islands. The presence of the B. pseudomacrescens assemblage at both sites, located 400 km apart, suggests that these distinctive foraminiferal assemblages could be used to reconstruct the direction (tendency) of RSL changes along the Alaska-Aleutian subduction zone. Foraminiferal assemblages reported from sandy and muddy neritic sediments (18-190-m water depth) in the Gulf of Alaska (including samples from the southern side of Kodiak Island) and Prince William Sound have high abundances of C. lobatulus (Todd and Low, 1967;Bergen and O'Neil, 1979;Carlson and Reimnitz, 1990). It is also a globally common species in estuaries, bays, and tide pools (Murray, 1991), where it is generally considered to live epifaunally (Todd and Low, 1967;Murray, 2006). The curved shape of several specimens from Simeonof Island suggests that they lived on Zostera maritima stems. In the Chukchi Sea (Cooper, 1964) and the Canadian Arctic north of Melville Island (Vilks, 1969), C. lobatulus is associated with coarse sand. The dominance of M. fusca that we observed in vegetated low-marsh environments on Sitkinak Island is similar to species distributions described in other studies from the U.S. Pacific Northwest (Jennings and Nelson, 1992;Scott and others, 1996;Hawkes and others, 2010) and the Canadian Pacific coast (Patterson and others, 1999(Patterson and others, , 2000(Patterson and others, , 2005, where it is the most abundant low-marsh species. Balticammina pseudomacrescens was recognized as an indicator species for high salt-marsh foraminiferal assemblages in Oregon, although it was not dominant, or even present, at all sites (Hawkes and others, 2010). It has also been recognized in salt marshes in New England and Atlantic Canada (de Rijk, 1995;Gehrels and van de Plassche, 1999;Wright and others, 2011), but is notably absent at sites further south (Goldstein and Watkins, 1998;Hippensteel and others, 2000;Martin and others, 2002;Kemp and others, 2009;Wright and others, 2011). This distribution may reflect the influence of climate (specifically temperature) on the distribution of B. pseudomacrescens. Low species diversity was a notable characteristic of the low and high salt-marsh foraminiferal assemblages that we described from Sitkinak Island and Simeonof Island. In contrast, high-marsh assemblages elsewhere have been characterized by a greater diversity of foraminifera both within and among sites. We did not encounter high-marsh species such as Trochammina inflata (Montagu), Jadammina macrescens (Brady) and Trochamminita irregularis (Cushman and Br\u00f6 nnimann) that are common on the U.S. Pacific Northwest and Canadian Pacific coasts (Patterson, 1990;Jennings and Nelson, 1992;Scott and others, 1996;Patterson andothers, 1999, 2005;Hawkes and others, 2010). The near monospecific nature of high salt-marsh environments on the two islands may reflect sampling of only five short transects from two sites, but a widespread, regional absence of other species is suggested because of the distance between study sites. In a short salt-marsh core from western Greenland, S. Woodroffe (personal communication, 2011) found that the only species of foraminifera present was J. macrescens. Similarly, Wright and others (2011) showed that in Newfoundland, high-marsh environments were almost exclusively characterized by B. pseudomacrescens and J. macrescens. Monospecific high-marsh assemblages have also been described in Connecticut (Edwards and others, 2004), Maine (Gehrels, 1994;Gehrels and van de Plassche, 1999), Nova Scotia (Scott and Medioli, 1978), Prince Edward Island (Scott and others, 1981), and Denmark (Gehrels and Newman, 2004). The low diversity (or monospecific) highmarsh assemblages on Sitkinak and Simeonof islands may be a result of a climate in which only B. pseudomacrescens is able to thrive. This hypothesis needs to be tested at additional sites among regions with similar climates. Use of salt-marsh foraminifera to reconstruct RSL requires that the elevation of modern assemblages is expressed relative to tidal (e.g., MHW) rather than orthometric (e.g., NAVD88) datums (van de Plassche, 1986). Tidal datums were estimated for Simeonof Island using data collected by a water-level logger, with strong agreement between this field data and verified tidal data measured at NOAA's tide-gauge station at Sand Point (Figs. 1, 2). We were unable to place samples from Sitkinak Island into a tidal framework because no tidal benchmark was accessible and our water logger failed to capture data. We could not use the tidal characteristics of the nearest available tide gauge (Alitak, Fig. 1) because the elevation of this gauge relative to NAVD88 is not reported and the tidal characteristics within the lagoon at Sitkinak Island are complex and likely differ in size and timing from those at Alitak. Our observations suggest that the tidal range within the lagoon is ,2.83 m range reported for Alitak. Given the sharp distinction between samples dominated by B. pseudomacrescens and M. fusca on Sitkinak Island, we infer this division to be close to MHW (Fig. 5). The lower limit of B. pseudomacrescens on Simeonof Island (Fig. 4) was slightly above mean-higher high water (MHHW), but we conservatively assume it corresponds to MHW because no samples were positioned between MHW and MHHW. The transition between low and high salt-marsh foraminiferal assemblages in Oregon salt marshes frequently approximates MHW (Hawkes and others, 2010). No other tidal datums could be recognized from changes among foraminiferal assemblages or plant communities. Future efforts to expand regional datasets of modern foraminifera for reconstructing RSL along the Alaska-Aleutian subduction zone will need to better define the relationship of samples to tidal characteristics. Manual leveling through repeated tidal cycles is one viable alternative to using waterlevel loggers in areas without a local tide gauge (Hamilton and Shennan, 2005b). Accurate reconstruction of RSL with full consideration of errors requires that sampling captures the upper and lower elevational limits of modern foraminiferal assemblages. The full range of the B. pseudomacrescens-dominated assemblage was captured on Sitkinak and Simeonof islands (Fig. 5). Its upper and lower limits span approximately 6 9% of the tidal range on Simeonof. This narrow range makes B. pseudomacrescens a precise sea-level indicator for use in reconstructing RSL. In contrast, the lower limit of the M. fuscadominated assemblage was not observed as it remained the characteristic species in the lowest sample on each of the Sitkinak Island transects. The lower limit of C. lobalutus was not established either, but it likely occurs at ocean depths of several hundred meters (Bergen and O'Neil, 1979). By failing to document the lower limit of the M. fusca and C. lobalutus assemblages, estimates of RSL changes will be restricted to minimums. Nevertheless, because so little is known about earthquake-induced changes in RSL along the Alaska-Aleutian subduction zone, even qualitative estimates of RSL change, based on sudden changes in assemblages will represent a considerable advance in understanding. In summary, we distinguish three assemblages of modern tidal foraminifera from the Sitkinak and Simeonof islands. Sparsely vegetated tidal flats are dominated by C. lobatulus on Simeonof Island. Low-marsh settings are characterized by abundant M. fusca on Sitkinak Island, while the high marsh (likely above MHW) at both islands is dominated by B. pseudomacrescens, whose elevational range is narrow (approximately 6 9% of Simeonof Island tidal range), making it a precise sea-level indicator. These results indicate that salt-marsh foraminifera can be used to reconstruct RSL changes during earthquake deformation cycles along the Alaska-Aleutian subduction zone, if their species distributions are reliably measured in relation to tidal elevations.

Assemblages represented as those with .50% Balticammina pseudomacrescens (filled circles), .50% Miliammina fusca (open squares), or .50% Cibicides lobatulus (gray triangles). Tidal elevations were established on Simeonof Island using a water-level logger and nearby tide-gauge data. Distributions of plants and foraminifera relative to these tidal datums were used to estimate the position of mean high water (MHW) on Sitkinak Island (see text for additional details)."}]
