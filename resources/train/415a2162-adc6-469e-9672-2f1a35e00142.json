[5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Several mechanisms may underlie the neuropathologic enlargement of VRS, including increased permeability of the arterial wall, brain atrophy and tissue fibrosis, perivascular demyelination, and obstruction of lymphatic drainage pathways and/or CSF circulation. 3, 10 VRSs have been identified as a biomarker indicative of microvascular disease and are strongly related to systemic vascular disease; a possible association of VRS with vascular risk factors has been proposed. 5, [11] [12] [13] Many vascular risk factors are also risk factors for AD 14, 15 so vascular and degenerative mechanisms are considered to have parallel effects. If the severity of VRSs could be an independent feature indicating vascular impairment with involvement of cerebral arteries, then it is arguable that increased VRS severity should also be associated with AD. Indeed, both pathologic enlargement of VRS in AD [16] [17] [18] and relations of VRS MR imaging features with cognitive decline have been reported. 19 Even so, to date no study has directly compared the radiologic characteristics of VRSs in patients with AD and older adults who are CN. Therefore, to our knowledge, direct association between AD and changes of MR imaging features of VRSs has not been examined. The objectives of the present study were the following: 1) to assess the radiologic characteristics of the VRS; 2) to compare the frequency and severity of the VRSs in individuals with AD and MCI and in older adults who are CN; and 3) to investigate the relations of VRSs to brain atrophy, white matter changes, and cognitive decline."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "Data used for this study were obtained from the ADNI. 20 The ADNI (Table 1 ).

The VRSs were scored independently in 8 brain regions, including structures in the white matter (subregions of the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and the centrum semiovale), basal ganglia region (including the caudate, lentiform nuclei, thalamus, internal capsule, substantia innominata, and insular area), brain stem, and hippocampal area (including the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdalae). Scaling grades varied by structures, given the anatomy and VRS attenuation within these structures. Specifically, a 6-grade (0 -5) scale was used for each of the white matter subregions (where 0 \u03ed none; 1 \u03ed \u05455 per side; 2 \u03ed 5-10 on the severe side; 3 \u03ed \u03fe10 on the severe side; 4 \u03ed \u03fe10, with any VRS \u05463 mm on 1 side; 5 \u03ed \u03fe10, with any VRS \u05463 mm on both sides). Similarly, 5 grades (0 -4) were assigned for the basal ganglia region (where 0 \u03ed \u054510 on the severe side; 1 \u03ed 10 -20 on the severe side; 2 \u03ed \u03fe20 on the severe side; 3 \u03ed \u03fe20, with any VRS \u05463 mm on 1 side; 4 \u03ed \u03fe20, with any VRS \u05463 mm on both sides) and for the hippocampal area (where 0 \u03ed none; 1 \u03ed \u05455 on the severe side; 2 \u03ed \u03fe5 on the severe side; 3 \u03ed \u03fe5 and at least 1 VRS \u05463 mm on 1 side; 4 \u03ed \u03fe5, with any VRS \u05463 mm on both sides). Four grades (0 -3) were assigned for the brain stem (0 \u03ed none; 1 \u03ed \u05455; 2 \u03ed \u03fe5; 3 \u03ed \u03fe5, with any VRS \u05463 mm). Examples of the VRS rating are given in Fig 1. Summarizing the subscales of various structures resulted in a total score ranging between a minimum of zero and a possible maximum of 36. Severe VRSs within a structure were defined as subscale \u05462.\nThe VRSs and lacunar infarctions were separated primarily on the basis of their size. As documented in the literature, 16 lacunar infarctions are usually \u03fe5 mm in diameter, larger than VRSs, which are usually \u03fd2 mm. Additional discrimination was based on their shape. VRSs are typically symmetrically presented across both hemispheres, while lacunar infarctions are usually asymmetric."}, {"section_title": "Rating of White Matter Abnormality and Atrophy", "text": "To determine the relationship of the VRSs with whole-brain atrophy and white matter changes, we constructed a brain atrophy and lesion index 22 for each subject.

The deep white matter lesions were scored with 6 grades (0 \u03ed absent; 1 \u03ed punctuate foci; 2 \u03ed beginning of confluence foci; 3 \u03ed large confluent areas; 4 \u03ed large confluent white matter areas involving all cerebral lobes; 5 \u03ed complete confluent white matter disease). This resulted in a 9-level score for leukoaraiosis.

All images were independently assessed by 2 experienced neuroradiologists, blinded to the participants' demographic and cognitive statuses. One rater has 8 and the other has 15 years of experience. Differences among diagnostic groups were compared by using ANOVA. Interrelations between the VRS score and confounders, including atrophy and leukoaraiosis, clinical diagnosis, sex, age, the MMSE score, and the vascular risk factors, were examined by using regression models. The performance of VRS total score in distinguishing individuals with AD from those who were CN was evaluated by using the AUC and ROC. Statistics were performed by using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, Version 15.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois) and codes developed by using Matlab, "}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The inter-rater agreement analysis showed high reliability (ICC \u03ed 0.91; 95% CI, 0.81-0.96 for VRS score; ICC \u03ed 0.89, 95% CI, 0.81-0.93 for white matter lesions; and ICC \u03ed 0.86, 95% CI, 0.80 -0.91 for atrophy). There was no difference in age between diagnostic groups; but the MCI group consisted of more men compared with the AD or CN groups (63.4% versus \u03fd40%). More patients with AD and MCI had a history of stroke and hypertension, compared with healthy controls (Table 1) .\nVRSs were observed in the brains of all subjects regardless of diagnostic group, even though not everyone showed VRSs in all structures. Within each group, the VRS score differed among people with different vascular profiles. For example, individuals with AD with a history of hypertension had a mean VRS number of 17.56 \u03ee 2.61, which was significantly higher than that of patients with AD who did not have hypertension (15.19 \u03ee 4.78, P \u03ed .002). The VRSs were most common in the bilateral basal ganglia regions. The greatest percentage of severe VRSs was found in the parietal lobe (82.3%), followed by the central semiovale (69.0%) and frontal lobe (65.2%). Diffused VRSs in the whole brain were observed in 7.0% of subjects, with a higher frequency in patients with AD (10.8%) and MCI (7.1%) than in those who were CN (4%). Significant group differences were found in VRS subscales (F \u03ed 3.52-13.76, P \u03fd .05) and total score (F \u03ed 16.50, P \u03fd .001; AD\u03feMCI\u03feCN; On-line table).\nCorrelations among VRS subscales appeared to be diagnosis-dependent. The VRS subscales in the white matter structures were correlated in each diagnostic group. However, correlations between the VRSs in the white matter and basal ganglia or brain stem were observed only in the CN subjects, while the VRSs in the basal ganglia or brain stem were correlated both CN and MCI subjects. In no group were the hippocampal VRSs correlated with VRS subjects in other structures, ie, white matter, basal ganglia, or brain stem. (Table 2 ). The VRS total score increased with age in CN and MCI (P \u03fd .001, Fig 2A) , with group differences in initial VRS levels and rates of change. In contrast, individuals with AD showed a high initial value, which did not increase with age. Most subscales were closely related to age (except the parietal lobe and hippocampal subscales) (r \u03ed 0.16 -0.27, P \u03ed .001-.044).\nA negative correlation between the VRS total score and the MMSE score was observed for all subjects (r \u03ed \u03ea0.21, P \u03ed .009; Fig 2B) . The basal ganglia (r \u03ed \u03ea0.37, P \u03fd .001), frontal lobe (r \u03ed \u03ea0.23, P \u03ed .004), brain stem (r \u03ed \u03ea0.17, P \u03ed .034), and hippocampal area (r \u03ed \u03ea0.17, P \u03ed .038) subscales were each related to the MMSE scores.\nThe VRS total score increased with atrophy severity in CN (r \u03ed 0.31, P \u03fd .001) but not in MCI or AD subjects. The VRS total score (Fig 3) and most subscales (except the hippocampal subscale) were correlated with leukoaraiosis (r \u03ed 0.55, P \u03fd .001 for VRS total score; r \u03ed 0.29 -0.49, P \u03fd .001 for the subscales). Leukoaraiosis accounted for 29.6% of the VRS variability, while diagnosis accounted for 10.6% and MMSE for 1.1%. Age, sex, and atrophy were insignificant in a multivariate model. Of note, the effect of leukoaraiosis on VRSs was more evident in CN (31.8%) and MCI (33.8%) than in AD (18.1%) subjects. The VRS total score distinguished 78.9% of individuals with AD from those who were CN (Fig 4) subjects.\nOf the 71 patients with MCI, 18 (25.4%) converted to AD within 12 months. Most of the converters had a VRS total score that was above the MCI group mean VRS value (16.38 \u03ee 4.79 for the converters versus 14.62 \u03ee 3.44 for nonconverters). A higher correlation coefficient for the VRSs and leukoaraiosis was observed for the converters (r \u03ed 0.71) than for the nonconverters (r \u03ed 0.54, P \u03fd .01 in both cases)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This is the first attempt to understand the whole-brain VRSs in relation to AD and MCI by using MR imaging. Results showed a higher VRS frequency in AD. The distribution and severity of VRSs were correlated with age, cognitive decline, white matter changes, and brain atrophy. This finding strongly suggests that AD is associated with significant small-vessel impairments, in accordance with white matter lesions and atrophy.\nThe observation that not only were the VRSs more frequently present in AD but that the severity of VRSs also differed with vascular deficits suggests that VRSs may be an independent feature indicating systemic vascular disease with involvement of cerebral arteries. This is in support of the current literature suggesting that VRSs are indicative of microvascular brain disease and are strongly related to systemic vascular disease. [11] [12] [13] An AD-associated increase of VRS attenuation in the white matter has been suggested by histologic studies. 23, 24 A higher attenuation of VRSs in the basal ganglia in AD has also been seen in other MR imaging studies and has been proposed to differentiate AD from vascular dementia. 11 Our data are consistent with these findings. In addition, our data show that the VRS attenuation in the whole brain (ie, not just white matter) was higher in AD and MCI than in CN subjects. The mechanisms underlying such increase are not fully understood but likely include the impact of vascular risk factors on AD neuropathogenesis. [25] [26] [27] [28] Our results show that VRS and leukoaraiosis changes are related, though they may represent different aspects of brain changes, for which the disease may impact on 1 aspect more than on the other. It seemed that changes in VRS features were not identical to those of white matter lesions and were more likely to be affected by AD pathology, as shown by the group difference. Whether a causal relationship exists between VRSs and leukoaraiosis is unclear. Even so, leukoaraiosis was more prominent for VRSs than other factors such as global atrophy, consistent in the present and other studies. 19, 29, 30 Indeed, the VRSs and leukoaraiosis have similar pathogenesis; both are triggered by the slow occlusion of interstitial fluid due to the deposition of \u2424-amyloid in the cortical and leptomeningeal arteries in AD. 24, 31 It is known that the prevalence of VRSs increases with advanced age, 3, 4 and our data verify this. Our data further suggest that the relationship with age (and with atrophy) varied with diagnosis (ie, a stronger relationship was observed in CN individuals and it disappeared in patients with AD). This result is not surprising: Complex factors may be associated with AD process, in addition to age-associated vascular burdens, which may affect VRS formation and other neuropathologic changes. 24, 31 Note the differences of VRSs in the basal ganglia region among the AD, MCI, and CN groups. These may potentially serve as a novel criterion for diagnosis. 11 Nevertheless, currently the basal ganglia substructures (eg, the caudate nucleus, lentiform nucleus, substantia innominata, and so forth) have not been separated in the VRS rating, and it is not understood whether any substructures in this region may be more important than the others. Such separation appears to be beneficial because variations in the VRS frequency have been found among basal ganglia substructures, related to the characteristics of their functional anatomy. 3, 32 Future research should take this into consideration.\nOur data must be interpreted with caution. This study applied T1WI to score VRSs. Previous studies have shown that 3D T1WI might be superior to T2WI for visualizing VRSs; however, it might not be optimal. 11 Even so, T1WI is one of the most accessible sequences that have been repeatedly used to show advantages for detecting VRSs. The 3D high-resolution T1WI is particularly appealing, considering that it can display the VRSs better than other imaging involving intersection gaps. 3 In multiple brain regions, the VRSs were detectable in 100% of the subjects with AD or MCI and in healthy controls. These findings are largely attributed to the improved signal intensity-to-noise ratio and imaging contrast at higher MR imaging field strengths 3, 4 as well as to the high-resolution T1WI that can allow even small-sized VRSs to be visualized. 3, 11 Furthermore, it is difficult to completely rule out small lacunar infarctions from the VRSs. This was the case in the basal ganglia area and brain stem, where numerous signalintensity variations are present. Although small lacunes and VRSs have different pathologic features, they sometimes can have similar appearances on MR imaging. On the other hand, in practice, the VRSs appear to have an upper size limit and seldom reach a diameter of 5 mm. The hypointensities on T1WI are more likely to be lacunes rather than VRSs if they are \u05465 mm. 3, 4 VRSs also have sharp edges, while lacunes may show irregular edges because of gliosis around the lesion. Furthermore, VRSs are usually symmetric, while lacunes are asymmetrically distributed across the hemispheres. In this study, lacunar infarctions (\u03fe5 mm) were found in \u03fd5% of the subjects, with no significant difference among the 3 groups.\nAs a visual scale, the rating is inherently imprecise, compared with volumetric measurements. In particular, white matter changes could be better measured in volume than by using a rating scale. Even so, visual rating scales are much faster and do not require intensive expert input and, thus, are applicable in clinical and research settings, especially when time is a concern. The current rating system was adapted from well-validated scaling systems and included detailed locationspecific subscales for improved usability."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This article evaluated the radiologic features of the VRS in AD, MCI, and CN subjects. VRSs were presented in multiple brain structures with higher densities in patients with AD and MCI compared with those with normal aging. The distribution and severity of VRSs were correlated with age, cognitive decline, and white matter changes. This study provides novel evidence suggesting that AD is associated with small-vessel impairments, in accordance with other structural changes in the brain. Because the present study primarily has a cross-sectional design, it is not completely clear whether dilation of VRSs precedes the development of clinically overt AD. In the future, larger scale longitudinal MR imaging studies with outcomes regarding dementia and/or cognitive decline will help "}]
