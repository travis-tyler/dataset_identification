Given that many of these studies focusing on brain structural networks have utilized seed-based or network-based approaches with nodes defined a priori, we aim to perform connectome-wide association (CWAS) studies in a data-driven manner, to avoid potentially biased assumptions in understanding of how the underlying neuroanatomy is altered due to AD.\nAn intuitive analytical approach in data-driven CWAS studies is mass univariate testing on an individual basis. However, this approach may not offer sufficient statistical power when every connection comprising the network is tested independently (Zalesky et al., 2010) . When research of interests is associated with global network properties, two main strategies in CWAS studies have been proposed to quantify structural networks as a continuum:\ndimensionality reduction and graph analysis. In the first, key components can be selected from an individual network matrix by different approaches, including principle component analysis (Zhan et al., 2015) and matrix factorization (Ball et al., 2017) , so that the weights of components can be discriminated across groups. In the second, high-level graph metrics, such as small-world, nodal degree, and clustering coefficient, can be derived (Alexander-Bloch et al., 2013) . Previous tractography studies using graph theory have reported abnormalities among MCI and AD populations in several brain areas, including the frontal (He et al., 2009; Lo et al., 2010) , temporal (Fischer et al., 2015) , and posterior-medial parietal cortices (Hagmann et al., 2008) . While both strategies have reported abnormalities in structural networks in AD (Lo et al., 2010) , they cannot adequately reflect the underlying neuroanatomy (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009 ). In particular, dimensionality reduction approaches are not fully exploratory because substantial information is lost by data reduction, and graph metrics are not specific to any one graph (e.g. different graphs can have identical network centrality). In contrast, exploratory multivariate analysis can complement graph theory for more detailed characterization of connectome variations without sacrificing connectome dimension, thus\nshowing more promising for discovering the substrate of the specific structural connectivity patterns associated with AD pathology.\nIn this study, we sought to examine the unique pattern alterations in WM structural connectivity networks during the progression of AD. Multivariate distance matrix regression (MDMR) proposed by (Shehzad et al., 2014) allows exploring connectivity-phenotype relationships without any a priori information or parameter selection. This data-driven statistical approach has been recently employed to examine the overall pattern of functional or grey matter structural connectivity associated with various clinical phenotypes, such as anhedonia (Sharma et al., 2017) , psychosis-spectrum symptoms (Satterthwaite et al., 2015) , and AD (Rasero et al., 2017b) . Inspired by this statistical framework, we applied MDMR to compare WM structural connectivity patterns among cognitively normal (CN) subjects, stable MCI (sMCI), MCI converting to AD (cMCI) patients, and AD patients. The connectome reorganization in AD progression (especially in early phase) identified by MDMR may allow for effective risk prediction of AD, as well as aid clinicians to develop a precise intervention for disconnected neural circuits.\n\nMR scanning of all subjects in this study followed the ADNI acquisition protocol (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/documents/mri-protocols). Diffusion weighted images from axial DTI scans and T1 weighted (T1W) images from sagittal inversion recovery-prepared spoiled gradient-echo scans were collected. DTI images were acquired with the following parameters: 59 slices with thickness of 2.7 mm with no gap between slices, repetition time/echo time = 9 s/60 ms, 256 \u00d7 256 matrix with a field of view of 35 cm, and flip angle = 90. Forty-one diffusion weighted images (b = 1000 s/mm 2 ) with noncollinear directions and one volume without diffusion weighting (b = 0 s/mm 2 ) were obtained.\nPre-processing of diffusion weighted images included image denoising (Veraart et al., 2016) , head-motion and eddy-current correction (Andersson and Sotiropoulos, 2016), and field inhomogeneity correction (Tustison et al., 2010) . All pre-processing steps were performed within MRtrix3 (www.mrtrix.org), which included scripts that interfaced with external packages such as the FSL (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk) (Jenkinson et al., 2012) . After preprocessing, 4D diffusion weighted images were applied to estimate the diffusion tensor model for each voxel by a probabilistic fiber tracking algorithm (Jones, 2008) . Specifically, 10,000 seeds were randomly distributed with a brain mask with fractional anisotropy (FA) values > 0.1, and streamlines that were tracked with a step size of 0.1 \u00d7 voxel size along the orientation of the principle eigenvector of the fitted tensor from each seed were terminated by the default configuration in MRtrix3 (curvature threshold = 0.02, 2000 steps maximum). It has been well recognized that deterministic tractography (Mori and van Zijl, 2002) and probabilistic tractography (Jones, 2008) are two prevalent and robust approaches for DTI fibre tracking in the scientific community. The probabilistic approach was used here because it shows higher anatomical reproducibility than the deterministic approach in terms of connectivity calculation (Bonilha et al., 2015) .\nFollowing the tractography steps, we co-registered the FA images derived from the 4D diffusion weighted images to their corresponding T1W images by affine transformation.\nBased on the next non-linear registration from native T1W images to the ICBM152 template, we obtained an inverse warping transformation from the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002) to the native DTI space. Therefore 90 brain regions not including the cerebellum were defined as WM structural network nodes, following the labels of the AAL atlas.\nThe construction of edges within a structural network, namely the brain WM connectivity, depends on the tractography performed before (Hagmann et al., 2008) . A 5% density threshold was applied to retain the strong edge (95 th percentile) weights for the connectivity matrix of each subject. We further defined the edge weight by the number of connections per unit surface between the end-nodes using a correction term of edge length, as first introduced by (Hagmann et al., 2008) . Here, the strength of structural connectivity is better represented as the probability of a given brain region to be connected with another, rather than the strength of the underlying physiological WM fibers in neuronal pathways. In this way, a 90 \u00d7 90 symmetric connectivity matrix was obtained for each subject.\nWe applied MDMR to test the variation of distance in connectivity patterns between groups.\nFirst, a distance matrix in the subject space was calculated for each region. Within each distance matrix, the distance between connectivity patterns for every possible subject pair among all groups related to region i was calculated by\nwhere is the Pearson correlation coefficient between connectivity vectors of subject u and v. Here the connectivity vector of one subject refers to the connection of the given brain region to the rest 89 regions. Next, we performed MDMR to yield a pseudo-F estimator for the cross-group analysis, by measuring the significance of between-group variation as compared to within-group variations (Shehzad et al., 2014) . Specifically, the total sum of squares for region i was calculated by\n(2) with = 1 + 2 being the total number of subjects in the case of two groups. Likewise, the within-group sum of squares was represented by\n(3)\nwhere 1 and 2 denote the number of the first and second group respectively, equals 1 if subjects u and v belong to the first group and zero otherwise, and similarly equals 1 if subjects u and v belong to the second group and zero otherwise. Given the between-group variation denoted by = \u2212 , we could calculate the pseudo-F statistic by\nBy randomly shuffling the subject indices, a p value was calculated by counting the pseudo-F statistics from permutated values greater than those derived from the original data. Age, sex and APOE-4 level were incorporated in this model as covariates. Finally, the same procedure was repeated for = 1, 2,\u2022\u2022\u2022, 90 brain regions defined in the AAL atlas. The false discovery rate correction was applied to control for type I errors due to 90 comparisons. The workflow of MDMR analysis is shown in Fig 1. We performed MDMR for both the two-group (CN vs.\nsMCI, CN vs. cMCI and CN vs. AD) and three-group (CN, cMCI and AD) comparisons.\nabove in MDMR analysis. A post-hoc permutation test was further performed to evaluate the difference between each two-group pairs. A p-value of 0.05 was set as the threshold to determine significance.\nanalysis achieved significantly better performance than the full structural connectivity in the whole brain (p = 0.045 for sensitivity and p = 0.042 for AUC)\ncontrast to these 13 regions showing significant network pattern difference between cMCI and CN groups, only one region with significant difference was observed between sMCI and CN groups, indicating potential to distinguish different disease trajectories in early stage.\nAdditionally, the disconnection pattern was more extensive between CN and AD subjects, highlighting the remarkable disruption of structural networks in the clinical stage of AD. The identified 33 regions, widely distributed in frontal, temporal, occipital, and limbic areas, with significant connectivity differences between CN and AD subjects, are largely consistent with those reported in a number of previous studies (Daianu et al., 2013; Lo et al., 2010; Wee et al., 2011) . We speculate that these disconnection patterns may explain the worsening of several cognitive functions, including episodic memory (Tromp et al., 2015) , verbal fluency ( Table 1 .\nThe follow-up analysis subsequent to MDMR explicitly described which specific patterns of structural connectivity were responsible for the significant results. Notably, we found that the intrinsic connectivity patterns among the nine seed regions with structural connectivity alterations vary differently as AD pathology progresses. For the bilateral supplementary motor area and left insula, the major pattern changes caused by AD were reflected as a progressive connectivity decline along with some specific axes in the radar chart, while the connectivity strength along with other axes generally remained integral. In particular, the connectivity between the bilateral supplementary motor area in cMCI and AD subjects exhibited reduced strength, consistent with the overall connectivity decline. The overlapping connectivity abnormalities between amplitude and pattern analysis is mainly associated with the well-known impairment of movement blindness (Buchman and Bennett, 2011) . Moreover, this finding may reflect the impaired underlying commissural fibers in AD progression, as supported by numerous DTI studies focusing on the disrupted integrity of the corpus callosum in MCI and AD patients (Preti et al., 2012; Preti et al., 2011; van Bruggen et al., 2012) . The\nremarkable connectivity reduction between the insula and the orbital part of inferior frontal gyrus in the left hemisphere is congruent with previous studies reporting that the insular cortex undergoes substantial pathological changes in AD (Bonthius et al., 2005; Foundas et al., 1997; Rombouts et al., 2000) . Since the insula plays a key role in multiple regulatory mechanisms, its disconnection could be associated with autonomic dysfunction, which could trigger the leading causes of death in AD patients, including cardiac failure and bronchopneumonia (Bonthius et al., 2005) . Furthermore, the frontoinsular cortex, as one of the integral hubs in the salience network, is involved in attentional processing and cognitive control (Marusak et al., 2015) . Thus, the observed disconnection between the left insula and the inferior frontal gyrus provides more evidence to the theory that the structural impairment of the salience network emerges in AD progression (He et al., 2014) .\nWe also found similarly diminished connectivity between the left hippocampal formation and temporal pole. The connected brain regions with the greatest effect size contributing to pattern alterations along with AD progression were basically areas strongly connected to the hippocampus anatomically, including limbic (amygdala, parahippocampus, fusiform) and paralimbic structures (temporal pole). Regions distributed in the limbic-temporal module were also reported to show altered structural connectivity in both late MCI and AD patients (Rasero et al., 2017a) . Considerable reductions in metabolic glucose (Nestor et al., 2003) and functional connectivity (Wang et al., 2007) in limbic-temporal regions also supports the reduced structural connectivity found between the left hippocampus and the temporal pole.\nWhile the mechanism underlying the occurrence of both decreased connectivity and the paradoxical slight increase within the limbic network, e.g. in the hippocampal-thalamic connectivity, remains an open question, the disruption of the Papez circuit (Aggleton et al., 2016) , which is interconnected with multiple limbic regions during AD progression may explain the significant pattern changes. Therefore, we speculate that this structural reorganization of the limbic network may account for the memory deficits observed among cMCI and AD patients. In addition, the overall reduced connectivity related to the\norbitofrontal cortex in cMCI and AD patients indicates an important role for this region in AD progression. This observation is largely congruent with prior studies reporting that orbitofrontal cortex can be damaged conspicuously by neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology in prodromal AD (Tekin et al., 2001; Van Hoesen et al., 2000) . Regarding the left thalamus, the right insula, and the left putamen, the occurrence of both decreased and paradoxically increased connectivity within each nodal network across diagnostic categories highlights the irregular connectivity patterns developing with AD progression. In contrast, the aberrantly increased connectivity between the bilateral thalamus pair, the left putamen and the supplementary motor area pair and the right insula and the superior parietal cortex pair in patients is difficult to interpret, and caution is needed to avoid ambiguity regarding the interpretability of these structural connections. Since the magnitude of structural connectivity strength can be influenced by several physiological and methodological factors (Jbabdi and Johansen-Berg, 2011; Jones et al., 2013) , further investigation and validation are required to verify whether the structural connectivity reflects the underlying white matter pathway.\nThe individual classification in cMCI groups based on the connectivity features returned from the MDMR exhibited significantly better discriminative performance than the full wholebrain connectivity (p = 0.045 for sensitivity and p = 0.042 for AUC), suggesting the power of connectivity features identified by MDMR to characterize the prodromal AD category. These structural connectivity features and the corresponding topological alterations found in our study may yield insights into neural circuit-damaging processes before onset of evident symptoms. Although the pathological mechanism of AD remains unclear, emerging evidence from CWAS studies shift the etiological focus of AD from a single-target to an integrated outlook, which highlights the disruption of neural circuits (De Strooper and Karran, 2016) and network connectivity (Palop and Mucke, 2010) . Recent studies suggest that the progressive aggregation of amyloid-\u03b2 peptides and tau levels may be induced by local circuit dysfunction in brain networks, further contributing to the subsequent abnormal activity of downstream\ntargets (Busche et al., 2015) . As the amyloid plaques and NFT propagate with the aberrant structural connectivity, brain network reorganization could explain the cognitive decline.\nAnother important finding of our study is the fair classification performance (AUC = 0.862) achieved on prodromal patients using supervised learning, which indicates the promising predictive ability of AD conversion for the individual at risk. Although the sensitivity is not remarkably high, the identified abnormal connectivity patterns during disease progression will facilitate potential interventions to alter disease trajectory or restore memory and cognition in early AD patients.\nThe multi-variate analytical approach performed in this study seems an idea data-driven strategy to localize the pattern changes of an individual brain region in a brain network associated with disease progression. The mass-univariate statistical models utilized in brain network studies have suffered from less reproducibility of significantly disrupted connectivity, increasing the risk of exaggerated scientific results (Poldrack et al., 2017) . Furthermore, the mass-univariate statistical approaches tend to ignore concurrent contributions from all entries within a connectivity matrix (Cole et al., 2010) . Therefore, the multi-variate nature of MDMR allows to overcome the drawbacks above in CWAS studies. To the best of our knowledge, only one study has investigated the AD progression in diffusion-tensor brain network consisting of 20 modules by MDMR (Rasero et al., 2017a) . In contrast, our study explicitly illustrated the anatomical brain structures with altered connectivity in a finer manner, and evaluated the predictive performance of the connectivity returned from MDMR.\nSeveral limitations of this study should be noted. First, the optimal tractography method to sensitively detect AD effects on structural networks remains a controversial issue. The two main tractography approaches (e.g. deterministic and probabilistic) have their own respective merits; the deterministic approach is advantageous for tracking long fiber tracts, while the probabilistic approach exhibits more reliable performance (Khalsa et al., 2014) . A recent study comparing nine different tractography algorithms to detect network abnormalities\ncaused by AD also indicated no universally optimal methods (Zhan et al., 2015) . In this study, the probabilistic approach was selected to construct the structural networks for two reasons: 1) the probabilistic approach has been reported as more effective against fiber-crossing issues (King et al., 2009) ; and 2) in the deterministic approach, the structural network derived is too sparse for MDMR analysis. Second, as discussed above, the biological interpretability of structural connectivity is challenging. Novel techniques on diffusion MR data, such as pixelbased analysis, offering greater anatomical specificity, can possibly explain whether the degeneration of WM tracts in AD patients is mainly due to axonal loss or demyelination (Mito et al., 2018) . Thirdly, while the motivation of this study was to distinguish structural connectivity abnormalities in cMCI and AD patients, future work is undoubtedly necessary to probe the association between network changes and specific clinical manifestations. Finally, the cross-sectional dataset with a small sample size employed in our study may bias the MDMR results. Longitudinal investigations on bigger cohorts will be helpful to validate our connectivity results.\nThis study stresses the value of implementing MDMR to investigate the topological properties of structural networks on an individual basis. While sMCI patients do not exhibit global connectivity alterations, an extensive reorganization of structural networks among cMCI and AD patients occurs in a number of cortico-subcortical regions. The aberrant pattern of structural connectivity is consistent with circuit dysfunction and functional connectivity damage reported in previous studies and supports current theories on brain network disruptions caused by AD. The impaired key structural connections that we identified demonstrate the promising distinguishing capability of MDMR to predict prodromal AD patients.\nHighlights \uf0b7 A data-driven multivariate analysis named MDMR was performed to discover the substrate of the specific structural connectivity patterns associated with AD pathology.\n\uf0b7 Several brain regions demonstrated extremely significant structural pattern changes along with the progression of AD.\n\uf0b7 The classifier based on the key structural connectivity returned by MDMR exhibits promising distinguishing capability to predict individual with mild cognitive impairment converting to AD .
