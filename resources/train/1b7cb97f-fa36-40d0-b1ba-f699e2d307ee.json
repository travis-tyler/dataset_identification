[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "ABSTRACT We used two types of laboratory apparatus to test whether rotation-resistant and wild-type Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) responded differently to corn phenology. Beetles from Nebraska where injury to rotated corn has not been reported were de\u00dened as wild type, and beetles from Illinois where injury to rotated corn is common represented \"rotation-resistant\" populations. A two-chamber emigration arena assayed propensity of both populations to leave corn during and after anthesis. A side-arm olfactometer tested whether the relative attraction of beetles to soybean versus corn was in\u00dfuenced by corn phenology. Beetle origin did not in\u00dfuence departure from corn of varying phenology; both emigrated signi\u00decantly less from young (shedding pollen) than old (no pollen) corn. Signi\u00decantly more beetles entered olfactometer chambers with soybean than empty control chambers, but there was no difference in response between the two populations. Numbers of beetles entering chambers with soybean varied with the addition of young versus old corn. Replacing young with old corn approximately doubled the percentage of beetles not selecting corn. As corn aged, adult visitation of soybean increased signi\u00decantly. We suggest this mechanism is suf\u00decient to explain injury to rotated corn, when linked to a corn crop planted early and synchronously within a landscape limited to corn and soybean. This explanation based on preexisting behavioral plasticity should be given due consideration along with conceptual models of D. v. virgifera rotation resistance that imply genetic change."}, {"section_title": "IN MUCH OF THE NORTH CENTRAL region of the United", "text": "States, annual rotation of corn, Zea mays L., and soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr., has been the principal strategy for managing corn rootworms (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) (Levine and Oloumi-Sadeghi 1991) . However, by the 1990s crop rotation had failed to protect against western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, larval injury to corn\u00deelds planted the previous year to soybean. This failure of crop rotation occurred in parts of the midwestern United States, primarily east central Illinois and northwestern Indiana (Levine et al. 2002) . Diabrotica v. virgifera is univoltine; oviposition peaks in August (Hein and Tollefson 1985) . The eggs undergo an obligatory diapause during the winter, hatch in late May through early June, and larvae feed on the roots of corn during June and July. Damage to annually rotated corn (\u00derst-year corn) occurs when adult female D. v. virgifera leave corn\u00deelds and oviposit in soybean \u00deelds (Spencer et al. 1999 , Levine et al. 2002 , O\u00d5Neal et al. 2002a . In areas where growers practice a strict corn\u00d0soybean rotation, larvae that emerge from these eggs the following year encounter corn whose roots they damage (O\u00d5Neal et al. 2001) .\nBefore the 1990s, oviposition by D. v. virgifera was considered to occur primarily in corn\u00deelds (Levine and Oloumi-Sadeghi 1991) ; thus, oviposition in soybean \u00deelds was attributed to the evolution of a beetle population distinct from the wild type. D. v. virgifera capable of injuring \u00derst-year corn rotated with soybean have been described as \"behavioral resistance\" (Onstad et al. 2001) , \"corn\u00d0soybean adapted\" (Levine et al. 2002) , \"behavioral variant\" (Sammons et al. 1997) , or \"strain\" (O\u00d5Neal et al. 1999 ). All of these terms imply a genetic shift, like that associated with insecticide resistance. We will use the term \"rotation resistance\" to describe these populations having a history of damage to \u00derst-year corn. However, we suggest it is unclear whether genetic change is required for such behavior.\nBased on olfactometer results, Sammons et al. (1997) suggested that injury to rotated corn was due to a behavioral biotype of D. v. virgifera that preferred soybean \u00deelds as oviposition sites. However, subsequent studies (Spencer et al. 1999) failed to con\u00derm that adult D. v. virgifera from regions where injury to rotated corn is common select soybean over corn. The geographic pattern of the spreading injury to rotated corn was consistent with that expected for such a new D. v. virgifera biotype originating and dispersing from east central Illinois (Onstad et al. 1999) . In addition, a simulation model (Onstad et al. 2001 ) based on modi\u00decation of a single gene locus was judged suf\u00de-cient to explain rotation resistance; however, the behaviors altered by such a genetic change have not been speci\u00deed, except that their expression requires a high degree of a corn\u00d0soybean rotation to be practiced within a landscape. Spencer et al. (1999) investigated whether Illinois D. v. virgifera were attracted to soybean over corn in a \u00dfight chamber. Overall, a greater percentage of adult females were collected on corn than soybean, even though corn tassels and silks, both sources of volatile D. v. virgifera attractants (Metcalf 1986 , Hammack 1997 , were removed before testing. Spencer et al. (1999) concluded that rotation-resistant D. v. virgifera was not strongly attracted to soybean plants and that a preference for soybean was not necessary to explain movement into soybean. Rather, they suggested that reduced \u00dedelity to corn may be suf\u00decient to explain D. v. virgifera movement and oviposition in soybean \u00deelds (Spencer et al. 1999) .\nO\u00d5Neal et al. (2002a) observed a signi\u00decant increase in feeding on soybean leaves when D. v. virgifera adults were presented with late vegetative versus early vegetative corn. The in\u00dfuence of corn phenology on adult feeding preference led O\u00d5Neal et al. (2002a) to support Spencer et al.\u00d5s (1999) proposal that reduced \u00dedelity to corn was suf\u00decient to explain rotation resistance. O\u00d5Neal et al. (2002a) postulated that, as corn matures and becomes a less attractive and acceptable food, D. v. virgifera dispersal increases. In areas dominated by corn\u00d0soybean rotation, corn is typically planted early and with a high degree of synchrony. In this situation, emigrating beetles would predominately encounter \u00deelds of equally unattractive corn or, alternatively, a soybean \u00deeld.\nOviposition in the absence of a larval host plant has been recorded for D. v. virgifera (Kirk et al. 1969 , Gustin 1979 , Branson and Krysan 1981 , Siegfried and Mullin 1990 , and oviposition is not considered to be dependent upon cues from the larval host plant. Oviposition can occur without the presence of odor or physical cues from corn, even when females are feeding on or around plants that reduce adult longevity (Siegfried and Mullin 1990) . These examples of oviposition in the absence of corn (Kirk et al. 1969 , Gustin 1979 , Branson and Krysan 1981 , Siegfried and Mullin 1990 predate the occurrence of rotation resistance and were reported outside the current range of rotation-resistant D. v. virgifera. In the absence of clear evidence for an attraction to soybean by wild-type D. v. virgifera, adult emigration from corn\u00deelds remains a viable explanation for oviposition in soybean.\nEmigration by adult D. v. virgifera from corn\u00deelds is common. Adults, especially females with mature eggs, have been observed to move from \u00deelds where they emerge and enter rotated corn\u00deelds not having an existing population (Godfrey and Turpin 1983) . Like most Diabrotica species, D. v. virgifera prefers to feed on \u00dforal parts (Krysan 1986) , and \u00dforal volatiles have been shown to be highly attractive (Metcalf 1986) . Later planted (i.e., phenologically younger) corn that \u00dfowers later than surrounding corn\u00deelds can function as a trap crop drawing in large numbers of adult corn rootworms (Hill and Mayo 1974, Naranjo and Sawyer 1994) . Greater numbers of adult D. v. virgifera, especially females are found in late-planted corn\u00deelds than surrounding early planted corn\u00deelds (Darnell et al. 2000) , and individuals have a greater tendency to \u00dfy toward corn of a younger phenological stage (Naranjo 1994) . Volatile components of corn identi\u00deed as attractants (Metcalf 1986 , Hammack 1997 are produced by plants during pollination when silks and tassels are present. These observations suggest D. v. virgifera commonly move in and between corn\u00deelds seeking plants of the most favorable phenological stage for adult feeding. In a landscape of concentrated corn\u00d0soybean rotation where corn is planted with a high degree of synchrony, conditions are conducive for the deposition of D. v. virgifera in soybean.\nThe initial objective of the present research was to determine whether the response of rotation-resistant D. v. virgifera to corn phenology was greater than that of wild-type beetles. We assayed the propensity of adults from the two populations to leave corn during and after anthesis by using a two-chamber emigration arena. We further investigated whether adult attraction to soybean was in\u00dfuenced by corn and soybean volatiles. Using an olfactometer designed after Sammons et al. (1997) , we tested whether adult attraction to soybean volatiles differed for these populations. We then documented how attraction to soybean volatiles was in\u00dfuenced by presence of corn at various growth stages."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": "Insects. Beetles used for experiment 1 were obtained from a laboratory colony maintained at the Northern Grain Insects Laboratory, Brookings, SD. Emerging teneral adults collected over 48 h were sent overnight to Michigan in containers with food (butternut squash and a fructose-glycerine diet) and water. Beetles were delivered on 16 April 2001. Assayed beetles were \u03f714 d old based on adult emergence occurring the day of shipment. These beetles were only used in experiment 1 to validate the design of the emigration assay apparatus. Conclusions based on experiments with laboratory-reared beetles were limited to general inferences about the experimental apparatus and design.\nExperiments 2\u00d05 used beetles collected in east central Illinois and Nebraska. Beetles from Nebraska, where injury to rotated corn has not been reported, were de\u00dened as wild type. Beetles from Illinois, where injury to rotated corn is common, were considered rotation-resistant. To better relate our study to that of Sammons et al. (1997) Sammons et al. (1997) . Nebraska beetles were shipped to Michigan in containers with corn ears, silks, water, and arrived within 48 h of collection. Adults from Illinois were collected from a soybean \u00deeld to ensure the sample population was composed of females likely to oviposit therein. We selected a collection site in Champaign County well known for injury to rotated corn (Spencer et al. 1999 , O\u00d5Neal et al. 2001 , Levine et al. 2002 Ag2201) and corn the \u00derst week of May, and corn every 7\u00d010 d after that until four plantings were established to ensure a supply of vegetative and reproductive-stage corn for the experimental comparisons. All soybean used in the following experiments were from plants in the early reproductive stage (R4 to R5 stage); all plants had \u00dfowers and pods varying from 2 to 5 cm in length. Soybean foliage was presented in the olfactometer as four trifoliates cut \u03f730 cm from the leaf base and placed in a 50-ml Erlenmeyer \u00dfask \u00delled with water.\nTests of adult D. v. virgifera propensity to depart from corn leaves in the emigration assay used corn in early vegetative stage (V6 \u00d0V8 stage, Ritchie et al. 1986 scale, designated \"young leaves\") or late vegetative stage (V14 \u00d0VT stage, Ritchie et al. 1986 , designated \"old leaves\"). Emigration and olfactometer assays used corn from the four planting dates for plants at anthesis (VT\u00d0R1 stage, Ritchie et al. 1986 ) and after anthesis (R3 to R4 stages, Ritchie et al. 1986 ). These two stages of corn are designated young and old, respectively. Tassels cut from early reproductive stage corn (VT, young tassels) were used only while producing pollen. Conversely, tassels from late reproductive stage corn (R2, old tassels) were used only when no longer producing pollen.\nEmigration Assay. An emigration assay arena was constructed with wire screen (7 by 7 strands per square centimeter aluminum mesh) and a cardboard cylinder bottom ( Fig. 1) , divided into an inner and an outer section. To ensure that beetle emigration included \u00dfight, the inner wall of the outer section included a 10-cm Fluon-coated band that beetles could not climb. We measured adult D. v. virgifera emigration from the inner section when in the presence of corn of differing phenologies. The cone-shaped lid of the outer section opened into a clear plastic container (11 cm in height by 8 cm in diameter) to isolate beetles that emigrated from the inner section. Within the inner section, beetles were offered corn leaves or tassels placed within a water-\u00delled, 50-ml Erlenmeyer \u00dfask, sealed at its mouth with Para\u00delm to prevent beetles from entering the \u00dfask. Both tassels and leaves were cut so that 5 cm was sealed within the \u00dfask and 45 cm extended from the \u00dfask. Beetles taken from stock cages were brie\u00dfy chilled for easier handling and then separated by sex based on the shape of the last abdominal sternite (White 1977) . Ten female beetles were placed within the inner section covered with a clear plastic lid. After 60 min, the lid was removed and the outer section sealed. We counted the number of adults within the inner section after 30 min, 3 h, and 24 h. Assays were set up at noon, so that beetles were undisturbed during times of peak \u00dfight activity in the early evening and morning (Witkowski et al. 1975 ). All assays were conducted at room temperature (23 \u03ee 3\u040aC) and a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) h. The location of each emigration assay was randomly assigned within a grid on the bench within the laboratory.\nExperiment 1: Emigration Assay Validation. During spring 2001, we tested our emigration assay with laboratory-reared D. v. virgifera; subsequent studies used only \u00deeld collected beetles (experiments 2\u00d05). We tested whether propensity of adult females to leave the inner section was related to the corn tissue presented. We compared the retention of D. v. virgifera on a surrogate leaf to that of corn tissue (leaf or tassels). This surrogate was constructed from a 6 by 40-cm leaf-shaped section of smooth green cardboard similar in surface area (105 cm 2 ) to the leaf treatments. In each assay, beetles were offered one of \u00deve treatments (surrogate leaf, young corn leaf, old corn leaf, young tassel, and old tassel); the experimental design was a randomized complete block with \u00deve replicates. After 24 h, we counted the number of beetles remaining in the inner section of each assay. Treatment effects were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by least signi\u00decant difference (LSD) for mean separations (SAS Institute 2000). The amount of leaf area eaten during experiment 1 was also measured (O\u00d5Neal et al. 2002b ) for the two leaf treatments. The difference in amount of leaf area consumed between the two leaf treatments was compared using Student\u00d5s t-test with Satterthwaite correction (SAS Institute 2000).\nExperiment 2: Effect of Beetle Origin on Emigration. Using beetles collected in the \u00deeld during the summer of 2001, we looked for differences in behavior of rotation-resistant versus wild-type D. v. virgifera in the emigration arena. Based on the response of adults to corn phenology (O\u00d5Neal et al. 2002a ), we postulated that Illinois beetles would have a greater propensity to leave corn of an advanced phenology than beetles from Nebraska. Old and young tassels were used to represent plants of varying phenologies. Both were tested simultaneously for 24 h; there were seven replicates of each combination of treatment and population of origin. We did not compare young or old corn leaves, because preliminary tests found no difference in the number of Illinois or Nebraska beetles in inner chambers containing these treatments (O\u00d5Neal 2003) .\nWe analyzed data in two separate analyses. The \u00derst accounted for the effect of beetle origin on emigration using ANOVA for a three-way factorial design, with population of origin, time (beetles in inner section after 30 min, 3 h, and 24 h), and plant tissue as treatment factors. The second analysis determined whether both populations preferred either old or young tassels. A mean observed ratio of beetles in the inner to the outer section was calculated for each population of origin and plant tissue combination and compared via chi-square goodness-of-\u00det test (Sokal and Rohlf 1995) to a 1:1 ratio, indicating no preference.\nOlfactometer. We modi\u00deed the olfactometer (Fig.  2) of Sammons et al. (1997) composed of a series of satellite chambers connected to a central chamber by side-arms fashioned from \u00dfexible clear tubing (1.7 cm interior diameter, 11.5 cm in length; Tygon, Fisher Scienti\u00dec, Pittsburgh, PA). Modi\u00decations included a smaller central chamber (8 cm in height, 18.2 cm in diameter), four rather than eight satellite chambers (19 cm in height, 20.0 cm in diameter; TriState Plastics, Dixon, KY), and a sponge (9 by 5.5 cm) saturated with water in each satellite chamber to control for humidity. To ensure that beetles responded only to volatile cues emanating from satellite chambers, the central chamber was wrapped with white cardboard blinds to block any visual cues. Air \u00dfowed at a velocity of 0.5 \u03ee 0.06 liters/min through satellite chambers to the central chamber and then to a vacuum pump (Gast Mfg. Corp., Benton Harbor, MI) attached to the top of the central chamber. The intake hole (3.2 mm in diameter) of each satellite chamber was gauze-covered and opposite the opening to the central chamber (Fig. 2) . All olfactometer tests were conducted at 21\u00d024\u040aC with a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) h, by using female D. v. virgifera. We released 20 \u00d025 female beetles in the central chamber at 1400 hours and recorded their position after 22 h. Before an olfactometer was used, all connecting tubes, inner and outer chambers were washed with soap, rinsed, and dried. The sponges were triple-rinsed and soaked over night in warm water and \u00delled for use with distilled water.\nWe conducted preliminary tests to determine the likelihood of beetle movement from satellite chambers to the central chamber. Fifty beetles were placed in a satellite chamber with only a sponge; only one beetle moved to the empty central chamber in 24 h. We conclude that beetle movement was unidirectional, from the central toward the satellite chambers. Beetles were counted in a satellite chamber if they had moved into the tube connected to the outer chamber. During all olfactometer experiments \u03fd3% of beetles tested were found in the tubes connecting the central and satellite chambers.\nExperiment 3: Attraction of Illinois and Nebraska Beetles to Soybean. To determine whether soybean volatiles were attractive to adult D. v. virgifera, we placed cuttings of soybean foliage and a wet sponge in one randomly selected satellite chamber of the olfactometer. The other three received only a wet sponge. Both populations were tested in two separate olfactometers on three consecutive days for a total of six replicates per population. We summed the number of beetles in each type of satellite chamber and compared the observed distribution to an expected random distribution (0.25:0.75, soybean and sponge: sponge only ratio) by using chi-square goodness-of-\u00det test. In a separate analysis with the same data, we determined whether the responses of Nebraska and Illinois beetles differed. We summed the total in each chamber type across the three days and compared the distribution of beetles from Illinois to those from Nebraska by using a chi-square goodness-of-\u00det test.\nExperiment 4: Attraction of Illinois Beetles to Soybean in the Presence of Old Corn Volatiles. Two satellite chambers contained a tassel and ear of old corn, whereas the remaining two chambers contained soybean foliage. Four replications were run on three separate days, and the location of the plant materials was randomized daily. We summed the number of beetles in each of the satellite chambers and compared the observed distribution to an expected random distribution (1:1, old corn:soybean ratio) by using chisquare goodness-of-\u00det test.\nExperiment 5: Effect of Varying Corn Phenology on Attraction of Illinois Beetles to Soybean. Each of the satellite chambers contained a water-\u00delled sponge and three chambers received one of the following; young corn (tassels and an ear from a plant in anthesis), old corn (tassels and an ear from a postanthesis plant), and soybean. Two con\u00degurations of the olfactometer were conducted simultaneously. In the \u00derst con\u00deguration, all four materials were placed in separate satellite chambers. In the second con\u00deguration, the chamber containing the young corn was replaced with a chamber containing old corn. Each con\u00deguration was tested simultaneously in two replicates on three consecutive days. The location of the plant materials was randomized daily.\nWe used a chi-square goodness-of-\u00det test to determine whether the distribution of beetles in the \u00derst con\u00deguration (both young and old corn present) differed from that of the second con\u00deguration (only old corn present). The distribution of beetles in the \u00derst con\u00deguration was used to calculate an expected distribution for the second con\u00deguration. The expected number of beetles in the old corn of the second con\u00deguration was calculated by adding the number of beetles in chambers with old and young corn from the \u00derst con\u00deguration, dividing by the total tested in the \u00derst con\u00deguration, and then multiplying by the total tested in the second con\u00deguration."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Experiment 1: Emigration Assay Validation. Types of corn tissue or surrogate leaf signi\u00decantly (F \u03ed 7.6, df \u03ed 4, 24; P \u03ed 0.001) affected emigration of adult female D. v. virgifera. The fewest females were found in inner sections with the surrogate leaf (Fig. 3) ; no beetles remained inside the inner section in two of the \u00deve replicates. Young tassels shedding pollen retained more females than old tassels. Although there was no difference in emigration from young and old corn leaves (P \u03ed 0.05; Fig. 3 ), a signi\u00decantly greater leaf area was consumed (t \u03ed 2.78, df \u03ed 4, P \u03ed 0.05) by females on the young leaf (7.94 \u03ee 2.62, mean cm 2 \u03ee SEM) than the old leaf treatment (1.29 \u03ee 0.54).\nExperiment 2: Effect of Beetle Origin on Emigration. As described above, signi\u00decantly greater emigration occurred when beetles were presented with old than young tassels (Fig. 4) , but the origin of the beetles did not affect emigration (P \u03ed 0.74; Table 1 ) at any of the observation times (P \u03ed 0.71; Table 1 ). There was only one signi\u00decant interaction (time by plant, P \u03fd 0.01; Table 1 ), but it was not associated with beetle population of origin. We attribute this interaction to the lack of signi\u00decant differences in beetle emigration from the inner sections until the \u00denal time period (Fig. 4) , which was the case for both populations.\nBeetle distribution between the inner and outer sections differed signi\u00decantly from an expected 1:1 ratio in assays where old tassels were presented (Table 2 ). However, the distribution did not differ from a 1:1 ratio when young tassels were presented to beetles. Beetles from Illinois and Nebraska yielded the same pattern. "}, {"section_title": "Experiment 3: Attraction of Illinois and Nebraska", "text": "Beetles to Soybean. On a per chamber basis, more beetles from both populations moved to satellite chambers with soybean than satellite chambers with only a sponge (Table 3) . There was no difference in response of beetles to soybean due to population of origin (P \u03ed 0.69; Table 3 ).\nExperiment 4: Attraction of Illinois Beetles to Soybean in the Presence of Old Corn Volatiles. Beetle distribution in olfactometers with two satellite chambers containing soybean foliage and two chambers containing old corn ears and tassels was not evenly distributed ( 2 \u03ed 19.95, df \u03ed 1, P \u03fd 0.0001); nearly twice as many female beetles moved to chambers containing old corn than soybean (total in old corn \u03ed 146, total in soybean \u03ed 79). Thus, even old corn was more attractive than soybean.\nExperiment 5: Effect of Varying Corn Phenology on Attraction of Illinois Beetles to Soybean. With young and old corn in the olfactometer (\u00derst con\u00deguration), more beetles found the young corn (Table 4) . When the young corn was replaced with old corn (second con\u00deguration), more beetles were recovered in chambers containing corn than either of the noncorn chambers. However, the distribution of beetles across the four chambers differed between the \u00derst con\u00degura-tion containing both young and old corn and the second con\u00deguration containing only old corn ( 2 \u03ed 28.6, df \u03ed 1, P \u03fd 0.01; Table 4 ). Between the two con\u00degurations, the percentage of beetles found in the chambers without corn (soybean and sponge alone) doubled (13% in the \u00derst con\u00deguration versus 27% in the second con\u00deguration).

Hence, the following discussion focuses only on explanatory models invoking behavioral change. Nevertheless, other causal mechanisms, such as a delay in the emergence of adult D. v. virgifera (O\u00d5Neal 2003) , should be considered along with those below."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "A genetically based behavioral change model has been offered to explain increased D. v. virgifera oviposition in soybean (Sammons et al. 1997; Onstad et al. 1999 Onstad et al. , 2001 Levine et al. 2002) . Our interpretation of this conceptual model is that a change in the behavior of D. v. virgifera in east central Illinois would lead to an increase of injury to rotated corn and that this modi\u00deed behavior has a genetic basis. The report by Sammons et al. (1997) that Illinois beetles were more attracted to soybean than were Nebraska (wild-type) beetles provided initial evidence for the genetically based behavioral change model. Unable to corroborate the Sammons et al. (1997 ) result, Spencer et al. (1999 proposed that decreased \u00dedelity for corn could be the altered behavior arising from the selection pressure of a corn\u00d0soybean rotated landscape. This new behavior was thought advantageous to rotationresistant D. v. virgifera populations, and its occurrence was explained by a single-locus genetic model (Onstad et al. 2001) . A logical prediction of the genetically based behavioral change model is that the genotype would spread geographically like any adaptive trait (e.g., insecticide resistance gene) carried by insects with substantial capacity to disperse by \u00dfying. Onstad et al. (1999) suggested the geographic spread in the occurrence of large numbers of D. v. virgifera in soybean has been consistent with the spread expected for a rotation resistance gene arising in east central Illinois. An additional prediction of this model would be that rotation resistance is irreversible or at best slowly reversible once the variant genotype becomes \u00dexed in a given geographical location with a susceptible landscape structure.\nBased largely on outcomes of the experiments presented here, we propose another possible explanation for the phenomenon of D. v. virgifera oviposition in soybean. The phenological asynchrony behavioral plasticity model acknowledges increased oviposition in soybean in areas of strict corn\u00d0soybean rotation. However, we suggest the altered behavior is caused by a decrease in attractiveness of corn relative to soybean that, in turn, is due to changing agricultural practices (early planting, variety selection) that result in more phenologically mature corn at an earlier time in the growing season. Thus, when adult D. v. virgifera are most abundant at their usual developmental time, corn in a more advanced phenological state attracts and retains fewer beetles. Like the genetically based behavioral change model, the phenological asynchrony behavioral plasticity model predicts increased beetle visitation of and oviposition in soybean, leading to corn damage the following season. But, the phenological asynchrony behavioral plasticity model differs from the genetically based behavioral change model a Each olfactometer was arranged with one satellite chamber containing soybean foliage and sponge and three containing only a sponge.\nb Total beetles in each treatment (soybean or sponge) is summed from two replicates on three consecutive days in which 20 to 25 beetles were released per olfactometer.\nc Expected number of beetles is calculated for comparing distributions of beetles within an olfactometer assuming no attraction to soybean and an equal distribution across the four chambers resulting in a 0.25:0.75 ratio.\nd Comparison between populations was performed by comparing the distribution of Illinois (observed) to Nebraska (expected) beetles. a Total beetles in each con\u00deguration is summed from two olfactometers on three consecutive days in which 20 to 25 beetles were released. b Expected number of beetles is calculated based on the distribution observed in the \u00derst con\u00deguration. The number of beetles observed in the young and old corn chambers combined to calculate an expected old corn observation for the second con\u00deguration. There was a signi\u00decant difference between the observed and expected distribution for the second con\u00deguration ( 2 \u03ed 28.6, df \u03ed 1, P \u03fd 0.01).\nby not requiring a genetic shift in D. v. virgifera genotype. Rather, behavior inherent within the bounds of behavioral plasticity of the original genotype is suf\u00decient to increase oviposition in soybean. The phenological asynchrony behavioral plasticity model predicts 1) no difference in the behaviors of Illinois and Nebraska D. v. virgifera encountering identical corn or soybean stimuli; 2) the timing of and geographical pattern for spread of rotation failure would be highly correlated with that for landscape structure permitting its expression; and 3) rotation failure would be reversible upon reversion to the landscape structure and phenological synchrony that preceded D. v. virgifera injury to rotated corn. Fit of Current Data to Respective Models. This study was directed both at whether differences could be found between plant-induced behaviors of Illinois (rotation-resistant) versus Nebraska (wildtype) D. v. virgifera, and whether beetles responded differently to corn varying in phenological state. Although the emigration assay detected large differences in behavioral responses to surrogate versus authentic plant material (Fig. 3 ) and clear differences between young and old corn tassels ( Fig. 4 ; Table 1), we found no effects of beetle origin (Table 1) .\nOur side-arm olfactometer tests revealed Illinois and Nebraska beetles were equally attracted to soybean (Table 3 ). This outcome contradicts the results of Sammons et al. (1997) who reported that Illinois beetles were 2.7-fold more attracted to soybean than were beetles from Nebraska. This difference in outcomes is particularly striking because both studies used the same apparatus, and a similar population to represent wild-type D. v. virgifera. However, we did modify the design and protocol of Sammons et al. (1997) olfactometer by reducing the number of satellite chambers, only using plant material, and testing only female beetles. We suggest that these modi\u00deca-tions should have aided in measuring an attraction for soybean by rotation-resistant D. v. virgifera. Our only signi\u00decant departure in methodology was inclusion a water-saturated sponge in the satellite chambers to control for relative humidity. The current \u00dendings, considered together with those of Spencer et al. (1999) and O\u00d5Neal et al. (2002a) , leads to the tentative conclusion that there currently are no data directly supporting a signi\u00decant genetic-based shift of behavior. The indirect evidence of Onstad et al. (1999 Onstad et al. ( , 2001 for the genetically based behavioral change model is not discounted. But, evaluation of the strength of this indirect evidence based on pattern of geographic spread of rotation failure awaits partitioning of that effect between two possible causes: spread of agricultural practices (reduced diversity in the landscape and changes in corn phenology) that allow expression of preexisting behavior versus spread of a resistant genotype.\nRecognizing the potential high impact of phenological asynchrony between beetles and corn, O\u00d5Neal et al. (2002a) built on Spencer et al.\u00d5s (1999) proposal that a rotation-resistant D. v virgifera population might differ from the wild type in heightened propensity to leave old corn, i.e., reduced corn \u00dedelity. However, the current data are incongruent with this hypothesis; emigration of Illinois beetles was not greater than that of Nebraska beetles in our laboratory assay (Fig. 4) . The response of both beetle populations was consistent with the mechanism proposed by O\u00d5Neal et al. (2002a) for oviposition of D. v. vigifera within soybean \u00deelds. That is, adults readily emigrate from corn at an advanced phenological state to whatever \u00deelds are nearby. In fact, slightly more than half of the beetles placed in the inner chamber of emigration assay with corn of an optimal phenological state left the optimal host and moved to the outer chamber within 24 h. For old corn, the ratio of beetles leaving versus staying in the inner chamber was \u03fe4:1. Thus, old tassels are indeed less arrestive than young tassels, lending credence to the idea that corn phenology can in\u00dfuence beetle movement.\nUnable to identify a rotation-resistant D. v. virgifera as evidenced by greater emigration from old corn ( Fig. 4 ; Table 2), we quanti\u00deed the attraction of Illinois beetles to young and old corn relative to soybean (Table 4) . Expressed as fold increase over response to a wet sponge, attractiveness of young corn, old corn, and soybean was 23, 6.6, and 3.7, respectively. Equivalent values for the test with only old corn and soybean presented with a wet sponge (Table 4) were 4.4 and 2.2, respectively. Thus, soybean seems to be approximately one-half as attractive as old corn, but less than one-sixth as attractive as young corn in the side-arm olfactometer. Moreover, when young corn was removed as one of the choices, leaving only old corn as host material (experiment 5), the number of beetles collected in chambers with a nonhost (soybean or sponge) rose signi\u00decantly. We conclude that volatiles from old corn are indeed less attractive to adult D. v. virgifera than volatiles from young corn and that substituting old for young corn could increase visitation to nearby soybean plants.\nCollectively, our data are not supportive of the genetically based behavioral change model for rotation failure. No direct evidence was obtained for any difference in behavior of Illinois versus Nebraska D. v. virgifera. Current data are consistent with the phenological asynchrony behavioral plasticity model, which is based on inherit behavioral plasticity of beetles from both populations. Differentiating between these explanatory models awaits either 1) convincing evidence for meaningful genetic change between Illinois versus wild-type beetles, or 2) testing of new predictions from the genetically based behavioral change and phenological asynchrony behavioral plasticity models that do not overlap. A prediction consistent with the phenological asynchrony behavioral plasticity model and inconsistent with the genetically based behavioral change model is reversal of rotation resistance if synchrony of adult D. v. virgifera peak activity with optimal corn phenology for adults\u00d5 is restored.\nThe initial geographic spread of D. v. virgifera displaying behaviors associated with injury to rotated corn (Onstad et al. 1999 ) can be used as evidence supporting the genetically based behavioral change model. Recently, the role of reduced landscape diversity has been shown to play a signi\u00decant role in determining the range of D. v. virgifera displaying behaviors associated with rotation resistance (Onstad et al. 2003) . The practice of a corn\u00d0soybean rotation is very high in east central Illinois, a region whose farm landscape is \u03fe90% corn and soybean (USDA Census of Agriculture data summarized in Onstad et al. 2003) . This lack of landscape diversity is unique to east central Illinois and can help explain why injury to rotated corn originated in this part of the state. However, landscape diversity alone does not explain how D. v. virgifera has come to use soybean as an oviposition site. A corollary to our last prediction is that the agroecosystem of a region where injury to rotated corn is common, such as east central Illinois, would also have a high degree of asynchronony between corn and D. v. virgifera phenology. As suggested by the phenological asynchrony behavioral plasticity model, a combination of reduced landscape diversity and asynchrony between corn and D. v. virgifera phenology is required to produce signi\u00decant D. v. virgifera oviposition in soybean. To what degree the synchrony between corn and D. v. virgifera phenology in east central Illinois differs from that of the rest of the Corn Belt is not well understood.\nUntil such de\u00denitive data are obtained, we would argue that the phenological asynchrony behavioral plasticity model realizes an advantage over the genetically based behavioral change model due to simplicity. Both models invoke changes in landscape structure over time. However, the phenological asynchrony behavioral plasticity model does not require a genetic transformation in the beetle population; the mechanism of phenological asynchrony evoking already inherent behaviors seems suf\u00decient to explain the phenomenon. For these reasons, we urge that both of these models be given due consideration, along with possible unforeseen alternatives, because answers are sought to the phenomenon of D. v. virgifera injury to rotated corn."}]
