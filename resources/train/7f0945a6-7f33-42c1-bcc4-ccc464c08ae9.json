[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "It is important to consider overall health and prognosis when considering cancer screening decisions in older patients. 1,2 For example, screening colonoscopy is the dominant screening modality for colorectal cancer. 3 Evidence from observational studies suggests that few polyps will form and progress to cancer in fewer than 10 years. 4 In addition, complications related to colonoscopy are more common in those with significant comorbidities or advanced age. 5 Thus, older patients with limited life expectancy are at risk of harm from screening or treatment of a condition that may never manifest in their lifetime. 6,7 For these reasons, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has recommended against routine screening for colorectal cancer in those aged 75-84 and against any screening in those above 85. 8 The task force reasoned that, with the limited life expectancy of those over age 75, \"the gain in life years associated with extending screening [above age 75] was small in comparison to the risks of screening\". Others and we have reported on potential overuse of screening colonoscopies in those over age 75 and over 85. [9][10][11] However, the chronological age of the patient is less relevant than life expectancy, or whether the patient can expect to survive long enough after the test to reap benefits that outweigh the risks. [12][13][14] Recently, we developed an algorithm estimating life expectancy in older Medicare patients that is substantially more accurate than using age alone. 15 In this study, we estimate life expectancy in Medicare recipients who underwent screening colonoscopy in 2008-2010 in the US, and report on the proportion of patients who had a life expectancy of less than 10 years. We also analyze how this proportion varies by patient and provider characteristics and by geographic location."}, {"section_title": "Material and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Source", "text": "Claims from years 2007 to 2010 for a 5% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries were used, including Medicare beneficiary summary files, Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MedPAR) files, Outpatient Standard Analytical File (OutSAF) and Medicare Carrier files.

For OutSAF data, the following ICD-9-CM codes were also used: 45. 23, 45.25, 45.27, 45.41, 45.42 and 45.43. We linked the colonoscopy claims from the Carrier files to the admission records in the MedPAR files so as to identify and remove inpatient colonoscopies. We identified 435,452 outpatient colonoscopies but used only the first colonoscopy for each beneficiary in 2008-2010, resulting in 392,985 colonoscopies. From these, we excluded beneficiaries aged 65 and younger (N=79,625), those without complete Parts A and B enrollment, and those with any health maintenance organization (HMO) enrollment in the 12 months prior to colonoscopy (N=30,274), leaving 283,086 colonoscopies performed in as many patients. We then identified colonoscopies performed for the purpose of colon cancer screening, defined as outpatient colonoscopies without a possible indication. A colonoscopy was excluded when the patient had: anemia, GI bleeding, abdominal pain, constipation, change in bowel habits or other relevant diagnoses on the colonoscopy claim; a barium enema or abdominal computerized tomographic scan; or a diagnosis of diverticulitis, anemia, GI bleeding, change in bowel habits or other relevant diagnosis in the three months before the colonoscopy (see Appendix for full list). 10 Of the 283,086 colonoscopies analyzed, 57,597 were identified as screening colonoscopies.

The C statistics for the models predicting 10-year mortality are 0.77 and 0.80 for men and women, respectively. Among men who had less than 10 years of life expectancy predicted by this algorithm, 74.3% actually died within 10 years.

The chisquare test was used to examine differences in proportions by patient characteristics. The Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to examine the trend in proportions by education. To examine how patient and provider characteristics impact this proportion, hierarchical generalized linear models were used. These models account for the clustering of beneficiaries within colonoscopists. The correlation of HRR characteristics with the proportion of patients with limited life expectancy in the HRR was examined by Pearson correlation test and Pearson partial correlation test, controlling for gender (% female) and age (% aged 75 or older) in the HRR. The map showing the proportion of beneficiaries with less than 10 years of life expectancy in HRRs was constructed using ArcMap 9.3. Data were not shown for the 8 HRRs with fewer than 30 screening colonoscopies. All other analyses were performed with SAS version 9.2 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC). To further explore the impact of gender, we examined the screening colonoscopy prevalence rate in 2008-2010 by gender. We selected beneficiaries aged 67 or older in 2010 with complete Parts A and B enrollment and without any HMO enrollment for the three years (36 months) from 2008 to 2010 (N=1,125,863). Then we identified those with any screening colonoscopy in this period based on the aforementioned definition, stratified by age and gender."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The cohort included 57,597 Medicare beneficiaries aged 66 years and above who received at least one screening colonoscopy in 2008-2010. Of these, we estimated that 24.8% had less than 10 years of life expectancy at the time of screening colonoscopy. Patient characteristics associated with having an estimated life expectancy of less than 10 years at the time of index screening colonoscopy are listed in Table 2. Those who had limited life expectancy at time of screening colonoscopy were more likely to be male and be eligible for Medicaid. Figure 1 shows the percentage of patients with life expectancy less than 10 years among those receiving a screening colonoscopy for each HRR in 2008-2010. There was considerable variation, from \u226535% in the top five percent of HRRs to below 17% in the bottom five percent. The highest rates (>40%) were seen in New Brunswick and Newark, NJ and Odessa, TX; Stockton, CA had the lowest rate of 5.7%. Table 3 presents patient and health care provider characteristics associated with the likelihood of having less than 10 years of life expectancy at the time of colonoscopy. For this analysis we used multilevel modeling to account for the clustering of outcomes at the level of the colonoscopist. We present two models: Model 1, which was adjusted for patient characteristics, and Model 2, which was adjusted for both patient and provider characteristics. The likelihood of having a limited life expectancy at the time of screening colonoscopy was significantly higher among patients eligible for Medicaid. The likelihood also increased with the number of years the provider was in practice. There was a weak association with colonoscopy volume of the provider, and when the colonoscopist was a surgeon as compared to a gastroenterologist. There were no significant associations with provider gender or whether their medical school training was in United States. In the models in Table 3, we assessed the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) at the level of the colonoscopist. The ICC was 2.7% for Model 1 and 2.5% for Model 2, indicating that variation among colonoscopists contributed relatively little to the variation in whether a patient receiving screening colonoscopy had limited life expectancy. In both unadjusted (Table 2) and adjusted (Table 3) analyses, patient gender was a strong predictor, with men having a two-fold higher probability of having a limited life expectancy at the time of screening colonoscopy than women (e.g., Odds Ratio, 2.25, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 2.16-2.34). Two factors contribute to this gender difference. First, at any age, men were more likely to undergo screening colonoscopy than women. Second, men at any age who undergo screening colonoscopy were more likely than women to have limited life expectancy. This is illustrated in Figure 2, which plots the rates of screening colonoscopy for men and women as a function of age, and also the percent of patients with a life expectancy less than 10 years. For example, at age 68, the rate of screening colonoscopy for men and women were 8.7% and 7.1%, respectively, while the proportions of recipients with limited life expectancy were 4.0% and 0.6% respectively. At age 75, the screening colonoscopy rates in men and women were 7.6% and 5.5% respectively, while the proportion of screening colonoscopy recipients with limited life expectancy were 36.2% and 10.8%, respectively. We also explored whether the geographical variation shown in Figure 1 reflected patterns in overall health care utilization across HRRs or the availability of colonoscopists. There was a significant positive association between total Medicare per capita costs in HRRs and the proportion of patients with limited life expectancy at the time of screening colonoscopy (R=0.25, P<0.001, Pearson correlation test). We did not find significant associations between the number of colonoscopists in an HRR and the percent of screening colonoscopy recipients with limited life expectancy (R=\u22120.10, P=0.08 for any colonoscopist and R=0.02, P=0.71 for gastroenterology colonoscopists, Pearson correlation test). We repeated this analysis after adjusting for gender and age composition in HRRs and found similar results."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "One quarter of Medicare beneficiaries aged 66+ years who underwent screening colonoscopy in 2008-2010 had an estimated life expectancy of less than 10 years at the time of screening. Men were considerably more likely than women to have limited life expectancy at the time of screening. There was also considerable geographical variation in the proportion of screening colonoscopy recipients having life expectancy. The use of life expectancy as a cutoff to decide when to stop screening produces different estimates of potential overuse than the use of an age cutoff. For example, USPSTF guidelines do not recommend routine colorectal cancer screening in patients aged 75-84 years. Approximately 40% of individuals in this age group had an estimated life expectancy of more than 10 years. Conversely, 5.9% of those 65-74 had an estimated life expectancy of less than 10 years. The rate of inappropriate screening colonoscopy varied by endoscopist specialty and the number of years the provider was in practice. Screening colonoscopy guidelines were updated in 2008 to include a stop age for screening. 8 Physicians who are further out of training or non-gastroenterology endoscopists are less likely to be exposed to these recent recommendations. Measures to improve dissemination of updated guidelines may improve compliance with these recommendations. The geographical differences in proportion of screening colonoscopy recipients having limited life expectancy were not explained by colonoscopist availability suggesting that restricting number of colonoscopists is unlikely to decrease overuse. The gender differences in life expectancy are not reflected in the screening rates. At each age, men were more likely to be screened, and men screened were substantially more likely to have an estimated life expectancy of <10 years than women screened. Prior studies have shown that men are more likely than women to undergo screening colonoscopy. 20 This finding may reflect the somewhat higher age-adjusted incidence of colorectal cancer in men. 21 Other factors could include physician gender bias in recommending the procedure and greater concerns among women about the procedure. [22][23][24] For example, lack of availability of a female colonoscopist may lower acceptance among women. 22 Providers find it difficult to integrate age and co-morbidities into estimates of life expectancy. 25,26 Indeed, physicians receive little exposure in their training to estimating life expectancy. 27 Another factor may be the recent modifications in recommendations about colorectal cancer. In addition, people with multiple co-morbidities (and therefore lower life expectancy) are more likely to visit multiple providers, which increase the chances of receiving testing. 28 Prior research found that individuals with multiple co-morbidities and limited life expectancy also undergo routine screening for breast and prostate cancer, suggesting a widespread issue in decision-making in preventive care. 29,30 A common factor among all these tests may be an over-estimation among the general public about their benefits. 31,32 For our analysis, we defined screening colonoscopy by excluding procedures accompanied by a diagnosis on the claim or in the previous three months suggesting an indication other than screening. We chose this strategy instead of using the CPT code for screening colonoscopy because endoscopists continued to use diagnosis codes for screening colonoscopy after Medicare started reimbursing for screening colonoscopy in 2001. For example, in 2007-2008, although an estimated two-thirds of colonoscopies performed on Medicare beneficiaries were for screening, only 14.6% were submitted using screening codes. 33 The biological evidence for screening colonoscopy is based on the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. The progression rate of adenomatous polyps to cancer is low, an estimated 2.5 polyps per 1000 per year. 34 Investigators at the Mayo Clinic found that, even for polyps more than 1 cm in size, the rate of conversion to cancer was 2.5% at 5 years and 8% at 10 years. 35 The average time lag is approximately 4.8 years between development of cancer and onset of clinical symptoms. 36 Indirect evidence from case-control and observational studies shows that the protective effect of screening colonoscopy lasts for at least 10 years. 37,38 Therefore, few patients with life expectancy of less than 10 years are likely to benefit from a screening colonoscopy. We used a predictive algorithm that included age, gender and comorbidity. The model had good predictive discrimination in a validation study, with approximately 75% of those with an estimated life expectancy of less than 10 years actually dying within 10 years. 15 A major criticism of prognostic indexes is that they lack precision at the level of the individual. 2 However, cancer screening recommendations are based on risks and benefits at the population level. 31,32 There are some limitations to our study. The algorithm used to identify screening colonoscopies may also catch surveillance colonoscopies, and this may have led to slight overestimation of inappropriate use of screening colonoscopy. However, many of surveillance colonoscopies are follow up exams for negative screening or low risk adenomas, and the American Gastroenterology Association guidelines published in 2012 recommend deciding about surveillance in context of life expectancy. 39,40 Few people with limited life expectancy stand to gain from surveillance colonoscopy. We did not include flexible sigmoidoscopy in the algorithm because if a flexible sigmoidoscopy triggered a colonoscopy for colitis, cancer, gastrointestinal bleeding etc, the colonoscopy will not be considered as screening. If adenoma detected on flexible sigmoidoscopy lead to a colonoscopy, it will be captured, as we did not exclude ICD-9-CM codes for history of colon or rectal polyps. We could not capture information regarding confounders for colorectal cancer risk such as family history, smoking and obesity. There is also the possibility of coding inaccuracies and misclassification. However, it is unlikely that these limitations explain the main study finding or the wide geographical or gender variation in results. In summary, nearly 25% of patients receiving screening colonoscopy had limited life expectancy a time of screening, especially men. This represents a substantial proportion of colonoscopy workload and Medicare expenditure. There is a need to educate both physicians and the general public about the importance of life expectancy in determining the riskbenefit ratio for preventive screening.
