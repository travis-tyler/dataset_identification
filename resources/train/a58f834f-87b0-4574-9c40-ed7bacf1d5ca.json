[{"section_title": "", "text": "A pproximately 632,700 graduate students were enrolled in science, engineering, and health (SEH) programs in the United States as of fall 2010, a 30% increase from approximately 493,300 students in 2000, according to the National Science Foundation's (NSF's) Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering (GSS). The growth in first-time, full-time (FTFT) graduate student enrollment in science and engineering (S&E) programs over this time was even greater, with a 50% increase from approximately 78,400 students in 2000 to approximately 118,500 students in 2010 (figure 1). Due to the extra variability that may have resulted from the methodological changes in the 2007 GSS, all growth rate calculations comparing pre-and post-2007 counts are rounded to the nearest 5%. See \"Data Sources and Limitations\" for more information. Continuing the decade-long trend, overall graduate enrollment in S&E reached a new peak in 2010, with 407,291 students in science fields and 149,241 students in engineering fields (table 1). However, rates of growth in these fields slowed considerably between 2009 and 2010 from the two previous years-particularly in FTFT enrollment, which had only a 1.7% gain in science programs and 4.0% gain in engineering programs. Annual increases in 2007-08 and 2008-09 for FTFT graduate enrollment were 7.6% and 6.4% in science and 8.2% and 6.2% in engineering, respectively (figure 1).

As a result, women's share of graduate S&E enrollment also rose over this period (41.2% in 2000 to 43.2% in 2010, peaking at 44.0% in 2007). The slight drop in the women's share since 2007 has been due to the faster rise in men's S&E graduate enrollment (9.4% for men versus 5.8% for women). Over the last decade S&E graduate enrollment grew at the same rate for U.S. citizens and permanent residents and for temporary visa holders, both increasing by 35% (table 2). However, among U.S. citizens and permanent resident graduate students, S&E enrollment for students in underrepresented minority groups, except for Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islanders, grew at a much higher rate than for whites not of Hispanic origin or Asians. Over the last decade S&E graduate enrollment by Hispanic/Latino students, American Indian/Alaska Native students, and black/African American students not of Hispanic origin grew by approximately 65%, 55%, and 50%, respectively. 3"}, {"section_title": "Enrollment Status", "text": "Full-time graduate student enrollment in S&E grew at a higher rate (approximately 40%) than part-time enrollment (approximately 20%) between 2000 and 2010. The number of FTFT S&E graduate students went up by approximately 50% over the decade, increasing annually except for a brief period of decline in 2004-05, which was primarily driven by the mid-decade dip in engineering enrollment (figure 1). Annual growth in FTFT S&E graduate enrollment slowed in 2010 to its lowest level since 2004-05.

"}, {"section_title": "Postdoctoral Appointees in S&E", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Sources and Limitations", "text": "This publication provides the first release of data from the fall 2010 cycle of the GSS, which collected data from 13,711 organizational units (departments, programs, affiliated research centers, and health care facilities) at 574 institutions of higher education and their affiliates in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Guam. The institutional response rate was 99.3%. An overview of the survey objectives and design can be found at http://www.nsf. gov/statistics/srvygradpostdoc/. The GSS collects data on graduate students, postdocs, and other doctorateholding non-faculty researchers in research-oriented SEH fields. Practitioner-oriented degrees within these fields (e.g., master's degrees in nursing and physical therapy) are not eligible for the GSS. Declines in psychology and other health fields in 2008-10 are likely due to more rigorous follow-up with institutions regarding the exclusion of practitioner-oriented graduate degree programs. These decreases may not reflect changes in actual enrollments, and care should be used when examining long-term trends. In 2010 the postdoc section of the survey was expanded and significant effort was made to ensure that appropriate personnel were providing postdoc data (see http://www.nsf.gov/ statistics/srvygradpostdoc/ for more information). As a result, it is unclear how much of the increase reported in 2010 represents growth in postdoctoral appointments and how much results from improved data collection. More information on the improved data collection and changes in postdoc data will be released in a forthcoming Info-Brief, which will be available at http:// www.nsf.gov/statistics/gradpostdoc/. The full set of detailed statistical tables from this survey will be available in the forthcoming report Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering: Fall 2010 at http:// www.nsf.gov/statistics/gradpostdoc/. Individual detailed tables may be available upon request in advance of the full report by contacting the author. Due to methodological changes in 2007, the data collected from 2007 through 2010 are not strictly comparable to those collected prior to 2007. As a result, care should be used when assessing trends within the GSS data. In this InfoBrief, \"2007new\" reports the data as collected in 2007 and \"2007old\" provides data as they would have been collected in 2006. Ten-year trends reported in the tables are labeled \"% change 2000-10.\" Note that these percentages are rounded to the nearest 5% to reflect the extra variability in the estimate that may have resulted from the methodological changes that occurred in 2007.
