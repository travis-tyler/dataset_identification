[{"section_title": "", "text": "first among equals.\" Others (Arrow, Jensen and Meckling, Tirole) distinguish organizational economics as a form of nonequilibriumanalysis, nonperfect-rationality, and nonprofitmaximizing behavior relative to traditional economics. Barney posits that organizational economics is bound together by two commonalities. The first is an abiding interest in the structure, functioning, and role of organizations as opposed to solely an interest in the structure, functioning, and role of markets; the second is an emphasis on the dynamic relationships between competition and organizations. This focus on organizations, their origins and consequences, and rivalry has generated a large and complex interdisciplinary literature. This literature is divided into the original three streams of focus-transaction cost economics, agency theory, and property-rights theoryand two more firm-specific subfields-the behavioral theory of the firm and resourcebased/dynamic capabilities approach. A brief description of the original three allows us to place them into a context for analyzing the concept of agroindustrialization and the evolution of applied organizational economic research. Transaction-cost economics differs from neoclassical theories of the firm and traditional price analysis in six basic forms. These include (a) behavioral assumptions, mainly opportunism and bounded rationality; (b) unit of analysis is the transaction, not the firm, or industry, or individual; (c) the firm as a governance structure, not a production function; (d) property rights that are problematic and costly to enforce; (e) discrete structural (getting basic alignments right) rather than marginal modes of analysis lend to emphasis on first-order economizing rather than secondorder refinements; and (f ) all relevant comparisons are made with feasible alternatives, so the relevant criterion is remediableness (Williamson, 1996). Transaction-cost economics argues that economizing on transaction costs is mainly responsible for the choice of one form of organization over another (Williamson, 1988). Consequently, it applies this hypothesis to a wide range of phenomena-vertical market restrictions; vertical integration-disintegration; corporate governance; finance; and, more generally, any issue that can be posed as a contracting problem. Agency theory is directed at the relationship in which one party (principal) delegates work to another (agent) who performs that work. Two common problems are encountered in principal-agent relationships. The first is the \"agency problem\" that arises when (a) the desires or goals of the principal and the agent conflict and (b) asymmetric information makes it difficult or expensive for the principal to verify the agent's actions. The second is the problem of risk sharing that arises when the principal and the agent have different attitudes toward risk and alternative incentive arrangements in contracts change the agent's risk position. The key idea within agency theory is that principal-agent relationships should reflect efficient information and risk-bearing costs, incentive alignments, and the contract as the unit of analysis. Given agency problems, we cannot expect a firm to function as well economically as it would if all information were shared without any cost involved or if the incentives of principal and agent could be cost aligned. This shortfall is called agency costs. Agency theory addresses problems of moral hazard and adverse selection in the principal-agent relationship, as well as the problem of risk sharing. Traditional property-rights theory using three criteria-universality, exclusivity, and transferability-analyzes the relationship between economic efficiency and property rights. Building on this neoclassical framework, Grossman and Hart, Hart and Moore, Hart, and Barzell develop an organizational economics framework that addresses the issue of \"why does ownership matter?\" Their answer postulates that ownership is a source of power when contracts are incomplete. They further our understanding of enterprise ownership by introducing the concept that possession of residual-control rights is the definition of ownership. Moreover, residual rights are reflected by the incidence of residual risk bearing. In financial contracting, for example, higher leverage by borrowers may induce riskier behavior, so that contracts are written yielding greater control and even eventual shift in ownership of the borrower's assets to the lender, thus protecting the latter's property rights. As organizational economics has matured, elements of these three focus areas have increasingly been synthesized and concurrently employed to elucidate, explain, and improve organizational decision making. An example is provided by the case of a large, multioperator agricultural production firm that (a) has an agency relationship with one or more lenders in which monitoring by lenders and signaling by borrowers are key elements of the financial contract, (b) engages in specialty-crop contract production on leased land with a fixed cash rent rather than crop shares in order to protect the firm's property rights to the premium income, and (c) has brought in-house accounting, legal, marketing, and harvesting services in order to reduce transaction costs. Interrelationships among these agency, property-rights, and transaction-cost elements are important to consider and measure in empirical analyses. The cost, availability, and other terms of external capital, for example, may respond favorably to the specialty crop contract although the financial risk and tenure concerns of cash leasing and the risks provided by variable incentive arrangements could be mutually offsetting. Similarly, the in-house, transactioncost-reducing services could signify a credible commitment to the process offering the production contract and provide for further reductions in credit risk by lenders. Under extreme adversity, the respective contractors could each vie for recovery of their loans, specialty crop, and wages based on the terms and legal status of the contracts. These three increasingly mainstream theoretical schools dominate the organizational economic literature. Applying these theories to food system analysis is addressed in the next section of this article. Barry (1999Barry ( , 1993, utilizing two cases and an extended example, encourages the agricultural economics profession to incorporate organizational economics concepts into its education and research programs. His arguments are consistent with Cook and Chaddad's comparative study of development and agribusiness economic approaches to analysis of coordination and motivation costs resulting from the increased economic specialization accompanying the agroindustrialization process. They also posit that organization theories would be powerful concepts to inform the debate. Examples are market-power-induced intrafirm strategic and structural design decisions versus the argument that agroindustrialization is exogenously determined and exchanges are organized by means of transaction-costminimizing governance structures."}, {"section_title": "Organizational Economics Applied to Food System Analysis", "text": "One of the constraints of advancing these concepts into more useful analytical tools has been the challenge of empirical validation. Agency and transaction costs are more difficult to measure than traditional production costs and encompass activities, such as compiling and transmitting information, time delays caused by more inter-and intrafirm centralized decision making, maladaptation costs created by inaccurate information, and imperfect commitment costs. The remainder of this article introduces three \"critical mass\" efforts in their challenging attempts to operationalize organizational economics concepts into policy and strategy applications. The M\u00e9nard and Klein article introduces the work of the Center for Analytical Theory of Organization and Markets (ATOM) at the University of Paris, France, which has been coordinating cross-border food system analysis utilizing an organizational economic framework. Stressing discrete structural analysis to understand vertical integration and network studies, the authors highlight the understanding of institutional environments as generators of the evolution of path-dependent governance structures. Given the food trade policy frictions in the agricultural sector of the World Trade Organization sponsored liberalization talks, this article lays the groundwork for why and how organizational economics might inform the forthcoming tradepolicy outputs. The MacDonald, Ahearn, and Banker article contributes to this session very effectively. The authors expand on previous work regarding the economic and policy implications of agroindustrialization. They provide numerous examples of the increasing role organizational economics can play in analyzing agricultural-policy issues. They highlight distinctive characteristics of the farm-household farm-business organizational relationship, utilize components of organizational economics to inform domestic agricultural policy, cite the use of the Agricultural Resource Management Survey in applying organizational economics to agriculture, and discuss the challenges of updating and improving the database to make it more \"organizational economics friendly.\" Their discussion clearly shows why agency relationships, governance structures, and transaction-cost economics do not support a \"one-size-fits-all\" agricultural policy. This article will be cited often and deservedly so as the agricultural-economics profession seeks conceptual frameworks and databases relevant for informing domestic agricultural and environmental policy. The Sykuta and James article highlights the intrafirm and interfirm decision making and coordination value of organizational economics in agrifood studies. Initially, the authors provide a brief description as to the increased utilization of organizational economic concepts as measured by American Journal of Agricultural Economics and \"Research Assessment Exercise\" keyword references over the past ten years. Additionally, the authors provide an informative literature review of organizational economics research in agribusiness comparing intrafirm and interfirm agribusiness research. Building on their review of the literature, the authors outline a challenging research agenda for the agribusiness researcher who is addressing structural, behavioral, and economic performance changes in the food system. They complement the MacDonald, Ahearn, and Banker article by calling for problem-theorydata collection systems that are more organizational economics friendly. They conclude with a description of the objectives and workings of a major interdisciplinary research effort that emphasizes the importance of data collection and preparation-the Contracting and Organization Research Institute (CORI) based at the University of Missouri, Columbia."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "The purpose of this article and session is to highlight the growing importance of organizational economics in the realm of applied economics and to document examples of its value in traditional agricultural-economic settings. The session introduces the broad applicability and versatility of organizational economics by use of cross-border institutional environment analysis, application to domestic agricultural and environmental policy making, and its effectiveness when utilized in analyzing the dynamics of intrafirm and interfirm agribusiness decision making. Each of the articles argues that the challenges for more powerful applications and relevance are heavily dependent on more sophisticated data development and data collection systems. The articles go beyond the \"problem-identification\" stage to share examples of organizational models and initiatives (ATOM, CORI, and U.S. Department of Agriculture) that provide \"solutions\" to the application of organizational economics in food, agribusiness, and agricultural-economics research."}]
