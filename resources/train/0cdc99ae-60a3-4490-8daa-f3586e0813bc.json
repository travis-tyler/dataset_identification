Centered approximately at Lat. 29\uf045 40' 00\" N and Long. 92\uf045 18' 00\" W, the area is bounded on the north by the old Intracoastal Waterway (Schooner Bayou), on the west by LA Hwy 82 and the Acadiana Marina Canal, on the south by Humble Canal (Acadiana Marina Canal), and on the east by Freshwater Bayou Canal. The project plan (USDA/SCS 1994) divides the project area into three Conservation Treatment Units (CTU's), with CTU 1 and 3 benefiting directly from the shoreline protection work implemented under Phase 1 of the project which was completed in 1995 ( Figure 1). Phase 2 of this CWPPRA project authorized the installation of eight box-type water control structures with a single flapgate, a variable-crest weir, and two fixed-crest weirs (one with a 4 inch vertical slot) in the project area. Three structures are located in CTU 1, three in CTU 2, and two in CTU 3 and they were completed in June of 1998. A number of water control structures were already in place prior to the project. Additional structures were installed by the landowner at the landowner's expense, to enhance the operation of the eight CWPPRA structures. The ME-04 project area has undergone many vegetation transitions since data collection in the area began in 1949 when the area was a nearly equal mix of brackish and intermediate vegetation. At the time of construction of the rock dike the project area had shifted to mostly fresh marsh with intermediate areas to the south and east. The southernmost unit, CTU 1, consisted of 13,800 ac (5,585 ha) of predominantly fresh marsh with zones of intermediate and brackish marsh along its eastern and southern boundaries. It was predominantly a Sagittaria lancifolia (bull tongue) and Spartina patens (wiregrass) marsh. Ponds ranged in depth from 1.7-2.0 ft (0.52 -0.61 m), and contain over 50% cover with aquatic plants (USDA/SCS 1994). The Phase 1 dike was designed to protect the eastern edge of CTU 1 from wave erosion and possible salt water intrusion from Freshwater Bayou Canal. CTU 2 consisted of 9,300 ac (3,764 ha) of fresh marsh, dominated by Echinochloa walteri (Walter's millet) and S. lancifolia, located in the west central portion of the project area. Pond depths ranged from 1.7-2.3 ft (0.52 -0.70 m). The northern section of the project area comprises CTU 3, which consisted of 13,800 ac (5,585 ha) of predominantly fresh marsh dominated by S. lancifolia, E. walteri, and Alternanthera philoxeroides (alligatorweed), with intermediate and brackish marsh zones dominated by Spartina patens and Schoenoplectus americanus (Chairmaker's bulrush) along its eastern boundary along Freshwater Bayou Canal. Pond depths ranged from 2.2-3.0 ft (0.67 -0.91 m) in CTU 3. Subsequently the project area has transitioned slowly to an almost completely intermediate marsh with some brackish locations to the south and east along Freshwater Bayou Canal. Reference areas R1 and R2 ( Figure 1) were established to monitor shoreline erosion along two 0.5 mi (0.8 km) segments of unprotected shoreline located along the east bank of Freshwater Bayou Canal, opposite the south end (R1) and the north end (R2) of the ME-04 rock dike. These two reference areas were used for comparison with erosion rates along the section of canal bank protected by the ME-04 rock dike within CTU 1. The vegetation type is identical to the project area, and like the project area shoreline, the reference area R1 and R2 shorelines include both intact and deteriorated sections of spoil bank. Reference area R3 is representative of what much of the fresh marsh in the northwest section of the project area resembled prior to 2005, in terms of soil type, salinity, water levels, and the frequency and duration of inundation. Reference area R4 is a small tidally influenced area of brackish marsh just outside the boundary of CTU 1. Marsh loss rates were monitored by comparison of all four reference areas with all three CTUs. Wetlands in the project area are adversely affected by the influence of high water levels from the Mermentau Lakes Sub basin to the west, where elevated water levels are artificially maintained by several locks and water control structures for navigation and agricultural purposes (LWCRTF 1993). Water flowing out of White Lake can enter the project area from the west via oil field canals, the borrow canals and culverts under LA Hwy 82, and from the north via natural openings along the south bank of Schooner Bayou. Some wetland acreage in the project area was lost through the dredging of oil field access canals and localized erosion. However, most wetland loss in the project area has resulted from hurricane degradation converting fresh and intermediate marsh to open water, mainly between 1956-1978 and 2004-2008. The land loss was not linier but punctuated by several extreme periods of land conversion to open water. The potential for tidal exchange between Vermilion Bay and the interior marshes in the project area has greatly increased since 1968 when the construction of Freshwater Bayou Canal was completed along with the numerous oil and gas exploration canals, the old GIWW, and the new GIWW. Initially, the fragile organic soils of the interior marshes were protected from saltwater intrusion and tidal scour by spoil banks along these channels. However, much of the spoil banks along Humble Canal and Freshwater Bayou Canal have been destroyed, largely by boat wake-induced shoreline erosion, exposing the interior wetlands to these detrimental forces. Based on data provided in a feasibility report by Brown and Root (1992), between 1968, an average of 34,051 large vessels (crew boats, jack-up barges, supply boats, and fishing boats) traveled through the Freshwater Bayou Canal lock and channel each year, contributing to an average shoreline erosion rate of 12.5 ft per year (3.8 m/yr) on each bank for this period. Hurricane Rita struck the coast of southwestern Louisiana on September 24, 2005 with maximum storm surge of 8-9 ft (2.4 -2.7 m) in the ME-04 project area (FEMA 2006). USGS calculated the amount of land that changed to water resulting from the storm to be 98 square miles in southwestern Louisiana, 62 square miles in the Mermentau basin (Barras 2006). This loss can be attributed to several patterns. Shearing, which is ripping and removal of marsh vegetation in historically healthy marshes was observed in marshes bordering the east bank of Freshwater Bayou. The removal of remnant marsh from areas with historical land loss from the surge was observed due east of Pecan Island, south of Sweet Lake, and due east of Deep Lake. A large area of open water also formed within CTU 1 ( Figure 2) during this storm event. Hurricane Ike struck near Galveston, Texas on September 13, 2008. A maximum storm surge of 7 -8 ft (2.1 -2.4 m) NAVD 88 was reported for the ME-04 project area (East et al. 2008). Hurricane Ike exacerbated the land loss in the ME-04 project area that begun during Hurricane Rita. The four year period from 2004-2008 approximately equaled the land loss experienced over the previous 50 years. However the destructive capacities of the 2005 and 2008 hurricanes were enhanced by the anthropogenic alterations to the landscape and weakened marsh habitat as previously discussed."}, {"section_title": "II.

Based on the surveys, NRCS and CPRA agreed to repair the deficient reaches of the foreshore rock dike to elevation 3. During the original construction of ME-04 in 1995, the rock dike in the area of the Transcontinental Pipeline was gapped and tied into the marsh. Marsh loss from Hurricane Rita caused marsh loss and increased the exchange behind the rock dike. The VPPJ obtained $360,000 from the Interim Emergency Board to address a 300 foot section of rock dike which was originally gapped. This project was completed in June 2014."}, {"section_title": "III.

Photography was obtained in 1997 (pre-construction) and in 2001 (postconstruction). The original photography was checked for flight accuracy, color correctness, and clarity and was subsequently archived. Aerial photography was scanned, mosaicked, and geo-rectified by USGS/NWRC personnel according to standard operating procedures (Steyer et al. 1995(Steyer et al. , revised 2000.

Salinity data is used to characterize the spatial variation in salinity throughout the project area, and to determine if project area salinity is being maintained within the target range. Salinity was monitored in 1996-1998 (pre-construction) and in 1999-2006 (postconstruction). The recorders were removed in September 2006 when CRMS monitoring began. Discrete monthly salinity and water depth were measured at 49 monitoring stations, including the seven recorder stations (Figure 1), 30 located inside the project area and 19 located outside the project area in reference areas R2 and R3, in exterior canals, and inside and outside of the eight CWPPRA structures). Staff gauge water level readings (in ft NAVD88) were also recorded monthly at the seven continuous recorder stations, inside and outside of the eight CWPPRA structures, and at the Vermilion Corporation boat house near the southeast corner of reference area R2. Salinity and water level were recorded by the USACE inside and outside of Schooner Bayou Lock. The discrete monthly salinity data were used to calculate a mean monthly salinity for the early growing season (March-June), the late growing season (July-October), and the dormant season (November-February) at each station, for the preconstruction (March 1996 through September 1998) and post-construction (October 1998 through December 2002) time periods. Discrete measurements were discontinued prior to 2003 and those data are included in previous reports. Salinity is currently being monitored hourly utilizing 4 CRMS-Wetlands stations (571, 580, 616, and 619) within the project area and selected reference sites (501,507,1130). Continuous data were used to characterize average annual salinities throughout the project and reference areas. At each servicing, a measurement of interstitial water salinity (porewater) is collected adjacent to each CRMS-Wetlands gauge. Interstitial water salinity is also collected at the vegetation plots when vegetation is surveyed.\nThe goal to reduce salinity levels to within the target range of less than 5 ppt for fresh to intermediate marsh vegetation was partially met, however since salinity trends in the project and reference areas were similar pre-and post-construction, this cannot be attributed to the project. Prior to construction, salinities within the project area were greater than 5ppt about 13% of the time, compared to around 8% within the reference area ( Figure 10). In years 1998In years , 2001In years , 2002In years , 2003In years , and 2004, salinities were outside of the target range less than 10% of the time in the both the project and reference areas. High salinities were prevalent within both project and reference areas in 1999 and 2000 due to drought conditions. In part of 2005 and all of 2006, the target range was exceeded more than 70% of the time. This is likely due to after effects of Hurricane Rita's storm surge and was reflected in both project and reference areas. The overall project area CRMS sites and the reference area CRMS sites in-target salinity averages were nearly identical between 2006-2013, 68.0% and 67.5% respectively. Both locations showed an increase in salinities in 2009 following Hurricane Ike, but the effects weren't as extreme as Hurricane Rita. During the 2010-2011 drought the reference sites were out of the salinity target more often that the project sites. The wet years of 2012 and 2013 reduced salinity in both locations but had a larger impact on the project sites and R3. The project sites were in the salinity target more often than the reference sites during this period (Figure 11). Discrete monthly water salinity readings taken at the eight CWPPRA structure sites do show that water salinity \"inside\" and \"outside\" of the structures was higher during the postconstruction period than during the pre-construction period at all eight structures (Mouledous 2011). Mean yearly interstitial porewater salinity at the CRMS project sites were the same as the CRMS reference sites. The project 10 cm salinities were lower than the reference 30 cm interstitial salinities across all years and outside the standard error range suggesting that the reference area soils are storing more salt than the project area annually (Figure 12). Generally interstitial salinities in the project and reference area tracked together and responded to stimuli similarly.

Six east-west transects were established uniformly across the project area. Sampling stations were established uniformly along each transect line to obtain an even distribution of sampling stations throughout the project area. Similar east-west transects were delineated across reference areas R2 and R3 to establish four sampling stations in each reference area. Percent cover, dominant plant heights, and species composition were documented in 2 m 2 sampling plots marked with 2 corner poles to allow for retreaded sampling over time.

Beginning in 2006 vegetation composition and cover was estimated from 10 permanent 2x2 m plots that are randomly distributed along a transect in the emergent marsh within each of the 1 km 2 CRMS-Wetlands sites.

Land to water analyses of the preconstruction imagery taken on 11 January 1997 indicate that over 80% of the project area, and reference area units R1, R2, and R3 were classified as land, while less than 45% of reference area R4 was classified as land.

On average the project shoreline has eroded -25.0 ft over the project's life while the reference shoreline has retreated over -117.4 ft and breached into numerous bayous, lakes, and ponds along the east bank of Freshwater Bayou. This has exposed the interior marshes of the reference area to increased wake, wave, and tidal forces. From construction in 1998 through 2014 the erosion rate in the reference area was nearly five times greater than the project area (project -1.6 ft/yr; reference -7.5 ft/yr) ( Table 3). The WVA estimated that shoreline losses would increase to -17.4 ft/yr in this area without action and during the 2005 to 2008 time period this rate was approached in the reference area (-15.0 ft/yr) (ME-04 WVA 1992). Several areas within the project rock dike have settled to below the designed elevation, which caused erosion rates to increase along the project shoreline near those locations. The rocks effectively protected the shoreline in the project area while the reference area continued to erode from 2008 to 2014 even as portions of the rock dike became compromised. As rocks settled and were breached from 2008 to 2011, the erosion rate tripled in the project area overall (-4.0 ft/yr) although the actual change was along the shoreline near the compromised locations (-5.2 ft/yr settled; -1.3 ft/yr stable). The most recent data collection effort in January, 2014 revealed continued erosion in the project area near the breaches (-1.3 ft/yr) although at a slower rate than from 2008 to 2011 and land gain along the rest of the project area (+0.6 ft/yr). The ME-04 rock dike has reduced shoreline erosion and protected interior marshes from wave and tidal forces along Freshwater Bayou even as it has settled in several areas.  Figure 7.

Water levels in the project area were within the target range less than 50% of the year during 10 years of project-specific data collection. However, project area water levels were within the target range a greater percentage of time than the reference area (Figure 8). In general, when reference area water levels were out of the target range, they tended to be greater than 2\" above the marsh surface. Project area water levels were less than 6\" below marsh surface more often than reference stations. This would be expected since the reference area stations are located along major waterways and are subject to higher tidal amplitude, while the three project area stations were located in interior marsh areas influenced by water control structures. Water levels were lower during all years in the project area compared to the reference area (Vincent 2003). But there were no distinct differences between the project and reference areas as differences between CTU's were as notable as project reference variations. This trend of no substantial differences between the project area and reference areas continued through 2013 as the project and reference CRMS sites were within the target range 45.5% and 50.1% respectively (Figure 9). The CRMS sites chosen as references had nearly identical intarget water levels to project area sites. Site 571 (in the northeastern part of CTU 2) had very high water levels compared to all other stations. It did appear that the reference water levels were general below target more often that the project area excluding CRMS 1130 which performed more similarly to the project area by being in target or flooded nearly the entire period of record (2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013). Thus there are no differences in the project or reference area hydrologic regimes as no extensive hydrologic separation is maintained."}, {"section_title": "Vegetation:", "text": "The ME-04 project area has undergone consistent vegetation transitions since data collection in the area began in 1949 when the area was a nearly equal mix of brackish and intermediate vegetation (Table 4). The project area was dominated by fresh vegetation just prior to construction of the project however the following decade brought drought and hurricane forces to the region. The project was completed in 1998 which coincided with an extended multiyear drought in the region and the vegetative cover dropped slightly in 1998 and 2001 respectively from the pre project levels of 1996 ( Figure 13). Following Hurricane Rita in 2005, cover plummeted in all units, though only slightly in R4 (R2 and R3 weren't sampled in 2005). Slowly the marsh vegetation recovered during 2006 and 2007 but again was inhibited following Hurricane Ike in 2008 but to a much less extent than Hurricane Rita. The project specific sampling data ended post Hurricane Ike but the CRMS sites in the area suggested a slow steady improvement in most units until the 2010-2011 time frame. These effects were generally ubiquitous across the area and not related to the project features. The project and reference area CRMS sites showed a recovery from Hurricane Rita with increases in cover and FQI scores through 2008 at all locations except for CTU 1, which had a negative trend (Figure 14). Through 2010, all units showed a recovery to near pre-Hurricane Rita levels except for CTU 1 which continued to decrease in cover and FQI score over this time. CTU 1 did make a rapid recovery in 2011 possibly due to the large drought as most of the project and reference locations initially responded favorably to the lower water levels. In general the CRMS project sites vegetation reached a peak in 2011-2012 and dropped off in percent cover and FQI value in 2013. The reference area CRMS sites trended differently except for R2 which was very similar to the project. Reference areas one and three both showed percent cover and FQI loss in the wetter 2012 but recovery in 2013. Overall the project and reference area's vegetation is very similar, dominated by Spartina patens and responding to stimuli accordingly. However R3 is distinct in the vegetation species present and marsh salinity type, it is a substantially less saline environment rarely exceeding the project target of 5 ppt and this is reflected in the herbaceous community composition ( Figure  15). After 2008 some of the project and reference areas started to trend toward a more brackish and saline vegetation cohort but most of the locations stabilized or reverted back to pre-2008 vegetation salinity patterns during the heavy rain falls of 2012.

The bulk density profile of 507 had a substantially higher bulk density and lower percent organic matter below 16 cm than any other location suggesting it could be located near a ridge or cheniere. While CRMS 571 possessed the lowest bulk density and highest percent organic matter signifying a very peaty soil.

The project locations are mostly maintaining elevation compared to the Sabine Pass NOAA tide gauge sea level rise estimate of 0.6 centimeters per year except CRMS 616 (Zervas 2009). Overall this is probably not a direct result from the project features though the rock dike along Freshwater Bayou Canal reduces the tidal export of sediments and organic materials from CTU one. This indicates that land loss in the project area would likely to be dominated by wave erosion which the project rock dike effectively reduces. The elevation change rates of the project area ranged from 1.32 cm/yr to 0.05 cm/yr relative to SLR, but generally were closer to 0.6 cm/yr on average. The elevation change rates of the reference CRMS sites ranged from 0.43cm/yr to -1.28 cm/yr compared to SLR, but averaged approximately -0.2 cm/yr. These values indicate elevation change rates along Freshwater Bayou are generally stable. CRMS site 1130 had the largest negative elevation change rate (-1.28 cm/yr). This is likely due to its isolation from any sediment source, herbivory and high subsidence. Figure 18. Elevation change per year comparative to sea level rise as experienced in the project CRMS sites and reference CRMS sites. The overall trend is that the project sites are keeping up with SLR while the reference sites are varied in nature."}, {"section_title": "34", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "V. Conclusions", "text": "a."}, {"section_title": "Project Effectiveness", "text": "The shoreline along the west bank of Freshwater Bayou Canal and associated wetlands in the project area have benefited from the construction of the project rock dike, as indicated by the significantly reduced erosion rates relative to the reference areas. However, the rate of erosion increases when the elevation of the rock dike falls below the original construction elevation, as noted between the 2008-2011 and 2011-2014 time intervals. Maintenance events in 2002 and 2005 lifted the rock dike back to the prescribed elevations; however a large breach had occurred at the Transco Pipeline exposing the interior marsh of CTU 1 to the tidal effects of Vermilion Bay. CTU 1 was already severely impacted by Hurricanes Rita and Ike and is the most vulnerable area of the project to tidal scour and sediment export. A maintenance event by the Vermilion Parish Police Jury has been completed to plug the 300 foot breach at the Transco Pipeline. In addition, a CWPPRA O&M maintenance event to address the deficient reaches of foreshore rock dike is expected to begin in 2014/2015. In an effort to reduce costs, the Engineering, Design and Construction Contract for ME-04 Freshwater Bayou Wetland Protection Project will be combined with the maintenance proposed for ME-13 Freshwater Bayou Canal Bank Stabilization Project. The ME-04 project is not effectively keeping water levels within the desired range since the project and reference areas are in target nearly an identical percentage of the year (45-50%). Salinity stayed within the target range in the project area and reference area over 62% of the year since 2007, but this cannot be attributed to project features because there is no significant hydrologic separation between the project and reference areas. The observed salinity spikes have been associated with periods of droughts and tropical storm or hurricane activity in the project and reference locations. Reference area 10cm and 30cm porewater salinities were higher than their project area counterparts consistently across all years surveyed, suggesting that the rock dike may prevent higher saline waters penetrate the project area. Marsh loss in the project area and specifically CTU 1 continues to be a major issue but is typically associated with episodic hurricane damage in the interior marshes. Without the project rock dike it is likely that Freshwater Bayou Canal would have breached into multiple areas of the ME-04 project wetlands and created deep water interior connections between the Freshwater Bayou Canal and CTU 1. This separation of Freshwater Bayou Canal and the interior wetlands prevents strong tidal scouring that would remove fragile organic soils from the project area. Vegetation in the project area was severely impacted by Hurricane Rita and to a lesser extent by Hurricane Ike. Species assemblages have generally rebounded to pre disturbance percent cover and FQI values. The vegetation showed a small but consistent increase in brackish and saline species from 2008 to 2011 when high rainfall in 2012 and 2013 reversed that trend. A 35 large blowout in CTU 1, caused by Hurricane Rita, in combination with the tidal exchange through the breach in the spoil bank levee is causing stress to the vegetation and erosion of that unit. Overall there is very little distinct separation between the vegetation in the project and reference areas except for R 3 which is hydrologically isolated from the salinity pulses present to the east."}, {"section_title": "b. Recommended Improvements", "text": "Overall the Freshwater Bayou Wetlands Project rock dike is in operational condition; however the portions of the foreshore dike that have settled below the designed elevation need to be capped to prevent further bankline erosion. A funding request was approved by the CWPPRA taskforce in 2012 and construction is likely to begin in the 2014-2015 timeframe."}, {"section_title": "c. Lessons Learned", "text": "The water control structures that were constructed, operated and maintained by the land owner are not included in the CPRA Operation and Maintenance Plan. Implementation of CWPPRA projects where the landowner has total control over the operation of existing water control structures, and over the installation and operation of additional structures as part of the features of a CWPPRA project, as was the case for ME-04, has been discontinued. In order to prevent further wetland degradation along Freshwater Bayou, especially in the ME-04 project and reference areas and adjacent marshes, and to prevent increased saltwater intrusion into this part of the Chicot Aquifer, any deepening and widening of the Freshwater Bayou Canal to Port of Iberia Canal shipping lane must be mitigated by the installation and maintenance of canal embankments, preferably armored with rock or protected by rock dikes. The proposed deepening and widening of Freshwater Bayou, Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, and Port of Iberia Canal on the ME-04 project and reference areas and adjacent marsh areas would introduce additional saltwater into fresh and intermediate marshes. This cross sectional increase would also exacerbate the tidal forces ability to remove organic materials and soils from the interior wetlands. Most of the marshes in the ME-04 project and reference areas have converted from mainly fresh marshes to intermediate to brackish dominated by Spartina patens. These intermediate and brackish marshes are inundated a considerable proportion of the year and if this is exacerbated due to increasing the size of Freshwater Bayou or due to rapid sea level rise the current dominant species Spartina patens could undergo rapid die back. It is more likely that these marshes will convert to a less productive shallow pond habitat than to an emergent or floating vegetation type (LCWCRTF, 2002). The Cameron-Creole Wetlands and Sabine National Wildlife Refuge Freshwater Impoundment (Unit 5) are historically similar in soils and marsh types to those in the Freshwater Bayou project and reference areas. Navigation channel-induced saltwater intrusion due to widening and deepening of the Calcasieu Ship Channel in the 1950's caused major land loss by killing vegetation in the fresh sawgrass marsh and converting it to shallow open water ponds (LCWCRTF, 2002 TOTAL OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE BUDGET:"}]
