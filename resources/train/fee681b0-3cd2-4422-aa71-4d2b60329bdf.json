In addition to respiratory effects, COVID-19 has negative cardiovascular effects as well [4, 5] . COVID-19 has placed tremendous pressures on health care organizations around the world.\nCVDs are among the most prevalent non-communicable diseases worldwide [6] . Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is recommended as the standard of care for secondary prevention of CVD [7, 8] as it significantly reduces morbidity and mortality [9] . Although models vary, CR is generally delivered in clinical settings [10] , involving semi-weekly visits for exercise and education/counselling sessions over several months, for a median of 24 sessions globally [11] .\nThese in-person visits therefore, if continued during COVID-19, carry a high risk of exposure."}, {"section_title": "Design and Procedure", "text": "This research was cross-sectional in design. This work was undertaken by the International Council of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation (ICCPR; globalcardiacrehab.com); York University's Office of Research Ethics (Toronto, Canada) approved secondary use of the data for publication purposes. Participation in the survey constituted voluntary consent to participate. Responses were confidential.\nAll 40 ICCPR member associations and 10 \"friend\" members were contacted, and requested to circulate the survey to their members and any other programs of which they were aware in their regions. Contacts of the investigators were also approached to circulate and complete the survey. Potential respondents were also recruited from the attendance list of the ICCPR webinar on COVID-19 and CR [26] , which was attended by more than 300 participants.\nData collection occurred from March to June 2020 via online survey administered through REDCap (English). The original survey was not available within China. Therefore, the survey was translated (Simplified Chinese) by co-author XL, a bilingual nurse with CR expertise, and disseminated through Sojump, a professional online survey platform.\nin the global audit only a random subsample of programs was recruited in the United States, but all programs were emailed for this study) [28] .

Non-COVID-related questionnaire items were based on ICCPR's previous CR program survey [18] . The questionnaire was divided into three sections:\n(1) CR program characteristics and impacts of COVID-19, (2) barriers and facilitators to delivering CR programs virtually, and (3) COVID-related impacts on staff and patients. The items had forced-choice (some were select all that apply) and open-ended response options, and skip-logic was used to get more detail where applicable. Input from CR providers was solicited, with minor changes made to questions and wording prior to launch of the survey.\nRespondents were asked to report their country and the date. To contextualize responses, information on COVID-19 cases at the time of survey completion in each country was extracted from the website \"Our World in Data\" [29] and confirmed with data available on each country's government website. The Government Response Stringency Index -information on 9 common policy responses that governments have taken to respond to the pandemic such as workplace closures and stay-at-home requirements (rescaled to a value from 0 to 100, with 100 = strictest responses) -was also extracted from this website for each country, with information corresponding to the mean date of survey completion by respondents in each country. number of responses for each question varied due to missing data (e.g., respondent did not answer a question due to inapplicability, skip logic, or decided to not answer for other reasons); for descriptive analyses, percentages were computed using the number of valid responses for the specific item as the denominator.\nDescriptive statistics (e.g., frequency with percentage) were applied for all closed-ended items in the survey.

The most common program adaptations were: reducing the number of program elements offered (n=228, 19.5%), deferring graduation until post-program assessments could be completed (n=120; 10.3%), shortening the program duration (n=95, 8.2%), and graduating patients more quickly (n=85, 7.3%). On the other hand, 177 (15.1%) respondents reported adapting all program elements to retain service levels (see Table 2 for adaptations by WHO region). Table 3 displays the components that are delivered by CR programs, and continue to be provided during the COVID-19 pandemic. As shown, most impacted was supervised exercise training, resistance training, inclusion of family / informal caregivers, end of program reassessment, and functional capacity testing. Indeed, of the programs providing services or without COVID-19 restrictions, 119 (14.5%) had changed the type of functional capacity test they use. Of these, 30 (26.3%) were performing functional capacity testing remotely, most commonly: a walk test (n=19; 1.6%), step test (n=6; 0.5%); 15 (1.3%) cited other tests, such as the Duke Activity Status Index and timed sit-to-stand.\nOf those that continued providing services, the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted the way exercise is prescribed for 306 (37.5%) programs (e.g., virtual consultations with no structured supervised exercise program), and monitored for 226 (27.8%; e.g., focus on rating of perceived exertion rather than target heart rate, all done virtually).

As shown, there was a drastic reduction in exposure to all disciplines. Modes of delivery were chiefly phone, email, online resources, and mail; live video was only exploited in approximately 20% of programs. For those that offered it, education session frequency before COVID-19 was 8.7\u00b18.4 / month / patient (mean of 50.1\u00b147.5 minutes / session), dropping to 4.1\u00b17.5 (mean of 20.2\u00b126.0 minutes / session) during the pandemic."}, {"section_title": "Alternative / Remote Delivery of CR due to COVID-19", "text": "Reimbursement and delivery of alternative models (e.g., home-based) is shown in Table   4 , including the proportion of patients served (shown before COVID by country elsewhere). 30 Of those delivering alternative models, 226 (31.7%) programs offered low-tech home-based (e.g., landlines, mail only), 175 (24.5%) offered high-tech home-based, 83 (11.7%) some hybrid format with supervised and unsupervised sessions, 74 (10.4%) offered community-based, and 6 (0.9%) offered \"other\" models (e.g., livestream).\nForms of communication used in remote models are also shown in Table 4 . Overall, 182 (62.8%) programs reported barriers to using these communication tools, most commonly: lack of patient access (i.e., patients not having computer with email; n=146, 12.5%), difficulties for the patients (e.g., lack of technical knowledge; n=111, 9.6%), logistical problems such as connectivity issues (n=107, 9.2%), and difficulties for the clinical staff (e.g., being too busy, lack of staff; n=53, 4.6%).\nBarriers to delivering CR remotely were: patients did not have the technology to connect with program staff remotely (n=195, 16.8%), lack of equipment /program resources for secure and private remote delivery (n=148, 12.7%), insufficient funding (n=123, 10.5%), insufficient staff (n=118, 10.1%), patients' risk is too high for unsupervised exercise/safety concerns (n=111, 9.5%), too inefficient (i.e., cannot see as many patients because they do not offer remote program elements in a group, but only individually; n=90, 7.7%), staff need training (n=90, 7.7%), and no policy (n=69, 5.9%); other barriers (n=24, 2.1%) included language proficiency, remote delivery not reimbursed, not enough referrals and hours.\nFinally, to increase their capacity to deliver home-based/remote CR services to patients (open-ended item), respondents perceived they would need: time to research and develop the model (including appropriate services for illiterate patients); secure /private means for staff to communicate with patients electronically; equipment to communicate remotely with patients (e.g., multiple laptops with built-in cameras and microphones, headsets); facilities / space (e.g., videoconferencing in private room); home equipment to loan patients including tablets, wearables/activity trackers for exercise monitoring and assessment of all risk factors (e.g., sphygmomanometers/cuffs); cheap and reliable wireless technology to monitor for adverse events remotely (e.g., heart rate and rhythm); reliable and low-cost high-speed internet access for staff and patients (including those living in rural and remote areas); a dedicated multidisciplinary team (including more nurses and exercise physiologists); staff training (by those with experience in remote models), physician champions; administrative staff to facilitate scheduling of virtual sessions; a structured, evidence-based home-based CR program software platform or smartphone All rights reserved.

Given that three-quarters of responding programs reported complete or temporary cessation of services, we estimate COVID-19 has been responsible for the closure of approximately 4400 CR programs worldwide; it is unknown when or if these programs will resume care delivery. Capacity was incredibly low in the programs that remained open (i.e., 3 patients/month, with no new patients) and key risk-reducing components were no longer delivered in more than 60% of on-going programs, including supervised exercise training.

Although about a fifth of respondents in this study reported they have been coping \"alright\" with COVID-19, many are experiencing anxiety, fear of exposing family, loneliness, difficulty sleeping, and stress due to higher workloads (including answering many questions from patients about their concerns). Over a third felt the need to work despite perceived risk, due to fear of losing their job or pay (and one in five had no sick pay).\nApproximately a third of CR program respondents had been redeployed, rendering it impossible to deliver CR services without staff.

First, this was a convenience sample; results may be biased, representing mainly programs that still had some staff working and available to respond to the survey. However, there was good representation from programs in community and academic hospitals alike. We did assume that each response was received from a unique program, however it is possible different staff members from the same program completed a survey, given most respondents were working remotely. Response rate was lower in the Americas and Europe, so generalizability to those regions is more questionable; country representation was high, however. Second, the reliability and validity of the survey is unknown; it was pilot-tested, but responses in a random subsample of programs were not verified against actual delivery. Programs may have responded in a socially-desirable manner, although the survey was confidential. Third, because of small cell sizes in some case, inferential comparisons by WHO region could not be performed.
