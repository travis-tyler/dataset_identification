This program is designed to improve Title V programs by strengthening activities for at-risk communities. Through Home Visiting, trained visitors meet with at-risk families at home to evaluate circumstances and connect families to services beneficial to child health, development, and ability to learn. Outcome measures are categorized into 6 benchmark domains. The Iowa MIECHV targets at-risk families in 18 high-need counties in Iowa (see list below). The program aims to improve outcomes for families from the prenatal period through the child's start of school. This report provides population-based baseline data corresponding to 5 of the 6 benchmark outcome domains in Iowa's MIECHV plan, and focuses on health and well-being of children ages 0 -5 years in these target counties ( Figure 1 ): (See appendix 2 for a complete listing of benchmark outcomes)"}, {"section_title": "Specific MIECHV benchmark domains include:", "text": "The 18 high-need Iowa counties targeted by MIECHV are: The primary goals of the 2010 IHHS were to: 1) assess the health and well-being of children and families in Iowa, 2) assess a set of early childhood issues, 3) evaluate the health insurance coverage of children in Iowa and features of the uninsured, and 4) assess the health and well-being of racial and ethnic minority children in Iowa. Questions in the 2010 survey included a wide range of topic areas encompassing the health, overall well-being, and family environment of children in Iowa with a special emphasis on early childhood issues.

The survey was conducted with parents of children in Iowa using an address-based sampling design. Data collection was completed using a combination of telephone and Internet survey methods. The University of Northern Iowa Center for Social and Behavioral Research coordinated the data collection efforts.\nFor the survey process: 1) A packet was mailed to a statewide random sample of addresses drawn from the United States Postal Service (USPS) Delivery Sequence File (DSF). The packet included an information letter with instructions for completing a web-based questionnaire; 2) The USPS DSF included telephone numbers for about 60% of addresses. Non-respondents for whom a phone number was available were called if they did not complete the web survey within the first week.\nDuring the core data collection period, 2,386 participated: 1,859 phone and 527 online interviews took place with the parent or guardian of one randomly selected child age 0-17 years living in the household. The data were weighted to account for family size and post-stratified to reflect the 2010 child population in Iowa. As the 2010 Census had just been completed at the time of the 2010 Iowa Household Health Survey, a relatively precise count of children in Iowa was obtained. This was used to determine if the characteristics of the population who completed the survey varied significantly from the total population as identified in the census data.\nOver 2300 families with children in Iowa were surveyed through telephonebased and online surveys\nA weight related to the design effect was added to the analysis in order to make statistical testing more accurate. Weights for individual cases range from .28 to 3.84, with a mean weight of .7629.\nRespondents were primarily mothers (78%), although 16% were fathers. The remaining 6% were other types of guardians, primarily relatives of the child. There were almost equal numbers of boys (51%) and girls (49%) represented in the sample.\nFor this report, data were used only for children ages 0-5. The total number of families with young children for these analyses was 660. In the Home Visiting Intervention counties, there were 166 respondents with children ages 0-5; the rest of the state was represented by 494 children. On some items, we were able to look at differences by urban-rural status using USDA Urban-Rural Continuum codes. 2 We looked at results comparing rural/mostly rural counties in MIECHV counties vs. rural/mostly rural counties in the rest of the state, and Urban/mostly urban MIECHV counties vs. urban/mostly urban counties in the rest of the state. Appendix 3 shows the breakdown of counties and the number of respondents from each category. For the most part, our numbers were not large enough to show significant differences, but we have highlighted a few areas where differences did occur.

The MIECHV program seeks to serve some of the most vulnerable families in these counties.\nOver 80% of children in MIECHV counties had a medical home, comparable to the rest of the state\nOverall, children ages 0 -5 years in Iowa are very healthy and likely to have health insurance, and the counties in the MIECHV are no exception. However young children living in MIECHV counties have less positive outcomes than the rest of the state in a few key areas. For example, the prevalence and length of time breastfeeding is an area that could be improved upon, and will be directly addressed by the MIECHV.\nChildren in MIECHV counties were more likely to live in a household where smoking was reported to be a problem. Children were more likely to live in low-income households, and to have a parent who did not complete high school. MIECHV interventions that focus on family issues such as poverty, smoking, and educational attainment have the potential to provide a healthier environment for children in MIECHV counties.\n`Another area of concern is a higher rate of Children with Special Health Care Needs in the MIECHV counties. The MIECHV program can address this by making sure children and their families have adequate access to services and support. One positive factor in this direction is that children are more likely in MIECHV counties to have health care coverage. The primary difference appears to be higher enrollment in Medicaid and hawk-i.\nThe MIECHV program in Iowa has the potential to assist families in a number of key areas that will affect the health and well-being of children in Iowa. The program is wellpositioned to help families in some of the most vulnerable areas of the state to improve outcomes for children who may be at-risk for health and developmental issues."}]
