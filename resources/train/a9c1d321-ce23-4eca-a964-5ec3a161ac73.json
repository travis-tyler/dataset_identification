Methods: Participants with brain imaging at ages 69 and 73 years were identified from a previous study. Simple manual measures and computationally automated volumetry were performed. Receiver operating characteristics assessed the predictive ability of each method at baseline and on logit regression analysis of two serial scans. Results: Ten of 149 participants developed Alzheimer's dementia and had lower baseline volumes (3647 vs. 4194 mm 3 P 5 .002), rates of volume loss (2126 vs. 236 mm 3 /y; P 5 .001), and rates of loss in hippocampal fraction (28.55 vs. 22.35 x 10 25 /y; P 5 .001). Baseline volume with a rate of change gave the highest area under the curve value of 0.96. Discussion: Automated volumetry measuring hippocampal size at age 69 years and subsequent rate of change predicts Alzheimer's dementia development."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Hippocampal size can be assessed in a variety of ways, with differing amounts of manual operator input and processing time. Previously described methods include visual assessment [1, 2] , linear measurements [1, 3] , manual volumetry [3] , automated volumetry [2] , and signal intensity based scoring [4] . We are interested in methods that could be incorporated into routine clinical practice, including automated methods.\nIn 1992, Scheltens et al [1] published their semiquantitative visual rating score for hippocampal atrophy. This initial publication showed correlations between a five-point visual scale, linear measurements, age, and the presence or absence of Alzheimer's dementia (AD). Over the next 20 years, Scheltens' score has been correlated with neuropsychology rating scales, pathological scoring, and future progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to clinical AD [5] .\nIn 2007 and 2012, Adachi et al [3, 6] published ratios of hippocampal height and width to calculate a rounding ratio (RR) in subjects with and without AD. The RR correlated with manually outlined hippocampal volumes (Spearman's r 5 0.42), AD and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Hippocampi had a reduced width with increasing RR, changing the coronal cross section from elongated to rounded. This measure has received little attention in the literature and requires validation.\nFreeSurfer is established open-source software for automated brain segmentation and readily produces volume measurements [7] .\nThe individuals in our study are from a large, wellcharacterized population-based cohort who were normal at recruitment and followed up with two brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans 4 years apart and with AD outcomes recorded. This sample provides unique opportunities to define imaging thresholds for the risk of developing dementia in the general population, including in people who are not yet symptomatic. In this study, we will compare measurement techniques and find if adding a second scan improves our ability to predict who is developing AD. We are using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) to compare the techniques [8] . Values of AUC range from 1.00 which is a perfect test down to 0.50 which represents no discriminating ability. AUC values of 0.80 to 0.90 are regarded as good and 0.90 to 1.00 as excellent. We will present the risk of AD graphically as a continuum with baseline size and rate of change as contributing factors."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "A subset of the Aberdeen Birth Cohort 1936 (ABC36) who had undergone two MRI scans was identified. ABC36 participants were recruited from participants of the Scottish Mental Health Survey of 1947, which was conducted by the Scottish Council for Research and Education (SCRE). All participants were born in 1936, and almost all (N 5 75,211) schoolchildren in Scotland were studied.\nThe SCRE allowed the University of Aberdeen to have access to these data. A total of 2620 of the schoolchildren had been tested in Aberdeen City. Nine hundred thirtyfour participants were found to be alive and living in Aberdeen using the Community Health Index and other identifiers. Six hundred sixty-four had Community Health Index numbers and were approached via their primary care physicians. The local Family Doctors' Research Committee requested that each prospective participant's family physician should sign a written invitation letter and that those who were recently bereaved or those with a life-threatening illness should be excluded. The family doctors were asked to invite potential participants if they were not known to have dementia and were living independently in the community. Of 647 individuals who were eligible, 506 agreed to take part in a followup study of brain aging and health and 498 provided a minimum data set of consent, clinical history, vital signs, MMSE, and Raven's Progressive Matrices. These 498 participants were recruited between 1999 and 2003. Written informed consent as approved by the Local Research Ethics Committee was obtained by a trained research nurse for assessment, follow-up, inspection of medical records, and sharing of materials with noncommercial collaborators. Participants with an MMSE of less than 24 on initial screening were excluded.\nBeginning in 2004, a target number of 250 participants were selected for an MRI study. The database was first scrutinized to remove those with known contraindications to MRI and/or who were in treatment for serious illness. Participants were invited sequentially in the order in which they had entered the study earlier.\nTwo hundred forty-nine participants agreed and were scanned at an age of approximately 69 years. By the age of about 73 years, there had been an attrition of 67 participants and 166 of the remainder agreed to a repeat MRI.\nThe details of the cohort are available from Whalley et al [9] ."}, {"section_title": "Imaging protocol", "text": "For consistent, directly comparable imaging acquisitions, all participants at all time points were scanned in the same 1.5-T Genesis Signa NVi MRI scanner (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI, USA).

The rater was blinded to the cognitive function scores and dementia outcomes.\nThe rater manually realigned coronal oblique images from the volumetric T1 series using a commercially available viewer. First, left-right rotational realignment was performed along the head-foot axis. A sagittal plane was positioned to demonstrate one of the hippocampi. The sloping anteroposterior axis of the hippocampus was noted on this sagittal image, and a coronal plane was angled perpendicular to this. Images showing the realignment process are available in the Supplementary Fig. 1 .\nFor manual hippocampal rounding, the realigned coronal plane was positioned at the body of the hippocampus in an area without superior digitations and where hippocampal detail was best visualized. Hippocampal width was taken from the hippocampal sulcus medially to the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle (as in Adachi et al [6] ). Hippocampal height was measured at w90 to this. For consistency, all hippocampal height measurements included the alveus because the alveus was inconsistently discernible as a discrete structure. Hippocampal height measurements included the gray matter of the subiculum. A sample of 20 double-read scans gave intra-class correlation coeffecients (ICCs) of 0.78 for linear measurements and 0.07 for RR. For each scan, the RR was expressed as the mean of both sides' heightOwidth. An example measurement is shown in Fig. 1 .\nScheltens' hippocampal atrophy score [1] was performed on a single, angled coronal section where the pons, trigeminal nerves, and third ventricle were visible. The interobserver variability of Scheltens' score is known from previous studies to have a k value of 0.44 to 0.51 [10] ."}, {"section_title": "Automated measurements", "text": "The volumetric analysis was performed using the Free-Surfer software package (version 4.5.0) (http://surfer.nmr. mgh.harvard.edu/). The brain imaging preprocessing steps include motion correction, affine transformation to Talairach image space, nonuniform intensity normalization for intensity inhomogeneity correction, and removal of nonbrain tissues [11] [12] [13] .\nThe hippocampus is among a number of subcortical structures segmented to obtain their volume. The segmentation is based on the voxel's location in the volume, the neighboring voxels' tissue classes, and the intensity value in each voxel. This automatic labeling procedure is comparable in accuracy to manual labeling [14] assuring the quality of the procedure. In addition, the obtained results are reliable when comparing the current method with several different automatic segmentation procedures [15] . The ICC for this method applied to the hippocampus is known to be 0.96 to 0.98 [16] .\nThe data follow the longitudinal stream processing creating an unbiased template from both time points for each subject and subsequently extracting the volumes from each time point [16] .\nLeft and right hippocampal volumes (mm 3 ) were extracted, and the average of left and right hippocampal volumes are reported in this study.

This is shown by its ROC AUC of 0.84 (good) compared with 0.67 (poor) for Scheltens' scale and 0.52 (fail) for RR.\nThe ability of a hippocampal size measurement to predict AD is improved by combining a baseline measurement with a rate of change. This is significant for Scheltens' scale and for automated volumetry. Therefore, in cases of diagnostic uncertainty, the waiting time and expense of a second MRI scan may add value for diagnosis.\nAverage hippocampal volume in mm 3 combined with a rate of change in mm 3 /y gives the highest ROC AUC of 0.96 (excellent). The predicted AD risk derived from these two factors is shown graphically in Fig. 3 .\nRR performs poorly for predicting AD development. This is in contrast to Scheltens' scores which were performed by the same observer, and which correlated strongly with automated volumetry. Early disease, a limited coronal resolution of 1.6 mm, measurement variability, and a limited number of AD outcomes in a normally aging cohort are possible explanations for RR's poor performance.\nPrior studies have shown that the annual hippocampal atrophy rate is greater in patients with known AD compared with healthy controls, for example, 2.7% versus 0.8% in Hua et al [21] , 5.59% versus 0.66% in Morra et al 2009 [22] , 1.5% versus 0.6% in Sluimer et al [23] , and 4.66% versus 1.41% in Barnes et al [24] meta-analysis of prior studies. Our rates of hippocampal volume loss were 3.42% in participants who are developing AD and 0.85% in participants who did not develop AD.\nIn 2007, Ridha et al [4] compared different manual measures of hippocampal atrophy in 47 patients with clinically probable AD and in 26 controls aged approximately 65 years. Participants were scanned twice, at an interval of 481 6 302 days (personal communication). Using manual tracing, volume atrophy rates were higher at 4.49% per year in AD compared with 0.37% per year in controls (P .001). Scheltens' scores in the study by Ridha et al deteriorated by 0.15 units/y in AD and, opposite to expected, deteriorated even more quickly in controls at 0.20 units/y although this was not significant. In our study, Scheltens' scores deteriorated faster in AD at 0.09 compared with 0.01 units/y. Ridha et al [4] have also performed ROC analysis. The AUC for volume atrophy rate was better than for Scheltens' scale and for a novel measure of regional signal intensity. The AUC numerical values were not reported, in contrast to our study.\nLongitudinal follow-up studies of participants without clinical dementia are limited. Jack et al [25] assessed 91 normal elderly subjects at baseline and 1.4 years later, of whom two developed AD. In contrast to our study, hippocampal annual percentage change was not significantly associated with conversion in the normal participants.\nHenneman et al [26] studied the added value of atrophy rates to baseline volume in identifying AD. In a group comprising 44 participants with MCI, 26 patients with subjective complaints, and 8 healthy volunteers, those with low hippocampal volume at baseline and a high hippocampal atrophy rate had a hazard ratio of 61.1 for developing AD. Our study confirms that adding atrophy rate to baseline volume improves prediction, as shown by improved ROC values, in a larger group without dementia at baseline. Our study remains novel in that we worked from a large, well-characterized initially normal cohort, had longitudinal imaging over 4 years, had clinical follow-up 11 years after the first MRI, and directly compared manual to automated methods of image analysis. We have used ROC to assess predictive ability and reported AUCs. We have combined the predictive power of baseline and follow-up hippocampal volumes and produced graphical plots to easily visualize the risk of a person developing AD.\nOur study has limitations. It may not be generalizable outside our selected population, and therefore, the model would benefit from validation in other cohorts. We have used clinical diagnoses of AD rather than postmortem neuropathologic diagnoses, and there is known to be a mismatch rate between these [27] . This is a limitation of all clinical studies that do not have postmortem pathology available. The correlation between hippocampal size and the neuropathologic severity of AD is imperfect [28, 29] , especially if outlier points are included [30] .\nWe chose the subset of participants who returned for a second MRI scan at age 73 years, excluding those for whom a follow-up MRI was unavailable. Many individuals were diagnosed with AD between the first and second MRI scans. In the clinical scenario, it would be advantageous to know the rate of change in hippocampal size before 4 years have elapsed.\nOur axial plane of volumetric image acquisition would have maximized measurement uncertainty in the vertical direction. More modern scanners have better spatial resolution for volumetric images, and this would improve the quality of multiplanar reconstructions (e.g., the ADNI criteria, which were published after our data collection, require ,1.5 mm slice thickness compared with our 1.6 mm [31] , and direct angled coronal acquisitions as used by Adachi et al [6] are optimal for manual measurements). In our study, the comparison of different measurement methods against each other remains valid, and the comparison of rates of change over time using consistent image quality is valid. It remains clear that Scheltens' scale is superior to RR and that volumetric analysis is superior to manual measurements for the detection of AD. Because volumetric series are acquired routinely in clinical settings, it is feasible to incorporate automated volumetry into routine clinical practice. We envisage that with continuing increases in everyday computing power, automated volumetry will become a useful adjunct in the clinical setting."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "A combination of baseline hippocampal volume and subsequent rate of change in hippocampal volume is a good predictor of older people who are developing AD. given to the participants from the Aberdeen 1936 Birth Cohort studies for their voluntary contribution to these projects.
