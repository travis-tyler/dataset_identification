Parental involvement is also an important factor in student success in school. In this paper, public schools Kindergartners students were researched using the National Center for Education Statistics Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (Kindergarten class of 1998(Kindergarten class of -1999. The purpose was to study differences in student learning on reading and mathematics related to levels of parental volunteerism in Kindergarten, after controlling for initial differences in testing scores at the beginning of the school year. For the aforementioned reasons, states are finding it more important that children from lower income backgrounds have access to quality early childhood education (Dwyer, Chait, & McKee, 2000). Participation in an early childhood education program can provide preschoolers with skills and enrichment that can increase their chances of success in school (U.S. Department of Education 2001). Many studies show that family environment is an important factor in the cognitive development of children (McGillicuddy-DeLisi, 1982). A child is more likely to identify with a warm, affectionate parent and thus imitate and obey the adult (MacPhee, et al, 1984). Students living in nontraditional families are significantly less likely to have parents who participated in at least 3 of 4 activities than students living in traditional families (U.S. Department of Education, 2000). Stepparents tend to be less involved than biological parents in their children's schools, but their involvement can be associated with better outcomes for students. In general, the association between the school involvement of stepparents and student outcomes is the same as biological parents in a traditional family. Single mothers and fathers are involved in their children's schools and their involvement is associated with better school outcomes for their children. Nonresident mothers are more likely than nonresident fathers to maintain contact with their children and to be involved in their children's schools. The association between their involvement and students' outcomes is weaker than that of nonresident fathers' involvement. According to this report, about 50% of the risk associated with single mother family structure is due to lower family income of single mothers. Parents who participate with their children in socially stimulating and intellectually stimulating interaction have children with relatively greater intellectual competence (MacPhee, et al, 1984). Children of single mothers are at higher risk than those from two-parent families for dropping out of high school and early pregnancy (Huston, 1997). Positive developmental outcomes are facilitated and nurtured by qualities in the mother-child relationship that create learning opportunities for children in their environment (Matzicopoulos, 1997). The research that follows is based on some of the information provided above regarding the importance of parental involvement, early childhood and Kindergarten education. Combining the two issues, secondary data was used to determine if children in Kindergarten public school programs perform better when parents volunteer in school activities. The overarching research question that guided the study follows: Is there a statistically significant difference in student learning A quantitative design was used to study the research problem (Pedhazur & Schmelkin, 1991). The analytical procedure used was a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). Transformations were used to recode parental involvement levels. Assumptions were checked for conducting the multivariate test (Stevens, 1996). Although the national database has private and public students information, the data included in the study were only public school Kindergartners. Demographic information included students race (53% white, 47% minority), sex (51% male, 49% female), and birth date (five years old). The independent variable was parental involvement level as measured on the school administrator questionnaire (parental volunteerism versus non-parental volunteerism in the kindergarten year). The covariates were the children pretest scores in reading and mathematics at the beginning of Kindergarten as measured on the child assessment scales. Finally, the dependent variable was the posttest scores in reading and mathematics as measured also in the child assessment."}, {"section_title": "Findings", "text": "Multivariate results showed a Wilks' Lambda of 3.826 that was statistically significant at .004 alpha level. This means that reading and mathematics showed an overall significant difference between the two groups (i.e., parental volunteerism versus non-parental volunteerism In addition, to further understand the research problem, post-hoc comparisons using the Bonferroni procedure were conducted. The post-hoc Bonferroni procedure showed differences between the low (0-25%) and medium The researcher found that parental volunteerism in Kindergarten raised the reading test scores at a statistically significant level. However, parental volunteerism in Kindergarten did not impact mathematics test scores. In addition, findings showed that parental volunteerism in the area of reading are optimum at a \"medium\" level (26-50%)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "According to Murphy (1991), efforts should be made to expand the \"school community,\" to unite parents, professional educators, businesses, universities, foundations, and the general populace into a collective force dedicated to the improvement of schooling for all children. For example, policies and programs cannot concentrate solely on the child, but most simultaneously address the needs of two generations the parent and the childfor they are interdependent. The issue is that most educationally advantaged students receive several times more education-relevant resources than most educationally disadvantaged students: most of this resource advantage is due to variations in family resources rather than school resources (Miller, 1995, p. 94).
