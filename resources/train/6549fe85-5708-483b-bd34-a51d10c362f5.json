[{"section_title": "Executive Summary", "text": "Increasing recognition of the importance of addressing climate change, along with Departmental-and Executive-levels orders have spurred a flurry of climate change activity in Federal natural resource science and management agencies over the last few years, leading to a variety of assessments, strategies, guiding documents, and new agency positions and organizations focused on climate change. This report documents progress to date in climate change adaptation by Federal natural resource science and management agencies 9 and tribes, providing a baseline for measuring future accomplishments. For agencies with a mandate to manage public land and/or water, the report focuses on: (1) guiding documents (strategic plans, climate change science and adaptation plans, etc.); (2) education efforts (for emplo yees, stakeholders and the public); (3) partnerships (collaborations with other agencies, organizations, and stakeholders); (4) vulnerability assessments (activities that evaluate sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity of resources to climate change); and (5) adaptation planning (efforts aimed at reducing vulnerabilities and minimizing impacts on agency mission). For agencies that produce science relevant to natural resource management, the report describes programs related to climate change science and adaptation and education programs. Accomplishments in preparing for climate change differ across the many agencies responsible for managing land and water resources and for providing the science needed for resource management. This is to be expected, given the diversity of agency missions, organizational culture, programmatic structure, and scientific capability. Nearly all agencies included in this report have prepared a strategic plan for climate change adaptation, and several have additional strategic plans and programs that facilitate some consideration of climate change in the agency mission. Most agencies have informal or formal programs to educate employees, stakeholders and/or the public about climate change. Several agencies have conducted climate change vulnerability assessments for several to many of their units (and species present on their units). Many tribes have also made progress in assessing natural resource vulnerabilities to climate change and have developed adaptation strategies and plans. Some coordination of climate change activities has occurred between agencies, particularly in partnerships such as the Climate Change and Water Working Group, which involves coordination among both science-focused Federal agencies and Federal water mangement agencies and the U.S. Global Change Research Program's Adaptation Science Interagency Working Group, which ensures that Federal science effectively informs adaptation decisions at a range of scales, in diverse sectors. Implementation of climate change adaptation has been slow, but seems to be most successful when national strategic objectives are linked to on-the-ground activities through a formal means of coordination and a system of accountability. For example, the U.S. Forest Service has a national climate change office, a roadmap that guides response to climate change, a scorecard that tracks accomplishments in ten areas, and climate change coordinators at the regional and national forest levels. Supplemented by scientific information from its research and development branch, the Forest Service is progressively developing vulnerability assessments and adaptation plans throughout the United States. Similarly, the National Park Service has a national climate change office, a climate change response strategy, and a staff that conducts scenario planning and other activities in national parks. National forests and national parks often collaborate on climate change projects where their lands are adjacent. Most Federal activities in climate change adaptation (those agencies that are noted in this document) focus on minimizing adverse effects on natural or cultural resources or facilities in order to support sustainable management, protect heritage resources, and provide for recreation and continued production of ecosystem services, including biodiversity. Adaptation is focused on maintaining forest productivity, protecting functional wetlands, conserving endangered animal species, and reducing road damage from flooding, to name a few. The Department of Defense also manages resources in the context of climate change and, in addition to developing ecosystem mangement adaptation strategies, is developing adaptation options to reduce impacts on military readiness. This report is a snapshot in time (2013-2014) of the status of climate change adaptation in Federal land and water management and science agencies. The number and quality of adaptation efforts that have evolved during a period of declining Federal budgets are encouraging, signaling that adaptation has moved from conceptual to real. In many cases, Federal agencies are leading the way in climate change adaptation, providing models for other organizations to follow. It is now imperative to accelerate progress in response to recent Executive Orders and document rapid climate-related change. Progress can be facilitated by increased cooperation among federal agencies and organizations in the public and private sectors."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Climate change poses myriad challenges to the sustainable management of natural resources on Federal lands and waters in the United States (Burkett and Davidson 2012;Staudinger et al. 2012;Vose et al. 2012;Brewer et al. 2013). Adapting Federal natural resource management to climate change is critical to minimize the risks associated with climate change impacts. To address some of the challenges of climate change in Federal agencies, President Obama signed Executive Order (EO) 13514, \"Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance\" (Obama 2009), which required Federal agencies to develop and implement \"Strategic Sustainability Performance Plans.\" These plans were required to include evaluation of climate change risks and vulnerabilities to minimize the short-and long-term effects of climate change on agency mission and operations. EO 13514 also required the Strategic Sustainability Performance Plans to include agency climate adaptation plans, which were first released in February 2013. These plans were to adhere to a set of \"Implementing Instructions for Federal Agency Adaptation Planning,\" issued by the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) in 2011 (CEQ 2011). In June of 2013, the Executive Office of the President released \"The President's Climate Action Plan\" (Executive Office of the President 2013). Part of this plan was focused on preparing the U.S. for the effects of climate change, and ongoing and planned Federal efforts to protect land and water resources in a changing climate were described. The President followed the Action Plan with EO 13653 in November 2013, \"Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change\" . EO 13653 requires the heads of the Departments of Defense, Interior, and Agriculture, Environmental Protection Agency, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Army Corps of Engineers, and other agencies to work with the Chair of CEQ and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to, \"complete an inventory and assessment of proposed and completed changes to their land-and water-related policies, programs, and regulations necessary to make the Nation's watersheds, natural resources, and ecosystems, and the communities and economies that depend on them, more resilient in the face of a changing climate.\" The assessments are required to include a timeline and plan for making changes to policies, programs, and regulations. EO 13653 also required agencies to update their climate adaptation plans, as per EO 13514, and provided additional guidance on what updated adaptation plans should include. Increasing recognition of the importance of addressing climate change, along with Departmental-and Executive-levels orders, such as EOs 13514 and 13653, have led to a flurry of climate change activity in Federal natural resource science and management agencies over the last few years. This activity has led to a variety of assessments, strategies, guiding documents, and new agency positions and organizations focused on climate change. This report describes past and ongoing climate change adaptation efforts by U.S. Federal agencies and entities that have a mandate to manage Federal public land and/or water resources, and/or produce scientific information relevant to climate adaptation in natural resource management. We document progress to date in climate change adaptation by these Federal natural resource and science agencies, providing a baseline for measuring future accomplishments. Whereas other reports have documented U.S. adaptation activities (e.g., Bierbaum et al. 2013, Hansen et al. 2013 and U.S. Federal climate change activities (e.g., Pew Center on Global Climate Change 2010, Center for Climate and Energy Solutions 2012, U.S. GAO 2013b), to our knowledge, this is the first summary of adaptation activities in Federal natural resource agencies. Because we wanted to put the focus on activities of natural resource agencies that are mandated to manage Federal public lands and water and/or produce science that provides the basis for public land and water management, we did not cover adaptation activities of all Federal agencies, and we did not include agencies that do not have direct responsibility for Federal land management. For example, the U.S. Department of Transportation may influence land management along Federal highways, but the land along Federal highways is not Federal land (it is state-owned). Similarly, the Natural Resource Conservation Service influences primarily private land management. Thus, these and similar agencies and programs were not included in the report. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change defined climate change adaptation as, \"initiatives and measures to reduce the vulnerability of natural and human systems against actual or expected climate change effects\" (IPCC 2007). To document climate change adaptation activities in Federal natural resource agencies and tribes, we focused specifically on the following types of information: \u2022 Guiding documents -strategic plans, climate change science and adaptation plans, or any document that directs the agency or entity in regards to climate change adaptation. \u2022 Education efforts -activities related to educating employees, stakeholders or the public about climate change. \u2022 Partnerships -collaborations with other agencies, organizations, stakeholders, or groups initiated specifically to address climate change. \u2022 Vulnerability assessments -any activities that attempt to describe and/or quantify vulnerability (a function of exposure, sensitivity and/or adaptive capacity sensu IPCC 2007) of resources to climate change. We used a broad definition of vulnerability assessments, since there is no standard within or between agencies at this point, and scope and detail of assessments is highly variable. \u2022 Adaptation efforts -any efforts aimed at reducing vulnerabilities to climate change and minimizing the impacts of climate change on agency or entity mission and operations. For agencies that are primarily focused on producing science (e.g., National Aeronautics and Space Agency, National Science Foundation, Smithsonian Institution, U.S. Geological Survey), we focused on descriptions of programs related to climate change science and adaptation, and where applicable, guiding documents and education programs. Some agencies play both science and management roles (e.g., Environmental Protection Agency, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Forest Service), and for these agencies we attempted to cover both scientific programs and management-oriented adaptation activities. Because of the different roles played by different agencies, section topic headings vary by agency in the report. The information included for each agency was gathered and refined in a four-step process. First, we gathered all available web-based information for each agency relevant to our information categories (e.g., guiding documents and vulnerability assessments). Second, we conducted phone interviews with agency representatives to verify collected information and gather additional relevant information. Third, we used information from the first two steps to develop draft report sections for each agency, which were reviewed by agency representatives. Finally, we incorporated revisions suggested by agency representatives into the final version of the report. The information presented in this report is a \"snapshot in time\" that reflects the state of adaptation efforts as of 2013-2014. While we attempted to incorporate as much relevant information as possible, the report does not provide an exhaustive description of the climate change activities of the included agencies. However, it is our hope that the information in this report can help Federal land management agencies coordinate and promote adaptation efforts. The document is organized alphabetically by Department or Office name and then by agency or entity name. A final section provides summaries and syntheses of agency activities, with conclusions on the state of adaptation in Federal natural resource science and management agencies in the United States.

In 1976, Congress expanded the mission of NASA to include space applications -applying space technology to advance fundamental scientific knowledge of our Earth system, solar system, and universe. NASA's Earth Science Division within the Science Mission Directorate supports a broad portfolio of research, driven by the goals of understanding how the Earth system is changing, the sources of change within the Earth system, how the Earth system will change in the future, and how Earth System science can improve mitigation of and adaptation to global change (NASA 2014). To address these goals, NASA and its partners have developed and launched a suite of Earth observing missions and ancillary satellites 10 . The Earth observing missions consist of satellites collecting land, sea, ice, and atmospheric observations around the globe, and these satellites provide longterm observations and information on solar activity, sea level rise, atmospheric and oceanic temperatures, changes in sea and land ice, air pollution, and the ozone. In addition, NASA supports wide-ranging Earth science research and applications programs involving thousands of competitively selected research tasks to advance science and understanding through analysis of NASA and non-NASA satellite measurements, as well as data from airborne campaigns and ground-based instruments. This work, coupled with that of NASA's partners provides much of the nation's knowledge base for understanding, mitigating, and adapting to climate change. NASA's climate change-related research and applications are guided by policy statements and other strategic documents. In response to Executive Order 13514 and implementation instructions from CEQ, NASA released a policy statement on climate change adaptation in 2011, directing the agency to develop an adaptation plan (NASA 2011). The adaptation plan titled, \"2012 NASA Climate Risk Management Plan: Managing Climate Risks & Adapting to a Changing Climate\" was released in 2012 (NASA 2012). A 2010 report, called \"Responding to the Challenge of Climate and Environmental Change: NASA's Plan for a Climate-Centric Architecture for Earth Observations and Applications from Space,\" describes how NASA planned to advance climate-related research (NASA 2010). Climate change-related research is also cited as a priority in the 2014 NASA Strategic Plan (NASA 2014) and Science Plan (NASA 2014). Adaptation Science Interagency Working Group April 2015"}, {"section_title": "Programs Related to Climate Change Science and Adaptation", "text": "As a leading scientific research organization, NASA engages in a broad portfolio of climate-related space missions, including research and applications activities that provide essential inputs for adaptation decisions. NASA supports fundamental research as well as applications activities, which are geared to addressing the needs of managers who must cope with a changing climate. While not an exhaustive list, highlights of programs of particular relevance are discussed below.\nNOAA supports a Climate Predictions Center under its National Weather Service. The Climate Predictions Center provides 8-10 day to tri-monthly forecasts and issues regular reports for spring floods, El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a, hurricanes, and winter, spring, summer, fall temperature and precipitation. The Climate Predictions Center also provides bi-monthly drought outlooks. These climate outlooks can be used by communities and land and water managers to take action before conditions develop. \u2022 Coastal and Ocean Climate Applications Program -supports research on climate-related issues in coastal and marine environments to aid stakeholders in decision-making. \u2022 International Research and Applications Project -funds research that integrates climate research and assessments with applied risk management and adaptation activities in key regions worldwide. \u2022 National Integrated Drought Information System -provides drought information for the U.S. and supports research on drought risk assessment, forecasting, management, and development of decision support. \u2022 Sectoral Applications Research Program (SARP) -aims to build an applied knowledge base and facilitate the creation and exchange of information to help stakeholders understand and address climate-related resources management issues in key social and economic sectors (e.g., coastal, water resources, agriculture, and health). \u2022 Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments (RISA) Program -supports interdisciplinary, user-focused research that improves understanding of how climate affects various regions of the U.S. and informs resource management, planning, and public policy. Climate and Societal Interactions programs work with other climate programs and initiatives within NOAA, including, for example, the NOAA National Climate Data Center, which helps make climate information relevant and accessible to people across the U.S. The National Climate Data Center currently manages six Regional Climate Centers, which are a Federal-state cooperative effort. The six centers are engaged in the timely production and delivery of useful climate data, information and knowledge for decision makers and other users at the local, state, regional and national levels. Foci of the Climate and Societal Interactions SARP are water resource management initiatives for coping with drought, and extreme event preparedness. The Program's goals are to: \u2022 Provide a better understanding of the climate-related risks and opportunities faced by resource managers and planners, and assess their needs for decision support tools, data, and information services; \u2022 Equip resource managers and planners with tools, knowledge, methodologies, and forums to cope with climate-related extreme events; \u2022 Help decision-makers better understand their vulnerabilities to a changing climate and plan adaptation and mitigation strategies in accordance with their priorities and values; \u2022 Infuse scientific information about climate risks and uncertainties into societal decision-making processes on local to national scales; and \u2022 Promote partnerships between the climate science and decision-making communities to improve societal use of climate data, forecasts, and projections. SARP brings together like-minded stakeholders and researchers to share knowledge, develop tools and best practices, and initiate mutually beneficial collaborations towards coping with and adapting to a changing climate. Lessons learned from grant-supported research are transferred to other locations and venues as part of the grant award. Examples of recent topics of interest include work on examining economic impacts and costs of climate-related extremes and adaptation; assessing urban areas' vulnerability to extreme hydrologic events; developing tools and methods to help decision-makers better understand, use, and communicate scientific information in planning and adapting to climate-related changes; and integrating climate data, forecasts, and projections into their management of water resources. The Climate and Societal Interactions RISA program works to integrate science in management and policy frameworks and promote relationships between scientists, managers, and policy-makers to help them make decisions in the face of uncertainty. RISA provides funding for research and information development that is relevant to adaptation of land and water management to climate change. The program was established by NOAA in the mid-1990's and currently supports 11 RISA teams throughout the country (Figure 3)  , and future collaboration with USDA Hubs is planned. A diversity of approaches is encouraged among RISAs, because issues of concern vary among regions (e.g., in the Great Lakes region there is concern about the potential effects of climate change on tourism, whereas in the southeastern United States there is concern about the effects of the changing conditions on agriculture). The research approach for RISAs typically involves needs assessments and identification of key issues; integrated research on topics of concern to stakeholders; and dissemination of information and tools to aid in decision-making. To date, research has focused on the fisheries, water, wildfire, and agriculture sectors, with more recent activity in public health issues and coastal restoration. See Table 3 for examples of research by RISA teams.\nThe USGS has programs within several mission areas, including Ecosystems, Natural Hazards, Water, and Climate and Land Use Change, which produce science and information relevant to climate change and adaptation. The Ecosystems Mission Area supports research and monitoring of freshwater, terrestrial, and marine ecosystems, and provides information to Federal and state natural resource managers to help them sustainably manage and conserve biological resources. The Natural Hazards Mission Area involves monitoring, assessment, and research on natural hazards, including many that are likely to be affected by climate change, including wildfire, sea level rise, coastal storms, and landslides, to increase public preparedness and resilience. Under the Water Mission Area, the USGS provides water data for the nation, including current and historic streamflow, groundwater, water quality and use data, and information on flooding and droughts. The National Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center (NCCWSC) was created by USGS in 2008 to assist land managers in meeting the challenges of climate change and its effects on wildlife. The NC-CWSC planned and currently manages eight CSCs, joint Federal-university partnerships, on behalf of the Department of the Interior. In addition to managing the CSCs, goals of the NCCWSC focus on funding and producing science that forecasts changes in habitat and fish and wildlife populations as a result of climate change; assesses species and habitat vulnerability to climate change; links physical climate models with ecological and population models; and develops standardized approaches to monitoring. Both the NCCWSC and individual CSCs rely upon partnerships with governmental and non-governmental natural resource agencies and scientists to identify key priorities to guide research, information collection, and development of tools for managers."}, {"section_title": "NASA Earth Science Missions", "text": "As of May 2014, NASA has 18 satellites comprising its fleet of Earth observing missions that study all aspects of the Earth system (oceans, land, atmosphere, biosphere, cryosphere). Measurements gathered from the Earth observing missions account for the majority of NASA contributions for advancing fundamental scientific knowledge of global climate variability and change and addressing the continuity of key climate measurements needed to inform policy and action decisions for adapting to climate change. For example, the Landsat Program, a series of Earth observing missions jointly managed by NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) since 1972, launched the latest satellite, Landsat 8 (formerly the Landsat Data Continuity Mission), on February 11, 2013. This latest mission extends more than 40 years of global land observations that are critical in many areas, such as energy and water management, forest monitoring, human and environmental health, urban planning, disaster recovery and agriculture. Other key missions include NASA's Terra, Aqua, and Aura satellites providing atmospheric observations; data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite missions, and spaceborne radar that detect rapid changes in the Earth's great ice sheets; and, the Ocean Surface Topography Mission/Jason-2 and Jason-1 missions recording measurements of sea level. For the first time in more than a decade, NASA will be launching five Earth science missions in the same year, including two climate-monitoring instruments to the International Space Station. The first Earth science mission of 2014 was the Global Precipitation Measurement Core Observatory, a joint satellite project with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency launched on February 28, 2014, that will help answer questions about our planet's life-sustaining water cycle, and improve water resource management and weather forecasting. The expected November 2014 launch of the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission will allow NASA to map Earth's soil moisture, informing water resource management decisions on water availability around our planet, as well as aid in predictions of plant growth and agricultural productivity, weather and climate forecasts, and flood and drought monitoring."}, {"section_title": "Data and Information Systems", "text": "NASA satellite and modeling products provide a huge volume of valuable data extending back more than 50 years across a broad range of spatial (local to global) and temporal (hourly to decadal) scales, and include many products that are available in near real time 11 . NASA's principal Earth Science information system is the Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS), which has been operational since August 1994. EOSDIS provides services and tools needed to enable use of NASA's Earth science data in new models, research results, and decision support system benchmarking; the system also improves support for end users. In addition, EOSDIS is supporting the Administration's Big Earth Data Initiative focusing on interoperability between environmental data systems at NASA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and USGS, and has helped pave the way for the USGCRP's Global Change Information System 12 . NASA Earth Science information is also archived at eight Distributed Active Archive Centers located across the United States. NASA also maintains a website 13 that features information about climate change, including evidence for climate change, causes, and impacts, as well as recent news and events related to climate change."}, {"section_title": "Earth Science Applications", "text": "The Applied Sciences Program primarily works through partnerships with organizations to find practical uses for Earth science data and scientific knowledge for decision makers and the public. The Program consists of four application areas (Disasters, Ecological Forecasting, Health and Air Quality, and Water Resources) and the Capacity Building Program. The Ecological Forecasting Application area draws on various Earth observation measures, such as land cover/land use, precipitation, and topography, as well as ecological and other types of models to address issues related to biodiversity conservation, protected area management, and marine fisheries. Natural resource managers, overseeing terrestrial and marine resources, are a primary user community along with others involved in the conservation and sustainable use of ecosystems in the United States and abroad. Some of the key adaptation-related sponsored projects include: \u2022 The Forest Carbon Management Framework -The Forest Service adopted this NASA Earth Science Division carbon assessment tool, which uses satellite imagery as part of an approach to enhance forest management. \u2022 The Ecosystem Assessment, Geospatial Analysis, and Landscape Evaluation System -Together with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), this project created an adaptable, unifying architecture that allows biologists and managers direct control and access to powerful data processing and modeling capabilities for landscape planning and management of focal species and their habitats. The Water Resources Application area supports the integration of NASA Earth observations and technologies into management tools for the water resources management community through a diverse range of projects in its portfolio, addressing topics including drought monitoring and mitigation, snow monitoring and runoff forecasting, water quality, soil moisture, groundwater change, and climatic and ecological impacts on water resources. Specific projects furthering adaptation knowledge include: \u2022 Enhancing the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Global Crop Production Decision Support System -The project seeks to improve USDA Foreign Agriculture Service commodity crop forecasts by integrating NASA soil moisture remote sensing products and land surface modeling/assimilation tools into the operational Foreign Agriculture Service global water balance modeling system. \u2022 Fallowed Area Mapping for Drought Impact Reporting and Decision Making -Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat data, the project demonstrated the feasibility of a remote sensing-based fallowed land monitoring service to improve support of withinseason decision making. This was a joint effort by USGS Earth Resources Observation Systems, USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, California Department of Water Resources, and NASA Ames Research Center. \u2022 Improving Water Quality Management Observations in Spatially Referenced Regressions on Watershed Attributes (SPARROW) -This project will incorporate data products from MODIS to enable SPARROW to produce assessments every season and annually, instead of every five years. The project will also evaluate the enhanced SPARROW in supporting significantly more cost-effective water management strategies. \u2022 Airborne Snow Observatory -Unprecedented snowpack maps from NASA's prototype Airborne Snow Observatory mission helped water managers for 2.6 million residents of the San Francisco Bay Area achieve near-perfect water operations during the summer of 2013, despite the driest year in California's recorded history. The three-year demonstration mission is a collaboration between NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and the California Department of Water Resources in Sacramento. The Capacity Building Program manages specific activities to build skills and capabilities in the U.S. and developing countries to access and apply NASA Earth science data. It spans nine societal benefit areas, comprised of the Applied Sciences Program's four application areas, plus Agriculture, Climate, Energy, Oceans, and Weather. Relevant programs include: \u2022 DEVELOP -Supports young and transitioning professionals working on applied sciences projects, including a recent water project with the Chilean Natural Resources Information Center, to create a methodology using NASA Earth observations to improve their water allocation process. \u2022 SERVIR -A joint venture between NASA and the U.S. Agency for International Development that provides satellite-based Earth observation data and science applications to help developing nations in environmental decision making. This program supports projects such as the Coupled Routing and Excess Storage Hydrologic Mapping Tool. \u2022 Gulf of Mexico Initiative -Projects include the Decision Support for Vulnerability to Future Storms at NASA Kennedy Space Center and also ForWarn, a USFS, USGS, and Department of Energy Oak Ridge National Laboratory collaboration with the NASA Stennis Space Center for early warning of forest threats in the conterminous U.S. The ForWarn system uses Earth science data from the MO-DIS sensors onboard Terra and Aqua to assess vegetation health and evaluate environmental stress, enabling managers to rapidly identify forest and wildland changes and respond to threats. \u2022 Applied Remote Sensing Training -Supports training modules such as flood monitoring using NASA remote sensing data. The Applied Sciences Program also helps to organize NASA's Climate Policy Speaker Series, a program designed to assist the NASA Headquarters community learn about climate and global change issues through briefings such as \"Building Confidence in Adaptation: Managing water resources across institutions, sectors, disciplines, and climates\" and \"The Psychology of Climate Change: Messaging climate change/sea level rise to your community.\" Adaptation Science Interagency Working Group April 2015 Earth Science Research Using space-based and airborne observations, the Research Program advances the interdisciplinary field of Earth system science to provide a scientific basis for major periodic assessments of climate change. These major climate assessments include the Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the USGCRP National Climate Assessment (NCA). For the past four years, NASA has contributed in a variety of ways to the Third NCA report 14 by enabling development of tools, providing assessment capabilities and products, and participating in authorship of the assessment. NASA also provides funding to investigators who will advance assessment-relevant science that can be available for inclusion in future assessments. Projects relevant to climate assessment include: \u2022 NASA Earth Exchange -Combining this platform with the supercomputing resources provided by the NASA Advanced Supercomputing facility at the NASA Ames Research Center, scientists have produced downscaled, high resolution climate datasets that make it easier for resource managers to quantify anticipated climate change impacts on a wide range of conditions and resources important to local communities, such as water supplies and winter snow packs, public health and the spread of insect-borne diseases, flood risk and potential impacts to critical urban infrastructure, wildfire frequency and severity, agricultural production, and wildlife and biodiversity. \u2022 An Integrated Terrestrial Water Analysis System for the NCA -The project will provide a multi-model terrestrial water analysis from 1979-present based on the North American Land Data Assimilation System atmospheric inputs. It will produce improved characterization of the continental scale water budget, which will directly improve the monitoring and prediction of climate-relevant water availability indicators, including droughts and floods. \u2022 CASA-CQUEST (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach-Carbon Query and Evaluation Support Tools) Modeling for Carbon Cycle Assessments in Forested Ecosystems of the United States -This project is producing and delivering assessment products on forest carbon and greenhouse gas fluxes, including appropriate coordination with NCA and other agencies, as well as delivering freely available on-line visualization services to support analysis and communication of results for the NCA. NASA also uses a wide array of research aircraft equipped with sophisticated sensors to advance Earth science research, and is sponsoring 12 flight campaigns in 2014 that will study the polar ice sheets, urban air pollution, hurricanes, ecosystem health and more over the United States, Central and South America, Antarctica, and the Arctic Circle."}, {"section_title": "Additional Partnerships", "text": "The Goddard Institute of Space Studies (GISS), a partnership between NASA and Columbia University, has a particular focus on understanding likely changes and applying that understanding to prepare for the impacts of climate change. GISS has been working with New York City and other governments across the nation and the world to help build climate resilience. Key products have included downscaled climate hazard information (Horton et al. 2011), and impact and adaptation assessment tools (Rosenzweig and Solecki, 2010). In particular, as part of the City of New York's PlaNYC initiative, adaptation workshops were developed that in addition to considering built systems, integrated natural and workforce/ community systems for a fuller sense of the vulnerabilities and potential adaptation options. The Climate Impacts research group at GISS uses observed climate data and climate model outputs (e.g., temperature, precipitation, solar radiation) as inputs to impact models to forecast regional changes in variables such as crop yields, water availability, and forests. These changes may then be evaluated in terms of economic and social costs, including the number of people threatened by hunger, drought, or coastal storm surges. Specific projects include: \u2022 Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project -A global community working to improve the characterization of world food security as affected by climate variability and change, and to enhance adaptation capacity in both developing and developed countries. \u2022 Coordinated Climate-Crop Modeling Project -This project aims to improve understanding of the impact of climate change on future agricultural production by utilizing site-calibrated crop models to coordinate projections of crop response under probabilistic climate change scenarios. \u2022 Urban Climate Change Research Network -A consortium of individuals and institutions dedicated to the analysis of climate change mitigation and adaptation from an urban perspective. NASA participates in the Earth to Sky Partnership (ETS), which is an inter-agency partnership between NASA, the U.S. Department of the Interior National Park Service (NPS), FWS, and University of California to collaborate on scientific and education products for educators. The partnership provides training and materials for NPS and FWS interpreters to help them communicate with park and refuge visitors about climate change. The material has recently focused on climate change education and communication, but ETS also covers planetary science and other areas of scientific interest. The ETS website 15 has archives of training presentations and examples. NASA is also a key participant in the Interagency Climate Change Adaptation Task Force, co-chaired by the CEQ, the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), and NOAA, and including representatives from more than 20 other Federal agencies. To address climate risks affecting NASA's own property and operations, agency science and institutional leadership formed a partnership in 2008 to apply scientific data and expertise to improve climate resilience through interactive workshops and adaptation-focused research. NASA's Resilience and Adaptation to Climate Risks workshop process builds upon GISS/Columbia's New York City adaptation efforts, targeting a federal rather than municipal client. Through this series of workshops, NASA initiated local ownership of climate risks for four-fifths of its land, two-thirds of its constructed assets, and most of its workforce at NASA sites across the Nation. Since integrating adaptation into planning and operations is inherently a local activity, NASA engages local governments, industry, academia, and non-governmental organizations in learning about local risks, assessing vulnerabilities, exploring prudent responses, and integrating top priorities into management. The local workshops spur community partnerships, inform NA-SA's annual sustainability and climate plans, and prompt policy updates (such as integrating flooding risk management into its land use and capital investment processes in 2013) 16 . In addition, NASA offered the expertise gained from these adaptation workshops to planners and other stewards near its Washington DC headquarters through the Building a Climate Resilient National Capital Region series 17 , a combination \u2022 Decision Making Under Uncertainty Centers-collaborative groups that, through research, education, and outreach, increase understanding of decision-making processes and of the information needed by decision makers; develop tools to support decision-makers and increase their ability to make sound decisions; and to facilitate interaction among researchers and decision-makers. Recent grant competitions have focused on decision making under uncertainty with respect to climate change and other long-term environmental change. \u2022 Long-Term Ecological Research Network-a collaborative effort among scientists and students studying ecological processes at sites strategically located around the United States, Puerto Rico, Tahiti, and Antarctica. The 26 network sites document long-term changes in plants, animals, microbes, and soils in relation to short-term weather and long-term climate changes. \u2022 National Center for Atmospheric Research-a research facility that houses a number of research activities in atmospheric science, including the Community Earth System Model, which is one of the foremost U.S. global climate models and provides climate model projections that are key input for the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, including the recent fifth assessment report (IPCC 2013). Scientists at the center use a collection of advanced tools and techniques, including models, radar, weather-balloon observations, and satellite data, to increase understanding of the impacts of global and regional climate variability and change. \u2022 National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)-a regional-to-continental scale ecological observing network that is under construction that will help increase understanding of the impacts of climate change, land-use change, and invasive species on ecology. NEON will gather data on ecological responses of the biosphere to changes in land use and climate, and on feedbacks with the atmosphere, water cycle, and other natural and human systems. \u2022 Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability programs-a portfolio of programs focused on helping society address the challenges of achieving sustainability. Funding opportunities under these programs are supporting a number of projects related to climate change and adaptation, particularly under the Water Sustainability and Climate, and Decadal and Regional Climate Prediction using Earth System Models programs. \u2022 Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems-a long-standing interdisciplinary program that has climate-and adaptation-related projects as part of its portfolio. \u2022 Office of Polar Programs-provides major support for the academic community for basic research in the Arctic and Antarctic, areas where key observational data on global climate change as well as societal and economic impacts on the Arctic are gathered.

These tribes are sovereign nations responsible for the well-being of their people and lands, and their natural resources are an important source of economic revenue and cultural heritage. Because of their ties to the land, tribal communities face considerable challenges from climate change. The effects of climate change have become apparent in the altered timing and location of culturally important resources (Cordalis andSuagee 2008, Lynn et al. 2013).\nThe mission of NOAA is to understand and predict changes in climate, weather, oceans and coasts; share that knowledge with others; and conserve and manage coastal and marine ecosystems and resources (NOAA 2010c). NOAA's Next Generation Strategic Plan cites a vision of \"healthy ecosystems, communities, and economies that are resilient in the face of change,\" and includes \"an informed society anticipating and responding to climate and its impacts\" as one of its long-term objectives (NOAA 2010c).\nThe USGS is a science-focused agency that provides information on ecosystem and environmental health, natural hazards, natural resources, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. The latest USGS science strategy (USGS 2007), which covers the years 2007 to 2017, established increasing understanding of climate change and its effects as one of six top priorities. The Climate and Land Use Change Science Strategy (Burkett et al. 2013) built on the science strategy and identified seven goals for USGS global change science and strategic actions that may be implemented in the short term (1-5 years) and the longer term (5-10 years) to improve understanding of rates, causes, and impacts of past global changes; the global carbon cycle; biogeochemical cycles and their coupled interactions; land-use and land-cover change rates, causes, and consequences; droughts, floods, and water availability under changing land-use and climatic conditions; coastal response to sea level rise, climatic change, and human development; and biological responses to global change."}, {"section_title": "Adaptation Efforts", "text": "Tribes have begun to respond to climate change in a number of ways. Drought, wildfire, flooding, and other extreme weather events are among the climate change challenges that tribes face (NWF 2011). Many tribes have already experienced these events and are taking necessary actions to respond to further threats. Several tribes in the west and southwest have created drought contingency and mitigation plans to guide actions during extreme dry seasons ( Table 1). For example, the Hualapai Tribe in Arizona has \u2022 A technical team composed of tribal members and other stakeholders spent a year gathering and analyzing information and developing adaptation strategies. \u2022 For the adaptation report, the team followed the strategies outlined by the Climate Solutions University's Forest and Water Strategies Program. \u2022 The Clearwater River Subbasin (ID) Climate Change Adaptation Plan (Thaler and Griffith 2011) focused on the climate change impacts to forest and water resources, and regional economics, and outlined adaptation goals. The Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians is concerned about climate change effects on the shores of the Bad River and Lake Superior. The Bad River Natural Resources Department is working with the BIA and the NIACS to begin an adaptation project on reservation lands. \u2022 The project team used the adaptation workbook from Forest Adaptation Resources: Climate Change Tools and Approaches for Land Managers (Janowiak et al. 2012) to consider climate change effects and actions for Bad River lands. \u2022 Possible adaptation option for increasing future forest resilience include invasive species monitoring, stand diversification, thinning, prescribed burning, and planting certain species, like white pine. \n\u2022 Climate Project Screening Tool (CPST) -The CPST (Morelli et al. 2011) helps Forest Service and other land managers integrate climate change considerations into project planning and develop concrete adaptation options. The tool involves a series of questions, both broad and narrow, that guide managers in evaluating projects and in determining whether or not climate change was considered or needs to be considered in project planning and implementation. The CPST can help managers address uncertainty by allowing them to explore potential effects of both climate change and management actions. \u2022 Forest Adaptation Resources: Climate Change Tools and Approaches for Land Managers -This report contains a collection of resources for managers to incorporate climate change in land management . Information in the report was derived from vulnerability assessments, partnership efforts, workshops, and collaborative work between scientists and managers. The report includes chapters on adaptation strategies, a workbook process to help implement climate change science into management decisions, and examples of how the resources can be used in real world situations. \u2022 Responding to Climate Change in National Forests: A Guidebook for Developing Adaptation Options -This guidebook contains science-based principles, processes, and tools to assist land managers in developing adaptation options (Peterson et al. 2011). Information in the report is based largely on knowledge and experience gained through a series of science-management adaptation partnerships established among Forest Service scientists, national forests, and adjacent national parks. \u2022 System for Assessing Vulnerability of Species -This tool is designed for resource managers to help them determine relative vulnerability of vertebrate species to climate change (Bagne et al. 2011). The tool uses a questionnaire of 22 criteria to develop vulnerability scores. Six scores are produced, including a score indicating overall level of vulnerability, four categorical scores (habitat, physiology, phenology, and biotic interactions) that indicate sources of vulnerability, and an uncertainty score reflecting user confidence in the predicted response. \u2022 Template for Assessing Climate Change Impacts and Management Options (TACCIMO) -TACCIMO 30 is a web-based tool that gives land managers access to geospatial climate change projections and peer-reviewed scientific literature on climate change effects and management options, relevant to their geographic area of interest. Based on user inputs, TACCIMO produces customized assessment reports summarizing available science and related planning information (Forest Service users only). The TACCIMO website includes user guides and training videos. Information is routinely added and reorganized.\nThe CCAR is the guiding document for DoD adaptation efforts. There are several identified areas of concern in the CCAR that are already being evaluated and addressed by the DoD, including coastal zones, the Arctic (Box 2), Alaska, deserts, and the Pacific Islands. For example, the DoD has been researching permafrost change in Alaska, and its effects on infrastructure, lands, and training procedures. Ongoing projects and future research will continue to increase the DoD's knowledge of climate change impacts and vulnerabilities, which will help integrate effective adaptation measures into all aspects of DoD operations.\nThe USACE seeks to incorporate climate change adaptation into its projects, planning, and operations, guided by an overarching policy statement on adaptation (USACE 2011c). An initial adaptation effort involved development of the report, \"Climate Change and Resource Management: A Federal Perspective\" (Brekke et al. 2009). The report was produced through the USGS by CCAWWG and includes chapters on adaptation and needed research. In an effort to understand the needs of water resource professionals, CCAWWG produced two other reports on climate change planning. The first report guides water managers in incorporating climate change into long-term planning (Brekke et al. 2011), and the second report focuses on how climate change is incorporated into decisions for shorter-term projects (Raff et al. 2013). These reports do not describe adaptation options, but rather set out informational needs and gaps in knowledge, and describe available tools. The USACE is currently developing guidance for considering adaptation in all agency activities, and pilot studies are being conducted to support the development of adaptation guidance and a portfolio of adaptation approaches (GAO 2013a). Fifteen pilot studies will be conducted nationwide to test different methods and frameworks for adapting to climate change; five of these studies are complete, and ten others are ongoing. The 15 pilots are led by 13 different USACE districts and address project planning, engineering, operations, and maintenance, and a variety of different infrastructure types, such as flood risk reduction projects, reservoirs, and canals. The pilot projects are expected to provide a body of knowledge and methods that will serve as the foundation for USACE guidance and future adaptation efforts (GAO 2013a). Sea level change is an extensive focus of USACE work (see Box 3). The scenarios laid out in USACE sea level guidance documents are designed to project future changes in sea level. Web-based sea level change calculators provide information on the likely impacts of climate change on coastal areas. These tools allow for adaptation options to be developed and built into project plans. The Responses to Climate Change Program was established in the USACE with the goal of developing and implementing policies, methods and approaches for climate change adaptation in USACE projects, systems, and programs. Additional support on climate change comes through the USACE Actions for Change program. The Responses to Climate Change Program has helped to support CCAWWG workshops, guidance on sea level change, and several climate change adaptation pilot studies at the project scale (USACE 2011b). Additional work has been planned to build on the foundation of the Responses to Climate Change Program and increase the sustainability and resilience of USACE built infrastructure and the natural environment through a framework and program of actions that will minimize the impacts and costs of global change. Initial work has focused on updating drought contingency plans, evaluating USACE projects with respect to sea level change, developing strategies to address changes in coastal zones, updating reservoir sedimentation studies according to strategic and priority needs, and integrating adaptation and mitigation (USACE 2011b). The following sections describe the LCC Network and CSC initiative, and how agencies within the DOI are responding to departmental directives through vulnerability assessments, and education and adaptation efforts.\nEach of the 566 tribes is sovereign, and the BIA cannot require tribes to do adaptation planning without adequate funding. In Fiscal Years 2011 and 2013, BIA was funded to provide competitive grants addressing adaptation planning. This funding was also used for tribes to participate in local LCCs and CSCs and attend conferences, meetings, and trainings related to climate change. In Fiscal Year 2011, 14 grants for $470,000 were awarded, and in Fiscal Year 2013, $600,000 was offered to tribes under the Cooperative Landscape Conservation Program. Leveraging of partnerships and funding was encouraged through the grant process.\nThe BLM began developing a comprehensive climate change adaptation strategy in 2013. The strategy builds on the landscape approach to managing public lands that has science and geospatial services as underpinnings. Data and information from regional assessments of existing and projected resource conditions (REAs, described above) and other large-scale assessments will be used to develop regional strategies to establish development, restoration and conservation priorities. Land use plans and plan amendments, cumulative impact analyses, and use authorizations will reflect these management priorities. On-theground projects will implement strategies in the field, and monitoring will be conducted to assess trends and adapt management practices to changing conditions. The BLM will build on current adaptation efforts, including greater sage-grouse planning, regional offsite mitigation strategies, and the Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring Strategy (Toevs et al. 2011). Reclamation also partners directly with FWS to co-lead two of the twenty-two LCCs and provides funding to its regional offices for employees to participate in their own regional LCCs. Reclamation relies on the LCCs to serve as a communication forum to facilitate engagement and partnerships with other agencies, stakeholders, and water practitioners. LCCs also work at interfacing the management and science communities through the DOI CSCs. Reclamation works with LCCs and CSCs to identify and address the climate science needs of water managers.\nReclamation's main adaptation work consists of basin studies for major river basins, or watersheds, in the United States. These basin studies assess the future supply-and-demand gaps and identify adaptation options in the context of climate change. Reclamation has so far funded 19 studies, beginning in 2009, and supports Federal and non-Federal agencies in compiling study reports. Reclamation has completed four basin studies to date covering the Yakima, Colorado, Milk/St. Mary's, and the Santa Ana Basins. Reclamation will be completing three more basin studies in the near future, covering the Lower Rio Grande, Henry's Fork of the Snake River, and Southeast California basins. The WaterSMART program is designed to progress from the coarser regional vulnerability assessments (WWCRAs) to more local-scale adaptation planning (basin studies) and feasibility studies. The next step in the WaterSMART program is to target promising adaptation options identified in the basin studies and conduct localized feasibility studies. These are likely to be large-scale projects that may require more detailed assessments to address all issues. An anticipated challenge to the feasibility studies is the ability and time required for stakeholders to absorb and act upon adaptation options. Despite this challenge, Reclamation is planning to begin the studies in 2014. The WaterSMART program is also developing guidance for incorporating climate change into feasibility studies outside of the WaterSMART initiative, and Reclamation is updating its Feasibility Study Directives to require climate change be considered as part of the without-plan condition, which is a characterization of future conditions without the proposed Reclamation action, but includes actions that may be expected by others. Reclamation has additional resources and support to help address adaptation efforts for water resource planning. Reclamation's Science and Technology program supports development of improved datasets, assessment methods, and tools that support climate change adaptation planning. For example, the program supported development of an online database for downscaled climate/hydrological projections, which were used in the WWRCAs and basin studies and could inform decisions about adaptive water planning. Tools development to assist adaptation occurs through Climate Data Analysis Tools grants offered through the WaterSMART program, where tool development priorities match those from the SECURE Water Act. Reclamation also provides grants for water and energy conservation and systems optimization. Reclamation works with partners to assess science needs surrounding vulnerability assessment and adaptation. A report by CCAWWG set the stage for additional research into user needs for climate change planning by including two chapters that focus on adaptation options and research needs (Brekke et al. 2009). Currently, CCAWWG has completed two user needs assessments for climate change and water management, which consider short-term (Raff et al. 2013) and long-term planning (Brekke et al. 2011). In addition, Reclamation has developed and periodically updated a literature synthesis on the current and projected effects of climate change on hydrology and water resources (Reclamation 2013). These reports are a precursor to adaptation options, but define the knowledge and tools needed to make informative adaptive decisions. Adaptation Science Interagency Working Group April 2015\nIn 2007, the NPS Director established the Climate Change Response Program (CCRP), under the Natural Resource Stewardship and Science Directorate, to develop a cross-cutting approach to climate change. In 2009, the Climate Change Response Steering Committee was created to serve as an advisory group to the CCRP and NPS leadership. Prior to the creation of the steering committee, several working groups facilitated communication and explored the needs and issues of parks and regions. With release of the NPS Climate Change Response Strategy, the NPS Director established a Climate Change Coordinating Group at the Associate Director level, which replaced the steering committee and oversees implementation of climate change response activities in all NPS programs. The CCRP provides subject-matter expertise, guidance, and technical assistance to parks and NPS offices to implement activities that support adaptation. In recent years, major initiatives have included resource vulnerability and risk assessments, adaptation and scenario planning, collaboration with partners, communication and training, and initiation of enhanced monitoring capability at 94 parks to address rapid climate change (NPS 2012). The NPS has conducted at least 18 climate change scenario planning workshops that included 28 case study examples. Some workshops met training or research goals, while other workshops focused on application to park decision-making or strategic plans. Workshops included representatives from over 89 NPS units (i.e., parks, networks of parks, and regional or central offices), and 122 partners (other agencies or non-governmental organizations). Climate change is being incorporated in key NPS strategic planning documents and guidance. For example, strategies to address climate change were included in the NPS National Long Range Transportation Plan (in preparation), which will provide a vision for transportation within the NPS and help to strategically guide transportation investments. In addition, NPS planning teams are completing new \"foundation documents\" for all parks by 2016, which describe fundamental resources and values, as well as priority issues and planning needs, and serve as the platform for all additional park plans. Each of these foundation documents must address climate change. To inform planning efforts, the NPS is analyzing spatial patterns of historical and projected climate for each park. Downscaled climate projections from global climate models used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2013 assessment report will be made available for every unit in the NPS in 2014 (through collaboration with the University of Wisconsin Center for Climatic Research). The NPS is preparing a \"State of the Park\" report for each of the 400 NPS units, incorporating information on trends in historical climate observations and projections. Additionally, the NPS is developing guidelines and strategies for addressing climate change effects on cultural resources (e.g., archaeologic, historic, cultural landscapes, and traditional use areas).\nIntroduced in the above Partnership section, the National Fish, Wildlife, and Plants Climate Adaptation Strategy (NFWPCAP 2012) is a large focus of the FWS climate change adaptation work. The Strategy was released in 2013, with the goal of providing the conservation community with a starting point for helping living resources survive the foreseeable impacts of climate change. The report documents current and projected climate change effects, actions for climate resiliency, and adaptation; guides implementation and integration of adaptive management; and encourages collaboration within the conservation community. In particular, the adaptation chapter introduces seven goals for managing fish, wildlife, and plants under a changing climate. The goals specify strategies and actions that can be taken to increase the resiliency and adaptive capacity of species and natural systems. Itemized checklists are also provided to track progress. Currently the FWS is co-leading a Joint Implementation Working Group with NOAA, the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission, and the state of California to promote implementation of the Strategy and report on implementation progress. Internally, the Service is also reviewing the Strategy and determining which aspects of climate change adaptation have already been accomplished within the agency, and which actions need to be taken going forward. Overall, FWS's approach to addressing climate change vulnerabilities has focused on both adaptation planning and field-driven adaptation activities, through a variety of science-based management actions and projects including habitat restoration and work to build resilience to sea level rise, removing barriers to fish passage, developing climate change information and tools, and planning for impacts to our facilities. The FWS also pursues adaptation measures through the LCC network (see LCC section above). The diverse LCC membership of state, Federal, tribal and private conservation organizations make them well suited to support regional adaptation activities through collaborative processes. Adaptation Science Interagency Working Group April 2015\nThe EPA released a draft of its agency-wide Climate Change Adaptation Plan for public review (EPA 2013b). The plan summarizes vulnerabilities the EPA is facing with climate change, introduced guiding principles and priorities for adaptation efforts, and provided measures to evaluate progress. Under the overarching climate change adaptation plan, EPA program offices (e.g., Office of Water) and regional offices then developed individual implementation plans. These program-and office-level plans address implementation of the agency-wide plan. The Office of Research Development within the EPA conducts research and assessments related to climate change impacts and adaptation. Different offices within EPA also complete their own vulnerability assessments and climate change adaptation reports. For example, the Office of Water updated its water program strategy from 2008 with the \"National Water Program 2012 Strategy: Response to Climate Change\" (EPA 2012). The strategy identifies options and actions for water resources to respond to climate change. The EPA Global Change Research Program's Integrated Climate and Land Use Scenarios project is developing future land use scenarios. These scenarios are broadly consistent with global-scale, peer-reviewed storylines of population growth and economic development that are used by climate modelers. These scenarios allow exploration of the potential interactions between climate change and land use change. With help from partners, EPA has compiled the third edition of a report that presents indicators, including ecosystem indicators, to understand observed long-term trends related to the causes and effects of climate change (EPA 2014). The report describes the significance of these climate-related trends and their possible impacts on people and the environment. The indicators are based on peer-reviewed information from various government agencies, universities, and other organizations. EPA also annually updates a \"Report on the Environment,\" which presents the best available indicators of information on conditions and trends in air, water, land, human health, and ecological systems. A substantially-revised 2014 version of this report is currently available for public review 48 . The EPA Office of Sustainable Communities Smart Growth Program has supported several climate change adaptation projects. For example, the Smart Growth Program sponsored a project in which EPA and FEMA worked with state and local leaders in Iowa to determine how information on changing weather patterns due to climate change could be integrated into local and state planning efforts to adapt to and mitigate future natural disasters. The program also sponsored a technical assistance project with the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments that gave local governments policy options to consider when preparing for climate change (EPA 2013c). Another example of an EPA adaptation effort is the Office of Water's Climate Ready Estuaries program that works with the National Estuary Program and the coastal management community. The program helps coastal communities integrate climate change into planning by providing tools to assess vulnerabilities, create adaptation strategies, and engage and educate the public. For example, the program developed a coastal toolkit webpage 49 with links to vulnerability assessments, adaptation guides, and other programs with coastal information. There are also EPA estuary projects outside of the Climate Ready Estuaries and National Estuary Programs, such as the in Chesapeake Bay Program, which has projects to examine how climate change affects both Bay resources and decisions about specific management practices designed to improve those resources.  (GCRA 1990). Since then, USGCRP has been assisting the Nation and the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global change through interagency partnerships, working groups, and collaborations with experts. USGCRP contributes to and develops several different types of reports and assessments, the National Climate Assessment (NCA) 52 being one of the most prominent. The NCA is produced every four years, with the most recent report released in May 2014 (Melillo et al. 2014). Compiling the NCA is a large task that involves participants from all aspects of the Nation's research community, including federal, university, nonprofit, and private sector researchers and decision-makers. The NCA describes climate impacts on different sectors and in eight regions, from the environment to human health, and describes mitigation and adaptation efforts around the Nation. In addition to the NCA, USGCRP contributes to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessments, produces annual reports, and develops strategic plans that help guide interagency research activities over longer timeframes. The annual reports submitted to Congress, called \"Our Changing Planet,\" highlight progress in meeting USGCRP goals, the use of funds, and future priorities. A strategic 10-year plan 53 for global change research was released by USGCRP in 2012 (USGCRP 2012). This plan reflects recommendations from multiple reports of the National Academies, dozens of listening sessions with stakeholders around the country, and collaborative planning among the USGCRP member agencies to direct the path for program in the next 10 years. Priorities for USGCRP over the next decade include advancing climate change science and making research on climate and climate impacts applicable to real-world decisions and actions."}, {"section_title": "U.S. Department of Agriculture", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Background and Guiding Documents", "text": "The USDA is responsible for developing and executing U.S. policy on food, agriculture, natural resources, rural development, nutrition, and related issues. The vision for the USDA in its most recent strategic plan is, \"To expand economic opportunity through innovation, helping rural America to thrive; to promote agriculture production sustainability that better nourishes Americans while also helping feed others throughout the world; and to preserve and conserve our Nation's natural resources through restored forests, improved watersheds, and healthy private working lands\" (USDA 2010a). Climate change has the potential to impede the USDA in meeting these goals. In 2010, the USDA released its Strategic Plan for fiscal years 2010-2015 (USDA 2010a). The strategic plan cited four main strategic goals, all of which had associated objectives (totaling 14). Strategic goals included: 1) Help increase prosperity in rural communities; 2) Ensure national forests and private working lands are conserved, restored, and made more resilient to climate change, while enhancing water resources; 3) Help promote agricultural production and biotechnology exports to increase food security; and 4) Ensure U. Plains, Pacific Northwest, and Southwest. The hubs are intended to serve as a source of data, interpreted climate change assessments and projections, and practical information to support decision-making and adaptation planning in agriculture and natural resource management. USDA vulnerability assessments, education, and adaptation efforts relevant to Federal land management are detailed in the U.S. Forest Service section below.\nThe U.S. Forest Service (Forest Service hereafter) administers over 78 million ha of land in 155 national forests and 20 national grasslands across the United States (Figures 1 and 2). The Forest Service is responsible for restoring, sustaining, and enhancing forests and grasslands while providing and sustaining benefits to the American people. The Forest Service supports both a research and development branch as well as advises and cooperates with private, state, and international forest land managers. Because of their responsibilities, Forest Service scientists and land managers are tasked with reducing the effects of climate change on ecosystem function and services. The Forest Service released the Strategic Framework for Responding to Climate Change (USDA FS 2008) in 2008, which included seven strategic goals to address climate change:   (Solomon et al. 2009). The focus of the strategy is to increase understanding of forest, woodland, and grassland ecosystems so they can be managed to sustain and provide ecosystem services into the future. Focus research elements in the strategy include: 1. Research to enhance ecosystem sustainability (i.e., adaptation research) 2. Research to increase carbon sequestration (i.e., mitigation research) 1. Assessing current risks, vulnerabilities, gaps in knowledge, and policy and management effectiveness; 2. Engaging employees and stakeholders to find solutions to climate change issues; and 3. Managing for resilience in ecosystems and human communities through adaptation, mitigation, and sustainable operations. The intention of the document was for individual units to implement the guidelines therein based on regional guidance; local (National Forest scale) implementation would be tracked using the Performance Scorecard ( Table 2). The Performance Scorecard (Scorecard hereafter) rates national forests on how well they are responding to climate change based on ten criteria ( Table 2). Each national forest is expected to meet seven of the ten criteria by 2015, with one criteria met in each of four dimensions, including organizational capacity, engagement, adaptation, and mitigation ( Table 2). Progress in meeting Scorecard criteria is overseen by the Forest Service Climate Change Advisor's Office (the Climate Change Advisor was appointed by the Chief of the Forest Service to coordinate climate change communication and activities within the agency). The Forest Service research and development branch and regional and national programs support Scorecard efforts, particularly on the education, science and management partnerships, assessing vulnerability, adaptation actions, and carbon assessment and stewardship elements.\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is the lead agency for most tribal programs and has a fiduciary responsibility to the 566 recognized American Indian Tribes that manage over 22 million hectares of land ( Figure  1). The mission of the BIA includes enhancing the quality of life and economic opportunity of American Indians, Indian tribes, and Alaska Natives. Climate change presents a threat to American Indian quality of life and economic opportunity. The BIA recognizes this threat and is in the process of developing an internal adaptation policy report to guide climate change efforts.\nThe NPS manages a National Park System covering over 30 million hectares of land (Figure 1) in over 400 sites, including parks, national monuments, military parks, preserves, and recreation areas. The fundamental purpose of the NPS is to conserve park resources and values and to provide for public enjoyment of parks while avoiding or minimizing impacts that would impair park resources. Climate change presents a major challenge to park conservation. In response to DOI Secretarial Order 3289, NPS released a Climate Change Response Strategy (NPS 2010). In the strategy, the director of the NPS also created the Climate Change Coordinating Group to guide the implementation of the strategy. The strategy provides direction to the agency and employees in addressing climate change, and describes goals and objectives of four related components (NPS 2010): 1. Science -Conduct scientific research and vulnerability assessments to support adaptation, mitigation, and communication efforts. Collaborate with scientific agencies and institutions to meet the needs of management in dealing with climate change, and apply the best available climate change science. 2. Adaptation -Identify and implement actions in anticipation of climate change effects to preserve natural and cultural resources and infrastructure under climate change. Use tools such as vulnerability assessments and scenario analysis in adaptation planning. Prioritize and implement actions, and monitor the results. 3. Mitigation -Reduce the carbon footprint of the NPS through energy efficiency and sustainable practices, and integrate these practices into planning and operations. 4. Communication -Effectively communicate with the public about climate change and associated impacts. Train park staff and managers in climate change science and decision tools. Building on the Climate Change Response Strategy, the NPS released its Climate Change Action Plan 2012-2014 (NPS 2012), which described high priority actions, and contained further guidance for National Park managers and staff on planning for and responding to climate change. The Action Plan included criteria to help prioritize actions in the short-term, and a set of high-priority actions that meet those criteria, towards the goal of incorporating climate change considerations into all aspects of NPS operations. Near term goals aim to provide a framework for building capacity and meeting needs for tools and information. The Action Plan also included guidance for preparing to meet uncertain long-term changes and circumstances. As a living document and a catalyst for response at all levels of the agency, the Action Plan is intended to be reviewed and revised regularly, with the first revision scheduled to begin in 2014."}, {"section_title": "U.S. Forest Service", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Partnerships", "text": "The Forest Service has partnered with numerous state and Federal agencies, tribes, and non-governmental organizations in climate change adaptation efforts, as described above and in other efforts. resource vulnerabilities for their land management plans, including the El Yunque, Francis Marion and Nantahala-Pisgah National Forests. Another joint national forest and Forest Service research vulnerability assessment effort focused on the vulnerability of watersheds to climate change (Furniss et al. 2013). The watershed vulnerability assessments, conducted on 11 national forests throughout the United States, were locally focused (at a national forest scale) and included water resource values, hydrologic reaction to climate change, watershed condition and landscape sensitivity. The assessments were intended to help national forest managers identify where limited resources could be best invested to increase watershed resilience to climate change. Forest Service scientists and specialists have developed several resources for use by managers in climate change adaptation, in the form of websites, tools, and reports. Examples of these resources are:\nThe USACE works in collaboration with many Federal agencies, nonprofits, and state and local entities, such as public utilities. Many of these other agencies and organizations are associated with water resources management, and the USACE endeavors to collaborate and partner on common issues (GAO 2013a). For example, the USACE worked with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), NOAA, USGCRP, CEQ, and the New York City Panel on Climate Change to combine sea level change knowledge and information into user-friendly tools 37 . The Climate Change and Water Working Group (CCAWWG) 38 is a partnership of the USACE, Bureau of Reclamation, NOAA, and USGS that was established in 2007 to facilitate collaboration on climate-related water management issues. The objectives of CCAWWG are to bring together the water management community, identify knowledge gaps in adaptive capacity to climate change, conduct research to close identified information gaps, and implement water resource planning training (CCAWWG 2012). Since its establishment, CCAWWG has added the EPA, FEMA, NASA, and USDA to its list of partners (GAO 2013a). The collaborative work of the group provides an interface for networking and contact between agencies. CCAWWG partners with other programs to meet its objectives, and recently created training material with the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) Cooperative Program for Operational Meteorology, Education and Training (COMET). The USACE also participates on the Interagency Forum on Climate Change Impacts and Adaptations. As a part of this forum, the USACE and NASA cohost informal meetings on climate change impacts and adaptation that are open to other agencies and interested individuals.\nThe BIA works with other agencies with tribal program responsibilities to provide services and deliver on-the-ground applications. For example, EPA, USGS, NOAA, and state and local governments all have tribal obligations; some of these obligations relate to climate change. Improved coordination of interagency tribal support of adaptation can build and sustain tribal capacity to plan for and address impacts.\nThe NPS collaborates with other agencies in climate change adaptation efforts. NPS participates in LCCs and supports four LCC staff positions. Several national parks have joined with adjacent national forests in vulnerability assessment and adaptation efforts (Halofsky et al. 2011, Raymond et al. 2013, and the Southern Sierra Conservation Cooperative, a collaborative effort involving NPS, USGS, Forest Service, and the University of California, provides information to Sequoia, Kings Canyon, and Yosemite National Parks and Sequoia National Forest to adapt fire management to changing climate. In conjunction with multiple agencies and non-governmental organizations, NPS staff members helped to develop a guide for climate-smart conservation (Stein et al. 2014). NPS also participated in the steering committee and technical teams that developed the National Fish, Wildlife, and Plants Climate Adaptation Strategy (described below; NFWPCAP 2012) and serves on the Joint Implementation Working Group for the Strategy. The NPS is also involved in several collaborative projects to support adaptation in national parks. For example, a cooperative project with the Geological Society of America and the University of Colorado is underway to develop sea level rise and storm surge projections for all coastal park units. A cooperative project with the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines, Western Carolina University and Duke University will develop adaptation options for coastal park units. Another collaborative project with the Forest Service, Great Northern Landscape Conservation Cooperative, Plains and Prairie Potholes Landscape Conservation Cooperative, North Central Climate Science Center, Greater Yellowstone Coordinating Committee, EcoAdapt, and Oregon State University, called the Northern Rockies Adaptation Partnership, will assess the vulnerability of natural resources and ecosystem services to climate change in the Northern Rockies and develop science-based adaptation strategies that can be used by resource managers to understand and mitigate the negative effects of climate change.\nPartnerships are a large part of FWS climate change work, in accordance with the focus on engagement in the strategic plan. FWS was the original coordinator of LCCs (see LCC section above), and FWS personnel still actively participate in all of the 22 LCCs. The National Fish, Wildlife, and Plants Climate Adaptation Strategy (NFWPCAP 2012) is an example of collaborative adaptation work by FWS and various partners. Development of this collaborative strategy was the top priority of the FWS climate change strategic plan. The adaptation strategy was spearheaded by FWS to create a high-priority climate change strategy for the broader conservation community and to develop an intergovernmental effort among Federal, state and tribal agencies responsible for wildlife stewardship. Along with FWS, NOAA and the New York Division of Fish, Wildlife, and Marine Resources (on behalf of state wildlife agencies) co-chaired the development of the strategy. Other state fish and wildlife agencies, tribes and tribal organizations, and additional Federal agencies were also part of the effort. The Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (the national association of state fish and wildlife agencies) provided support for this project. The steering committee for the plan consisted of representatives from 15 Federal agencies, five state fish and wildlife agencies and two inter-tribal natural resource commissions. The technical teams that drafted the strategy and the management team that oversaw its completion were also composed of a variety of partners.\nThe 2011-2015 EPA Strategic Plan states the importance of encouraging partnerships to effectively share knowledge and resources (EPA 2010b). The 2013 draft Climate Change Adaptation Plan contains a section specifically on the role of partners in climate change adaptation efforts (EPA 2013b). The EPA participates in the interagency Council on Climate Preparedness and Resilience, USGCRP, and other adaptation-related working groups. The EPA contributed to the National Climate Assessment (Melillo et al. 2013), and also to the \"National Action Plan: Priorities for Managing Freshwater Resources in a Changing Climate\" (Interagency Climate Change Adaptation Task Force 2011) and the \"National Fish, Wildlife, and Plants Climate Adaptation Strategy\" (NFWPCAP 2012), which are cross-cutting national strategies relevant to adaptation planning at EPA."}, {"section_title": "U.S. Department of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Adaptation Efforts in Stewardship and Outreach", "text": "NOAA also has stewardship responsibilities and provides information to facilitate climate change adaptation to coastal managers and the public. NOAA manages a network of marine protected areas, including 13 National Marine Sanctuaries and a Marine National Monument. NOAA's Office of National Marine  The Office of National Marine Sanctuaries recently released a National Marine Sanctuary System Condition Report (Gittings et al. 2013). The report provides a system-wide summary of the conditions of water, habitat, living resources, and maritime archaeological resources. The report also identifies emerging pressures and threats to sanctuary resources. Climate change (e.g., sea surface temperature variability, sea level change, and changes in living resource phenology) and, in particular ocean acidification, are identified as threats to nearly every sanctuary or Marine National Monument. The Climate Regimes and Ecosystem Productivity (CREP) Program provides Federal, state, tribal and private-sector decision-makers with information on how climate variability and change is impacting U.S. marine ecosystems and the communities and economies that depend on them. This information is critical to fulfilling NOAA core management responsibilities for marine-related fisheries, protected species and habitats in a rapidly changing world. CREP is currently limited to providing information, assessments and projections of climate-related impacts on living marine resources of the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska (North Pacific Climate Regimes and Ecosystem Productivity project). To provide information and projections of climate-related impacts on valuable fisheries and other marine resources, CREP works with many partners to collect data on climate, ocean and living marine resource conditions through a leveraged network of in situ and remote observing systems.  The NERRS Science Collaborative 31 supports applied research projects that actively engage relevant stakeholders sometimes address issues relevant to the effects of climate change on communities, including coastal inundation. Ongoing collaborative research projects relevant to the coastal inundation issue include \"Promoting resilient shorelines in an era of rapid climate change\" in the Hudson River NERR, New York; \"Assessing coastal uplift & habitat changes in a glacially influenced estuary system\" in the Kachemak Bay NERR, Alaska; \"Planning for sea level rise: A pilot study to evaluate and improve the development and delivery of habitat vulnerability assessments and adaptive conservation designs to coastal decision-makers\" at Guana Tolomato Matanzas NERR, Florida; \"Building the capacity of coastal communities to address climate change risks through the use of role-play simulations\" at four New England reserves, \"Collaborative planning for climate change adaptation: A case study in the Great Bay NERR\", New Hampshire; \"Integrating socio-ecological research and collaborative learning to promote marsh and community resilience\" at the Chesapeake Bay, Maryland NERR,; and \"Our Coast-Our Future: Planning for sea level rise and storm hazards in the San Francisco Bay area\" at the San Francisco Bay NERR, California."}, {"section_title": "Adaptation Science Interagency Working Group April 2015", "text": "A broader NOAA Sentinel Site Program was initiated in 2012 to leverage coastal monitoring and data collection tools, sanctuaries, estuarine reserves, marine protected areas, and other assets located in coastal areas around the nation. These places and equipment serve many functions, such as protecting natural resources, measuring tides, and establishing accurate height measurements. The first task for NOAA's Sentinel Sites Program is to shed light on impacts of climate change, focusing on sea level change and coastal inundation. This effort will gather people from many backgrounds and disciplines-NOAA and other federal experts, state and local government decision makers, university researchers, and other people who have a stake in a particular region. The intent is to create a cooperative atmosphere that leads to the development of novel solutions to real-world local problems, such as how to protect a development from rising sea levels or how to best protect a sensitive shoreline habitat. NOAA has sought to disseminate information on climate change and coasts to users through trainings and regional workshops. NOAA Sea Grant extension agents, NERRS staff, and National Marine Sanctuary staff regularly interact with the public and resource managers in coastal areas to communicate relevant science to users and to provide technical assistance in carrying out adaptation activities (C2ES 2012). NOAA also hosts workshops, webinars, roundtables, and other interactive events to help end users better understand what information the agency has to offer, and work directly with them to apply the information. An example is the training workshop \"Planning for Climate Change\", which was developed by the NERRS Coastal Training Program. This workshop introduces local and state planners to climate change, as well as the planning processes and actions that can help their communities prepare for climate change impacts. Additionally, the course \"Introducing Green Infrastructure for Coastal Resilience\" 32 teaches green infrastructure concepts that support resilience and provides community networking to advance resilience efforts. NOAA's Coastal Services Center, which is housed within NOAA's National Ocean Service, provides technology, information, and management strategies used by local, state, and national organizations to address complex coastal issues. The Center has offices and staff members in all six regions of the U.S. coastal zone (including the Gulf Coast, Southeast and Caribbean, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, Great Lakes, West Coast, and Pacific Islands), and helps local and state governments address the challenges associated with flooding, hurricanes, sea level rise, and other coastal hazards by providing data and the technical expertise in how to use that data to make decisions. For example, in collaboration with the Nature Conservancy, the Coastal Services Center developed a report, titled \"Marshes on the Move\", to help managers understand potential impacts of sea level rise on coastal wetlands (TNC and NOAA 2011). Another publication, called \"Local Strategies for Addressing Climate Change\" volumes one and two (NOAA 2009a, NOAA 2010b), contains articles about important coastal issues and profiles of innovative coastal programs. It includes information on creating a climate change preparedness team, identifying community vulnerabilities to climate change, and identifying, and selecting and implementing adaptation options. The report \"What Will Adaptation Cost? An Economic Framework for Coastal Community Infrastructure\" (Eastern Research Group, Inc. 2013) provides a four-step approach communities can use for a holistic assessment of costs and benefits of different adaptation approaches across a community, or to focus in on select infrastructure. Adaptation The Coastal Services Center developed Digital Coast 33 , which provides information for those working to address issues such as coastal conservation, hazards, land use, and climate change. The Digital Coast is founded on the need for geospatial data, but the premise of the site is that data alone are not enough; people need the associated tools, training, and information that turn data into information that can be implemented on the ground. Digital Coast aims to provide these resources in one easy-to-use package. Tools provided on Digital Coast include: \u2022 CanVis -a visualization program used to illustrate potential impacts from coastal development or sea level rise \u2022 Coastal Inundation Toolkit -provides context and guidance for connecting the resources in the Digital Coast to the needs of coastal managers \u2022 Coastal County Snapshots -provides information that can help communities become more resilient to coastal hazards by turning complex data into easy-to-understand stories, complete with county-specific charts and graphs \u2022 Coastal Flood Exposure Mapper -supports community discussions about coastal hazard vulnerabilities and assets with maps that show people, places, and natural resources exposed to coastal flooding. The current geography includes most of the Hurricane Sandy impact area (coastal counties of Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York). Expansion plans are underway for the rest of the East Coast and Gulf of Mexico. \u2022 Habitat Priority Planner -aids in making decisions about habitat conservation, restoration, and land use planning by providing a means of obtaining critical habitat analyses that are consistent, repeatable, and transparent (these models and tools will be validated under ESTCP). Active projects include those that examine the effects of climate change on Pacific Island and Southeastern DoD installations.\nThe BIA participated in the National Fish, Wildlife, and Plants Climate Adaptation Strategy effort (NF-WPCAP 2012); there was a representative from the BIA, tribes, or tribal organizations on each steering committee, working group, and writing committee for the plan. To increase involvement in climate change adaptation work, the BIA recently funded a national climate change coordinator position. Short-term goals of the BIA climate change efforts include enabling tribes to complete their own climate change adaptation planning through grants and training, and ensuring that all BIA projects and future plans incorporate climate change considerations."}, {"section_title": "U.S. Army Corps of Engineers", "text": "Background and Guiding Documents The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is an Army command responsible for delivering public and military engineering services to strengthen U.S. security and reduce risks from disasters. The USACE Civil Works Directorate provides engineering expertise to the U.S. by carrying out missions in the areas of water resource development, including flood risk management, navigation, recreation, hydropower generation, environmental restoration, water resource-related infrastructure management, and emergency preparation and response. Climate change will affect water resources projects and infrastructure operated by the USACE in many ways (GAO 2013a). In recognition of these impacts, a policy statement issued in 2011 (USACE 2011c) called for incorporating climate change adaptation in all facets of USACE planning, priority setting, decision making, and operations. The policy established the Climate Change Adaptation Steering Committee to coordinate agency adaptation planning. Building on the policy statement, and in response to Executive Order 13514 (Obama 2009) and 2011 CEQ instructions (CEQ 2011), the USACE produced a climate change adaptation report in 2011 (USACE 2011b). The report included information on USACE activities concerned with climate change adaptation, including its high-level vulnerability analysis, descriptions of additional climate adaptation activities and planning elements, current adaptation progress, and future priorities. The adaptation plan was updated and released for public comment in 2013 (USACE, draft). The updated plan is also included as an appendix in the 2012 Sustainability Plan (USACE 2012). Prior to the 2011 policy statement and adaptation report, the USACE had recognized the potential for sea level change impacts on its civil works operations and projects. The USACE has had policy on sea level change since 1986 and in 2009 released the updated Engineer Circular \"Water resource policies and authorities incorporating sea-level change considerations in civil works\" (USACE 2009), which set forth a multi-scenario approach for future planning and included guidance on incorporating ocean warming and ice melt in planning. Guidelines were updated in 2011 with another Engineer Circular (USACE 2011a), and the USACE continues to develop guidance on implementing climate change into sea level planning (Box 3). In addition to developing guidance for management in coastal areas, the USACE is also currently developing guidance to planning and operations staff for managing inland water resources under a changing climate (GAO 2013a)."}, {"section_title": "Education Efforts", "text": "Many USACE educational efforts are formalized through CCAWWG. With the UCAR COMET program, CCAWWG is creating a pilot series that will include self-paced online courses and live workshops to help water resource managers assess and prepare for the potential effects of climate change. The first product of this educational collaboration is \"Preparing Hydro-climate Inputs for Climate Change in Water Resource Planning\". 39 Additional courses on sedimentation and water resource ecology are being developed.\nA network of formal and informal working groups in the BIA and other agencies is working with tribes in climate change planning. These groups coordinate climate change efforts and provide climate change science and training. An internal communication network within the BIA has thus far focused efforts on tribes that are interested and proactive on the issue of climate change to help them incorporate climate change into planning.\nReclamation builds the capacity of its employees, stakeholders, and water practitioners, to manage water resources efficiently and with the best available science and practices. CCAWWG and the UCAR COMET Program are coordinating the development of a pilot training resources addressing climate change and water management. The first product of this effort is an online course, titled \"Preparing Hydro-climate Inputs for Climate Change in Water Resource Planning\" 42 . This is a self-paced course aimed at preparing water planners to assess the potential effects of climate change on water resources and incorporate these into management. The collaboration has subsequently focused on developing residence and virtual course offerings addressing specific natural resources impacts (e.g., surface water hydrology, crop irrigation requirements, water temperature, sedimentation).\nThe NPS has developed training modules and tools to help raise awareness among staff at all levels and disciplines about climate change. For example, as part of workshops associated with the NPS Climate Friendly Parks Program 43 (which mostly targets facility managers), NPS is providing basic climate science information as well as sessions focused on mitigation. A week-long online training called \"Interpreting Climate Change\" has been developed for NPS interpreters and others interested in learning how to more effectively communicate about climate change. This course will be offered twice in 2014 and is available through DOI Learn. The NPS developed a climate change leadership webinar series specifically for park managers and superintendents to explore best management practices and lessons learned for responding to climate change. This series was offered in 2012 and 2013, is underway in 2014, and will continue in coming years (C. Hawkins Hoffman and A. Richman, personal communication). NPS currently hosts a monthly web-based seminar series featuring climate change experts speaking on science, adaptation, mitigation and communication topics relevant to parks, which is open to other agencies, tribes, and non-governmental organizations. An archive of past webinars is available for the past five years. NPS has initiated efforts to engage park visitors about climate change. For example, in an exhibit project involving 13 parks, a series of waysides are being developed that will highlight park-specific effects of climate change and allow visitors to use quick response codes to connect to other parks and learn about interconnected climate change issues (e.g., glacial melt in Alaska and sea level rise in Florida). The NPS Mather Training Center is developing \"boot camps\" to train interpreters and educators in conducting facilitated dialogues with park visitors, and climate change is one of four key topic areas. The NPS is also part of the Earth to Sky partnership with NASA, FWS, and University of California, Berkeley, which focuses on teaching climate change science and motivating NPS interpreters to then develop interpretive and educational products and programs for use in refuges and parks.\nThe FWS National Conservation Training Center (NCTC) in West Virginia provides climate change education through its Climate Change Learning Center. Trainings, courses, and webinars through the Climate Change Learning Center are not just for FWS employees, but are intended to be utilized by the whole conservation community (e.g., state, tribal, and local governments, non-governmental organizations, etc.). Having a community approach allows for the climate change trainings, frameworks, and ideas to be widespread. This is well suited to climate change, which is a cross-boundary, broad scale challenge. One course at NCTC is on climate change vulnerability assessments. The training is based on a climate change vulnerability assessment guide developed by the National Wildlife Federation, FWS, and other partners (Glick et al. 2011). The training focuses on important issues to include when conducting vulnerability assessments, rather than specific methods to conduct vulnerability assessments that may not fit every scenario. Several of these courses were held at NCTC, but they have also been held around the country. NCTC encourages participation from scientists and managers from different agencies in order to enhance the discussions and create connections across boundaries. The NCTC offers several other climate change courses, including Decision Analysis for Climate Change, Climate Change Scenario Planning, and a 10-month online course called Climate Academy, which educates on climate science and provides adaptation resources. NCTC holds webinars on a variety of climate change topics 46 and strives to continually update its training to stay current and create a common language in the conservation community. Adaptation Science Interagency Working Group April 2015\nThe EPA climate change website 47 has basic information on climate change science, impacts, and adaptation in different sectors. The EPA website features a page devoted to education resources, which includes ideas for students to bring to the classroom and resources for educators to introduce to students.\nThe 2012 USGCRP strategic plan (USGCRP 2012) included education and communication as one of four main goals for the program. The need for public engagement and increased understanding of climate change science is recognized by USGCRP, and the program seeks to meet these needs through dissemination of relevant, timely, and credible global change information, while also engaging their stakeholders to better understand their decisions in a changing climate that help identify science and information needs. USGCRP also aims to strengthen the scientific workplace and increase knowledge about climate and global change in the research community. In keeping with both public engagement and science workplace goals, USGCRP held town hall-style meetings for the release of the most recent draft NCA. These relatively small meetings, held around the nation and open to scientists, managers, decision-makers, and the general public, focused on findings of the NCA for the specific region where the meeting was held. Adaptation Efforts USGCRP's Adaptation Science Interagency Working Group (ASIWG) 54 puts forth a major effort to inform climate change adaptation at multiple scales through actionable science. This workgroup was initially formed under CEQ, but was transferred to USGCRP in 2010. The group identifies research needs and priorities at local, regional, and federal levels and strives to bridge gaps in knowledge and communication between researchers and decision-makers. For example, in the latest NCA, regional climate scenarios were used to predict future impacts to resources in New England, and the technical information behind these predictions filled 80 pages. The ASIWG worked with the scientists to translate the technical text into a two-page summary 55 of main points that are understandable and useful to a broader audience. In addition to science translation, the ASIWG continually works to identify adaptation research and information needs from its stakeholders. One such effort to identify these needs occurred upon public release of the Federal Agency Climate Change Adaptation Plans in February 2013. The ASIWG began a crosscutting review 56 of the Agency Climate Change Adaptation Plans to identify common themes across the agencies on adaptation research and information needs. In addition, the ASIWG recently conducted a review 57 of publications, resources, and approaches around the world to monitor and evaluate coastal adaptation actions, as evaluating and monitoring effective adaptation is critical to improving the understanding of how the Earth system is responding to global change. Most agencies have informal or formal programs to educate employees, stakeholders, and/or the public about climate change. The FWS NCTC Climate Change Learning Center is the best known and most formal. Education takes many forms, including written material, websites, webinars, and online training packages. Face-to-face communication has been less common in recent years because of low budgets, travel restrictions, and the desire for agencies to reduce their environmental footprint. Many federal natural resource agencies have conducted climate change vulnerability assessments. For example, DoD, FWS, Forest Service, and NPS have conducted climate change vulnerability assessments for several to many of their units (and species present on their units). Many tribes have also made progress in assessing natural resource vulnerabilities to climate change and have developed adaptation strategies and plans. The geographic scope and level of detail of assessments and adaptation approaches differ greatly, ranging from watersheds to millions of hectares, focusing on a single resource (e.g., fish) in some cases and on several resources in others. While there is no standard within or between agencies at the present time, it is unclear if having standard protocols would encourage the proliferation of assessments or be considered by resource managers to be too prescriptive."}, {"section_title": "Vulnerability Assessments", "text": "The USACE 2011 Climate Change Adaptation Plan and Report included guiding questions for vulnerability assessments (USACE 2011b). These questions are meant to guide and inform USACE offices on climate change effects information and internal USACE vulnerability resources, and suggest other agencies developing similar assessments. The USACE is currently developing tools for use in USACE districts to screen plans for coastal vulnerabilities to sea level change (see Box 3 for more detail). The USACE also assesses vulnerability for different management sectors, such as flooding, recreation, and hydropower generation. An example of this type of vulnerability assessment is described in \"Social Vulnerability Analysis for Corps Planning\" (Dunning and Durden 2011). This report provides methods to identify vulnerable Adaptation\nThe BLM is conducting 15 Rapid Ecoregional Assessments (REAs) within ecoregions where BLM has surface or sub-surface responsibilities ( Figure 5). The REAs cover all lands within the ecoregion. Recognizing the value of existing geospatial data layers and models, the need to assess adequacy of existing data to address management questions in a relatively rapid process, these assessments compile existing information relevant to resource issues within each ecoregion. Teams of resource specialists, including representatives from partner agencies, are convened to develop key management questions for each ecoregion. These questions address conservation elements of concern (e.g., greater sage-grouse [Centrocercus urophasianus]) and regional-scale change agents, including climate change, invasive species, wildfire, urban development, and energy production for all lands within each ecoregion. Contractors then gather information and develop models that can help address priority conservation issues. Key REA results are presented in final reports, with all maps and data available to partners and the public for use and can be accessed through the BLM REA data portal at www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/more/ Landscape_Approach/reas/datadisclaimer.html. In 2013 and 2014, BLM publically released the Colorado Plateau (Bryce et al. 2012), Sonoran Desert (Strittholt et al. 2012), Central Basin and Range (Comer et al. 2013a), Mojave Basin and Range (Comer et al. 2013b), and Seward Peninsula-Nulato Hills-Kotzebue Lowlands (Harkness et al. 2012) REA reports. Public release of the Northwestern Plains (Ojima et al. 2012a), Middle Rockies (Ojima et al. 2012b), and Northern Great Basin (SAIC 2013) REA reports is expected in Fiscal Year 2014. In 2015, the public release of the following REA reports is expected: Wyoming Basins, Northern Basin and Range/Snake River Plain, Yukon/Kuskokwim, Madrean Archipelago, Southern Great Plains, Chihuahuan Desert, and North Slope. Public release of the Central Yukon/Ray Mountain REA report is expected in Fiscal Year 2016. Combined, these assessments cover over 760 million acres of public and private lands.\nAs part of the WaterSMART Program, Reclamation implemented the West-Wide Climate Risk Assessments (WWCRA). These are broad impacts assessments on water supplies, demands, and operations that are completed internally by Reclamation. The intention of the WWCRAs is to provide a foundation and starting point for more focused analyses in later stages of the WaterSMART initiative. At the time of this report, the WWCRA effort has completed a water supply analysis of climate change impacts to hydrology in the western 17 states, an analysis of climate change effects on crop water demands, which is due to be released in Fiscal Year 2014, and two WWCRA impact assessments on Reclamation operations covering the Upper Rio Grande, Sacramento, and San Joaquin basins. Future changes in climate and hydrology and future implications for water and environmental resources were included in Reclamation's report in response to the SECURE Water Act. These two topics were addressed by basin and can be considered brief vulnerability assessments.\nThe NPS is partnering with USGS and universities on vulnerability assessments that examine the three components of vulnerability (exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity) for specific ecosystems and species in national parks. For example, vulnerability assessments have been conducted for coasts and lake shores in 22 national parks, Mediterranean ecosystems in Point Reyes National Seashore, cultural and natural resources in three national parks in Hawai'i, salt marshes in Acadia National Park, grasslands and cultural resources in Badlands National Park, and bristlecone pine (Pinus aristata), desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii, G. morafkai), and Shivwits milk-vetch (Astragalus ampullarioides) in three Utah national parks. Other assessments in progress include analyses of desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) in nine southwestern U.S. national parks, giant sequoia trees (Sequoiadendron giganteum) in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, the Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis) at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, pika (Ochotona princeps) in eight western U.S. national parks, an endangered salamander in Shenandoah National Park, and threatened and endangered beach mice at Gulf Islands National Seashore. The NPS is also developing a risk assessment tool for evaluating climate change risks to park facilities, historic structures and other resources in coastal parks. This tool will characterize vulnerability and identify parks with assets most at risk. Still in development, the tool was initially tested in two case studies in coastal parks, specifically considering effects of sea level rise and storm-related coastal inundation and erosion (NPS 2012).\nThe National Wildlife Refuge System, which is part of the FWS, and the nonprofit organization Na-tureServe, collaborated to design a set of vulnerability pilot projects. The purpose of these projects was to identify climate change vulnerabilities on the nation's wildlife refuges and to develop management strategies to approach identified issues. The \"Vulnerability Assessment and Strategies for the Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge and Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge Complex\" report investigated vulnerability and management options for a large, Western-based, interior complex (Crist et al. 2011), and the \"Resource Vulnerability Assessment and Strategies for Management Options for the Eastern Shore of Virginia and Fisherman Island NWRs\" report was for two smaller, eastern located, coastal refuges (Bulluck et al. 2011). These pilot assessments produced two guiding reports (Crist et al. 2012a,b); a technical guide introduces methodology for producing Resource Vulnerability Assessments like the pilot studies above, and a manager's guide is aimed at assisting managers in using the methodology defined in the technical guide in practical terms (for example, costs, and timeframes for conducting a Resource Vulnerability Assessment). The nationally-coordinated Refuge System Inventory and Monitoring initiative works with partners to assess the status of refuge lands, waters, plants and animals, including recording the impacts of environmental stressors such as climate change. In addition, the NCTC course on conducting vulnerability assessments (described above) is a helpful guide for any agency within the conservation community that is pursuing climate change vulnerability assessments.\nThe EPA has produced numerous reports that provide guidelines for vulnerability assessments and/or assess the vulnerability of specific resources to climate change. These include: \u2022 \"A Screening Assessment of the Potential Impacts of Climate Change on Combined Sewer Overflow Mitigation in the Great Lakes and New England Regions\" (EPA 2008a) -assessed the effects of climate change on combined sewer overflow mitigation in the Great Lakes and New England Regions to determine whether the issue warranted further consideration, and evaluated the need for decision support tools and information enabling managers to better incorporate climate change into their decision making processes. \u2022 \"Effects of Climate Change on Aquatic Invasive Species and Implications for Management and Research\" (EPA 2008b) -reviewed available literature on climate-change effects on aquatic invasive species and examined state-level aquatic invasive species management activities and plans to determine their capacity to incorporate information on climate change. \u2022 \"A Framework for Categorizing the Relative Vulnerability of Threatened and Endangered Species to Climate Change\" (EPA 2009a) -guided users through a framework to determine vulnerability of a species to climate change, and several examples of the use of the framework were provided for users. \u2022 \"Assessment of the Impacts of Global Change on Regional U.S. Air Quality: A Synthesis of Climate Change Impacts on Ground-level Ozone\" (EPA 2009b) -provided information on the potential effects of climate change on regional air quality in the U.S. \u2022 \"Climate Change Vulnerability Assessments: A Review of Water Utility Practices\" (EPA 2010a) -described different approaches to climate change vulnerability assessments in water utility practices. \u2022 \"Watershed Modeling to Assess the Sensitivity of Streamflow, Nutrient, and Sediment Loads to Potential Climate Change and Urban Development in 20 U.S. Watersheds\" (EPA 2013d) -characterized sensitivity of streamflow, nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus), and sediment loading in different regions of the nation to a range of potential climate change and urban development scenarios."}, {"section_title": "Box 3. Addressing Sea Level Change in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers", "text": "The USACE has a long history of policy and guidance regarding sea level change. In March of 1986, the USACE issued a guidance letter to introduce the use of historical tide records to project future sea level. In 2000, the need to account for the possibility of larger increases in sea level prompted an update of the 1986 guidance letter. USACE \"Planning Guidance Notebook\" had a specific section on sea level rise that called for a sensitivity assessment for sea level change requiring historical sea level records to be extrapolated based on the potential for increases in sea level caused by ocean warming and ice melt (USACE 2000). The \"Planning Guidance Notebook\" sea level section was updated again in 2009 by Engineer Circular 1165-2-211. This new policy expanded on previous policy by requiring that three scenarios of sea level change be included in planning new civil works: a low-level scenario, which was the extrapolation of NOAA tide gauge records, an intermediate scenario that included potential volume change due to warming, and a high scenario that considered possible increases in ocean temperature and ice melt (USACE 2009). In 2011, the sea level guidance was updated again, including a tool to help calculate sea level change based on the three-scenario approach identified in the 2009 guidance 40 . USACE policy and guidance for sea level change is currently being updated (USACE 2013). The guidance will be published as an Engineer Technical Letter, \"Procedures to Evaluate Sea Level Change: Impacts, Responses, and Adaptation.\" The current 2011 policy has prompted development of a modified sea level change tool, which will enable calculation of future sea level change using non-NOAA tide gauges. To complement the efforts in sea level change guidance, the USACE is developing a tool to support climate change vulnerability assessments in coastal areas. The tool will help USACE districts assess the vulnerability of coastlines to sea level change and will be based on the sea level scenarios in the 2011 guidelines and the developing non-NOAA tide gauge tool. A more detailed vulnerability assessment based on monthly extreme water levels and three sea level change scenarios is also being developed for USACE planning use. These tools are set to be released for agency-wide use in 2014. populations at high risk for flooding effects and to incorporate this social information into planning processes. The USACE plans to conduct other inland vulnerability assessments in the future and is currently developing and testing a methodology for watershed-scale vulnerability assessments of its inland missions, operations, programs, and projects (GAO 2013a). The watershed-scale vulnerability assessments are intended to assist initial determinations on where adaptation strategies are needed and prioritize efforts accordingly (GAO 2013a). The USACE plans to eventually combine the coastal and inland assessments into a unified methodology.

The LCC network brings together diverse partners (states, tribes, Federal agencies, non-governmental organizations, universities, and others) in broad, collaborative forums to work together on broad conservation issues including climate change (see Box 4 for examples of climate-focused LCC work). There are 22 LCCs as part of this network, designated by ecosystem/ecoregion (Figure 4). Each LCC is self-directed and independent, with the agenda and goals determined by a steering committee. The steering committee consists of 15-30 conservation leaders. Federal and state agencies, non-government and non-profit organizations, and tribes and tribal groups are represented in the steering committees. Many, but not all, LCC steering committees identify climate change adaptation work as a conservation priority. The LCCs have two major guiding roles: \u2022 Coordinating and developing applied science for land manager use; and \u2022 Bringing together partners to develop landscape-level visions and ensure robustness of conservation planning approaches. LCCs provide a forum for existing partnerships and programs to develop common goals for landscape change and adaptation. These partnerships combine science knowledge, perspectives, and even financial resources, and are intended to allow partners to reap the benefits of the different agency resources. The goal is for LCC partners to leverage resources efficiently and effectively, leading to improved collective works. Because LCCs are a vehicle for identifying work and a forum for ideas to be realized, the LCCs themselves do not generally prepare vulnerability assessments, educational resources, or adaptation guides. Instead, LCCs mainly work through contracts with other partners and interagency agreements. Research and model development are done through partnerships with other organizations (see Box 3 and http:// lccnetwork.org/OurWork/Projects for examples). An integral part of the LCCs is collaboration with the Climate Science Centers (CSC -described in detail below). As a part of DOI's response to climate change, the CSCs provide scientific information relevant to land management, and the LCCs advanced landscape planning using the CSC science information. LCCs identify research needs that the CSCs can address, and CSCs provide the LCCs with direction as to what planning approaches are suitable. LCCs connect partners through working groups, symposia, workshops, and email mailing lists.

Climate Change Adaptation in Landscape Conservation Cooperatives", "text": "Many LCCs focus on climate-related issues. For example, the Arctic LCC, located at the northern most part of Alaska and Canada, works to have a better understanding of the effects of climate change on its landscape in order to inform decisions and adaption options for future conditions. Several of the Arctic LCC-funded projects emphasize climate change vulnerability, impacts, and projections for important Arctic features like wetlands, glaciers, aquatic resources, and bird habitat (e.g., Liebezeit et al. 2012). Another project developed an Integrated Ecosystem Model for Alaska (Rupp et al. 2012). This integrated model incorporates several pre-existing models for vegetation succession, disturbances, hydrology, and permafrost dynamics. The goals of this project were to utilize one model to forecast future habitat and ecological conditions under different climate scenarios, to improve the understanding of Arctic ecosystem response to climate change, and to inform monitoring and adaptation activities.

The mission of the FWS is to work with others to conserve, protect, and enhance fish, wildlife, plants and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people. Climate change is likely to have major effects on fish, wildlife, and plants in the U.S., and many National Wildlife Refuges and other field offices are already responding to changes to habitats and trust species on the ground. In response to this growing threat, a planning team within FWS created a strategic plan called \"Rising to the Urgent Challenge: Strategic Plan for Responding to Accelerated Climate Change\" to address climate change effects on fish and wildlife in three ways: adaptation, mitigation and engagement efforts (FWS 2010). The planning team also developed a draft action plan for implementing the strategic plan; although the action plan was never finalized, it helps guide FWS's initial implementation of the strategic plan. Adaptation goals in the strategic plan include long-term biological planning, conservation actions, and research partnerships aimed at increasing the capacity to help the nation's fish and wildlife survive climate change impacts. Mitigation goals focus on carbon neutrality, and the engagement strategy focuses on providing climate change information to FWS employees and external sources and creating partnerships across a broad range of conservation community members. A National Climate Team was created to implement the FWS strategic plan. The National Climate Team developed annual \"climate change action priorities\" in 2009 and 2010-11 to be completed by service regions and programs to implement the strategic plan.

In 2010, the Administrator of the EPA issued seven priorities for future progress, with one of these priorities focusing on \"taking action on climate change.\" This priority included integrating into EPA's future plans consideration of the effects climate change will have on its core mission. In 2011, in response to the implementation instructions for climate change adaptation set forth by the CEQ (CEQ 2011), the EPA released a policy statement that called for the development and implementation of a climate change adaptation plan (EPA 2011). It also directed that every national program office and all 10 regional offices develop an implementation plan to provide more detail on how it will carry out the work called for in the agency-wide plan. The EPA Climate Change Adaptation Plan, an agency-wide effort that was coordinated through the EPA Office of Policy, was released for public comment in February 2013 (EPA 2013b).

Regardless of the approach, agencies have considerable geographic variation in on-the-ground activities and in accountability for accomplishing climate change activities related to adaptation. There appears to be a growing realization that sustainable resource management and adaptive management in general, both of which typically encompass restoration and building resilience in ecosystems, are highly compatible with climate-smart management. Therefore, agencies can build on existing practices, adjusting them as necessary to address risks posed by a warmer climate. Employee education and engagement on climate change are components of many agency adaptation strategies. Agencies realize that adaptation is unlikely to be successful unless their own employees have a consistent, basic knowledge about climate change and its effects. Some agencies have encouraged this education to occur at all levels of the organization, including administrative, clerical, and maintenance workers, thus facilitating a true shift in attitudes about agency priorities. In addition, agencies already committed to significant engagement with local stakeholders in planning and project management are now increasingly including climate change as part of the dialogue. Public support is critical for implementation of climate-smart management, just as it is for other aspects of resource management. Partnerships (within and among agencies, stakeholders, non-governmental organizations) have played and continue to play a key role in nearly all efforts. For example, in Washington State, two national forests and two national parks led a collaboration in which over 40 different organizations participated in some way, typically along resource lines (vegetation, fisheries, etc.) associated with the specific interest of each organization (Raymond et al. 2013, Raymond et al. in press). Adaptation projects that include several partners typically generate more diverse ideas during workshops and more adaptation tactics that can be applied on the ground. Although these partnerships typically work better when built on established relationships and trust between Federal agencies and other organizations, new participants are finding common ground with Federal agencies based on how climate change may affect natural resources and restoration efforts. Although nearly all agencies have an overarching response strategy for adaptation and in some cases a framework for doing so, systematic accountability for developing adaptation options is still emerging among Federal agencies. Field units are often encouraged to consider climate change in planning and management, but are rarely required to assess the sensitivity of resources to climate change or develop adaptation responses. A notable exception is the Climate Change Performance Scorecard developed by the Forest Service to rate unit success in meeting goals related to climate-smart management, including adaptation. The Forest Service Planning Rule (USDA FS 2012) also requires that climate change be considered when new land management plans are developed by national forests. It is encouraging that some agencies are now including climate change in the development of target conditions and management actions in restoration planning."}, {"section_title": "The Role of Science-Focused Agencies", "text": "Using the best available science is a goal of most departments and agencies in adapting to climate change. They typically rely on information generated or funded by science-focused agencies (many of which participate in USGCRP), often in cooperation with universities, to provide scientific information relevant to climate change adaptation. The manner in which scientific information is accessed and used differs greatly, depending on the objectives of a specific project, organizations involved, and available budget. This diversity does not necessarily affect the relevance and quality of adaptation, and to our knowledge, no one has assessed whether adaptation plans within and between agencies conflict in any way. Partnerships between these science-focused agencies and land and water managers are playing a key role in climate change education and helping resource managers assess vulnerabilities to climate change and develop adaptive strategies in some locations. For example, CCAWWG, a partnership among USACE, Reclamation, NOAA, USGS, EPA, NASA, and USDA, facilitates collaboration on climate-related water management issues. The CCAWWG brings together the water management community, identifies knowledge gaps in adaptive capacity to climate change, conducts research to close identified information gaps, and implements water resource planning training. The ETS partnership with NPS, NASA, FWS, and University of California provides interpretive and educational products and programs for use in wildlife refuges and national parks, focusing mainly on climate change science and communication in recent years. The USGS has collaborated with some national park units to conduct vulnerability assessments and conduct climate scenario planning. The relatively new CSCs are beginning to provide climate change science to local LCCs. NOAA-funded RISAs have existed for nearly 20 years as university-based sources of scientific information, although direct engagement of stakeholders and participation in adaptation efforts has differed by region. In addition, during the past decade, Forest Service Research and Development has developed many partnerships with national forests to assess vulnerabilities and develop adaptation options. In our experience, resource managers in field units rarely feel that they have insufficient scientific information about climate change to infer the sensitivity of resources or develop adaptation options. Rather, they are often overwhelmed by the amount of available information and lack the ability to determine its credibility and relevance for specific applications. Science agencies typically focus on adding to this information base, fine-tuning projections of biophysical effects, and improving certainty about causation. In contrast, resource managers are seeking high-quality syntheses (as opposed to new analyses) and scientific information that is accessible (understandable) and relevant to applications in land and water management. In part, as a result of this mismatch in objectives, the number of on-the-ground adaptation projects implemented by Federal agencies is relatively small compared to the quantity of existing science."}, {"section_title": "Picking up the Pace: A Challenge for the Future", "text": "Climate change is currently a high-profile issue for national leadership in many Federal agencies, and recent Executive Orders have mandated development of and periodic updates to agency adaptation plans. At the field-unit scale, many land managers would like to develop vulnerability assessments and adaptation plans, but in the absence of a mandate and sufficient budget to do so, progress has been slow. The rate at which Federal agencies are developing vulnerability assessments and adaptation plans can be increased by mainstreaming climate change as a part of standard operations in natural resource management. Climate change is one of many risks to which natural resources are subjected, and most land managers already engage in risk management in making decisions about a myriad of issues that affect the condition of natural resources-adaptation is a new component of risk management. Thus, climate change can be incorporated in thoughts, actions, and management guidance, becoming a normal part of sustainable management, similar to the transition of ecosystem management and ecological restoration from concepts to paradigms in the 1990s. Including climate change as one many factors considered in risk management, rather than a separate \"special\" topic, will hasten mainstreaming while reducing costs associated with additional analyses. Interagency coordination is crucial to provide timely, effective mainstreaming of climate change in agency operations. Unfortunately, due to institutional barriers and diversity of missions, it is common for agencies to develop disparate approaches for any given task, often \"reinventing the wheel\" even if sharing of information and processes would improve efficiency. For example, applying tactics such as managed species relocation in the name of adaptation, but without coordinating with others, may be maladaptive to broader goals for adaptation. Adaptation progress can be accelerated through increased cooperation between management-based and science-based agencies and through collaboration with other organizations in the public and private sectors. At the national level, coordination can occur through the efforts of USGCRP and other interagency working groups. At the regional to local levels, interaction among leadership and resource staff directors across agencies seems to be the most effective. Opportunities for shared learning can be created. Climate change research programs will have maximum utility if they explicitly inform specific resource management and policy issues-these linkages are needed at the national, regional, and local scales. Interagency coordination can reduce redundancy and competition across scientific programs, facilitate synthesis and delivery of data to practitioners in accessible formats, and ensure that future research is relevant for adaptation. Accelerating climate change adaptation during a period of flat or declining budgets will be challenging, because the ability of most agencies to meet their current missions is already stretched to capacity. Nevertheless, we must face the reality that the magnitude of the effects of climate change-sea level rise, wildfire, insects, invasive species, etc.-may override the \"normal\" range of variability currently addressed by resource management and policy, with implications for sustainable resource production, local economies, and community stability. Each year that climate change adaptation is delayed narrows the window of opportunity for effective actions. A timely, coordinated response by Federal agencies will ensure that a maximum number of viable adaptation options are both available and implemented.   (Table 4 continued "}]
