A look at the geographic reach of these activities offers some indication of their importance. The state's farms combined to cover nearly two-thirds of Indiana's total land area in 2012, while our forests cover another 20 percent of the state.\nThe economic contributions of agriculture also extend beyond the farm and forest. Indiana is home to many agriculture-related processing and manufacturing establishments, such as grain milling operations or sawmills. These establishments are found all over the state-from our largest cities to our more rural areas, and they employ nearly 29,000 Hoosiers.\nThe economic activity generated by these various activities packs a powerful punch, but the full economic contributions of Indiana agriculture are not well known. This report aims to provide comprehensive estimates of the total economic footprint of Indiana agriculture. The analysis includes estimates of the total value of sales, gross domestic product (GDP) and employment directly linked to agriculture-related industries, as well as the economic ripple effects that these activities generate in other industries around the state. The estimates are presented at the state level, as well as for Indiana's congressional districts and its U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) crop reporting districts."}, {"section_title": "Key Findings", "text": "\u2022 The total direct value of sales for all Indiana agriculture-related industries was an estimated $31.2 billion in 2012. The economic ripple effects of these saleswhich refer to supply chain purchases and the household spending of workers-generated another $12.9 billion in sales. Add these effects together, and agriculture's total impact on sales was an estimated $44.1 billion in 2012.\n\u2022 A better way to measure the effect of agriculture on Indiana's economy is to look its contribution to GDP (or value added). The combined effects of agriculture (i.e., direct effects + ripple effects) generated an estimated $14.9 billion in value added-which accounts for nearly 5 percent of the state's total GDP. \u2022 The value added multiplier effect was 1.88, meaning that every dollar of GDP created directly by agriculture industries generates another $0.88 in economic activity in other industries in the state.\n\u2022 The total GDP contributions of agriculture are split almost evenly between agricultural production industries ($7.44 billion) and agriculture-related manufacturing ($7.46 billion).\n\u2022 The state's agriculture industries combine to employ more than 107,500 direct workers. Add in the ripple effects, and the total climbs to 188,600 jobs in Indiana. The ratio of direct jobs to total jobs yields a multiplier of 1.8, meaning that every 10 jobs directly related to agriculture support an additional eight jobs in the state.\n\u2022 Looking at specific industries, grain and oilseed (i.e., soybeans) farming dominate the economic contributions of agriculture. These two industries account for 40 percent of agriculture's total employment effect and 31 percent of agricultural GDP.\n\u2022 Indiana ranks 10th among states in crop and livestock production with total sales at $11.2 billion in 2012. The state ranked in the top five in the production of corn, soybeans, and hogs and pigs."}, {"section_title": "Executive Summary", "text": "Every dollar of GDP created directly by agriculture industries generates another $0.88 in economic activity in other industries in the state.\nA s of 2012, Indiana was home to nearly 58,700 individual farms covering more than 14.7 million acres, which accounts for 64 percent of the state's total land area. Hoosier farmers combined to sell $11.2 billion worth of unprocessed agricultural commodities in that same year-a tally which ranked as the 10th-highest total among states (see Figure 1) . With $42.6 billion in commodity sales in 2012, California is far and away the nation's top agricultural producer, followed by Iowa ($30.8 billion) and Texas ($25.4 billion). Indiana ranked just behind North Carolina ($12.6 billion) and Wisconsin ($11.7 billion), but ahead of North Dakota ($11.0 billion), South Dakota ($10.2 billion) and Ohio ($10.1 billion).\nIndiana's agricultural production is heavily concentrated in corn and soybean growing. The state ranked fifth and fourth, respectively, among states in the value of sales of these commodities in 2012 (see Table 1 ). What's more, these two crops alone combined to account for 63 percent of the state's total value of agriculture production. By contrast, these commodities generated just 27 percent of the value of sales nationally in 2012. Only Illinois had a larger share of total sales claimed by these two crops at 77 percent.\nIndiana was also a national leader in hog and pig production in 2012. Hoosier hog farmers generated nearly $1.3 billion in sales-the fifth-highest total nationally. Poultry and egg production was the only other agriculture industry in the state to top $1 billion in sales in 2012. The nearly $1.3 billion in sales in this industry ranked as 13th-best among states. Indiana actually ranks much higher in some of the key industries under the umbrella of \"poultry and eggs.\" Based on production levels (USDA does not publish value of sales figures for these specific industries), the state ranks sixth for turkey production and seventh for Indiana Agriculture by the Numbers eggs. Other industries where Indiana ranked in the top 15 states were milk from cows; horses, ponies, etc.; and tobacco. Table 2 highlights changes in the volume of production for some of Indiana's key commodities between 2007 and 2012 (the last two USDA Census of Agriculture years). The nearly 40 percent decline in the volume of corn produced for grain certainly leaps out. This drop is due in large part to the severe drought in some regions of the country (including Indiana) in 2012. Other Midwestern states like Missouri and Illinois saw even sharper declines in grain corn production over this period. It is important to point out that Indiana rebounded to tally two consecutive record years for grain corn production in 2013 and 2014. According to the USDA's annual surveys, Indiana topped 1 billion bushels in each of these years, marking the first time the state has ever eclipsed this mark.\nAnother factor in this decline was a shift in the types of crops planted in these two years. Comparing 2012 to 2007, Indiana crop farmers dedicated roughly 326,000 fewer acres of land to grain corn but planted 360,000 more acres in soybeans. This shift helps to explain how the state increased soybean production during a drought year. The state also saw volume increases in each of its major animal agriculture industries over this period. This section of the report provides estimates of the full economic contributions of Indiana agriculture. For this analysis, the Indiana Business Research Center (IBRC) research team considered two types of activities: agricultural production and agriculture-dependent processing or manufacturing industries. Production refers to the crop and livestock industries covered in the previous section as well as forestry and agricultural support services. Within the NAICS industry classification scheme, production activities refer to any industry classified in sector 11 with the exception of fishing, hunting and trapping (subsector 114). The processing and manufacturing activities refer to industries that utilize farm and forest production as the key input into their finished goods. All of these industries are classified under NAICS sectors 31 or 32. Examples include fruit and vegetable canning, animal processing, ethanol production, and veneer and plywood manufacturing, to name a few."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": "The IBRC research team used the IMPLAN economic modeling software to estimate the total economic effect of Indiana agriculture and forestry. The IMPLAN model draws from a variety of secondary data sources to provide a detailed account of the Indiana economy. For example, the model indicates that Indiana sawmills purchase nearly 50 percent of their production inputs from other Hoosier establishments. The estimated economic effects of these supply chain purchases are reported in the \"indirect effects\" columns in the tables. Additionally, workers in the agriculture production and processing industriesas well as employees at supplier firmsspend their earnings on food, housing, health care, entertainment, etc. The estimated ripple effects from this household spending are presented in the \"induced effects\" columns."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": "The research team made some adjustments to the IMPLAN model to eliminate any potential double counting in the following estimates. Without any adjustments, the impact of agriculture could be inflated when the effects of closely related industries are added together. Take the corn production and corn milling industries, for instance. Milling operations buy a portion of Indiana's corn production, which they use as an input to produce oils, sweeteners, starches, etc. If the IBRC did not adjust the model, then the value of the corn would be counted twice-once as the sale of raw corn and again as an input in the sale of the processed goods. These types of supply linkages are present throughout agriculture and forestry.\nThe adjustments to the model eliminate these intra-agriculture relationships within Indiana and, thus, avoid the double counting that would otherwise appear in the indirect and induced output effects. These adjustments also allow for valid estimates of all value added effects (which already removes the value of production inputs) and employment effects, but they do not remove the double counting reported in the direct output effects. Therefore, the value added and employment numbers offer the best measures of the industry's contributions to the Indiana economy."}, {"section_title": "Summary of Economic Contributions", "text": "In 2012, Indiana's agriculture-and forestry-related establishments combined to generate an estimated $31.2 billion in direct economic output-a measure which is analogous to total sales (see Table  3 ). In addition to these direct effects, the state's agriculture producers and manufacturers triggered an estimated $8.2 billion in additional economic activity in the state when they purchased inputs from Indiana-based suppliers. The household spending of agricultural employees, as well as that of employees in the supply chain, supported another $4.7 billion in economic output. All told, the total economic output footprint of Indiana's agriculture and forestry industries was nearly $44.1 billion in 2012.\nThe multiplier offers a useful way to interpret these ripple effects. The ratio of total effects to direct output yields a multiplier of 1.41, meaning that each dollar of output generated by Indiana's agriculture and forestry establishments stimulates another $0.41 in economic activity in the state.\nWith an estimated total output effect of nearly $25.8 billion, the state's processing and manufacturing industries accounted for nearly 59 percent of Indiana agriculture's total economic footprint in 2012. While the state's production industries may have had a smaller contribution to total output, their output multiplier effect of 1.57 was quite a bit stronger.\nEconomic output estimates are useful \"headline numbers\" in that they provide an approximate sales total and most people readily understand the concept of a dollar's worth of sales. That said, the value added metric provides a more meaningful appraisal of agriculture's contribution to Indiana's economy because this measure is analogous to the official GDP figures released at the national or state level. As the second section of Table 3 shows, Indiana's agriculturerelated establishments combined to generate an estimated $7.9 billion in direct value added in 2012. This level of activity triggered nearly $7.0 billion in indirect and induced effects throughout the state to bring the industry's total value added impact to $14.9 billion. In 2012, the state's total value added was roughly $306 billion, which means that the combined effects of agriculture and forestry accounted for 4.9 percent of Indiana's GDP in that year.\nAs for employment, more than 107,500 jobs in Indiana were directly related to agricultural production and processing in 2012. Nearly 75 percent of these direct jobs were in the state's agricultural production industries. The purchase of production inputs from Indiana-based suppliers supported an estimated 40,450 additional jobs in the state, while the household spending of direct and indirect workers accounted for another 40,660 jobs. In all, the total employment footprint of agriculture-and forestry-related industries in the state was an estimated 188,640 jobs in 2012. The ratio of total employment effects to direct employment gives a multiplier of 1.8, meaning that every 10 jobs directly related to Indiana agriculture and forestry supported an additional 8 jobs in the state."}, {"section_title": "Economic Contributions by Industry", "text": "With Indiana ranking among the top five states in the production of corn, soybeans and hogs, it is no surprise that these three industries dominate the state's agricultural employment. As of 2012, nearly one-third of Indiana's direct agriculture and forestry workers were engaged in corn, wheat, and other grain farming (see Table 4 ). Add in soybean and other oilseed farming and hog production, and these three industries combine to account for six out of every 10 direct agricultural workers in the state. The ripple effects of Indiana's grain production in 2012 supported an estimated 14,970 additional jobs around the state while soybean and other oilseed farming and hog production combined to generate an estimated 14,030 additional jobs in other non-agriculture industries. In total, these three industries were responsible for nearly 93,600 jobs in 2012. Among other agriculture industries, non-poultry animal processing had the next largest total employment impact (10,010 jobs) followed by agricultural support services (9,520), and wet corn milling (9,390)."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "While Indiana's \"big three\" production industries account for a large share of agriculture's total employment effect, the state's processing and manufacturing industries tend to have larger employment multipliers. Wet corn milling, for instance, has an employment multiplier above 7, while fats and oils refining and flour milling are not far behind at 6.8 and 4.4, respectively. Taken as a group, Indiana's agricultural processing industries have an employment multiplier of 2.5 compared to 1.5 for farm production. Industries with large employment multipliers are those that tend to be production input-intensive, meaning that they engage very long supply chains while producing their output with relatively few direct employees.\nAs with the employment effects, grain and soybean production are easily agriculture's top contributors to Indiana value added (see Table 5 ). The combined effects of corn, wheat, and other grain production totaled an estimated $2.4 billion in value added in 2012, while the direct and ripple effects of soybean and other oilseed farming in the state were an estimated $2.3 billion. Again, given that the state's total value added of $306 billion in 2012, the combined effects of these two industries represent 1.5 percent of Indiana's GDP. The wet corn milling ($1.1 billion in value added), milk and butter manufacturing ($991 million), and fruit and vegetable canning ($934 million) industries round out the top five generators of GDP. Table 6 shows, the economic activity related to Indiana agriculture and forestry generated an estimated $911 million in state and local revenue in 2012 and over $1.6 billion in federal collections."}, {"section_title": "Agriculture's Impact in Indiana Regions", "text": "When it comes to the economic impacts of agriculture, there is quite a bit of variation between different regions of the state. The Central, North Central and Northeast regions (see Figure 2 for reference) generate the greatest contributions to the Indiana economy. The Southwest region is also a strong contributor, particularly in the agricultural processing and Table 7 presents the value added and employment effects of agriculture in each USDA-defined crop reporting district. The Central region leads all areas in both categories, contributing slightly more than $4.3 billion in total GDP to the district and supporting an estimated 43,840 total jobs. Not only is the Central region a strong agricultural producer, but it's also the state's most populous and economically diverse area, which explains the large multiplier effects. The North Central and Northeast regions place second and third, respectively, in each measure. Together, these top three regions account for 58 percent of the value added that agriculture generates in Indiana and 56 percent of the jobs.\nFor a more complete look at the impact of agriculture in each region, see the district-specific fact sheets beginning on page 10 of this report."}, {"section_title": "Agriculture's Impact in Indiana Congressional Districts", "text": "As with the crop reporting districts, there are wide disparities in the economic contributions of agriculture in Indiana's congressional districts. The combined effects of agriculture in the state's District 4 (see Figure  3 for reference) produce nearly $2.7 billion in value added and support roughly 33,600 jobs. Both of these estimates rank at the top of Indiana's congressional districts (see Table  8 ). District 8 provides the secondlargest contribution to GDP, while District 3 boasts the second-highest jobs tally. As largely urban districts, Districts 1 and 7 rank near the bottom in both categories, although Source: USDA the manufacturing-heavy nature of agricultural activities in District 7 produces a large employment multiplier effect for that area. The congressional district fact sheets, which begin on page 19, provide an in-depth look at the economic effects of agriculture in each area."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The importance of agriculture to the Indiana economy is clear. The combined effects of agriculture industries support an estimated 188,600 jobs in the state and create $14.9 billion in value added-an amount equal to nearly 5 percent of Indiana's total GDP. Keep in mind that Indiana's farmers and agriculturerelated manufacturers generated these impressive numbers during a tough year plagued by a severe drought. These impacts would likely be higher during a more typical year.\nThe findings in this report demonstrate that efforts to support, or even expand, Indiana's agricultural production and processing can have positive ripple effects throughout the state's economy. This is especially true in regions of the state that are facing declines in other key industries. Therefore, the degree to which agriculture is able to contribute to Indiana's economic growth going forward will be an important economic indicator for the state."}, {"section_title": "Notes", "text": "1.

Data suppression can be common in smaller industries and in smaller counties. For this analysis, IBRC researchers estimated values for any suppressed data cells. The basic estimation approach was to sum the actual reported values for each Indiana county in a given industry and then find the difference, or residual, between that total and the state total in the same industry. The residual was then allocated proportionally to each suppressed county based on these county's output estimates in the corresponding industry in their IMPLAN models for 2012. In some cases, the USDA would publish county rankings for suppressed industries, which the research team could use to determine if the estimates we generated were reasonable, and to make adjustments if not. The estimated data were then controlled to county and state totals.\nFor the analysis of processing and manufacturing industries, the research team relied on the output estimates for each industry in each geographic area found in the 2012 IMPLAN models.

The selection of production industries is straightforward; the research team simply included all industries in sector 11 of the NAICS industry classification scheme with the exception of fishing, hunting and trapping (subsector 114). The NAICS subsectors for production included in this study are crop production, animal production, forestry and logging, and support activities for agriculture and forestry.\nThe selection of processing and manufacturing industries was trickier. There have been several studies similar to this one conducted in other states. Some have used very broad definitions of agriculture that include nearly all types of food, fabric and wood product manufacturing, while others have attempted to focus their analysis on processing industries that are most closely tied to the farm or forest. The IBRC research team selected the latter approach so as not to inflate the impact estimates with industries that have little direct link to Indiana agriculture.\nThe research team used the IMPLAN model to help distinguish which industries it considered primary agricultural processing and manufacturing. The IMPLAN model features production functions for each industry, which are akin to a recipe of the production inputs that each industry needs to produce its output. These production functions also include regional purchase coefficients (RPCs), which are estimates of the share of each production input that is supplied by other Indiana firms.\nThe research team used the RPCs to calculate for each industry the share of production inputs that are sourced from Indiana. A large share of the inputs for Indiana's cheese makers, for instance, come from Indiana-based agriculture production, while only a tiny share of the inputs for local tortilla makers come directly from state agriculture production.\nThe research team settled on a 7 percent threshold, meaning that a processing or manufacturing industry is considered part of agriculture and forestry if at least 7 percent of its production inputs come directly from Hoosier farms or forests. We chose this threshold for two reasons: there was a large break in the values of the ranked list of industries at this point and it began to make intuitive sense to exclude the industries just below this level. Table 9 lists each industry that was included in this analysis along with each industry's total contribution to Indiana output, value added and employment (total effects = direct + indirect + induced effects)."}, {"section_title": "Adjustments to the IMPLAN Model", "text": "As mentioned in the body of the report, the research team adjusted the IMPLAN model to eliminate double counting in the estimates of indirect and induced effects. Without adjustments, the economic activity and employment related agricultural industries would be double counted when these industries supply production inputs to one another. Researchers followed the procedures outlined by the IMPLAN Group to avoid double counting when conducting multi-industry contribution analysis. These adjustment procedures are online at \"MultiIndustry Contribution Analysis\" (https://implan.com/ index.php?option=com_ content&view=article&id=467). Note that there is still some double counting to estimate the federal, state and local government tax flows.\nMultiplier: The multiplier is the magnitude of the economic response in a particular geographic area associated with a change-either an increase or a decrease-in the direct effects. For example, multiply every dollar of agricultural and forestry output by 1.41 to find an estimate of the total contribution of this activity to Indiana's economy. Another way to look at it is that every dollar of output supports $0.41 in additional economic activity in the state.\nOutput: The value of an industry's total production. Output includes both the price of production inputs and the value added of the industry.\nValue Added: Also known as gross domestic product (GDP), value added is the difference between an industry's total output and the cost of its production inputs. Value added consists of four components: employee compensation, proprietor income, other property income and indirect business tax."}, {"section_title": "About IMPLAN Economic Impact Modeling Software", "text": "MIG, Inc. (formerly the Minnesota IMPLAN Group) is the company responsible for developing IMPLAN data and software. Using classic inputoutput (I-O) analysis, IMPLAN can be used to measure the economic effects of an economic event, such as a factory closing or a new plant opening, or the size of the economic footprint of an economic entity like a production facility, headquarters or university."}, {"section_title": "The Economic Theory behind IMPLAN", "text": "IMPLAN is built on a mathematical I-O model that expresses relationships between sectors of the economy in a chosen geographic location. In expressing the flow of dollars through a regional economy, the I-O model assumes fixed relationships between producers and their suppliers based on demand. It also omits any dollars spent outside of the regional economy-say, by producers who import raw goods from another area or by employees who commute and do their household spending elsewhere.\nThe idea behind input-output modeling is that the inter-industry relationships within a region largely determine how that economy will respond to economic changes. In an I-O model, the increase in demand for a certain product or service causes a multiplier effect, layers of effect that come in a chain reaction. Increased demand for a product affects the producer of the product, the producer's employees, the producer's suppliers, the supplier's employees, and so on, ultimately generating a total effect in the economy that is greater than the initial change in demand. Say demand for Andersen Windows' wood window products increases. Sales grow, so Andersen has to hire more people, and the company may buy more from local vendors, and those vendors in turn have to hire more people \u2026 who in turn buy more groceries. The ratio of that overall effect to the initial change is called a regional multiplier and can be expressed like this:\n(Direct Effect + Indirect Effects + Induced Effects) / (Direct Effect) = Multiplier Multipliers are industry and region specific. Each industry has a unique output multiplier, because each industry has a different pattern of purchases from firms inside and outside of the regional economy. (The output multiplier is in turn used to calculate income and employment multipliers.)\nEstimating a multiplier is not the end goal of IMPLAN users. Most wish to estimate other numbers and get the answers to the following questions: How many jobs will this new firm produce? How much will the local economy be affected by this plant closing? What will the effects be of an increase in product demand? Based on those user choices, IMPLAN software constructs \"social accounts\" to measure the flow of dollars from purchasers to producers within the region. The data in those social accounts will set up the precise equations needed to finally answer those questions users haveabout the impact of a new company, a plant closing or greater product demand-and yield the answers.\nIMPLAN constructs its I-O model using aggregated production, employment and trade data from local, regional and national sources, such as the U.S. Census Bureau's annual County Business Patterns report and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' annual report called Covered Employment and Wages. In addition to gathering enormous amounts of data from government sources, the company also estimates some data where they haven't been reported at the level of detail needed (county-level production data, for instance), or where detail is omitted in government reports to protect the confidentiality of individual companies whose data would be easily recognized due to a sparse population of businesses in the area.\nIMPLAN's accessibility and ease of use also make it a target of criticism by some economists, who charge that in the wrong hands, the software-or any input-output model-will produce inflated results at best, and at worst, completely ridiculous projections. Anyone can point and click their way to an outcome without fully understanding the economics in which the tool is grounded and without knowing how to look at data sets with a nuanced eye. The IBRC has two analysts that have attended advanced training in the use of the IMPLAN modeling software. The estimates that the IBRC analysts generate are pressure-tested and triple-checked to ensure that they are accurate and reflect the most trustworthy application of the modeling software. In all instances, the most conservative estimation assumptions and procedures are used to produce the IMPLAN results."}]
