The morphology of barrier islands is influenced by several factors, including: long-term, low energy events, such as waves and tides; short-term, high energy events, such as tropical storms and hurricanes; sediment supply from surrounding fluvial sources; sea level changes and antecedent geology (McBride et al., 1995).

"}, {"section_title": "BACKGROUND", "text": "Galveston Island is a barrier island situated on the southeast Texas Quaternary coastal plain, approximately 80 km southeast of Houston (Giardino et al., 2000). It is part of an almost continuous barrier island chain that runs down the Northwestern coast of the Gulf of Mexico (Giardino et al., 2000). Galveston Island extends over 40 km from the Bolivar Roads mouth of Galveston Bay to San Luis Pass. It began formation during the Holocene low stand over 6,000 years ago as a sand bar (Cole and Anderson, 1982). Overtime the island accreted both seaward and southwestward and formed the modern island. For most of its history, the Galveston barrier island system was prograding seaward, however, over the past 50 years, it has been in a state of retreat, moving landward at an average rate of 3 m/y (Anderson and Smith Wellner, 2002;Siringan and Anderson,1994). The retreat of the island in the early 1900's has been influenced by the several anthropogenic obstructions and physical processes, including: the damming of the Trinity and Brazos rivers, construction of the Galveston seawall and groin system and the dredging of the Houston Ship Channel. These have all altered sediment dispersal patterns and reduced the sediment supply to the island (Hayes, 1967). Sediment supply in this region of the Gulf of Mexico is also influenced by hurricanes. These short term, high energy events impact the Texas shoreline on average every 1.5 years, and a storm that causes substantial erosion to this area occurs about every six years (Siringan and Anderson, 1994). Galveston typically has southeasterly winds in the summer months and short periods of northerly winds in the winter (White et al., 1985). Average significant wave size and tidal range are 2.1 m and 45-50 cm, respectively; however, during hurricanes wind direction changes and wave heights can reach wave height of up to 7 m (Rodriguez et al., 1999). In other coastal settings such as North and South Carolina, it is not only the sediment supply, sea level rise, short and long term events that are the major factors influencing barrier island morphology, but the geological framework as well (Harris et al., 2005;RIGGS et al., 1995). In North Carolina, Riggs et al. showed that the barrier island features were controlled by the Pleistocene, Tertiary and Cretaceous sediments upon which the barrier island system was perched (Riggs, et al., 1995). They divided the system into two distinct regions which controlled various aspects of the modern shoreface. The modern shoreface north of Cape Lookout is composed of a sequence that filled the depositional basin, while the shoreface south of Cape Lookout was composed of antecedent units that crop out along the shelf, with only a thin veneer of modern sediment (Riggs, et al., 1995). The antecedent sequences are cut by an old drainage system (Riggs, et al., 1995). This created fluvial valleys filled with modern sediment which are separated from the antecedent outcropping units (Riggs, et al. 1995). These two distinct regions create nonheadland and headland systems, which influence composition of sediments on the beach, shoreline retreat rates and the morphology of the barrier island (Riggs, et al., 1995). In South Carolina, at Folly and Kiawah Islands, Harris et al. (2005) conducted a study to define the influences of geologic framework on evolution of the coastal zone. They concluded that out of the five geologic regions identified by seismic studies, three units directly influence the barrier island evolution by controlling the stratigraphic highs and lows of the system (Harris et al., 2005). Furthermore, it was stated that the magnitude of influence depends on the depth and competence of the antecedent geologic unit. In the Galveston area several studies have been conducted to establish the basic geology offshore of the region. According to Rodriguez et al. (1999), the geology of the inner shelf of the east Texas coast is composed of three distinct sedimentary facies progressing offshore: the Upper, Proximal Lower and the Distal Lower Shoreface (Figure 2). The Upper Shoreface consists of 80 to 100% fine to very fine sands and extends approximately 1.5 to 2 km offshore (Rodriguez et al., 1999;Siringan and Anderson, 1994;Robb et al., 2003). Surface sediments in this region have a modal size of 3 to 3.25 \u03a6 (Rodriguez et al., 1999) The Proximal Lower Shoreface is composed of very fine sands and medium to thickly interbedded mud layers (10-50 cm), with a silt and clay content ranging from less than 30% to over 60% at the central portions of the island (Rodriguez et al., 1999). The Distal Lower Shoreface contains predominately muddy sediment and thin to medium bedded sand layers (3-20 cm) with 55 to 75% silt and clay content (Rodriguez et al., 1999;Siringan and Anderson, 1994). Sands within the Proximal and Distal Lower Shoreface have a modal size of 2.5 to 3.0 \u03a6. More recently Robb et al., (2003) have identified a fourth geologic facies offshore of Galveston Island; a Modern Mud Unit. The Modern Mud Unit incises antecedent shoreface units and contains at least 60% silt and clay (Robb, et al., 2003;Figure 2). Radioisotope age dating of the Modern Mud Unit was conducted by Robb et al. (2003). Robb used 137 Cs and 210 Pb to establish a geochronology at a study site offshore of the Galveston Island between 25 th and 68 th streets (East End) and offshore of Pirates Beach (West End). The base of the Modern Mud Layer dates to 2660 ybp and the most recent mud layer has formed with in the last 22 and 57 years (Robb et al., 2003). At the base of the modern stratigraphic sequence lies the Pleistocene aged Beaumont Clay (BC) (Siringan and Anderson, 1994). It was formed during the Pleistocene highstand of sea level as clays and silts were deposited from the Trinity and Brazos rivers far from shore. Over time, sea level fell as the Wisconsin Ice age began. During this time, the rivers formed large deltas that cut into the BC unit and extended through our study area and to the southeast (Cole and Anderson, 1982;Blum and Price, 1998). The resulting valley fill and alluvial plain formation provided the sands from which the formation of Galveston Island began (Cole and Anderson, 1982). During the Wisconsinan transgression, sea level rose, the regional sand bodies were transported landward, and Galveston Island began to form. Since the BC has a shear strength of 1 kg/cm 2 , it has a high resistance to erosion, and served as a base upon which the modern island lies. The upper BC boundary is marked by a sharp increase in shear strength and a transition to mottled orange and green clay and the presence of calcareous nodules (Bernard et al., 1959). This Pleistocene sequence lies deeper towards the eastern end of the island near the ancestral incised Trinity River valley and becomes shallower towards the western portion of the island. (White et al., 1985;Bernard et al., 1970). This westward shallowing of the hard, consolidated, indurated BC corresponds with the thickness of overlying sand and mud, resulting in a thinning of the Holocene sediment towards the western end of the Galveston Island. As expected, the amount of sand also decreases with the distance offshore towards the island's sand toe; which, on the western end of the island pinches out at approximately 1.5 km offshore (Robb et al., 2003; Figure   2). The seaward extent of the island toe is also the depth of closure. (Rodriguez, et al., 1999;Swift, et al., 1985). The depth of closure is the depth below the wave base where the waves will actively be stirring the sediment. It is here that there is a change from a sand dominated to mud dominated sediment regime. Consequently, there is also a change in slope at this point, since coarser sediment will form a steeper slope while finer sediment will create a shallower slope. Studies quantifying beach erosion rates on Galveston Island have been conducted by Morton (1985) and more recently by Gibeaut of the Bureau of Economic Geology (2006). Long term beach erosion has occurred on the West End of the island. Rates were up to 4 m/y from just west of the end of the Galveston Seawall to Bermuda Beach (Morton and Paine, 1985;Gibeaut, 2006;Figure 3). Erosion is significantly enhanced after hurricanes, increasing rates to 6 m/y just past the end of the Seawall, several m/y in the middle of the West End near Jamaica Beach and over 6 m/y towards the western most end of the island. (Morton and Paine, 1985).  (Gibeaut, 2006) 3. STUDY AREA The study area is located offshore of Galveston Island, Texas (Figure 4). The site runs the entire length of the island and extends up to 4 km offshore. During the months of March through August 2005 geological and geophysical data including CHIRP seismic sonar, sidescan sonar and multibeam bathymetry data were collected and sediment cores were collected offshore of Galveston Island in the study area. A coring cruise was conducted from July 6-9, 2005 aboard the Lift Boat (L/B) Pontchatrain. Shore-normal transects were planned every 2 km for the entire length of the Galveston Island (Figures 4 and 5). The coring transects were numbered sequentially starting at the eastern end of the island. Cores were collected at depths of 4.5 m, 6.0 m, 7.5 m, 9.0 m and 10.5 m along these transects, and assigned letters A, B, C, D and E, respectively. Due to the presence of geohazards, including: pipelines, archeological and anthropogenic obstructions, several planned locations were unable to be cored. (Dellapenna et al., 2006). The cores collected in this study have been broken down into three sub-regions: East Beach, Jamaica Beach and the West End. From here on the 16 cores collected on transects 3 through 6 will be referred to as the East Beach cores, the 14 cores from transects 8 through 14 will be referred to as the Jamaica Beach cores and the 19 cores collected from transects 16 through 22 will be referred to as the West End Cores. The East Beach cores were collected offshore of the City of Galveston between Stewart Beach and the end of the Seawall. The Jamaica Beach cores were collected between westward of the end of the Seawall to Jamaica Beach. Lastly, the West End cores were collected offshore west of Jamaica Beach to San Luis Pass. In June through August 2005 additional geophysical cruises were conducted in order to collect multibeam bathymetry and sidescan sonar data concurrently offshore of the eastern and central portions of Galveston Island aboard the Louisiana University Marine Consortium's R/V Eugenie.

Following ASTM standards, cores were cut in half lengthwise, photographed, and visual descriptions of the sediment lithology and Munsell color were recorded. One half of each core was archived for future reference and one half processed for water content and grain size analysis. Grain size samples were collected at the beginning and end of each lithologic interval in nine centimeter intervals. A total of 355 samples were processed for grain size analyses. The samples were prepared for analyses by sonicating the sample with deionized water and a calgon solution, then wet sieved through a #230/4 \u03a6 screen into a graduated cylinder. A RO-TAP device containing 11 sieves was used to separate sand samples according to size. Mud content was analyzed using standard pipette methods (Folk, 1965). Upon completion of grain size, RO-TAP and pipette analysis, the respective data were entered into a spreadsheet. The total weight of the samples were calculated and used to determine the percentages of shell, sand, silt and clay in the samples. Data were plotted against depth and grain size and composition profiles were created. Core photographs were assembled using Adobe Photoshop\u00ae and visual descriptions used to create computerized core logs using the LOGPLOT \u00ae software program.

Multibeam data were collected using a pole-mounted Reson-Seabat\u00ae 8101 system.

This program enabled the filtering of spurious data points and allowed for correction of tidal influences on water depth and for variations of the speed of sound in water. (Robb et al., 2003). Tidal data were obtained using the historical MWWL tidal measurements collected hourly at the NOAA tide gauge located at the Galveston Pleasure Pier (2006). After filtering, the multibeam data lines were merged and exported with a resolution of 3m grids. The mosaic was plotted using WGS 1984 datum and UTM 15N Projections in ARCGIS and Fledermaus\u00ae software programs to produce 3-D images of the seabed surface.

Using 512i CHIRP seismic data and sediment core lithology the BC was traced throughout the study area. Data from the 512i CHIRP towfish revealed a strong reflector several meters below the surface of the seafloor. This reflector was traced throughout the CHIRP grid. The intensity of this reflector is created by a significant change in acoustic impedance between these two surfaces. Therefore, this reflector is identified as the BC ravinement surface ( Figure 6). In the CHIRP survey grid, the depth to the BC ranges from 7 to 12 m below sea level ( Figure 7). The surface of the formation shallows progressively westward and shoreward. Its shallowest depth in the CHIRP study area is reached at the northwest corner. To the west of the CHIRP survey, sediment cores collected along transects 18, 20, and 22 show that the BC shallows further and lies 4.4 m below sea level. The thickness of the Holocene marine sediment overlying the BC decreases offshore and towards the west. The Holocene sediment thickness ranges from 2.5 to 6.6 m in the CHIRP survey area (Figure 8). The CHIRP data indicates that the cores taken in this study area were 3 m to less than 1 m shy of penetrating the BC. Further to the west, West End cores indicate further thinning of the modern shoreface, with as little as 65 cm of Holocene sediment overlying the Beaumont surface. Upon visual description and grain size analysis of the sediment cores, several sand and mud units were identified. Along shore-normal transects of 216s CHIRP, seismic data were used in an attempt to correlate these layers along shore. Because CHIRP seismic data are most ideal when collected in muddy sediment, the presence of sand layers makes some of the units difficult to identify and trace. Tracing these units throughout the entire study site was not possible, however general correlations and slope directions were possible. The units consist of gently sloping layers that dip seaward across the study area."}, {"section_title": "East Beach correlations", "text": "In the Line 3, the easternmost transect, five stratigraphic units were identified (Figures 9 and 10). The upper most layer, Layer 1, is composed of fine sand and shell with less than 15% silt and clay and has an average grain size of 3.1 \u03a6. This unit thins and fines offshore, and pinches out between 0.9 and 1.7 km from shore. The Layer 2 is a mud unit which contains less than 45% sand. Layer 3 is a sand layer containing > 75% sand with a mean grain size 3.7 \u03a6. Layer 4 is composed predominately of silt and clay with less than 30% sand. Layer 5 is primarily sand with a mean grain size of 3.0 \u03a6. Layers 2-5 are only observed in core C, the farthest core from shore. In the Line 5 transect seven layers are observed (Figures 11 and 12). Layer 1 is composed of at least 90% sand and shell with a mean grain size of 3.1 \u03a6. This layer thins offshore and pinches out between 0.7 and 1.0 km offshore. Beneath this sand layer lies a mud layer (Layer 2) with less than 50% sand. Layer 3 is composed of sand with a mean grain size of 3.5 \u03a6 and less than 40% silt and clay. Layer 4 is a mud unit with several small interbedded sand layers, with percent sand, silt and clay varying throughout the interval. Layer 5 is composed primarily of sand with less than 15% silt and clay. Layer 6 is a mud unit with very fine sand laminations. Layer 7 is observed to contain less than 7% silt and clay and has a mean grain size of 3.3 \u03a6. Overall, there are several trends observed in the East Beach section. First, there is a thinning to the west and offshore of the upper most sand unit and a decrease in mean grain size offshore. This sand unit pinches out between 0.7 and 1 km offshore in the East Beach study area. Progressing westward the presence of more stratigraphic units observed in the sediment cores and are traceable throughout the transect. Layers typically alternate between sand and mud units, with mud layers becoming thicker and sand layers becoming thinner and finer offshore."}, {"section_title": "Jamaica Beach cores", "text": "Cores collected along transect 12 have been subdivided into five stratigraphic layers (Figures 13 and 14). Layer 1 is composed of sand with a mean grain size of 3.3 \u03a6 and contains less than 8% silt and clay. This unit thins offshore and pinches out between 1 and 2 km offshore. This sand layer is underlain by a mud unit, Layer 2, containing less than 40% sand. Layer 3 is observed to contain sand with less than 15% silt and clay. Layer 4 is composed of mud. Lastly, Layer 5 is observed to be an offshore mud unit onlaping the previous shoreward layers. This unit contains small laminations (less than 10 cm) and varies in percent sand, silt and clay. CHIRP data collected along this transect shows the presence of several reflectors which corresponded to the correlations described above. In the cores along transect 14, four layers are observed (Figures 15,16 and 17). The Layer 1 is composed of fine to very fine sand with mean grain size of 3.4 \u03a6 and less than 5% silt and clay. This unit thins progressively offshore and pinches out between 1.0 and 1.4 km offshore. Layer 2 is identified as a mud unit with sand laminations. It varies in percent sand, silt and clay. Layer 3 is a mud unit which is cut into by the last unit, Layer 5. Layer 5 is an offshore mud unit which cuts into Layers 2 through 4 and a small sand veneer at the surface and several small sand layers throughout. The Jamaica Beach core transects showed several trends. Westward through the study site there is a decrease in the observed number of stratigraphic units. There is also the development of an offshore surface mud unit extends onshore proximal to where the upper sand unit pinches out. Closest to shore this surface mud unit is typically covered by thin veneer of sand. In this study area, the shoreward most point of the mud unit lies between 1 and 2 km offshore of Galveston Island. "}, {"section_title": "West End cores", "text": "In the cores collected along the Line 17 transect, only two stratigraphic units are observed (Figures 18 and 19). The upper most layer (Layer 1) is observed to contain fine grain sand with a mean grain size of 3.2 \u03a6. This layer thins progressively offshore and pinches out between 1.1 and 1.5 km offshore. The second unit is the offshore mud layer which onlaps where the sand unit pinches out. This mud layer contains a thin sand veneer at the surface and several small sand laminations creating variations in percent sand silt and clay. The cores along the Line 18 transect show the BC within 2 m of the sediment surface ( Figures 20 and 21). There were only two identified stratigraphic units in these cores. The first layer is composed of primarily sand with a mean grain size of 3.2 \u03a6 with less than 20% silt and clay and slightly more silt and clay progressing offshore. The bottom of this unit contains a small shell hash layer. This layer thins offshore and is thought to pinch out seaward of the study area. The Layer 2 is the BC. The transition from the sand to the BC is very sharp and there is a change to an orange to green mottled color and a large increase in density. The western-most transect of this study ran along Line 22. The cores along Line 22 showed only two stratigraphic units (Figures 22 and 23). The first is a sand unit with a mean grain size of 3.2 \u03a6 that contained no more than 10% silt and clay. The bottom of this unit contains a shell hash layer. This unit extends though the entire transect to a maximum depth of 1 m. Underlying this sand unit is the BC. This depth of the BC ranges between as shallow as 60 cm and no more than 100 cm below the surface of the seabed throughout this transect. Throughout the West End study section there are several trends that are displayed. There is a decrease in the number of stratigraphic units observed in the cores. The sand layer becomes progressively thinner westward and extends further offshore than the areas to the east. The surface mud layer, is found farther from shore and does not exist in the study area westward of transect 17. The BC shallows to within 65 cm of the seafloor. In addition, there is a small shell hash layer observed just above the interface with the BC. "}, {"section_title": "Galveston Island shoreface", "text": "The Galveston Island shoreface slope varies greatly in the study area. In general, there is a concave up surface with a westward decrease in the slope of the shoreface (Figure 24). When the distance from shore and depth below sea-level of sediment cores is plotted to scale, the slope of the shoreface from the shoreline to the point of inflection is able to be calculated. In transects 3 through 5, located in the East Beach study site, there is a decrease in the slope westward from approximately 9.2 to 6.7 m/km. Progressing westward along the transects from the East Beach area, past the end of the Seawall and to the Jamaica Beach study area there is an increase in the slope to 8.1 m/km at Transect 12, after which the slope again begins to decrease. From transect 12 through the westernmost transect line 22 there is a dramatic decrease in the slope to 4.27 m/km out to approximately 3 km at the most offshore cores. Using multibeam bathymetry plotted in Fledermaus, a more detailed image of the shoreface near the end of the Seawall was produced. A shore-parallel transect at a distance of approximately 0.85 km offshore across the multibeam survey area indicates that there is an increase in the depth to the shoreface approximately 1.5 km west of the end of the Seawall (Figure 25). In addition, the East Beach area is observed to be the deepest and the West End the shallowest, corresponding with results from the core transect slopes.    A final transect is perpendicular to the island just offshore of Jamaica Beach (Figure 29). The average slope is approximately -4.54 m/km until the point of inflection, where the slope decreases. The point of inflection occurs approximately 1.6 km from shore. Westward of this study area the slope of the shoreface continues to decrease, reaching its gentlest slope just before San Luis Pass at the western-most end of the Island. The corresponding point of inflection is the farthest from shore. The sidescan mosaic collected with the multibeam bathymetry revealed a tripartite zonation of surface sediment similar to Robb et al., (2003;Figure 30). Close to shore the seafloor is composed of at least 90% sand and shell. The surface sand layer pinches out at the point of inflection, where the slope of the shoreface begins to decrease ( Figure 31). Progressing seaward past the point at which the upper sand layer pinches out is a zone of mixed backscatter. Core data reveals in this transition zone which contains mixed backscatter, the landward portion of the mud facies begins to develop and in some areas area covered by a thin veneer of surface sand. Further offshore, there is a region of mud at the surface. The interpretations of the antecedent controls of shoreface agree with the research of Harris et al. (2005). Harris states that the \"The magnitude to which the antecedent statigraphic variability will influence the shoreface profile depends upon the attitude and competence of the underlying strata, the depth in the subsurface strata\u2026\" Since the BC is a highly consolidated clay, it has a great affect on the shoreface as it shallows and becomes closer to the sediment surface. The eastern end of Galveston Island (East Beach) formed directly above the old incised Trinity River valley (Siringan and Anderson, 1994;Rodriguez et al., 1999) where the thickest sand unit was deposited above the BC. The BC in this area lies over 15 m below sea level (White et al., 1985), which provided accommodation space for this sand to accumulate during initial island formation. The South Jetty has caused a significant accretion of sand along East Beach, further thickening the sand layer. The accretion of sand is due to the decrease in longshore transport created by the South Jetty and Seawall system. This agrees with the model created by Toue and Wang (1990) which shows accretion on the updrift side of seawall systems. In this region, the sediment cores verified the continuity of the sand unit, indicating the absence of any mud layers. The slope of the shoreface in this area is steeper than in other regions of the island because of the depth to the BC (Figure 32), which provides accommodation space for the accretion of sand. The accretion of sand here creates a wider and thicker coarse sediment regime of 3.1 \u03a6 (up to 28% coarser than other core transects) to approximately 1 km offshore. Therefore, this coarser grain size regime creates a steeper shoreface slope of approximately 7.2 m/km (about 23% steeper than the 8-Mile Road transect). This steeper shoreface profile shifts the break in slope closer to shore ( Figure 32). In this region the shoreface profile also corresponds to the depth of closure, and the toe of the Upper Shoreface (Rodriguez, et al., 1999, Swift et al. 1985. Proximal to this location, the sediment type normally changes from sand to mud dominated, however this is not the case in the East Beach area. Due to the accretion caused by the South Jetty, the profile is locally out of equilibrium and the transition from sand to mud is not observed at this point. Similar to that of Harris et al. (2005), since the BC lies deeper in this region, it will have less of an influencing factor here. The main control of the shoreface in this area is the anthropogenic influences of the South Jetty and Seawall system ( Figure 32). West of East Beach, the accretion caused by the South Jetty decreases and there is an increase in the number of sand and mud layers, filling the available accommodation space and resulting in the shallowing of the shoreface slope. The shallowing of the shoreface also resulted in the offshore migration of the shoreface inflection point. Line 6 is the easternmost transect in which the presence of the modern mud layer is observed in the study area. The shallowing of the shoreface slope also corresponds to shallowing of the BC to depths between 9 m (approximately 0.5 km from shore) and 12 m below sea level (approximately 4 km from shore). Similar to the East Beach region, the main influencing factor of the shoreface offshore of the City of Galveston is the anthropogenic influences of the Seawall, Groin and Jetty system ( Figure 32). The shallowing of the slope continues to decrease westward until the end of the Seawall is reached. At the end of the Seawall, there is a sharp increase in the slope of the shoreface. In addition there is a decrease in the number of observed sand and mud layers in the sediment cores which indicates enhanced erosion. The area with the steepest shoreface slope is located directly offshore of 8-Mile Road, approximately 1 km west of the end of the Seawall (Figure 32). This abrupt change in slope is an indication that the shoreface is locally out of equilibrium, varying from the regional trend of the slope. 8-Mile Road is also where historically the most shoreline erosion has taken place (Morton and Paine, 1985;Gibeaut, 2006;Figure 33). Erosion in this location results from the abrupt ending of the hardened Seawall similar to that predicted by the model of seawall systems created by Toue and Wang (1990). The Seawall and its associated groin system locally disrupt the natural sediment transport patterns in the region. The groins block the transport of sand down-drift (to the west). Although sediment supply to this area has been significantly reduced, the longshore transport continues to remove sand from this area westward, creating a sediment deficiency and a significant localized erosional hotspot. As a result of this enhanced erosion, westward of 8-Mile Road, across the Jamaica Beach Study area, the sediment supply has locally increased. In addition, the BC shallows to depths between 7 m (approximately 0.5 km from shore) and 12 km (approximately 4 km from shore) below sea level. This local change in sediment supply and BC depth corresponds with a decrease in the slope of the shoreface and in the number observed lithologic layers in the sediment cores. This decrease in the slope of the shoreface, indicates the shoreface is returning to the regional trend and agrees with observations of shoreline erosion made by Morton and Paine (1985). They state that this segment of the segment of the island is relatively stable, due to increased sediment supply. This decrease in the slope of the shoreface in this area causes the modern mud layer to be located farther seaward, as is the shoreface inflection point, extending the modern island toe to approximately 1 to 2 km offshore. At approximately 2.5 km east of the community of Sea Isle and 17.5 km west of the end of the Seawall, the BC reaches a depth of 7.7 m below sea level at approximately 1.5 km from shore and 10.2 m below sea level at 1.8 km from shore. Sediment cores collected in this area show that there is less than 1 m of Holocene sand overlying the BC. There is a corresponding decrease in the slope and an offshore migration of the island toe and modern mud layer seaward of the study area. In this area the depth of the BC is the main control of the shoreface topography ( Figure 32). At the westernmost end of Galveston Island, near San Luis Pass, the depth to the BC shallows even further to 4.4 m below sea level approximately 0.7 km from shore and 8m below sea level approximately 1.7 km from shore. In this area there is only approximately 0.6 m of sand overlying the BC. This area has the flattest slope of the island and the shoreface toe is furthest from shore. In this area since the BC is so close to the sediment surface it is the main control of the shoreface. This agrees with Majzlik (2005) which argued that the BC was a main control of the shoreface at Matagorda Island, when the BC was at similar depths below the sediment surface."}, {"section_title": "Geology of offshore Galveston Island", "text": "The modern strata composing of the shoreface of Galveston Island consists of four major stratigraphic facies progressing offshore, these units are: the Upper Shoreface, Proximal Lower Shoreface, Distal Lower Shoreface and Modern Transgressive Mud Layer (Rodriguez et al., 1999;Robb et al., 2003). Each successive facies contains layers with increasing proportions of silt and clay, and consequently a decrease in the mean grain size. Sediment cores and CHIRP seismic data in this study indicate that the alternating sand and mud units can be traced through the study area. Therefore, a clear boundary between the Proximal and Distal Lower Shoreface is indistinguishable. For the purposes of this study, the Proximal Lower Shoreface and Distal Lower Shoreface facies have been combined since there is evidence that these sand and mud layers may be traceable across the facies boundaries (Table 1, Figures 33 and 34). Observations from this study found that the upper shoreface (modern island sand) consists of a continuous unit of 80 to 100% fine to very fine sands with patches of shellhash and is consistent with that of Rodriguez et al. (1999). The mean grain size of sediment in this facies ranges from 3.1 to 3.4 \u03a6, decreasing offshore. Surface sediments in this region have a modal size of 3 to 3.25 \u03a6 (Rodriguez et al., 1999). Thickness of this unit ranges from 9 m by Bolivar Roads at the east end of the island (Siringan and Anderson, 1994) to 0.6 m by San Luis Pass at the western end of the island. This upper sand unit also thins offshore pinching out between 0.7 to over 2 km offshore at the east end and west end, respectively.  Previous research has found that the Proximal Lower Shoreface is composed of very fine sands and medium to thickly interbedded mud layers (10-50 cm) (Rodriguez et al., 1999). This facies has a silt and clay content ranging from less than 30% to over 60% at the central portions of the island (Rodriguez et al., 1999). The Distal Lower Shoreface has been shown to contain predominately muddy sediment and thin to medium bedded sand layers (3-20 cm) with 55 to 75% silt and clay content (Rodriguez et al., 1999;Siringan and Anderson, 1994). Sands within the Proximal and Distal Lower Shoreface have a modal size of 2.5 to 3.0 \u03a6. Sediment core analysis from this study revealed that the combined unit, the Lower Shoreface, may be missing from the eastern end of the island. It emerges in the study area offshore of around 53 rd Street. The Lower Shoreface underlies the Upper Shoreface and extends offshore past the toe of the island sand unit. Westward from 53 rd Street, the Lower Shoreface is located further offshore and by transect 17 located between Jamaica Beach and Sea Isle, has shifted at least 2 km offshore and is not observed in the study area. The major distinguishing factor between this study and previous studies is that sediment core and CHIRP seismic data indicates that the interbedded sand and mud layers can be traced through the facies. Core data indicates the presence of alternating sand and mud layers. Layer thickness varies, but there is a correlation between layer thickness and distance from shore. Closer to shore sand layers dominate, with thin mud layering. Offshore sand layers thin and mud layers increase in thickness. This results from varying wave climate offshore, which permits more settling of mud further from shore. There is also a correlation between the number of alternating sand and mud units and the thickness of the Holocene marine sequence. With the exception of the eastern most portion of the island, which lies above the Trinity River valley fill and has been accreting due to the presence of the South Jetty, the number and net thickness of sand and mud layers and decrease westward as the Holocene sequences thins. The modern mud unit incises antecedent shoreface units and contains at least 60% silt and clay, with a few thin sand laminations, agreeing with the study conducted by Robb et al. (2003). The mud facies emerges after the upper shoreface sand layer has pinched out, beneath the depth of closure and becomes progressively thicker offshore. At the eastern end of Galveston Island, the modern mud layer is either located outside of the study area or is missing due to the accretion of East Beach. Westward, the modern mud layer is located closer to shore and reaches its shoreward most point near 8-Mile road, where it is approximately less than 1km from shore. Westward, the modern mud unit is found further offshore and out of the study area. According to Robb et al. (2003), the base of the modern mud layer dates to 2660 ybp and the most recent mud layer has formed with in the last 22 to 57 years (Robb et al., 2003). Robb et al. (2003) suggests that the formation of the recently accumulated portion of the modern mud layer was formed due to longshore currents acting upon dredge spoil placed seaward of the inlet jetties of Bolivar Roads. Considering the broad extent of this layer, it appears more likely that the upper portion of the modern mud layer is a sequence of physically mixed sediment from recent storm layers."}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY", "text": "Galveston Island is one of the nations most highly eroding shorelines. This has caused increased concern with local residents and government officials, and has also spurred the development of beach management programs in the region. In response to these concerns, a study was conducted in the spring and summer of 2005. Its goal was to delineate the antecedent and anthropogenic controls of the shoreface architecture and to reevaluate the geology of the shoreface in order to better understand the processes that affect Galveston Island. Sidescan sonar, CHIRP seismic, and Multibeam bathymetry data were acquired and sediment cores were collected for the entire length of the island. The shoreface architecture offshore of Galveston Island is influenced both by antecedent geology and the anthropogenic structures in the region. The Beaumont Clay is a hard, consolidated, indurated clay unit which underlies Galveston Island, and much of southeast Texas. Upon formation of Galveston Island, the BC provided a basement geologic framework upon which Holocene sediments were deposited. Sediment gradually built out southwestward and seaward forming the modern island. The greatest affects of the BC is seen offshore of the western half of the island as the BC shallows reaching a depth of 4 m below sea level. Where the BC is near the surface, the accommodation space for sediment to be stored on the shelf is limited, and results in the overall thinning of the Holocene marine sequence. There is a thinning of the Upper Shoreface, and less layers observed in the Lower Shoreface in places where the BC is thickest and the surface of the BC is topographically highest. The depth to the BC also influences the shoreface profile, causing it to shallow as the BC reaches the surface. The greatest affects of the BC is seen offshore of the western half of the island where the The anthropogenic structures created by the United States Army Corps of Engineers to help stabilize the island after the 1900 hurricane, including the Seawall and associated groin system, have altered the sediment transport patterns of the island drastically, by blocking most of the down-drift transport of sand past the groins. The affects of the anthropogenic structures have the greatest influence on the shoreface offshore of the eastern half of Galveston Island. The South Jetty has caused a large volume of sand to accrete offshore of East Beach. The accumulation of this sand has caused the burying of sand and mud layers proximal to East Beach and causes a steeping of the shoreface profile due to the presence of sand coarser than the regional trend. At the end of the seawall there has been massive historical erosion observed over the last 60 years (Gibeaut 2006, Morton andPaine, 1985). This erosion occurs because the seawall and groin system is starving the natural West End of the island and trapping sand between the groins. Since long-shore transport continues though sand supply has decreased, more sand is transported from the area than is accreted. This causes the profile to be out of equilibrium and creates a steeper shoreface profile approximately 2 km west of the end of the seawall. The geology offshore of Galveston Island generally agrees with Rodriguez et al. (1999), Robb et al. (2003), Siringan and Anderson (1994). The shoreface is divided into three distinct sedimentary facies, the Upper Shoreface, Lower Shoreface and the Modern Mud Unit. The Upper Shoreface is composed primarily of fine to very fine sand. This unit is thicker and pinches out closer to shore on the east end of the island and is thinner and pinches out further from shore on the west end of the island. The Lower Shoreface is composed of continuous alternating sand and mud layers with the sand layers generally thinning offshore and the mud layers thickening. The Lower Shoreface seems to be missing or located offshore of the study area at the east and west ends of the island. The Modern Mud Unit is composed of primarily silt and clay and forms seaward of the point of inflection of the slope and where the Island sand unit pinches out. Overall, we have observed that the shoreface is greatly influenced by antecedent geology as well as anthropogenic structures in the area. They affect the slope of the shoreface, accommodation space for sediment and the location and distribution of the three observed sediment facies. This information furthers the current understanding of the shoreface dynamics of Galveston Island and will benefit future beach management programs and studies.
