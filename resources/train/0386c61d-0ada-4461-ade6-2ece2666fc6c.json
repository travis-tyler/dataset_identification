[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides high resolution brain morphological information and is used as a biomarker in neurodegenerative diseases. Population studies of brain morphology often seek to identify pathological structural changes related to different diagnostic categories (e.g.: controls, mild cognitive impairment or dementia) which normally describe highly heterogeneous groups with a single categorical variable. Instead, multiple biomarkers are used as a proxy for pathology and are more powerful in capturing structural variability. Hence, using the joint modeling of brain morphology and biomarkers, we aim at describing structural changes related to any brain condition by means of few underlying processes. In this regard, we use a multivariate approach based on Projection to Latent Structures in its regression variant (PLSR) to study structural changes related to aging and AD pathology. MRI volumetric and cortical thickness measurements are used for brain morphology and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (t-tau, p-tau and amyloid-beta) are used as a proxy for AD pathology. By relating both sets of measurements, PLSR finds a low-dimensional latent space describing AD pathological effects on brain structure. The proposed framework allows us to separately model aging Manuscript effects on brain morphology as a confounder variable orthogonal to the pathological effect. The predictive power of the associated latent spaces (i.e., the capacity of predicting biomarker values) is assessed in a cross-validation framework."}, {"section_title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "text": "H UMAN brains are constantly evolving throughout life, changing their neurobiological structure according to an uncountable number of factors ranging from genetics or hormonal to vascular factors [1] . Hence, we can define multiple interdependent processes occurring at the same time in each subject's brain. A normal aging process describes similar changes in groups of subjects with similar age and can be characterized by subject's real age. Often, in elderly subjects, other processes related to dementia occur in parallel and eventually result in cognitive or memory decline. The etiology of those processes is still unknown but a large literature of promising research is being published, specially for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia. The work in [2] goes through several examples of recent findings commenting the found evidences. In that sense, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, as a proxy measure of pathophysiological (A\u03b2 and tau deposition) processes, show an acceptable sensitivity and specificity for AD diagnostic purposes and can be used as a measure of disease progression along the AD continuum [3] . This led to the definition of the preclinical (PC) stage of AD, where subjects present abnormal levels of A\u03b2 in the brain without cognitive decline or clinical symptoms [4] . More recently, an alternative approach defining AD as a biological continuum rather than a syndrome has been proposed [5] . In this line, promising developments in PET imaging could provide us with more sensitive and specific pathological biomarkers [6] . On the other hand, high-field MR imaging provide detailed brain anatomical information as a measure of brain structure that can be used to study neurodegenerative processes associated with brain development and aging [7] , cognitive decline [8] , [9] and amyloid positivity [10] . The inter-relationship between AD pathological markers, neurodegeneration and cognition is highly studied in the literature [11] , [12] . However, CSF and PET are costly and/or invasive biomarkers while structural MRI is a cheap and non-invasive biomarker of neurodegeneration. Hence, the overall goal of this work is to predict CSF biomarkers using MRI features and study their relationship. To this end, we consider two separate processes governing brain morphology along the AD continuum: aging and AD, measured through age and CSF biomarkers, respectively. We acknowledge the presence of other processes (e.g: non-AD pathologies) specially in later stages of the disease, but these analyses are out of the scope of this work. Structural brain changes are heterogeneous among subjects [13] and may not be uniform across the brain, specially if related to dementia. However, we hypothesize that these changes can be described by a small set of interdependent underlying processes that define common morphological patterns across all subjects. We build two different latent models to find specific effects due to brain aging and AD and couple them in a single brain structure model. Moreover, we constrain both models to be orthogonal to each other in order to disentangle aging from disease processes on brain morphology. We investigate and compare two different modeling approaches of AD effects: single model for the whole AD continuum modeling accounting for linear effects or separate models for each stage accounting for stage-wise linear effects. Projection to Latent Structures (also known as Partial Least Squares) is used in its regression form (PLSR) to jointly model the variation of MRI measurements as predictor variables and age and CSF biomarkers as response variables. Finally, we use the learned patterns for predicting age and AD pathological markers.\nRelated work: PLS modelling in any of its variants has been widely used in neuroimaging studies and a good review of several applications in the field can be found in [14] . As an example, PLS is used in [15] to jointly model the variation of genotype and phenotype in Alzheimer's disease, using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and 5 regional brain volumes as measurements. A white matter integrity analysis through diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is analyzed in [16] , where several diffusion parameters (axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD) and fractional anisotropy (FA)) are used to study differences in white matter between different AD stages. In [17] , underlying brain morphometric patterns are used to predict subjects that convert from mild cognitive impaired (MCI) to AD-dementia with high predictive power. Similar to our work, the goal in [18] is to find latent spaces related to aging and disease processes using PLS to model the variability of brain shape features with age and clinical scores. Here, they jointly model aging and AD effects using age and the mini mental score examination (MMSE) cognitive test, respectively. In a cross-sectional analysis, they find overlap between aging and AD processes while using longitudinal data disentangles both effects. Other multivariate methods used for diagnosis classification using a wide range of imaging modalities are described in [19] . However, clinical scores or cognitive profiles (i.e MMSE) are better suited to assess dementia as a syndrome rather than to characterize the full spectrum of AD. In that sense, CSF biomarkers are widely used as a proxy fo AD pathology [20] . Prediction of amyloid-positive subjects using MRI-based multivariate methods is an increasing area of research [10] , [21] due to its potential applications in clinical screening. Studies relating CSF biomarkers and MRI measurements in the literature mostly use standard hypothesis testing and linear regression techniques. A comparison between CSF and MRI discriminative and predictive power can be found in [22] and [23] , respectively. In the first, cross-sectional MRI and CSF measurements are used to predict different clinical groups along the disease continuum, while in the second they are used as baseline measurements to predict future clinical change measured through Clinical Dementia Rating-sum of boxes (CDR-SB) and MMSE. Both works show that MRI outperforms CSF but they show complementary information, providing a boost in performance when using both for classification and prediction. Finally, the work in [24] independently relates each CSF measure with brain ROIs using the General Linear Model and hypothesis testing showing moderate relationships between baseline CSF measurements and longitudinal atrophy rates in many brain structures."}, {"section_title": "II. METHODS", "text": "In this work, we aim at predicting pathological markers (i.e: CSF biomarkers) using brain morphological (i.e. MRI) features. Our modeling assumptions is that there coexist two main process in the brain (brain aging and AD processes) that can be described by means of few underlying structures related to brain morphometry. These latent patterns are further used to predict AD pathological markers. For this purpose, we use Partial Least Squares regression (PLSR) methodology [25] ."}, {"section_title": "A. PLSR: Partial Least Squares Regression", "text": "In general, Partial Least Squares (PLS) is a statistical model that analyzes the joint variability between two sets of measurements, (X and Y ) on the same observations. Its main goal is to find latent structures related to both input measurements whose covariance is maximized. In the same line, the PLSR approach aims at predicting one set of measurements, Y from the other X by means of common latent structures that maximize the joint variability among them. Formally, PLSR finds two sets of weight vectors (w, c) that jointly decompose the predictor matrix X \u2208 R N \u00d7K and the response matrix Y \u2208 R N \u00d7M into latent variables (t, u) by maximizing the covariance of the latent spaces. Here, N stands for the number of observations, while K and M define the number of predictors and response variables, respectively.\nFor a single latent dimension (L = 1) PLSR finds the underlying representations as linear combinations of input measure-\nSolving Eq. (1) using Lagrange multipliers, weight vectors have the following analytic expression:\nFor a latent space of dimension L > 1, each subsequent latent factor is computed by iterating over the same optimization process (i.e. Eq.(1), (2)) and concatenating the results\n. However, at each iteration, PLS uses deflated versions of input measurements (X and Y) as new predictors and response variables, forcing successive latent directions to be orthogonal to previous ones and hence, maximizing the input variance explained. The deflated version of X and Y at ith-iteration is:\nwith i = 0, . . . , L \u2212 2, X 0 = X and Y 0 = Y Due to continuous deflation of input spaces, weight matrices (W, C) do not directly relate input (X, Y ) and latent (T, U ) spaces. Accounting for that, rotation matrices, R x , R y , are defined:\nwhere E models the regression error."}, {"section_title": "B. PLSR Orthogonalization and Coupling", "text": "A common assumption in neuroimaging studies is that the object of study (e.g: brain morphology) is affected at the same time by the condition of interest (e.g: AD) and confounding variables (e.g: age, genetics). The standard solution is to regress-out the unwanted factors on the condition of interest. In a PLSR framework, it can be done estimating two separate models for confounders (M C ) and the variable of interest (M I ) and imposing orthogonality between models. Similarly to the work in [16] , we introduce the orthogonality constraint in the optimization process forcing the associated latent subspace (T C , T I ) to be orthogonal. The M C model using X, Y C as predictor and response variables, respectively, is found by solving the regular expression in Eq. (1) for an L C -dimensional subspace with weights w C i for i = 0 : L C \u2212 1. To account for the variance explained by confounding variables, we subtract the measurement variance explained by M C in the predictor variable of M I , resulting in a deflated version of the input measurement X = X \u2212 T C P C . Hence, the optimization process for M I model using Y i as response variables is as follows:\nwhere r C i are the columns of the PLSR rotation matrix R C of model M C . For an L I -dimensional subspace the resulting weights can be expressed as:\nwhere X j and Y I j are the deflated version of X 0 and Y I 0 at jth iteration. Finally, the full PLSR model (M f ull , L f ulldimensional) is built by concatenating latent scores and rotation matrices from both models:\nWe define two separate models for brain aging and AD effects (M C = M aging , M I = M AD ). We first estimate M aging model using normal aging subjects and brain volumetric features as predictor and age as response variable. Thereafter, we use the methodology state in Section II-B to fit the M AD model using subjects in the AD pathophysiological path and a deflated version of brain volumetric features as predictor and CSF biomarkers (A\u03b2, p-tau, t-tau) as response variables.

The goal is to find latent patterns that are relevant for brain condition variables (s). The null hypothesis states that there is no correlation between lth latent factor of the model and response variable s and is estimated by breaking the initial relationship between brain morphology (X) and CSF biomarkers (Y). It can be done by permuting subject indices on Y measurements and using this new dataset (X, Y perm ) to fit a PLSR model. The resulting latent space is used to compute the effect strength for each AD biomarker and age.

EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. Data", "text": "In our experiments we use the publicly available dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. 1 We build a sample of N = 802 subjects split into diagnostic categories following recently published guidelines [27] : N H C = 189 healthy controls (HC), N P C = 136 preclinical (PC) subjects, N M C I = 330 subjects labeled as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and N AD \u2212dem entia = 147 subjects diagnosed with dementia due to AD. MCI and AD-dementia subjects are diagnosed following the standard criteria used in ADNI and reported in [28] while for PC subjects we select asymptomatic subjects with positive amyloid-beta using the extensively used threshold at A\u03b2 < 192 pg/mL [29] . All subjects have a T1-weighted MRI available, preprocessed using FreeSurfer 2 and segmented according to [30] and [31] into regions of interest (ROIs). Grey matter volume divided by the total intracranial volume and cortical thickness averages are computed for each ROI and used as predictor variables (X). Age and CSF biomarkers (A\u03b2, p-tau, t-tau) are used as response variables (Y). Together with age and CSF biomarkers, a normalized CSF index as diagnostic metric for disease progression (AD-CSF, [3] ) is also used for the analysis of AD pathological effects on the latent model. The AD-CSF index is a combination of CSF biomarkers and has two different forms: i) AD-CSF1 that involves p-tau protein and A\u03b2 and ii) AD-CSF2 that involves t-tau and A\u03b2.\nWe use the linear regression model in Eq. 5 to define the dimension of each latent space, L, by evaluating the total mean absolute error (MAE) of the predicted response variables in a 5-fold cross-validation framework [32] . To model brain aging, we use only HC subjects and set L aging = 2 while for modeling brain AD we investigate two a priori hypothesis: i) latent patterns (effect-type) governing AD pathology are linear across all continuum with possibly different effect strengths at different stages and ii) latent patterns governing AD pathology are stagewise linear across the continuum. For the first case, we model brain AD with L AD = 4 using PC, MCI and AD-dementia subjects together in one single model, while for the second case we model brain AD separately at each stage resulting in 4 different models for NC, PC, MCI and AD-dementia subjects (L AD = 4dimensional model for each stage). The overall latent space in both cases is built by concatenating latent factors from the brain aging model (t 0 , t 1 ) and from AD model (t 2 , t 3 , t 4 , t 5 ). To refer to subspaces found using volumetric or cortical thickness data we use t V i and t C T i , respectively. We investigate the effect strength of each latent dimension with age and AD pathological markers and assess their relevance using permutation testing with N perm = 1000 permutations and an uncorrected threshold of p < 0.05. The associated brain morphometric patterns for aging and AD processes are shown and compared with the literature. Finally, we show the predictive power of each model using a 5-fold cross-validation framework to report the mean absolute error (MAE) of each variable of interest."}, {"section_title": "B.

The effect strength of brain condition markers on each latent factor (\u03c1 l(s) ) is shown in Figure 1 and listed in Tables V, VI (Appendix B) with the associated p-values for models using volumetric and cortical thickness features, respectively.\nTo better understand the model of each measurement (volumetric and cortical thickness), we first analyze the effect strength related to the variables of interest at each latent dimension \u03c1 l(s) . In Figure 1 we show the absolute value of the correlation between each latent variable t l and the respective indicators s = age, CSF biomarkers and the two AD-CSF indices evaluated separately on subjects at specific AD stages (HC, PC, MCI, AD-dementia).\nEach effect type can be seen as a morphological pattern responding to certain conditions. According to the results in Tables V, VI (Appendix B) we can distinguish three different types of relevant (p < 0.05) patterns along the AD continuum: i) age-related patterns associated with high correlation with age, ii) AD-related patterns that present high correlation with AD markers and iii) mixed age and AD-related patterns that show high correlation values with age and several indicators of AD progression. The first one is found relevant on normal aging subjects, while the other two coexist along the AD continuum, meaning that aging and AD processes might partially overlap across the brain. We show an example of each type of pattern for volumetric features in Figure 2 and for cortical thickness features in Figure 3 , in line with the corresponding effect strengths at each stage.\nIn Figure 2 (a) we show an age related pattern with high effect strength at pre-dementia stages (HC, PC and MCI) but low effect strength at AD-dementia stage. This pattern is estimated using only HC subjects and M aging model and shows whole brain atrophy except for the choroid plexus regions. An AD-related pattern (t 2 ) is depicted in Figure 2(b) showing high correlation with AD pathological markers both on subjects along the whole AD continuum and independently at all stages. It shows a highly symmetric pattern were positive and negative values indicate neurodegeneration and increased ROI volume, respectively, due to its positive correlation with CSF-A\u03b2 and negative correlation with CSF-ptau and CSF-ttau values. Cortical regions (parahippocamapus, middle temporal, transverse temporal, inferior temporal) and subcortical regions (hippocampus, amygdala and fusiform) of the temporal lobe as well as regions such as the choroid plexus and, specially, the entorhinal cortex are the most affected regions positively correlated with t 2 , indicating neurodegeneration over the course of AD. Other regions such as the precentral or the pars orbitalis are negatively correlated with t 2 . Finally, a mixed age and AD-related pattern (t 3 ) is shown in Figure 2c , which is negatively correlated with age and positively correlated with CSF-ptau, CSF-ttau and their associated indices along the AD continuum and independently at each stage while it remains independent of CSF-A\u03b2 values. Among the regions driving this pattern, we found choroid plexus, precuneus (negatively correlated with t 3 ), temporal pole and parahippocampus (positively correlated with t 3 ) the most relevant ones, indicating that they are involved in both brain aging and brain AD processes.\nSimilarly, patterns associated with cortical thickness are shown in Figure 3 and are also split into age-related, AD-related and mixed age and AD-related effects. Firstly, Figure 3 (a) presents an age-related pattern involving overall cortical reduction with age in the normal aging model M aging except for the cingulate regions that show increased thickness. Secondly, an AD-related pattern is depicted in Figure 3(b) , involving cortical shrinkage of temporal regions (superior, middle, inferior) and the entorhinal cortex and increased thickness at regions such as precentral or transverse temporal. Finally, an age-AD mixed related pattern with opposite relationship between age (-) and CSF p-tau/t-tau (+) is shown in Figure 3c . It is associated with cortical shrinkage of parietal lobe regions and precuneus and increased thickness on parahippocampus, precentral, pars orbitalis, insula and superior temporal on the left hemisphere. Overall, similar findings are found for cortical thickness and volumetric data. Finally, we evaluate the predictive power of the latent factors found for both age and CSF biomarkers at different disease stages. For better comparison, all indicators are globally standardized using z-score on all subjects (i.e. mean centered and normalized by variance). Table I shows the mean absolute error (MAE) for each class using cortical thickness and volumetric features and can be interpreted as the fraction of error per standard deviation. These results can be compared with standard linear regression method found in Tables III, IV  (Appendix A) .\nAge is best predicted using HC subjects and it increases with later stages at the AD continuum, showing that features affected by age are also affected by the disease. CSF A\u03b2 biomarker presents lower predictive error at AD continuum stages and high predictive error at HC stage probably due to the standardization process, where it presents low variance at AD continuum stages and higher variance at HC stage. CSF p-tau/t-tau seem not very predictable using brain morphometry measurements. Compared to standard linear regression, we found no clear gain of our methodology for the regression task. Hence, even though encountered patterns are highly related with certain conditions, they are not predictive of AD markers."}, {"section_title": "C. Multiple Models for AD Pathology", "text": "Under the assumption that underlying processes governing brain structure along the AD continuum might differ between stages, we fit a brain AD model independently for each stage including i) HC, ii) PC, iii) MCI and iv) AD-dementia.

A complete list of all effects strengths with their associated p-values is listed in Tables VII, VIII (Appendix B).\nUnderlying patterns from the brain aging model remain the same while latent factors related to brain AD model increase their effect strength and statistical relevance at each stage. More specific patterns of brain AD are found for each AD stage. Here, we focus on AD-related latent factors found in previous section (Section III-B) to discover differences between brain morphological patterns related to AD at specific stages. Hence, in Figure 5 and Figure 6 we show the effect-type of the third latent dimension using volumetric (t V 2 ) and cortical thickness features "}, {"section_title": "(t C T", "text": "2 ), respectively. Both figures show the highest correlation with AD pathological markers.\nHere, we concretely study the third dimension of the model (t 2 ), an AD-related process that presents the highest correlation with AD pathological markers with both cortical thickness and volumetric features. In Figure 5 we present the underlying pattern found at each stage of the disease using volumetric features. Compared to the effect type found in previous analysis (Figure 2(b) ), the effect type on MCI and ADdementia stages appears to be very similar with the addition of the pallidum showing compensatory effect in the later. On the other hand, in the PC stage slightly differs from the global AD pattern yielding an specific preclinical signature. The neurodegeneration pattern involve choroid plexus and pallidum while pericalcarine show increased mean ROI volume. Again, similar results are found addressing volumetric and cortical thickness features.\nFor predictive analysis, all indicators are globally standardized using z-score on all subjects (i.e. mean centered and normalized by variance). In Table II we summarize the mean absolute error (MAE) per class that can be interpreted as the fraction of error per standard deviation. Even though stage-wise modeling provides a higher effect strength and more relevant brain AD patterns, the predictive power of CSF biomarkers is slightly worse for late stages of the AD continuum, probably indicating a lower generalization power of the brain features found for the same number of latent dimensions. Nonetheless, PLSR has higher predictive power than the standard linear regression using raw morphometric features (Table IV from  Appendix A) ."}, {"section_title": "IV. DISCUSSION", "text": "In this work we aim at predicting AD pathological markers from brain morphology in elderly adults. To this end, we disentangle aging and pathological processes by orthogonal projections in a lower-dimensional subspace describing brain morphology along the disease continuum. We provide two different approaches to model the AD continuum: linear and stage-wise linear models, assuming in the later that brain anatomy might differ between AD stages. Statistical significance and predictability capacity of each model is assessed using either grey-matter volume or cortical thickness measurements as brain morphological features. Joint modeling of both types of features do not reveal further insights since the overall effect and predictive power remain similar indicating that they might not provide sufficient complementary information.\nBoth linear and stage-wise linear models find relevant patterns related to age, AD and a mixture of both, meaning that aging and disease processes might overlap. Using a single model for the whole AD continuum finds common structures that are affected over the course of the disease, delineating the AD signature supported in the literature [33] . On the other hand, fitting a model to each disease stage allows to find temporally specific patterns and increase the effect strength of AD pathological markers at each stage. While a single model finds relevant patterns involving typical AD-related regions in the temporal lobe, using separate stage-wise linear models allows to uncover significant structures at specific stages. Using multiple models we could fit a separate model for each stage along the AD continuum increasing the correlation between descriptive brain morphological patterns and AD pathological markers. In detail, we found that brain structure at MCI and AD-dementia stages reveal morphological patterns overlapping with the previously found AD signature. However, at preclinical (PC) stage the joint variability of CSF biomarkers and brain structure follows a different and more specific pattern and thus, motivates the separate study of a preclinical AD signature, as several recent studies point out [34] , [35] . Interestingly, the pallidum effect over the course of AD is only detected using stage-wise modelling since it shows early degeneration but then it remains unaffected by the course of the disease. Some other structures, such as pericalcarine at PC stage or pallidum at AD-dementia stage, showed increased volume/thickness once corrected by age and the intracranial volume, which might be interpreted as compensatory effects due to increasing brain activity at those regions [36] , [37] .\nMoreover, we provide a confounder model orthogonal to the AD continuum model that attempt to describe the brain aging process. It is estimated using only healthy control subjects and presents consistent results with the literature [38] - [40] for both volumetric and cortical thickness features involving global atrophy and cortical thinning, except for the choroid plexus region. This pattern appear to be highly correlated pre-dementia stages (HC, PC, MCI) but has low effect strength at the dementia stage, providing more evidence of a higher overlap between aging and disease processes at later stages.\nFinally, we assess the predictive power of both models and compare to standard linear regression model. Using stage-wise modeling increases the overfitting at each stage, but the effect is mitigated using PLSR compared to linear regression. However, using a single model for the whole AD continuum provides similar results for both methods. Overall, the predictive performance is moderate to low and depends on the disease stage, being worse at later stages (AD-dementia).\nOur results highlight the potential of using multivariate models to better detect and disentangle aging and AD pathological effects on brain structure instead of using univariate regression models and hypothesis testing studying each brain region independently [41] . Multivariate models are able to capture relevant and spatially distributed patterns of structural changes in the brain. In this work, we identify patterns of common variability between AD pathology, defined using CSF biomarkers, and brain structure, defined using either volumetric or thickness features. Throughout the literature, many multivariate approaches define AD pathology with binary or categorical variables (e.g: clinical diagnosis [22] , [42] or amyloid status [10] , [21] ) and use machine learning as a multivariate model. However, the quantization of AD pathology in few categories reduces the modeling capacity of its variability and heterogeneity. To account for that, other works use single continuous clinical scores [18] , [23] , which is suited for modeling the later stages of the disease. Instead, CSF biomarkers, as used in our approach, are shown to better describe the full spectrum of AD [20] . Another recent multivariate approach to detect brain changes uses an event-based model [43] that clusters subjects depending on spatially distributed and temporally aligned brain changes, being well-suited for e.g. patient staging. However, they make a set of assumptions such that biomarkers vary independently and do not make use of underlying AD pathological markers. Instead of finding a sequence of events, in this work we could identify few underlying patterns of brain variability that are maximally related to AD pathology finding three different types of patterns: age-related, AD-related and mixed age and AD related."}, {"section_title": "V. CONCLUSION", "text": "We present a multivariate framework that describes structural changes related two different processes that may occur simultaneously in elderly subjects: brain aging and brain AD. Age and CSF biomarkers describe each process, respectively, and brain morphological features are used to assess brain structural information. PLSR is used to find latent spaces related to each brain condition and we incorporate a orthogonality constraint between both subspaces. Results show that along the AD continuum brain patterns related to age, AD and a mixture of both coexist which might indicate that brain aging and AD processes partially overlap. As largely investigated in the literature, we found that temporal lobe changes occur earlier in the disease continuum and are followed by later changes in parietal regions. Moreover, some regions of the brain present compensation effects once brain aging is considered. AD pathology expresses similarly in volumetric and cortical thickness features. One limitation of the model is that localized interpretations of condition effects (e.g. aging, dementia) in independent ROIs is not possible and the only conclusion that can be drawn is related to the overall morphometric patterns found.
