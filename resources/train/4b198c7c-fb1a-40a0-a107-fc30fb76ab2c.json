Indeed, greater PET-A\u03b2 burden was associated with smaller volume cross-sectionally Hanseeuw, Dricot, Lhommel, Quenon, & Ivanoiu, 2016; Mormino et al., 2009 ) and faster volume decline longitudinally in the whole hippocampus (Villemagne et al., 2013) in nondemented elderly. Nevertheless, lack of association between PET-A\u03b2 and whole hippocampal atrophy was also found in cognitively normal elderly (Becker et al., 2011) . Given A\u03b2-associated hippocampal atrophy in nondemented elderly but not in patients with AD-dementia (Chetelat et al., 2010) , it may be implied that A\u03b2 affects hippocampal degeneration more robustly in early disease stage while other pathologies contribute more in dementia stage. This is in line with the AD Pathological Cascade model (Jack Jr. et al., 2013) proposing that A\u03b2 accumulation precedes hippocampal atrophy and both reach a plateau at dementia or earlier. Nonetheless, the longitudinal trajectory of A\u03b2-associated hippocampal atrophy in predementia remains unclear.\nNotably, the hippocampus consists of several subfields (Bakker, Kirwan, Miller, & Stark, 2008; Small, Schobel, Buxton, Witter, & Barnes, 2011) . A review concluded selective subfield atrophy before dementia, more consistently in the CA1/subiculum (de Flores, La Joie, & Chetelat, 2015) . Few studies tested A\u03b2-associated subfield atrophy in nondemented elderly, showing smaller subiculum/hippocampal-tail/presubiculum in A\u03b2-positive no cognitive impairment (NCI; vs. A\u03b2-negative NCI) (Hsu et al., 2015) , and smaller CA1/subiculum in A\u03b2-positive mild cognitive impairment (MCI) compared with NCI (but no difference compared with A\u03b2-negative MCI) (La . These findings suggest selective hippocampal subfield atrophy related to A\u03b2 in predementia.\nHowever, previous studies relied on manual segmentation or earlier in-vivo atlas-based FreeSurfer approach (Hsu et al., 2015) , leading to hippocampal segmentation inaccuracy (Iglesias et al., 2015; Wisse, Biessels, & Geerlings, 2014) . Moreover, cross-sectional design and dichotomized A\u03b2-status prevented them from testing longitudinal trajectories of A\u03b2-associated subfield atrophy accurately. Therefore, we aimed to investigate how A\u03b2 influence hippocampalsubfield atrophy in NCI/MCI longitudinally in two independent datasets, applying a novel ex-vivo ultra-high-resolution atlas-based automatic hippocampal segmentation (FreeSurfer v.6.0). We hypothesized A\u03b2associated longitudinal atrophy in selective subfields (e.g., CA1/ subiculum), spreading to other subfields over disease deterioration in nondemented elderly. Furthermore, we tested whether A\u03b2-associated progressive subfield atrophy correlated with memory decline."}, {"section_title": "| METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "| Participants", "text": "This study recruited participants from two independent datasets: After image quality control (see Section 2.4), 52 NCI and 77 MCI from the ADNI were included in the final cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses with annual follow-ups up to 4-years (Table 1) .\nFor the MACC dataset, 15 NCI and 76 MCI were included in the cross-sectional analyses.

Other scanning parameters depended on the scanner used at different sites, as described on the ADNI website (ADNI, 2011); (b) MACC dataset: PET scanning was performed on a Siemens Biograph mMR scanner (Delso et al., 2011) at the Clinical Imaging Research Centre (National University of Singapore, Singapore), 370 MBq 11 C-PIB injection was followed by static data acquisition from 40 to 70 min post injection (176 axial slices, voxel size = 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 3 mm 3 , FOV = 256 \u00d7 256 mm 2 ).\nFor MACC dataset, PET data were acquired per participant once during the whole longitudinal project.

Since not all MACC baseline structural-images were used for longitudinal investigation (see Section 2.3), cross-sectional pipeline of hippocampal subfield segmentation (FreeSurfer v.6.0) (Iglesias et al., 2015) was applied for the MACC cross-sectional analysis, which was similar to the longitudinal pipeline without creating a subject-specific template. Importantly, both algorithms were based on a probabilistic atlas acquired from ultra-high resolution (~0.1 mm) ex vivo MRI data, showing significantly improved segmentation accuracy compared with previous method based on in vivo atlas from the earlier FreeSurfer v.5.3, and better alignment with previous histological studies (Iglesias et al., 2015; Iglesias et al., 2016) .

Specifically, in ADNI MCI, A\u03b2-related progressive atrophy widely spread to all the subfields (ps \u2264.05 after multiple comparison correction) ( Figure 2 , Table Se-2) .

The CA1"}, {"section_title": "| DISCUSSION", "text": "and subiculum are key regions of the hippocampal circuit, being associated with input integration and memory retrieval, respectively (Small et al., 2011) . Also, smaller ML has been correlated with poorer performance in memory retrieval (Zheng et al., 2018) . Altogether, it may be implied that progressive atrophy in the CA1, ML, and subiculum relates to impaired memory functioning. That volume decline in these subfields correlated with memory decline in MCI lent further support.\nMoreover, more widespread A\u03b2-associated atrophy progression in ADNI MCI (versus MACC MCI) was not due to its longer follow-up ( (den Heijer et al., 2012) , which has been suggested to be A\u03b2-independent (Vemuri et al., 2015) . Indeed, MACC MCI subsample after excluding those with more severe WMH showed A\u03b2-associated volume decline in the same subfields, but to a stronger extent. Future studies need to investigate the relationship between A\u03b2, individual cerebrovascular markers, and hippocampal subfield atrophy. In contrast to the observed widespread volume decline in MCI, NCI showed subtle volume decline in the CA1 selectively across both datasets.\nInterestingly, CA1 atrophy has also been observed in other disorders (e.g., bipolar disorder (Bearden et al., 2008) , and schizophrenia (Ho et al., 2017) ), suggesting a general CA1 vulnerability.\nTaken together, we propose that A\u03b2-associated subfield atrophy progression takes the form of a focal-to-widespread pattern as disease progresses from NCI to MCI. The AD Pathological Cascade model (Jack Jr. et al., 2013) and Amyloid/Tau/Neurodegeneration AD biomarkers system (Jack Jr. et al., 2016) have highlighted the role of individual AD biomarkers. Our results underscore the importance of associations between individual biomarkers, potentially leading to a better understanding of the underlying disease mechanism."}, {"section_title": "| Possible underlying mechanisms of A\u03b2 modulation on the hippocampal subfield atrophy", "text": "Although the underlying neurotoxic mechanism of A\u03b2 remains controversial, it has been suggested that A\u03b2 induces synaptic loss and impairs neuronal function, resulting in neurodegeneration (Masters et al., 2006) . Our study replicated previous findings of neocortex A\u03b2hippocampal atrophy association in nondemented elderly (Chetelat et al., 2010; Mormino et al., 2009 ). This could not be contributed to hippocampal A\u03b2 deposition (Chetelat et al., 2010) , which is none or low in early stage (Thal, Rub, Orantes, & Braak, 2002) . Several possibilities may be proposed. Specifically, key cortical regions for earliest A\u03b2 deposition (e.g., PCC/precuneus, orbital frontal; Palmqvist et al., 2017 ) could connect to hippocampus via white matter tracts (e.g., from the orbital frontal via uncinate fasciculus, and from the PCC/retrosplenial via cingulum; Greicius, Supekar, Menon, & Dougherty, 2009; Vipin et al., 2019) . This implies a structural pathway where abnormal A\u03b2 may modulate. Indeed, A\u03b2 has been associated with longitudinal impairment of white matter integrity before dementia (Vipin et al., 2019) . Also, reduced precuneus-hippocampus functional connectivity has been found in nondemented participants with positive A\u03b2 compared with those with negative A\u03b2 (Sheline et al., 2010) , providing a potential functional pathway. Notably, we showed that regional A\u03b2 burden in these regions was associated with memory decline especially in MCI patients (Table Se- 12) . We did not find global A\u03b2-memory decline association, which was in line with previous animal/human literature (i.e., association between global A\u03b2 and cognition was generally absent or weak if any; Chetelat et al., 2012; Foley, Ammar, Lee, & Mitchell, 2015) . Our findings may indicate a possible region-specific influence of A\u03b2 on longitudinal memory decline. Nonetheless, future work is needed to study the spatiotemporal relationship between regional A\u03b2, hippocampal subfield degeneration, and memory decline in longer follow-up period. Another possibility links to soluble A\u03b2 that precedes A\u03b2 plaques formation, and has been suggested to affect hippocampal neurodegeneration via disturbing synaptic processing based on transgenic mice model of AD (Perez-Cruz et al., 2011) . Soluble A\u03b2 has also been shown to induce hippocampal neuronal hyperactivity at early disease stage in transgenic AD mice, which has been hypothesized to be associated with neuronal dysfunction and cell death at a later stage (Busche et al., 2012; Busche & Konnerth, 2015) .\nFurthermore, given the association between tau deposition and atrophy in the whole hippocampus or hippocampal subfields (Apostolova et al., 2015) , hippocampal subfield atrophy might be contributed by hippocampal tau deposition, which coincides with neocortex A\u03b2 accumulation in early stage (Braak, Alafuzoff, Arzberger, Kretzschmar, & Del Tredici, 2006) . Supporting preliminary evidence from ADNI MCI group suggested that A\u03b2-associated progressive hippocampal subfield atrophy was more pronounced in MCI with p-tau positivity, but not in MCI with p-tau negativity (Table Se- 14) . Further systematic investigation into the interactions between region-specific tau and A\u03b2 deposition and their impact on neurodegeration over time is needed using tau-PET method (Hall et al., 2017) .\nRegarding the selective CA1 volume decline in NCI, the CA1 has more than 21 types of inhibitory interneurons (Klausberger & Somogyi, 2008) , and CA1 interneurons reduction has been found in transgenic AD mice (Takahashi et al., 2010) . This might lead to an excitation-inhibition imbalance in the CA1, being associated with synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss. The largest number of neurons (West & Gundersen, 1990) and capillaries (Lokkegaard, Nyengaard, & West, 2001) as estimated in the CA1 (vs. other subfields) might also contribute. Altogether, we propose that the CA1 atrophy represents a general and early vulnerability to AD and the atrophy spreads to other subfields over time via possible mechanisms as mentioned above. Although we could not pinpoint the exact neocortex A\u03b2-hippocampal atrophy pathway(s), our result replications in two datasets provide convincing evidence for the focal-towidespread pattern of A\u03b2-associated subfield atrophy over time."}, {"section_title": "| Limitations and future directions", "text": "There were some limitations. Firstly, MACC-dataset had fewer NCI (n = 15) than ADNI-dataset (n = 52). However, similar results were observed between datasets. Secondly, other variables may also contribute to hippocampal subfield atrophy and disease progression (e.g., tau pathology and cerebrovascular factors) in addition to A\u03b2 (Apostolova et al., 2015; den Heijer et al., 2012) . Future studies need to take into consideration the spatial quantification of A\u03b2 instead of an average A\u03b2 burden, and determine the contributing variables and the temporal relationships underlying disease progression. Finally, it would be interesting to test how A\u03b2 affects the hippocampus along the anterior-posterior axis in predementia stages."}, {"section_title": "| CONCLUSION", "text": "To conclude, converging results from two independent datasets showed that greater A\u03b2 burden correlated with selective CA1 volume decline in NCI and longitudinal atrophy extension into other subfields in MCI, resulting in a focal-to-widespread longitudinal trajectory.\nMoreover, the A\u03b2-associated progressive subfield atrophy correlated with memory decline in MCI, hence, potentially serving as imaging markers for disease progression monitoring."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "We thank all the participants for their contributions to the study.
