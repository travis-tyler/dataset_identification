Students who had completed or expected to complete a bachelor's degree between July 1992 and June 1993 were selected from a cross-section of students in all levels and sectors of postsecondary education 1 to participate in the first Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B). These graduates were located and surveyed again in 1994 and 1997. In 2003, 10 years after they had completed a bachelor's degree, the final follow-up of this cohort took place. Using data from the 2003 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:93/03), this report provides an overview of the status of 1992-93 college graduates 10 years after graduation. The estimates in this report are based on the results of surveys with approximately 9,000 bachelor's degree recipients, representing about 1.2 million bachelor's degree completers from 1992-93. This report presents the concluding data that were collected in the B&B series, completing the picture of various outcomes for these graduates 10 years after they completed a bachelor's degree.

This included 25 percent who had completed such a degree, 6 percent who were currently enrolled, and 9 percent who had enrolled in a graduate program but left without completing one (table 1). Specifically, about one-fourth of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients earned an advanced degree (master's, doctoral, or first-professional degree) during the past 10 years (figure A). Twenty percent of students earned a master's degree, 4 percent earned a first-professional degree, and 2 percent earned a doctoral degree. Men were more likely than women to earn a doctoral or firstprofessional degree, while women were more likely than men to earn a master's degree (table 2). These patterns were consistent with those observed for the same cohort of graduates in 1997 (Clune, Nu\u00f1ez, and Choy 2001). Graduates' baccalaureate major was associated with their likelihood of entering and completing an advanced degree. For example, graduates who earned a bachelor's degree in education were more likely than those who majored in other subjects (except in arts and humanities) to have earned a master's degree by 2003 (table 2). Graduates' field of employment was also related to their likelihood of completing an advanced degree. Consistent with the results for undergraduate major, those working in education were more likely than those working in any other occupation to hold a master's degree (38 vs. 9-20 percent). Reflecting the fact that the M.D. and D.D.S. are first-professional degrees, health professionals were more likely to hold a first-professional degree than graduates working in other occupations.\nGraduate enrollments have increased since the early 1970s, with particularly high growth earlier in the period (U.S. Department of Education 2002). Among 1992-93 college graduates, 29 percent had enrolled in a master's, doctoral, or first-professional degree program when interviewed in 1997, within 4 years of completing college, with enrollment the highest during the first year after receiving a bachelor's degree (Clune, Nu\u00f1ez, and Choy 2001). Of those who had enrolled, about three-fourths (76 percent) were in a master's degree program, 14 percent in a firstprofessional program, and 10 percent in a doctoral program (McCormick et al. 1999). In fact, by 1997, 15 percent had attained a master's, doctoral, or first-professional degree (Clune, Nu\u00f1ez, and Choy 2001). This section describes the extent to which the 1992-93 graduates had enrolled in and completed graduate programs 3 by 2003, 10 years after they obtained a bachelor's degree."}, {"section_title": "Employment", "text": "In 2003, 10 years after earning a bachelor's degree, most college graduates (87 percent) were employed, primarily in one full-time job (70 per- 1 Includes postbaccalaureate certificates. NOTE: Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding. SOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 1993Statistics, -2003 v   cent; table 3). Nine percent were employed in multiple jobs, and 8 percent had one part-time job. Another 4 percent were unemployed (not working, but looking for work), and the remaining 9 percent were out of the labor force (not working and not looking for work). Graduates' educational attainment after earning the 1992-93 bachelor's degree was related to their chances of working full time, part time, or in multiple jobs. For example, about 80 percent of graduates with first-professional or doctoral degrees worked at one full-time job, compared with 71 percent of those with master's degrees and 69 percent with bachelor's degrees. Among 1992-93 college graduates who were employed in 2003, salaries varied widely by levels of education and employment and by occupation (table 4). The average salary for full-time workers was $60,700, and the median salary was $52,000. Consistent with earlier results for this cohort (Bradburn and Berger 2002), men earned more than women among those working full time or in multiple jobs (figure B). Higher degrees were also associated with higher salaries, and full-time workers in business and management and in engineering, architecture, or computer science earned more than their counterparts in many other occupations (table 4).\nUsing previous rounds of B&B data for the 1992-93 cohort of college graduates, NCES has produced a number of descriptive reports that examine various aspects of graduates' employment after leaving college. These topics include the relationship of undergraduate major to employment outcomes (Horn and Zahn 2001), the prevalence of alternative employment such as part-time work, self-employment, and employment in multiple jobs (Bradburn and Berger 2002), and occupational attrition or stability over time (Henke and Zahn 2001). This section provides the latest look at the employment characteristics of this cohort of graduates, describing their labor force participation and salaries in 2003. 4"}, {"section_title": "Looking Back: Opinions About Education", "text": "Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients, about three-fifths reported that the quality of instruction they received as undergraduates (61 percent) and their undergraduate major field (58 percent) remained very important to their lives 10 years later (figure C). Smaller percentages of graduates reported this lasting influence of the liberal arts courses they took (36 percent), the undergraduate professional courses they took (50 percent), or any internship or work opportunities they had as undergraduates (42 percent). A number of characteristics of their undergraduate education were related to these assessments. For example, in 2003,graduates of public institutions were more likely than graduates of private not-forprofit institutions to report that their major field,  Statistics, 1993Statistics, -2003  vi the professional classes they took, and their internship or other work opportunities as undergraduates were very important 10 years after graduation, (table 6). On the other hand, a larger percentage of graduates of private not-for-profit institutions than graduates of public institutions said that liberal arts courses and the quality of instruction they received were very important. The graduates were also asked whether they considered their undergraduate education (as a whole) to be very important preparation for their work and career, further education, and financial security (table 7). Nearly four out of five graduates (78 percent) reported that their undergraduate education was very important in preparing them for their work and career; a majority also indicated that their college years prepared them for further education (56 percent) and achieving financial security (57 percent). Yet 8 percent did not feel that their undergraduate education was very important preparation for any of these areas. Finally, the graduates evaluated their undergraduate education favorably. At least 9 out of 10 felt that obtaining a bachelor's degree was worth the financial cost, time, and effort that had been required (90, 93, and 96 percent, respectively; table 8).\nThe 2003 follow-up completes the study of this cohort of bachelor's degree recipients and, as the final installment of information about their postbaccalaureate paths, represents an appropriate time to ask graduates to reflect on their college years. Several items in the survey asked them to assess their undergraduate education: the value of specific aspects of their college education to them now; the usefulness of their undergraduate education as a whole to some of the broad areas of their lives; and the overall worth of the investments they made in their college years. This section summarizes how college graduates evaluated their undergraduate education 10 years after bachelor's degree completion."}, {"section_title": "Family Status", "text": "Among 1992-93 college graduates, about onethird of women (34 percent) and one-fourth of men (26 percent) had married before earning a bachelor's degree (Clune, Nu\u00f1ez, and Choy 2001). In 2003, about two-thirds (68 percent) of 1992-93 graduates were married, and 20 percent were single and had never been married (table 9). Smaller percentages reported that they were divorced (6 percent), cohabiting (4 percent), separated (1 percent), or widowed (0.4 percent). Pursuit of a graduate education and employment were associated with a lower likelihood of marriage. Those 1992-93 graduates who had completed a doctoral or first-professional degree were more likely than other graduates to be single in 2003 (29 vs. 19-20 percent), and they were less likely to be married (61 vs. 68-69 percent). Those who had received a doctoral or first-professional degree were also less likely than others to be di- Executive Summary vii vorced (3 vs. 6 percent). Graduates who worked part time or were out of the labor force were less likely than other graduates to be single and never married. Conversely, graduates who worked part time and those who were out of the labor force were more likely than other graduates to be married (78 and 87 percent, respectively, vs. 54-66 percent). When they completed college in 1992-93, 14 percent of this cohort already had children, and 13 percent of the other graduates had become parents within 4 years (Clune, Nu\u00f1ez, and Choy 2001). Ten years after college completion, about one-half (51 percent) of graduates had children under age 18 (table 10): 21 percent had one child, 22 percent had two children, and 9 percent had three or more children. As with marriage, graduate education was associated with a lower likelihood of having children.\nAmong 1992-93 college graduates, about one-third of women (34 percent) and one-fourth of men (26 percent) had married before earning a bachelor's degree, and 14 percent already had children (Clune, Nu\u00f1ez, and Choy 2001). Among recent college graduates, marriage, parenthood, graduate education, and employment sometimes compete with each other as graduates pursue different paths and goals (Clune, Nu\u00f1ez, and Choy 2001;Moen 1992). In this section, the marital and parental status of 1992-93 college graduates in 2003 is examined in relation to the other roles they hold as well as their demographic characteristics."}, {"section_title": "Civic Participation", "text": "The college graduates described in this report had 10 years to complete additional education, enter careers, and pursue other interests. Many of them had established ties to the community, which were reflected in their volunteer work. Overall, nearly one-half (47 percent) of the 1992-93 graduate cohort reported in 2003 that they had participated in community service in the past year (table 11). Of those who had volunteered, 44 percent reported that they had provided service to a religious institution, 39 percent had worked on fundraising, and 32 percent had participated in educationrelated activities (figure D). As of 2003, female college graduates were more likely than their male counterparts to have volunteered in the past year (50 vs. 43 percent) (table 11). Among those who had volunteered, women were more likely than men to have served in educational or religious institutions, while men were more likely than women to have done other volunteer work with children or to have participated in poverty or neighborhood improvement projects. These patterns are consistent with those found among 1999-2000 bachelor's degree recipients in 2001 (Bradburn et al. 2003). Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who had volunteered in the past year, as of 2003, 27 percent reported that they had done so less than once a month, 29 percent had done so monthly, and 34 percent had done so weekly (table 12). On average, the total number of volunteer hours they had logged in that period was 148 hours. About 9 out of 10 (93 percent) of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who were U.S. citizens or nationals were registered to vote in 2003, and a majority (76 percent) had voted in the 2002 election (table 13). Smaller percentages of graduates had contacted a public official by letter, e-mail, or telephone in the past 2 years (36 percent) or had attended some sort of political event, such as a dinner or a rally, in the past year (15 percent). Older college graduates were more likely than younger ones to have voted in the 2002 elections or to have contacted a public official in the past 2 years. xvii Table  Page Section V: Civic Participation \nConsiderable attention has been paid in recent years to community service and the role that education may play in fostering this civic participation. NCES data have been used to describe the community service experiences of the nation's secondary students (Nolin, Chaney, and Chapman 1997;Kleiner and Chapman 1999;Skinner and Chapman 1999), and such experiences are associated with increased community service participation in college (Sax and Astin 1997). In 2001, 43 percent of all 1999-2000 college graduates reported having done community service in the past year (Bradburn et al. 2003). Furthermore, community service during the undergraduate years was associated with higher rates of graduate school attendance, attainment of higher degrees, and a higher likelihood of participating in community service activities in the years following college (Astin, Sax, and Avalos 1999). Political involvement is also alive and well on college campuses: students entering college in the late 1980s (many of whom would have completed a bachelor's degree in 1992-93) appeared to be more inclined toward social activism than their counterparts in earlier years (Astin 1991). Did the activities of the 1992-93 graduates 10 years later reflect high rates of involvement in community and political affairs? This section describes graduates' civic participation in 2003."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In the 1992-93 academic year, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) embarked on its first long-term longitudinal study of bachelor's degree recipients, the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B). Students who had completed or expected to complete a bachelor's degree between July 1992 and June 1993 were selected from a cross-section of students in all levels and sectors of postsecondary education in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. These graduates were interviewed in 1993, then located and surveyed again in 1994and 1997. In 2003 years after they had completed a bachelor's degree, the final follow-up of this cohort took place. This report provides a descriptive summary of the activities of this cohort of college graduates at the time of their interviews in 2003. Where similar information is available for the graduates when they were last interviewed in 1997, it is provided for context. However, this report does not test for changes over time within this cohort of bachelor's degree recipients. The 2003 survey, like the previous follow-ups, asked bachelor's degree recipients about many aspects of their lives, including their education, employment, family, civic participation, and finances, as well as their attitudes and opinions about many of their experiences. The wealth of information available in the 2003 survey-not to mention the combined information of four separate waves of data-is vast, and no single report can begin to do justice to the complexity of the data. Instead, this report provides an introduction to the 2003 data, offering a snapshot of activities in five areas by the 1992-93 cohort 10 years after they had graduated: subsequent education, employment, opinions about education, family status, and civic participation. Following a description of the data and methods, the body of the report provides a general overview of the graduates' responses to selected items in these five areas, addressing the following questions: \u2022 How much education beyond a bachelor's degree had 1992-93 graduates completed by 2003? This report also contains a table compendium as a reference to the wider range of information collected in this study. The compendium is organized into sections that correspond to the major sections of the overview: Education, Employment, Opinions About Education, Family Status, and Civic Participation. In each section, selected statistically significant findings are presented at the beginning, followed by the tables for that section. The tables provide further detail about the questions discussed in the overview, as well as additional information about other outcomes in each topic area. The variables used in this report are defined in appendix A.

The final follow-up, conducted 10 years later in 2003, is the focus of this report. The estimates in this report are based on the results of surveys with approximately 9,000 bachelor's degree recipients, representing about 1.2 million people who completed a bachelor's degree in 1992-93. The Internet-based survey could be self-administered or completed over the telephone with a trained interviewer. The weighted overall response rate for the B&B:93/03 interview was 74 percent, reflecting a base-year institution response rate of 88 percent and a 2003 follow-up student response rate of 83 percent. For more information about the B&B:93/03 data collection, see appendix B of this report. While information about this cohort from the 1997 data collection is used to provide context for the relationships presented in the analysis here, no longitudinal analysis of change in the graduates' roles over time is conducted. In addition, the analysis conducted for this report generally does not control for the interrelationships among the variables considered; rather, it is designed to provide a descriptive overview of the activities of the 1992-93 college graduates 10 years later. Thus, one should use caution in drawing conclusions based solely on the results presented here. Future NCES reports will explore selected topics in much greater depth, and researchers are invited to conduct their own analyses of the B&B:93/03 data. To avoid confounding influences of previous undergraduate experience, all analyses in this report are restricted to those for whom the 1992-93 bachelor's degree was the first bachelor's degree received (about 93 percent of the sample). Information about the operational definitions of this and other variables used in this report can be found in appendix A. Many results in this report are presented by demographic or undergraduate educational characteristics. The distribution of the group of first-time bachelor's degree recipients analyzed in this report is available in appendix B. Demographic characteristics considered included gender, race/ethnicity, parents' highest level of education, and age at bachelor's completion. Distributions by baccalaureate degree major and the sector of the degree-granting institution are also shown. All comparisons made in the text were tested using Student's t statistic for comparing two numbers or F-tests for overall significance and linear trends for comparisons across ordered categories. All differences cited were statistically significant at the .05 level. The formulas used and more detail on significance levels are provided in appendix B."}, {"section_title": "Participation in Graduate Programs", "text": "By 2003, 40 percent of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients had enrolled in a master's, doctoral, or first-professional degree program. This included 25 percent who completed a graduate degree, 6 percent who were enrolled in graduate education as of 2003, and 9 percent who had enrolled but left without completing a program (figure 1). Among those who had enrolled in a graduate program, about three-fifths (62 percent) had completed a degree, 15 percent were enrolled, and 23 percent left without a degree. Parents' education was associated with the cohort's graduate enrollment: as of the 1997 interview, graduates whose parents had advanced degrees were more likely than others to be enrolled in an advanced degree program (McCormick et al. 1999). This pattern was observed in 2003 as well (table 1). Those bachelor's degree recipients who had parents with advanced degrees were more likely to enroll in a graduate program than those who had parents with bachelor's degrees, some postsecondary education, or a high school diploma or less. Graduates whose parents had more education were also more likely to have completed a graduate degree by 2003. For example, while one-third (33 percent) of college graduates whose parents had advanced degrees completed such a degree themselves within 10 years, 19-25 percent of other graduates completed an advanced degree. Both undergraduate major and grade point average (GPA) were related to pursuing graduate education among the 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients. Approximately one-half of those graduates who had a bachelor's degree major in natural sciences and mathematics, education, and social and behavioral sciences (57, 50, and 50 percent, respectively) enrolled in an advanced degree program; more than those in all other fields. Business majors were less likely than other majors to have enrolled in a graduate program (25 vs. 34-57 percent). Natural sciences and mathematics majors were also more likely than others to have completed a graduate program in the 10 years since bachelor's degree completion (39 vs. 17-30 percent). Undergraduate GPA was also associated with enrollment in a graduate program. A greater proportion of students with an undergraduate GPA of 2.75 or higher enrolled in and completed such a program than those with lower GPAs. Graduates' patterns of enrollment in and completion of graduate programs 10 years after college were consistent with their plans at the time of graduation. About two-thirds (65 percent) of those who aspired to earn a doctoral or first-professional degree enrolled in a graduate program after bachelor's degree completion. These graduates were more likely than those who expected to complete less education to have enrolled. Furthermore, those who expected to earn a master's degree were more likely than those who expected to earn a bachelor's degree to have enrolled. Higher degree expectations were also associated with a higher likelihood of completing a graduate degree within 10 years of college graduation.

Graduates with a bachelor's degree in natural sciences and mathematics were more likely than those who majored in other subjects to earn a doctoral degree (9 percent vs. up to 3 percent). Graduates with majors in natural sciences and mathematics or in social and behavioral sciences were also more likely than those with other majors to earn a first-professional degree. About one-fourth (26 percent) of graduates who earned a bachelor's degree in education had a master's degree by 2003, a higher percentage than graduates with majors in business, health, public affairs/social services, natural sciences and mathematics, or \"other\" unspecified fields. Students who expected, at the time they graduated from college, to earn a master's degree were more likely than those who expected to earn a bachelor's degree to attain a master's degree by 2003 (21 vs. 8 percent). Students with master's degree expectations were, however, less likely than those with doctoral or first-professional degree expectations to earn a master's degree (21 vs. 25 percent), perhaps because graduates who expected a doctoral degree may have earned a master's degree en route to a doctorate. A greater proportion of college graduates who expected to earn a doctoral or first-professional degree than those who expected to earn a bachelor's or master's degree attained a first-professional degree. Finally, 7 percent of those college graduates who expected to earn a doctoral or first-professional degree completed a doctorate within 10 years of college graduation, compared with less than 1 percent of those who expected to earn a bachelor's or master's degree. Similar to the results related to bachelor's degree major, college graduates working in the education field were more likely than those working in any other occupation to hold a master's degree (38 vs. 9-20 percent). Reflecting the fact that the M.D. and D.D.S. are first-professional degrees, health professionals were more likely to hold a first-professional degree than bachelor's degree recipients working in other occupations. Those working in research or other professional or technical occupations were generally more likely than those working in other occupations (excluding health) to hold a first-professional degree. Additionally, those in the health field were more likely than those in most other occupations to hold a doctoral degree, except for those in the education and research fields."}, {"section_title": "Labor Force Participation", "text": "In 2003, 10 years after earning a bachelor's degree, most bachelor's degree recipients (87 percent) were employed, primarily in one full-time job (70 percent; table 3). Nine percent were employed in multiple jobs, and 8 percent had one part-time job. 5 Another 4 percent were unemployed (not working, but looking for work), and the remaining 9 percent were out of the labor force (not working and not looking for work). Consistent with findings from the 1994 and 1997 waves of this study (Horn and Zahn 2001;Bradburn and Berger 2002), gender differences in the likelihood of being employed part time or being out of the labor force were found. In 2003, men were more likely than women to work full time (81 vs. 61 percent), while women were more likely than men to work part time (12 vs. 3 percent) or to be out of the labor force (15 vs. 2 percent). Educational attainment after earning the 1992-93 bachelor's degree was also related to the likelihood of working full time, part time, or in multiple jobs (table 3). College graduates who had attained doctoral or first-professional degrees before 2003 were more likely to be employed full time than those who had earned master's degrees or bachelor's degrees. About 80 percent of bachelor's degree recipients with first-professional or doctoral degrees worked at one full-time job, compared with 71 percent of graduates with master's degrees and 69 percent with bachelor's degrees. Among graduates with advanced degrees, field of study for that degree was related to the intensity of their labor force participation as well. Graduates whose major or field of study in Table 3.-Percentage distribution of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients' current labor force participation,  Table 3.-by demographic, educational, and employment characteristics:  their highest degree was science, mathematics, or engineering were more likely than those who studied all other subjects except business to work full time 10 years after graduating from college (85 vs. 52-74 percent; figure 3). Bachelor's degree recipients who studied arts and humanities for their highest degree were the least likely group to work full time when compared with those who most recently studied other fields (with the exception of social and behavioral sciences): 52 percent of graduates who studied arts and humanities for an advanced degree worked full time, compared with 67-85 percent. For college graduates whose highest degree was a bachelor's degree, however, field of study for that degree may be less relevant to their employment 10 years later, because college graduates often change fields upon entering the job market or later on in their career (Henke and Zahn 2001). Examining labor market participation by occupation provides a more up-to-date look at labor force participation by field for all graduates. Although the majority of college graduates in all occupations were employed 10 years after earning a bachelor's degree, those in some occupations were more likely than others to be employed in one full-time job. Specifically, 85 percent of graduates working in engineering, architecture, or computer science were employed full time, compared with 78 percent of those in business and management, 69 percent in service industries, 68 percent in research or other professional or technical occupations, 68 percent in other unspecified occupations, 66 percent of educators, and 57 percent of health professionals.

Table 4 shows the average and median salaries for bachelor's degree recipients employed in one full-time job, one part-time job, and in multiple jobs. The average salary for full-time workers was $60,700, and the median salary was $52,000. Consistent with earlier results for this cohort (Bradburn and Berger 2002), men earned more than women in their full-time work: men earned an average of $69,900 per year, compared with $50,600 for women. The median salaries reflected the same pattern, with men's median salary about $15,000 higher than women's among full-time workers (figure 4). However, gender differences in salary are lower among bachelor's degree recipients than among employees with less education, and these gaps have closed over time (U.S. Department of Education 2002). In general, college graduates with higher degrees earned more than those with lower degrees. Among graduates who worked full time, those with a doctoral or first-professional degree earned an average of $80,900 annually, compared with $61,100 for master's degree recipients and $58,800 for bachelor's degree recipients. The same pattern emerged for graduates with multiple jobs, with doctoral or first-professional degree recipients earning an average of $65,000, compared with $47,900 for master's degree recipients and $47,000 for bachelor's degree recipients. Engineers, architects, and computer scientists not only were more likely to work full time than their peers in other occupations but also earned higher salaries than those in several other fields (table 4). Full-time workers in this group, along with those in business and management, earned higher salaries than their counterparts in education, service industries, research, or other unspecified occupations. Ten years after earning a bachelor's degree, engineers, architects, and computer scientists averaged $72,200 per year, compared with an average annual salary of $69,700 for those in business or management and $41,900-66,900 for those in other occupations. Median salaries in business and management and in engineering, architecture, or computer science were also higher than those for other occupations, and the median salary for engineering, architecture, or computer science, at $69,000 per year, was also higher than that for business and management ($59,700). However, these findings varied by graduate degree attainment. Although graduate attainment was positively associated with higher average and median salaries for most occupations, college graduates who had completed a graduate degree and, in 2003, were employed in the service industry or as engineers, architects, or computer scientists did not report measurably higher salaries than their counterparts who had not attained graduate degrees. 6  Table 4.-Average annual salary of currently employed 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients, by  Table 4.-employment level, gender, highest degree, and occupation: 2003   Gender, highest degree,  Average  Median  Average  Median  Average  Median  and occupation  salary  salary  salary  salary  salary  Eighty percent of employed graduates worked full time 10 years after earning a bachelor's degree. They worked an average of 47 hours per week, and earned about $60,700 per year (table  5). However, the percentage working full time, number of hours worked per week, and salary varied by occupation. Table 5 presents these figures by gender and highest degree attained by 2003, separately within occupational categories. Consistent with earlier findings, salary differences by gender persisted even when occupation was taken into account. Men employed full time in business and management, education, health professions, service industries, and research earned more than their female counterparts in the same professions. Within some occupation groups, full-time workers who had doctoral or first-professional degrees worked more hours each week than their counterparts who had master's or bachelor's degrees. Those with doctoral or first-professional degrees who worked as educators averaged 53 hours per week, compared with 46-47 hours per week for bachelor's and master's degree recipients. Among health professionals, those with doctoral or first-professional degrees worked 61 hours per week, compared with 45-46 hours per week for those with bachelor's or master's degrees. Finally, in research and other professional or technical occupations, graduates with doctoral or first-professional degrees worked about 50 hours per week, while their peers with master's or bachelor's degrees worked 45 hours per week.  , 1993-2003 Table 5.-Percentage of currently employed 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who had one full-time job  Table 5.-and, of those, average hours worked per week and salary, by occupation, gender, and highest  Table 5 See notes at end of table.

About three-fifths of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients reported that the quality of instruction they received as undergraduates (61 percent) and their undergraduate major field (58 percent) remained very important to their lives 10 years later (table 6). These proportions were larger than those who attributed the same importance to the liberal arts courses they took, the undergraduate professional courses they took, or any internship or work opportunities they had as undergraduates (36 percent, 50 percent, and 42 percent, respectively). Baccalaureate degree major was related to the likelihood of reporting that undergraduate characteristics were very important 10 years later. College graduates who majored in health, engineering, education, or natural sciences and mathematics were more likely than those with any other major to report that their undergraduate major field was very important to their lives 10 years later (64-74 vs. 46-58 percent). On the other hand, humanities majors and social/ behavioral science majors were more likely than those with all other majors to indicate that their undergraduate liberal arts courses were very important to their lives; 61 percent of humanities majors and 49 percent of social/behavioral science majors said this, compared with 41 percent or less for other majors. Engineering majors were less likely than all other majors to report this importance of their liberal arts courses; 14 percent of engineering majors said those courses remained very important to their lives in 2003. Majors in health or in business were also less likely than others to say that the liberal arts courses they took were very important to their lives now. In contrast, health majors were more likely than graduates with other majors to report that their undergraduate professional courses remained very important to their lives, while humanities majors and social/behavioral sciences majors were less likely to do so. Finally, those who majored in education, health, humanities, or natural sciences and mathematics were more likely than business or engineering majors to report that the quality of the undergraduate instruction they received was very important 10 years later. Graduates of public institutions were more likely than graduates of private not-for-profit institutions to report that their major field, the professional classes they had taken, and their internship or other work opportunities as undergraduates were very important in 2003, 10 years after graduation. On the other hand, a larger percentage of graduates of private not-for-profit institutions than graduates of public institutions said that liberal arts courses and the quality of instruction they received were very important. Perhaps reflecting the relationship between undergraduate major field and subsequent occupation, among employed 1992-93 graduates, occupational field in 2003 was associated with a declared importance of undergraduate major field to their current lives. Specifically, employees in business, service industry, or other unspecified occupations (43-53 percent) were less likely than others to say their major field was very important 10 years later, while workers in education, health occupations, research or other professional or technical jobs, and engineering, architecture, or computer science (59-69 percent) were more likely to report this influence. Graduates employed in education, health, and research or other professional or technical fields were more likely than those employed in business, service industries, and other unspecified fields to claim that the quality of their undergraduate instruction was very important to their lives 10 years later. Employed graduates in education and in health were more likely than those in other occupations to say that undergraduate internships and other work opportunities were very important to their lives 10 years later. In addition, employees in research or other professional or technical jobs and in engineering, architecture, or computer science were more likely than employees in business or in other unspecified occupations to report this enduring influence. These results varied somewhat by graduate attainment. In general, college graduates who had completed a graduate degree were more likely than their counterparts who had not attained a graduate degree to report that their undergraduate major, liberal arts courses, and the quality of undergraduate instruction were very important 10 years later. 7 Graduates who majored in education or the social or behavioral sciences as undergraduates and had gone on to complete a graduate degree were more likely to consider their undergraduate education very important to their lives than their peers who majored in those subjects as undergraduates and did not complete a graduate degree. On the other hand, graduates with advanced degrees who were employed as en-gineers in 2003 were less likely to consider their undergraduate education very important compared with engineers who had not completed a graduate degree."}, {"section_title": "Influence of College on Work, Education, and Financial Security", "text": "The 1992-93 graduates were also asked about specific aspects of their lives-work and career, further education, and financial security-and whether they considered their undergraduate education (as a whole) to be very important preparation for those areas (table 7). Nearly four out of five graduates (78 percent) reported that their undergraduate education was very important in preparing them for their work and careers; a majority also indicated that their college years were very important preparation for their further education (56 percent) and financial security (57 percent). Yet 8 percent did not feel that their undergraduate education was very important to any of these aspects of their lives. Again, undergraduate major field and occupational area were related to the level of importance graduates attached to their undergraduate education for work, further education, and financial security. Nearly nine out of ten (88 percent) engineering majors reported that their undergraduate education was very important preparation for their work and career now, more than any other major except health. Undergraduate majors that prepare students for specific occupations, such as engineering or nursing, are typically more likely to be consistent with graduates' occupations after college (Horn and Zahn 2001). On the other hand, graduates who majored in humanities or in social and behavioral sciences (69-70 percent) were generally less likely than graduates with all other majors to feel that their undergraduate education was very important preparation for their work lives. Furthermore, graduates who majored in business or engineering as undergraduates were generally less likely than graduates who majored in all other fields to report that their undergraduate education was very important preparation for further education (46 and 47 vs. 52-67 percent). This may reflect the fact that business and engineering majors were less likely than those majoring in other fields to pursue graduate education (see table 1). However, two-thirds (67 percent) of majors in natural sciences and mathematics reported that college was very important to their further education. Finally, engineering and health majors were more likely than majors in all other fields to report that their undergraduate education was very important to their financial security 10 years later (71-72 percent vs. 48-62 percent). Some of these patterns by baccalaureate major translated into similar patterns by occupation. Employees in business, education, health, and engineering, architecture, or computer science were more likely than those working in other fields to say that their undergraduate education was very important preparation for their work and career (82-85 vs. 56-77 percent). For example, 85 percent of educators felt this way, compared with 69 percent of those employed in service industries. In addition, educators and health professionals (69 percent each), who tended to be more likely to continue their education (see compendium table I.1), were more likely than other graduates to feel that their college years were very important for their further education. Finally, engineers, architects, and computer scientists (67 percent) reported more often than all others except health professionals (62 percent) that their undergraduate education was very important preparation for their financial security. Professionals in health (62 percent) and business (61 percent) were also more likely than employees in most other fields (except education) to feel this way. Not just the field of employment but also the type of employer was related to the importance of undergraduate education for different aspects of graduates' lives in 2003. In particular, self-employed graduates were less likely than other graduates to feel that their undergraduate education was very important preparation for their work and career (67 vs. 77-83 percent). They were also less likely than those in the for-profit sector or at any level of government to feel that their undergraduate education was very important preparation for their financial security (50 vs. 57-60 percent). Graduates who were self-employed and those working in the for-profit sector were also less likely than other graduates to claim that their college years were very important preparation for further education (51 and 50 percent, respectively, vs. 61-66 percent). Graduates who had attained advanced degrees assessed the impact of their undergraduate experiences on their later education somewhat differently. College graduates who completed advanced degrees were consistently more likely than their peers who had not attained graduates degrees across all undergraduate major and occupation fields to consider their undergraduate education very important preparation for further education. 8 Furthermore, among graduates who majored in education or humanities as undergraduates, those who attained advanced degrees were more likely than those who did not to consider their undergraduate education very important preparation for their work and career. Those with undergraduate majors in education who held advanced degrees were more likely than their peers without graduate degrees to consider their undergraduate education very important preparation for their financial stability, whereas those who majored in health fields as undergraduates and attained advanced degrees were less likely to consider their college years very important preparation for their financial stability compared to health majors who had not completed a graduate degree."}, {"section_title": "Value of Undergraduate Education", "text": "Finally, the 1992-93 college graduates were asked to reevaluate their undergraduate education and decide whether they felt, 10 years later, that it was worth the financial cost, time, and effort required to obtain a bachelor's degree. Overall, the graduates evaluated their undergraduate education very favorably: at least 9 out of 10 felt it was worth the cost, time, and effort (90, 93, and 96 percent, respectively; table 8). Three percent, however, did not feel that their college years had been worth any of these investments. Despite the high overall evaluation, there were a few differences in the percentage reporting that college was worth the financial cost by undergraduate major. College graduates who majored in health or engineering were more likely than those who majored in other fields except for business to say that their college education was worth its financial cost (94 vs. 85-91 percent).

For example, while 59 percent of bachelor's degree recipients with no further education said the quality of undergraduate instruction was very important, 71 percent of graduates with doctoral or first-professional degrees said so."}, {"section_title": "Marital Status", "text": "About two-thirds (68 percent) of 1992-93 college graduates were married in 2003, and 20 percent were single and had never been married 9 (table 9). Smaller percentages reported that they were divorced (6 percent), cohabiting (4 percent), separated (1 percent), or widowed (0.4 percent). Men were more likely than women to report that they were single (22 vs. 18 percent), while women were more likely than men to report that they were divorced (7 vs. 5 percent) or widowed (0.7 vs. 0.1 percent). These findings are consistent with earlier ones that women were more likely than men to have married by the time they completed a bachelor's degree or to have married in the first 4 years after completing college (Clune, Nu\u00f1ez, and Choy 2001). Differences in marital status by race/ethnicity 4 years after college completion (Clune, Nu\u00f1ez, and Choy 2001) also persisted to 2003. Ten years after college, Asian/Pacific Islander and Black, non-Hispanic, graduates were more likely than their White, non-Hispanic, 10 and Hispanic counterparts to be single (37 and 33 percent, respectively, vs. 18-19 percent). About one-half of Asian and Black graduates were married (54 and 52 percent, respectively), compared with 70 percent of White graduates and 65 percent of Hispanic graduates. Black and Hispanic graduates were more likely than Asian graduates to be divorced (9 percent each vs. 2 percent). As in earlier years (Clune, Nu\u00f1ez, and Choy 2001), pursuit of further education was associated with a lower likelihood of marriage. In 2003, compared with their peers who were not enrolled, graduates who were enrolled in a postsecondary program at that time were more likely to be single (25 vs. 20 percent) or divorced (10 vs. 6 percent) and less likely to be married (60 vs. 69 percent). In addition, 1992-93 graduates who had completed a doctoral or first-professional degree were more likely than other graduates to be single in 2003 (29 vs. 19-20 percent), and they were less likely to be married (61 vs. 68-69 percent). Doctoral and first-professional degree recipients were also less likely than other graduates to be divorced (3 vs. 6 percent). In 2003, 10 years after college completion, graduates who worked part time or were out of the labor force were less likely than other graduates to be single and never married (12 and 7 percent, respectively, vs. 22-31 percent). Conversely, graduates who worked part time or were out of the labor force were more likely than others to be married (78 and 87 percent, respectively, vs. 54-66 percent). These patterns may be related to the fact that women were more likely than men to work part time or be out of the labor force (see table 3). Finally, bachelor's degree recipients with salaries in the highest salary group were more likely than their peers who earned less to be married in 2003 (72 vs. 66 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Parenthood", "text": "When they completed college in 1992-93, 14 percent of this cohort already had children; among those who did not already have children, 13 percent had become parents within 4 years (Clune, Nu\u00f1ez, and Choy 2001). Ten years after college completion, about one-half (51 percent) of graduates had children 11 younger than age 18 (table 10): 21 percent had one child, 22 percent had two children, and 9 percent had three or more children. Clune, Nu\u00f1ez, and Choy (2001) showed that pursuing further education within 4 years of college completion was associated with delayed childbearing for this cohort. The parental status of graduates after 10 years reflects this result. While 43 percent of bachelor's degree recipients enrolled in postsecondary education in 2003 had children, 52 percent of graduates who were not currently enrolled had children. Further, the higher the degree that graduates had completed by 2003, the less likely they were to have children. For example, 53 percent of graduates who did not complete a degree beyond the bachelor's had children, compared with 39 percent of those who completed a doctoral or first-professional degree. Labor force participation was also associated with parental status. About two-thirds (64 percent) of graduates who were employed part time in a single job had children in 2003, as did three-fourths of those who were out of the labor force. In contrast, 48 percent of those who were employed full time in one job, 44 percent of those who had multiple jobs, and 40 percent of those who were unemployed had children. Furthermore, those who were out of the labor force were more likely than all others to have three or more children (19 vs. 7-11 percent). Occupation was associated with having children as well. Educators were generally more likely than those in other occupations to have children, and employees in research or other professional or technical occupations were less likely than others to have children. Finally, as might be expected, marital status was associated with having children under age 18. While 5 percent of bachelor's degree recipients who were single and had never been married had children, about two-thirds (65 percent) of bachelor's degree recipients who were married or living with a partner did so, as did 43 percent of bachelor's degree recipients who were separated, divorced, or widowed."}, {"section_title": "Community Service", "text": "Overall, nearly one-half (47 percent) of the 1992-93 graduate cohort reported in 2003 that they had participated in community service in the past year (table 11).

Also, 30 percent had been involved in other types of volunteer work with kids, such as coaching or mentoring, and 26 percent had volunteered to help with poverty or other neighborhood or community improvement programs. As of 2003, female college graduates were more likely than their male counterparts to have volunteered in the past year (50 vs. 43 percent; table 11). Among those who had volunteered, women were more likely than men to have served educational or religious institutions, while men were more likely than women to have done other volunteer work with children or to have addressed poverty or neighborhood improvement projects. These patterns are consistent with those found among 1999-2000 bachelor's degree recipients in 2001: at that time, women were more likely than men to have engaged in community service overall, as well as in tutoring or education-related volunteer work with children and youth, while men were more likely than women to have done other (non-education-related) volunteer work with children and youth (Bradburn et al. 2003).

Employees of for-profit businesses were less likely than graduates working for themselves, for not-for-profit organizations, or for local or state government to have volunteered in the past year (42 vs. 49-53 percent). Federal government employees were also less likely than state or local civil servants to have volunteered (43 vs. 53 percent). Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who had volunteered in the past year as of 2003, those who were single were less likely than others to have volunteered to work with children or for a religious institution. However, no difference by marital status in the overall proportion who had volunteered was detected. Similarly, among those who had volunteered at all in the past year, college graduates with dependents under age 18 in 2003 were more likely than those without dependents to have done educational volunteer work, other work with kids, or volunteer work for a religious institution. Yet there was no detectable difference in graduates' overall likelihood of volunteering by whether or not they had dependents. Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who had volunteered in the past year as of 2003, 27 percent reported that they had done so less than once a month, 29 percent had done so monthly, and 34 percent had done so weekly (table 12). On average, the total amount of time volunteers had logged in that period was 148 hours. Although women were more likely than men to have volunteered in the past year, among those who had volunteered, men were more likely to have done so on a daily basis (10 vs. 6 percent), while women were more likely to have volunteered less than once a month (31 vs. 22 percent).

Further, while about one-fifth of unemployed graduates (40 percent) or those who were out of the labor force (42 percent) volunteered less than once a month, one-fourth of those who were employed did so (25 percent). Despite volunteering more frequently, however, employed graduates had done fewer total hours of volunteer work during the past year than their counterparts who were unemployed or out of the labor force (141 vs. 253 and 175 hours, respectively). Whether or not graduates were married or had children was also related to the frequency of their community service.

Volunteers who had children younger than age 18 were more likely than their counterparts without children to have done community service less than once a month (31 vs. 24 percent), and they were less likely to have volunteered weekly (31 vs. 37 percent) or daily (6 vs. 10 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Political Participation", "text": "About 9 out of 10 (93 percent) of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients were registered to vote in 2003, and a majority (76 percent) had voted in the 2002 election (table 13). 12 These rates of registration and voting were similar to those of 1999-2000 graduates: 87 percent were registered to vote in 2001, and 77 percent had voted in the 2000 presidential election. 13 Among the 1992-93 graduates, activities that required more involvement were less common: about one-third (36 percent) had contacted a public official by letter, e-mail, or telephone in the past 2 years, while 15 percent had attended some sort of political event, such as a dinner or a rally, in the past year. Asian/Pacific Islander and Hispanic graduates were less likely than their Black and White counterparts to be registered to vote in 2003, to have voted in the 2002 elections, or to have attended political events in the past year. There was one exception to this overall pattern: no difference was detected between Hispanic and White graduates in the percentage attending political events. Older 1992-93 college graduates were more likely than younger ones to have voted in the 2002 elections. While 73 percent of those who graduated at age 22 or younger had voted, 89 percent of those who were age 30 or older when graduating had done so. Older bachelor's degree recipients were also more likely than their younger peers to have contacted a public official in the past 2 years: about one-half (49 percent) of graduates age 30 or older at college completion had done so, compared with approximately one-third (33-36 percent) of younger graduates. Both educational expectations at college completion and eventual educational attainment were associated with various forms of political participation. When interviewed in 2003, mem- bers of the 1992-93 cohort who expected at the time of graduation to complete a doctoral or first-professional degree were more likely than those who did not have such expectations to have contacted a public official in the past 2 years or to have attended political events in the past year. When comparing graduates by the actual level of education they had completed by 2003, having an advanced degree was also sometimes associated with more political participation. Graduates who had completed an advanced degree by 2003 were more likely than those with no more than a bachelor's degree to have attended political events in the past year (19-24 percent vs. 13 percent). Furthermore, master's degree recipients were more likely than graduates with a bachelor's degree to have contacted a public official in the past 2 years (41 vs. 35 percent). However, doctoral and first-professional degree holders were less likely than master's degree holders to have voted in the 2002 national election (70 vs. 78 percent). Although 1992-93 college graduates took many different paths after earning bachelor's degrees, some paths were more common than others. By 2003, 20 percent of graduates had earned master's degrees, 4 percent had earned first-professional degrees, and 2 percent had earned doctoral degrees. Advanced degree program attendance and completion were associated with a number of undergraduate factors, such as major field of study and GPA. Also, the extent to which graduates enrolled in graduate and professional education programs corresponded with their plans upon earning a bachelor's degree: those who had anticipated earning an advanced degree were more likely to do so than those who had not expected to further their education. Most bachelor's degree recipients were employed 10 years after graduating from college, and 70 percent were employed in one full-time job. The average full-time employee worked 47 hours per week and earned $60,700 per year. Ten years after graduating from college, the median salary for graduates who worked full time was $52,000. Gender differences were evident in graduates' careers. For example, men were more likely to work full time than women, while women were more likely to work part time or to be out of the labor force than men. Employment outcomes were also related to highest degree attained, occupation, and other characteristics. Overall, 1992-93 college graduates seemed to be pleased with their experiences while they were undergraduates. Although their evaluation varied across the specific aspects of their undergraduate education (such as their liberal arts coursework and internship or work opportunities), most agreed that their undergraduate education as a whole was very important preparation for their work and career, further education, and for establishing financial security. Finally, regardless of major, most bachelor's degree recipients felt that their undergraduate education was worth the financial cost, amount of time, and amount of effort they had invested in it. The majority of bachelor's degree recipients (68 percent) were married in 2003, and about half (51 percent) had children under 18 years old. The likelihood of being married varied by graduates' demographic characteristics, and pursuing a graduate degree was associated with a reduced likelihood of both being married and having children, a result consistent with earlier findings that graduate school enrollment delayed family formation (Clune, Nu\u00f1ez, and Choy 2001). Community service, a recent focus in postsecondary education, was common among the graduates 10 years later. In 2003, nearly half (47 percent) of them reported having volunteered within the last year. Political participation was also evident. The majority of graduates were registered to vote, and nearly three-fourths reported that they had voted in the 2002 election. Graduates reported that they were less likely to have contacted a public official to express an opinion or to have attended political events than they were to have voted. However, those who had attained a doctoral or first-professional degree by 2003 were generally more likely to have participated in these activities than those who had earned a master's or bachelor's degree.

No difference was detected between graduates age 30 or older and those age 23-24 in the likelihood of enrolling in a graduate degree program. \u2022 Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients, those who graduated from private not-forprofit institutions were more likely than those who graduated from public institutions to have enrolled in or completed a graduate program. Forty-five percent of those who completed a bachelor's degree at a private not-for-profit 4-year institution had enrolled in a graduate program, compared with 38 percent of those from public 4-year institutions. \u2022 Two-thirds of bachelor's degree recipients employed by the military had enrolled in a graduate program, more than the proportion that had enrolled in a graduate program among those working for not-for-profit organizations (48 percent), for-profit firms (31 percent), or those who were self-employed (33 percent). \u2022 Educators, health professionals, and research/technical professionals were more likely than college graduates in other occupations to have enrolled in or completed a graduate program. Educators were also more likely than those in other occupations to be currently enrolled in a graduate program as of 2003. \u2022 Graduates with higher salaries were more likely to have enrolled in an advanced degree program than those with lower salaries. For example, 34 percent of those in the lowest salary group (the bottom 25 percent; see appendix A for more information) had enrolled in a graduate program, compared with 42 percent of middle and 44 percent of high earners. However, bachelor's degree recipients in the lowest salary group were more likely than those with higher salaries to report being currently enrolled in 2003 (8 vs. 4-6 percent).  \u2022 Among bachelor's degree recipients who enrolled in a graduate program, those who took longer to complete the bachelor's degree were less likely to have completed an advanced degree and more likely to have left a graduate program without completing it. For example, 19 percent of those who completed a bachelor's degree in 4 years had left graduate school without completing it, compared with 29 percent of those who took more than 6 years to finish a bachelor's degree. \u2022 Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who enrolled in a graduate program, nearly two-thirds of those who were employed full time (66 percent) and those who had multiple jobs (63 percent) had completed a graduate program by 2003. These groups were more likely than those who worked part time or were unemployed or out of the labor force to have completed an advanced degree program. \u2022 Among 1992-93 college graduates who enrolled in graduate school, those working in health and in research and other professional and technical occupations were more likely than those in business, education, service industries, engineering, architecture, or computer science, and other unspecified occupations to have completed a graduate program. \u2022 Whether or not bachelor's degree recipients had children was related to their likelihood of having completed a graduate program. Among those who had enrolled, parents were less likely to have completed a program and more likely to have left without completing it."}, {"section_title": "Table I.3", "text": "\u2022 In the decade since completing college, about one-fourth (26 percent) of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients had earned an advanced degree. Twenty percent had earned a master's degree, 4 percent had earned a first-professional degree, and 2 percent had earned a doctoral degree. \u2022 Younger bachelor's degree recipients (age 22 or younger when they earned a bachelor's degree) were more likely than those in other age groups to have earned an advanced degree, whether it was a master's, first-professional, or doctoral degree. \u2022 Graduates who completed a bachelor's degree in 4 years or less were more likely than those who took longer for undergraduate education to have completed a master's, doctoral, or firstprofessional degree. \u2022 Graduates of private not-for-profit 4-year institutions were more likely than their counterparts at public 4-year or other institutions to have earned a first-professional degree (5 vs. 2-3 percent). \u2022 About one-fourth (26 percent) of graduates who worked in multiple jobs in 2003 had earned a master's degree. This was higher than for those who worked in one full-time job (20 percent), were unemployed (11 percent), or were out of the labor force (14 percent). \u2022 Bachelor's degree recipients employed by not-for-profit organizations, the government, or the military were more likely than self-employed graduates and those working in for-profit companies to have earned a master's degree. Not-for-profit and government employees were also more likely than for-profit employees or the self-employed to have earned a doctoral degree. \u2022 Compared with bachelor's degree recipients with higher salaries, those in the lowest salary group were less likely to have earned a master's, first-professional, or doctoral degree. \u2022 Bachelor's degree recipients who were single were more likely than others to have earned a first-professional degree (6 vs. 3-4 percent). \u2022 Those graduates who had no children were more likely than those with children to hold a doctoral or first-professional degree in 2003. Table I.4 \u2022 Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who earned advanced degrees between 1997 and 2003, 14 20 percent had earned a master's degree in business administration, 16 percent had earned a master's degree in education, and 38 percent had earned a master's degree in other fields. Additionally, 7 percent each had earned a law degree or degree in medicine, 2 percent had earned a degree in other first-professional fields, and 5 percent each had earned a Ph.D. or other doctoral degree. \u2022 Men were more likely than women to have earned a master's degree in business administration, a degree in medicine, a PhD, and other types of doctoral degrees. However, women were more likely than men to have earned a master's in education and master's degrees in other fields. \u2022 Asian/Pacific Islander students were more likely than Black, White, or Hispanic students to have earned a degree in medicine. 15 \u2022 Graduates who were 22 or younger when they earned a bachelor's degree were more likely than their older counterparts to have earned a degree in medicine. On the other hand, those in the oldest age group (30 or older) were more likely than those in the youngest age group to have earned a master's in education. \u2022 Thirty-four percent of advanced degree holders in the highest salary group had earned a master's degree in business administration, compared with 14 percent in the middle group and 12 percent in the lowest group. About 9 percent of advanced degree holders in the highest salary group had earned a degree in law, while 5 percent in the middle earnings group had done so. Those in the highest salary group were more likely than those with lower salaries to have earned a degree in medicine or some other first-professional degree. Finally, 7 percent of advanced degree holders in the highest salary group had earned a doctoral degree other than a Ph.D., compared with 2 percent in the lowest group. \u2022 Whereas those without dependents younger than age 18 were more likely than those with children to have earned their advanced degree in law, parents were more likely to have earned a master's degree in education. Table I.5 \u2022 Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients with advanced degrees, men were more likely than women to have earned that degree in business and management or in science, mathematics, or engineering, while women were more likely than men to have earned such a degree in education or in the social and behavioral sciences. \u2022 Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients with advanced degrees, 36 percent of Asian graduates had earned that degree in health, compared with 12 percent of White graduates and 8 percent each of Black and Hispanic graduates. \u2022 Compared with graduates who took 4 years or less to complete a bachelor's degree, those who took more than 6 years to complete that degree were more likely to have earned an advanced degree in business and management or in education. \u2022 About one-third (34 percent) of advanced degree holders who were employed by for-profit companies had earned an advanced degree in business and management, compared with 15 percent who were self-employed, 16 percent who worked for not-for-profit agencies, and 11 percent who worked for local or state governments. About one-fourth (26 percent) of those who worked for local or state governments had earned their advanced degree in education, a greater proportion than those working in other sectors. \u2022 Greater proportions of advanced degree holders who worked for not-for-profit agencies had earned their advanced degree in arts and humanities than those in other employment sectors (excluding the self-employed). Those who were employed by the federal government were more likely than those working for other employers besides the military to hold their advanced degree in science, mathematics, or engineering."}, {"section_title": "Table I.6", "text": "\u2022 Among 1992-93 college graduates with advanced degrees, 47 percent had received student loans for their graduate education; 28 percent had received grants, scholarships, or fellowships; 12 percent had tuition waived; 11 percent had received teaching assistantships; 9 percent had received research assistantships; and 18 percent had been reimbursed for tuition by their employers. \u2022 Among bachelor's degree recipients who attained a master's, doctoral, or first-professional degree, men were more likely than women to have received a teaching or research assistantship. \u2022 Advanced degree holders who were age 30 or older when they earned a bachelor's degree were less likely than younger students to have taken out student loans for their graduate education. Graduates age 30 or older at baccalaureate degree completion were also less likely than those who were age 24 or younger to have received a teaching or research assistantship. However, these older graduates were more likely than those who were 24 or younger to have tuition reimbursed by their employer. \u2022 Two-thirds (67 percent) of bachelor's degree recipients employed in health after earning an advanced degree had received student loans, a larger proportion than those working in any other occupation. \u2022 Advanced degree holders with dependents under age 18 in 2003 were less likely than those without children to have received student loans, grants, tuition waivers, or research assistantships to fund their graduate education. Table I.7 \u2022 Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients, 2 percent had enrolled in a diploma/certificate program, 2 percent in an associate's degree program, and 6 percent in a second bachelor's degree program within 10 years of graduation. Of those who had enrolled in these undergraduate programs, 59 percent completed a certificate or degree by 2003. \u2022 A greater proportion of women than men had enrolled in an additional bachelor's degree program after earning their first bachelor's in 1992-93. \u2022 Students who were ages 23-24 when they earned a bachelor's degree in 1992-93 were more likely than those who were 22 or younger and those who were 30 or older to have enrolled in an additional bachelor's degree program (7 vs. 5 percent each). \u2022 Among college graduates who entered subsequent undergraduate programs, a higher proportion of students who majored in education for their 1992-93 bachelor's degree had completed a subsequent certificate or degree than those who majored in business, arts and humanities, social and behavioral sciences, or other unspecified fields. \u2022 Bachelor's degree recipients who were out of the labor force were not as likely as those who were working to have enrolled in an additional bachelor's degree program. \u2022 Health professionals were generally more likely than graduates working in most other occupations to have enrolled in an associate's or second bachelor's degree program after completing a first bachelor's degree in 1992-93. \u2022 Of graduates who enrolled in a subsequent undergraduate program, 74 percent of educators had completed that program, a greater proportion than those in any other occupation except health. \u2022 Compared with college graduates with lower earnings, those who were in the highest salary group were less likely to have enrolled in an associate's or bachelor's degree program. Those who were in the highest salary group were also less likely than those in the lowest salary group to have enrolled in a diploma or certificate program. \u2022 Women were more likely than men to have enrolled in a professional certification program (32 vs. 28 percent), work-related classes (46 vs. 43 percent), and personal enrichment classes (22 vs. 13 percent). \u2022 A greater proportion of college graduates who were age 30 or older when they earned a bachelor's degree than those who were age 24 or younger had enrolled in a professional certification program since that time. This trend was also evident in more recent personal enrichment coursetaking: about 22 percent of graduates age 30 or older had taken personal enrichment courses in the past year, compared with 18 percent who were 22 or younger and 17 percent who were 23-24. \u2022 Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients, those who majored in health as undergraduates (36 percent) were generally more likely than those with other majors to have enrolled in an occupational license program since then. Along with education majors, health majors were also generally more likely than others to have enrolled in a professional certification program in that time. \u2022 Compared with those who were employed in other fields, graduates who worked in the health field were more likely to have enrolled in an occupational license program within 10 years of college completion, and those in education were more likely to have enrolled in a professional certification program.                        Hispanic origin unless specified. Included in the totals but not shown separately are data for American Indian/Alaska Native respondents and those who identified themselves with another race not shown.     \u2022 Graduates with undergraduate majors in engineering were more likely to be employed in one full-time job 10 years after college graduation than those with any other baccalaureate majors (85 percent vs. 55-77 percent). Those who majored in health were generally less likely than those who majored in other subjects to be employed full time in one job after 10 years. \u2022 Overall, 4 percent of 1992-93 college graduates were unemployed; health majors were less likely to be unemployed than undergraduate majors in business, engineering, humanities, social science, or natural sciences and mathematics. \u2022 College graduates from 1992-93 who were employed currently or most recently by the military were more likely to work full time at one job in 2003 (83 percent) than those who were currently or most recently self-employed (59 percent), employed by a not-for-profit organization (61 percent), and those who had been employed by local or state government (64 percent). \u2022 Single graduates who had never married were more likely than other graduates to work full time 17 (76 vs. 67-69 percent). \u2022 College graduates from 1992-93 who had no dependents younger than age 18 were more likely to be employed full time than graduates with dependents (75 percent of graduates without dependents and 66 percent of those with dependents worked full time). Ten percent of graduates with no dependents and 8 percent with dependents worked multiple jobs."}, {"section_title": "Table II.2", "text": "\u2022 Among college graduates who were employed in 2003, men worked more hours per week than women, on average, both in full-time jobs (49 vs. 45 hours) and in multiple jobs (59 vs. 49 hours). \u2022 Across racial/ethnic groups, 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients with one full-time job worked an average of 45-48 hours per week. \u2022 Employed college graduates with an undergraduate major in health worked fewer hours per week in one full-time job (about 45 hours) than those with most other majors, who averaged 47-49 hours per week; an exception was those with a public affairs major, who worked about 44 hours per week. \u2022 Compared with full-time workers who had bachelor's or master's degrees, doctoral or firstprofessional degree recipients worked about 7 hours more per week. Those with doctoral or first-professional degrees worked about 54 hours per week in one full-time job, on average, while college graduates whose highest degree was a master's or a bachelor's degree worked about 47 hours each. Graduates who worked in multiple jobs in 2003 and whose highest level of education was a master's degree worked fewer hours than others, averaging about 50 hours per week, compared with 55-56 hours for those whose highest degree was a bachelor's, doctoral, or first-professional degree. \u2022 In contrast to the differences by baccalaureate major, graduates with an advanced degree in health worked nearly one work day more per week in one full-time job than advanced degree holders in other fields. Specifically, those whose highest degree was in health worked an average of 56 hours per week, while those who studied arts and humanities or other unspecified fields for their highest degree averaged 49 hours per week and those in business and management, education, and in science, mathematics, or engineering worked 47-48 hours per week. Full-time workers who studied social and behavioral sciences for their advanced degree worked fewer hours per week than others, about 43 hours. \u2022 Recipients of bachelor's degrees in 1992-93 who worked full time for the military or for themselves worked more hours per week than their counterparts employed in the for-profit and not-for-profit sectors or by the government. \u2022 Occupation followed a pattern similar to that seen for field of advanced degree. Health professionals worked more hours per week, on average, in one full-time job than those in most other occupations, who worked 46-47 hours per week, on average. However, no difference was detected between professionals in health and those in business and management in average weekly hours. \u2022 Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who were employed in one full-time job, average hours worked per week were higher for those with higher salaries. Those in the lowest salary group worked 45 hours per week, the middle group worked 46 hours, and those in the highest group worked 50 hours. Table II.3 \u2022 Overall, the largest proportion of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who were employed in 2003 (30 percent) worked in business and management occupations. Between 17 and 18 percent worked as educators or in research or other professional/technical occupations, 10 percent in engineering, architecture, or computer science, 9 percent each worked in health or in service industries, and the remaining 7 percent were employed in some other occupation. 18 \u2022 Gender differences were apparent for those working in business (34 percent of men vs. 27 percent of women), education (9 percent of men vs. 26 percent of women), health (6 percent of men vs. 12 percent of women), and engineering, architecture, or computer science (16 percent of men vs. 4 percent of women). \u2022 Asians were less likely to be employed as educators than Black, White, or Hispanic graduates (7 vs. 18-21 percent), and were more likely than those from other racial/ethnic groups to be employed as engineers, architects, or computer scientists (18 vs. 8-10 percent). \u2022 Several baccalaureate majors were reflected in graduates' occupations 10 years later. Among undergraduates with business majors, 59 percent worked in business and management after 10 years. The majority of education majors (66 percent) worked as educators, and the majority of health majors (63 percent) worked as health professionals. Finally, 58 percent of undergraduate engineering majors worked in engineering, architecture, or computer science in 2003. \u2022 About one-third of graduates whose highest degree was a bachelor's degree worked in business and management 10 years later; bachelor's degree recipients were more likely than master's or doctoral degree recipients to work in this professional field. Graduates whose highest level of education was a bachelor's degree were also more likely than those with master's, doctoral, or first-professional degrees to work in service industries (11 vs. 2-4 percent) or in engineering, architecture, or computer science (11 vs. 3-8 percent). Graduates with master's degrees were more likely than those with bachelor's degrees or those with doctoral or firstprofessional degrees to work as educators (35 vs. 11-14 percent), and those with doctoral or first-professional degrees were more likely to work as health professionals (36 vs. 7-8 percent) or in research or other professional or technical occupations (40 vs. 15-17 percent) than graduates with bachelor's or master's degrees. \u2022 Advanced degree field was related to occupation in ways similar to baccalaureate major. For instance, 65 percent of graduates with an advanced degree in business and management worked in business and management in 2003. Eighty-four percent of those with education degrees worked in education, and 77 percent of those with advanced degrees in health worked as health professionals. Table II.4 \u2022 The largest proportion (58 percent) of employed 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients worked in the for-profit sector. Another 17 percent worked for a not-for-profit employer, 11 percent worked for local or state government, 10 percent were self-employed, 3 percent were employed by the federal government, and 1 percent were employed by the military. \u2022 College graduates whose highest degree was a bachelor's degree were more likely to be employed by a for-profit company than those who had earned a master's, doctoral, or first-professional degree and were less likely to be employed in the not-for-profit sector or by local or state government. \u2022 Bachelor's degree recipients who worked in one part-time job 10 years later were more likely to be self-employed than those who worked full time or had multiple jobs (23 vs. 8-14 percent). Table II.5 \u2022 Among college graduates who were employed in 2003, those who worked full time had a mean salary of $60,700. Part-time workers averaged $41,300, and workers with multiple jobs averaged $48,200. \u2022 Among full-time employees, White graduates had higher average salaries than Black graduates ($61,200 vs. $53,500). \u2022 Although graduates' average salaries for one full-time job varied considerably by type of employer, self-employed graduates and those employed by a for-profit company earned more on average than others at $76,100 and $68,400 per year, respectively. The median salaries are somewhat lower, suggesting that a few very high salaries may have increased the mean. The median salary for those who were self-employed, worked for a for-profit firm, or were in the military was $60,000 per year. Table II.6 \u2022 The majority of employed college graduates reported having flexible scheduling options (77 percent) or supervisory duties (59 percent) at their jobs. In addition, 43 percent said that they participated in hiring and firing decisions, over one-fourth (28 percent) reported that telecommuting was allowed in their jobs, and 23 percent participated in setting pay for other employees. \u2022 Most employed college graduates (88 percent) reported in 2003 that they considered the job in which they were employed 10 years after attaining a bachelor's degree to be a part of their career. \u2022 Among employed graduates, men were more likely than women to supervise others (66 vs. 53 percent), assist in hiring and firing decisions (50 vs. 36 percent), set pay for others (29 vs. 17 percent), and consider their job a part of their career (91 vs. 85 percent). \u2022 Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who were employed in 2003, those with doctoral or first-professional degrees were less likely than graduates whose highest degree was a bachelor's or master's degree to be able to telecommute or to have flexible scheduling. However, doctoral or first-professional degree recipients were more likely than bachelor's or master's degree recipients to have supervisory duties (73 vs. 56-59 percent). Bachelor's degree recipients were more likely than master's, doctoral, or first-professional recipients to set pay for others (24 vs. 18-19 percent). They were less likely to report that their job in 2003 was a part of their career (86 vs. 92-93 percent). \u2022 College graduates who were employed full time in one job were more likely than part-time workers to have supervisory responsibilities, assist in hiring and firing decisions, set pay for others, and to say that their jobs were part of their career. \u2022 College graduates who worked in the for-profit sector were more likely than their peers in the not-for-profit sector, government, or the military to be allowed to telecommute. Those in the for-profit sector were also more likely than those working in local or state government and in the military to have their employers offer them flexible scheduling options. Bachelor's degree recipients from 1992-93 who worked for the federal government in 2003 were generally less likely than graduates employed in the for-profit, not-for-profit, or military sectors to have any supervisory responsibilities and to assist in hiring and firing decisions. \u2022 Graduates who worked in engineering, architecture, or computer science in 2003 were more likely than those who worked in any other occupation except service industries to be able to telecommute (41 vs. 12-31 percent) and were more likely than graduates in other occupations except business and management to be allowed flexible scheduling at work (85 vs. 64-79 percent). \u2022 Graduates' salaries were related to the degree of flexibility and responsibility they experienced at their jobs. The higher their salary, the more likely they were to be able to telecommute, to be allowed a flexible schedule, to supervise others, to assist in hiring and firing decisions, to set pay for others, and to report that their current job was a part of their career. Table II.7 \u2022 About 9 out of 10 employed college graduates (91 percent) received medical insurance through their employers 10 years after completing a bachelor's degree, and 85 percent received retirement benefits. Eighty-three percent received some other form of health insurance (dental, optical, or some other health benefit), and over three-fourths (78 percent) received life insurance through their employers. Finally, 47 percent had flexible spending accounts, and 13 percent had access to a childcare facility or received a childcare subsidy from their employers. \u2022 Men were generally more likely than women to receive job benefits, except for having access to a childcare facility or receiving a childcare subsidy. \u2022 Having earned a higher degree did not necessarily correspond to additional benefits at work. In fact, doctoral or first-professional degree recipients were less likely than their peers with bachelor's or master's degrees to receive life insurance and retirement benefits through their employers (67 percent of doctoral or first-professional recipients received life insurance vs. 77 and 79 percent, respectively, of master's and bachelor's degree recipients; and 76 percent received retirement benefits, compared with 86 percent each of bachelor's and master's degree recipients). \u2022 As might be expected, 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who were employed in one fulltime job were more likely to receive most benefits than those who worked in multiple jobs or worked in one part-time job, although no difference was detected between the percentage of full-and part-time employees who received child care benefits. Bachelor's degree recipients who held multiple jobs in 2003, however, were more likely than part-time workers to receive many benefits, except flexible spending accounts and child care subsidies. \u2022 All graduates employed by the military received medical insurance, and nearly all (99 percent) reported that they received other health insurance as well. At least 9 out of 10 graduates employed by the federal government or the military received life insurance and retirement benefits from their employers. About half (53 percent) of graduates employed by the military and one-fourth (27 percent) of those employed by the federal government had access to a childcare facility or received a childcare subsidy, making graduates employed by both sectors generally more likely than other graduates to receive this type of benefit. \u2022 College graduates employed in engineering, architecture, or computer science in 2003 were more likely to have medical insurance, other health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits than graduates working in all other occupations. Health professionals (20 percent) were generally more likely than those in other occupations to receive childcare benefits through their employers (11-15 percent of graduates employed in other occupations). \u2022 Higher salaries generally corresponded to a higher likelihood of receiving various job benefits. Employed graduates in the middle salary group were more likely than those with lower earnings to receive all types of benefits with the exception of access to childcare facilities or subsidies. Those with the highest salaries were more likely than those with middle salaries to receive other health insurance, life insurance, retirement benefits, flexible spending accounts, and childcare benefits. Table II.8 \u2022 In 2003, 10 years after they earned a bachelor's degree, about 4 percent of bachelor's degree recipients were unemployed (not working, but looking for work). Of those, 10 percent were receiving unemployment compensation. Among all those who had been unemployed at any time since 1997, the average amount of time spent unemployed was about 8 months. \u2022 Men who were unemployed in 2003 were more likely than women to be receiving unemployment compensation. Of those who were unemployed, 30 percent of men were receiving unemployment compensation, compared with 5 percent of women. \u2022 Black graduates who were unemployed were more likely than their fellow unemployed college graduates who were Asian, White, or Hispanic to be receiving unemployment compensation. About one-third of Black graduates reported receiving unemployment, compared with 6-9 percent of Asian, White, and Hispanic graduates. However, Hispanic graduates reported that they had spent an average of 10 months unemployed since 1997, while Black graduates reported spending an average of 7 months unemployed. \u2022 Graduates whose highest degree was a bachelor's degree were more likely than those who had earned master's, doctoral, or first-professional degrees to be unemployed in 2003 (4 vs. 2 percent). \u2022 Educators were less likely than those who worked in research or other professional or technical occupations and those who worked in engineering, architecture, or computer science to be unemployed in 2003 (2 vs. 5-6 percent). Of those who were unemployed, educators were less likely than those in most other occupations to be receiving unemployment compensation. Two percent of unemployed educators were receiving unemployment compensation, compared with 10-42 percent of those in business and management, service industries, research, and engineering, architecture, or computer science.               "}, {"section_title": "Table III.2", "text": "\u2022 A higher undergraduate GPA was associated with a higher likelihood of reporting that earning a bachelor's degree was very important preparation for work and career and for further education. For example, 84 percent of graduates with an undergraduate GPA of 3.75 or higher reported that the bachelor's degree they earned was very important preparation for their work and career, compared with 76 percent of graduates with a GPA of less than 2.75. \u2022 Graduates who earned bachelor's degrees from private not-for-profit institutions were more likely than those who graduated from public institutions to report that the degree was very important preparation for further education. \u2022 Among bachelor's degree recipients, those who expected to earn higher degrees were more likely than those who had lower educational expectations to report that the bachelor's degree was very important preparation for further education. For students who expected to earn a doctoral or first-professional degree, 93 percent reported that the bachelor's degree they had earned in 1992-93 was very important preparation for further education, compared with 39 percent of students who expected to earn no higher than a bachelor's degree. Table III.3 \u2022 Graduates with a higher undergraduate GPA were more likely than those with lower grades to report that earning a bachelor's degree was worth the financial cost. For students with a GPA of 3.75 or higher, 93 percent reported that the bachelor's degree they had earned was worth the financial cost, compared with 89 percent of students with a GPA of less than 2.75. \u2022 A higher proportion of graduates who earned a bachelor's degree from a public institution than those who earned a bachelor's degree from a private not-for-profit institution reported that the degree was worth the financial cost. \u2022 Graduates who took longer to complete a bachelor's were more likely than those who took less time obtaining the degree to report that earning the degree was worth the financial cost. For example, 92 percent of those who took more than 6 years to complete a bachelor's degree reported that the degree was worth the financial cost, compared with 89 percent who completed in 4 years or less. \u2022 Compared with those who were currently enrolled in 2003, those not currently enrolled were more likely to report that earning a bachelor's degree was worth the effort it took to do so. However, those who had ever enrolled in graduate school were more likely than those who had not enrolled to say their undergraduate education was worth the amount of time and effort it took. \u2022 Graduates with more education were more likely than those with less education to report that a bachelor's degree was worth the amount of time and effort required to earn the degree. For example, 98 percent of graduates who earned a doctoral or first-professional degree indicated that earning a bachelor's degree was worth the effort required, compared with 95 percent of graduates who did not complete an advanced degree. Table III.4 \u2022 Over one-third of college graduates reported in 2003 that the highest degree they expected to earn was a bachelor's degree or a postbaccalaureate certificate. Forty-four percent of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients expected their highest degree to be a master's degree or a post-master's certificate, 6 percent expected a first-professional degree, and 12 percent expected a doctoral degree. \u2022 College graduates' degree expectations after attaining a bachelor's degree in 1992-93 were generally consistent with their expectations 10 years later in 2003: 68 percent of bachelor's degree recipients who had anticipated that their highest degree would be a bachelor's degree in 1992-93 still believed it would be their highest degree in 2003. Among those who expected upon college completion in 1992-93 to earn a master's degree eventually, about half reported in 2003 that they still expected their highest degree to be a master's; however, 39 percent had lowered their expectations in 2003 and no longer expected to attain a degree higher than a bachelor's. More bachelor's degree recipients who expected to earn doctoral or first-professional degrees had lowered their expectations by 2003: 17 percent no longer expected to earn a degree higher than a bachelor's, and 38 percent expected to earn no degree higher than a master's. However, 15 percent still expected to earn a first-professional degree, and 30 percent anticipated attaining a doctoral degree. \u2022 Educational expectations in 2003 varied by occupation as well. Educators were less likely than those in other occupations to expect that the highest degree they would ultimately attain would be a bachelor's, while those employed in service industries were more likely to have this expectation, with the exception of those employed in other unspecified occupations. Table III.5 \u2022 Overall, bachelor's degree recipients who had completed advanced degrees were very satisfied with their graduate education. 19 Seventy-one percent were very satisfied with the faculty and the teaching, 70 percent were very satisfied with the course offerings, and 64 percent were very satisfied with the availability of courses.

About two-fifths (40 percent) had taken paid leave, averaging 2.5 months. \u2022 In 2003, 1992-93 college graduates who had been out of the labor force or worked part time at any time since 1997 were asked whether a variety of factors, including childrearing and family care, were reasons for their lower level of labor force participation. Overall, 79 percent of those who had been out of the labor force indicated that raising a family was one reason for not working, and 64 percent of those who had worked part time reported the same. \u2022 While 27 percent of men had taken leave and 24 percent had taken paid leave for childrearing, two-thirds (67 percent) of women had taken leave and about half (54 percent) had taken paid leave. Men had taken shorter periods of leave than women as well. \u2022 Parents who worked part time or were out of the labor force in 2003 were generally more likely than others to have taken leave for childrearing at some point since 1997. About threefourths (73 percent) of part-time employees had taken leave, as had 62 percent of those who were out of the labor force in 2003. Part-time workers were also more likely than others to have taken paid leave from work. \u2022 Among parents who had taken leave, those who were employed full time at one job in 2003 had taken shorter periods of leave than others. Those who were out of the labor force in 2003 had taken the longest leave, an average of 19 months (compared with 11 months or less for other groups). \u2022 Parents who were self-employed or worked in the for-profit sector were less likely than those in not-for-profit organizations, local or state government, or federal government to have taken leave from work for childrearing, and the self-employed were less likely than all other employed parents to have taken paid leave. Federal government employees were more likely than for-profit or not-for-profit employees to have taken paid leave (59 vs. 38 and 42 percent, respectively). \u2022 About 73 percent of college graduates with children were saving money for their children's education in 2003. The most commonly used savings vehicle was a traditional savings account (50 percent), followed by money market accounts, state-sponsored savings plans, and Roth IRAs (ranging from 21-24 percent each). Less commonly used were certificates of deposit (12 percent) and tuition prepayment plans (7 percent). About three in ten (31 percent) graduates had their children's education savings in some other form. \u2022 As their age at bachelor's degree completion increased, the percentage of graduates with savings for their children's education decreased, from 75 percent of those 22 or younger to 66 percent of those 30 or older when they completed a bachelor's degree. \u2022 Parents who graduated from private not-for-profit institutions were less likely than others to be saving for their children's education (69 percent). Graduates of public 4-year institutions (74 percent) and graduates of other institutions (90 percent) were more likely to have such savings. \u2022 Graduates working in business and management were more likely than average to have any savings for their children's education. Eighty percent of graduates working in a businessrelated job were saving for their children's education, compared with 73 percent of all employed graduates. \u2022 About three-fourths (74 percent) of married graduates who were parents were saving money for their children's education, compared with 60-61 percent of parents who were separated, divorced, widowed, or never married. \u2022 About 77 percent of those who earned a bachelor's degree at public 4-year institutions owned a home, a rate that exceeded the 70 percent of those who graduated from private not-for-profit institutions. No difference was detected between the percentages of graduates of public universities and of graduates of other types of institutions (69 percent) who owned homes, however. \u2022 The home ownership rate declined as educational attainment increased. A higher proportion of college graduates with no further degree owned a home than those had obtained doctoral or first-professional degrees (76 vs. 59 percent). \u2022 Graduates who were unemployed (47 percent) were less likely than others to own a home, while those who were out of the labor force (83 percent) were more likely than others to do so. In between these two groups were graduates who had multiple jobs (69 percent), those who worked full time at a single job (75 percent), and those who worked part time at a single job (75 percent). \u2022 Graduates who were unemployed in 2003 were more likely to neither own nor rent a home than those working full time or part time at a single job (12 vs. 3 percent). The unemployed were also more likely to neither own nor rent than graduates who were out of the labor force (3 percent). \u2022 A majority of married or cohabiting graduates owned a home (86 percent), a larger proportion than among those who were separated, divorced, or widowed (58 percent) or single (39 percent). Single graduates were more likely than others to neither own nor rent. \u2022 Ten years after completing a bachelor's degree, 35 percent of graduates lived in the South, 23 percent each in the Northeast and Midwest, 18 percent in the West, and 1 percent in outlying areas or other countries. \u2022 The four regions of the United States had varying proportions of graduates from different racial/ethnic backgrounds. For example, about one-half of Asian/Pacific Islander graduates lived in the West, and about one-half of Black graduates lived in the South. Black, Hispanic, and White graduates were all concentrated more heavily in the South in 2003 than in any of the other three regions. \u2022 In 2003, most graduates lived in the state where their bachelor's degree institution was located (61 percent) and lived in the same state as their \"home\" state (for traditional students, typically the state in which they attended high school) as well (67 percent). Both types of interstate mobility increased as the educational attainment of graduates' parents increased (that is, the percentages living in the same state decreased). \u2022 In 2003, those who majored in education while working for a bachelor's degree were more likely than average to be living in the state where that institution was located (71 vs. 61 percent). Graduates who majored in education were more likely than average to live in their home state (75 vs. 67 percent), while those who majored in humanities (55 percent) were less likely than average to do so. \u2022 About 65 percent of graduates of public 4-year institutions lived in the state of their bachelor's degree institution, compared with 53 percent of graduates of private not-for-profit insti-tutions. Sixty-nine percent of graduates from public 4-year institutions and 64 percent of graduates from private not-for-profit 4-year institutions lived in their home state as well. \u2022 Graduates who had attained no degree beyond a bachelor's by 2003 were more likely than those who had attained a doctoral or first-professional degree to live in the same state as their bachelor's degree institution and the same state as their home state. About 64 percent of those with a bachelor's degree lived in the same state as their bachelor's degree institution 10 years later, compared with 38 percent of those who had earned a doctoral or first-professional degree. \u2022 Graduates who were single were less likely that others to live in the same state as their bachelor's institution 10 years after completing the degree, followed by married or cohabiting graduates and then separated, divorced, or widowed graduates. \u2022 Parents with one or more dependents under age 18 were more likely than graduates with no dependents to be living in the same state as their bachelor's degree institution or their home state.                     \u2022 Ten years after graduation, Asian bachelor's degree recipients were less likely than Black or White bachelor's degree recipients to have volunteered in the past year (37 vs. 47 and 48 percent, respectively). While they appeared to have been less likely to volunteer than Hispanic graduates (45 percent) as well, the difference was not statistically significant. \u2022 In 2003, 1992-93 college graduates who earned higher GPAs as undergraduates were more likely than their peers with lower GPAs to have participated in community service within the past year. Among volunteers, GPA was also directly related to education-related volunteer work. Fifty-two percent of students with a GPA of 3.75 or higher had volunteered in the past year, compared with 44 percent of those with a GPA below 2.75. \u2022 As of 2003, 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who took more than 6 years to complete a bachelor's degree were more likely than those who took less time to have volunteered in the past year (53 vs. 45 percent). In addition, among those who had volunteered, those who took more than 6 years also were more likely than those completing in less time to have participated in community service activities related to education or religious institutions. \u2022 Among graduates who reported doing community service, a greater proportion of those who were not enrolled in any postsecondary education in 2003 had volunteered for fundraising than those who were currently enrolled. \u2022 Compared with bachelor's degree recipients, those 1992-93 graduates who held a master's, doctoral, or first-professional degree were more likely to report having volunteered for education-related activities in the past year."}, {"section_title": "Table V.2", "text": "\u2022 Among 1992-93 graduates who had volunteered in the past year, 8 percent had done so daily, 34 percent had done so weekly, and 29 percent had done so monthly.

Smaller proportions had sent a letter (16 percent) or made a telephone call (12 percent). Women were slightly more likely than men to have written a letter (18 vs. 15 percent). \u2022 As of 2003, White graduates were more likely than Asian and Hispanic graduates to have written a letter to a public official. Furthermore, 27 percent of White students had written an e-mail to a public official, compared with 18 percent of Asian graduates and 17 percent of Black graduates. \u2022 Ten years later, older 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients were more likely than their younger peers to have contacted a public official in the past 2 years, particularly by letter or e-mail. Twenty-six percent of college graduates in the oldest age group had written a letter in the past 2 years, compared with 14-15 percent of graduates who were younger. \u2022 Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients, those who majored in humanities were more likely than those who majored in other fields (with the exception of social and behavioral sciences) to have written an e-mail to a public official. About one-third (35 percent) of humanities majors had sent an e-mail to a public official, compared with 20-26 percent of other majors. \u2022 The higher their undergraduate GPA, the more likely bachelor's degree holders were to have written a letter or e-mail to a public official in the past 2 years. For example, among graduates with a GPA of 3.75 or higher, 32 percent had written an e-mail and 24 percent had written a letter, compared with 23 and 14 percent, respectively, of graduates whose GPA was below 2.75. \u2022 Ten years after completing college, graduates who worked in multiple jobs were more likely than those who were employed full time in one job or those who were out of the labor force to have contacted a public official by letter, e-mail, or telephone within the past 2 years. \u2022 Generally, college graduates who were employed by for-profit companies were less likely than those who were self-employed, working for not-for-profit organizations, or employed by local and state governments to have contacted a public official via a phone call or a written letter. However, individuals in the for-profit sector were more likely than those employed by the military to have written an e-mail or made a phone call to a public official.

When estimates are not independent, a covariance term must be added to the formula: (2) where r is the correlation between the two estimates. 3 This formula is used when comparing two percentages from a distribution that adds to 100. If the comparison is between the mean of a subgroup and the mean of the total group, the following formula is used:  where p is the proportion of the total group contained in the subgroup. 4 The estimates, standard errors, and correlations can all be obtained from the DAS."}]
