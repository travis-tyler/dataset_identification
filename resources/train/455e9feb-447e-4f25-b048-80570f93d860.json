[{"section_title": "", "text": "In school year 2017-18, approximately 38.5 million U.S. public school students (78 percent) were enrolled in a school where a violent incident occurred (figure 1). In school years 2007-08 and 2017-18, the number of students enrolled in a school in which a physical attack or fight without a weapon occurred was higher than for any other type of incident. The number of students enrolled in a school where this type of incident occurred was lower in 2017-18 (74 percent, or about 36.3 million students), compared to 2007-08 (81 percent, or about 38.8 million students). This pattern was observed for most types of violent incidents. In contrast, the number of students enrolled in a school where a threat of physical attack with a weapon occurred in 2017-18 (16 percent, or about 7.8 million students) was higher than in 2007-08 (11 percent, or about 5.4 million students). A similar pattern was observed for the number of students enrolled in a school where a sexual assault occurred (8 percent, or about 4.0 million students in 2017-18 vs. 4 percent, or about 1.9 million students in 2007-08). In 2017-18, about 1.4 million public school students (3 percent) were enrolled in a school in which a hate crime occurred. 5 This report estimates the number and percentage of public school students who were enrolled in a school where any violent incidents 1 and hate crimes 2 occurred at school in 2007-08 and 2017-18, 3 as reported by school principals. It also investigates whether these incidents occurred in schools in which a sworn law enforcement officer 4 was present at least once a week. It is important to note that complex interactions and causal relationships have not been explored in this report; the data do not allow an interpretation of what causes the relationship between the presence of sworn law enforcement officers and the prevalence of violence in schools. Even if only a few students were directly involved in an incident, other students at the school may have been exposed to violence by witnessing To learn more about the data collection used in this report, visit https://nces.ed.gov/ surveys/ssocs/.

In school year 2017-18, more students who were enrolled in a school with a sworn law enforcement officer were in a school where a violent incident had occurred (84 percent), compared with students enrolled in a school without an officer present (70 percent, figure 2). For nearly every violent incident type examined, higher percentages of students in schools that had a sworn law enforcement officer present at school at least once a week were in schools where a violent incident had occurred, compared with students in schools without an officer present. For example, of students enrolled in schools that had a sworn law enforcement officer present at school at least once a week, 11 percent were in a school where a sexual assault had occurred in school year 2017-18, compared with 3 percent of students enrolled in schools without an officer present. The one incident that was an exception to this pattern was physical attack or fight with a weapon; for this incident type, there was no measurable difference in the percentage of students enrolled in a school where this type of violence had occurred by whether an officer was present. In school year 2017-18, about 4 percent of students enrolled in a school that had a sworn law enforcement officer present at school at least once a week were in a school where a hate crime occurred, compared with 2 percent of students in schools without an officer present. 1 \"Hate crime\" refers to a committed criminal offense that is motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender's bias(es) against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity; also known as bias crime. !

Data on the number of schools in which certain incidents occurred can be found in Crime, Violence, Discipline, andSafety in U.S. Public Schools: Findings From the School Survey on Crime andSafety: 2017-18 (NCES 2019-061). In this report, the number of students is reported rather than the number of schools to account for differences in school size. 4 \"Sworn law enforcement officers\" include School Resource Officers and other sworn law enforcement officers who are not School Resource Officers. Estimates related to sworn law enforcement officers should be considered in the context of school characteristics that may be related to the prevalence of these officers, such as school enrollment size or locale."}]
