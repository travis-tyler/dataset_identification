These include macrostructural effects such as gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) atrophy, as well as microstructural WM alterations, such as Wallerian degeneration and compromised myelin integrity. GM atrophy can be identified using volumetric measures based on anatomical MRI, whereas microstructural alterations can be identified using diffusion MRI (dMRI), a method that is sensitive to micron scale tissue architecture (2).\nMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often a pre-stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with a tenfold higher risk of developing dementia compared with healthy subjects (3) . Therefore, the detection of imaging abnormalities in MCI may increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of AD, as it may lead to improved early detection of patients at risk, and may thus provide an objective means for the assessment of medication(s) in early stage clinical trials. MRI studies have not yet been able to provide a robust diagnostic measure for the early stages of the disease (4) . Specifically, dMRI studies report inconsistent findings when comparing patients with MCI and controls, even when using similar analysis methods (e.g. see tract based spatial statistics (TBSS) studies in Table S1 ).\nThe inconsistent findings in MCI might stem from the fact that the cognitive deficits of some patients may stabilize, improve, or progress to other dementias (5) . Patients with MCI are also likely to have different underlying pathology, as for example some subjects have AD pathology in the form of neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) and beta amyloid (A\u03b2) neuritic plaques (6) , which may be responsible for the MCI, while others may not have AD pathology, and their MCI is due to other pathologies (5) . Therefore, patients with MCI do not comprise one clinical entity, which limits the predictive validity of MCI imaging abnormalities as a pre-dementia syndrome and/or as biomarkers of AD pathology (7) (8) (9) (10) .\nAnother limiting factor in the study of patients with MCI and AD is the influence of brain atrophy on the sensitivity of dMRI to microstructural changes. Part of the atrophy is likely age associated, since atrophy also appears in normal aging (11) . Moreover, many structural MRI studies have demonstrated increased GM atrophy (e.g., hippocampi, entorhinal cortex, amygdala) and WM atrophy (e.g., Corpus callosum) in patients with AD or MCI in comparison with age-matched controls (12, 13) . Atrophy in subjects with MCI might be an early manifestation of AD pathology (14) . Nevertheless, atrophy has limited specificity as a pre-curser of AD, as it may appear both in subjects with MCI who will develop AD and also appear in those who will not, as well as in patients with other brain disorders. Atrophy introduces macroscopic morphological changes in WM, such as loss of volume, reduced cellular density and increased extracellular space (15) , which due to the limited resolution of dMRI, increases the influence of partial volume between different tissues (16) . Unless these macroscopic morphological changes are accounted for, they decrease dMRI specificity and lead to difficulties in the interpretation of derived measurements. Thus, the partial volume effects associated with variable amounts of atrophy may have affected the interpretation of previous data (16) . This, in conjunction with the group heterogeneity, might explain the diversity of previous findings regarding dMRI alterations in MCI.\nOur aim is to decouple macroscopic and microscopic effects and obtain dMRI derived microstructural precursors of dementia by studying a sample of subjects diagnosed with MCI who were followed for 3 years after an initial MRI scan. Within this period, some subjects developed dementia and were diagnosed with AD, while others did not. By comparing these two subsets of MCI subjects, we were able to identify abnormalities that may constitute an early precursor of AD. These abnormalities were revealed only when controlling for partial-volume effects by applying the free-water imaging method (17) , which corrects each image voxel for contamination from freely diffusing extracellular water molecules. The method separately models the contribution of such molecules from water molecules that are in the vicinity of cellular membranes such as axonal membrane and myelin sheath (18) . By eliminating the extracellular contribution, the method accounts for partial-volume that could be introduced by atrophy, and makes it possible to identify whether or not microstructural changes, such as WM degeneration occur (16)."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study populations", "text": "This study comprised 48 subjects including 18 patients diagnosed with MCI, 15 patients diagnosed with AD, and 15 age-matched healthy control subjects (HC).

Group effects were evaluated using analysis of deviance for the generalized linear model implemented in MathWorks Matlab (R2012a, 7.14.0.739). Global cognitive deficits were assessed using the mini-mental state examination (MMSE). Cognitive performance was investigated with a standardized extensive neuropsychological test battery (CERAD). Subjects were classified as healthy if they scored within the age-and education-adjusted norm with respect to each of the CERAD subtests. The MCI diagnosis was defined by Levy's criteria of aging-associated cognitive decline (19) (see supplement S1). Mild to moderate AD was defined by the NINCDS-ADRDA-criteria. The clinical evaluation of all subjects included ascertainment of personal and family history, as well as physical, neurological, and neuropsychological examinations. Those with a history of ischemic heart disease, cancer, extensive macro-and microangiopathic changes on MRI, and severe cerebrovascular risk factors (e.g. instable hypertension or poorly controlled diabetes) were excluded. An MRI scan and a clinical evaluation took place at the time of recruitment. Clinical re-evaluation of the patients with MCI was performed three years after inclusion in the study (range 35-37 months). MRI was not acquired during re-evaluation. During these 3 years, 10 patients with MCI diagnostically converted to AD (MCI-c), while the remaining 8 patients with MCI maintained stable (MCInc).

The AXD and RD measures, in particular, have been shown to be associated with microstructural changes that are related to WM degeneration (20) .\nIn addition to the DTI model, we analyzed the data using the free-water imaging model (17) , which assumes a separate free-water compartment with a fixed diffusivity of 3\u00d710 \u22125 mm 2 /sec (the diffusion coefficient of free-water at body temperature). Mapping the fractional volume of the free-water compartments provides a free-water map (FW). A second compartment (the tissue compartment) fits the remaining signal, which originates from intra-and extracellular water molecules in the proximity of cellular membranes, i.e., from brain tissue (18) . The tissue compartment is modeled by a diffusion tensor, and therefore yields the same type of maps as the DTI method, only now these maps are corrected for contamination by a freely diffusing extracellular compartment (FA-cor, RDcor, and AXD-cor), and are thus expected to be more specific to WM degeneration than the measures derived from DTI alone (16, 18) . The free-water model was implemented in mitk (http://www.mitk.org). Recently, free-water corrected maps have shown increased specificity to microstructural changes with increased sensitivity to changes that occur in MCI (21, 22) and normal aging, compared with non-corrected measures.\nIn order to detect global patterns of WM degeneration, we aligned all subjects to a common space using a two-step registration approach directly on the tensor images using DTITK (http://www.nitrc.org/projects/dtitk). First, a template was bootstrapped (23), using the IXI aging template (24) . Then, a population-specific template space was created by means of affine and diffeomorphic registration (23) .

The group comparisons were done separately for each diffusivity measure (either free-water corrected or not). We tested whether the GM or WM volume is correlated with FW using a Pearson Correlation test between the respective volumes and the mean FW over the entire WM skeleton of each subject.

Further analysis revealed that the AD group had significantly increased mean FW comparing with the HC group (t(26)=\u22123.03; p<10 \u22122 ; Fig. 1b) . Similarly, total GM volume was significantly decreased between the AD group and the HC group (t(26)=3.42; p<10 \u22122 ; Fig. 1c) .

Controlling for partial-volume by using free-water elimination had little or no impact on these results, as the significant group differences were apparent in both the non-corrected (RD, Fig. 2a ) and the free-water corrected (RD-cor, Fig. 2b ) measures (p<0.05). This was despite the fact that the AD group had significantly higher FW values than the HC group (see above, and Fig. 2 ). The two corrected and non-corrected RD measures overlapped, with a small fraction of voxels on the WM skeleton that was identified by only one of the measures. The areas where RD and RD-cor overlap included the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, bilaterally, in an equal measure, similar to the extent of increased FW reported above. These areas included the medial temporal, retrosplenial regions, anterior commissure, corona radiata, internal capsule, corticopontine tracts, cerebral peduncle, striatum, and precentral gyrus. In a recent study microstructural differences independent of volumetric changes were found in these areas in AD (28) .

In other words, controlling for atrophy using the free-water elimination method drastically increased the number of areas where WM degeneration in the MCI-c group was identified. The areas identified with the RD-cor measure included the areas that were identified using the non-corrected RD values. The extent of increased RDcor identified for the MCI-c group was similar to the extent of the increased RD-cor identified for the AD group (compare Fig 2b with Fig. 3b) , although the extent of findings in the MCI-c group was slightly reduced, and in particular the frontal lobe was less affected. Specifically, the orbitofrontal cortex was bilaterally affected in MCI-c, with a predominance of the left hemisphere. The cingulate gyrus was affected bilaterally in an equal measure. The rightsided dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was spared in MCI-c, whereas the left side was affected.

These abnormalities are likely indicative of WM degeneration and were found in patients with MCI, preceding the onset of dementia, as well as in subjects who are already diagnosed with AD. These early signs of neurodegenerative processes were found across the brain.\nThe most important finding in our study is that there was a widespread and significant RDcor increase in the MCI-c group comparing with the MCI-nc group. This increase was similar in extent to that evinced when comparing the AD group with healthy controls, suggesting that neurodegenerative processes are present even before the onset of dementia in those subjects with MCI who will convert to AD in the future. DTI Findings in the early stages of AD and in MCI have been reported previously (29, 30) . Of particular note are our findings in the frontal lobe. It is generally accepted that the destructive process during the clinical course of AD follows a characteristic pattern, in which the frontal lobe is involved in the isocortical stage, with frontal lobe-related neurocognitive deterioration appearing only in the late stages of AD and absent in the MCI subjects (6) . Accordingly, we find reduced frontal lobe involvement in MCI-c comparing with AD. Nevertheless, the frontal lobe areas that show increased RD-cor in the MCI-c group strongly suggest that this pathology precedes the manifestation of frontal lobe-related symptoms (e.g. inhibition) that are absent in MCI. DTI Findings in the early stages of AD and in MCI have been reported previously (29, 30) . However, studies that did not separate MCI-c from MCI-nc are limited in their reproducibility (see Table S1 ), and studies that performed this separation were either limited to the analysis of regions of interest (9, 31, 32) or used supervised learning for classification (33, 34) . Thus, none of these studies has thus far been able to demonstrate the extent of microstructural alterations in subjects with MCI that will develop dementia. One previous study used TBSS for the examination of group differences between MCI-c and MCI-nc, but that study did not find a significant group difference and did not correct for partial volume (35) . Here, by associating the FW measure with the GM volume we are able to demonstrate that atrophy related processes are likely affecting the ability to identify microstructural DTI differences in the WM of subjects with MCI and that following free-water elimination, such WM alterations are much more robustly identified. We did not find an association between GM and WM volumes, suggesting that at least in its early stages, atrophy mostly affects the extracellular volume and the density of white matter, which are not apparent in volumetric MRI measures of WM (15) , but are apparent in the free-water measure. This is important since it will potentially improve current imaging-based AD prediction methods, which directly benefit from imaging markers that are more sensitive and more specific to AD pathology.\nAtrophy is known to be prominent in AD-type dementia (1) , and in agreement with this observation, we found highly elevated GM atrophy for AD patients compared with the other groups. A previous study in an aging population demonstrated that dMRI quantities such as RD and AXD are affected by partial-volume and atrophy, with diffusivity measures increasing as atrophy is more severe (16) . In that study, using free-water elimination to control for partial-volume effects eliminated group differences that were likely attributed to increased atrophy with aging, and did not reflect microstructural changes. In the current study, we similarly find that the AD subjects evince significantly increased FW comparing with age-matched controls, correlating with increased atrophy. However, unlike the aging study, in the current study there was a significant group difference even after the free-water correction (increased RD-cor). This suggests that in AD there are additional dMRI alterations that occur on a microstructural level. These additional findings are likely related to WM degeneration, which might appear in normal aging as well, but is known to be much more pronounced and wide-spread in subjects with AD (6).\nIn the comparison of the MCI-c and MCI-nc groups the RD-cor differences were revealed only following the free-water correction. This is opposite to previous free-water elimination studies, where the elimination of partial-volume effects served mostly to reduce group difference in the DTI corrected measures (16, 18) . This difference can be explained by noting that we found a similar degree of GM atrophy between the MCI-c and MCI-nc groups, which means that variable amounts of partial-volume effects are expected in these datasets. The variable partial-volume effects dominate the signal, introducing a bias that prevents the identification of the much more subtle microstructural group differences. The free-water elimination effectively reduces this bias, making possible the identification of whether or not there are microstructural differences between the groups. As a result, the free-water eliminated DTI measures are more specific to microstructural processes that occur in brain tissue rather than in the extracellular space (18) . In the data presented, we find that there are such microstructural changes between the MCI-c and MCI-nc groups (as well as between the AD and HC groups), whereas in previous studies on other type of populations, such microstructural changes were not found, or had a limited extent. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the free-water corrected RD (RD-cor), which decouples dMRI's microstructural effects from its macrostructural effects, provides better separability than the total volume of GM between the MCI-c and MCI-nc groups. While it is likely that regional GM volumetric measures might have increased prediction power, previous studies have demonstrated that combining conventional DTI measures with GM volumetric measures increases classification accuracy of MCI from healthy controls (36) . We therefore suggest that the free-water corrected measures could be an important addition to GM atrophy measures in the prediction of the development of dementia caused by AD. This is also supported by recent studies where free-water corrected measures in preselected WM connections were associated with changes in behavioral measures related to AD (21, 22) .\nWe have demonstrated the importance of having a sample of subjects with dMRI acquisitions at baseline and a known future conversion to AD. Future longitudinal studies on larger numbers of patients with MCI, e.g., the diffusion MRI subset of the ADNI-2 dataset on which the follow-up information will eventually become available, will allow us to substantiate our findings. Another potential extension of our work would be the incorporation of the corrected diffusion measure into network analytics applied to similar patient groups. This could potentially be translated to the clinical domain by creating a pool of normative controls and detecting and comparing degeneration patterns on a single-patient basis (37) . This information may prove useful in the individual management of patients with MCI, and possibly in the development of targeted drugs."}, {"section_title": "Supplementary Material", "text": "Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.
