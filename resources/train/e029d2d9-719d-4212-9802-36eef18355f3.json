[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "White matter signal abnormalities (WMSA) are a common observation on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in older individuals as well as patients with dementia. WMSA appear dark (i.e. hypo-intense) on T1-weighted images and bright (i.e. hyper intense) on FLAIR images, showing a generally larger volume on FLAIR images compared with T1-weighted images. Their prevalence and severity increase with age and are associated with cognitive dysfunction and an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Abe et al., 2002; Burns et al., 2005; de Leeuw et al., 2001; DeCarli et al., 1995; Erten-Lyons et al., 2013) . While the underlying pathology of WMSA is still not fully understood, they are considered to be an important proxy for vascular associated brain tissue damage Salat, 2014; Wardlaw et al., 2013a; Wardlaw et al., 2013b) . Meta-analysis of 19 studies correlating post-mortem observations of WMSA with pathology data revealed that the suspected pathogenic mechanisms are heterogeneous, including ischemia/hypoxia, hypo-perfusion and altered cerebrovascular autoregulation, blood brain barrier leakage, inflammation, degeneration and amyloid angiopathy (Erten-Lyons et al., 2013; Gouw et al., 2011; Gouw et al., 2008) .\nThe wide range of potential etiologies underlying WMSA reflects the currently accepted idea that WMSA have a more global effect on white matter integrity, reaching beyond the WMSA itself. Variability in microstructural changes in the NAWM have been shown to be associated with various neuropsychological measures, (Vernooij et al., 2009) suggesting that changes in NAWM integrity based on DTI may be more closely associated with early symptomatology and related early pathology in neuronal tissue cognitive decline than WMSA load (Altamura et al., 2016) . The Rotterdam study showed that WMSA may impact the health of the normal appearing white matter (NAWM), showing a relationship between WMSA burden and microstructural white matter changes in the NAWM, as measured with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (Vernooij et al., 2008) . In this study, the relation between regional decreases in FA and age were nearly completely explained by white matter atrophy or white matter lesions. Interestingly, Leritz et al, applied a similar approach, but defined the WMSA using T1-contrast and reported that WMSA do not fully explain the association between age and microstructural white matter changes in the NAWM. The latter authors suggested that the differences in the amount of explained variance by WMSA may be dependent on the MRI contrast on which WMSA are defined (Leritz et al., 2014) .\nThis could suggest that WMSA identified on either T1 or FLAIR images reflect different neural markers or represent similar pathologies but have a different sensitivity to the severity of the pathology. Studies in multiple M A N U S C R I P T"}, {"section_title": "A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT", "text": "5 sclerosis patients (MS), showed that the T1-sequence is more specific for atrophy (Sailer et al., 2001) and that T1-WMSA are histologically correlated with axonal loss and demyelination (Bitsch et al., 2001 ). However, logtransformed WMSA volumes determined on FLAIR images are on average 1.14 times higher than those on T1-weighted images, but both volumes are highly correlated in both aging and MS (Coutu et al., 2016) (Klistorner et al., 2016) .\nWMSA are also important for the clinical outcome of patients, as large WMSA have been linked to dementia (Prins and Scheltens, 2015) . But distinguishing cognitively healthy individuals from those with incipient to mild cognitive impairment based on WMSA is more challenging. Studies correlating the WMSA burden with cognition have shown both negative and positive associations as well as no associations Burns et al., 2005; de Mendonca et al., 2005; Debette et al., 2007; Jacobs et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2000; Tullberg et al., 2004) .\nDTI may be a more promising technique to identify subgroups early on in the disease as it is more sensitive to microstructural changes. Variability in microstructural properties in the NAWM has been shown to be associated with various neuropsychological measures in the general population (Vernooij et al., 2009 ) and in patients with dementia (Altamura et al., 2016) .This suggests that NAWM integrity measures based on DTI may be more closely associated with early symptomatology and related early pathology in neuronal tissue than WMSA load. The NAWM may indeed contain valuable predictive information for pathology, as changes in the DTI properties of the penumbra of WMSA have been shown to predict future formation of WMSA (Amlien and Fjell, 2014; Maillard et al., 2013) .\nIt is the aim of this study to investigate whether the microstructural properties of white matter tissue measured with DTI within WMSA, differs between those identified on T1 weighted images, from those identified on FLAIR images in memory clinic patients which received a clinical diagnoses of AD, MCI, SCD and in normal controls.\nFurthermore, based on the previously discussed literature we expect that the white matter integrity in the NAWM and the border surrounding the WMSA will be higher, compared to the integrity in the FLAIR or T1 defined regions. Finally, to test the hypothesis that the discrimination of diagnostic groups by DTI measures may be dependent on the choice of the ROI we also investigated the probability of diffusion values in these different (ROIs) to distinguish groups based on clinical diagnoses. The results of this study can provide more insight into the difference in WM integrity of WMSA defined on T1 versus FLAIR in neurodegenerative disorders and can contribute in tailoring more sensitive biomarkers based on DTI data.\nTE=100ms, flip angle=90\u00b0, number of slices=48 (axial, no slice gap), matrix size=512x512, and voxel size=0.5x0.5x3.0mm. The FLAIR images were acquired with TR=11000ms, TE=125ms, TI=2800ms, flip angle=90\u00b0, number of slices=48 (axial, no slice gap), matrix size=512x512, and voxel size=0.5x0.5x3.0mm. The field of view across the various sequences was kept constant to improve registration and anatomical localization. The diffusion weighted images were acquired with TR=8250ms, TE=80ms, number of slices=70 (axial), 61 directions with b value=1000 (s/mm 2 ), one b=0 scan, matrix size=128x128, and voxel size=2.0x2.0x2.0mm.\n11 els are non-nested, likelihood ratio testing was not possible, hence we used the weighted delta AICc, which accounts for finite sample size, to compare the performance of the various models in combination with the evidence ratio (Burnham et al., 2011) .\nPredicting clinical diagnosis group based on diffusion values from the different ROIs.\n14 define WMSA (Bitsch et al., 2001; Leritz et al., 2014; Sailer et al., 2001 ). Our results add important information to the existing literature by showing that first, the diffusion properties underlying T1 defined WMSA are more abnormal than those defined on the FLAIR images, additionally T1notFL voxels are different from general T1 voxels, while FLnotT1 are not different from general FLAIR, suggesting that these two MRI contrasts provide different information regarding the underlying pathology. Second, even though most ROIs showed differences in all DTI metrics across the entire group, an interaction effect with diagnosis was only observed in the FA values. This may suggest that the FA metric may be more sensitive to subtle differences in white matter health compared to the MD.\nThird, diffusion values from the NAWM can predict group adherence of individuals of varying cognitive impairment with higher probabilities than the other white matter ROIs. Even though T1-weighted WMSA were characterized by the most abnormal diffusion values, they also provide the lowest classification accuracy. These results illustrate a need for a better understanding of what the underlying pathology for WMSA may constitute and how it can be detected and defined in various MRI sequences.\nWMSA can be defined on both T1 and FLAIR weighted images, although aging and Alzheimer's research has mainly focused on FLAIR weighted WMSA. The considerable heterogeneity in pathology within WMSA and between WMSA and the penumbra of the WMSA areas, suggests that not all WMSA reflect the same degree or type of white matter damage (Gouw et al., 2011; Gouw et al., 2008; Maillard et al., 2011; Maillard et al., 2014; Viswanathan, 2014) . Our study shows that T1 and FLAIR signal abnormalities are highly co-localized phenomena as most, but not all, T1 defined WMSA are localized within the FLAIR defined WMSA. While volumes of T1-defined WMSA correlated highly with the FLAIR defined WMSA, T1 WMSA was characterized by more aberrant diffusion values compared to the FLAIR defined WMSA. We did not observe a different pattern with regards to the various diffusion metrics across the ROIs for all groups, but rather observed differences in the magnitude of the diffusion values, which may indicate that T1 defined WMSA, reflect more severe rather than different pathology compared to FLAIR-defined WMSA.\nPost-mortem neuropathology combined with high-field MRI determined that myelin is a dominant source of MRI contrast in T1 maps (Stuber et al., 2014) . Additionally in MS, T1 lesions are thought to be a combination of permanent demyelination and loss of tissue matrix (Klistorner et al., 2016) . The reported high correlation of T1 and T2-weighted WMSA volumes in the latter study (r =0.94) is very similar to those computed from a subsample of the ADNI population (r=0.96) (Coutu et al., 2016) and our findings (r=0.89) and suggest that even though the volumes M A N U S C R I P T\nare similar, the tissue integrity is more severely affected in T1-defined WMSA compared to the FLAIR ones. It is important to note that the pathology and symptomatology underlying MS is different than that in AD, though neuroinflammatory responses can be a component of this signal, as neuro-inflammation also plays an important role in disease progression of AD (Calsolaro and Edison, 2016) .\nAs for FLAIR, a recent series of 134 pre-mortem MRI scans and subsequent autopsy observed that FLAIR sequence-identified WMSA overestimated demyelination in the periventricular and perivascular regions but underestimated it in the deep WM during normal brain aging (Haller et al., 2013) . This is possibly due to increased bloodbrain barrier permeability in the perivascular and periventricular areas leading to a higher high local water concentration. Maillard and colleagues (2014) reported normalizing FLAIR signal over time in stagnant WMSA, possibly due to a resolving inflammation. FLAIR WMSA could therefore be a mix of white matter damage, periinflammatory processes as well as proxies of increased vascular and blood-brain barrier permeability (Young et al., 2008) whereas T1 WMSA would involve areas with more severe demyelinating damage. It may therefore be speculated that T1 WMSA, especially outside the FLAIR boundaries, reflect more consolidated WMSA.\nWe found that the NAWM is negatively affected in patients; this is consistent with literature (Maillard et al., 2014; Maniega et al., 2015; Topakian et al., 2010) . A new intriguing finding is that the difference in FA values between the NAWM and the other ROIs seems to be related to the diagnosis, while there was no such clear association for MD. We did not find overall or group differences between the NAWM and the border zone. While the border zone has the highest probability of capturing voxels of the penumbra as they are closest to the WMSA, the average signal could be influenced by including voxels of the NAWM. The interpretation of the underlying biology is speculative, and care should be taken not to interpret the findings beyond what can reasonably be deducted from the tensor model. Any small non-proportional change in any of the eigenvectors could hypothetically result in a large change in FA especially when the magnitude of the vectors is small. Very early stages of deteriorating cellular health and its resulting minute microstructural changes could possibly introduce a reduction in anisotropy that would be more apparent in the FA but much less so in MD, RD or AxD. This may explain why the FA values in overlap and T1-defined WMSA are in the same range for all diagnostic groups, including the healthy controls, while showing a clear difference in de distribution of the MD values between healthy controls and patients. Possible underlying biological processes can be neurofibrillary loss, glial damage, increased fluid in the extracellular and perivascular space, but more work is needed to better understand the relation between biology and diffusion."}, {"section_title": "M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT", "text": "\n\n\n\nEven though the diffusion values for T1-defined WMSA were the most aberrant, the diffusion properties of the NAWM show promise as a predictor for diagnostic adherence. The fact that the mean FA in NAWM was a better predictor of group adherence than the mean FA in the Border zone, suggests that more variance can be found in the NAWM that is not adjacent to any WMSA. These results are not conclusive as the groups are small and there are confounders that the current data available do not allow us to adequately control for. Despite these limitations, the results of the multinomial logistic regression are consistent with previous studies showing that subtle white matter alterations can occur in the NAWM in clinically healthy older individuals (Firbank et al., 2003; Maillard et al., 2014; Maniega et al., 2015; Vernooij et al., 2009 ). Our results now show similar findings in a memory-clinic population. Replication in larger populations will be needed to reach more definitive conclusions.\nNotably, we included SCD individuals in our sample to have a broad range of individuals and spanning the entire range from healthy aging to AD dementia. Interestingly, the diffusion values of the SCD group in our sample behaved quite similarly as the AD group. Studies including individuals with SCD reported higher volumes of temporal WMSA, lower hippocampal volume and more A\u03b2 compared to controls. (Amariglio et al., 2015; Schultz et al., 2015; Stewart et al., 2008; van der Flier et al., 2004) . Inconsistent findings have been reported regarding alterations in the microstructural properties of white matter in SCD individuals. So far, the few studies performed within SCD, observed either local lower FA and higher MD values in medial temporal lobe regions in SCD individuals compared to controls (Ryu et al., 2017) (Wang et al., 2012) , or no differences between both groups (Kiuchi et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2012) . One study reported that DTI was a better predictor for the progression of SCD to AD than CSF markers (Selnes et al., 2013) . These inconsistencies may be related to the criteria used to define SCD (Jessen et al., 2014) or the recruitment strategy (Perrotin et al., 2017) . We adopted a broad definition of SCD, allowing everybody entering the outpatient memory clinic presenting with complaints but no objective memory deficits (Cognitive tests within 1.5 SD of mean corrected for age, education and sex) and no clear medical reason underlying these deficits into the study. Therefore, this group of subjective memory complaints represents a heterogeneous group in terms of the underlying etiology of their complaints. We did not have information on amyloid burden or genetic risk factors in these individuals, but 53 % of the MTA scores of the SCD group were 2 or higher, indicative for ongoing neurodegenerative processes, potentially AD-related. Furthermore, correcting for the level of depressive symptoms, which was higher in SCD individuals, did not change our results, suggesting that mood was most likely not driving these relationships.\nThere are some limitations to this study. As this study population was acquired in a clinical setting, the spatial resolution of the FLAIR sequence was based on commonly used clinical parameters. By warping all images to FLAIR resolution, we may have lost some information. Replication of these results using high-resolution isotropic FLAIR sequence could provide more detailed information. Furthermore, the used DTI sequence does not take into account the effects of crossing and kissing fibers, more complex models using multi shell acquisition schemes could be considered for future studies. The results were derived using two separate software packages (GIANT and FreeSurfer) to extract FLAIR and T1 WMSA. Although GIANT is designed to closely interact with FreeSurfer this could possibly induce a bias. As we did not collect amyloid or tau data on these individuals, we cannot totally rule out that some of our cognitively normal participants are in a preclinical AD stage, and cannot fully guarantee that the cognitive impairment in the MCI and AD groups was due to Alzheimer pathology. We also did not incorporate other measures of vascular health, such as blood pressure, cholesterol or diabetes, as these were not available for all participants. Cardiovascular risk factors have been shown to be linked independently to WMSA and DTI metrics (Jacobs et al., 2013) , and therefore may relate differently to T1 or FLAIR defined WMSA. Even though, our results survived stringent multiple comparisons corrections, the sample size is moderate and replication in larger cohorts is needed.\n"}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "A total of 85 patients (subjective cognitive decline (SCD, n=26) patients, mild cognitively impaired patients (MCI, n=43) and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD, n=16)) were recruited at the memory clinic of Maastricht University Medical Center. Additionally, 18 healthy participants without signs or complaints of cognitive impairment were recruited via advertisements from the general population to serve as cognitively normal controls (CN). All patients underwent a standard diagnostic workup, including clinical history taking, medical and neurological examination, blood draw for clinical chemistry, functional evaluation using the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) (Hughes et al., 1982) , rating scales for depression and neuropsychiatric symptoms, a neuropsychological test battery and neuroimaging. The diagnoses were made by a senior staff member (FRJV) using the core clinical criteria for MCI and AD (Albert et al., 2011; McKhann et al., 2011) . Criteria for SCD diagnosis included the self-reported presence of subjective cognitive complaints, but absence of impairment in any of the measured cognitive domains (normal scores on age-, gender-, and education-adjusted performance (within 1.5SD of the mean) on the standardized cognitive tests). Controls were required to have a CDR of 0, no cognitive complaints and no evidence of cognitive deficits on testing.

The axial FLAIR and T2-weighted images were displayed side by side allowing for visual inspection and easy identification of WMSA while they were traced manually.\nThese manual WMSA traces served as input to train the segmentation algorithm. The actual segmentation was then performed semi-automatically by identifying each WMSA region in each slice of the simultaneously displayed FLAIR and T2-weighted images to provide a seed point to initiate a region-growing algorithm. Manual corrections were performed slice-by-slice where necessary by a single trained rater (WMF), who performed excellent (intra class correlation (ICC) >0.98, (Shrout and Fleiss, 1979) ) when compared to an experienced neuro-radiologist on two independent datasets.

In brief, the diffusion-weighted data were corrected for motion and eddy current induced distortions, incorporating the B-matrix rotation to preserve the diffusion gradient orientation information correctly (Leemans and Jones, 2009 ). This was done in one step together with the correction for echo-planar imaging (EPI) and susceptibility distortions, using the T1 data as the undistorted template to unwarp the diffusion data using rigid transformations (Irfanoglu et al., 2012) . The diffusion tensor was estimated from the aforementioned data (in isotropic T1 space) using \"RESTORE\", a robust non-linear least-squares method (Chang et al., 2005) . From this diffusion tensor, the DTI metrics Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Mean Diffusivity (MD), Radial Diffusivity (RD) and Axial Diffusivity (AxD) were derived. Diffusion images were thresholded at individual level of FA > 0.20 to minimize a bias due to partial volume effects of voxels located on the border of white matter and CSF, or the border of white and gray matter (Jones et al., 2013) To extract DTI metrics from the WMSA data, the T1 data were co-registered linearly to each individual's FLAIR-weighted scan data by using FLIRT from FSL version 5.0.4. Using the derived warp field, the DTI data were subsequently warped to the FLAIR data. All warping was done using affine transformations. The same procedure was applied to the FreeSurfer data to warp the T1-weighted hypo-intensities to the FLAIR data. All registrations were checked visually to ensure correctness. DTI metrics were then extracted from the WMSA determined on the FLAIR images, T1-weighted images, and the overlapping voxels of the FLAIR-and T1-based WMSA, FLAIRnot-T1 and T1-not-FLAIR (see Figure 1 ). Additionally, a border zone surrounding the union of T1 and FLAIR WMSA (T1\u222a FLAIR) was determined by dilating this region of WMSA by one voxel. Voxels located in the ventricles were excluded from this border zone. The remaining white matter (i.e., white matter tissue map of FreeSurfer excluding the union of T1 and FLAIR WMSA and its dilated border) was labelled as normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and DTI metrics were also extracted from this region. This resulted in diffusion metrics extracted from 7 regions: the FLAIR-defined WMSA, FLAIR not T1 (FLnotT1), T1 not FLAIR (T1not FL), T1-defined WMSA, the overlap between T1 and FLAIR defined WMSA, the border of WMSA and the NAWM.

Fisher Exact tests were used to test for differences in proportions between groups for categorical variables. All pairwise t-tests were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni method.\nTo investigate whether the diffusivity values differed depending on the different regions of interest (ROIs), we conducted linear mixed effects analyses with a random intercept for each participant using the restricted estimated maximum likelihood method for parameter estimation within the LME4 package (Bates, Maechler & Bolker, 2012) .\nThis approach allowed us to control for interdependency from the multiple measurements (ROIs) per participant.

A lower AIC indicates a better model whereas the \u2206AICc compares the relative merit of each model (supplemental table 3 ).\nThe \u2206AICc of NAWM and Border zone 10.60, between the Border zone and the FLAIR 15.45, between the FLAIR and the T1 11.41 and between the T1 and Overlap 8.97, and T1 not FL vs T1 8.9 indicating a higher likelihood of information loss when comparing to the next best model, whereas between FLnotT1 and FLAIR the \u2206AICc of 1.6\nindicates that the models are relatively equal in merit. The evidence ratio of weighted AIC's indicated 4.6 *10 5 times stronger evidence for the NAWM model relative to the FLAIR model and 201.1 times stronger relative to the Border zone."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this study we aimed to investigate differences in microstructural properties of T1 and FLAIR defined WMSA in a total of 103 participants within the range of cognitively healthy to AD dementia.

T1 and FLAIR-defined WMSA are microstructurally different, potentially reflecting differences in the type or severity of white matter pathology in individuals with cognitive decline and in healthy older adults. Diffusion values of the NAWM have potential for use as an early and sensitive indicator for brain health decline in AD. Further investigation is warranted, especially in SCD individuals and in larger longitudinal samples."}, {"section_title": "Funding", "text": "This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nWF is supported by Alzheimer Nederland (research grant WE-03-2012-40) .
