It has been reported that brain iron may combine with amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) to propel cognitive decline (Ayton et al., 2017b . Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ferritin levels were found to be associated with longitudinal changes in cognition, brain glucose metabolism, and CSF A\u03b242 (Ayton et al., 2015 Diouf et al., 2019) . A clinical trial of 48 patients with AD suggests that deferoxamine, an iron chelator, may slow the clinical progression (Crapper McLachlan et al., 1991) . While evidence in both preclinical and clinical studies support the notion that brain iron elevation could contribute to cognitive decline and the incidence of dementia (Lane et al., 2018; Nikseresht et al., 2019) , prospective evidence about the association between plasma transferrin (which transports iron) and changes in cognitive performance over time is lacking.\nTransferrin is a crucial circulating protein that is involved in the mobilization and transformation of iron (Kawabata, 2019) . It has been reported that the transferrin C2 allele is associated with a higher risk of developing AD dementia (Namekata et al., 1997; Zambenedetti et al., 2003) . Previous cross-sectional studies did not observe a significant difference in blood transferrin levels between healthy controls and AD patients (Fischer et al., 1997; Squitti et al., 2010; Torsdottir et al., 2011) . Blood transferrin levels were reported to be positively associated with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores in AD patients (Fischer et al., 1997) , but this association was not replicated in another study (Squitti et al., 2010) . Moreover, no study has attempted to examine the association between baseline plasma transferrin levels and changes in cognitive performance over time.\nIn this study, we compared the levels of transferrin in plasma among individuals with normal cognition (NC), individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and patients with mild AD dementia from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort.

Several linear mixed models were used to compare the slopes of cognitive decline between the three tertiles among the MCI subjects (please see Supplementary Data Sheet 1)."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "There were several findings in the present study. First, no significant differences in the plasma transferrin levels were observed across the three diagnostic groups. Second, in the cross-sectional study, the baseline plasma transferrin levels were negatively associated with the MMSE scores in the NC group, but not in the MCI or the AD group. Finally, in the longitudinal study, we found that a higher plasma transferrin was associated with a steeper cognitive decline in the MCI and AD groups, but not in the NC group.\nIn the cross-sectional study, we found that plasma transferrin was negatively associated with the MMSE scores in older individuals with NC, but not in MCI or AD patients. The negative association between plasma transferrin and the MMSE scores observed in individuals with NC may indicate that higher levels of plasma transferrin could have adverse effects on cognitive performance among cognitively normal older people. However, Fischer et al. (1997) found that serum levels of transferrin were positively associated with the MMSE scores in 41 AD patients (Fischer et al., 1997) , which is not in line with our finding in AD patients. This inconsistency may be due to several potential contributors, such as: (1) the different sample, which could be serum or plasma; (2) the sample size; (3) different severities of dementia; and (4) the different methodological techniques used to determine the levels of transferrin.\nIn the longitudinal study, the finding that higher plasma transferrin levels at baseline were associated with a steeper cognitive decline in older individuals with MCI and AD is novel. Regarding the biology of transferrin, it plays a crucial role in the mobilization and transformation of iron (Kawabata, 2019) . Human transferrin is a 76-kDa protein that is primarily expressed in the liver and has a half-life of 8 days (Kemp et al., 1984) . A large portion of brain iron originates from the transferrin iron in the blood (Moos et al., 2006 (Moos et al., , 2007 Skj\u00f8rringe et al., 2015) . It has been suggested that brain iron accumulation is a key feature of AD (van Rooden et al., 2015) and might play an important role in the oxidative damage found in AD brains (Smith et al., 1997) . Ferritin is another iron-binding protein, and higher CSF ferritin levels were reported to be associated with a greater cognitive decline over a period of 7 years among cognitively normal older individuals carrying the APOE4 allele (Ayton et al., 2017a) . Further, a clinical trial of 48 AD patients suggested that deferoxamine, an iron chelator, may slow the clinical progression (Crapper McLachlan et al., 1991) . Collectively, these data strengthen the notion that the dysregulation of iron metabolism might contribute to the pathogenesis of AD, and lowering the levels of plasma transferrin should be considered as a therapeutic strategy to slow the cognitive decline in MCI and AD patients. However, this notion should be tested in further clinical trials.\nThere are several limitations in the present study. First, in the longitudinal study, we did not observe an association between plasma transferrin and cognitive decline in the NC group. This may be due to the fact that the number of participants in the NC group was relatively smaller than that in the MCI group. Thus, the association between the plasma transferrin levels and cognitive decline in the NC group will need further investigation. Second, participants recruited in the present study represent a convenience sample, and this may limit the generalization of our findings. Third, the causal association between plasma transferrin and cognitive decline cannot be determined due to the study design. Further clinical trials will be warranted. Finally, we cannot rule out the possibility that other analytes may have some potential effects on the levels of plasma transferrin due to the fact that transferrin was measured by a multiplex assay rather than a more targeted assay. Therefore, our results should be further validated in a future study with a more targeted assay.\nIn conclusion, higher plasma transferrin levels were associated with a steeper cognitive decline in patients with MCI and AD."}, {"section_title": "DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT", "text": "The datasets generated for this study will not be made publicly available.
