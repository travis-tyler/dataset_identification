[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The World Health Organization declared COVID-19, has been declared a global pandemic by the WHO on March 11th 2020 (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). Its potentially life-threatening consequences also entail serious social and economic repercussions. Three major actions, confinement, detection, and therapy are required to contain this pandemic. Detection and therapy can be guided by virus sequence data, which was first made available in January 2020 at gsaid.org, soon after detection of the first cases. The SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence data are a pivotal resource on its own, but can gain greater value when embedded within those of other Betacoronavirus, allowing a comparative pangenomic analysis. This approach can help identify the core genome of Betacoronaviruses and extract accessory genomic features shared by a subset of these viruses or unique to SARS-CoV-2. Whereas, core genomic features are required for the virus to be functional, accessory features are candidates to provide insights into the drivers of the unique capacities of SARS-CoV-2 explaining its spread and virulence. Genome annotation and structural modeling can then be used to assess the possible functions of these accessory features and guide approaches to detection and treatment.\nHere we apply a comparative pangenomic approach of all Betacoronavirus genomes sequenced thus far (Table 1) , to detect the core and accessory gene cluster of this genus, and then annotate the functions, further assessed through structural analysis. Furthermore, we suggest that the preservation of key features of the envelope protein, E, between SARS and SARS-CoV-2, plays a central role in the development of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Analysis of mutations from over 2,000 isolates of SARS-CoV-2 show E protein has no mutations in the key regions. Consequently, we suggest inhibition of E protein can be a good target to alleviate ARDS complication of COVID-19."}, {"section_title": "Collection of Betacoronavirus Strains", "text": "The NCBI genome assemblies page was searched, on January 26, for taxonid of genus Betacoronavirus, resulting in a list of 22 genomes, including four isolates of SARS-CoV-2.

These GenBank annotations contain heterogeneous identifiers for genes so we included unique locus tags containing the strain accession number and gene index number for computational processing. In addition, we collected metadata for these coronaviruses for displaying on the interactive phylogenetic trees for analysis later on. Gene sequences were compared to each other for sequence similarity, followed by gene clustering. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out on the core gene clusters to produce a species tree and similarly for each gene cluster to produce gene trees. For this pangenome analysis we used panX (Ding et al., 2018 ) that takes GenBank files as input and extracts gene coordinates, annotations from GenBank and sequences from these genomes on both nucleotide and protein levels. For interactive visualization of pangenome clusters, alignments and phylogenetic trees we used panX visualization module obtain from github, https://github.com/ neherlab/pan-genome-visualization/.

Our approach differs in that we first cluster all sequences to then calculate the alignment. This approach, based on using panX (Ding et al., 2018) , allows us to achieve a higher sensibility in the detection of gene clusters.

These five genes define the core pan-genome. However, panX (Ding et al., 2018) only retrieved four of these (S, M, N, and the ORF1ab) as components of the core pan-genome (Figure 1) . However, the fifth gene in the Betacoronavirus core genome, the envelope protein (E), varied among genomes, defining three distinct subclusters within the envelope protein E of Betacoronaviruses (Figure 2) . One of these E clusters comprises only SARS (AY274119), SARS-CoV-2, and two Bat Coronaviruses (MG772933 and KF63652). Among the other two protein E gene clusters, one includes MERS (JX869059 and KC164505) and several coronaviruses from different animals, while the third cluster includes coronaviruses from two Rousettus bats. To validate the conservation and specificity of the SARS E cluster, we compared the SARS-CoV-2 E sequence with all known sequences in NCBI's non-redundant (NR) protein database. This comparison showed, consistent with our pan-genome analysis, that the subcluster of the protein E gene appearing in SARS-CoV-2, SARS and two bat coronaviruses, is defined by the same essential functional features, which are exactly conserved (100% identity) between bats and SARS-CoV-2, but differ slightly (95% identity with one deletion and three substitutions) from SARS ( Figure 2B and Supplementary Information). A recent study (Wu et al., 2020) compared genomes and gene families of all alpha, beta, delta and gamma coronaviruses, but did not explore the variability present within the protein E gene sequences, which we did through the pangenome clustering approach reported above."}, {"section_title": "Accessory Genes", "text": "We found five accessory gene clusters (15% of the accessory genome of genus Betacoronavirus) common to SARS-like coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, out of 33 total accessory gene clusters. Four of these gene clusters (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, and ORF8, Figure 1A) , appear only in SARS-CoV-2, bat-SL-CoVZC45, and the SARS virus. A gene cluster annotated as ORF10 appeared to be unique to SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1) . However, a blast-based search against the DNA of all sequences in NCBI's NT database showed that the ORF10 sequence matches with 100% coverage in DNA of other SARS-like genomes, but there is no open-reading frame predicted for those genomes in the matching region ( Figure 1A) . Hence, the apparent uniqueness of ORF10 might simply be an artifact of the GenBank annotation pipeline that did not predict an ORF for this gene in other matching genomes. However, for completeness, we report a functional analysis of ORF10 as Supplementary Information since at present there is no experimental evidence available against or in favor of this being a real gene."}, {"section_title": "Annotation of Uncharacterized Genes", "text": "Compared to the essential genes S, M, N, E, and ORF1ab, other genes such as ORF3a and ORF7a are poorly characterized, according to GenBank annotations (https://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/genome/proteins/86693?genome_assembly_ id=760344). Our bioinformatic protein structural analysis confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a (cluster 12), also known Right panel: view from the cytoplasm. One chain (blue) highlights protein features. N, C: location of N and C terminus, respectively. Yellow: IC; orange: DLLV (side chains are shown as stick models). Location of the residues changed in SARS-CoV-2 E are labeled and shown in cyan. The protein structure was modeled based on the NMR model PDB id 5 \u00d7 29, and completed using our in-house modeling program (to be published). The position of the region C-terminal to K53 was adjusted compared to the NMR model (see Supplementary Figure S6 ) to avoid its positioning entirely within the membrane, which appears unlikely given its amino acid composition (in particular R61, K63, and N64).\nas viroporin, and ORF7a (cluster 17), that is same as ORF8a (Castano-Rodriguez et al., 2018) in SARS, retain the structural features observed in other SARS viruses, namely a multi-pass transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic \u03b2-barrel or \u03b2sandwich fold (ORF3a) and an N-terminal sec-pathway signal peptide, cleaved after residue 15, an immunoglobulin-like \u03b2-sandwich fold stabilized by two cysteine di-sulfide bonds, and a C-terminal single-pass transmembrane helix (ORF7a; Supplementary Figures S5, S6 ). Hence these SARS-CoV-2 proteins are expected to act in the same way as they do in other SARS, namely as accessory proteins mostly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment, but also occurring on the cell membrane where they enhance viral pathogenicity and mortality through protein-protein interactions (Hanel et al., 2006; Minakshi et al., 2009; DeDiego et al., 2014) . The remaining two accessory gene clusters, ORF6, ORF8, present in SARS-CoV-2, SARS, and bat-SL-CoVZC45 are functionally uncharacterized. All are very short polypeptides (61, 121 and 38 residues for ORF6 and 8, respectively) with a large percentage of hydrophobic residues (62 and 56%, respectively). None of the proteins have trans-membrane regions, but ORF8 has an N-terminal sec-pathway signal peptide with a cleavage site after residues 15, suggesting that it is secreted into the extracellular space (Supplementary Figures S5, S6) . Following signal peptide cleavage, the ORF8 protein core is predicted to consist largely of \u03b2-strands and features 7 cysteines. We predict that this protein adopts a cysteine disulfide-bond stabilized \u03b2-sandwich structure similar to the soluble domain of ORF7a (Supplementary Figures S5, S6) , inferring that ORF8 also functions as ligand binding module. ORF6 consists of a long amphipathic helical region, followed by an acidic tail. Our deep-learning-based annotation [DeepGOPlus Kulmanov and Hoehndorf, 2020] suggested that ORFs 6, 7, 8 are involved in the regulation of molecular functions, either in response to stimuli (ORFs 8), or in cellular component biogenesis and organization (ORF6) (Supplementary Figures S2-S4) . Collectively, our analysis suggested no major function or gene cluster to be unique to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, our analysis is in agreement with ORFs 3a, 6, 7a, 8, and being accessory non-essential proteins, that would be inefficient targets for COVID-2019 therapy."}, {"section_title": "Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 Isolates", "text": "A number of isolates from COVID-19 patients are now being made available from several countries, thanks to resources such as gisaid.org. For mutation analysis, from over 10,000 SARS-CoV-isolates available at gisaid.org, we processed around 2,000 isolates with no ambiguous bases. The frequency of mutations detected, so far, is shown in Figure 3 . There are thirteen prevalent mutations confirmed in a minimum of 100 isolates. Among these, there is one synonymous and two non-synonymous mutations appearing in over 1,000 isolates, one in Spike protein and two in gene orf1ab. A full list of \u223c529 mutations detected with a frequency confirmed by minimum two isolates is presented in Supplementary Table 1 . There are a few low frequency <5 isolates mutations detected in Spike protein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) but these do not interact with human ACE2 (Ortega et al., 2020) . Moreover, no mutations are detected in Ion Channel forming region of E protein. Alignments from isolates analyzed are available at https://trackncov.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The S protein binds to the host receptor ACE2, and hence presents a prime target for preventing viral entry into host cells (Li, 2016) . The S proteins from SARS and SARS-CoV-2 are similar (Wan et al., 2020) , but structural differences in the receptor binding domain (RBD) preclude the use of SARS-specific neutralizing antibodies to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 (Wrapp et al., 2020) . We therefore focused our attention on the protein E, which is highly similar in SARS-CoVs. The E protein, also a viroporin (Liao et al., 2006) , was previously confirmed as a determinant of pathogenicity Nieto-Torres et al., 2014) in SARS. Protein E was used as target for SARS antivirals , and studies using SARS-CoV with lacking or mutated protein E as vaccine candidates showed promising results (DeDiego et al., 2007; Lamirande et al., 2008; Regla-Nava et al., 2015; Schoeman and Fielding, 2019) . Furthermore, the E gene is one of the key genes used in identification of SARS group, however combination of probes from additional genes such as RdRP and N can unambiguously help identify SARS-CoV-2 (Corman et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020) .\nThe SARS protein E has ion channel (IC) activity and features a post-synaptic density-95/discs large/zona occludens-1 (PDZ)binding motif (PBM). Both IC and PBM were required for SARS-CoV to induce virulence in mice (Castano-Rodriguez et al., 2018) . The protein E from SARS-CoV-2 differs from that of SARS only by three substitutions and one deletion (Figures 2A,B) . The PBM and IC are identical in all SARS E proteins in SARS FIGURE 3 | Prevalent mutations detected from comparing over 2,000 high quality SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Mutations are labeled here as gene name followed by potential amino-acid mutation and nucleotide mutation, joined by colon character, \":\". Majority of prevalent mutations were detected in gene orf1ab. Among non-synonymous mutations two mutations, one in orf1ab and one in Spike protein, S, appear in over 1,000 isolates. A full list of mutations detected are shown in Supplementary Table 1. subcluster, but distinct in orthologs from the other two E subclusters (Figures 2B-D) . The substitutions and insertions are positioned in flexible cytoplasmic regions, where they are not expected to affect the protein structure, IC or function of the PBM (Figure 2E) .\nStudies on SARS demonstrate that the E protein uses the IC and PBM to trigger a cytokine storm that activates the inflammasome, leading to increased edema in lungs. Ultimately these events result in ARDS Nieto-Torres et al., 2014; Torres et al., 2015) , one of the leading causes of death in SARS and SARS-CoV-2 infection Xu et al., 2020) . The high level of conservation of the IC and PBM within clade 2, specifically SARS and SARS-CoV-2, strongly suggests that E protein of SARS-CoV-2 may be a target for therapy that can possibly be inhibited with drugs already tested on SARS. For example, the drugs AMT (1 amino-adamantane) or more effectively HMA (5-N,N-Hexamethylene amiloride) have been shown to block the IC activity of SARS-CoV-1 (Wilson et al., 2006; Behmard et al., 2018) and restrict its reproduction, leading to better survival of the animal host. Another compound BIT225 also appear to be a potent inhibitor of IC activity in p7 viroporins (Behmard et al., 2018) , see reference (Jalily et al., 2020) for more options. From the natural compounds, Glycyrrhizin, the root extract of Glycyrrhiza glabra (liquorice) has been shown previously that its high dose can completely block the replication of SARS virus (Cinatl et al., 2003) . Recent docking experiments show Glycyrrhizin (doi: 10.26434/chemrxiv.12286421.v1) as well as some other phytochemicals (Gupta et al., 2020) have the potential to block E protein IC. A more recent study (Xia et al., 2020) reported in vitro and in vivo results for existing and a few new E protein inhibitors showing potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity.\nAs numerous compounds were shown previously to interact with SARS-CoV E protein (Pervushin et al., 2009) . Given the conservation of the key features of E proteins from SARS anSARS-CoV-2, these compounds would be promising candidates for inhibiting ARDS in COVID-19. Some of the compounds were found to interact directly with the residues placed inside the channel (Pervushin et al., 2009; Surya et al., 2018) , analogous to a well-established mechanism for the tetrameric M2 channel. It seems the mechanisms of action vary among the various viroporins, like the amantadine bound to hexameric p7 channel occupying the hydrophobic clefts in a 6:1 amantadine:hexamer ratio (OuYang et al., 2013; Oestringer et al., 2018) . Nevertheless, an amantadine structure in a complex with viroporin channel was determined to interact with tetrameric M2 and a de novo designed trimeric protein in a 1:1 drug:oligomer stoichiometric ratio (Stouffer et al., 2008; Park et al., 2019) . The hexameric p7 protein channel formed a 1:6 ratio channel to drug complex, although, there was a substantial impact on p7 oligomeric state of protein to detergent ratio affecting the amantadine affinities to p7 polypeptide was detected (Oestringer et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2019) . In addition, channels are believed to exist in at least two states, open and closed, as evidenced by conductivity experiments (Nieva et al., 2012) . One common mechanism of drugs blocking the ion conductance is closing the passage through the formed oligomeric tunnel, likely through 1:1 drug:channel ratio, although other ratios were observed too, as with SARS-CoV E-protein and HMA (Pervushin et al., 2009 ). Thus, one can assume that drugs eliminate the channel functionality by forming a stable, more inert complex with functional viroporin channels, or at least, drugs inhibit intermediate step as functional channels form. We learned that M2 mutations leading to resistance against amantadine and its analogs are caused by substitutions of amino acids in the TM segment (Jalily et al., 2020) . This changes the hydrophobic volume and the geometry of the channels while still preserving their main function, ion conductivity. In the case of E protein in SARS-CoV-2, an analysis of mutations detected so far from over 2,000 isolates show that at present there are no prevalent or low frequency mutations detected in the TM or Ion channel forming residues (Figure 3 and Supplementary Table 1) .\nAdditionally, the PBM enables the E protein to interact with the cellular PDZ domains to evade host immune system (Gutierrez-Gonzalez and Santos-Mendoza, 2019), and might also a good target. However, there are no specific highaffinity compounds that would inhibit this protein-protein interaction motif. Its association with the tandem PDZ domains of syntenin activates the MAP kinase p38, triggering the overexpression of inflammatory cytokines. Consequently, inhibition of p38 by SB203580 increases the survival of the host . Such more indirect targeting of the protein E function might also be considered for COVID-19 therapy."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Therapies to combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the lethality caused by the resulting COVID-2019 are currently focusing primarily on S, the viral spike protein (Kruse, 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020) . However, despite high similarities between proteins S between SARS and SARS-CoV-2 viruses, existing neutralizing antibodies are ineffective against SARS-CoV-2 (Wrapp et al., 2020) . Hence, new antibodies that bind specifically to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein need to be developed, tested, and approved for human use, which would be a time-consuming process. Our pangenomic analysis suggests that the protein E of all SARS viruses preserves its critical motifs used for pathogenesis, and should be considered as an alternative target to be tested for therapies to mitigate COVID-2019."}, {"section_title": "DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT", "text": "All datasets presented in this study are included in the article/Supplementary Material and https://pangenomedb.cbrc. kaust.edu.sa."}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": "IA, TG, and CD conceived and designed the research.
