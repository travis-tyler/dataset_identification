[{"section_title": "1", "text": "The large and persistent achievement gaps separating minority and non-minority students are arguably the most important educational problem in the United States. In particular, reducing or eliminating these gaps by raising the achievement of minority students is widely seen as a critical component of promoting broader social equality with respect to a variety of outcomes like educational attainment and earnings as well as crime, health and family structure (e.g., Christopher Jencks and Meredith Phillips 1998) . The more modest gender gaps in achievement are also viewed as a prominent policy concern, particularly with respect to the fields of science and mathematics (e.g., American Association of University Women 1992). The recent Federal legislation, the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act of 2001, clearly reflects these concerns, explicitly requiring that these demographic subgroups make \"adequate yearly progress\" towards proficiency on state tests.\nNCLB also emphasizes that schools should meet these and other goals by implementing effective reforms grounded in \"scientifically based\" research. However, the available empirical evidence suggests that the determinants of the demographic achievement gaps are not very well understood. For example, Jencks and Phillips (1998) argue that traditional explanations for the black-white achievement gaps (i.e., those based on income inequality, differences in family structure and school spending) actually have relatively little explanatory power. They also suggest that more successful future explanations of achievement gaps are likely to be based on credible data that assess more nuanced hypotheses about the dynamics within schools, classrooms and families.\nThe notion that the classroom dynamics between teachers and students make a substantive contribution to the demographic gaps in achievement already has a wide currency among educational researchers and commentators. For example, proposals for promoting racial and gender equity often emphasize the need for improvements in teacher training and professional development (e.g., Ronald F. Ferguson 1998 , American Association of University Women 1992). Another frequently recurring proposal for increasing the relative achievement of minority student is to improve the recruitment and retention of minority teachers (e.g., Beatriz\nChu Clewell and Ana Mar\u00eda Villegas 1998, National Commission on Teaching and America's Future 1996, Joint Center for Political Studies 1989 , Patricia A. Graham 1987 . However, the evidence that the demographic interactions between students and teachers matter is surprisingly thin, sometimes contradictory and usually based on small, localized samples.\nIn this study, I present new evidence on this issue by evaluating whether assignment to a demographically similar teacher influences the teacher's subjective evaluations of student behavior and performance. This analysis is based on a large, nationally representative survey, the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88). These data allow me to examine whether the effects of demographically similar teachers vary with key student traits or across Census regions. However, the key innovation of this analysis arguably involves how the identification strategy exploits a unique feature of the NELS:88 survey design to purge the potential biases created by the non-random sorting of students across and within schools.\nSpecifically, for each of the 8 th grade students surveyed, NELS:88 solicited student-specific evaluations from teachers in two distinct academic subjects. This unusual feature of the data makes it possible to implement a fixed effect econometric specification that essentially identifies how two demographically different teachers evaluated the same student.\nJeffrey M. Wooldridge (2002, page 492) cautions that it is misleading to state that this approach \"conditions\" on the unobserved fixed effects. Instead, this approach relies on describing a conditional density that allows us to identify the \"structural\" coefficients from the available data.\nNonetheless, I found that ordinary least-squares (OLS) estimates based on linear probability models that do condition on student fixed effects return results quite similar to those based on this approach. Table 2 presents the key results from fixed-effect logit models based on the full sample and for each of the three binary outcomes. Since this estimation strategy does not actually generate estimates of the student fixed effects, we cannot directly evaluate the partial effects of 1 One implication of this approach is that only the observations with within-student variation in the dependent variable contribute to the likelihood function. This explains why the sample sizes reported here are smaller than the total sample and vary across dependent variables."}, {"section_title": "I. Teacher-student interactions", "text": "The extant literature suggests two general ways that the demographic matches between students and teachers could influence educational outcomes. Ferguson (1998) concludes that biases in teacher perceptions and expectations \"help to sustain, and perhaps even to expand, the black-white test score gap.\" However, he also argues that this is a problem for both black and white teachers and dismisses recommendations to match students and teacher by race as \"too simple a prescription.\"\nHowever, other reviewers (e.g., Jacqueline Jordan Irvine 1988, Sabrina Hope King 1993) have pointed to several small studies, which find that white teachers are more likely than black teachers to have negative perceptions and low expectations of black students (e.g., Albert R.\nGriffin and Clement B.G. London 1979, Charles H. Beady Jr. and Stephen Hansell 1981).\nOne possible explanation for conflicting interpretations of this limited evidence is the unintended bias that can be created by the non-random sorting of teachers and students both across and within schools. For example, Ronald G. Erhenberg, Daniel D. Goldhaber and Dominic J. Brewer (1995) , in one of the few studies based on a large, nationally representative survey and a rich set of background controls, find relatively limited evidence that black students are evaluated more positively by black teachers. However, if minority students with a propensity or poor outcomes were more likely to be assigned to minority teachers, the true effect of a demographically similar teacher would be understated by those results. In this study, I present new empirical evidence that attempts to address this identification problem directly by exploiting the unusual panel nature of the NELS:88 data. This evidence does not directly distinguish among the passive and active effects described here. Instead, it provides reduced-form evidence on whether having a demographically similar teacher influences the teachers' perceptions of a student's performance and behavior."}, {"section_title": "II. Data and Specifications", "text": "The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) is a nationally representative, longitudinal study that began in 1988 with a sample of 24,599 8 th grade students from 1,052 public and private schools (Steven J. Ingels et al. 1990 ). NELS:88 had a two-stage sampling design. Schools, the primary sampling unit, were selected with probabilities proportional to their 8 th grade enrollment. Approximately 26 students were then randomly chosen within each participating school. NELS:88 also fielded questionnaires to the teachers responsible for teaching each of the selected students in two of four academic subjects: mathematics, science, reading, and social studies. The surveyed teachers were chosen by randomly assigning each school to one of four subject-area groupings: mathematics/reading, mathematics/social studies, science/reading, and science/social studies. Two completed teacher surveys are available for 21,324 of the 8 th grade students because of some non-response and because some students did not have a class in one or both of their assigned academic subjects. The final data set consists of 42,648 observations since the unit of observation is each teacher-student pairing.\nThe teacher survey included several questions about how the teacher perceived the classroom performance and personal traits of individual, sampled students. This analysis focuses on three pejorative teacher assessments (Table 1) : whether the student was seen as frequently disruptive (DISRUPT), consistently inattentive (INATTEN), or rarely completed homework (NOHWK). The use of subjective assessments like these raises at least two interpretative complications. One involves how these teacher perceptions relate to conventional measures of student achievement. Specifically, in this study, being perceived as disruptive or inattentive is viewed as a clearly undesirable outcome. However, it may be that a student becomes disruptive or inattentive to a particular teacher because they have mastered the classroom material relative to their peers. Fortunately, this complication does not appear to be empirically relevant. Students seen as disruptive or inattentive clearly have much lower levels of contemporaneous and subsequent achievement. Furthermore, the results based on subjective assessments which are not as subject to this ambiguity (e.g., not doing homework or being tardy to class) are similar to those based on these variables.\nA second potential complication is that teacher perceptions of student performance may reflect ex ante and race-specific biases in their expectations as well as the classroom interactions discussed earlier (i.e., role-model effects, stereotype threat and biases in teacher behavior). For example, it may be that majority teachers are less likely than minority teachers to view minority students as disruptive simply because they have lower expectations of those students.\nFortunately, the likely direction of the bias in this example does not fundamentally compromise this study's key inferences. For example, the results presented here indicate that minority students are more likely to be evaluated negatively by a demographically dissimilar teacher.\nTherefore, to the extent that these teacher perceptions reflect lower prior expectations, the results presented here merely understate the true influence of passive and active classroom interactions.\nIn order to identify the effects of demographically similar teachers, the students and teachers participating in NELS:88 were identified as belonging to one of four possible racial/ethnic categories: white (non-Hispanic), black (non-Hispanic), Hispanic and all others.\nThe binary indicators, OTHRACE and OTHSEX, identify students when observed by teachers who do not share their race or ethnicity or their gender ( Table 1 ). The sample mean for OTHRACE is 30 percent. However, it should be noted that the prevalence of OTHRACE varied quite sharply across minority and non-minority students. Only 6 percent of white non-Hispanic student observations were with teachers who were not white non-Hispanic. In contrast, 67 percent of the black students and 89 percent of the Hispanic students were with a teacher who did not share their race or ethnicity.\nThe ability to make within-student comparisons with these data makes it possible to eliminate the biases generated by unobserved student traits. The results presented here also condition on fixed effects for the subject in which the student is evaluated. However, racespecific patterns of unobserved teacher quality could quite reasonably bias these evaluations. For example, these evaluations would overstate the effects of OTHRACE on the performance of minority students if predominantly minority schools tended to attract relatively low-quality white teachers. To assess the empirical relevance of this issue, I present the results of some specifications that introduce controls for several observed teacher traits. These include separate binary indicators for having attended graduate school, for having a major (graduate or undergraduate) in the academic subject they are teaching and for having a minor in the academic subject they are teaching. There also 8 dummy variables that identify each teacher's years of experience (1 to 3 years, 4 to 6 years, etc.). Class size is also introduced as a control variable.\nPrior research suggests that some of these controls have surprisingly weak effects on student achievement (e.g., Andrew J. Wayne and Peter Youngs 2003) . However, these variables are jointly significant determinants of all three of these dependent variables, with teacher experience having particularly strong effects. Furthermore, since some teachers provided evaluations of several different students, it is possible to evaluate the effects of demographically similar teachers in linear probability models that include both student and teacher fixed effects. The results of that approach are quite similar to those reported here.\nSpecifically, the results presented here are based on a fixed-effects logit that accommodates both the presence of student fixed effects and the binary nature of the dependent variables. A key feature of this approach is a conditional likelihood function that effectively removes student fixed effects from the estimation procedure (e.g., Badi H. Baltagi 2001)."}, {"section_title": "III. Results", "text": "the independent variables on the response probabilities. However, the magnitude of the estimated coefficients can be interpreted by converting them to odds ratios: the estimated factor by which an independent variable influences the odds of a particular outcome. 2 So, for example, the results in the first row of Table 2 indicate that the odds of a student being seen as disruptive by a teacher are 1.36 times as large when the teacher does not share the student's racial/ethnic designation.\nThese odds ratios are quite consistent with the marginal effects implied by similarly specified linear probability models."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "The other results in Table 2 indicate that OTHRACE has similarly large and statistically significant effects on the other teacher perceptions. More specifically, a teacher who does not share a student's racial/ethnic designation increases the odds of being seen as inattentive by at least 33 percent and the odds of rarely completing homework by at least 22 percent. The estimated effects of OTHSEX are similarly sized and statistically significant. The odds that a student was perceived as inattentive or disruptive are respectively at least 19 and 38 percent higher when the teacher is of the opposite gender. And the odds that a teacher will report that a student rarely completes homework are 15 percent higher when their genders do not match.\nInterestingly, Hausman tests comparing the results of all these fixed-effect logit models to those from conventional logit models that are otherwise similarly specified indicate that there are statistically significant differences. These comparisons suggest that acknowledging the unobserved student fixed effects does lead to more reliable inferences. The results in Table 2 also indicate that the estimated effects of OTHRACE and OTHSEX are very similar in specifications that introduce controls for teacher observables and class size. In fact, including these controls 2 The odds ratio equals e \u03b2 so the absence of an effect (i.e., \u03b2=0) implies an odds ratio of 1 (i.e., e \u03b2 = e 0 = 1). The zstatistics reported in the parentheses correspond to the null hypothesis of no effect.\neither leaves these estimated effects unchanged or increases them slightly. This pattern of results suggests that the effects identified here reflect racial, gender and ethnic dynamics between students and teachers and are not biased by any demographic patterns in unobserved teacher quality.\nThe results in Table 2 provide evidence that the racial/ethnic and gender dynamics within classrooms have substantive effects on how individual students are perceived by their teachers.\nOne novel feature of these inferences is that they use the panel nature of the NELS:88 data to purge the inconsistency that could be imparted by unobserved student effects. However, as noted earlier, two other possibly valuable features of these data are that the sample size is relatively large and the data are nationally representative. These aspects of the data make it possible to examine how the effects of OTHRACE and OTHSEX might vary by student traits as well as across different regions of the United States. The results presented in Tables 3, 4 and 5 provide some evidence on the pattern of response heterogeneities for each of the three dependent variables.\nFor example, these results generally suggest that both white and minority (i.e., black and Hispanic) students are likely to be perceived more negatively by a teacher who does not share their racial/ethnic designation. However, the results in Table 4 also indicate that minority students are particularly likely to be seen as inattentive by an OTHRACE teacher. The effects of OTHRACE teachers are more consistently stark across students with high and low socioeconomic status. Among students with low socioeconomic status, the odds of being seen negatively are 35 to 57 percent higher when evaluated by an OTHRACE teacher. In contrast, these effects, though positive, are consistently smaller and statistically insignificant among students with high socioeconomic status. The results in these three tables also indicate that the effects of an OTHSEX teacher are consistently positive but relatively similar across students with varying racial/ethnic designations and socioeconomic status. Tables 2, 3 and 4 indicate how the estimated effects of OTHRACE and OTHSEX differ across the four Census regions. In each of these regions, teachers who did not share a student's gender were significantly more likely to view the student as disruptive. Similarly, the estimated effects of OTHSEX on the odds of being seen as inattentive were similarly large and statistically significant in three of the four regions. However, the estimated effect of OTHSEX on teacher perceptions of NOHWK was statistically significant only in the South. In contrast, the geographic differences in the estimated effects of an OTHRACE teacher are more consistently stark. More specifically, the effects of OTHRACE on all three teacher perceptions were statistically significant only in the South. The estimated magnitudes of these effects are quite large. For example, OTHRACE increased the odds that a student would be seen as disruptive and inattentive by 83 percent and 60 percent, respectively."}, {"section_title": "The remaining results in", "text": "Evaluations that distinguish among the white and minority students in the South suggest that the OTHRACE on teacher perceptions are positive for both groups. However, the resulting loss of statistical precision qualifies these within-region comparisons."}, {"section_title": "IV. Conclusions", "text": "The results presented here indicate that the racial, ethnic and gender dynamics between students and teachers have consistently large effects on teacher perceptions of student performance. However, the effects associated with race and ethnicity appear to be concentrated among students of low socioeconomic status and those in the South. Since these teacher perceptions are clearly likely to influence educational opportunities as well as the classroom environment, this evidence implies that these classroom interactions make important contributions to the observed demographic gaps in student achievement. The most widely recommended policy responses to these sorts of effects are arguably the ones that involve recruiting underrepresented teachers. One clear benefit of this approach is that it does not require a clear understanding of the extent to which the effects documented here are driven by passive responses (e.g., role-model effects and stereotype threat) or active biases in student or teacher behaviors. However, the results presented here also indicate that this approach could have the unintended and undesirable consequence of harming students who do not share the teacher's demographic traits.\nThis criticism suggests that alternative policies that improve the effectiveness of all teachers may be a relatively attractive way to close achievement gaps. For example, Ferguson (1998) recommends the implementation of more sophisticated programs of professional development for teachers as well as well-designed performance incentives. Steele (1997) recommends \"wise\" schooling practices and programs that negate the stereotype threats experienced by students through an optimistic emphasis on their potential and the offer of challenges instead of remediation. Policies of this broad nature do appear to offer a particularly promising way to promote the demographic neutrality of student-teacher interactions. However, the exact design and emphasis of such policies also requires a clear understanding of the underlying structural mechanisms that make these student-teacher interactions relevant in the first place. For example, student-focused programs designed to negate stereotype threat would be relatively ineffective if the dominant problem involves biases in teacher behaviors. Similarly, if stereotype threat is the main source of the effects presented here, teacher training unrelated to those passive effects would also be ineffectual. Future research that illuminates the nature of these student-teacher dynamics will provide a particularly useful guide to sensible public policy.
