Three hundred thirty-two participants (mean [SD] age, 74.6 [7.4] years; 118 women) of a total of 374 participants diagnosed as having mild cognitive impairment were included. Participants were excluded if they did not have longitudinal data, apolipoprotein E genotype data, or had evidence of supratentorial infarct.\nA decline in Mini-Mental State Examination score of 3 points over 6 months or 6 points over 1 year between consecutive visits was defined as aggressive decline. White matter hyperintensity volume and ECV were entered as predictors in Cox proportional hazards models and Wilcoxon-Breslow tests to examine their impact on this outcome, adjusting for sex, age, education, and apolipoprotein E status.\nGreater WMH volume at baseline, apolipoprotein E \u03b54 status, and smaller ECV at baseline were associated with an increased risk for aggressive decline (hazard ratio [HR], 1.23; 95% CI, 1.05-1.43; P = .01 for WMH volume; HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.09-2.05; P = .04 for apolipoprotein E \u03b54 status; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55-0.79; P < .001 for ECV). White matter hyperintensity volume modified the effect of ECV on aggressive decline risk: individuals with high ECV and low WMH were at particularly low likelihood of decline (\u03c7 2 = 15, P = .001).\nParticipants with Mini-Mental State Examination scores that declined by 3 or more points over 6 months or 6 or more points over 12 months were more likely to have converted to Alzheimer disease by the end of the follow-up period (\u03c7 2 = 82, P < .001).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE White matter hyperintensity burden and ECV predict rapid cognitive decline among individuals with mild cognitive impairment both additively and multiplicatively."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "D espite contemporary models of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathogenesis, which emphasize the precipitating role of \u03b2-amyloid and subsequent neurodegenerative changes due to tau pathology, 1 small-vessel cerebrovascular disease has emerged as an important driver of risk and clinical expression of the disease. We previously showed that individuals with prevalent AD and those at risk for AD have an increased burden of small-vessel cerebrovascular changes, visualized as increased white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 2 Increased WMH burden also predicts incident AD 3 and individuals with evidence of amyloidosis are more likely to exhibit symptoms of dementia if they have substantial WMH burden. 4 The degree to which WMH burden contributes to clinically meaningful decline in individuals at risk for AD remains an important question.\nThe diagnostic category of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) refers to the intermediate stage of a 3-part journey that begins with normal cognitive aging and ends with dementia due to AD. 5 Individuals with MCI have objective evidence of cognitive impairment but without the functional impairment that interferes with their daily activities. 5 When clinically defined, there is much heterogeneity in the rate of cognitive decline among individuals with MCI, with some progressing quite precipitously while others remain cognitively stable and functionally unimpaired. 6 Work that has examined clinical outcomes in MCI tends to focus on conversion to AD, where the threshold between the two is defined by a switch from a functionally unimpaired state to a cognitive syndrome defined by functional impairment."}, {"section_title": "7", "text": "The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 8 is one of the most common tools used by clinicians to follow up patients' progression over time. Many efforts to classify progression rates in MCI, as well as AD stages, relied on the MMSE and showed great heterogeneity, possibly owing to real individual difference in progression rates, biased sampling in terms of baseline characteristics, and/or floor and ceiling effects of the scales administrated. Operational definitions of MMSE decline thresholds to assess the rapidity or aggressiveness of progression have been long debated: declines of 3 points over 1 year, 9 4 or 7 points over 1 year, 10 and 3 points over 6 months 11 have been proposed as classification criteria. However, confusion exists not only in terms of cutoffs, but also regarding baseline level of impairment and observational periods; previous studies applied these thresholds to a wide range of baseline MMSE scores 11, 12 including mild to moderate AD across a large range of follow-up periods (MMSE decline in 6 to 24 months, 12 escalating cognitive impairment in 3 years, 13 or survival time of less than 4 years 14 ). A recent study, based on extensive review of previous studies, 15 suggested that a decline of 6 points per year on the MMSE should be used as the optimal threshold to define rapidly progressive AD.\nRegardless of the threshold chosen, the value of this approach is that it clusters patients within discrete classes of progression by defining a rapid event as an MMSE point decline that deviates from what is the average point decline in AD (2.5 per year) and obviously in MCI (1 per year). This approach may be ideal for clinical practice because it provides an operational definition that can be applied to an individual patient.\nThe purpose of this study was to examine whether WMHs predict the rapidity of cognitive decline in MCI as measured by clinically defined categorical changes in MMSE scores over time. We hypothesized that WMH burden would predict clinical outcomes independent of a measure of entorhinal cortex atrophy, a putative biological marker of neurodegeneration due to AD, 1, 16 and apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54, a well-known genetic risk factor for AD.

The ADNI is the result of efforts of many coinvestigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and participants have been recruited from more than 50 sites across the United States and Canada. The initial goal of the ADNI was to recruit 800 participants but the ADNI has been followed by ADNI GO (Grand Opportunity) and ADNI 2.

The follow-up duration of each group is specified in the protocols for ADNI 1, ADNI 2, and ADNI GO. Participants originally recruited for ADNI 1 and ADNI GO had the option to be followed up in ADNI 2.

We also confirmed that diminished ECV, a marker of neurodegeneration associated with AD, predicts an aggressive course with similar magnitude. Importantly, the 2 biological markers interact such that individuals with large ECV and a small amount of WMH burden appear to have synergistically diminished risk for decline. This latter finding suggests a mechanistic interaction between the 2 pathologic markers on clinical course.\nA diagnosis of MCI increases individuals' risk for future development of AD, but it is not synonymous with a diagnosis of early AD. Indeed, several individuals with MCI do not ultimately convert to AD or have a precipitous clinical decline. 27 However, the design of the ADNI study included individuals with late MCI thought to be at high risk to develop clinical AD.\nThe question of what factors have prognostic use in determining which individuals diagnosed as having MCI have a precipitous clinical event through their follow-up is critical to both clinicians making the MCI diagnosis and to the individuals receiving the diagnosis. Here, we showed that the burden of WMH is a reliable predictor of which patients, diagnosed as having MCI at baseline, will decline with an aggressive clinical course. We purposefully focused on a psychometrically defined criterion for aggressive course rather than, for example, conversion to AD, to parallel explicitly outcomes that are common in clinical settings where research diagnostic procedures (eg, amyloid imaging and cerebrospinal studies) are less available. Nonetheless, we recognize that aggressive course in MCI overlaps to a certain extent with conversion to AD and demonstrated that those who had a more precipitous decline were indeed more likely to carry an AD diagnosis on follow-up examination.\nTo capture important prognostic information, we applied an operational cutoff that defines an aggressive decline in cognitive performance during a narrow observational window in participants at risk for or in the very early stages of the disease. Previous research has applied a similar approach to a wide range of AD severity. For example, Doody and colleagues 28 showed that estimated progression rates prior to enrollment in the study (computed with the formula [30 \u2212 baseline MMSE score] / year since symptom onset) predicted future changes in cognition, activities of daily living, and mortality. The baseline measure identified slow-, intermediate-, and fastprogressing groups and reliable differences among the 3 groups persisted or increased even on a long-term follow-up observation. The MMSE has a well-known floor effect among patients with prevalent AD 29 ; thus, its use in detecting dementia progression is somewhat limited among more impaired patients. By examining patients with MCI in the current study, we avoided the problem of floor effects.\nOur observations add to a growing body of literature that implicates WMH in the clinical course and, possibly, pathogenesis of AD. In community-based studies, we previously showed that WMH volume is elevated in individuals with MCI 2 and AD, 30 predicts future incident AD among nondemented older adults, 3 progresses over time in individuals with incident AD, and predicts the rate of cognitive decline among individuals with prevalent AD. 31 Our previous efforts in the ADNI showed that among individuals with evidence of amyloidosis, those with elevated WMH were more likely to meet clinical criteria for AD than those with lower amounts of WMH. 4 We also showed that WMH volume is correlated with the degree of atrophy in the entorhinal cortex among individuals with MCI. 32 Here, we extend those findings and suggest that medial temporal lobe atrophy, reflecting neurodegeneration, and WMHs may interact mechanistically or result from a common upstream driver. Whether the relationship between WMH and neurodegenerative changes is fundamental or epiphenomenological may still be up for debate; however, what is clear is that WMHs at least contribute additively to clinical course in the context of other AD biological markers."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Our findings demonstrate that both WMH and ECV predict rapid progression in the early stages of the disease and interact synergistically. The findings may be useful for prognosis of outcomes, especially in clinical settings, but also contribute to a growing body of work that implicates small-vessel cerebrovascular disease in AD pathogenesis and clinical expression. Furthermore, because many of the risk factors for WMH have been established and are modifiable through lifestyle or pharmacological intervention, our findings suggest avenues for prevention or treatment of rapid-progressing course among patients with MCI."}]
