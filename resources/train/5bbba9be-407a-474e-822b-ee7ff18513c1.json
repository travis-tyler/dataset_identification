[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract We present measurements of pCO 2 , O 2 concentration, biological oxygen saturation (\u0394O 2 /Ar), and N 2 saturation (\u0394N 2 ) in Southern Ocean surface waters during austral summer, 2010-2011. Phytoplankton biomass varied strongly across distinct hydrographic zones, with high chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations in regions of frontal mixing and sea ice melt. pCO 2 and \u0394O 2 /Ar exhibited large spatial gradients (range 90 to 450 \u03bcatm and \u00c010 to 60%, respectively) and covaried strongly with Chl a. However, the ratio of biological O 2 accumulation to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) drawdown was significantly lower than expected from photosynthetic stoichiometry, reflecting the differential time scales of O 2 and CO 2 air-sea equilibration. We measured significant oceanic CO 2 uptake, with a mean air-sea flux (~\u00c010 mmol m \u00c02 d\n) that significantly exceeded regional climatological values. N 2 was mostly supersaturated in surface waters (mean \u0394N 2 of +2.5%), while physical processes resulted in both supersaturation and undersaturation of mixed layer O 2 (mean \u0394O 2phys = 2.1%). Box model calculations were able to reproduce much of the spatial variability of \u0394N 2 and \u0394O 2phys along the cruise track, demonstrating significant effects of air-sea exchange processes (e.g., atmospheric pressure changes and bubble injection) and mixed layer entrainment on surface gas disequilibria.

This vast region contributes significantly to oceanic CO 2 uptake through the vertical export of particulate organic carbon [Honjo et al., 2008; Schlitzer, 2002; Trull et al., 2001] and the subduction of CO 2 -rich polar water masses into the ocean interior [Caldeira and Duffy, 2000; Sarmiento and Toggweiler, 1984] . These biological and physical carbon pumps also transport oxygen and macronutrients into the low latitudes, where they influence biological productivity over large spatial scales [Marinov et al., 2006; Sarmiento et al., 2004] . In the offshore pelagic realm, Southern Ocean primary production and biological CO 2 uptake appear to be controlled by a combination of light and iron limitation [Boyd, 2002] . Large-scale patterns of aeolian iron deposition have been linked to spatial gradients in surface water productivity [Cassar et al., 2007] , while vertical mixing at frontal zones has been shown to drive mesoscale and submesoscale biological gradients [Sokolov and Rintoul, 2007] . Relative to the open ocean, field data are sparse over much of the Antarctic continental shelf and marginal ice zone (MIZ), where productivity is influenced by iron input from sediments [Coale et al., 2005; Planquette et al., 2013] and melting ice [Gerringa et al., 2012; Sedwick and DiTullio, 1997] and by large seasonal cycles in solar irradiance, mixed layer depth, and sea ice cover [Arrigo and van Dijken, 2003] . Although these high-latitude regions contribute disproportionately (on an areal basis) to Southern Ocean nutrient and carbon cycles [Arrigo et al., 2008] , their biological and physical dynamics remain poorly described.\nobservations to characterize the spatial variability of surface gases in contrasting Southern Ocean regions (offshore pelagic, continental shelf, and MIZ) and to examine the relative influence of physical versus biological controls on biogeochemical processes. The interplay of physical and biological forcing is particularly important in determining surface water pCO 2 and O 2 distributions. Net community production (NCP, i.e., gross photosynthesis minus community respiration) leads to CO 2 drawdown (i.e., decreased pCO 2 ) in the mixed layer, coupled with biologically induced O 2 supersaturation [Carrillo et al., 2004] . NCP is sensitive to physical factors (e.g., wind speed, solar irradiance, and ice cover) that control nutrient supply and mixed layer light intensity. Physical processes also influence surface O 2 and CO 2 by modulating the strength of diffusive air-sea exchange, which acts to restore gas concentrations back to atmospheric equilibrium, and bubble processes, which lead to supersaturation of surface water gases [Keeling, 1993] . Due to chemical buffering of the inorganic C system in seawater, the diffusive air-sea equilibration time scale is typically approximately tenfold slower for CO 2 than for O 2 [Sarmiento and Gruber, 2006] , and gas exchange can thus overprint the biological production signal, shifting the pCO 2 -O 2 relationship away from photosynthetic stoichiometry [Kortzinger et al., 2008] .\nChanges in surface water temperature and salinity can also influence O 2 and CO 2 distributions through their effect on gas solubility. For O 2 , these thermodynamic effects can be removed by normalization to argon, a biologically inert gas with solubility properties that are virtually identical to O 2 . The O 2 /Ar ratio thus serves as a specific tracer for biological O 2 cycling [Craig and Hayward, 1987] , and recent field measurements of O 2 /Ar disequilibrium (\u0394O 2 /Ar) have been used to map the large-scale spatial distribution of NCP in Southern Ocean surface waters [Cassar et al., 2011; Castro-Morales et al., 2013; Reuer et al., 2007; Shadwick et al., 2014; Tortell and Long, 2009] . NCP estimates derived from \u0394O 2 /Ar measurements are based on a steady state mixed layer model [Kaiser et al., 2005; Reuer et al., 2007] , where vertical and lateral exchange of O 2 into the mixed layer is assumed to be negligible and NCP can thus be equated to the biologically induced sea-air flux of O 2 (O 2 bioflux). These assumptions are likely invalid over significant portions of the Southern Ocean, where vertical entrainment of biologically modified subsurface waters leads to significant uncertainty in derived mixed layer NCP values [Jonsson et al., 2013] . Better constraints on the physical contributions to mixed layer O 2 mass balance are thus needed to improve the use of \u0394O 2 /Ar as a productivity tracer.\nLike Ar, N 2 is biologically inert in the Southern Ocean, where nitrogen fixation and denitrification are inhibited by high NO 3 \u00c0 and O 2 concentrations, respectively. Given the high atmospheric concentrations of N 2 and its relatively low solubility in seawater, this gas provides a useful tracer for air-sea exchange processes, including bubble injection [Schudlich and Emerson, 1996] . A number of studies have used surface ocean N 2 disequilibrium measurements (\u0394N 2 ) to examine air-sea exchange [Emerson et al., 2002; Hamme and Emerson, 2006; Vagle et al., 2010] , and a mechanistic framework has recently been developed to quantitatively interpret surface N 2 data [Liang et al., 2013; Nicholson et al., 2008 Nicholson et al., , 2011 Stanley et al., 2009] . At present, we are aware of only one published \u0394N 2 data set from Southern Ocean waters [Weeding and Trull, 2014] . Additional \u0394N 2 measurements from this region are thus needed to validate the model-based calculations under conditions of high wind speeds, strong gradients in atmospheric pressure and significant bubble injection fluxes.\nUsing simultaneous measurements of N 2 , O 2 , \u0394O 2 /Ar, and CO 2 , in combination with ancillary data and box model calculations, we examined the dominant controls on surface gas saturation states in contrasting Southern Ocean surface waters. Our results provide insight into the factors driving gas dynamics in various subregions of the Southern Ocean, demonstrating clear regional differences in the relative importance of physical and biological forcing. Our observations reveal strong biological controls on surface CO 2 and O 2 distributions, with a significant imprint of air-sea exchange. Using box model calculations, we show that the formulation of Nicholson et al. [2011] is able to provide reasonable estimates of physically induced changes in O 2 and N 2 saturation states, and we derive NCP estimates that are corrected for entrainment of biologically modified subsurface waters into the mixed layer. Our work builds on the recent studies of Shadwick et al. [2014] examining CO 2 , O 2 , and \u0394O 2 /Ar along a transect south of Australia and Weeding and Trull [2014] , who present a mooring-based O 2 and N 2 time series for the Sub-Antarctic region south of Tasmania. To our knowledge, our work represents the first simultaneous measurements of pCO 2 , \u0394O 2 , \u0394O 2 /Ar, and \u0394N 2 for the Southern Ocean, and we show how these combined observations can provide powerful insights into surface water biogeochemical processes across a range of hydrographic regimes."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Site and Hydrographic Measurements", "text": "We conducted a 10 week survey of Southern Ocean waters from 29 November 2010 to 3 February 2011 on board the research vessel Polarstern (cruise ANT-XXVII/2; [Rohardt et al., 2011] ). Our cruise track from Cape Town, South Africa, to Punta Arenas, Chile (Figure 1 ), encompassed a number of distinct hydrographic regimes. For the purposes of our analysis, we separate the cruise track into three subregions. We first sampled a N-S transect~40\u00b0S to 70\u00b0S, crossing a number of prominent hydrographic fronts [Orsi et al., 1995] , including the Subtropical Front (STF), Sub-Antarctic Front (SAF), Polar Front (PF), Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF), and Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (SBdy). We then followed an E-W transect along the outer edge of the Weddell Sea MIZ and conducted an intensive survey of the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) along the Palmer Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sampling grid [Waters and Smith, 1992] .\nSea surface temperature (SST) and salinity (SSS) were measured continuously along the cruise track using an onboard thermosalinograph (TSG; Sea-Bird Electronics, model SBE-21) sampling from an uncontaminated seawater supply with a nominal intake depth of 11 m. Daily calibrations of the TSG salinity measurements were conducted using discrete samples analyzed on a salinometer (Optimare GmbH, Precision Salinometer). Sea surface Chl a fluorescence, used as a proxy for bulk phytoplankton biomass, was continuously measured by the ship's underway fluorometer (WET labs, ECO). The fluorometer data were not calibrated to absolute Chl a concentrations and are thus used here only as a relative measure of total phytoplankton abundance. Some daytime nonphotochemical quenching of Chl a fluorescence is expected, independent of changes in phytoplankton biomass.\nDepth profiles of seawater potential temperature, salinity, and Chl a fluorescence were obtained from conductivitytemperature-depth (CTD) casts at 188 stations along the cruise track. Temperature and conductivity were measured with Sea-Bird SBE3plus and SBE4 sensors, respectively, while Chl a fluorescence was measured with a WET labs ECO fluorometer. Temperature and salinity profiles were used to define the mixed layer depth for each station based on the curvature of near-surface layer density or temperature profiles as described by Lorbacher et al. [2006] . Mixed layer temperature and salinity data derived from CTD casts showed very good agreement with surface TSG data (mean offset of \u00c00.078\u00b0C and \u00c00.01, respectively). The concentration of O 2 in depth profiles was measured using a CTD-mounted Sea-Bird SBE43 sensor. The CTD O 2 sensor was calibrated using Winkler titrations of discrete samples, with visual endpoint determination using a starch indicator (precision of 0.3 \u03bcmol L"}, {"section_title": "\u00c01", "text": ") and KIO 3 standardization of the thiosulfate titration solutions [Dickson, 1994] . All of the CTD sensors were sent to the manufacturer for calibration prior to and immediately after the cruise. Full quality-controlled hydrographic data from the cruise are available in the Pangaea database (www.pangaea.de).\n, this sampling frequency translates into one measurement every~200 m along the cruise [1995] . N-S, E-W, and WAP denote different portions of our sampling region, as described in the text. Grey/black shading around the Antarctic continent represents the mean sea ice cover during the period of our survey, derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) satellite product.\n). Although there was a slight offset toward lower wind speeds in the NCEP data, the mean difference (\u00c00.94 m s \u00c01 \u00b1 3.11) was not significantly different from zero.

[2007] , \u03b1 CO2 is the temperature and salinity-dependent solubility of CO 2 [Weiss, 1974] , and A is the fraction of sea surface covered by ice. The exponential term used to scale gas exchange as a function of ice cover is derived from Loose et al. [2009] . For these flux calculations, we used an atmospheric CO 2 mole fraction of 396 ppmv, derived from the GlobalView pCO 2 data (www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/globalview/; 60\u00b0S to 70\u00b0S, December 2010 to February 2011), corrected to 100% humidity at SST and SSS and the atmospheric pressure derived from ship-based sensors. Wind speeds used for the flux calculations were derived from 1 week averages of the NCEP reanalysis product, matched to the ship's position along the cruise track.\n. Seawater (500 mL) for dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) analysis was collected in borosilicate glass bottles and analyzed within 20 h using a VINDTA 3C instrument (Versatile INstrument for the Determination of Total Alkalinity, Marianda, Kiel). The DIC concentration was determined by coulometric analysis [Johnson et al., 1987] , with calibration against certified reference materials (CRM, batches 100 and 105) performed at the start and end of each measurement cycle. The precision of the DIC measurements was 1.0 \u03bcmol kg\n, based on the average difference between all CRM in-bottle duplicate analyses (n = 87), and the accuracy was estimated as 2.0 \u03bcmol kg\n. Depth-integrated DIC deficits were calculated from vertical profiles relative to the concentration at the depth of the potential temperature minimum, representing the Winter Water. The depth of the potential temperature minimum was determined from the CTD profiles. Vertical integration to the potential temperature minimum was used to derive the chemical deficits in the summer surface layer. DIC data were normalized to average Winter Water salinity (34.2, n = 105) to account for dilution through addition of sea ice meltwater. The chemical deficits, calculated in this way, represent the time-integrated change of the surface ocean since the end of the winter. This technique assumes that DIC concentrations at the potential temperature minimum represent the winter reference with no significant lateral or vertical exchange. This assumption has been used in prior studies [Hoppema et al., 2007; Jennings et al., 1984; Rubin et al., 1998 ] and appears to be reasonably robust for the Weddell Sea [Hoppema et al., 2000b] .\nIn order to obtain high spatial resolution surface carbonate system data along the cruise track, we derived an empirical linear relationship between salinity and alkalinity along the E-W and WAP transects (n = 2098, r 2 > 0.85, root-mean-square error = 6.1 \u03bcmol kg \u00c01 ) and used this relationship to compute alkalinity from thermosalinograph salinity measurements. Total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) along the cruise track was then computed from measured pCO 2 and the derived alkalinity using CO2SYS [Pierrot et al., 2006] , with the equilibrium constants of Mehrbach et al. [1973] refit by Dickson and Millero [1987] . For the WAP and Weddell regions, the root-mean-square error of the DIC estimates derived from this analysis was 7.1\nGlobal Biogeochemical Cycles 10.1002/2014GB004975 and 3.8 \u03bcmol kg\n, respectively. This error term was based on a comparison of DIC values obtained using measured versus empirically derived alkalinity.\n) given in Nicholson et al. [2011] were derived for average wind speeds. For our calculations based on short-term wind speeds, we use a flux enhancement factor, R, of 1.5 as discussed in Nicholson et al. [2011] . The bubble fluxes F inj and F ex scale with whitecap coverage (0 for u 10 < 2.27).\nThe entrainment term is governed by the change in mixed layer depth (only deepening of the mixed layer impacts the surface water budget) and by difference between mixed layer concentration c x and the concentration in the subsurface layer c x,sub :\nThe changes in mixed layer depth used to quantify the physical entrainment term were obtained from temperature and salinity profiles of the Mercator global operational system PSY3V3. These modelderived mixed layer depths, which assimilate all available measurements in a given study region, showed reasonable agreement with values obtained from our actual CTD observations (r = 0.61) and were able to reproduce the spatial patterns in mixing depths across our cruise track ( Figure S1 in the supporting information). Moreover, comparison of the time-dependent model MLD history, with observations derived from Argo float data showed that the model output was able to reproduce the significant changes in MLD (including a number of pronounced deepening events) observed across our study region ( Figure S2 ).\nFor N 2 , the choice of the submixed layer concentration c N2 ;sub has a minor influence on the calculation given the weak vertical gradients of this gas in the absence of a subsurface biological production or consumption term. We thus chose a uniform value of 100% surface saturation for c N2 ;sub . In the case of O 2 , however, strong vertical gradients and variable saturation levels have a significant influence on the entrainment term, and the choice of c O2 ;sub values can thus exert a significant influence on the model calculations under conditions of mixed layer deepening. Given our interest in comparing physical and biological processes affecting the surface water O 2 balance, we computed two different O 2 entrainment terms. The first term, \u0394O 2pe , reflects the entrainment of subsurface waters in the absence of a biological signature. For this calculations the subsurface O 2 end-member (c O2 ;sub ) was set to 100%, as in the N 2 calculations. We also computed a total Global Biogeochemical Cycles\n) and MLD (26 m) observed across the survey region. In contrast, disequilibria in pCO 2 , which is buffered by the seawater carbonate system, can persist for many weeks and even months in the surface mixed layer . The degree of uncoupling between CO 2 and O 2 in the mixed layer should thus provide insight into temporal evolution of biological productivity in surface waters. Regions where the biological production signal is \"older\" should exhibit a higher degree of CO 2 -O 2 uncoupling. In our data set, the lower O 2 -DIC slope in the WAP region (0.33 versus 0.45 for the E-W transect; Figure 4) suggests that the production signal was integrated over a longer time interval. Indeed, remote sensing data show the presence of phytoplankton blooms in the WAP for over 2 months prior to our sampling (see Figure 8b and Global Biogeochemical Cycles 10.1002/2014GB004975 section 3.6). In contrast, much of the biological production along the E-W region occurred following recent ice retreat, with shorter time interval for gas exchange to uncouple O 2 and DIC. Similar observations on the timedependent coupling of CO 2 and O 2 coupling have been recently reported by Shadwick et al. [2014] although these authors did not present derived O 2 and DIC concentrations.\n), whereas our measurements show mean oceanic uptake of 10 (\u00b15.8) mmol m \u00c02 d\n. In January, the climatological CO 2 flux is \u00c02.4 \u00b1 0.92 mmol m \u00c02 d\n, compared to \u00c09.9 \u00b1 4.2 mmol m \u00c02 d \u00c01 derived from our measurements. The climatology represents a mean value derived from many years of observations, and some interannual variability is expected. During our survey, we measured significantly higher air-sea CO 2 disequilibria than are present in the climatology; for December and January, respectively, we observed an average \u0394CO 2 of \u00c091 and \u00c0108 \u03bcatm, compared to the climatological values of~+17 and \u00c039 \u03bcatm. These differences are likely too large to represent simple interannual variability and likely reflect real differences in the underlying distribution of data. Our results thus suggest significantly higher oceanic CO 2 uptake in high-latitude Antarctic waters than is represented by the global climatology. Similar observations have been reported in previous studies [Arrigo et al., 2008; Bellerby et al., 2004; Hoppema et al., 2000a] . Note that the apparent difference in sea-air CO 2 fluxes between our observations and the climatology is approximately twofold larger if we compute the fluxes using ship-based winds as opposed to the weekly averaged NCEP reanalysis product.\nHigh-latitude Antarctic waters, and the MIZ in particular, should be effective at sequestering CO 2 from the atmosphere due to the coupling of biological productivity with sea ice dynamics. As observed in our study and that of previous authors [Bakker et al., 2008; Jones et al., 2010] , ice retreat leads to enhanced phytoplankton biomass and strong CO 2 uptake. Previous studies have shown that much of the CO 2 taken up by spring phytoplankton growth can effectively be sequestered into subsurface layers during late summer cooling and the return of ice cover at the end of the growing season [Sweeney, 2003] . Late season sea ice cover acts to limit outgassing of high CO 2 during the net heterotrophic period of the annual growing season, enhancing the CO 2 sequestration efficiency of surface waters. For this reason, Antarctic continental shelf waters are likely to contribute disproportionately to Southern Ocean CO 2 uptake [Arrigo et al., 2008] . Inclusion of more data from these regions into updated climatologies (with finer-scale grid cell resolution, and greater seasonal data coverage) could lead to revised estimates of Southern Ocean CO 2 uptake, with significant implications for the global C budget.\n) and/or decreasing atmospheric pressure along the northern portion of the N-S transect (in the SACCF region), the Weddell Sea continental margin and the northern WAP (Figure 6 ). In some cases (e.g., 11,000 km cruise track distance), strong N 2 supersaturation was associated with recent warming of the mixed layer and decreased gas solubility. The maximum \u0394N 2 values we observed are significantly higher than those reported previously for midlatitude oceanic regions [Emerson et \nDecember \u00c010.0 \u00b1 5.8 \u00c091 \u00b1 59 1.4 \u00b1 0.9 17 \u00b1 11 January \u00c09.9 \u00b1 4.2 \u00c0108 \u00b1 24 \u00c02.4 \u00b1 0.9 \u00c039 \u00b1 14 a Average fluxes from MIMS data were derived from values binned into 4\u00b0\u00d7 5\u00b0boxes to match the resolution of the climatology. Averages reported for the climatology were obtained from grid cells containing MIMS data.\n, respectively. The low mean NCP value for the WAP region seems initially surprising, given the extremely elevated NCP observed at~11,000 km along the cruise track. Outside of this one productivity hot spot, however, much of the WAP region had relatively low (and in some cases even negative) NCP. Excluding the negative values, the mean NCP value in the WAP is 48 mmol O 2 m \u00c02 d\n. By comparison, exclusion of negative NCP values from the E-W transect only increased The red crosses in Figure 8a represent NCP estimated from seasonal DIC deficits in the mixed layer. Vertical blue patches in Figure 8a show frontal regions. The black line in Figure 8b shows the location of the research vessel, while white patches denote sea ice cover. Note the logarithmic scaling of the Chl a axis.\nGlobal Biogeochemical Cycles are among the highest reported for the Southern Ocean, yet these values are not without precedent. Recent time series work at the Palmer Station LTER site along the WAP [Tortell et al., 2014] show maximum NCP values similar to the highest values we observed along the WAP region of our cruise track. Independent NCP estimates, based on calculated seasonal DIC deficits at discrete sampling stations, showed good general coherence with our \u0394O 2 /Ar-derived values. Both the spatial distribution and range of NCP values were similar for the two methods. The agreement between the two estimates was particularly good in the WAP region (unfortunately, DIC samples were not collected in the vicinity of Marguerite Bay, where the highest NCP values were observed), and also south of the SBdy frontal zone along the N-S transect. In contrast, there were apparent offsets between the two NCP estimates in the vicinity of the PF and in the highest productivity regions of the E-W transit. In addition to the uncertainties discussed above for \u0394O 2 /Ar-derived NCP, NCP estimates from DIC deficits are also subject to potential errors. The most significant source of uncertainty in these calculations relates to the time period over which DIC uptake is normalized. In our analysis, we assumed that DIC deficits began to accumulate following the initiation of the spring phytoplankton blooms (as judged by satellite-based chlorophyll measurements; Figure S3 ). This approach does not account for potential productivity under sea ice , which is not visible by remote sensing. Although our approach is, by necessity, somewhat simplistic, we are encouraged by the good correspondence of DIC and \u0394O 2 /Ar-derived estimates of surface water productivity. Our results suggest that mixed layer \u0394O 2 /Ar measurements have the capacity to provide meaningful NCP estimates with high spatial resolution.\nBeyond the absolute value of our derived NCP estimates, the spatial distribution of biological productivity across our survey region is of interest. Since macronutrients were plentiful across our entire survey region (minimum NO 3 \u00c0 > 8 \u03bcM), light and/or iron availability are the most likely bottom-up controls on phytoplankton productivity. Although no iron data are available for our cruise, we assume, based on previous studies, that Fe availability was highest in regions of sea ice melt along the continental shelf [Gerringa et al., 2012; Klunder et al., 2011] , where high NCP was observed. To examine the influence of light availability on surface water productivity, we derived NCP estimates for the regions surrounding each of our hydrographic stations (within 5 km) and correlated these values to the mixed layer depths obtained from CTD data. As shown in Figure 9 , we observed a weak negative trend between NCP and MLD, particularly for stations with mixed layer depths less than 40 m. Taking only stations with MLD < 40 m, the correlation between MLD and NCP was statistically significant (for 1 m binned data, r = \u00c00.86, p < 0.001).

The pCO 2 measurements were calibrated using temperature-controlled seawater standards [Tortell et al., 2011] , and the resulting pCO 2 data were corrected to in situ SST following [Takahashi et al., 2002] . Note that pCO 2 data are not available for much of the N-S transect due to instrument problems. O 2 /Ar measurements in the flow-through seawater, (O 2 /Ar) meas , were normalized to values measured every few hours in airequilibrated, temperature-controlled seawater standards, (O 2 /Ar) sat. [Tortell et al., 2011] , to derive a biological O 2 saturation term, \u0394O 2 /Ar, expressed in % deviation from equilibrium.\nThis term was calculated as [Craig and Hayward, 1987 ]\nSurface O 2 concentration measurements were made using an optode (Aanderaa Data Instruments, model 3830), while total gas pressure (mbar) was measured using a gas tension device (Pro-Oceanus, model HGTD). The gas tension device was not functional during the latter half of the cruise. Both the optode and HGTD were submerged in a thermally insulated flow-through box connected to the keel seawater intake supply and set to acquire data with a 1 min resolution (close to the response time of the HGTD). \nThe rationale for this approach is that optode-based \u0394O 2 is sensitive to both physical and biological influences, whereas MIMS-based \u0394O 2 /Ar reflects only the biological contribution to O 2 disequilibria [Craig and Hayward, 1987] , after normalizing for physical effects using the biologically inert analog, argon. As calculated here (2), \u0394O 2phys is thus functionally equivalent to the physically induced changes in Argon saturation, \u0394Ar.\nFollowing the approach of McNeil et al. [2005, 1995] , we derived estimates of N 2 partial pressure from GTD total gas pressure by subtracting the partial pressures of O 2 (derived from optode measurements), water vapor (calculated from SST and SSS), and Ar.\nIn previous studies, seawater Ar concentrations have been assumed to be at atmospheric equilibrium values. This assumption contributes only a small uncertainty (<0.1%) to the calculation of N 2 concentrations [McNeil et al., 1995] , since Ar is a minor constituent of total partial pressure and varies by only a few percent. Indeed, we observed a negligible difference between pN 2 calculated assuming 100% Ar saturation and calculations that included a specific \u0394Ar term (derived from \u0394O 2phys ). Similarly, the inclusion of pCO 2 into the calculation did not have a significant effect on the resulting pN 2 . The N 2 saturation state (\u0394N 2 ) was calculated from GTD-derived N 2 concentrations and observed atmospheric pressure using the SST and salinity-dependent N 2 solubility constant of Hamme and Emerson [2004] .\n10.1002/2014GB004975 Vagle et al., 2010] , including recent observations from the Sub-Antarctic zone of the Southern Ocean [Weeding and Trull, 2014] , where \u0394N 2 did not exceed~+3% during an observation period of 7 months. Our observations may be indicative of a persistently high \u0394N 2 signal across large areas of the Southern Ocean, driven by high regional wind speeds and strong changes in atmospheric pressure.\nBox model calculations of \u0394N 2 , based on gas exchange processes and mixed layer entrainment [Nicholson et al., 2011] , were used to examine the various processes contributing to the high \u0394N 2 across our survey region. In general, the calculated \u0394N 2 values were in good agreement with our observations, and the model was able to reproduce both the absolute magnitude of \u0394N 2 and its spatial variability along much of our cruise track (Figure 6a) . In a number of instances, however, modeled \u0394N 2 was significantly lower than the observed values, particularly at the beginning and end of the HGTD data record. While it is possible that offsets between observations and model output at the end of the data reflect problems with the HGTD before its failure, several sources of uncertainty are also present in our calculations. The 1-D model we used for our calculations does not account for advection of water masses with possibly different preformed gas concentrations. The dynamic system of frontal zones between Cape Town and the Polar Front may thus explain part of the discrepancy between observations and model output during the northern portion of the N-S transect. The remainder of our survey region is less prone to advection, owing to a (zonally) more homogeneous water mass structure. In the MIZ, uncertainty in the model calculations may result from sea ice-dependent processes. The sea ice history used in the model was derived from reprocessed satellite data with a relatively coarse spatial resolution. Sea ice cover exerts a significant influence on the strength of air-sea exchange, and errors in the representation of sea ice cover or in the parameterization of ice effects on gas exchange coefficients [Loose et al., 2009] would lead to uncertainty in the \u0394N 2 calculation. Notwithstanding these sources of uncertainty, we conclude that our observations provide a reasonable validation of the Nicholson et al. [2011] model in various Southern Ocean regions with high wind speeds and strong temporal changes in atmospheric pressure. Additional GTD data and Figure 6a shows the \u0394N 2 value derived from Gas Tension Device (GTD) measurements, while the red line shows the results of box model calculations (see text for a full description).

For these calculations, we used the average O 2 concentration 20-25 m below the mixed layer depth to define the end-member concentration (c O2 ;sub ) for entrained waters. This depth was chosen based on examination of mixed layer depth history from the PSY3V3 output during a number of modeled entrainment events. The mean c O2 ;sub end-member values were calculated from CTD data for each sampling station and interpolated to the full resolution of our cruise track for use in the entrainment calculations.\nThe model mixed layer concentrations of O 2 and N 2 were initialized at 100% saturation starting 30 days prior to the underway measurements.

The intensity of this mixing is particularly strong in the polar frontal region, where we observed the greatest enhancement of surface Chl a fluorescence. Relative to the N-S transect, waters of the Weddell Sea MIZ and near-shore regions of the WAP showed extreme variability in Chl a fluorescence. Values ranged by more than 2 orders of magnitude and exhibited sharp gradients over small spatial scales, often in regions of local sea ice melt (Figure 3c ). Previous studies have demonstrated a strong influence of sea ice processes on phytoplankton growth in surface waters [Arrigo and van Dijken, 2004; Smith and Nelson, 1985] . Melting ice can stimulate phytoplankton growth through the release of Fe [Gerringa et al., 2012; Sedwick and DiTullio, 1997] and/or decreasing surface salinity, which acts to stabilize the mixed layer. Indeed, we observed a negative relationship between Chl a fluorescence and salinity in the WAP (r = \u00c00.42) and, to a lesser extent, along the E-W transit (r = \u00c00.17). The relationship between biological productivity and mixed layer depth is addressed in section 3.6.\nIn Figure 5 , we have plotted our cruise track over the gridded CO 2 fluxes of Takahashi et al. [2009] . Our sampling region encompassed~25 grid cells (seven of which lacked primary data), and we derived mean CO 2 fluxes and air-sea CO 2 gradients (\u0394CO 2 ) for these areas. The results, shown in Table 1 , highlight a significant difference between the CO 2 fluxes derived from our MIMS data, and those from the climatology.

The largest discrepancies between the model and observations occurred along the N-S transect, and in the WAP region. As discussed above for \u0394N 2 , the discrepancy between modeled and observed \u0394O 2 along the N-S transect may have resulted from the lateral advection of heterogeneous water masses. By comparison, the high apparent values of \u0394O 2phys measured in the WAP (in excess of +10%) are more difficult to reconcile with known physical processes driving O 2 supersaturation in the mixed layer. Given the extremely high O 2 concentrations in this region (>60% O 2 supersaturation), the optode was measuring at the outer limit of its calibration range, and we cannot exclude measurement errors leading to an overestimation of \u0394O 2phys . Moreover, the shallow mixed layers and bottom depths in the coastal WAP make this region susceptible to physically induced O 2 supersaturation resulting from bubble injection under high wind speeds. Under these conditions, our calculations, which assume 100% O 2 saturation in subsurface waters, would underestimate \u0394O 2pe .\nIn addition to our calculations of \u0394O 2pe , we used the box model to derive an O 2 entrainment term associated with the transport of biologically modified waters into the mixed layer. This entrainment term, \u0394O 2be , can be used to correct \u0394O 2 /Ar-derived NCP estimates, neglecting the contribution of purely physical entrainment processes (\u0394O 2pe ) that have no significant effect on \u0394O 2 /Ar. The distribution of modeled \u0394O 2be along the cruise track is shown in Figure 7b , along with our \u0394O 2 /Ar observations. For much of our survey region, the magnitude of the biologically modified entrainment flux was small compared to the mixed layer \u0394O 2 /Ar signal. There were, however, a number of areas (particularly along the N-S transect), where the two O 2 fluxes were similar in magnitude. The variability in modeled \u0394O 2be results from differences in O 2 depth profiles and mixed layer depth history along the cruise track. Under conditions where subsurface O 2 is lower than mixed layer values, due to net heterotrophy in the subeuphotic zone, entrainment of biologically modified subsurface waters acts to decrease the O 2 saturation in the mixed layer (i.e., \u0394O 2be < 0). This phenomenon was clearly observed in the ice-covered waters of the N-S and E-W transects (Figure 7b ), where \u0394O 2be showed a clear negative signature. In contrast, we observed a number of regions, mostly in the WAP, where \u0394O 2be was positive, reflecting the entrainment of a remnant productivity signal prior to mixed layer shoaling. Jonsson et al. [2013] have also noted the importance of entrainment as a potential source of O 2 into the mixed layer. Quantification of this O 2 source depends on an understanding of mixed layer depth history and the choice of an appropriate subsurface O 2 end-member (c O2 ;sub ). Based on an analysis of the mixed layer time series produced by the PSY3V3 model output, we chose a subsurface O 2 end-member ( c O2 ;sub ) 20-25 m below the mixed layer. We note, however, that these endmember O 2 values and the corresponding mixed layer histories are subject to potentially significant uncertainty. Nonetheless, as discussed below, we found that the derived \u0394O 2be term was able to produce entrainment-corrected \u0394O 2 /Ar-NCP values that showed good agreement with independent estimates based on DIC deficit calculations. It is also important to note that the entrainment term was generally small compared to the biological O 2 production signal (i.e., \u0394O 2 /Ar) in the mixed layer for much of our survey region.\nrelationship provides some evidence for light-dependent productivity, as suggested previously Cassar et al.\n[2011], Huang et al. [2012] , and Shadwick et al. [2014] . We note, however, that instantaneous MLD estimates do not necessarily provide a good indication of light availability over time scales relevant to our NCP calculations. A more refined analysis could be used, taking into account the time-dependent history of MLD, surface irradiance, and water column light extinction (based on Chl a concentrations). Even without this added complexity, our derived NCP estimates likely reflect the dominant influence of light, nutrient supply, and sea ice cover on biological productivity across strongly distinct regions of the Southern Ocean."}, {"section_title": "CO 2 Flux Calculations", "text": "Surface gas measurements and wind speed data were used to derive sea-air flux estimates for CO 2 .

[2007] to estimate net community production (NCP, i.e., gross photosynthesis minus community respiration) from our mixed layer \u0394O 2 /Ar measurements. The calculations presented by Reuer et al. [2007] are based on a steady state model, where lateral advection and vertical entrainment are assumed to be negligible, and the mixed layer O 2 mass balance is influenced solely by NCP and gas exchange. Under these conditions, steady state NCP is equivalent to the air-sea flux of biogenic O 2 (obtained from \u0394O 2 /Ar and the air equilibrium O 2 concentration, \u03b1 O2 \u00d7 p atm ). The gas exchange term, k, is derived using a weighting function to account for variability in wind speed history over the residence time of O 2 in the mixed layer (see Reuer et al. [2007] for details).\nFor consistency with our box model calculations, we used the gas exchange parameterization (k) of Sweeney et al. [2007] , and the ice-dependent scaling factor of Loose et al.\n[2009] to derived NCP estimates.\nWe recognize that the assumptions required for the \u0394O 2 /Ar-based NCP calculations are unrealistic for at least some portions of our cruise track where entrainment of subsurface waters into the mixed layer is likely nonnegligible. To examine the influence of mixed layer entrainment on NCP, we used the output from our box model calculations (see above) to estimate the O 2 flux associated with changes in mixed layer depth. Based on our calculation of \u0394O 2pe and \u0394O 2te , we derived a specific biological entrainment term, \u0394O 2be , for use in the correction of \u0394O 2 /Ar for NCP calculations.\nThis term reflects the entrainment of biologically modified O 2 signatures from subsurface waters. The purely physical entrainment term, \u0394O 2pe , affects O 2 and Ar in a nearly identical manner and thus has a negligible influence on the measured \u0394O 2 /Ar ratio. In contrast, \u0394O 2be specifically affects O 2 and thus modifies \u0394O 2 /Ar. Our approach, based on the separation of biogenic and nonbiogenic entrainment fluxes, thus allows us to correct the observed \u0394O 2 /Ar values for entrainment of biologically modified subsurface waters, after removing the nonbiological entrainment signature. We used the corrected \u0394O 2 /Ar data as input to equation (11). Given the physical complexity of our study region, and its high degree of temporal variability, we treat our NCP calculations as a first-order estimate of biological O 2 production rates in the mixed layer, recognizing the quantitative limitations of this approach.\nAdditional NCP estimates were derived from an analysis of seasonal mixed layer DIC deficits as described in section 2.5. In order to estimate a mean daily NCP rate from these seasonal deficits, it is necessary to choose an integration time scale (i.e., the length of time over which the DIC deficit has accrued). We obtained an estimate of the integration time scale using an analysis of 8 day AquaModis Chl a imagery provided by Oregon State University, with a cloud-filling algorithm (http://www.science.oregonstate.edu/ocean. productivity/). We computed mean Chl a concentrations in three geographic regions centered around the N-S, E-W, and WAP sections of our cruise track and used these values to reconstruct the history of surface Chl a concentrations in each subregion ( Figure S3 ).

Along the E-W and WAP transects, SST ranged from \u00c01.8 to 3\u00b0C and exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity (Figures 2a and 3d) . The relatively warm SST of the WAP region reflects the influence of surface warming in shallow near-shore waters, and/or the signature of modified circumpolar deep water flowing onto the continental shelf [Martinson and McKee, 2012] . Salinity also showed significant spatial variability across the E-W and WAP regions.

In sections 3.5 and 3.6, we discuss the relative contributions of physical and biological processes to O 2 supersaturation. Here we note only that \u0394O 2 /Ar was positively correlated with Chl a (r = 0.66 and 0.43 along the E-W and WAP transects, respectively) and showed enhancements in frontal zones along the N-S transect. Unlike \u0394O 2 /Ar, pCO 2 is sensitive to temperature-dependent solubility changes. During the 30 days prior to our sampling, the NOAA OISST data show an average surface water warming of 1\u00b0C along our cruise track. This warming would lead to a 4% (~15 \u03bcatm) increase in pCO 2 [Takahashi et al., 2002] , which is small compared to the observed pCO 2 variability along the cruise track. This result indicates that biological uptake exhibited a first-order control on pCO 2 distributions.\nAs expected, pCO 2 exhibited a strong negative correlation with \u0394O 2 /Ar along our cruise track (Pearson's correlation coefficient, r = \u00c00.85 and \u00c00.91 for the E-W and WAP regions, respectively).

This discrepancy can be explained by the differential rate of sea-air O 2 and CO 2 exchange. Faster air-sea equilibration of O 2 results in a shorter residence time of this gas in the mixed layer, and a more rapid ventilation of photosynthetically derived O 2 .

[2009] , compiled from a global compilation of field measurements. This climatology indicates a weak to moderate Southern Ocean CO 2 sink between~40 and 50\u00b0S (between the STF and PF) and suggests that waters south of the PF are either neutral or slight sources of CO 2 to the atmosphere. However, actual data coverage is sparse over much of the high-latitude Southern Ocean, particularly in the MIZ and the continental shelf regions. Examination of the underlying pCO 2 data set used to construct the 2009 climatology shows very few summer time (December and January) pCO 2 observations in the Weddell Sea MIZ, with many grid cells lacking primary data, and fluxes derived from interpolation of the nearest available observations. Moreover, the resolution of the climatology grid cells (4\u00b0\u00d7 5\u00b0) is coarse relative to the observed length scales of variability.

This work has been largely based on the approach developed by Kaiser et al. [2005] and Reuer et al. [2007] , where the mixed layer O 2 budget is assumed to be in a steady state, with negligible vertical or lateral fluxes. Under these conditions, the biologically induced flux of O 2 to the atmosphere (O 2 bioflux, as defined by equation (11)) provides a measure of NCP. The assumptions used in these calculations are problematic in weakly stratified and highly dynamic waters encountered over large portions of the Southern Ocean. Jonsson et al. [2013] have shown that O 2 bioflux provides good regional estimates of Southern Ocean NCP (\u00b1~25%), but significant offsets can exist at smaller scales due to a temporal decoupling between O 2 production and air-sea exchange and to vertical O 2 fluxes across the base of the mixed layer. Using our box model results (section 3.5), we were able to estimate the contribution of entrainment fluxes to the surface biological O 2 budget, and we used this information to correct NCP estimates derived from surface \u0394O 2 /Ar data. However, our calculations do not include other physical processes such as upwelling and diapycnal mixing that can also influence NCP derived from \u0394O 2 /Ar measurements [Jonsson et al., 2013] . ). Despite the low overall productivity observed along much of this transect, there were localized regions of elevated NCP associated with regional frontal features-most notably in the vicinity of the Polar Front zone where vertical mixing can supply Fe to iron-limited surface waters [Debaar et al., 1995] . Without a correction for entrainment, waters of the Weddell Sea MIZ (both along the N-S and E-W transects) appeared to be net heterotrophic (i.e., NCP < 0). However, this apparent net heterotrophic signature was eliminated after accounting for the entrainment fluxes (\u0394O 2be ). In contrast, the entrainment-corrected NCP remained below zero in the STF zone, and in several other localized regions along the cruise track. Net heterotrophy in the STF zone seems unlikely, given the enhanced Chl a concentrations in this region (Figure 3c ). Rather, we suggest that an overestimation of the O 2 entrainment term (\u0394O 2be ), resulting from errors in the selection of a sub-MLD end-member or in the derived mixed layer depth history, is a more likely explanation for this feature. Regions of net heterotrophy observed along other portions of our cruise track (e.g., between 8000 and 9000 km) were largely confined to waters with very low (<0.3 \u03bcg L \u00c01 ) Chl a concentrations.

To the extent that our results are applicable on a broad regional scale, there may thus be a need to critically reevaluate current estimates of Southern Ocean CO 2 uptake.\nThe increasing availability of autonomous shipboard instruments for surface gas measurements (e.g., optodes, GTDs, and seagoing mass spectrometers) has significantly expanded the spatial and temporal coverage of oceanic dissolved gas observations. In the future, continued deployments of these autonomous instruments, along with instrumented floats, gliders, and moorings Nicholson et al., 2008] , will allow us to assemble a more robust database of Southern Ocean \u0394N 2, \u0394O 2 , \u0394O 2 /Ar to help constrain NCP and airsea exchange processes. Moreover, additional pCO 2 measurements in poorly sampled regions will help to refine mean climatological CO 2 fluxes for the Southern Ocean. In conjunction with increased data coverage, more sophisticated modeling approaches could be used to interpret surface gas distributions, taking into account smaller-scale physical processes that act to perturb the mixed layer mass balance. Improved data sets and models will facilitate more robust NCP and CO 2 flux estimates and increase our understanding of the Southern Ocean's role in global biogeochemical cycles."}]
