To assess potential neuroimaging biomarkers, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative is following normal controls (NC) and individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD. We applied high-throughput image analyses procedures to these data to demonstrate the feasibility of detecting subtle structural changes in prodromal AD. Raw DICOM scans (139 NC, 175 MCI, and 84 AD) were downloaded for analysis. Volumetric segmentation and cortical surface reconstruction produced continuous cortical surface maps and region-of-interest (ROI) measures. The MCI cohort was subdivided into single-(SMCI) and multiple-domain MCI (MMCI) based on neuropsychological performance. Repeated measures analyses of covariance were used to examine group and hemispheric effects while controlling for age, sex, and, for volumetric measures, intracranial vault. ROI analyses showed group differences for ventricular, temporal, posterior and rostral anterior cingulate, posterior parietal, and frontal regions. SMCI and NC differed within temporal, rostral posterior cingulate, inferior parietal, precuneus, and caudal midfrontal regions. With MMCI and AD, greater differences were evident in these regions and additional frontal and retrosplenial cortices; evidence for non-AD pathology in MMCI also was suggested. Mesial temporal right-dominant asymmetries were evident and did not interact with diagnosis. Our findings demonstrate that high-throughput methods provide numerous measures to detect subtle effects of prodromal AD, suggesting early and later stages of the preclinical state in this cross-sectional sample. These methods will enable a more complete longitudinal characterization and allow us to identify changes that are predictive of conversion to AD. Hum Brain Mapp 00:000-000, 2009.

Neuroimaging measures hold promise for guiding treatment before the occurrence of significant functional impairment or irreversible neuronal damage [Mueller et al., 2005; Scheltens et al., 2002; Thal et al., 2006] , and such measures may facilitate the identification of individuals at greater risk for developing AD, improve the discrimination of AD from other types of dementia, and provide greater statistical power in clinical trials, allowing for smaller sample sizes [Jack et al., 2003 Thal et al., 2006] . They may also allow for shorter treatment trials by identifying individuals with high likelihood of imminent conversion.\nThe need for neuroimaging biomarkers is the motivation behind the multisite Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), aimed at facilitating the scientific evaluation of neuroimaging and other biomarkers in the onset and progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD [Mueller et al., 2005] . MCI participants are impaired on one or more standardized tests of cognitive function, with memory as one of the impaired domains; they demonstrate no associated functional impairment and do not meet criteria for clinical diagnosis of dementia [Petersen, 2004] . Such individuals are at increased risk of converting to AD, estimated at 10-15% per year, compared with 1-2% per year for cognitively intact elderly [Petersen, 2004] , and neuropathological studies support the notion that amnestic MCI may be a transitional state between healthy aging and AD [Markesbery et al., 2006; Morris et al., 2001; Petersen et al., 2006] . Individuals with single-domain, amnestic MCI (SMCI) may reflect the earliest stage of prodromal AD, whereas those with multidomain MCI (MMCI) may represent a later disease state. MCI is, however, a heterogeneous disorder; some individuals remain stable, others convert to another type of dementia, and still others revert to normal cognitive status [Boyle et al., 2006; Jicha et al., 2006; Petersen et al., 2006] . Methods to facilitate the prediction of which MCI individuals are likely to convert to AD would aid clinical trials by allowing them to focus on those at most risk of imminent conversion.\nStructural MRI may prove useful in assessing the prognosis of individuals with MCI by enabling earlier clinical diagnosis and predicting disease progression. Previous studies of AD have examined regions affected early in the neurodegenerative process, including mesial temporal and temporoparietal association areas, and have shown that early atrophy in these regions is followed by more extensive involvement of frontal and parietal regions, leaving primary and secondary sensory areas relatively spared until late in the disease [Atiya et al., 2003; Braak and Braak, 1991; Braak et al., 2006; Smith, 2002; Thompson et al., 2003 Thompson et al., , 2007 . Consequently, studies in early AD and in those at risk for AD, such as individuals with MCI, have focused primarily on mesial temporal regions, demonstrating that hippocampal and entorhinal cortex typically are smaller than those measured in controls [Atiya et al., 2003; Bell-McGinty et al., 2005; Bobinski et al., 1999; Convit et al., 1997; Du et al., 2001; Jack et al., 1997; Juottonen et al., 1998 Juottonen et al., , 1999 Killiany et al., 2002; Singh et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2000] and predictive of future conversion to AD den Heijer et al., 2006; deToledo-Morrell et al., 2004; Jack et al., 1999 Jack et al., , 2005 Killiany et al., 1993 Killiany et al., , 2002 Stoub et al., 2005] . The definitive classification and specificity of these changes to AD, particularly for the hippocampus, remain a challenge [van de Pol et al., 2006] , thus, ongoing work continues to examine additional regions and patterns of regional changes [Hua et al., 2008; Karas et al., 2004; Seo et al., 2007; Singh et al., 2006; Thompson et al., 2007; Whitwell et al., 2008] . The cingulate cortex, for example, has been shown to exhibit changes in at-risk individuals [Hirao et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2006] and in those known to eventually convert to AD [Killiany et al., 2000] , and recent work suggests that MMCI individuals may evidence thinner precuneus cortices relative to SMCI [Seo et al., 2007] . The ADNI provides a rich resource of relevant data for normal elderly controls (NC) and individuals with MCI or early AD [Mueller et al., 2005] to determine the regional atrophy pattern associated with early stages of the disease. Such patterns may prove useful in predicting disease progression and in distinguishing AD from other neurodegenerative disorders.\nTo be of practical value in clinical trials or medical treatment, quantification of regional atrophy must be efficient and accurate, resilient in the face of variable brain morphology, and robust to differences in scanner platforms. Ongoing development within the NIH/NCRR sponsored Morphometry Biomedical Informatics Research Network (mBIRN) and the ADNI have resulted in procedures for image acquisition, automated corrections, and image analysis methods that enable large, multisite clinical research studies. In this study, we employed volumetric segmentation [Fischl et al., , 2004a and cortical surface reconstruction and parcellation [Dale et al., 1999; Dale and Sereno, 1993; Fischl et al., 1999a Fischl et al., , 2004b techniques for each individual's brain, combining the advantages of regions-of-interest (ROI) approaches that allow examination of disease effects in specific regions with the advantages of voxel-based approaches, which allow greater exploitation of information obtained from all brain areas.\nThis study examined the pattern of neurodegeneration associated with SMCI, MMCI, and AD and the feasibility of applying these methods to a large subset of the ADNI baseline cohort to successfully combine data across multiple scanner platforms. The findings will reveal whether these methods are robust in the face of extensive neuroanatomical variability observed in AD, are sensitive enough to reveal the subtle characterization of SMCI, and are able to reveal signs of progressive impairment in early versus later stages of prodromal AD in this cross-sectional sample."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "Raw MRI, basic demographic data, and clinical neuropsychological data were downloaded from the publicly available ADNI database (www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI); all image processing and analyses were performed locally in the Multi-modal Imaging Laboratory at UCSD."}, {"section_title": "Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (www.loni.ucla.edu/ ADNI). The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year public-private partnership. ADNI's goal is to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials.\nThe Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, M.D., VA Medical Center and University of California-San Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many coinvestigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations. Subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada. ADNI's goal was to recruit 800 adults, ages 55-90, to participate in the research-200 cognitively normal individuals to be followed for 3 years, 400 people with MCI to be followed for 3 years, and 200 people with early AD to be followed for 2 years (see www.adni-info.org)."}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "ADNI eligibility criteria are described at http://www. adni-info.org/index.php?option5com_content&task5view&id5 9&Itemid543. Briefly, subjects are 55-90 years of age, had an informant able to provide an independent evaluation of functioning, and spoke either English or Spanish. All subjects were willing and able to undergo all test procedures including neuroimaging and agreed to longitudinal followup. Specific psychoactive medications are excluded. General inclusion/exclusion criteria are as follows:\n1. Normal subjects: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [Folstein et al., 1975] The cohort in this study is described in Table I . The groups were not significantly different on age (F < 1.0, P > 0.05) but did differ in years of education (F 5 3.0, P < 0.01). The AD group had significantly fewer years of education relative to the NC (P < 0.005), SMCI (P < 0.005), and MMCI (P < 0.05) groups; NC, SMCI, and MMCI groups did not significantly differ from each other (t's < 1, p's > 0.05). Sex distribution across the groups differed significantly (v 2 5 9.3, P < 0.05); the MMCI group had significantly fewer females relative to all other groups. All groups were significantly different in terms of MMSE and CDR (all P < 0.001), except that SMCI and MMCI groups did not differ on CDR status, as expected based on diagnostic status."}, {"section_title": "Procedures", "text": "Raw DICOM MRI scans (including two T1-weighted volumes per case) were downloaded from the public ADNI site (http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/Data/index.shtml); these data were collected across a variety of scanners with protocols individualized for each scanner, as defined at http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/Research/Cores/index. shtml. The MRI protocols for the relevant manufacturer platforms were optimized within the ADNI study to maximize the scientific utility of the data and to ensure use of equivalent pulse sequences In our laboratory, these data were reviewed for quality, automatically corrected for spatial distortion because of gradient nonlinearity [Jovicich et al., 2006] and B1 field inhomogeneity [Sled et al., 1998 ], registered, and averaged to improve signal-to-noise. The reduction of site-specific distortion effects and normalization of inhomogeneities significantly improves the accuracy of morphometric analysis and permits detection of subtle changes [Jovicich et al., 2006] . Local quality control measures excluded 15 cases (3.6% of available baseline cases at that time) because of extreme white matter disease or atrophy (e.g., one case with extensive left temporal lobe loss such that the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle subsumed a large extent of the anterior temporal lobe); these cases are not included in Table I .\nUsing volumetric segmentation [Fischl et al., , 2004a and cortical surface reconstruction [Dale and Sereno, 1993; Dale et al., 1999; Fischl et al., 1999a Fischl et al., , 2004b methods based on the publicly available FreeSurfer software package, volumetric measures were created for hippocampus, amygdala, caudate, putamen, nucleus accumbens, thalamus, ventricles, and white matter (Fig. 1) . The automated, fully 3D whole-brain segmentation procedure [Fischl et al., , 2004a ] uses a probabilistic atlas and applies a Bayesian classification rule to assign a neuroanatomical label to each voxel. The probability of a class at each point is computed as the probability that the given class appeared at that location in the training set, modulated by the probability of the surrounding configuration of labels in the six cardinal directions, times the likelihood of obtaining the subject-specific measured intensity value from that class. The atlas consists of a manually derived training set created by the Center for Morphometric Analysis (http://www.cma.mgh.harvard.edu/) from 40 non-ADNI subjects across the age range, including individuals with AD. This process required only qualitative review to ensure no technical failure of the application. The accuracy of this automated procedure has been shown to be comparable to that of manual labeling and sensitive to subtle brain changes in AD and normal aging [Fischl et al., , 2004a . In addition, estimated total cranial vault (eTIV) volume was calculated to control for differences in head size for volumetric measures [Buckner et al., 2004] .\nThe cortical surface was reconstructed to measure thickness at each surface location, or vertex, using a semiautomated approach with submillimeter accuracy [Dale and Sereno, 1993; Dale et al., 1999; Fischl and Dale, 2000; Fischl et al., 1999a] . Continuous, high-resolution maps then allow visualization of average group thickness or differences between groups at each vertex (as in Figs. 2 and 3 ). The explicit reconstruction of the cortical surface is a complex procedure, including correction of intensity variations because of magnetic field inhomogeneities, creation of a normalized intensity image, and removal of the skull (nonbrain) [Dale and Sereno, 1993; Dale et al., 1999; Fischl and Dale, 2000; Fischl et al., 1999a] . The resulting surface is covered with a polygonal tessellation and smoothed to reduce metric distortions. A refinement procedure is applied to obtain a representation of the gray/white boundary, and this surface is subsequently deformed outward to obtain an explicit representation of the pial surface. Once generated, the cortical surface model is manually reviewed and edited for technical accuracy. Minimal manual editing was performed in alignment with standard, objective editing rules. Each individual surface is nonrigidly aligned to an atlas in a spherical surface-based coordinate system [Fischl et al., 1999b] for continuous surface maps of average group thickness and group differences in average thickness, as well as for the application of the parcellation scheme described later. Studies demonstrate a high correlation of automatic and manual measures in vivo and ex vivo [Fischl and Dale, 2000; Fischl et al., 2002; Rosas et al., 2002] .\nThe surface was then divided into distinct cortical ROIs [Fischl et al., 2004b] . In the spherical coordinate system, each surface location, or vertex, is assigned a neuroanatomical label based on (1) the probability of each label at each location in a surface-based atlas space, based on a manually parcellated training set; (2) local curvature information; and (3) contextual information, encoding spatial neighborhood relationships between labels. The resultant ROIs are then available within the subject-specific native space. The parcellation scheme [Desikan et al., 2006 ] labels cortical sulci and gyri, and thickness values are calculated in the numerous ROIs produced by this parcellation (Figs. 4 and 5). The labels for two cingulate regions were renamed within this study: the posterior and isthmus cingulate as defined in the original parcellation scheme [Desikan et al., 2006] are referred to here as the rostralposterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortex, respectively. Thus, cortical thickness was averaged within numerous ROIs as well as estimated over continuous, high-resolution maps.\nFreeSurfer image processing employed version 3.0.2 and used 24-h computational time for image construction, using a dual quad core Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5420 with a processing speed of 2.50 GHz and16 GB ram. Use of several CPUs allowed processing of multiple subjects' scans to occur in parallel. Manual editing included correction of r Structural MRI Biomarkers for AD r r 5 r skull-stripping errors (e.g., removal of meninges), correction of the grey/white boundary to avoid inclusion of white matter lesions (appearing as hypointensities in the T1-weighed images) in thickness measurements, and other corrections routinely employed in FreeSurfer-based analyses; the implementation of these rules was overseen by an expert neuroanatomist (CFN). Qualitative review and editing described earlier required 45 min per subject."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "Results include continuous maps representing group differences in average cortical thickness and ROIs for volumetric and thickness measures. Derived values for ROIs were submitted to repeated measures analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs), with covariates of age, gender, and, for volumetric measures, estimated total intracranial vault (eTIV) volume, to examine differences across all four groups; hemisphere was employed as a within-subject factor to assess left/right asymmetry across diagnostic groups. An a of 0.001 was employed for group main effects. When a group effect was significant, subsequent pairwise contrasts were carried out, at the conventional a 5 0.05 level, to assess significance of differences between individual groups in the predicted directions. Effect sizes were calculated for all regions using Cohen's d [Cohen, 1977] , computed by dividing the mean difference between groups by the pooled standard deviation. Effect sizes and average percent differences were based on estimated marginal means resulting from the pairwise contrasts.\nPlanned comparisons characterize the extent to which temporal, posterior cingulate, and posterior parietal regions within each diagnostic group differ from the normal elderly control sample. Within each subject, principal regional measures include hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal, parahippocampal, and lateral temporal cortices (lateral inferior, middle, and superior temporal gyri); lateral, temporal horn, and third ventricles; four subdivisions of the cingulate cortex including retrosplenial (isthmus cortex), rostral posterior, caudal anterior, and rostral anterior); and precuneus, inferior, and superior parietal regions (Figs. 1 and 4) . Based on the hypothesis that SMCI and MMCI may represent progressive stages of prodromal AD, SMCI and NC groups were expected to differ for mesial temporal and posterior cingulate regions, with even greater differences expected in MMCI and AD relative to NC. MMCI and AD groups were expected to exhibit thinner lateral temporal, parietal, and anterior cingulate cortices as pathology extends to association cortices with disease progression. Occipital, basal ganglia, and cerebellar regions were not expected to differ across groups. Additional exploratory analyses were performed to examine differences in frontal cortices (rostral and caudal midfrontal; medial and lateral orbitofrontal; superior regions; para-, pre-, and postcentral cortices); midfrontal and orbitofrontal cortices in particular may reflect vulnerability to AD pathogenesis prior to clinical diagnosis.\nFinally, because significant group differences were apparent in multiple regions, even in the comparison of NC and SMCI groups, exploratory analyses were carried out to examine patterns of regional effects. Because of the unexpected findings in the MMCI group, as discussed in the Results section, we included only NC, SMCI, and AD participants in this exploration. To minimize multiple comparisons, these analyses were carried out only within left hemisphere for regions representing the expected path of AD-related changes, including: hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, rostral posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices, lateral middle temporal gyrus, inferior parietal cortex, medial orbitofrontal, and rostral midfrontal cortices. First, to suggest the hypothesized pattern of regional change that may occur with progression from NC to SMCI to AD, we examined the contribution of linear and quadratic components to a theoretical trajectory of change across these cross-sectional data. We performed an ANCOVA with group as a factor and the standard covariates described earlier. Polynomial contrasts examined the significance of linear and quadratic effects. Linear progres- sion would suggest a continuous, similar amount of atrophy between NC and SMCI as between SMCI and AD; a quadratic component would suggest a different degree of atrophy. That is, atrophy in a region with a significant negative quadratic component across groups might be accelerating with disease progression. Second, we examined group by region interactions through repeated measures ANCOVA with standard covariates; region was employed as a two-level, within-subject factor. Significant group by region interactions may suggest that cortical thinning occurs at a different rate in each region over disease progression."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Comparisons of continuous cortical thickness maps provided a comprehensive view of group differences and support a pattern of progressive atrophy from NC to SMCI to MMCI to early AD. Differences in average thickness are displayed for each group relative to the NC group (Fig. 2) ; statistical analyses were performed on the ROI measures and are described in sections that follow. The surface maps suggest that the SMCI group averages were at least 250 lm thinner in mesial temporal regions (orange/yellow) and 100-150 lm thinner in the lateral temporal gyri (dark red). The MMCI group averages were similar to SMCI in the mesial temporal regions; however, relative to the NC group, the MMCI group was 250 lm thinner in more extensive mesial and lateral temporal regions (orange/yellow), and 150 lm thinner in posterior cingulate, inferior parietal, and midfrontal regions (red). Cortical thickness of NC and AD groups differed by more than 450 lm in mesial temporal regions (yellow) and more than 200 lm in posterior cingulate and temporoparietal association areas (red/orange/yellow); midfrontal regions were also thinner by 150 lm (red). Each MCI subgroup also was compared with the AD group (Fig. 3) to support this apparent progression. As expected, the MMCI group was more similar to AD overall; that is, there were fewer differences in thickness. However, the maps demonstrated unanticipated trends toward thinner cortices in MMCI (by 100 lm or more) relative to the AD group in anterior cingulate, paracentral, and precentral regions (Fig. 3 , bottom row in blue).

There was no significant interaction for retrosplenial and inferior parietal (F(2,297) < 1.0, P > 0.05).

These methods were robust in the face of extensive neuroanatomical variability observed in AD, revealed the expected characterization of AD, and detected subtle effects in SMCI and MMCI that may represent prodromal AD. ROI findings confirm and extend previous work in AD, demonstrating smaller white matter volumes, increased ventricular volumes and abnormal signal in the white matter, smaller hippocampal and amygdala volumes, and thinner temporal, parietal, cingulate, and frontal cortices compared with NC [e.g. Atiya et al., 2003; Singh et al., 2006; Thompson et al., 2003] . Although significant mesial temporal atrophy characterized all groups investigated here, including SMCI, MMCI, and AD, loss was widespread and evident across the cortex even within the SMCI group. This comprehensive investigation suggests a theoretical trajectory of disease progression as measured in vivo that supports neuropathological findings and demonstrates potential evidence of non-AD pathology in the MMCI group. The resultant pattern of AD-related neurodegeneration may be useful to assess the prediction of conversion to AD.\nThe investigation of SMCI and MMCI groups in this cross-sectional design provides insight into a hypothesized trajectory of disease progression. SMCI individuals may represent the earliest clinically detectable stage of AD, and there is great interest in identifying regions that are most sensitive to these early changes. In this large sample, significant differences were found between NC and SMCI within temporal regions, rostral posterior cingulate, inferior parietal, precuneus, and caudal midfrontal cortices. The examination of effect sizes suggests that the critical regions distinguishing NC and SMCI lie in the mesial temporal regions as expected, including bilateral hippocampus, bilateral entorhinal cortex, and left amygdala, as supported by recent work [Hua et al., 2008; Seo et al., 2007; Singh et al., 2006; Whitwell et al., 2008] , suggesting that these regions may be the most sensitive to early ADrelated changes. However, the finding that significant atrophy extends beyond these regions into posterior cingulate, parietal, and frontal regions shows that significant and widespread damage occurs before standard clinical measures can detect AD. The pattern of thinning in SMCI overlaps to some extent with recent findings [Seo et al., 2007] , although this larger sample demonstrated greater thinning in medial parietal, lateral middle temporal, and anterior cingulate regions and powered significant differences from NC in numerous ROIs. The finding that damage is detectable outside the mesial temporal area even at the earliest stage also may prove useful in defining a pattern of degeneration that will enable discrimination of early-stage AD from other disorders that also impact mesial temporal regions.\nAlthough the pattern of results broadly supports the view that MMCI may be a later stage of prodromal AD than SMCI, some of the structural changes observed here support that this group includes individuals with non-AD pathology. Relative to SMCI, the presumably later stage of MMCI showed greater atrophy in the inferior and lateral temporal lobe, and significantly thinner temporoparietal association cortices, retrosplenial, anterior cingulate, and other frontal regions; these findings were more widespread relative to previous work [Seo et al., 2007] , perhaps because of a larger, more heterogeneous MMCI sample. The AD and MMCI groups were relatively similar, with greater differences in some parietal, retrosplenial, and frontal regions. However, unexpectedly, the MMCI group tended to demonstrate thinner cortices in anterior cingulate and paracentral regions, while these regions were relatively spared in MCI and AD within this sample as well as in previous neuroimaging and neuropathological studies [Atiya et al., 2003; Braak and Braak, 1991; Braak et al., 2006; Smith, 2002; Thompson et al., 2003 Thompson et al., , 2007 . Although this finding requires replication to ensure that it is neither spurious nor because of methodological error, such trends may be driven by the inclusion of individuals in the MMCI cohort with impairment resulting from as yet unknown etiologies [Meyer et al., 2005; Winblad et al., 2004] , such as frontotemporal dementia, often characterized by more anterior than posterior cortical loss, including anterior cingulate deficits [Boccardi et al., 2005] . The observed effect on motor regions may be related to other disorders such as Lewy body disease, often difficult to discern early in the stages of AD [Ballmaier and Memo, 2005; Ballmaier et al., 2004; McKeith et al., 2005] . Investigation of the neuropsychological profiles, to examine motor and executive function performance, and additional PET neuroimaging data are underway within the MMCI cohort.\nWe further explored the potential progression from NC to SMCI to AD, given the unexpected findings with the MMCI cohort. These explorations suggest a theoretical trajectory of change that may occur with disease progression, and propose a pattern of regional change to be examined in subsequent within-subject, longitudinal investigations. As expected, the earliest and most dramatic effects across groups lie within the entorhinal cortex. Subsequently, rostral posterior cingulate is reduced similarly across groups. Other temporal and parietal regions, although thinner in SMCI, appear to be affected later to a greater extent, while thinning accelerates in the retrosplenial and numerous frontal regions. Considering some of these later changing regions, the lateral middle temporal gyrus may change most rapidly, followed by the posterior cingulate and inferior parietal cortices, and then the rostral middle frontal region. One proposed sequence of change, then, supports previous neuropathological findings as degeneration begins in the entorhinal cortex, moves through rostral posterior cingulate and medial orbitofrontal cortices, followed by lateral temporal, retrosplenial, and inferior parietal regions, and, subsequently, mid frontal cortex.\nFinally, building on findings in AD both cross-sectional and longitudinal [e.g. Karas et al., 2003 Thompson, 2003 , recent work in MCI has suggested that left hemisphere regions may be more affected than the right [Seo et al., 2007] , although there are conflicting reports across studies [Karas et al., 2004] . Our ROI-based exploration of hemispheric asymmetry supported strong right dominant asymmetries in the hippocampal and entorhinal cortices alongside left dominant asymmetries of the body of the lateral ventricle and the amount of white matter abnormalities; these asymmetries did not interact with diagnostic group. The mesial temporal asymmetries fit with previous findings of asymmetry in NC [e.g., Fennema-Notestine et al., 2007; Pedraza et al., 2004] , while the ventricular and white matter asymmetries may be novel. Only the lateral measure of the inferior temporal gyrus demonstrated a significant group by hemisphere interaction, suggesting a right dominant asymmetry with increasing degeneration. These findings suggest that normal asymmetries in mesial temporal areas may not be affected by disease state, whereas lateral inferior temporal asymmetries may increase with progression. This study is potentially limited by the fact that we employed an existing probabilistic atlas that was not derived from these data. Longitudinal examination of modifications in asymmetry are critical to clarify this issue, given reports of changes in asymmetry in individuals at elevated risk for and diagnosed with AD [Barnes et al., 2005; Soininen et al., 1995] ."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "These cross-sectional findings provide direction for future studies of prodromal AD poised to determine whether changes in these regions are predictive of conversion to AD. The ADNI is following these same individuals over time and providing additional data measuring metabolism, neuropsychological performance, CSF markers, and genetics. Longitudinal morphometric analyses of these data are underway that may provide standardized predictive imaging biomarkers for AD. When combined with methods such as those described here, this will enable a more complete characterization of functional and anatomical changes associated with disease progression. The mBIRN and ADNI methods enabled sensitive quantification of widespread regional atrophy within individuals and across imaging platforms, providing the basis for the potential use of MRI biomarkers in large-scale clinical trials."}]
