[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The aim of the study is to synthesize empirical research on the influence of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education on the attitude of middle school students. After screening some articles, research report, and dissertations, there are 15 (fifteen) articles that meet the established requirements. The result of the meta-analysis revealed that there was an influence between STEM education and the positive attitude of middle school students to the STEM fields. Based on the results of the research could be recommended that the need for research looking for relationship between STEM education to the scientific attitude or learners."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Achieving success in the 21 st century learning requires learning and innovation skills that include: (1) critical thinking and problem, (2) communication and collaboration, and (3) creativity and innovation (Baran, Bilici, Mesutoglu, & Ocak (2016 ), Firman, (2016 ). Furthermore skills that have to be mastered in the 21 st century learning is expertise in technology (Ritz and Fan, 2015) . Learning using Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics integrated approach can help the success of 21 st century learning skills achievement. One of the characteristics of STEM-based education is integrating Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics in problem solving found in real life (J. R. Young, N. Ortiz, and J. L. Young, 2016) . The principles of STEM education help to improve creativity and problem solving (Becker & Park (2011) , Ministry of Education and Culture (2014)). The previous research findings reveal that STEM education affects academic success, creative thinking skills, scientific attitudes, and science process skills (Becker & Park (2011) , Ministry of Education and Culture (2014)). Meta-analysis that reveal the influence of STEM education on academic achievement, creativity, and science process skills has been done (Becker & Park (2011 ), Larson & Miller, (2011 , M. S. Corlu, R. M. Capraro, & M. M. Capraro, (2014) ). Furthermore, it is necessary to reveal any scientific attitude influenced by STEM education.\nSTEM education is implemented in various countries for various reasons, namely the development of science increases, the development of global economy, the needs of individual education need to be well prepared, the need for innovation in all fields (Becker & Park (2011) , Ministry of Education and Culture (2014)). Another reason is the achievement of students in the fields of STEM subject is decline. It can be correlated with the low achievement of international studies of Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMMS) and the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) (Greenberg, Weissberg, O'Brien, Zins, Fredericks, Resnik, & Elias (2003) . The achievements of Indonesian learners aged 15 years (grade 8) on International studies in Science are at level 2. Students have sufficient scientific knowledge to provide possible explanations in a known context or draw conclusions based on simple inquiry. Students are able to do direct reasoning and make literal interpretations of the results of scientific inquiry or problem solving technology (Kier, Blanchard, Osborne & Albert (2013) . The achievement of Indonesian students in International studies is still low as stated that the quality of science education in Indonesia is still low when compared with other developing countries (OECD, 2014) . The low quality of science education is indicated by the low achievement of science literacy in international studies. The results of previous research reveal that there is a strong relationship between the principles of STEM education with international study achievement (Becker & Park (2011) . Further stated by Becker & Park (2011) that STEM education is one of the way to achieve success in international studies such as TIMMS and PISA, so STEM education in Indonesia needs to be developed.\nThe characteristics of STEM education are highly relevant and compatible with the 2013 curriculum. As stated in the 2013 curriculum document that one of the improvements of the mind-set developed by the 2013 curriculum is the strengthening of multi-disciplinary learning patterns and the strengthening of critical learning patterns (Rusilowati, Kurniawati, Nugroho & Widiyatmoko (2016) . Some researchers believe that STEM education encompasses a broader understanding of knowledge, skills and attitudes drawn up in collaborative ways (Duschl & Bybee (2014) . This is in line with the 2013 curriculum framework in Indonesia that develops the attitudes, knowledge, and skills of learners.\nEfforts to increase students' interest in both STEM and STEM careers are increasing internationally.\nEducational institutions recommend that the effort to attract learners in the field STEM and STEM careers starting from High School (Bybee & Mccrae (2011) . STEM education provides an opportunity for teachers to show learners how STEM's concepts, principles and techniques are used in an integrated way in the development of products, processes, and systems used in their daily lives (J. R. Young, N. Ortiz, and J. L. Young. (2016) . Therefore a meta-analysis of the influence of STEM education on scientific attitudes or positive attitudes of high school students in STEM field is needed."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "This study aims at concluding the outline of an empirical study of the effect of STEM education on the attitudes of high school students. This study is a meta-analysis study."}, {"section_title": "Problem definitions", "text": "The research questions will be answered as follows: (1 Further research data to be conducted metaanalysis is in table 2. Then the data is analysed by using 7 stages as stated in table 1. "}, {"section_title": "Result and Discussions", "text": "Research data related to the influence of STEM education on the positive attitude of learners toward STEM field is not found in research journal in Indonesia. So all the data analysed is the result of research from abroad. The research findings related to the type of research used are presented in Table 3 . Table 4 shows that almost all studies reveal an influence between STEM education on positive attitudes of learners towards the STEM field, either partially or partially. There is only 1 study which revealed no influence between STEM education and positive attitude toward STEM field. The research data related to the field of Mathematics is partially not found.\nResults of research on the influence of STEM education on scientific attitudes there is only one study that is revealing about beliefs. There needs to be further research that reveals the influence of STEM education on other components of scientific attitudes. The attitude dimension to the IPA in accordance with PISA is given in Table 5 below. "}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This study has conducted a metaanalysis based on the data needed to be used as a guide in subsequent research. The results of the meta-analysis revealed that there is an effect of STEM education on the positive attitude of high school students in the STEM field."}]
