[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Viral respiratory infections such as influenza and measles, which can cause severe acute respiratory symptoms, have been responsible for many epidemics. In the spring of 2003, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) spread globally. 1, 2, 3 The World Health Organization (WHO) coined the acronym SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) for this SARI and subsequently named the causative coronavirus SARS-CoV. In the summer of 2012, another SARI broke out in Saudi Arabia, which was found to be caused by a new coronavirus. The WHO named this respiratory disease Middle East respiratory syndrome also known by the acronym MERS and called the causative coronavirus MERS-CoV. In the winter of 2019, another SARI outbreak occurred in Wuhan, China, which very quickly spread around the world. The culprit was identified as another novel coronavirus, which the WHO named as SARS-CoV-2 due to similarities to SARS-CoV, and the disease was called coronavirus disease 2019 . SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emergent coronavirus closely related to SARS and MERS. 4 COVID-19 is a respiratory tract infection that causes mild symptoms in the majority of cases, but can also lead to ISSN: 1740-4398 REVIEW -Coronavirus disease 2019 : latest developments in potential treatments drugsincontext.com mortality and morbidity. Current reports suggest that COVID-19 causes milder symptoms in children, including fever and cough, but co-infection has also been observed. 4, 5 However, COVID-19 is associated with severe outcomes in the older population, immunocompromised patients, and those with chronic cardiovascular or respiratory conditions. 4 At present, no pharmaceutical products have been shown to be reliable, safe, and effective for treating COVID-19. 6 In the midst of the current global pandemic, many research groups around the world are actively developing treatments against this disease to reduce morbidities and mortalities. In the long term, the goal is to develop a vaccine to prevent further infections and future outbreaks. However, an effective vaccine may take years to develop and to manufacture on a global scale. Furthermore, it is unknown if newborns and patients already recovered from Covid-19 will need to be vaccinated. It is also uncertain if such a vaccine can protect individuals from this novel coronavirus in the future. In this narrative review, we summarise the latest body of evidence and ongoing research on the development of pharmacological therapies for COVID-19. The aim is also to review the suggested pathophysiology, prophylactic treatments, and therapeutic modalities for COVID-19."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Articles were retrieved using PubMed Clinical Queries with the search term 'Coronavirus COVID-19' regardless of the date of publication.

The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections was the main treatment regimen. 9 Ribavirin, a broad-spectrum purine nucleoside analogue, was empirically used as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent. 10 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir were also used, as it was found to have weak in vitro antiviral activity on the prototype SARS-CoV. 10, 11 Other therapies included immunomodulators (e.g. corticosteroid, convalescent plasma, and pentaglobulin), interferons, and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). 9, 12 The development of vaccines was underway by the end of the epidemic, but no effective vaccine has since emerged."}, {"section_title": "MERS 2012", "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome caused by MERS-CoV may have been transmitted to humans through infected camels.

SARS-CoV is closely related to civet and bat CoVs, but it is phylogenetically divergent from other coronaviruses associated with human infections, including ISSN: 1740-4398 REVIEW -Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): latest developments in potential treatments drugsincontext.com OC43, NL63, 229E, and HKU1. 9 The full-length genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 shows that it is similar to SARS-CoV, sharing 79.6% sequence identity. 24 Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV use the same cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor, to enter into host cells. 24 The pathophysiology of COVID-19 has yet to be confirmed, but it is likely to involve inflammatory processes that can trigger a massive cytokine storm. The cytokine profile of critically ill patients revealed increased levels of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, interferon-\u03b3 inducible protein 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-\u03b1, and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1. 25 Histopathological examination of the lungs of patients with COVID-19 revealed immunopathological changes including diffuse alveolar damage, desquamation of pneumocytes, pulmonary oedema, hyaline membrane formation, and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates. 26 According to the limited number of reports of biopsy/autopsy results of patients with COVID-19, the pathological features resemble those seen in SARS and MERS virus infections. [26] [27] [28] The similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 suggest that the development of potential prophylactics and therapeutics for COVID-19 could be based on research on SARS. 3,12,19,29-,32 An important strategy would be to possibly control the viral replication using an effective antiviral agent to minimise the subsequent inflammation and tissue damage due to high viral loads. Immunomodulators could play a rescue therapy role, as pathological findings suggest that there is immunopathological damage. 9, 26 Although the SARS-CoV-2 S protein receptor-binding domain has higher affinity than the SARS-CoV S protein receptor-binding domain, development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 could still be based on research on SARS-CoV. [33] [34] [35] Therapeutics for COVID-19\nThe majority of COVID-19 patients, especially children, are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, and will likely recover by managing their own symptoms without the need for hospitalisation. 36 38 The WHO has also launched the 'Solidarity' international clinical trial, which is investigating effective treatments and is currently comparing four of the most promising treatment options: remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir, lopinavir-ritonavir plus interferon \u03b2-1a, and hydroxychloroquine. 39 Over 90 countries have joined the 'Solidarity' international clinical trial. 39 In the following discussion, we summarise the latest evidence and research progress from the literature, with focus on pharmacological therapies (Table 1) ."}, {"section_title": "Supportive treatment", "text": "Empirical antimicrobials should be started within 1 hour after the detection of sepsis based on clinical diagnosis and local epidemiology. 4 For critically ill COVID-19 patients, intensive care treatment can include oxygen therapy, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. 40 In addition to the standard management for acute respiratory distress syndrome, the literature also suggests lower intubation threshold, early prone positioning, and cautious fluid status management, considering that the incidence of myocardial dysfunction in COVID-19 patients is high. 41 Further discussion on the intensive care management of COVID-19 patients is beyond the scope of this review."}, {"section_title": "Pharmacological therapies targeting the virus", "text": "Remdesivir Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a nucleoside analogue prodrug that inhibits viral RNA polymerases, and was developed by Gilead Science in response to the Ebola outbreak in 2017. [42] [43] [44] It is considered to be one of the most promising broad-spectrum antivirals for treating COVID-19. In vitro antiviral activities of remdesivir have been demonstrated in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. 45, 46 In early April, a preliminary report describing the clinical outcomes of a cohort of 53 hospitalised COVID-19 patients who received remdesivir, 68% of patients showed improvement of their oxygen-support status, but 60% of patients reported adverse events during follow-up. 42 Subsequently, a double-blinded randomised controlled trial in 237 adult patients with severe COVID-19 showed that remdesivir was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits whilst adverse events were reported in 66% of patients. 47 Separately, the results of an interim analysis of the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial involving 1063 patients are more encouraging, as it indicated that patients who received redmesivir had a 31% faster time to recovery than those who received placebo (median time to recovery was 11 versus 15 days). 48 More recently, a phase 3 SIMPLE clinical trial demonstrated that patients receiving a 5-day and 10-day treatment course of remdesivir achieved similar improvements in clinical status. 49 reported in the preliminary studies included elevated hepatic enzymes, diarrhoea, constipation, hypoalbuminaemia, rash, renal impairment, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypotension. 42, 47 Potential drug-drug interactions with other medications metabolised through the cytochrome P450 system were also reported. The safety profile of this drug needs to be further evaluated. Randomised controlled trials on remdesivir are still ongoing, and two studies are in phase III of clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir. [50] [51] [52] [53] Lopinavir-ritonavir Lopinavir-ritonavir is a combination therapy used to treat HIV. Ritonavir is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 and is used to increase the plasma half-life of lopinavir. 54 Lopinavir is a protease inhibitor that has been demonstrated to have antiviral effects against SARS, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. 54, 55 Several trials have been investigating the efficacy of lopinavir-ritonavir compared with other drugs as a treatment for COVID-19. 39,56-58 Nevertheless, the results so far indicate that lopinavir-ritonavir treatment has little benefit as a standalone therapy against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a clinical trial involving 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, lopinavir-ritonavir treatment was not associated with any clinical improvements compared with standard care. 54 Furthermore, lopinavir-ritonavir treatment caused gastrointestinal adverse events, and nearly 14% of the recipients could not complete the full 14-day course of treatment. 54 Other adverse effects included gastrointestinal intolerance, hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, and QT prolongation. The use of ritonavir can cause severe drug-drug interactions in medications metabolised through the cytochrome system. The tolerance of the side effects might limit the dosage needed, as the concentration necessary to inhibit viral replication is relatively high. 54 Other clinical trials have been testing lopinavir-ritonavir combined with different drugs and different combinations such as ritonavir and interferon 1b. 39, 56 Early use of lopinavir-ritonavir as an additional treatment to ritonavir-methylprednisolone for SARS-CoV was associated with a reduction in the overall death rate and intubation rate when compared with a matched cohort. 59 A clinical phase II trial has been investigating the use of lopinavir-ritonavir combined with interferon \u03b2-1b as a treatment for MERS since 2016, but the trial is ongoing and results have yet to be published. 60 Ribavirin Ribavirin is a guanosine analogue that interferes with the replication of RNA and DNA viruses. 61 In vitro antiviral activities of Ribavirin have been demonstrated in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. 61, 62 From the experiences of SARS-CoV, the use of ribavirin as a monotherapy was limited as it required high concentration to inhibit viral replication, and ribavirin usage was associated with dose-dependent haemolysis and liver toxicity. 63, 64 In the treatment of SARS and MERS, ribavirin is used in combination with interferon or lopinavir/ritonavir. 11, 65 The use of ribavirin in combination with interferon or lopinavir/ ritonavir is recommended in the latest Chinese National Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19. 66 A recent multicentre randomised phase 2 trial showed triple antiviral therapy of lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, and interferon \u03b2-1b was superior to lopinavir-ritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms, shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID- 19. 67 Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are widely used for the treatment of malaria and certain autoimmune diseases. These drugs have an established safety profile and are readily available at relatively low cost. Hydroxychloroquine sulphate has been demonstrated to be less toxic than chloroquine phosphate in animal studies. 68 Both these drugs have been reported to have antiviral effects against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Their potential mechanisms of action include blocking viral entry into cells by inhibiting glycosylation of host receptors, reducing viral replication, and blocking the export of newly constructed virions. 45, 69 A trial in China involving more than 100 patients with Covid-19 showed that chloroquine was better able to inhibit exacerbation of pneumonia and improve lung imaging findings compared to the control treatment. 70 A recent small open-label nonrandomised clinical trial showed patients given daily hydroxychloroquine had significantly reduced viral load measured by nasopharyngeal swab on day 6. 5 However, the results in this study may have been confounded by other factors, as some patients also received azithromycin. 71 The combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin should be used with caution in patients at risk for QT prolongation. The use of chloroquine alone is also a risk factor for QT prolongation. A phase IIb clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of high-dose chloroquine was terminated early due to prolonged QTc (>500 ms) and high lethality in the high-dose group compared to the lowdose group. 72 A recent analysis of a multinational registry of 96,032 hospitalised COVID-19 patients revealed that hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine was associated with decreased in-hospital survival (mortality of 11.1 versus 9.3%) and increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmia. 73 However, concerns have been raised about the veracity of data and analyses in this study and has led to retraction of the article. 74 Other adverse effects of chloroquine include retinopathy, rash, nausea, glucose fluctuation and diarrhoea, and use of chloroquine is contraindicated in patients with porphyria. Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine should not be used to treat COVID-19 until they have been tested in clinical trials to determine the optimal dosage to balance efficacy and safety. Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine has been suggested as candidate prophylactics for COVID-19 in populations at high risk of COVID-19 infections, such as Italy and New York. 75 Other antiviral treatments Other antiviral treatments for COVID-19 currently undergoing clinical trials include protease inhibitors (nelfinavir, camostat mesilate, ritonavir, danoprevir, darunavir, flavopiridol, relacatib), nucleoside analogues (galidesivir), fusion inhibitors (umifenovir), RNA polymerase inhibitors (favipiravir), and neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir). 76"}, {"section_title": "Pharmacological therapies targeting the immune system", "text": "Corticosteroids Corticosteroid therapies such as intravenous methylprednisolone are currently being tested as a treatment for COVID-19. 77 Methylprednisolone has already been used in COVID-19 patients in combination with antibiotics, oseltamivir, and oxygen therapy. 25 Long and colleagues reported that corticosteroid therapy using methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and hydrocortisone was beneficial in treating ISSN: 1740-4398 REVIEW -Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): latest developments in potential treatments drugsincontext.com SARS-CoV patients, 78 and significantly prolonged survival time in clinical cases. 78 However, other studies reported the use of corticosteroids in early stages of SARS infection increased the viral load. 79 Furthermore, studies on the use of corticosteroids as an adjuvant therapy against MERS-CoV infection were unable to prove efficacy because all patients died. 80 Based on the recommendation by frontline Chinese physicians and local clinical experience during the SARS epidemic, a short course of corticosteroids at a low-to-moderate dose is probably justifiable for critically ill patients. 66, 81 Corticosteroids are effective in treating the autoinflammatory cytokine activation syndrome.\nReported side effects such as osteonecrosis are concerning, but data are still conflicting and recent recommendations against the use of corticosteroids are based on circumstantial evidence. Routine use of corticosteroids is not recommended as corticosteroids may prolong or worsen the disease, and were found to prolong viral shedding in MERS and SARS.

[82] [83] [84] Considering the huge number of people exposed to COVID-19, use of convalescent plasma for post-exposure prophylaxis may not be justifiable, but could still be a treatment option. An observational study during the SARS epidemic showed a lower mortality rate in those receiving convalescent plasma as a treatment for SARS. 82 Studies on the clinical effects and outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with convalescent plasma have so far shown encouraging results, although it should be noted that these studies were based on small case series. 85, 86 Furthermore, studies on the use of convalescent plasma in SARS patients did not report any significant side effects. 82, 87 Randomised trials on convalescent plasma therapy are still needed to eliminate the effects of other treatments and to investigate the safety and efficacy and optimal timing of administration. Highly purified preparations of neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 would be preferable, as it would be safer and have higher activity, but it might be technically difficult to mass produce. 84 Several pharmaceutical companies are starting to develop hyperimmune immunoglobulins against COVID-19. 88, 89 Monoclonal antibodies\nThe use of tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL-6, has recently been suggested as a treatment for COVID-19 patients at risk of cytokine storms. 90 Tocilizumab is an IL-6 inhibitor that may be effective in treating COVID-19. 91 The level of IL-6 was found to be correlated with the severity of COVID-19 and levels of C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, and T cells. 90 A retrospective study of 20 COVID-19 patients receiving tocilizumab found that 75% of them had decreased oxygen requirement. 92 According to The Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol from the China National Health Commission and State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, tocilizumab can be used in patients with extensive pulmonary lesions and in patients with increased IL-6 levels. 66 Clinical trials on the efficacy of intravenous tocilizumab as a treatment for COVID-19 are ongoing. 93, 94 However, serious adverse effects have been reported including gastrointestinal perforation, anaemia, hepatitis, and infusion reaction."}, {"section_title": "Traditional Chinese medicines and other complementary therapies", "text": "TCM employs phytotherapeutic formulations and cultural concepts that originated more than 5000 years ago. 95 The use of TCM as a coadjuvant therapy in the early stage of the SARS infection epidemic was reported to increase oxyhaemoglobin arterial saturation. 95 A Cochrane review found that Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines in SARS patients could improve symptoms, quality of life, and absorption of pulmonary infiltration, as well as decrease the corticosteroid usage. 96 Specific components such as glycyrrhizin, baicalin, and MOL376 were shown to have anti-SARS activities in vitro.
