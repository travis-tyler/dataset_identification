[{"section_title": "", "text": "No studies have examined associations between FDG metabolism and IR in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, as well as MCI conversion to AD. We studied 26 cognitively normal (CN), 194 MCI (39 MCI-progressors, 148 MCI-stable, 2 years after baseline), and 60 AD subjects with baseline FDG-PET from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Mean FDG metabolism was derived for AD-vulnerable regions of interest (ROIs), including lateral parietal and posteromedial cortices, medial temporal lobe (MTL), hippocampus, and ventral prefrontal cortices (vPFC), as well as postcentral gyrus and global cerebrum control regions. The homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) was used to measure IR. For AD, higher HOMA-IR predicted lower FDG in all ROIs. For MCI-progressors, higher HOMA-IR predicted higher FDG in the MTL and hippocampus. Control regions showed no associations. Higher HOMA-IR predicted hypermetabolism in MCI-progressors and hypometabolism in AD in medial temporal regions. Future longitudinal studies should examine the pathophysiologic significance of the shift from MTL hyper-to hypometabolism associated with IR.\nType 2 diabetes is a risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD) (1, 2) . Peripheral insulin resistance (IR), broadly defined as reduced cellular response to insulin (3), also increases AD risk even without hyperglycemia (4) . In certain brain regions with a high density of insulin receptors, insulin normally facilitates glucose metabolism (5) . Interestingly, AD-related pathology and atrophy preferentially target these same temporal, prefrontal, and posteromedial parietal areas (6) . In AD, these regions show disruption of insulin signaling (7) , and the degree of disruption in at least the hippocampus is related to worse antemortem cognition (8) . Furthermore, peripheral IR is associated with atrophy in these regions in aged rhesus macaques (9) and humans (10, 11) . The pathogenic significance of IR in AD is further highlighted by a recent study that showed brain IR preceding development of clinical AD (12) . Progressive brain hypometabolism is a hallmark of AD (13) . Glucose metabolism is often assessed using [ 18 F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). Lower FDG metabolism corresponds to declines in memory, executive function, and global cognition in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD (14) (15) (16) . There is preliminary evidence that IR inhibits glucose metabolism in AD-sensitive brain regions. For example, in euglycemic, healthy men with somatostatin-suppressed insulin secretion, insulin infusion stimulates regional metabolism in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), an effect that is diminished in men with IR (17) . Among cognitively normal (CN), aged participants with hyperglycemia, higher peripheral IR corresponds to lower resting FDG metabolism in parietal, ventral PFC, and medial temporal lobe (MTL) areas, which are particularly vulnerable to AD pathology (18) . In addition, intranasal insulin treatment in patients with MCI and early AD improves memory performance and maintains glucose metabolism in similar frontal, posteromedial, and temporal areas (14) .\nTo date, no systematic study has been conducted of the association between peripheral IR and FDG metabolism in AD-vulnerable regions across the spectrum of CN older adults, patients with MCI who later progressed to AD or remained stable, or in those with early AD. To this end, we used Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data to calculate the homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR), an index of peripheral IR. We also derived FDG metabolism in AD-sensitive regions of interest (ROIs), including ventral PFC (vPFC), MTL, hippocampus, lateral parietal cortex, posteromedial cortex, as well as postcentral gyrus and global cerebrum control regions, and studied their associations with HOMA-IR. Finally, we investigated if HOMA-IR and FDG associations remained stable when enriching MCI and AD cohorts for amyloid-positivity."}, {"section_title": "RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year public-private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. Data for cerebrospinal fluid or amyloid PET scans on 227 of 280 participants were also downloaded for a supplementary analysis (Supplementary Data). Participants were clinically diagnosed at the screening and each subsequent visit based on standardized criteria (19) .\nParticipants with MCI at baseline who remained stable by 24 months were categorized as MCI-S (n = 148) versus participants who progressed to AD and were categorized as MCI-P (n = 39). To determine MCI conversion, MCI participants were seen at 0, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months and assessed for cognitive and general function. Briefly, for an MCI participant who met criteria for probable AD on a given visit, the site physician provided diagnostic data to the ADNI Conversion Committee, which reached a consensus regarding conversion. Probable AD was in part defined as 1) a Clinical Dementia Rating of 0. 5 Written informed consent was obtained from all ADNI participants at their respective ADNI sites. The ADNI protocol was approved by site-specific institutional review boards.\nInsulin, Glucose, and HOMA-IR As described in the ADNI1 protocol manual (http://adni .loni.usc.edu/), baseline blood samples were collected from subjects after overnight fasting. Insulin was assayed from plasma using a multiplex array (Human Discovery Map; Rules-Based Medicine, Austin, TX). The least detectable dose was 0.6 mU/mL. Glucose was assayed as part of routine blood work. HOMA-IR (20) and the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) (21) were calculated from insulin and glucose values from the baseline visit. Baseline samples were collected within 14 days from baseline FDG-PET. Willette et al. (22) found that HOMA-IR is stable across at least 4 years in overweight, late middleaged humans; therefore, our index of HOMA-IR very likely reflects IR at the time of the scan. Morris et al. (23) also used baseline glucose and insulin data in ADNI to compute QUICKI and determine glycemic groups for use in cognitive and imaging analyses. Participants were defined as hyperglycemic rather than euglycemic if their fasting blood glucose levels were 100 mg/dL or greater (American Diabetes Association criterion) or were taking medication or insulin to control type 2 diabetes.

Briefly, [\n18 F]-FDG (185 MBq) was injected intravenously. After approximately 30 min, six 5-min frames were acquired. Each frame of a given baseline image series was coregistered to the first acquired frame. The image series was aggregated into a dynamic image set. The image set was then averaged, reoriented to a standard 160 3 160 3 96 voxel spatial matrix of resliced 1.5 mm 3 voxels, intensity normalized, and smoothed with an 8-mm full width at half maximum kernel. We then normalized FDG-PET pixel intensity to the pons, due to its preserved glucose metabolism in AD (30) , to derive the standardized uptake value ratio. This step removes interindividual variability in tracer metabolism. Images were spatially normalized to Montreal Neurological Institute space using an existing template in SPM8 (http:// www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/).\nFive bilateral ROIs ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ) were defined using the Wake Forest PickAtlas (http://fmri.wfubmc .edu/software/PickAtlas). ROIs were selected based on previous studies examining progressive hypometabolism across the temporal progression of AD (31, 32) or areas where glucose metabolism has been associated with IR (18) . These ROIs included hippocampus, MTL, lateral parietal, posteromedial (precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex), and vPFC. Two control regions were also examined: 1) global cerebrum, to assess the possibility of IR affecting glucose metabolism in a diffuse and regionally nonspecific manner; and 2) postcentral gyrus, because it is not vulnerable to AD pathology and its glucose metabolism does not appear to be affected by IR (18) .\nThe ADNI Biomarker Core at the University of Pennsylvania conducted ApoE genotyping. We characterized participants as being \"non-ApoE e4\" (i.e., zero ApoE e4 alleles) or \"ApoE e4\" (i.e., one to two ApoE e4 alleles)."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analyses", "text": "All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 20.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). All variables were normally distributed except for HOMA-IR, which was logtransformed to achieve normality. Linear mixed modeling, followed by least significant differences post hoc tests, was used to test whether demographics, cognition, and other variables differed by baseline diagnosis of CN, MCI, or AD (Table 1) .\nFor each ROI, we performed separate linear mixed modeling for baseline diagnosis or MCI conversion (MCI-S, MCI-P). The dependent variable was the mean FDG-PET standardized uptake value ratio for a given ROI. All models included the following covariates: age at baseline, sex, education, hyperglycemia status, ApoE e4 genotype, and mean regional GM within the ROI examined. Exploratory analyses that also included BMI did not influence results (data not shown). We examined the main effect of baseline diagnosis or MCI conversion, anticipating a stepwise decrease in FDG-PET from CN to MCI to AD, and from MCI-S to MCI-P (33). We also examined the fixed effects of HOMA-IR and the interaction of HOMA-IR 3 baseline diagnosis or HOMA-IR 3 MCI conversion to assess whether HOMA-IR was differentially associated with glucose metabolism in CN versus MCI versus AD, or MCI-S versus MCI-P. Similar analyses were done with QUICKI and yielded nearly identical results (data not shown). We addressed type 1 error by using HolmBonferroni correction (34) for all analyses. This closed test procedure maintains a family-wise a = 0.05 by requiring unadjusted P values of 0.05 divided by x, x being the number of null hypotheses tested. For example, when testing five ROIs, a P value of 0.010 is needed among one of the tested ROIs for the test to achieve significance, followed by 0.013, 0.017, 0.025, and 0.050.

Clinical groups did not show differences in HOMA-IR. However, significant interactions were found between the baseline diagnosis and HOMA-IR in all ROIs as well as interactions between MCI conversion and HOMA-IR for temporal and frontal areas. These results suggest that IR may be differentially associated with FDG metabolism depending on disease status. No HOMA-IR associations were found for the global cerebrum or postcentral gyrus control regions. Higher HOMA-IR predicted less FDG metabolism in all temporal, parietal, and frontal areas for AD participants, whereas associations were nonsignificant for CN or MCI participants. Baker et al. (18) similarly found that higher HOMA-IR predicts less FDG metabolism in these areas in hyperglycemic, CN elderly individuals. Intranasal insulin therapy maintains FDG metabolism over time in these regions in MCI and early AD patients (14) . The association of IR with glucose metabolism in these ROIs is further validated by findings that postprandial hyperglycemia (36) or somatostatinsuppressed subphysiologic insulin infusion (17) also modulate FDG metabolism in these regions.\nThree findings were of particular interest: First, in MCI-P participants, higher HOMA-IR predicted hypermetabolism in the hippocampus and MTL. Second, in MCI-S participants, higher HOMA-IR predicted vPFC hypometabolism. Third, in AD participants, higher HOMA-IR was associated with hypometabolism in hippocampus and MTL as well as the other ROIs. Collectively, these findings suggest that during the MCI stage, HOMA-IR is differentially associated with either hypo-or hypermetabolism in different brain areas, depending on whether participants progress to develop clinical AD. We depict these differential associations in Fig. 3 . Regionally specific patterns of hypo-and hypermetabolism or hypo-and hyperactivation (with FDG-PET and functional MRI, respectively) have been seen in populations at risk for AD and have been implicated in the transition to clinical AD. Hyperactivation and increased functional connectivity of the hippocampus and MTL has been proposed as an early compensatory response to the presence of amyloid in default mode network regions (37) (38) (39) . Middle-aged, predemented individuals with Down syndrome, who are at high risk for AD, also show relative MTL hypermetabolism (40) , as do aged individuals with subjective memory impairment (41) . In addition, higher mean amyloid deposition in the precuneus corresponds to hypermetabolism in MCI and hypometabolism in AD in frontal and parietoccipital areas (42) , suggesting that this hyperactivation is transient and gives way to hypoactivation in AD.\nPrevious studies have also shown positive associations between measures related to IR and brain indices, such as volume, in MCI/early AD and aged monkeys. Higher insulin area under the curve from a glucose tolerance test, which reflects higher IR, predicts better cognitive performance and more hippocampal volume cross-sectionally (43) and longitudinally (44) in MCI/early AD. Similarly, in aged rhesus macaques not on long-term calorie restriction, less insulin sensitivity is related to higher hippocampal volume (9) . The underlying mechanism behind these IR associations with volume and FDG metabolism in the MTL in MCI/early AD is currently unclear. Hyperinsulinemia, a feature of IR, is related to higher insulin concentrations in the brain (45) . Higher brain insulin concentrations may reduce amyloid oligomerization and toxicity (46) , increase synaptogenesis (47), or modulate long-term potentiation and depression in the hippocampus to improve learning and memory (45) . These phenomena may be the basis of a compensatory effect of IR at some transient stage during AD pathogenesis. Also unclear is whether IR directly affects FDG through changes in glucose metabolism or indirectly. Talbot et al. (8) found that physiologic and supraphysiologic insulin administration in CN and AD postmortem hippocampal tissue did not affect glucose metabolism. Yet, insulin infusion in somatostatin-suppressed men (17) or intranasal insulin in MCI and AD both affected MTL FDG metabolism (14) . Alternatively, a potential indirect mechanism underlying IR and FDG associations may be differences in regional amyloid deposition. Higher amyloid in the precuneus, as measured by Pittsburgh Compound B, corresponds to hypermetabolism in MCI and hypometabolism in AD (42) .\nAs a limitation, our sample size for CN was small, and thus, the lack of associations for this group should be interpreted with caution. Our most intriguing finding was the positive relationship of HOMA-IR with MTL and hippocampus FDG in MCI-P, in line with the findings of higher resting state activity or FDG metabolism in MTL (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) as well as higher IR and higher hippocampal volume in MCI/early AD participants and aged rhesus monkeys (9, 43, 44) . Our findings further motivate ongoing therapeutic efforts for treating AD by targeting peripheral and/or central IR, including the on-going clinical trials of exenatide (NCT01255163) and intranasal insulin (NCT01767909), and support their rationale of recruiting subjects at the stage of MCI when IR may be exercising different effects from those seen in AD. Completion of these and future trials will ultimately test whether targeting IR is a viable strategy for AD therapeutics."}]
