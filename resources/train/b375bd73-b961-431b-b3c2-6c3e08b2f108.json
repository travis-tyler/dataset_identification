We found a similar pattern-on average, the $100,000+ farm households had higher consumption when incomes were low and lower consumption when incomes were high relative to households with similar levels of income operating very small rural-residence farms.\nWhen households are ranked from lowest to highest based on current income levels, farm households have higher income per person than all U.S. households at all but the lowest level of household income. The net effect of predominantly higher income, but a lower tendency to increase consumption as income increases, is that the farm household distribution of consumption is very similar to that of all U.S. households. Farm households appear to have higher consumption at the low end of the distribution, and lower consumption at the upper end of the distribution, compared with all U.S. households. Analogously, the relative levels of disadvantage are reversed when we switch from an income-poverty rate to a consumptionpoverty rate, calculated by comparing household consumption to the census poverty threshold. The consumption poverty rate is lower for persons in farm households than for persons in all U.S. households. The divergence in income and consumption measures between farm and all U.S. households is even greater when we focus on households that operate farms with sales of $100,000 or more, which are more exposed to the income risks of self-employment.\nAt the individual household level, there is not a close mapping between the income and consumption measures for farm households compared with U.S. households. Among households that rank in the bottom 20 percent for household income, farm households are far more likely to rank high in the consumption distribution than are all U.S. households, indicating farm households are more likely either to view their income as temporarily low, or to have suffi cient wealth to spend more than they earn. Analogously, among households that rank in the top 20 percent of the income distribution, farm households are far more likely to rank low in the consumption distribution than are U.S. households, indicating they view their current income as temporarily high. The greater divergence implies that income is a less effective proxy for consumption-an indicator of long-term standard of living-for farm households than for most other U.S. households. Consequently, consumption indicators are an important complement to income indicators for understanding farm household well-being.\nEconomic Research Service / USDA\nEconomic Research Service / USDA Ideally, we would conduct the test of income variability and consumption with panel data. However, lacking panel data capturing the same farm households across multiple years, we test for consumption smoothing across income levels in our cross-sectional data for 2006. The underlying assumption is that greater income dispersion at a point in time is associated with greater intertemporal variability as well, so that current incomes at the low and high ends of the distribution are less likely to be representative of long-term, or \"permanent,\" income for farm households than for all U.S. households. For example, the operators of large farms, who have the highest average household income but whose farm income is most variable from year to year, are disproportionately represented at both the top and bottom of the income distribution.\nWe compare how patterns of consumption-smoothing relative to income levels differ between household groups with more and less income variability. We fi rst compare farm households and all U.S. households. In addition, among farm households, we compare households operating farms with annual sales greater than $100,000 and households operating very small rural-residence farms (with sales less than $10,000 and a principal operator whose primary occupation is not farming).\nEconomic Research Service / USDA Though very small rural-residence farms represent about 40 percent of U.S. farms, they produce a negligible portion of total sales.

Total household income is a third higher than for all U.S. households, but the shares of income deriving from self-employment income (from farm and nonfarm sources) and from wages and salary are comparable to those of all U.S. households. The share with negative household income cannot be reported due to small sample size, but the estimate is substantially smaller than the overall farm household share (6.0 percent).\nIn contrast, farms with $100,000 or more in sales represented 16 percent of farms and produced 89 percent of total sales in 2006.

The answer depends upon whether well-being is measured by available resources or by standard of living. Past research has relied primarily on measures of current-year money income and wealthindicators of resources available to the household. Many analysts agree that capturing standard of living by measuring goods and services consumed in the current year is an alternative measure of well-being with a number of advantages (Cutler and Katz, 1991; Hurd and Rohwedder, 2006; Johnson et al., 2005; Jorgenson, 1998; Meyer and Sullivan, 2003; and Rogers and Gray, 1994) . Households tend to smooth consumption over time, given temporary increases or decreases in income, in order to maintain their standard of living. Consequently, consumption better approximates lifetime well-being for a given household than current-year income.\nTheory and empirical evidence imply a more pronounced difference between money income and consumption for households less reliant on money income and/or where income is highly variable across years. The literature has studied two populations where income is a poor proxy for a consumption measure of well-being: low-income populations, who receive private and public transfers from outside of the household and who may have higher underreporting of income (Jorgenson, 1998; Meyer and Sullivan, 2003; Slesnick, 2001) ; and the elderly, who have relatively high levels of wealth but low current income (Hurd and Rohwedder, 2006) . This report focuses on another population for which income may be a weak proxy for standard of living: farm households which, like other selfemployed households, typically have more variable income and higher wealth than the average U.S. household."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Well-Being of Farm Operator Households Versus All U.S. Households: Income and Wealth Measures, 1996-2006", "text": "First, we defi ne who is a farmer and identify the data sources for our reporting.

Because we are interested in the households of the principal farm operators, we restrict our analysis to \"family farms,\" those in which majority ownership of the farm business is held by the operator and relatives of the operator. Most farms (96 percent in 2006) are family owned and operated. For family farms, we identify the principal operator of the operation, and collect information for that individual's household. About 10 percent of family farms have other operators who live in separate households; these households are not included in the population. 1 In this section, we use the full family-farm sample from USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS), a joint effort by ERS and the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, to describe the demographics and economics of farm households. (See Appendix A for more information about data sources.) ARMS is a major source of information for reporting offi cial USDA statistics on farm income and farm household income and wealth. 2 The calculation of household income in ARMS includes: a detailed calculation of farm income, based on farm output, revenue, expenses, and depreciation; the allocation of farm income among stakeholders, including the principal operator, and the nonfarm income of the principal operator's household from earned and unearned sources. 3 ARMS also reports farm and nonfarm household wealth and household expenditure data. For all U.S. households, we rely on the Current Population Survey for income data and the triennial Survey of Consumer Finance for wealth data.

About 40 percent of farms have more than one operator; however, for three-quarters of the farms with multiple operators, the farm is operated by a husband-wife team, so that both operators are part of the same \"principal operator\" household on which we focus.\n2 See ERS Briefi ng Rooms on Farm Income and Costs (http://www.ers. usda.gov/Briefi ng/FarmIncome/), Farm Household Economics and Well-Being (http://www.ers.usda.gov/Briefi ng/ WellBeing/), and ARMS (http://www. ers.usda.gov/Briefi ng/ARMS/) for more information.\n3 Other net self-employment income is elicited directly from the respondent, as in the Current Population Survey. Though the CPS survey manual indicates that self-employment income is to be reported net of depreciation, this guidance does not appear on the survey form in CPS. Checks comparing farm self-employment income between CPS and ARMS suggest that the typical respondent does not deduct depreciation, resulting in lower estimates of farm self-employment income in ARMS than in CPS. 4 The Gini coeffi cient is a ratio with values between 0 and 1: 0 corresponds to perfect equality (everyone having exactly the same income) and 1 corresponds to perfect inequality (where one person has all the income, while everyone else has zero income). Consequently, a low Gini coeffi cient indicates a more equal income or wealth distribution, while a high Gini coeffi cient indicates a more unequal distribution. it was above the median for all U.S. households, and in other years, it was below it. Since 1998, median income for farm operator households has exceeded median income of all U.S. households by 3 to 21 percent (table 1) .\nIncome levels are more disparate among farm households, as refl ected in consistently higher Gini coeffi cients, than among all U.S. households. However, the Gini coeffi cients are converging: the Gini for all U.S. households rose from 0.455 in 1996 to 0.470 in 2006, implying widening income inequality, whereas the Gini for farm households fell from 0.647 to 0.582. Two other measures of dispersion, the ratio of income at the 80th and 20th percentiles and at the 90th and 10th percentiles, focus specifi cally on the distance between the upper and lower tails of the distribution. For the 80:20 ratio, farm and all U.S. households do converge in 2006 to the same value; for the 90:10 ratio, the gap is shrinking (table 1) . Further, farm households have consistently higher income-based poverty rates (14.4 percent for farm households versus 12.3 percent for U.S. households in 2006) and larger shares with negative household income each year (5-8 percent of farm house- holds, compared with 0.1 percent for all U.S. households across the period) (table 1).\nThe greater income variability among farm households from one year to another can be attributed to the greater share of self-employment income among farm households. Self-employment income is more likely to be negative in a given year due to the variability of business results, as well as to variability in how much production is allocated to inventory rather than sales in a given year and in depreciation expenses from recent capital expenditures. For all U.S. households, the share of income from self-employment averages about 5 percent over 1996-2006 ( Recognizing the variability of income across years and the importance of wealth to sustain consumption amid temporary declines in income, introduced a four-quadrant well-being indicator. It separates households into low-and high-income and low-and high-wealth, using the U.S. household medians for money income and wealth as the dividing lines. The combination of low income and low wealth is interpreted as an indication of \"economic disadvantage.\" Using 2000 data, 6 percent of the U.S. farm population was in the low-income/low-wealth category. As the wellbeing of farm households (both income and wealth) improved over the next 6 years, the share of disadvantaged households fell to 3 percent in 2006. Figure 1 compares the four-quadrant distributions of farm and all U.S. In this chapter, we explore why patterns of consumption behavior may differ for farm households relative to all U.S. households. Then, we outline our approach for constructing consistent consumption measures in the Consumer Expenditure (CE) and ARMS survey data."}, {"section_title": "Consumption Behavior of Farm Households Versus All U.S. Households", "text": "In its simplest form, the permanent income hypothesis (PIH) of consumption and savings behavior posits that the choices made by consumers are determined not by current income but by longer term income expectations. 7 The concept of permanent income is based on the lifetime earning capacity of household real wealth, which includes both physical (real property and fi nancial) and human (education and experience) assets. Measured current income typically contains a permanent component, which is anticipated and planned, and a transitory element, which may be unexpected. The concept of consumption differentiates outlays that result in current enjoyment of goods and services from those that refl ect (at least in part) savings for future enjoyment, including the purchase of durable goods such as housing or vehicles, and fi nancial assets such as retirement accounts and insurance.\nA major implication of the permanent income hypothesis is that-in the face of current income variability around permanent income-consumers will seek to allocate resources in order to smooth the marginal utility of consumption relative to current income. Household groups with higher shares of transitory income, such as the households of farm operators and other selfemployed individuals, are predicted to have lower propensities to consume from current income. Indeed, Friedman (1957) cited this explanation for his fi nding that the elasticity of consumption with respect to current income was lower for farmers than for nonfarmers.\nWhereas 15 years ago the literature interpreted the PIH theory as badly dated, more recent re-formulation of the theory, combined with improved data availability, has reinvigorated this line of research. 8 In recent years, a number of empirical studies have explored predictions from various versions of the permanent income hypothesis. DeJuan and Seater (2006) , analyzing CE data, found that the income-elasticity of consumption is lower for households with greater transitory income. Whittaker and Effl and (2009), using 2003-05 ARMS data, found that increases in relatively stable nonfarm income have a greater impact on farm household spending than do increases in farm production income, which can vary from year to year because of weather, crop failures, animal losses, and/or commodity price fl uctuations.\nThe theory predicts that the level of income variability is an important driver of the extent of consumption-smoothing behavior. Mishra and Sandretto (2002) document the substantial intertemporal variability of farm household income over the past seven decades, and suggest that variability has not declined during this period."}, {"section_title": "8", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Creating Consistent Expenditure and Consumption Measures With ARMS and CE Data", "text": "In our analysis, consumption refers to own-household consumption during the current year. The household consumption measure of standard of livingthe value of service fl ows received by the household in the current period-is closely related to living expenses (current expenditures), but differs in key ways, requiring three (sometimes impractical) adjustments:\n\u2022 The fi rst adjustment is to separate the investment or savings component of expenditures from current consumption. For consumer durables such as housing and vehicles, this can be done by replacing current outlays with the estimated annual fl ow of consumer services. Also, expenditures that represent savings-such as on disability/life insurance and retirement plans-are excluded from the consumption measure. Some argue that education and health expenditures are more appropriately interpreted as investments and should be excluded, but we do not attempt to do so here.\n\u2022 A second adjustment is to separate out net expenditures on other households, such as alimony and child support, gifts, and charitable contributions.\n\u2022 A third adjustment is to capture goods and services consumed without private economic transactions (and therefore without household fi nancial expenditures)-including leisure, public goods, and in-kind transfers (such as Medicare direct payments to health providers).\nThe categories in the current ARMS living expense (or household expenditure) questions were modeled after the major categories used in the Consumer Expenditure (CE) Survey, the most comprehensive source of expenditure data for U. for more details of the mapping between CE and ARMS categories and other aspects of the construction of the consumption measures in the two survey data sets.)\nThe CE survey collects data on over 200 expenditure items, whereas the ARMS survey now collects data on 10 items. Survey research indicates that the estimated value of an aggregate that depends on summing many components varies with the number of components that are measured. The reasoning is that each component is composed of subcomponents, and respondents will not remember all the subcomponents when reporting the value of the component (Weinberg et al., 1999) . Thus, increasing the number of components that are queried will tend to increase the aggregate of the components. 9\nBy this logic, the ARMS could have a tendency to understate total expenditures. Consequently, we recognize that the ARMS data may be subject to a downward bias, particularly for the aggregated category \"all else.\" In its offi cial reporting of CE data, BLS does not report a consumption measure. However, a number of researchers have calculated a consumption measure from CE data (Johnson et al., 2005; Sullivan, 2003, 2009 ).\nWe make parallel adjustments to expenditure data in CE and ARMS in order to calculate consistent consumption measures from the two surveys.\nThe fi rst set of adjustments relates to separating out savings components of expenditures. For the two durable goods, housing and vehicles, we replace expenditures with the value of estimated service fl ows for shelter and vehicle services. We retain education expenditures (in \"all else\") and health expenditures (as a separate item), but drop expenditures on personal insurance and retirement plans in the analysis samples to calculate consumption for both survey samples.\nThree categories are treated as disposable goods and services (i.e., their expenditures are included directly in the consumption measure)-food, health care, and all else. And in order to drop contributions to other households from our measure of consumption, we exclude the ARMS expenditure category \"charitable contributions and contributions to other households\" and the CE category \"cash contributions.\" 10 CE and ARMS provide limited opportunities to capture goods and services consumed without private economic transactions-our consumption measure does not include leisure, public goods, or barter. One in-kind transfer captured in the food category for both data sets-at least in concept-is food purchased with food stamps. 11 In addition, ARMS allows us to include for farm households \"in-kind farm production for household consumption.\""}, {"section_title": "Calculating Per-Person Equivalence Measures", "text": "Household consumption is subject to economies of scale, where two (or more) people can attain a given standard of living more cheaply in one household than in separate households.

Following Johnson et al. (2005) , we use the single-parameter, constantelasticity equivalence scale, an approach used more frequently in 9 The ARMS question eliciting the \"all else\" measure specifi cally mentions all of the major categories of consumption in the CE survey included in the \"all else\" category, including entertainment, apparel, household furnishings and equipment, education, child (or adult) care, personal care and services; the only major categories not mentioned are alcohol, tobacco products, and reading, which represented 1.1 percent, 0.7 percent, and 0.3 percent of U.S. household consumption in 2006.\nEconomic Research Service / USDA international comparisons of inequality (Johnson and Shipp, 1999) .

Average household size is essentially the same for households of principal farm operators and all U.S. households (2.7 versus 2.5 persons). Not surprisingly, the average age of principal farm operators (57) is greater than for the reference person in CE households (49); however, the average number of farm household members over age 65 is only slightly greater (0.5 versus 0.3 person). Farm operators are much more likely to live in a nonmetro area than all U.S. households (60.6 percent versus 14.6 percent), but have comparable rates of college and post-college education.\nTurning to income measures, we observe the familiar pattern of higher household income for farm operator households relative to all U.S. households.

The fi rst critical difference regarding home ownership between the two populations is that three-quarters of farm operator households report they live in a residence owned by the farm. Virtually all of the rest (around 20 percent) report owning their own home, with only 2 percent reporting that they rent their dwelling. In contrast, among all U.S. households, two-thirds report owning their own home and one-third report renting.

The income shocks typically needed to generate negative household income are likely transitory, so we expect that permanent income may be substantially higher for households with negative current income. For example, nearly 6 percent of farm households had negative income in 2006 (compared to 0.2 percent for all U.S. households), but their average household net worth of $1.3 million is comparable to farm households with equivalent-income of $70,000-$124,999 (table 5). The average share that self-employment provides of total household income is negative in the second income category ($1-$19,999) for farm households, but increases to over 50 percent in the top two income groupings ($125,000-$224,999 and $225,000 and above).\nEconomic Research Service / USDA As expected, the ratio of consumption to income decreases as income increases for both farm households and all U.S. households. Also as expected, the fl atter consumption-income relationship for farm households illustrates their lower propensity to increase consumption with higher income in a given year, in order to accommodate greater income variability from year to year.\nOur expectation is that, when income is unexpectedly low, farm households will be less inclined to cut back essentials such as food compared to similar households with more stable income, and when income is unexpectedly high, they will be less inclined to expand discretionary purchases. To assess whether we observe such behavior, we also report-for each equivalentincome category-the consumption shares for the fi ve consumption components. We expect food shares will decline and \"all else\" shares will increase with income, except for the group with negative household income-we anticipate this group has positive and substantially higher permanent income, and so will display patterns comparable to a higher equivalent-income category.\nThe trends across income levels in consumption shares by type are comparable in the two populations: consumption shares for food, housing, health careand for farm households, home consumption-basically decrease as income grows; shares for transportation increase until the upper tail of the distribution, where they decrease; and shares of \"all else\" increase across income levels. Households with negative household income are an exception to the pattern. For the most part, shares of \"all else\" consumption are lower for farm households; however, the rates of increase in the shares are the same for farm and all U.S. households.

As such, current income is a weaker proxy for current standard of living for farm (and other self-employed households) than for all U.S. households.\nThe two-way distributions in table 7 were inspired by the earlier work of Rogers and Gray (1994) , who compared quintiles of income to quintiles of outlays for all U.S. households using 1992 CE data. If current income were a good predictor of consumption, we would expect households to be concentrated along the diagonals, where the household quintile ranking in the consumption distribution matches its ranking in the income distribution; alternatively, if the two were uncorrelated, a random distribution would suggest 20 percent in each cell in the income row.\nEquivalent-income and equivalent-consumption quintiles: For U.S. households, the diagonal cells have the largest share of households along each row in the income-consumption table. The effect is strongest for the fi rst and fi fth quintiles: notably, 58 percent of households in the lowest income quintile are in the lowest consumption quintile, and 56 percent of households in the highest income quintile are in the highest consumption quintile. The other diagonal cells have about one-third of their row totals. Farm households are more likely to be off-diagonal. For example, among farm households, those in the lowest income quintile are much more likely to be in one of the three highest consumption quintiles than is evident for all U.S. households (39 percent of farm versus 22 percent of all U.S. households). Analogously, farm households in the highest income quintile are much more likely to be in the three lowest consumption quintiles (34 percent of farm versus 15 percent of all U.S. households)."}, {"section_title": "Income-wealth quintiles:", "text": "The fi nal two-way comparison in table 7 is income versus net worth quintiles for farm households. The divergence in ranking between income and wealth is particularly strong for those in the fi rst income-quintile (53 percent of which are in the top three wealth quintiles). This is consistent with households that operate commercial farms with an extensive asset base experiencing large income dips in a given year.\nIn sum, the extensive divergence in quintile ranking between income and consumption indicates that current farm household income is more variable than the long-term, or permanent, household income that drives consumption.\nSince wealth provides a source of assets to draw down or to borrow against during temporary income shortfalls, the even stronger pattern of divergence between income and wealth quintiles for farm households further supports this inference."}, {"section_title": "25", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Households, as Indicated by Income and Consumption", "text": "Household income of farm households, compared to all U.S. households, is higher at the mid-point of the distribution, but also is more dispersed-lower at the low end of the distribution and higher at the high end; as a result, farm household income is higher at all deciles but the fi rst, compared to all U.S. households (fi g. 6). Farm households also have a lower tendency to increase consumption as income increases than do all U.S. households. What, then, is the net effect of these countervailing patterns on the distribution of consumption levels in the two populations?\nTo illustrate the different perspectives on relative well-being of farm and all U.S. households afforded by income and consumption measures, table 8 presents the values at each decile of the income and consumption distributions for the two populations. As a benchmark for the income data in the smaller consumption-analysis samples, column 1 of table 8 reports the value of equivalent-income at each decile, using CPS for all U.S. households and the full ARMS sample (with data from all fi ve survey versions) for farm households. Columns 2 and 3 report the values at the deciles of equivalent-income and equivalent consumption, respectively, using the CE (for all U.S. households) and the ARMS (for all farm households) consumption-analysis samples.\nComparing the distribution of equivalent-income in columns 1 and 2 indicates that the ARMS consumption-analysis sample understates farm household income (relative to the full ARMS sample) at the 90 th percentile and the CE income distribution understates all U.S. household income (relative to CPS) throughout the distribution. As a result, the farm household dominance in household income appears even greater in column 2 relative to column 1, except at the 80 th and 90 th percentiles. In column 3, we see that the net effect of predominantly higher income, but a lower propensity to consume as income increases, is that the farm household distribution of consumption is very similar to that for all U.S. households. The similarities are strongest for the 30 th , 40 th , and 50 th percentiles of the distribution. At the tails of the distributions, the pattern appears to be reversed from that of the income distribution: farm households appear better off at the low end of the distribution and worse off at the high end of the distribution, relative to all U.S. households.\nWe need to qualify the results at the upper end of the distribution because we are not able to rule out the possibility that measurement error could understate consumption levels at the upper end; in addition, there is attrition from the sample of the highest-income farm households, resulting in lower income at the 90 th percentile.\nOur fi nal indicator of well-being focuses on the low end of the distributionincome and consumption poverty rates. A convention in the literature is to calculate consumption poverty by comparing a household's consumption level to the census poverty threshold for the composition of that household, used to determine offi cial income-based poverty rates. If consumption is a better indicator of standard of living for households where money income is less predominant as a resource and/or where income is highly variable across years, then consumption poverty may be a better measure of economic disadvantage than the offi cial census income-based measure (Jorgenson, 1998; Meyers and Sullivan, 2003; Slesnick, 2001) . The census poverty threshold incorporates an adjustment for household size (including age composition), one that is different from the equivalency measure employed in our data analysis. Consequently, poverty rates are calculated on total income and total consumption measures.\nFor the farm population (based on the ARMS analysis sample), poverty drops from 13.8 percent (14.4 percent in full ARMS sample) based on the offi cial census income-poverty measure to 7.8 percent for the consumption-poverty measure. For all U.S. households (based on the CE analysis sample), poverty drops from 11.8 percent (12.3 percent in CPS) based on the offi cial Census income-poverty measure to 9.2 percent for the consumption-poverty measure. Whereas farm households have a higher income-poverty rate, they have a lower consumption-poverty rate than all U.S. households.\nIn table 9 and fi gure 7, we report the per-person equivalent-income and equivalent-consumption distributions for households operating $100,000+ sales farms and very small rural-residence farms, two farm household subgroups that differ substantially in the extent of exposure to income variability from self-employment. Per-person equivalent-income is much more dispersed for households operating the larger farms than for households operating the very small farms, a pattern that affects both tails of the distribution: the larger-farm household income is lower at the low end of the distribution (indeed negative until the 14 th percentile compared to below the 2 nd percentile for the very small farms), and higher at the high end of the distribution. However, the propensity to consume is suffi ciently lower among the larger-farm households that the consumption distributions are very similar. Analogously, the income-poverty rates are quite divergent (22 percent for $100,000+ sales farms versus 7 percent for very small rural-residence farms), but the consumption-poverty rates are roughly 6 percent for both groups. To further understand the relative well-being of farm households, it is also instructive to compare all U.S. households (table 8, fi gure 6) with the subgroup of large-farm households (table 9, fi gure 7). Though large family farms (farms with sales of $100,000 or more) represent only 16 percent of farms, they produced 89 percent of total farm sales in 2006. At the low end of the income and consumption distributions, large-farm households have substantially lower equivalent-income, but higher equivalent-consumption, than the population of all family-farm households-which further increases the farm-all U.S divergence on the two measures. The differences at the low end are refl ected in the poverty rates: income poverty is 22 percent among persons living in large-farm households, compared to 14 percent for persons in all farm households and 12 percent for all U.S. households; whereas consumption-poverty is 6 percent for persons living in large-farm households, compared to 8 percent in all farm households and 9 percent in all U.S. households.\nAt the high end of the income and consumption distributions, large-farm households have substantially higher equivalent-income, but-due to their higher exposure to income risk and their lower marginal propensity to consume-only slightly higher equivalent-consumption than all family-farm households. As a result, at the upper end of the consumption distribution, the consumption levels of large-farm households are very similar to those of all U.S. households. "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "ERS publishes indicators of economic well-being for farm operator households. To date, the focus has been on income-and wealth-based measures calculated from the annual survey of farm households conducted by USDA (ARMS). In this report, we present estimates of a consumption measure for farm households calculated using revised ARMS expenditure questions, and benchmark the measure against the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE).\nTo assess the possibility of distortions introduced into the comparison from using surveys with different elicitation methods for expenditures, we conducted within-survey comparisons: within CE, we compared data for a sample of farm households created by pooling data for 2005-07 with data for all U.S. households; within ARMS, we compared data for two farm household subgroups that diverge substantially in their degree of reliance on farm income. The results support the reasonableness of the fi ndings.\nCiting extensive literature on household well-being, we argue on conceptual grounds that current consumption of goods and services provides an important complement to income and wealth in characterizing household economic well-being. Whereas income and wealth are important indicators of resources, current consumption is an indicator of current material standard of living. Further, consumption provides useful information about a household's lifetime standard of living because, when households face temporary increases or decreases in income relative to long-term income expectations, they tend to smooth consumption relative to variable income in order to maintain a standard of living linked to their long-term income expectations.\nAt an individual household level, there is not a close mapping between the income and consumption measures for farm households, compared with all U.S. households. Also, across the population, the consumption measure provides a different perspective than income and wealth on the distribution of well-being among farm households relative to all U.S. households. Farm households appear to have higher equivalent-income than all U.S. households at all income deciles but the lowest. But farm households, which are exposed to greater income volatility, have lower marginal propensities to consume from current income. The net effect is that the distribution of consumption appears to be similar for farm and all U.S. households. However, for farm households, the data suggest that consumption is higher at the low end of the distribution and lower at the high end of the distribution relative to all U.S. households.\nAnalogously, using poverty rates as an indicator of disadvantage within the populations, the relative levels of disadvantage are reversed when we switch from an income-poverty rate to a consumption-poverty rate, calculated by comparing household consumption to the census poverty threshold employed in offi cial U.S. income poverty statistics. Whereas the income poverty rate is higher, the consumption poverty rate is lower for farm households relative to all U.S. households. The divergence in income-and consumption-poverty rates between farm and all U.S. households is even greater when we focus on households that operate farms with sales of $100,000 or more, which are more exposed to the income risks of self-employment.\nEconomic Research Service / USDA collecting economic information from farm businesses. 3 The unit of observation, then, is the household of the principal operator."}, {"section_title": "Expenditure/consumption analysis sample:", "text": "To analyze consumption and expenditures, we use a sample constructed from questionnaire version 1, the only version in which detailed household expenditure data are elicited.
