However, its contribution to the pathogenesis of AD remains unclear to date. Here, we addressed the role of EPHA1 in AD by investigating the influence of EPHA1 on cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers in three clinical stages from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We did not detect significant association of EPHA1 with amyloid-\u2424 deposition or tau protein. However, the A-allele in the mild cognitive impairment group remarkably prevented hippocampal atrophy (partial correlation coefficient 2.812, 95% CI 0.651 to 4.973) at two-year follow-up. Additionally, AD subjects with the A-allele displayed less atrophy and greater cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl) in the right lateral occipitotemporal gyrus (volume: partial correlation coefficient 540.10, 95% CI 247.26 to 832.95; CMRgl: partial correlation coefficient 0.056, 95% CI 0.024 to 0.087) and inferior temporal gyrus (volume: partial correlation coefficient 327.98, 95% CI 11.65 to 644.31; CMRgl: partial correlation coefficient 0.055, 95% CI 0.019 to 0.091) at baseline. This study suggests EPHA1 (rs11771145) interferes with the pathological alteration of the hippocampus and the lateral occipitotemporal and inferior temporal gyri throughout the AD process, leading to a lower risk of AD.

The revised recommendations suggested that the histological pathology of AD may be found across a broad clinical spectrum (normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia due to AD), and might be detected by specific abnormality on various biomarkers. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, amyloid-\u2424 (A\u2424 42 ) and tau protein (both total tau and phosphorylated tau), display significant lower and higher levels, respectively, in the AD process; and AD patients present with disproportionate atrophy in medial, basal, and lateral temporal lobe, and medial parietal cortex on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), decreased18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake on position emission tomography (PET) in temporoparietal cortex, and positive amyloid imaging on Pittsburgh Compound B position emission tomography (PiB-PET) [2, 3] . In addition, the guidelines admitted the role of genetic factors in the development of AD. To date, only the APOE genetic variant was well replicated to be associated with AD worldwide [4] , and strongly related to the CSF and neuroimaging biomarkers in the AD process [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] ; however, it is estimated that variation at the APOE locus may explain 50% or less of late-onset AD risk [4] , indicating that additional risk loci affecting late-onset AD exist.\nEphrin type-A receptor 1 (EPHA1) has been identified and confirmed as an AD susceptibility gene in genome wide association studies in Caucasians [11] [12] [13] . Recently, EPHA1 (11771145) was demonstrated to be the most strongly associated locus with AD at EPHA1 in a meta-analysis of five published genome wide association studies in individuals of European ancestry [14] .

However, we did not observe significant difference on other regional CMRgl in the other two groups (NC or MCI) at baseline."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "This present study investigated the effects of EPHA1 genotypes (GG, AG, and AA) on CSF and neuroimaging biomarkers in three clinical stages (NC, MCI, and AD). We observed that the EPHA1 gene mutation did not affect the levels of A\u2424 42 in CSF nor the A\u2424 42 deposition in PiB-PET in the three periods. On the other hand, the A-allele did not increase or decrease the concentration of t-tau or p-tau 181p in CSF analysis. However, AD patients with the A-allele displayed both less loss and higher cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl) in the right lateral occipitotemporal and inferior temporal gyri in neuroimaging examination at baseline. Furthermore, the A-allele in MCI subjects remarkably prevented right hippocampal atrophy at the two-year follow-up. To our knowledge, our investigation was the first study to explore the role of EPHA1 rs11771145 in CSF and neuroimaging phenotypes and detected that EPHA1 was associated with the pathological and metabolic alteration of right hippocampus and occipitotemporal and inferior temporal gyri.\nEPHA1, EPH receptor A1 (ephrin type-A receptor 1), is one member of the ephrin receptor subfamily from the protein-tyrosine kinase family [18] . EPH and EPH-related receptors participate in mediating developmental events, particularly in the nervous system [19] . Receptors in the EPH subfamily typically have a single kinase domain and an extracellular region containing a Cys-rich domain and 2 fibronectin type III repeats [18] . It has been documented that EPHA1 is implicated in immune system function [20] , synaptic dysfunction [21, 22] , and cell membrane processes [23] , which are all related to the occurrence of AD [24] . Thus, we investigated the mechanism underlying the interaction between EPHA1 and AD in this study, and found that right inferior temporal and right lateral occipitotemporal gyri displayed both less loss and higher CMRgl in A-allele carriers in the AD group at baseline, and A-allele significantly inhibited right hippocampal atrophy in the MCI group at follow-up, suggesting that EHPHA1 plays an important role in AD-related neurodegenerative processes.\nAbnormal accumulation of A\u2424 42 in neurotic fibrillar plaques occurs firstly throughout the AD pathophysiological process, which can be detected by the decreased levels of A\u2424 42 in CSF and positive amyloid imaging in PiB-PET examination. In the present study, we did not observe a significant relationship between A\u2424 42 levels and EPHA1 in CSF, nor the correlation between PiB uptake values and EPHA1 in PiB-PET analysis. The following hallmark was the presence of tau-mediated neuronal injury and dysfunction after the pathological A\u2424 42 deposition, which manifests as increased tau levels (both t-tau and p-tau 181p ) in CSF examination. Likewise, these findings did not support the relationship between EPHA1 and tau protein. However, the lower power from the small sample size limited the final interpretation of the relationship between A\u2424 42 deposition, tau, and EPHA1.\nNext, AD-related pathologic degeneration arises stealthily, which could be determined by the disproportionate atrophy in temporal cortex on MRI, and decreased CMRgl on PET in temporo-parietal cortex. Here, we selected temporal lobe as the brain region most affected by AD, and detected that lateral occipitotemporal and inferior temporal gyrus were significantly associated with the A-allele at EPHA1 gene in AD subjects. It has been demonstrated the lateral occipitomporal gyrus has a higher number of neurofibrillary tangles in AD patients than that in normal cognitive individuals [25] . Besides, inferior temporal lobe is one of the most strongly associated brain regions with metabolic and cognitive decline indicative of AD dementia [26] , which displays A\u2424 42 deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, and synaptic loss in AD pathology [27, 28] , and has been demonstrated to be associated with AD in PET examination [28] . Furthermore, we tested the influence of EPHA1 on the volume of hippocampus (the most strongly associated structure marker with AD) in the two-year follow-up study, and the A-allele in MCI subjects markedly prevented the atrophy in right hippocampus. Therefore, it is possible that EPHA1 (rs11771145) could affect the histological pathology and glucose metabolism of hippocampus and lateral occipitomporal and inferior temporal gyri from participating in the AD pathological process, leading to influence the development and progression of AD.\nThere are several potential limitations in this study. First, the ADNI-1 sample was limited in sample size when considering longitudinal imaging data of specific genotypes and diagnosis subgroups, and it will still be necessary to replicate these findings in a larger dataset. Second, a follow-up of two years may be too short to detect the significant influence of EPHA1 on the AD process, and an increase of follow-up is useful to detect a stronger influence of EPHA1 genetic variation. Moreover, except hippocampus and temporal lobe, other regions, such as anterior cingulate, precuneus cortex, and frontal, parietal and occipital cortexes were indicated to be associated with AD in recent studies. Finally, our sample was restricted to Caucasians to avoid genetics stratification across ethnicities. EPHA1 (rs11771145), however, has different frequencies and polymorphisms in different population; thus, our results cannot represent other ethnicities, and replications in other populations are imperative.\nOverall, our study demonstrated that the EPHA1 (rs11771145) genetic variant is involved in the structural and functional modification of hippocampus and lateral occipitotemporal and inferior temporal gyri throughout the AD physiopathological process, and decreases the risk of AD by inhibiting the AD-related pathologic formation. However, several limitations precluded the explanation of these findings, and it is necessary to explore the effect of EPHA1 on AD in a larger sample, with longer follow-up and other ethnicities.\nThe Canadian Institutes of Health Research is providing funds to support ADNI clinical sites in Canada.
