[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third virus that caused coronavirus-related outbreaks over the past 20 years. The first outbreak occurred in Asia in 2002 Asia in -2003 causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), hence, the name, SARS-CoV, which back then was not related to any of the known viruses (Marra et al. 2003; Rota et al. 2003) . Between 2002 and 2003, 8,098 people became sick with SARS, and of those 774 died (i.e., a mortality rate of 9.5%). Since 2004, there have been no more reports of SARS cases (via NHS , WHO , and CDC ).\nThe second coronavirus-related outbreak started in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012 (Zaki et al. 2012 ) causing a more fetal disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), with a significantly higher mortality rate of 40% of the cases infected by MERS-CoV virus (Zumla, Hui, and Perlman 2015) .\n2 .

In addition to the respiratory complications in COVID-19 patients, clinical characterizations of severe infection cases indicated further comorbidities, including multiple organ failure (liver, kidney, and heart) and septic shock (Poston, Patel, and Davis 2020; Cascella et al. 2020; Hui Li et al. 2020) .\nThe genome sequence of SARS-COV-2 has been determined and made public , and since then thousands (more than 17,000) of genomes have been sequenced from all around the world (Shu and McCauley 2017) . The availability of those genomic sequences allows the rapid screening of viral RNA in human tissues as well as environmental samples (e.g., sewage (Bibby and Peccia 2013) ) using multi-omic wet lab technologies, as well as in silico screening tools, for publicly available metatranscriptomic samples.\nIn an attempt to elucidate COVID-19 pathogenesis in different human organs, we conducted this study to interrogate the presence of the virus in the blood, or any of its components, which might provide a form of trafficking or hiding to the virus, notably that some precarious studies reported the ability of the virus to infect lymphocytes (X. Wang et al. 2020) whereas others went as far as to suggest the virus exerts its pathogenesis through \"attacking hemoglobin,\" although this hypothesis has been heavily criticized (Read 2020) . Moreover, the virus was reported to be found in the plasma of COVID-19 patients (Huang et al. 2020 ) . Finally, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were shown to harbor other infectious viruses, such as HIV, HCV, and HBV (W.-K. Wang et al. 2002; Z. Li, Hou, and Cao 2015) .\nFor the aforementioned reasons, we computationally analyzed high-throughput sequence data from patients with active COVID-19 infection, and found evidence of traces of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their PMBCs, while their bronchoalveolar lavage samples had large amounts of the viral RNA.\n3 .

Based on the global gene expression in PBMC, PCA showed a strong, expected separation between BALF and PBMC samples, and further slight separation in the PBMC from healthy controls and COVID-19 patients ( Figure 1 ). However, one healthy control was placed within the COVID-19 cluster.\n5 .

Expectedly, no SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the PBMC from healthy controls (3 donors).\nThese RNA traces are certainly quite rare; however, they confidently and specifically belong to SARS-COV-2. One viral RNA read translates into polyprotein (pp1ab, accession NP_828849 ), which is the largest protein of coronaviruses and involved in the replication and transcription of the viral genome. The other viral RNA translates into surface (spike) glycoprotein (accession YP_009724390 ), which mediates the entry of the viral into the human cells expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) (Ou et al. 2020; Walls et al. 2020 ) .\nAlthough we are not rejecting the possibility of cross-contamination or barcode bleeding (Mitra et al. 2015; Kircher, Sawyer, and Meyer 2012) for detecting the viral RNA in one PBMC RNA-Seq sample, such possibility is unlikely, given that control samples had zero hits to SARS-CoV-2 RNA. We are also considering the possibility of SAR-CoV-2 being sampled by antigen-presenting cells (most likely dendritic cells) or presented to T lymphocytes, which are in the PBMC population.\nOne more possibility, which we believe needs many more samples to consider, is that SARS-CoV-2 may be specifically or coincidentally internalized by one of the mononuclear cell types, which may suggest a mechanism for the chronicity of the SAR-CoV-2 infection. This hypothesis requires further testing. However, in the light of our data, it is hard to support the early reports that SARS-COV-2 targets T-lymphocytes in vivo , as suggested earlier, in a correspondence, based on cell culture experiment with pseudotyped viruses (X. Wang et al. 2020 ) .\nWith more data becoming publicly available, it will be possible to revisit this hypothesis and others to improve our understanding of the progression and replication of SAR-CoV-2 in infected individuals."}, {"section_title": "Comparison of RNA Abundance and Gene Expression Profiles", "text": "Filtered FASTQ sequences were aligned to the SAR-CoV-2 reference genome (GenBank accession NC_045512 ) using BWA (Heng Li and Durbin 2009) .

In their report, they preferred to use the term \"RNAaemia,\" rather than \"viraemia,\" which they defined as the presence of a virus in the blood because they did not perform tests to confirm the presence of an infectious SAR-CoV-2 virus in the blood of the patients.\nOn the other hand, there have been no reports of detecting viral RNA in blood cells, notably PBMC. On the contrary, in their preliminary analysis of RNA isolated from PBMC, Corley et al confirmed that they did not detect viral sequences (currently, a preprint 10.1101/2020.04.13.039263v1 ).\nUsing high-throughput sequencing has been repeatedly demonstrated to be an effective approach for the identification and quantification of viruses in the blood (Moustafa et al. 2017) following similar methods as those used in viral metagenomics and uncultivated viral genomics Breitbart 2003 (Breitbart et al. 2003 , Aziz et al (Aziz et al. 2015) and Roux et al (Breitbart et al. 2003) .\nTherefore, we planned to exhaustively look for SAR-CoV-2 RNA sequences in publicly available RNA-Seq PBMC datasets. As of the writing of this report, there has been only one publicly available RNA-Seq PBMC dataset published by (Xiong et al. 2020) , in which the group profiled global gene expression in BALF and PBMC specimens of COVID-19. Predictably, we detected viral RNA in all BALF samples (2 patients, 2 replicates each) with an average abundance of 2.15% of the total RNA in those samples, which included human RNA. However, we identified two paired-end reads in RNA isolated from PBMC from only one (accession 9 .
