All included participants had available plasma total tau levels, A\u03b2 positron emission tomography imaging, and a complete neuropsychological examine at the same visit, as well as at least 1 follow-up visit.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Risk of MCI and dementia; global and domain-specific cognitive decline.\nOf the 458 participants, 287 (62.7%) were men; mean (SD) age was 80.6 (5.6) years. Among cognitively normal (CN) participants oversampled for elevated brain A\u03b2, both the middle (hazard ratio [HR], 2.43; 95% CI, 1.25-4.72) and highest (HR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.01-4.06) tertiles of plasma total tau level, compared with the lowest, were associated with an increased risk of MCI. Among participants with MCI, higher plasma total tau levels were not significantly associated with risk of dementia (all-cause dementia or Alzheimer disease). Among all participants, higher levels of plasma total tau, examined as a continuous variable, were associated with significant (P < .05) declines in global cognition, memory, attention, and visuospatial ability over a median follow-up of 3.0 years (range, 1.1-4.9 years). In additional analyses restricting the follow-up to 15 months, plasma total tau did not predict decline among CN participants. However, among participants with MCI, higher plasma total tau levels were associated with greater decline in both visuospatial ability (regression coefficient CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results suggest that elevated plasma total tau levels are associated with cognitive decline, but the results differ based on cognitive status and the duration of follow-up.

Cross-sectionally, some studies have reported elevated plasma total tau levels among participants with Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but other studies have not found a difference. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Few studies have examined whether plasma total tau level could be used as a prognostic marker or risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia. One recent study using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data reported that elevated plasma total tau levels were associated with greater cognitive decline and a larger increase in ventricular volume over 4 years among MCI and AD participants. 6 We sought to build on these findings by examining the association between plasma total tau level, cognitive decline, and risk of MCI and dementia in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA). Considering the ongoing secondary prevention amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) trials, we also examined whether there was an interaction between elevated brain A\u03b2 and plasma total tau levels for rate of cognitive decline and progression to MCI.

Since 2004, the population has been re-enumerated several times and extended to cover the ages of 50 to 90 years or older following the same sampling strategy. Residents randomly chosen for recruitment were invited to participate in the MCSA, and those without a medical contraindication (eg, pacemaker) were invited to participate in imaging studies. The present analyses included 458 participants aged 56 to 95 years with plasma total tau measures, A\u03b2 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, and cognitive testing at the same study visit and at least 1 follow-up visit with cognitive testing.

Participants with scores approximately 1.5 SDs below the age-specific mean in the general population were considered for possible cognitive impairment. A final decision was made after considering educational level, occupation, visual or hearing deficits, and reviewing all other participant information. The diagnosis of MCI was made by a consensus agreement between the study coordinator, examining physician, and neuropsychologist using published criteria. 17 Participants with MCI were classified as having amnestic MCI (aMCI) if the memory domain was impaired.

This finding is not surprising given that cerebrospinal fluid total tau levels appear to reflect the intensity of neuronal degeneration in AD at a specific point in time, and thus is less specific for AD, while phospho-tau appears to be more specific to AD-type tau pathology. 25 Future longitudinal studies will need to assess the association between plasma total tau level and other brain changes and pathologies.

We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to determine whether the baseline plasma total tau level, as a continuous variable and in tertiles, was associated with risk of MCI among CN participants and risk of dementia (both allcause and AD) among participants with MCI. All participants were censored at their last follow-up visit, diagnosis of MCI or dementia (depending on analyses), or death. Age was used as the time scale. Multivariable models were adjusted for sex, educational level, and APOE \u03b54. We also examined other variables previously associated with plasma total tau level (eg, diabetes, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, and statin use) 5 as potential confounders. Adjusting for these additional variables did not affect the strength of any of the associations; they were therefore not included. Lastly, we adjusted for elevated brain A\u03b2 to determine whether it was a potential confounder. We also examined whether there was an interaction between brain A\u03b2 and plasma total tau levels for predicting risk of MCI and dementia. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed for each outcome.\nWe used linear mixed-effects models, with an unstructured correlation matrix and random intercepts and slopes, to examine the association between baseline plasma total tau levels and change in global and domain-specific cognition. The models included baseline plasma total tau level (indicating the association between baseline plasma total tau level and baseline cognitive z score), time (indicating annual change in the cognitive z score), and the interaction between plasma total tau level and time (indicating whether baseline plasma total tau level predicted change in the cognitive z score). Change score analyses were used to examine the association between baseline plasma total tau level and 15-month change in each global and domain-specific z score to simulate the timeline of a clinical trial. Multivariable models were adjusted for age, sex, educational level, and APOE \u03b54 status. We again examined elevated brain A\u03b2 as a potential confounder and/or effect modifier.\nFor all analyses, we extensively examined the data, including plotting the associations between plasma total tau level and the slopes, assessing for influential outliers, assessing model assumptions, and examining marginal and conditional residuals. There was no evidence of influential outliers and no concerns after assessing the marginal and conditional residuals. Linear mixed-effect and Cox proportional hazards regression model analyses were completed using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were created using the survival package in R, version 3.3.1 (R Foundation). An unpaired, 2-tailed, P < .05 level was considered statistically significant. Figure 1A . In additional analyses, we did not observe an interaction between plasma total tau level as a continuous measure or in tertiles and elevated A\u03b2 level for risk of MCI. Forty-eight of the 67 (71.6%) incident MCI cases were aMCI. In sensitivity analyses, we repeated the analyses using aMCI as the outcome. In multivariable models, each log-unit increase in plasma total tau level was associated with an increased risk of aMCI, but the results were not significant (HR, 1.63; 95% CI, 0.69-3.88). Compared with the lowest tertile of plasma total tau level, both the middle (HR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.12-5.13) and highest (HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 0.85-4.37) tertiles were associated with an increased risk of aMCI. Adjusting for elevated brain A\u03b2 did not further attenuate this association, and there was not an interaction between plasma total tau level and A\u03b2 for predicting risk of aMCI.\nOf the 123 individuals with MCI at baseline, 28 (22.8%) progressed to dementia (20 attributed to AD). There were no associations between plasma total tau level as a continuous variable or in tertiles and risk of either all-cause dementia (multivariable analysis with plasma total tau level as a continuous variable: HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 0.57-5.07) or AD (multivariable analysis with plasma total tau level as a continuous variable: HR, 1.78; 95% CI, 0.61-5.19).

Elevated brain A\u03b2 was not a confounder or effect modifier.\nGiven the strong associations with age and both plasma total tau level and our outcomes, we used age as the time scale in the Kaplan-Meier plots and for the Cox proportional hazard hazards regression models.

Higher levels of plasma total tau were associated with an increased risk of MCI and with global-and domain-specific cognitive decline. Simulating a short 15-month trial, higher plasma total tau levels were associated only with declines in global cognition and visuospatial abilities among participants with MCI. In all analyses, the association between plasma total tau levels and all outcomes was independent of elevated brain A\u03b2.\nThe search for a blood-based biomarker with utility for AD has been confounded by many studies showing initial interesting findings but very little replication. 24 The results of previous studies across 4 cohorts and 2 independent laboratories examining the diagnostic utility of plasma total tau level for MCI or AD using the Simoa HD-1 hTau assay have been consistent. In all studies, participants with MCI or AD had higher plasma total tau levels compared with CN participants. However, there was considerable overlap between groups and no significant differences between CN individuals and those with MCI. 1, 5, 6 Thus, the plasma total tau level has limited utility as a diagnostic marker. Two studies examined the use of the plasma total tau level as a prognostic marker for cognitive decline and dementia. In the first study of patients with MCI, there was no significant difference in plasma total tau levels between those who progressed to AD dementia and those who remained as MCI and did not convert to dementia over a mean follow-up of 8 years. 1 In contrast, a recent study using ADNI data reported that elevated plasma total tau levels were associated with greater declines in measures of global cognition over 4 years. 6 There was a significant interaction between plasma total tau levels and diagnostic group such that the plasma total tau level was only associated with accelerated cognitive decline among participants with aMCI and AD dementia but not CN participants.\nIn the present study, higher plasma total tau levels were associated with an increased risk of MCI. There was also an increased risk of dementia, but the results were not significant. It is likely that our power was limited since we only had 20 cases of MCI that progressed to AD. Indeed, when we examined cognitive decline, higher plasma total tau levels were associated with global and domain-specific cognitive decline among both CN participants and those with MCI.\nIn contrast to the ADNI results, the only group interaction that we found was for visuospatial ability such that the plasma total tau level was only associated with decline among participants with MCI. It is possible that this association was spurious. However, when we restricted the follow-up time to 15 months to simulate a short clinical trial, elevated plasma total tau levels were specifically associated with declines in global cognition and visuospatial ability among participants with MCI but not among CN individuals. These results may suggest that plasma total tau levels could help to identify participants in whom MCI will progress fastest. The 2 previous studies did not examine plasma total tau levels and short-term cognitive changes, so our proposed explanation is only a hypothesis, and additional studies are needed to confirm this observation.\nAlthough the present MCSA results are similar to the ADNI results, there are a few methodologic differences that could account for some of the discrepancies described above. First, ADNI enrolls participants with aMCI, while the MCSA includes all participants with MCI. Restricting some of our analyses to individuals with aMCI, however, did not alter the results. Second, the only MCSA enrollment exclusionary criterion is a terminal illness. ADNI has some restrictions regarding vascular and other diseases.

There are also limitations. First, the plasma sample set was used for 2 separate studies to conserve samples and, thus, underwent at least 1 freeze-thaw cycle before analysis. Second, the study did not include participants with AD dementia. As a result, we were not able to determine whether the plasma total tau level was associated with cognitive decline among individuals with AD or other dementia types. Lastly, we did not adjust for other brain pathologies that could attenuate the association. Future research is needed to discern the association between other brain abnormalities, including brain tau deposition measured via tau-PET, on plasma total tau levels."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Plasma total tau level may be a useful prognostic risk factor or biomarker for cognitive decline, but is not an AD-specific biomarker. Given some of the discrepancies between the 3 studies examining plasma total tau levels and longitudinal cognitive changes, we cannot currently suggest that patients be stratified or selected on plasma total tau levels. Additional studies using other samples and specifically testing short vs long follow-up are needed before this question can be answered. Longitudinal studies examining serial measures of plasma total tau levels, across both the AD cognitive spectrum and in other neurodegenerative diseases, are also needed to determine how to best utilize plasma total tau level as a risk factor or biomarker for cognitive decline.
