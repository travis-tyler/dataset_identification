Intellectual Property Organization\n\n\fAbout Science and Engineering Indicators\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators (SEI) is first and foremost a volume of record comprising the major high-quality quantitative data on the U.S. and international science and engineering enterprise. SEI is factual and policy-neutral. It does not offer policy options and it does not make policy recommendations. SEI employs a variety of presentational styles-- tables, figures, narrative text, bulleted text, Web-based links, highlights, introductions, conclusions, reference lists--to make the data accessible to readers with different information needs and different information-processing preferences.\nThe data are \"indicators.\" Indicators are quantitative representations that might reasonably be thought to provide summary information bearing on the scope, quality, and vitality of the science and engineering enterprise. The indicators reported in SEI are intended to contribute to an understanding of the current environment and to inform the development of future policies. SEI does not model the dynamics of the science and engineering enterprise, and it avoids strong claims about the significance of the indicators it reports. SEI is used by readers who hold a variety of views about which indicators are most significant for different purposes.\nSEI is prepared by the National Science Foundation's Division of Science Resources Statistics (SRS) under the guidance of the National Science Board (Board). It is subject to extensive review by outside experts, interested federal agencies, Board members, and NSF internal reviewers for accuracy, coverage, and balance.\nSEI includes more information about measurement than many readers unaccustomed to analyzing social and economic data may find easy to absorb. This information is included because readers need a good understanding of what the reported measures mean and how the data were collected in order to use the data appropriately. SEI's data analyses, however, are relatively accessible. The data can be examined in various ways, and SEI generally emphasizes neutral, factual description and avoids unconventional or controversial analysis. As a result, SEI almost exclusively uses simple statistical tools that should be familiar and accessible to a college-bound high school graduate. Readers comfortable with numbers and percentages and equipped with a general conceptual understanding of terms such as \"statistical significance\" and \"margin of error\" will readily understand the statistical material in SEI. A separate Statistical Appendix was added to SEI this year to aid readers' interpretation of the material presented.\nSEI's Different Parts\nSEI includes seven chapters that follow a generally consistent pattern; an eighth chapter, on state indicators, presented in a unique format; and an overview that precedes these eight chapters.

In addition, the Board for the first time has also produced a \"digest\" or condensed version of SEI comprising a small selection of important indicators. This Digest of Key Science and Engineering Indicators serves two purposes: (1) to draw attention to important trends and data points from across the chapters and volumes of SEI and (2) to introduce readers to the data resources available in the main volumes of SEI 2008 and associated products.\nThe Seven Core Chapters\nEach chapter consists of front matter (table of contents and lists of sidebars, text tables, and figures), highlights, an introduction (chapter overview and chapter organization), a narrative synthesis of data and related contextual information, a conclusion, notes, a glossary, and references.\nHighlights. The highlights provide an outline of major dimensions of a chapter topic. They are intended to be suitable as the basis for a presentation that would capture the essential facts about a chapter topic. As such, they are prepared for a knowledgeable generalist who seeks an organized generic presentation on a topic and does not wish to develop a distinctive perspective on the topic, though s/he may wish to flavor a standard presentation with some distinctive insights. They also provide a brief version of the \"meat\" of the chapter.\nIntroduction. The chapter overview provides a brief explanation of why the topic of the chapter is important. It situates the topic in the context of major concepts, terms, and developments relevant to the data that the chapter reports. The\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n xiii\n\nintroduction includes a brief narrative account of the logical flow of topics within the chapter.\nNarrative. The chapter narrative is a descriptive synthesis that brings together significant findings. It is also a balanced presentation of contextual information that is useful for interpreting the findings. As a descriptive synthesis, the narrative aims (1) to enable the reader to comfortably assimilate a large amount of information by putting it in an order that facilitates comprehension and retention and (2) to order the material so that major points readily come to the reader's attention. As a balanced presentation, the narrative aims to include appropriate caveats and context information such that (3) a nonexpert reader will understand what uses of the data may or may not be appropriate, and (4) an expert reader will be satisfied that the presentation reflects a good understanding of the policy and fact context in which the data are interpreted by users with a range of science policy views.\nFigures. Figures provide visually compelling representations of major findings discussed in the text. Figures also enable readers to test narrative interpretations offered in the text by examining the data themselves.\nText Tables. Text tables help to illustrate points made in the text.\nSidebars. Sidebars discuss interesting recent developments in the field, more speculative information than is presented in the regular chapter text, or other special topics. Sidebars can also present definitions or highlight crosscutting themes.\nAppendix Tables. Appendix tables, which appear in volume 2 of SEI, provide the most complete presentation of quantitative data, without contextual information or interpretive aids. According to past surveys of SEI users, even experienced expert readers find it helpful to consult the chapter text in conjunction with the appendix tables.\nConclusion. The conclusion summarizes important findings. It offers a perspective on important trends but stops short of definitive pronouncements about either likely futures or policy implications. Conclusions tend to avoid factual syntheses that suggest a distinctive or controversial viewpoint.\nReferences. SEI includes references to data sources cited in the text, stressing national or internationally comparable data. SEI does not review the analytic literature on a topic or summarize the social science or policy perspectives that might be brought to bear on it. References to that literature are included only where they are necessary to explain the basis for statements in the text.\nThe State Indicators Chapter\nThis chapter consists of data that can be used by people involved in state-level policymaking, including journalists and interested citizens, to assess trends in S&T-related ac-\n\ntivities in their states. Indicators are drawn from a range of variables, most of which are part of the subject matter of the seven core chapters. The text explains the meaning of each indicator and provides important caveats about how to interpret it. Approximately 3 to 5 bullets highlight significant findings. The presentation is overwhelmingly graphic and tabular. It is dominated by a United States map that color codes states into quartiles and a table with state by state data. In 2008, appendix tables are also included in volume 2 for the first time.\nThere is no interpretive narrative to synthesize overall patterns and trends. SEI includes state-level indicators to call attention to state performance in S&T and to foster consideration of state-level activities in this area.\nThe Overview Chapter\nThe Overview is a selective interpretive synthesis that brings together patterns and trends that unite data in several of the substantive chapters. The Overview helps readers to synthesize the findings in SEI as a whole and draws connections among separately prepared chapters that deal with related topics. It is intended to serve readers with varying levels of expertise. Because the Overview relies heavily on figures, it is well adapted for use in developing presentations, and presentation graphics for the figures in the Overview are available on the Web. Like the core chapters, the Overview strives for a descriptive synthesis and a balanced tone, and it does not take or suggest policy positions.\nPresentation\nSEI is released in printed and electronic formats, and is published in 2 volumes: volume 1 provides the main text content and volume 2 provides the detailed tabular data. The complete content of both volumes is posted online at http:// www.nsf.gov/statistics/indicators/ in html format and PDF, with text tables, appendix tables, and source data for each figure available in spreadsheet (MS Excel) format. In addition, selected figures are also available in presentation-style format as MS PowerPoint and JPEG files.\nThe printed version of SEI includes a CD-ROM in PDF and a packaged set of information cards. The CD-ROM contains volumes 1 and 2, and as with the online version, appendix tables in spreadsheet format. The full set of presentation slides is also included. The pocket-sized information cards highlight key patterns and trends. Each card presents a selection of figures with captions stating the major point that the figure is meant to illustrate.\nSEI includes a list of abbreviations/acronyms and an index.\n\n\f\fOverview\nIntroduction .................................................................................................................................

It synthesizes selected major findings in a meaningful way and is not intended to be comprehensive. The reader will find important findings in the report that are not covered in the overview, for example, public support for science is strong even though public knowledge is limited, S&T activities in different states vary substantially in size and scope, and participation of underrepresented groups in U.S. S&T is growing, but slowly. More extensive data are presented in the body of each chapter, and major findings on particular topics appear in the Highlights sections that precede chapters 1\u00ad7.\nThe reader should note that the indicators included in Science and Engineering Indicators 2008 derive from a variety of national, international, and private sources and may not be strictly comparable in a statistical sense, especially for international data. In addition, some metrics and data are somewhat weak, and models relating them to each other and to economic and social outcomes are often not well developed. Thus, even though many data series conform generally to international standards, the focus is on broad trends that should be interpreted with care; where data are weak, this is noted in the specific chapter. (For more on the limitations of existing data and analytic models, see \"Afterword: Data Gaps and Needs.\")\nThe overview highlights a trend in many parts of the world toward the development of more knowledge-intensive economies, in which research, its commercial exploitation, and other intellectual work play a growing role. Implicit in the discussion are the key roles played by industry and government in these changes.\nA healthy economy provides the foundation for investments in scientific research and technological innovation. Therefore, the overview begins by describing broad trends in U.S. competitiveness in the rapidly changing global macroeconomic system. It then traces the growth and structural shifts in international high-technology markets and comments briefly on related developments in medium- and lowtechnology market segments. There follows an examination of the changing conduct and location of international R&D, which are both fundamental to, and recasting, international high-technology markets.\nThe overview then turns to the personnel needed to build and maintain knowledge-intensive economic activity. After reviewing evidence of the widespread upgrading of higher education levels in international workforces, the discussion turns to a review of the U.S. S&T labor force, including trends in the production of new workers with S&T skills. It presents data on the U.S. reliance on foreign-born and foreign-educated S&T workers and discusses the growing international mobility of highly trained persons. The overview concludes with a review of the performance of U.S. K\u00ad12 students on national and international tests.\n\nThroughout, the overview examines relevant S&T patterns and trends in the United States that bear on, and are affected by, these external changes. Where possible, the overview presents comparative data for the United States, the European Union after its first major enlargement (EU25), and Japan, China, and eight other selected Asian economies (the Asia-10).\nMacroeconomic Indicators\nSince the early 1990s, the globalization of S&T has proceeded at a quick pace. More open borders coincided with the development of the Internet as a tool for unfettered worldwide information dissemination and communication. Rising demand for business and leisure travel fostered the growth of dense and relatively inexpensive airline links. Systems of global and more limited trade rules gained in scope and stimulated a vast expansion in the production of, and international trade in, goods and services. Growing creation of wealth, though uneven, touched most countries and regions. Corporations responded by including international markets in their strategic planning and soon moved toward a global-market model for their business activities, suppliers, and customers.\nBy the late 1990s, many governments had taken note of these developments. They increasingly looked to the development of knowledge-intensive economies for their countries' economic competitiveness and growth. Private companies seeking new markets set up operations in or near these locations, bringing with them technological know-how and management expertise. Governments anticipated and stimulated these moves with targeted and often generous incentives, decreased regulatory barriers, development of infrastructure, and expanded access to higher education. The overarching aim of these policies was the development of a knowledge-intensive economy that promised sustainable growth and economic well-being for decades to come.\nIn this changed and changing world, the United States continues to occupy a prominent position as the world's largest economy. On a number of broad macroeconomic measures, it has performed well over the past two decades. Its gross domestic product (GDP) growth has been robust, both overall and on a per capita basis, and its productivity growth has been strong.\nU.S. GDP growth is robust but cannot match large, sustained increases in China and other Asian economies.\nWorld Bank and other data show that the world's total economic output nearly doubled over the past two decades.1 Although most world regions participated in this rapid expansion of total economic output, increases did not occur evenly. A group of East and Southeast Asian economies (the Asia-10) gained more rapidly than did most of the rest of the world, initiating a slow shift of the epicenter of world economic growth toward the region (figure O-1). Its GDP nearly tripled as China, India, and South Korea posted strong\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n O-5\n\nFigure O-1 Real GDP growth, by region/country: 1985\u00ad95 and 1995\u00ad2005\n\nPercent\n\n100\n\n1985\u00ad95\n\n1995\u00ad2005\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0 World\n-20\n\nUnited States\n\nEuropean Union\n\nAsia-10\n\nLatin America/ Canada\n\nMiddle East\n\nAfrica\n\nAll others\n\nGDP = gross domestic product NOTES: Asia-10 includes China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand.

The rapid rise in Asian economic output over two decades, combined with slower growth elsewhere, pushed the region's share of world GDP from less than one-quarter in 1985 to 36% in 2005 (figure O-2).\nU.S. real GDP growth was slower than Asia's but faster than that of most other mature economies. It resulted in a near-doubling of real output over the two decades, leading to a small decline in the U.S. share of world GDP, from about 22% to just above 20% in 2005 (figure O-2). The EU-25 faced slower growth and a larger share decline from 24% to 19%. Japan's economy continued to grow in real terms but at a declining rate, leading to a fall of the country's world GDP share starting in the early 1990s, from about 8% of the total to 6% by 2005. The \"all others\" category in figure O-2 largely reflects the breakdown in growth of Eastern European and Asiatic countries of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).\nEven as others gain in per capita GDP, the absolute U.S. advantage widens because of its advantageous starting position.\nGDP growth in part reflects increases in population, and GDP per person provides a convenient means of adjusting for this factor, albeit a measure that does not take in-country distribution into account.2 A comparison of GDP and population growth rates shows a highly variable relationship for different regions and countries: very strong GDP growth for Asia, even after accounting for rising populations; average growth for the United States and the EU-25; and below-average growth for some other regions with fairly large population growth (figure O-3).\nOver the past two decades (1985\u00ad2005), real annual growth of U.S. per capita GDP averaged 2.0%, almost iden-\n\ntical to the world average and the growth rate of the EU-25.

So did virtually all East and Southeast Asian economies, regardless of size. The highest growth rate of real per capita GDP3 was achieved by China, averaging 6.6% over the period, followed by South Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, and others; India's GDP per capita rose by 4.2%. Of 11 economies with at least twice the U.S. average per capita growth, nine were in Asia (table O-1).\nIn terms of absolute per capita purchasing power, the United States has for decades led other regions by wide margins, the closest being the EU-25.4 All regions but Africa\n\nTable O-1 Real per capita GDP growth rates, by selected region/country/economy: 1985\u00ad2005\n(Percent)\n\nEconomy\n\n1985\u00ad95 1995\u00ad2005 1985\u00ad2005\n\nWorld .......................\n\n1.4\n\n2.3\n\n1.9\n\nUnited States .......\n\n1.7\n\n2.2\n\n2.0\n\nChina ....................\n\n6.4\n\n6.8\n\n6.6\n\nSouth Korea .........\n\n7.8\n\n3.7\n\n5.7\n\nIreland ..................\n\n4.5\n\n6.6\n\n5.5\n\nVietnam ................\n\n4.1\n\n5.9\n\n5.0\n\nThailand ...............\n\n8.0\n\n1.8\n\n4.9\n\nMyanmar ..............\n\n0.4\n\n9.4\n\n4.8\n\nTaiwan ..................\n\n5.1\n\n3.7\n\n4.4\n\nChile .....................\n\n5.5\n\n3.0\n\n4.3\n\nSingapore .............\n\n5.7\n\n2.8\n\n4.2\n\nIndia .....................\n\n3.6\n\n4.7\n\n4.2\n\nMalaysia ...............\n\n5.6\n\n2.6\n\n4.1\n\nGDP = gross domestic product\n\nSOURCE: Conference Board and Groningen Growth and Development Centre, Total Economy Database, January 2007, http:// www.ggdc.net.\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nand the former USSR-dominated category have shown twodecade increases, and the Asia-10 grouping has doubled its per capita GDP in real terms (figure O-4).\n\nFigure O-4 Per capita GDP, by region/country: 1985\u00ad2005\n\nConstant 1990 PPP dollars (thousands)\n\n40 World\n\nU.S.\n\n35\n\nEU\n\nAsia-10\n\n30\n\nLatin America/Canada\n\nMiddle East\n\nAfrica\n\n25\n\nAll others\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005\nEU = European Union; GDP = gross domestic product; PPP = purchasing power parity\nNOTES: Asia-10 includes China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand.

The absolute gap in 2005 was smallest for the EU-25 (about $12,000) and largest for Africa (about $29,000). The Asia-10 gap increased from about $18,000 to $26,000, despite the region's rapid GDP growth. Since 1985, this gap has increased for each region (figure O-5).\nFor some regions, the per capita GDP gap also increased as a fraction of their own growing per capita GDP. The only region to consistently reduce the relative per capita GDP gap with the United States was the Asia-10 (figure O-6). The Asia-10 group managed to reduce the size of the gap from 8 times its per capita GDP to under 5 times, reflecting impressive underlying GDP growth numbers coupled with moderate (1.4%) population growth (figure O-3).\nLarge relative productivity gains elsewhere fail to close absolute per-worker output gaps with the United States.\nRising productivity spurs economic growth and higher per capita resources. The preferred measure, volume of economic output per hour worked, is available for only a few countries. It shows that after enduring anemic productivity growth into the mid-1990s, the United States recovered to\n\nFigure O-5 Per capita GDP gap with United States, by region: 1985\u00ad2005\n\nConstant 1990 PPP dollars (thousands)\n\n40\n\nWorld\n\n35\n\nEU Asia-10\n\nLatin America/Canada\n\n30\n\nMiddle East\n\nAfrica\n\nAll others 25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005\nEU = European Union; GDP = gross domestic product; PPP = purchasing power parity\nNOTES: Asia-10 includes China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand.

That measure shows generally higher real productivity gains for the regional aggregates in the 1995\u00ad2005 decade than in the preceding one, except for the EU-25 (figure O-7). Neither the United States, nor major European countries or Japan achieved the kind of productivity growth rates of some Asian economies. These averaged above 3% during the first decade and approached 4% during the second. China and India had real second-decade productivity growth rates of 6.6% and 4.4%, respectively, albeit from low bases.\nIn inflation-adjusted dollars, U.S. output per worker increased more steeply over the 20-year period than that of any other economy. Again, this reflects the much higher U.S. output per worker at the beginning of the period: a 2% increase on a high base is much larger, in absolute terms, than the same percentage rise on a small base. As a result, even countries with fast-expanding economies faced a growing gap with the United States (figure O-8). Even the EU-25, with a 20-year average productivity growth rate that matched that of the United States, saw its productivity gap widening after 1995.\nFigure O-6 Per capita GDP gap with United States relative to region's GDP: 1985\u00ad2005\nRatio 20\n\n15\n\nWorld\n\nEU\n\nAsia-10\n\nLatin America/Canada\n\n10\n\nMiddle East\n\nAfrica\n\nAll others\n\n5\n\n0 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005\nEU = European Union; GDP = gross domestic product NOTES: Asia-10 includes China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand.

Its absolute GDP growth was sufficiently robust to broadly maintain the U.S. world share in the face of expanding world GDP and a shift of rapid GDP growth toward Asian economies. Similarly, it has maintained its advantages in both purchasing power and productivity. While per capita GDP of economies in Asia and elsewhere was rising at very rapid rates, smaller rates of increase in U.S. per capita GDP kept widening the absolute dollar gap, reflecting and continuing the large initial U.S. advantage. U.S. productivity growth was sufficiently robust to keep the country well ahead, in absolute productivity measures, even as others raise their productivity growth rates from relatively low levels.\nKnowledge-Intensive Economies\nThe notion of a knowledge-intensive economy is of relatively recent vintage but has taken a powerful hold on governments in many parts of the world. It is easy to see why. Industries that rely heavily on the application and exploitation of knowledge are driving growth in both manufacturing and services. They tend to create well-paying jobs, to con-\n\ntribute high-value output, and to stimulate economic activity generally. The global nature of these developments compels governments to take part in them or be left behind, to the detriment of a country's economic standing and well-being.\nIndustry anticipates and reacts to these same fundamentals. Growing markets, including rapidly expanding ones in Asia, beckon, especially for knowledge- and technologyintensive goods and services. They offer growing buying power, cheap labor, and often strategically structured government incentives intended to attract investment. Spurred by both market and government activities, these economies, and particularly their knowledge-intensive sectors, have grown very rapidly in a number of regions.\nIndicators of the shift toward knowledge-intensive economic activity abound. Around the world, service sectors are expanding, driven by rapid growth of their most knowledgeintensive segments. Goods from high-technology manufacturing segments represent a growing share of manufacturing output. Countries are investing heavily in expansion and quality improvement of their higher education systems, easing access to them, and often directing sizable portions of this investment to training in science, engineering, and related S&T fields. The concept of innovation figures prominently in discussions of economic policy.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n O-9\n\nTaken together, these activities have spawned trends that are reshaping the world's S&T economy, now dominated not only by the United States and the EU, but also by selected Southeast and South Asian economies. The broad changes, generally starting in the mid-1990s and continuing unabated, have the United States holding its own in terms of (generally high) world shares, the EU-25 losing some ground, and the Asia-10 group increasing its world share. In Asia, Japan is losing world share on many indicators, while China is rapidly gaining ground, especially since the mid-1990s.\nKnowledge-intensive industries are reshaping the world economy.\nKnowledge-intensive industries, both in services and manufacturing, form a growing share of economic output worldwide and in many individual countries. While the estimated volume of worldwide services doubled between 1985 and 2005, knowledge-intensive services grew faster. After the mid-1990s, their growth accelerated to approximately 3.5% annually in real terms, compared with about 2.5% for other types of services. A similar shift occurred in high-technology manufacturing, where output rose from about 12% of total manufacturing output to about 19% over two decades (figure O-9).\nThese developments affected various countries and regions differently, leading to considerable shifts in world\n\nshares, particularly in high-technology manufacturing. The Asia-10's share increased from 29% to 41% over two decades. However, within the group, Japan's share declined from 25% in 1985 to 16% in 2005, while China's share rose, with sharp acceleration starting in the mid-1990s, from under 2% to 16% over the same period (figure O-10). The EU's share of high-technology manufacturing declined from about 25% through the mid-1990s to 18% in 2005. In contrast, U.S. high-technology manufacturing expanded sharply over the past decade to 24% of all U.S. manufacturing activity by 2005, up from 12% as late as 1995; this has kept the U.S. world share above 30% since the late 1990s.\nTrade patterns in knowledge-intensive services and hightechnology manufacturing have changed.\nTrade volume in high-technology manufactures has risen about 10-fold over the two decades, with exports reaching approximately $2.3 trillion in 2005 (figure O-11). The arrival and rapid expansion of new, mostly Asian, manufacturing locations has shifted world export patterns, shrinking the shares of established manufacturing centers. The EU's world share fell from 39% to 28%, that of the United States from 23% to 12%, and Japan's from 21% to 9%. China's share increased dramatically after the late 1990s, reaching 20%, while the share of other Asian economies rose quite steadily from 7% to 25% in 2005 (figure O-12).\n\nFigure O-9 High-technology manufacturing share of total manufacturing, by region/country: 1985\u00ad2005\n\nPercent 30\n25\n20\n\nWorld U.S. EU Asia China Japan\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005\nEU = European Union\nNOTES: Asia includes India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand.

The strong U.S. economy boosted imports of high-technology goods, which rose to $291 billion in 2006 from $196 billion in 2000. However, U.S. exports of these types of goods failed to keep pace, and imports have exceeded exports since 2002, producing the first U.S. trade deficit in this segment of the U.S. economy (figure O-13).\nThe growing technological sophistication of Asian trade partners is evident in the growing imports of high-technology goods from Asia that are not balanced by U.S. exports to these economies. The overall high-technology goods deficit is driven by trade with Asia, while trade with Europe, North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) partners, and Latin America is broadly in balance (figure O-14).\nHowever, the United States continues to maintain a healthy position in royalties and fees for intellectual property. This includes both cross-border intrafirm transactions and transactions between unaffiliated firms; the latter accounted for approximately 25% of all such transactions over the past two decades (figure O-15).\n\nFigure O-12 World share of high-technology manufacturing exports, by region/country: 1985\u00ad2005\nPercent 40\nEU\n30\n\nU.S. 20\nJapan\nAsia 10\n\nChina\n\n0 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005\nEU = European Union NOTES: Asia includes India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand.

Some results of these efforts are difficult to measure, such as the quality of rising numbers of higher education degrees awarded, but others are eventually reflected in readily quantified data. Intellectual property rights in major markets in the form of patents are generally accepted as indicating a degree of technological innovativeness and sophistication. Publication of rising numbers of scientific and technical articles in international, peer-reviewed journals is evidence of growing scientific capacity, as are increasing international collaborations. A number of governments are actively encouraging these activities and monitoring these and related indicators.\nPatent applications to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) seek intellectual property protection in the world's largest national economy. Applications from foreign sources reveal growing technological capabilities around the world, as well as rising incentives to protect the exploitation of potentially economically valuable inventions. Such applications have more than tripled since 1985, with U.S. applications consistently accounting for 53% or more through 2005. Over the period, applications from EU countries little more than doubled, while those from Asia increased fivefold (figure O-16).\nThese divergent growth rates created large shifts in the country and regional shares of U.S. patent applications. The EU, long the major non-U.S. source, lost ground in the late 1980s to a nascent Asia, as the EU's share declined from 21% to 13% of total applications registered by the USPTO; Asia's share in the meantime rose from 19% to 29%. Within Asia, Japan's share fluctuated around 18% to, briefly, 22% while that of smaller Asian economies such as South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore rose from 1% to 9% (figure O-17). Chinese applications, however, do not yet register in any significant way, suggesting room for further development of the country's domestic technology base.\nProgress in building the S&E base underlying indigenous technical advances is registered in articles published in the international peer-reviewed literature. On this measure, the U.S. and Japanese outputs grew marginally over the 1995\u00ad 2005 decade, while Asia's output doubled (figure O-18). China moved to fifth place in total article output, and a number of other Asian economies, including South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, registered steep publications increases, suggesting improving basic scientific infrastructure. But a broad citation measure (citations received adjusted for the volume of articles available for citation) indicates a more measured pace of increasing article quality for many Asian locations.\n\n\fO-12 \n\nOverview\n\nFigure O-16 USPTO patent applications, by region/country: 1985\u00ad2005\nThousands 250\n200\n150\nU.S.\n100 Asia-10\nEU 50\nAll others\n0 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005\nEU = European Union; USPTO = U.S. Patent and Trademark Office NOTES: Country of origin based on residence of first-named inventor.

The level of R&D relative to other expenditures provides an indication of the priority given to advancing S&T relative to other public and private goals.\nA growing emphasis on R&D is a measure of the development of a knowledge-intensive economy. In government accounts, R&D must compete for funding with other programs supported by discretionary spending, from education to national defense. The budget share devoted to R&D thus indicates governmental and societal investment in R&D relative to other activities. Similarly, the amount for-profit companies spend on R&D relative to other investments indicates how important they consider technological improvements to be as a basis for developing markets and exploiting demand for better processes, goods, and services.\nR&D enables but does not guarantee invention, and invention does not automatically lead to innovation, the introduction of new goods, services, or business processes in the marketplace.

In the end, it is the results of R&D expenditures that matter, not their amount.\nInternationally, R&D is concentrated but becoming less so. Over the past two decades, R&D has principally been\nperformed and funded in North America, Europe, and Asia by the 30 developed member nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (figure O-19).5 The United States and Japan provided close to 60% of the estimated $772 billion OECD total in 2005, little changed from 61% of the $480 billion OECD total in 1995.\nBut this picture is changing (table O-2). For nearly a decade, R&D expenditures are estimated to have risen rapidly in selected Asian and Latin American economies and elsewhere. The average annual R&D growth rate of nine non-OECD economies (Argentina, China, Israel, Romania, Russian Federation, Singapore, Slovenia, South Africa, and Taiwan; there are no data for India) tracked by the OECD was about 15.5% from 1995 to 2005, compared with an OECD average of 5.8%. Over the decade, the OECD share of the combined total dropped from an estimated 92% to 82%. Likewise, the combined share of the United States and Japan, the two largest R&D-performing countries, declined from 56% of the total in 1995 to 48% in 2005.\nChina's expansion of R&D was by far the most rapid and sustained of all (figure O-20).

Other less-developed countries that appear set to become sizable R&D performers include Brazil ($14 billion in 2004) and India ($21 billion in 2000).\n\nIndustry R&D in manufacturing and services is expanding and increasingly crossing borders.\nIn most OECD countries, the manufacturing and services sectors account for more than 60% of total R&D funding and performance. However, sector concentration and sources of funding vary substantially among these countries.\nIndustrial R&D in the United States is highly diversified. No single U.S. industry accounted for more than 16% of total business R&D (table O-3 and figure O-21). The diversity of R&D investment by industry in the United States is also an indicator of how the nation's accumulated stock of knowledge and well-developed S&T infrastructure have made it a popular location for R&D performance in a broad range of industries.\nMost other countries display higher sector concentrations than the United States. In countries with less business R&D, high sector concentrations can result from the activities of one or two large companies. This pattern is notable in Finland, where the radio, television, and communications equipment industry accounted for almost half of business R&D in 2004. Other industries also exhibit relatively high concentrations of R&D by country. Automotive manufacturers rank among the largest R&D-performing companies in the world. Because of this, the countries that are home to the world's major automakers also boast the highest concentration of R&D in the motor vehicles industry. This industry accounts for 32% of Germany's business R&D, 26% of the Czech Republic's, and 19% of Sweden's.\nThe pharmaceuticals industry accounts for 20% or more of business R&D in Denmark, the United Kingdom, Belgium, and Sweden. Among OECD countries, only the Netherlands and Japan report double-digit concentration of business R&D in the office, accounting, and computing machine industry.\nOne of the more significant trends in both U.S. and international industrial R&D activity has been the growth of\n\nTable O-3 R&D expenditures for selected countries, by performing sector: Most recent year\n(Percent)\n\nCountry\n\nIndustry\n\nHigher education\n\nGovernment\n\nOther nonprofit\n\nSouth Korea (2005).........................................\n\n76.9\n\n9.9\n\n11.9\n\n1.4\n\nJapan (2004) ...................................................\n\n75.2\n\n13.4\n\n9.5\n\n1.9\n\nUnited States (2006) .......................................\n\n71.1\n\n13.7\n\n11.0\n\n4.2\n\nGermany (2005) ..............................................\n\n69.9\n\n16.5\n\n13.6\n\nNA\n\nChina (2005) ...................................................\n\n68.3\n\n9.9\n\n21.8\n\nNA\n\nRussian Federation (2005)..............................\n\n68.0\n\n5.8\n\n26.1\n\n0.2\n\nUnited Kingdom (2004)...................................\n\n63.0\n\n23.4\n\n10.3\n\n3.3\n\nFrance (2005)..................................................\n\n61.9\n\n19.5\n\n17.3\n\n1.2\n\nCanada (2006) ................................................\n\n52.4\n\n38.4\n\n8.8\n\n0.5\n\nItaly (2004) ......................................................\n\n47.8\n\n32.8\n\n17.9\n\n1.5\n\nNA = not available\n\nSOURCES: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, National Patterns of R&D Resources (annual series); and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Main Science and Technology Indicators (2006).\n\nScience & Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n O-15\n\nFigure O-21 Share of industrial R&D, by industry sector and selected region/country: 2003 or 2004\n(Percent)\n\nUnited States (2004) EU (2003)\nJapan (2003) Germany (2004)\nFrance (2003) South Korea (2004) United Kingdom (2004)\nCanada (2004) Italy (2004)\nSweden (2003) Spain (2004)\nNetherlands (2004) Australia (2003) Belgium (2004) Finland (2004) Denmark (2004) Norway (2004)\nCzech Republic (2004) Ireland (2004) Poland (2004)\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 0 10 20 30 40 50 0 10 20 30 40 50\n\nRadio, television, and communication equipment\n\nMotor vehicles\n\nPharmaceuticals\n\nUnited States (2004) EU (2003)\nJapan (2003) Germany (2004)\nFrance (2003) South Korea (2004) United Kingdom (2004)\nCanada (2004) Italy (2004)\nSweden (2003) Spain (2004)\nNetherlands (2004) Australia (2003) Belgium (2004) Finland (2004) Denmark (2004) Norway (2004)\nCzech Republic (2004) Ireland (2004) Poland (2004)\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 0 10 20 30 40 50 0 10 20 30 40 50\n\nInstruments, watches, and clocks\n\nOffice, accounting, and computing machinery\n\nAll services\n\nEU = European Union NOTE: Countries listed in descending order by amount of total industrial R&D.

See appendix table 4-42.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\fO-16 \n\nOverview\n\nR&D in the service sector. ICT services account for a substantial share of the service R&D totals.\nIn most OECD countries, government financing accounted for a small and declining share of total industrial R&D performance during the 1980s and 1990s (figure O-22). In 1981, government provided 21% of the funds used by industry in conducting R&D within OECD countries. By 2001, government's funding share of industrial R&D had fallen below 7% and continued to fluctuate between 6.8% and 7% through 2005. Among major industrial countries, government financing of industrial R&D performance shares ranged from as little as 1.2% in Japan to 54% in Russia in 2005. In the United States in 2006, the federal government provided about 9% of the R&D funds used by industry, and the majority of that funding came from Department of Defense contracts.\nAn indicator of the globalization of industrial R&D, the relative prominence of foreign sources of funding for business R&D, increased in many countries in the 1990s (figure O-23). The role of foreign funding varies by country, accounting for less than 1% of industrial R&D in Japan to as much as 23% in the United Kingdom in 2004. Directly comparable data on foreign funding sources of U.S. R&D performance are unavailable, but data on U.S. investments by foreign multinational corporations (MNCs) suggest this is rising as well. (See section on multinationals' R&D conducted abroad later in this overview.) This funding predominantly comes from foreign corporations; however, some of it also comes from foreign governments and other foreign organizations. For European countries, growth in foreign sources of industry R&D funds may reflect the expansion of coordinated EU efforts to foster cooperative shared-cost research through its European Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development.\nR&D/GDP ratio is an elusive policy goal but a useful indicator of R&D intensity.\nA country's ratio of R&D to GDP depends on many things, among them the extent and structure of industrialization, orientation toward R&D in various sectors of the economy, availability of trained personnel, the nature of R&D infrastructure, and government policy. This makes meeting any specific R&D/GDP ratio an elusive policy goal. However, R&D/GDP ratios do provide a quick view of the R&D intensity of an economy relative to support of other public and private goals. Thus, emphasis on R&D can be seen as a measure of a knowledge-intensive economy.\nExisting wealth generally bestows an advantage in moving toward a knowledge-intensive economy. R&D intensity indicators, such as R&D/GDP ratios, show that the developed, wealthy economies are well ahead of lesser developed economies. In many cases, this ratio heavily reflects the level of industry-funded R&D. Although industrial R&D does not generally respond directly to government policies, it thrives where favorable framework conditions exist, and these are subject to government influence.\n\nFigure O-22 OECD industry R&D, by funding sector: 1981\u00ad2004\nPercent 100\n80\n60 Other\n40\n20 Government\n0 1981 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004\nOECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development SOURCE: OECD, Main Science and Technology Indicators (2006).

Israel (not an OECD country), devoting 4.7% of its GDP to R&D, led all countries, followed by Sweden (3.9%), Finland (3.5%), and Japan (3.2%) (table O-4).\nMost non-European, non-OECD, or developing countries invest a smaller share of their economic output in R&D than do OECD members.

All Latin American countries for which such data exist have R&D/GDP ratios at or below 1%. The pattern of this indicator broadly reflects the wealth and level of economic development of these countries.\nHigh-income countries that emphasize the production of high-technology goods and services (i.e., have or are moving toward knowledge-intensive economies) are also those that tend to invest heavily in R&D activities. The private sector in low-income countries often has few high-technology industries, resulting in low overall R&D spending and therefore low R&D/GDP ratios (figure O-24).\nCountries have different investment levels for national defense and associated R&D. The ratio of nondefense R&D to GDP reflects the portion of R&D that is more directly tied to scientific progress, economic competitiveness, and standard-of-living improvements. On this indicator, the United States falls below Germany and just above Canada (figure O-25). This is because the United States devotes more of its R&D than any other country to defense (16% in 2006), primarily for development rather than research. For historical reasons, Germany and Japan spent less than 1% of their R&D on defense. Approximately 10% of the United Kingdom's total R&D was defense related in 2004.\n\nFigure O-24 Composition of GDP and R&D/GDP ratio for selected countries, by sector: 2006 or most recent year\nAgriculture Industry Services\n\nChina (1.34)\n\n12\n\nSouth Korea (2.99)\n\n3\n\nRussia (1.07) 5\n\nIndia (NA)\n\n20\n\n48 41 37\n19\n\n40 56 58 61\n\nCanada (1.95) 2 Italy (1.10) 2\nGermany (2.51) 1 Japan (3.18) 2 UK (1.73) 1 France (2.13) 2 U.S. (2.57) 1\n\n29 29 29 25 26 21 20\n\n69 69 70 73 73 77 79\n\n0\n\n20\n\nNA = not available GDP = gross domestic product; UK = United Kingdom\n\n40\n\n60\n\nPercent\n\n80\n\n100\n\nSOURCE: Central Intelligence Agency, The World Factbook 2007, http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/index.html, accessed 2 March 2007.

Among OECD countries with available data, Switzerland has the highest basic research/GDP ratio at 0.8% (figure O-26), significantly above the U.S. and Japanese ratios of 0.5% and 0.4%.\nSwitzerland devoted almost 30% of its R&D to basic research in 2004 (figure O-27).

The higher Swiss basic research share reflects the concentration of chemical and pharmaceutical R&D in Swiss industrial R&D and the \"niche strategy\" of focusing on specialty products adopted by many Swiss high-technology industries.\nChina, despite its growing R&D investment, has one of the lowest basic research/GDP ratios (0.07%), below Romania (0.08%) and Mexico (0.11%). With its emphasis on applied R&D aimed at short-term economic development, China follows the pattern of Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan whose basic research is 15% or less of total R&D (figure O-27).

Much of this work is supported by firms' foreign direct investment (FDI) to majority-owned affiliates abroad, reflected in the data shown in figure O-28.\nSince 1990, R&D expenditures by U.S. affiliates of foreign companies have increased faster than total U.S. industrial R&D, and for the past decade they have exceeded R&D performed overseas by majority-owned affiliates of U.S. parent companies (table O-5). U.S. affiliates of European companies accounted for three-fourths ($22.6 of $29.9 billion) of U.S. affiliates' R&D.\nOverseas R&D by U.S. MNCs has started shifting away from Europe, Canada, and Japan, which received 90% of all such funds in 1994 but only 80% in 2001. Increasingly, such R&D FDI is located in emerging Asian markets. This has led to considerable shifts in the region (figure O-29), where Japan's share remains the largest but has fallen from 64% in 1994 to 35% in 2004. In contrast, the Asian R&D shares of U.S. foreign affiliates located in China (including Hong Kong) and Singapore reached 17% and 14%, respectively,\n\nin 2004. U.S. affiliates' R&D expenditures in India doubled from $81 million in 2003 to $163 million in 2004, pushing India's Asia share just above 3%.\nIn 2004, three manufacturing industries accounted for 70% of U.S. foreign-affiliate R&D: transportation equipment (28%), chemicals including pharmaceuticals (23%), and computer and electronic products (19%) (table O-6). Among nonmanufacturing industries, professional, technical, and scientific services (which includes R&D and computer services) expended an additional 8%. The same three manufacturing industries accounted for 58% of the R&D performed by foreign affiliates in the United States: chemicals (34%), transportation equipment (13%), and computer and electronic products (11%).\nR&D in the United States is robust and dominated by industry.\nR&D growth in the United States was robust after the recession-related slowdown of 2001\u00ad02. After declining in 2002 for the first time since 1953 to $277 billion, U.S. R&D surpassed $300 billion in 2004 and is projected to increase to $340 billion in 2006.\nThe industrial sector, including manufacturing and services, accounts for the largest share of both U.S. R&D performance and funding (figure O-30). Its share of U.S. R&D performance increased from 66% in the early 1970s to a high of 75% in 2000. Following the 2001\u00ad02 recession, many firms curtailed R&D growth, and industry's share fell to 69% of the U.S. total before rising again to 71% in 2006. Industry funding shares behaved similarly, rising from about 40% in the early 1970s to a 2000 peak at 70%, dipping to 64% in 2004 and reaching 66% in 2006.\nFour manufacturing and two services industries account for more than three-fourths of all industrial R&D: computer and electronics products, chemicals, aerospace and defense manufacturing, automotive manufacturing, computer-related services, and R&D services. Their aggregate R&D intensity (R&D/net sales) was 7.7% in 2005; the comparable figure for all other industries was 1.3% (table O-7). In the manufacturing segment, nine automotive companies reported R&D expenditures of more than $100 million in 2004, representing more than 80% of this industry's R&D.\nThe federal government had for nearly three decades supplied half or more of the nation's total R&D funds, but in 1979 its share fell below 50%. It continued to drop to a low of 25% in 2000 but is projected to reach 28% in 2006 (figure O-31). This recent recovery mainly reflects increased health-related research spending and, more recently, rising development spending related to defense and counterterrorism. The federal government's performance share, about 20% of U.S. R&D in the early 1970s, has been declining and was 11% in 2006.\nDefense-related R&D has accounted for at least half of the federal R&D funding portfolio for the past three decades. It increased from 50% of the federal R&D budget in 1980 to almost 70% in the mid 1980s, declined to 53% in 2001, and\n\n\fO-20 \n\nOverview\n\nFigure O-28 R&D performed by U.S. affiliates of foreign companies in U.S., by investing region, and performed by foreign affiliates of U.S. multinational corporations, by host region: 2004 or most recent year\nCurrent U.S. dollars (billions)\n\n$4.93 $3.73\n\n$2.70\n\n$1.46\n\n$22.65\n\n$0.88\n\n$18.15\n\n$0.18 $0.83\n\n$1.07 $0.04\n\n$0.04\n\nNOTES: Preliminary estimates for 2004. 2002 data for U.S. affiliates of foreign companies from Latin America and Middle East.

Nondefense R&D is dominated by health support (52% of the proposed FY 2008 nondefense R&D budget) (figure O-32). Health R&D has accounted for the single largest share of federal nondefense R&D since at least 1980, when its share was 25%.\nU.S. R&D performance is dominated by the development function (figure O-33), which has fluctuated between 58% and 65% since 1970. Development of new and improved goods, services, and processes is dominated by industry, which funded 83% and performed 90% of all U.S. development in 2006. The federal government funded most of the remaining development performed in the United States, mostly in defense-related activities.\nBasic research provides the essential underpinning for a vibrant and flexible S&T system. In the United States, well over half (58%) of all basic research is conducted at universities and colleges. Two-thirds of the funding is supplied by the federal government, but the academic institutions themselves provided 17% in 2007, the second-largest share. An additional 5% to 6% each is provided by industry and state and local governments. A key product of academic basic research, in addition to new knowledge, is the production of young researchers through the strong ties of graduate training and research.\n\nFigure O-30 National R&D, by performing and funding sectors, 1953\u00ad2006\n\nConstant 2000 dollars (billions)\n\n250 Industry\n\nFederal government\n\n200\n\nU&C\n\nNonprofit organizations\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0 1953\n250\n200\n\n1961 1966 1971 1976 1981 1986 1991 1996 2001 2006 Performing sector\nIndustry Federal government Other\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0 1953\n\n1961 1966 1971 1976 1981 1986 1991 1996 2001 2006 Funding sector\n\nU&C = universities and colleges; Other = U&C, nonprofit, and state and local government\nNOTE: Federal performers of R&D includes federal agencies and federally funded research and development centers.\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, National Patterns of R&D Resources (annual series).

The expansion of higher education systems in many countries that started in the 1970s and continues today has enabled this shift to occur. Such broadening of higher education availability and access in many cases entailed greater relative emphasis than in the United States on education and training in engineering, natural sciences, and mathematics.\nDemographic structures, stable or shrinking populations, expanding opportunities in other fields, and declining interest in mathematics and science among the young are viewed by governments of many mature industrial countries as a potential threat to the sustained competitiveness of their economies. The topic has assumed increasing urgency in meetings of ministers of OECD member countries.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n O-23\n\n&IGURE/\n Federal R&D budget authority, by budget function:\nFY 1980\u00ad2008\n\n#ONSTANTDOLLARSBILLIONS\n\n Defense\n\nNondefense\n\n(EALTH\n\n3PACE\n\n\n\nEnergy\n\nGeneral science\n\nOther\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n./4%3/THERINCLUDESALLNONDEFENSEFUNCTIONSNOTSEPARATELY GRAPHED\fSUCHASAGRICULTUREANDTRANSPORTATIONINCREASEIN GENERALSCIENCEANDDECREASEINENERGYANDDECREASEINSPACE WERERESULTSOFRECLASSIFICATION 3/52#%.ATIONAL3CIENCE&OUNDATION\f$IVISIONOF3CIENCE 2ESOURCES3TATISTICS\f&EDERAL2$&UNDINGBY\"UDGET&UNCTION &ISCAL9EARSpFORTHCOMING 3EEAPPENDIXTABLE\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\nGrowing educational and technical sophistication mark international workforces and reduce traditional U.S. advantage.\nReliable, internationally comparable data on S&E labor force growth are unavailable. However, the number of individuals 15 years and older with a tertiary education, broadly comparable to at least a U.S. technical school or associate's degree, can serve as a proxy measure for the expansion of highly educated populations. A two-decade snapshot shows very rapid growth in overall numbers and considerable shifts in the geographical location of these individuals (figure O-34).\nFrom 1980 to 2000 (the latest available estimate), the number of individuals with a tertiary education rose from 73 million to 194 million, a 165% increase. The U.S. share of these degree holders declined from 31% to 27%.\nJapan's shrinking share of the tertiary educated (from 10% to just above 6%) notwithstanding, the combined total of five other Asian nations, China, India, South Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand, rose from 14% in 1980 to 34% in 2000, an increase from 10 million to 66 million. The 56 million people added by these countries alone broadly match the entire 2000 U.S. total.\nWorldwide, researcher numbers are rising robustly. The size of the research workforce is another indicator of\nthe economic importance of efforts to develop new knowledge and innovative products and processes. As is the case\n\nFigure O-33 National R&D expenditures, by character of work, and basic research, by performer and source of funds: 2006\nPercent\n100\nDevelopment\n\n80 Other nonprofit\nU&C 60\nFederal government\nIndustry 40\n\nApplied research 20\nBasic research 0 National R&D\n\nBasic\n\nBasic\n\nresearch by research by\n\nperformer source of funds\n\nU&C = universities and colleges\nNOTES: Figures rounded to nearest whole number.

However, OECD captures such figures for its member countries and selected other economies. For all these combined, the data show robust 50% growth from 1995 to 2005 (figure O-35).\nThis overall growth was uneven, with the number of researchers doubling in selected non-OECD economies including China,7 slower growth in the United States (35%) and the EU (29%), stagnation in Japan (5%), and fasterthan-average growth in the other OECD member countries (60%). The overall trend is toward an increase in personnel dedicated to R&D functions in the world's economies. According to OECD, a strong countervailing trend persists in the Russian Federation, where the number of researchers dropped from 610,000 in 1995 to 465,000 in 2005.\nIn the United States, S&E occupations have long grown faster than others.\nLong-term data on the U.S. workforce show a trend toward increasing numbers of workers in S&T-related occupations (figure O-36). Although different data sources yield somewhat different estimates of the size of the S&E labor force, there is no doubt that overall growth has been large\n\n\fO-24 \n\nOverview\n\nFigure O-34 Population 15 years old or older with tertiary education, by country/region: 1980 and 2000\n\nUnited States 31.1%\n\nOther 20.8%\n\nUnited States 27.1%\n\nOther 23.9%\n\nChina 5.4% India 4.1% Russia 13.4%\n\nFrance 1.5% Mexico 1.0% Thailand 0.3% United Kingdom 2.9% South Korea 1.7% Brazil 1.8% Germany 3.1% Philippines 2.9%\nJapan 9.9%\n\n1980 (73 million)\n\nChina 10.8%\nIndia 7.7% Russia 7.0%\n\nFrance 1.5% Mexico 1.5% Thailand 1.6% United Kingdom 2.2%\nSouth Korea 2.3% Brazil 2.3%\nGermany 2.8% Philippines 2.9% Japan 6.4%\n\n2000 (194 million)\n\nSOURCE: Adapted from Barro RJ and Lee J-W, Center for International Development, International Data on Educational Attainment (2000).

During this period, growth patterns within individual occupations have varied. In the 1990s, for example, widespread computerization was accompanied by a sharp rise in the numbers of people working as mathematicians and information technologists, while the number of workers classified as engineers or technicians changed relatively little.\nFor decades, the workforce growth rates in S&E occupations have exceeded those in the general labor force (figure\n\nFigure O-36 Science and technology employment: 1950\u00ad2000\n\nEmployees (millions)\n\n6\n\nAll S&T employees\n\nS&E\n\nLife scientists\n\n5\n\nPhysical scientists\n\nEngineers\n\nMathematicians/ information technologists\n\n4\n\nSocial scientists\n\nTechnicians\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0 1950\n\n1960\n\n1970\n\n1980\n\n1990\n\n2000\n\nS&T = science and technology\nNOTE: Data include bachelor's degrees or higher in science occupations, some college and above in engineering occupations, and any education level for technicians and computer programmers.\nSOURCE: Adapted from Lowell BL, Regets MC, A Half-Century Snapshot of the STEM Workforce, 1950 to 2000, Commission on Professionals in Science and Technology (2006).\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n O-25\n\nO-37); consequently, the proportion of the workforce in S&E occupations has risen by 60% since the early 1980s. Nonetheless, S&E employees still represent a small fraction of the total U.S. workforce: the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey estimates that jobs in S&E occupations increased from 2.6% in 1983 to 4.2% in 2006 (figure O-38).\nIndividuals in S&E occupations are distributed throughout the economy (figure O-39). Economic sectors with large proportions of workers in S&E occupations tend to have higher average salaries for both S&E workers and those in other occupations (table O-8).

Census data show how this movement toward a more knowledge-intensive economy is reflected in the changing profile of the workforce (Figure O-40). Since 1950, workers in S&E occupations have been found disproportionately in the younger cohorts of the prime working-age population (ages 25\u00ad64). Among workers 25\u00ad 34 years old, the proportion of S&E workers increased from 1.7% in 1950 to 5.2% in 2000. Similar increases occurred in the other prime working-age groups, with the proportion of workers in S&E occupations approximately tripling in each group between 1950 and 2000 (figure O-40).\nOver a lifetime, workers move both into and out of S&E jobs. Those moving into S&E jobs may have acquired the necessary skills through workforce experience or adult education to respond to the growing demand for S&E workers; those moving out of these jobs may acquire managerial roles, change occupations, or fail to maintain or acquire S&E-related skills that are in demand. For each generation of workers, the numbers in S&E occupations increase until some time in midlife and then decrease as workers near or reach retirement. In the generations born before or during World War II, the proportion of workers who were in S&E occupations at different ages did not follow a consistent pattern. For example, for those born between 1936 and 1945,\n\nFigure O-38 U.S. workforce in S&E occupations: 1983\u00ad2006\n\nS&E employees (millions) (bars) 7\n\nWorkforce (%) (line) 4.5\n\n6\n\n4.0\n\n3.5 5\n3.0\n\n4\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n2.0\n\n1.5 2\n1.0\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1983 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, special tabulations from Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Population Survey Monthly Outgoing Rotation files (1983\u00ad2006).\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nFigure O-39 Largest sectors of employment for individuals in S&E occupations, by NAICS sector: May 2005\n\nManagement of companies and enterprises 4%\nWholesale trade 4%\nFinance and insurance 5%\n\nOther 11%\n\nProfessional, scientific, and\ntechnical services 28%\n\nInformation 9%\nGovernment 11%\n\nManufacturing 17%\n\nEducational services 11%\nNAICS = North American Industry Classification System SOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Employment Statistics Survey (2005).\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\fO-26 \n\nOverview\n\nTable O-8 Employment distribution and average earnings of 4-digit NAICS industry classifications, by proportion of employment in S&E occupations: 2005\n\nAverage worker salary ($)\n\nWorkers in S&E occupations (%)\n\nAll\n\nAll S&E\n\noccupations occupations\n\nNon-S&E occupations\n\nS&E occupations\n\n>40 ....................................................................................... 20\u00ad40 .................................................................................... 10\u00ad20 .................................................................................... 4\u00ad10 ...................................................................................... <4 .........................................................................................\n\n1,987,910 3,384,810 9,951,540 13,728,020 99,480,140\n\n918,400 952,320 1,444,490 880,540 988,950\n\n66,980 51,350 51,588 44,260 33,489\n\n74,335 75,195 69,819 64,578 59,713\n\nNAICS = North American Industry Classification System\n\nNOTE: NAICS is a hierarchical structure that uses 2\u00ad4 digits; 4-digit NAICS industries are subsets of 3-digit industries, which are subsets of 2-digit sectors.\n\nSOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Employment Statistics Survey (May 2004 and May 2005).\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nFigure O-40 Workers in S&E occupations, by age group: 1950\u00ad2000\nPercent 6\n1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0 25\u00ad34 years 35\u00ad44 years 45\u00ad54 years 55\u00ad64 years Age group\nSOURCE: Census Bureau, decennial census, various years.

Beginning with the \"baby boom\" generation of workers born after World War II (1946\u00ad55), the proportion in S&E occupations increased substantially with time. Thus, 2.8% of baby boomers were in S&E occupations in 1980, rising to 3.8% in 2000; for workers born in the next decade, the proportion increased from 3.5% in 1990 to 4.6% in 2000 (figure O-41).

Although most people with S&E degrees do not work in S&E occupations, a large majority of degree holders say that they need at least a bachelor's degree-level knowledge of S&E in their jobs (figure O-42).\nMost S&E degree holders work in for-profit companies. In 2003, about three of five individuals whose highest degree was in S&E worked in this sector. Education (16%) and government (13%) were the next largest employers of workers with S&E degrees. Among those with S&E doctoral\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n O-27\n\ndegrees, the higher education sector is the largest employer (44%), but the for-profit sector share is also large (33%) (figure O-43). These data suggest that many for-profit companies find S&T-related skills, including the advanced skills associated with doctoral education, useful for competing in the private economy.\nAlmost 40% of R&D workers are found in non-S&E occupations.\nWorkers with S&E degrees for whom R&D is a significant work activity have backgrounds in a variety of S&E fields, suggesting that R&D skills relevant to a knowledge-intensive economy can develop through multiple paths. Substantially more of these R&D workers are trained in engineering than in any other field. A sizeable proportion of S&E-trained workers for whom R&D is a major work activity are not in S&E occupations (39%), and many of them (26%) are not in S&E-related occupations. For workers who devote at least 10% of their work time to R&D, the comparable proportions (55% and 40%) are even higher (figure O-44).\nHigher Education\nAs knowledge becomes more central to economic activity in both developed and developing economies, large segments of the population complete some form of higher education. Government programs designed to advance the development of a knowledge-intensive economy bolster private incentives to obtain knowledge and skills that may lead to better, higher-paying jobs. Lifelong learning, including acquisition of additional formal education, becomes both more possible and more necessary even for people with significant workforce experience.\nFigure O-42 Bachelor's degree-level S&E knowledge needed by individuals in workforce with highest degree in S&E: 2003\n\nEducational credentials are only an approximate indicator of useful labor force skills. They do not register quality differences, skills acquired through job experiences or informal learning, or skills decay brought on by the progress of knowledge and economic change. In addition, workers may take advantage of publicly supported educational opportunities to gain labor market advantages, but may not use the additional skills at work, while employers may hire readily available workers without using their most advanced skills.\nHuman capital development responds to incentives of the knowledge-intensive economy.\nIn international comparison, the United States has a larger proportion of the working-age population with a higher education degree (39%) than most other countries (figure O-45). Only the Russian Federation (55%), Israel (45%), and Canada (45%) have higher percentages for this indicator.\n\nFigure O-43 Employment sector for individuals with highest degree in S&E and S&E doctorate holders: 2003\n4-year college/university 9%\nSelf-employed 6%\n\nFor profit 59%\n\nGovernment 13%\nNonprofit 6% Other education 7% S&E highest degree\n\nNeither 35%\n\nNS&E 47%\n\nBoth NS&E and social sciences 5%\nSocial sciences 13%\nNS&E = natural sciences and engineering SOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), 2003, http://sestat.nsf.gov.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nFor profit 33%\n\n4-year college/ university 44%\n\nOther education 3%\n\nNonprofit 5%\n\nGovernment 9%\n\nSelf-employed 6%\n\nS&E doctorate\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), 2003, http://sestat.nsf.gov.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\fO-28 \n\nFigure O-44 Distribution of S&E degree holders with R&D as major or significant work activity, by field of highest degree and occupation: 2003\n\nSocial sciences 21.2%\n\nEngineering 35.8%\n\nPhysical sciences 10.0%\n\nComputer/ Mathematical sciences 16.8%\n\nLife sciences 16.2%\n\nR&D as major work activity, by field of highest degree\n\nOther non-S&E 26.3%\n\nEngineers 24.4%\n\nS&Erelated 13.2%\n\nLife scientists\n7.9%\n\nSocial scientists 4.8% Physical scientists 5.5%\n\nComputer/ mathematical scientists 18.1%\n\nR&D as major work activity, by occupation\n\nOther non-S&E 39.9%\n\nEngineers 17.7%\nLife scientists\n5.1%\n\nS&E-related 15.1%\n\nComputer/ mathematical\nscientists 14.8%\nPhysical scientists 3.7% Social scientists 3.8%\n\nWorkers spending at least 10% of work time on R&D, by occupation\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), 2003, http://sestat.nsf.gov.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nOverview\n\nFigure O-45 Total tertiary degree attainment by 25\u00ad64-year-olds, by country: 2004\nRussian Federation (2003)\nIsrael Canada United States Japan (2003) Sweden Finland Denmark Norway Australia South Korea Belgium Netherlands United Kingdom Ireland Switzerland Iceland\nSpain New Zealand OECD average\nGermany France\nLuxembourg Greece Austria\nHungary Mexico Poland Chile Portugal\nSlovak Republic Czech Republic\nItaly Turkey\nBrazil\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nPercent\n\nOECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n\nNOTES: Tertiary education includes International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) levels 5A, 5B, and 6 programs.

For OECD member countries, the average difference between the youngest cohort with generally completed formal schooling and the working-age population as a whole is about 6 percentage points; in several nations the difference is more than 10 percentage points. Differences are especially large for South Korea and Japan, the two Asian OECD members, but some European countries (France, Ireland, Spain, and Belgium) also recorded substantial differences.\nThe United States and Germany are exceptions to the overall OECD pattern: in these two countries there is no substantial difference between the 25\u00ad34-year-olds and the working-age population as a whole. These age patterns in educational attainment suggest that, in the future, other developed countries will more closely resemble the United States in the availability of workers with postsecondary credentials (figure O-46).\nSubstantial advanced training prepares the U.S. workforce for high-skill work.\nThe proportion of 25\u00ad64-year-olds with advanced8 education, as evidenced by a bachelor's degree or beyond, is an indicator of the workforce that is equipped to develop and apply knowledge in innovative ways. In the United States, a substantially higher proportion than in other large, developed economies has completed such a course of study, although a few smaller countries have proportions that match or nearly match the U.S. percentage (figure O-47). Such additional training can prepare students for high-skill work and more advanced training in research.\nThroughout the developed world, the proportion of the population in the youngest working cohort with education at or beyond the bachelor's level is higher than for the workingage population as a whole. Again, however, this difference is smaller in the United States and Germany than in any of the other countries for which data are available. As younger cohorts of workers enter the labor forces in the future, the U.S. lead on this indicator can be expected to shrink. Nonetheless, the United States ranks behind only a few small countries-- Norway, Israel, the Netherlands, and South Korea--in the proportion of the cohort that is entering the labor force that receives this kind of education (figure O-48).\nAdvanced training in natural sciences and engineering is becoming widespread, eroding the U.S. advantage.\nThe number of first university degrees a nation awards in natural sciences and engineering (NS&E) is a workforce indicator that is more specifically focused on a nation's capacity to innovate in S&T. Because of its population size, the United States has seen much larger numerical increases in first university NS&E degrees than other countries.

The rising number of Chinese-trained engineers is similarly striking, especially in contrast with declining numbers of U.S. engineering graduates (Figure O-49).\nMany countries have also increased the numbers of individuals they train in NS&E at the doctoral level over the past 20 years (Figure O-50).

Experienced in adapting to life in a different culture and equipped with flexible skills, these workers are well positioned to compete in a global market for knowledge workers.\nIn the United States, increasing proportions of S&E workers are foreign born and/or foreign educated, a fact that has been interpreted from a variety of perspectives. Some observers stress strengths of the U.S. economy that pull in foreign workers, including the attractiveness of living in the United States and the favorable opportunities for high incomes and career advancement in the S&E workforce. Other observers express concern about the inability of U.S. society to prepare and interest young Americans in the S&E jobs that the economy makes available (see section on U.S. K\u00ad12 education).\nAccording to census data, the number of foreign-born workers in the U.S. S&E workforce more than quadrupled between 1980 and 2000, with most of the increase taking place in the 1990s. As a result, the percentage of foreignborn workers in the U.S. S&E workforce increased from nearly 10% in 1980 to 12% in 1990 and 18% in 2000.\nIncreases occurred among S&E workers at all educational levels but were especially pronounced among the more highly educated (figure O-52). Thus, the proportion of foreignborn doctorate-level workers rose from 24% in 1990 to 38% in 2000, and the corresponding figures for master's-level workers were 19% and 29%. Census data for 2005 shown in figure O-52, although not fully comparable to the earlier data, suggest that the percentage of foreign-born workers is continuing to increase. In addition, a growing proportion of S&E doctoral faculty, who are not included in the census data counts, are also foreign born. Their proportion increased from 21% in 1992 to 28% in 2003.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n O-33\n\nFigure O-53 Student, exchange, and other high-skill-related U.S. temporary visas issued: 1998\u00ad2006\n\nThousands 350\n\n300 Student\n\nExchange visitor\n\n250\n\n200\nOther high-skill 150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006\nNOTE: Student = F-1; exchange visitor = J-1; other high-skill-related visas = L-1, H-1B, H-3, O-1, O-2, and TN.

Student visas in particular dropped by 25% in the immediately succeeding years, a decline that prompted concern about the long-term impact on the United States' ability to attract the best foreign talent.\n\nThe latest data show an upswing in high-skill-related visas issued, starting in 2004 and carrying into 2006, with record numbers of temporary high-skill-related visas issued. The number of student and exchange-visitor visas issued in 2006 was higher than ever before, and the sum of the other high-skill-related visa categories was near the 2001 high, suggesting a continuing attractiveness of the United States to those with advanced education.\nU.S. K\u00ad12 Education\nConcern about the relationship of science and mathematics achievement to American global competitiveness, workforce preparation, and development of an educated citizenry has drawn intensive public scrutiny to the achievement levels of American students in mathematics and science in recent years.\nMathematics and science performance of U.S. students: both disappointing and encouraging.\nThe current performance of U.S. elementary and secondary students in mathematics and science is both disappointing and encouraging. A national study that followed the same student cohort found that students from different demographic groups entered kindergarten with varied mathematics knowledge and skills, that all groups made gains during elementary school, and that gains were uneven. Thus most mathematics achievement gaps remained or had grown by the time students reached grade 5 (table O-9 and appendix table 1-2). A second national cohort study that assessed mathematics knowledge in both grades 10 and 12 mirrored the findings of the previous study.\nRepeated cross-sectional studies of mathematics and science performance provide information about trends in the performance of different student cohorts.

Performance scores for U.S. eighth graders in mathematics and science were improved over those in the 1995 TIMSS, but scores for fourth graders showed no change.\nHowever, U.S. 15-year-olds scored below the international average in both mathematics and science on the 2003 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) tests, which were intended to measure students' ability to apply\n\nTable O-10 Changes in mathematics performance of students in grades 4 and 8, by student characteristics and other factors: 1990\u00ad2005 and 2003\u00ad05\n\nGrade 4\n\nGrade 8\n\nStudent characteristic\n\n1990\u00ad2005 2003\u00ad05 1990\u00ad2005 2003\u00ad05\n\nAverage score\n\nTotal .................................................................................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSex ...............................................................................................................\n\nMale ..........................................................................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFemale ......................................................................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRace/ethnicity\n\nWhite, non-Hispanic .................................................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack, non-Hispanic .................................................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHispanic ....................................................................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian/Pacific Islandera ..............................................................................\n\nNA\n\n\n\nNA\n\n\n\nAmerican Indian/Alaska Nativeb ...............................................................\n\nNA\n\n\n\nNA\n\n\u00b7\n\nPercentile scoresc\n\n10th ..................................................................................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25th ..................................................................................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50th ..................................................................................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n75th ..................................................................................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n90th ..................................................................................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n = increase; \u00b7 = no change;  = decrease (based on t-tests using unrounded numbers); NA = not available\n\naInsufficient sample size in 1990 for Asian/Pacific Islanders precluded calculation of reliable estimates. bInsufficient sample size in 1990 for American Indians/Alaska Natives precluded calculation of reliable estimates. cPercentage of students whose scores fell below a particular score, e.g., 75% of students had scores <75th percentile.\n\nSOURCES: National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), The Nation's Report Card: Mathematics 2005, NCES 2006-453 (2006); National Assessment of Educational Progress, 1990, 1996, 2003, and 2005 mathematics assessments; and National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, special tabulations.

Increased government recognition of the importance of knowledge-intensive segments of their economies often led to the implementation of strategic policies to promote their development, and the expansion of education and advanced training in support of this goal. MNCs, seeking new markets and a broad range of operating efficiencies and responding to opportunities abroad, increasingly took advantage of and drove these developments, resulting in a shift in the epicenter of world S&T activities, led by China's emergence, toward several rapidly growing Asian economies.\nThese pronounced shifts have occurred over a relatively short time and have had a differential impact on mature, developed countries. In Asia, China's rapid rise economically and across the S&T spectrum has made it the world's second-largest economy, and certain other smaller Asian economies are increasingly prominent on the world stage.\n\n\fO-36 \n\nOverview\n\nBy comparison Japan appears stagnant and, in fact, has lost world market share in a number of S&T areas. The EU's world position has also degraded, including in areas linked to high-technology trade. The United States is broadly holding its own, thanks, in part, to its large, mature, and diversified S&T system. But it, too, faces robust challenges affecting its education, workforce, R&D, and S&T systems that arise from the far-reaching and rapid worldwide changes.\nAfterword: Data Gaps and Needs\nScience and Engineering Indicators leaves many questions about the state of the S&E enterprise unanswered. Nationally representative or internationally comparable information is lacking about significant factual aspects of the S&T community in the United States and abroad. Following are some examples.\nChapter 1. Elementary and Secondary Education\n Informal learning experiences in K\u00ad12 education, including advanced courses taken in local colleges or via distance learning; participation in research, science or technology competitions, or internships; advanced coursetaking in engineering; and involvement in informal S&E learning through museums, science centers, zoos, planetariums, aquariums, and similar community-based institutions\n Teacher preparation and quality, including elementary teacher qualifications in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines and STEM teacher test scores on subject matter knowledge\n STEM teacher career paths, including better data on teacher mobility across different kinds of schools and districts, reentry into teaching, and teachers on temporary visas or other noncitizen teachers\n Teacher involvement in informal learning\nChapter 2. Higher Education in Science and Engineering\n Emergence of multidisciplinary degree programs, new fields, and new institutional forms\n Student involvement in research experiences or in cooperative learning programs\n Undergraduate involvement in R&D work  Quality indicators for postsecondary STEM teaching\nChapters 1 and 2\n Internationally comparable indicators of curriculum content or rigor\n Indicators of achievement or interest in STEM for gifted students at all education levels\n\nChapter 3. Science and Engineering Labor Force\n Internationally comparable data on S&T workforce characteristics\n Worldwide data, including industry breakdowns, on international flows of workers with S&T training, in S&Trelated occupations, and/or performing R&D\n S&T-related skills used in the workforce and non-S&T skills that S&E workers use in their jobs\n Data on the role of postdoctorates in the nonacademic S&E workforce\n Employer-provided training and other forms of lifelong learning for S&E workers\n S&E workforce location relative to employer location\nChapters 4. Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages, and 6. Industry, Technology, and the Global Marketplace\n R&D by line of business (For companies with more than one line of business, current industry R&D data attribute R&D to the company as a whole and not necessarily to the part of the company for which the work is done.)\n R&D in relation to firm or line-of-business characteristics, including profitability, productivity, growth, etc.\n R&D performance data on very small companies (fewer than five employees), state and local governments, nonprofit organizations, and individuals performing R&D independent of a corporation, university, or other organization\n Non-S&E R&D outside academic institutions (Other countries collect these data and include them in their national statistics.)\n R&D in international commerce, including R&D performed in the United States that is financed from foreign sources, characteristics (e.g., basic, applied, or development work; location) of R&D expenditures by U.S. affiliates of foreign multinational corporations, characteristics of R&D expenditures by foreign affiliates of U.S. multinational corporations, and trade in knowledge-intensive service industries\n Innovation indicators, including technology licensing; numbers, characteristics, R&D activities, and other operations data for business technology alliances; and technology parks, clusters, and incubators\n Outsourcing and offshoring of S&E jobs\nChapter 5. Academic Research and Development\n R&D funded from institutional or departmental resources and not separately budgeted, including use of funds for infrastructure, equipment, student support, and other purposes, and ultimate source of institutional or departmental funds\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n O-37\n\n R&D expenditures by U.S. corporations at foreign universities and by foreign corporations at U.S. universities\n Individuals who author S&E articles (Current data attribute articles to institutions or departments and do not include information about the characteristics of individual authors [e.g., employer, employment sector, disciplinary background, national origins, collaborative patterns, career stage, main work activities])\n Indicators of multidisciplinary S&E research\n Accessibility, use, and other characteristics of large, curated academic databases\nChapters 4 and 5\n Indicators of the spread, development, and use of R&Drelated cyberinfrastructure\n Worldwide centers of R&D excellence by discipline and industry\nThese gaps are descriptive and could be addressed with new data. However, in many cases, gaps are as much analysis gaps as they are data gaps. To understand the global flow of S&E workers, for example, will require not only better, more internationally comparable data about credentials, skills, and migration patterns, but will also require developing models and testing hypotheses based on data that already exist (Regets 2007). Similarly, understanding the determinants of technological innovation involves building theories of innovation, testing them against existing data, and identifying and collecting new data that would be necessary to elaborate and test promising theoretical models (Nelson 1993). Accordingly, as part of a recent White House Office of Science and Technology Policy initiative, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has begun a program to support fundamental research aimed at developing a Science of Science and Innovation Policy. The initial emphases of the program are on analytic tools and model building.\nMany other questions relevant to science policy involve a similar interplay among theory, analysis, and data. In addition, compelling answers to the \"why\" and \"what if\" questions that policymakers often ask can remain uncertain even when data bearing on these questions are available.\nThe federal government and its statistical agencies continuously engage in efforts to address significant data gaps or enhance the quality of the data generated from ongoing collections. Current examples include:\n Redesign of NSF's Survey of Industrial Research and Development to collect data on the line of business to which R&D is attributable in diversified firms, foreign R&D activities of companies that do R&D in the United States, technology licensing activities, and demographic and educational characteristics of the U.S. R&D workforce.\n A project of NSF's Division of Science Resources Statistics (SRS) to count nonacademic postdoctorates and collect data on the work roles and demographic, career, and educational characteristics of postdoctorates.\n\n Collaboration between the Department of Homeland Security and SRS to examine whether immigration records can be made available for use as a basis for collecting more timely and complete data on foreign-educated scientists and engineers.\n A Department of Commerce advisory committee effort to identify \"holes\" in the national data collection system that limit the nation's ability to measure innovation.\nCollecting high-quality data can be exceedingly expensive, and governments cannot afford to collect all the data they could use productively. Beyond cost, however, there are numerous other persistent obstacles to remedying data gaps:\n Many concepts in the list of data gaps are difficult to measure. Informal learning experiences, teaching quality, S&E-related workplace training, multidisciplinary research, and innovation are less readily classified and quantified than many of the S&E indicators reported in this volume.\n For difficult-to-measure concepts, a succession of smallscale studies is usually necessary to refine measures and test them in a variety of situations before national or international data collection is possible. This kind of development work takes time.\n For S&T data to be meaningful, organizations and individuals must be willing and able to supply reasonably accurate information. In some cases, the burden on survey respondents of supplying such information makes it impossible to secure the necessary cooperation and collect good data.\n As S&T becomes increasingly globalized, internationally comparable data become increasingly important for mapping personnel and resource flows. Successful efforts under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development to coordinate the collection of R&D data across numerous national statistical systems indicate that coordination is feasible, but also that it is difficult and resource intensive.\n Data are most valuable when they extend back in time as well as outward across national boundaries. New data will not be able to address many questions until several data collection cycles have been completed.\n Legal and technical obstacles limit opportunities for merging data from different sources and making merged data widely available for analysis. Obstacles associated with merging datasets from different countries are especially daunting.\nNotes\n1. Data drawn from Conference Board and Groningen Growth and Development Centre, Total Economy Database (January 2007), http://www.ggdc.net, are measured in constant 1990 purchasing power parities (PPPs) converted into\n\n\fO-38 \n\nOverview\n\nU.S. dollars. World Bank data are based on different conversion factors but show congruent trends.\n2. No internationally comparable data on in-country inequality are available.\n3. The growth rate of real per capita GDP is measured in constant 1990 PPPs.\n4. The estimated total is extended backwards to 1985. 5. Data in the overview are more current than those available in chapter 4. 6. Distinctions between basic and applied research often involve a greater element of subjective assessment than other R&D indicators, and about 40% of the OECD countries do not report these data at the national level. Nonetheless, where these data exist, they help differentiate national innovation systems in terms of how their R&D resources contribute to advancing scientific knowledge and developing new technologies. 7. Time-series data are available for China, Taiwan, Singapore, Romania, and Slovenia. 8. \"Advanced\" degrees are defined as International Standard Classification of Education Degrees, tertiary-type A and advanced research programs only.\nGlossary\nAffiliate: A company or business enterprise located in one country but owned or controlled (in terms of 10% or more of voting securities or equivalent) by a parent company in another country; may be either incorporated or unincorporated.\nApplied research: The objective of applied research is to gain knowledge or understanding to meet a specific, recognized need. In industry, applied research includes investigations to discover new scientific knowledge that has specific commercial objectives with respect to products, processes, or services.\nAsia-10: Includes China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand.\nBasic research: The objective of basic research is to gain more comprehensive knowledge or understanding of the subject under study without specific applications in mind. Although basic research may not have specific applications as its goal, it can be directed in fields of present or potential interest. This is often the case with basic research performed by industry or mission-driven federal agencies.\nDevelopment: Development is the systematic use of the knowledge or understanding gained from research directed toward the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes.\nEU-25: Includes the EU-15 countries Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In 2004 the EU expanded to 25 members with the addition of 10 more countries: Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia.\n\nEU-27: Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU-25 (see definition above) in January 2007, for a total of 27 EU member countries.\nForeign affiliate: Company located overseas but owned by a U.S. parent.\nForeign direct investment (FDI): Ownership or control of 10% or more of the voting securities (or equivalent) of a business located outside the home country.\nG-7: The group of seven industrialized nations: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nGross domestic product (GDP): Market value of goods and services produced within a country.\nIntellectual property: Intangible property that is the result of creativity; the most common forms of intellectual property include patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets.\nKnowledge-intensive economies: Economies with a large number of industries that incorporate science, engineering, and technology into their products and services.\nMultinational corporation (MNC): A parent company and its foreign affiliates.\nR&D: According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, R&D, also called research and experimental development, comprises creative work \"undertaken on a systematic basis to increase the stock of knowledge--including knowledge of man, culture, and society--and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications\" (OECD 2002, p. 30).\nR&D intensity: Measure of R&D expenditures relative to size, production, or other characteristic of a country or R&D-performing sector. Examples include companyfunded R&D to net sales ratio, R&D to GDP ratio, and R&D per employee.\nU.S. affiliate: Company located in the United States but owned by a foreign parent.\nReferences\nNelson RR, editor. 1993.

Elementary and Secondary Education\n\nHighlights\n\nStudent Learning in Mathematics and Science\nAll student groups made gains in mathematics and science during elementary and high school, but performance disparities were evident, and some gaps widened as students progressed through school.\n Studies that follow the same groups of students as they progress through school reveal performance disparities among demographic subgroups starting when they enter kindergarten. Students from financially poorer families or whose mother had less formal education entered kindergarten with lower levels of mathematics skills and knowledge than their more advantaged peers. Substantial racial/ethnic gaps in mathematics performance were also observed. Although all subgroups made gains in mathematics and science during elementary school, the rates of growth varied and some of the achievement gaps widened.\n Mathematics performance gaps among demographic subgroups were evident in 10th grade and some continued to widen through 12th grade.\nIn 2005, U.S. fourth and eighth grade students outperformed those tested in the 1990s in mathematics, and fourth grade students improved in science.\n Increases in fourth and eighth grade mathematics scores from 1990 to 2005 were widespread, occurring among males and females, all racial/ethnic groups, students from financially disadvantaged and advantaged families, and students performing at all levels of achievement. Some mathematics achievement gaps did decrease over the same period.\n Widespread increases in mathematics from the 1990s to 2005 were not matched in science. Since 1996, the first year the current national science assessment was given, average science scores increased for 4th graders, held steady for 8th graders, and declined for 12th graders.\nStandards and Student Coursetaking\nIn 2006, slightly more than half the states required 3 or more years of both mathematics and science courses for high school graduation.\n Students in more than 40 states were required to complete at least 2 years of both mathematics and science in high school; 3 years was the most common requirement for both subjects, in effect in just over half the states. Very few states required 4 years in either subject, and only one state required 4 years in both.\n\nState development of course content standards has progressed in recent years and standards continue to be reviewed and revised.\n All states had issued content standards in mathematics and science by 2006\u00ad07, and 35 states had schedules for reviewing and revising those standards.\nTrends from 1990 to 2005 show increases in advanced coursetaking; growth was especially strong in mathematics.\n Class of 2005 graduates completed mathematics courses at far higher rates than their 1990 counterparts in all categories except trigonometry/algebra III. The proportion of students completing courses in precalculus/analysis, calculus, and Advanced Placement/International Baccalaureate (AP/IB) calculus at least doubled since 1990. Nonetheless, completion of advanced mathematics courses remained below 20% in 2005 except for precalculus/ analysis.\n Student course completion rates have increased since 1990 in advanced biology, chemistry, and physics, although they leveled off between 2000 and 2005.\n For AP/IB courses, coursetaking rates have not changed significantly for chemistry or physics, but increased slightly for biology and doubled for calculus and environmental science. Despite this growth, just less than 10% of graduates completed an AP/IB calculus course, the highest rate for any AP/IB course.\nCourse completion rates differed in the graduating class of 2005 by several demographic and school characteristics.\n Males and females completed advanced mathematics courses at about equal rates, except for precalculus/analysis, where females had a slight advantage. Females studied biology and chemistry at higher rates, whereas males studied physics, engineering, and engineering/science technologies at higher rates.\n Asian/Pacific Islanders were the most likely of all racial/ ethnic groups to earn credits in many mathematics and science subjects, especially in AP/IB classes in calculus, biology, chemistry, and physics.\nMathematics and Science Teacher Quality\nMost mathematics and science teachers have the basic teaching qualifications of a college degree and full state certification.\n Virtually all public school mathematics and science teachers had at least a bachelor's degree and half had an advanced degree such as a master's or doctorate.\n A large majority of mathematics and science teachers (84% in 2003) held standard or advanced certification issued by their state.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 1-5\n\n At least 75% of 2003 mathematics and science teachers with less than 5 years of teaching experience participated in practice teaching before their first teaching job. Although practice teaching contributes to new teachers' confidence in their ability to perform their first jobs, practice teaching declined from 1999 to 2003.\nThe majority of public high school mathematics and science teachers had a college major or certification in their subject field, that is, they were \"in-field\" teachers. Infield teaching was less common in middle schools than in high schools.\n In 2003, 78%\u00ad92% of mathematics, biology, and physical science teachers in public high schools were teaching in field. Out-of-field teachers (that is, teachers teaching their subject with neither a major nor certification in the subject matter field, a related field, or general education) ranged from 2% of physical science teachers to 8% of mathematics teachers.\n The proportion of in-field mathematics and science teachers in middle schools was lower (33%\u00ad55%) than in high schools (78%\u00ad92%). About 3%\u00ad10% were teaching out of field.\nTeachers in schools with low concentrations of minority and low-income students tended to have more education, better preparation and qualifications, and more experience than teachers in schools with high concentrations of such students.\n Mathematics and science teachers in low-minority and low-poverty schools were more likely than their colleagues in high-minority and high-poverty schools to have a master's or higher degree and to hold full certification.\n Mathematics and science teachers in low-minority and low-poverty schools were more likely to teach in field than their colleagues in high-minority and high-poverty schools.\n New mathematics and science teachers (those with 3 or fewer years of teaching experience) were more prevalent in high-minority and high-poverty schools than in lowminority and low-poverty schools.\nProfessional Development of Mathematics and Science Teachers\nParticipation in induction and mentoring programs was widespread.\n In 2003, 68%\u00ad72% of beginning mathematics and science teachers in public middle and high schools reported that they had participated in a formal teacher induction program or had worked closely with a mentor teacher during their first year of teaching.\n\nTeacher participation in professional development was common. However, various features of professional development identified as being effective in bringing about changes in teaching practices were not widespread.\n In 2003, more than 70% of mathematics and science teachers in public middle and high schools participated in professional development focusing on the content of their subject field. About two-thirds attended professional development in using computers for instruction. Professional development most frequently took the form of workshops, conferences, and training sessions (91% in 2003).\n Recent research has found that intensive participation of at least 60\u00ad80 hours may be necessary to bring about meaningful change in teaching practice. In 2003, 4%\u00ad28% of mathematics and science teachers in public middle and high schools attended professional development programs for 33 hours or more over the course of a school year.\nTeacher Salaries, Working Conditions, and Job Satisfaction\nAttrition from teaching was typically lower than from other professions and attrition rates of mathematics and science teachers were no greater than the overall rate. Many were satisfied with being teachers and planned to stay in the profession as long as they could.\n Among all college graduates working in 1994, 34% were working in the same occupational category in 2003 and 54% had made a change in occupation. In contrast, 61% of college graduates entering K\u00ad12 teaching in 1994 were still teaching in 2003 and 21% had left teaching for nonteaching jobs.\n Between academic years 2003 and 2004, about 6%\u00ad7% of mathematics and science teachers in public schools left teaching, compared with 8% of all teachers.\n In 2003, 90% of mathematics and science teachers said that they were satisfied with being teachers in their schools, 76% planned to remain in teaching as long as they could or until retirement, and more than 66% expressed their willingness to become teachers again if they could start over.\nPublic secondary schools experienced varying degrees of difficulty in finding teachers in mathematics and science.\n About 80% of public secondary schools reported teaching vacancies (i.e., teaching positions needing to be filled) in one or more fields in academic year 2003. Among these schools, 74% had vacant positions in mathematics and 52%\u00ad56% had vacant positions in biology/life sciences and physical sciences.\n About one-third of public secondary schools with vacancies in mathematics or physical sciences reported great difficulty in finding teachers to fill openings in these\n\n\f1-6 \n\nChapter 1. Elementary and Secondary Education\n\nfields, whereas 22% of schools reported that this was the case in biology/life sciences.\nScience and mathematics teacher salaries continue to lag behind salaries for individuals working in comparable professions and the gaps have widened substantially in recent years.\n In 2003, the median salary for full-time high school mathematics and science teachers was $43,000, lower than the salaries of professionals with comparable educational backgrounds such as computer systems analysts, engineers, accountants or financial specialists, and protective service workers ($50,000\u00ad$72,000). From 1993 to 2003, full-time high school mathematics and science teachers had a real salary gain of 8%, compared with increases of 21%\u00ad29% for computer systems analysts, accountants or financial specialists, and engineers.\n In 2003, 53% of public middle and high school mathematics and science teachers said that they were not satisfied with their salaries.\nMost public school teachers had favorable perceptions of their working conditions.\n In 2003, at least 79% of mathematics and science teachers in public middle and high schools reported strong leadership from the administration in their school, a great amount of collaboration among their colleagues, and sufficient instructional materials.\n Relatively few of them viewed various student problems as \"serious\" in their schools. The problems that teachers rated most often as serious were students arriving at school unprepared to learn (37%) and student apathy (32%).\n\nTransition to Higher Education\nA majority of young people in the United States finished high school with a regular diploma or an equivalent credential.\n In 2005, 88% of 18\u00ad24-year-olds not enrolled in high school had received a high school diploma or earned an equivalent credential such as a General Equivalency Diploma (GED) certificate.\n Completion rates showed an upward trend for each racial/ ethnic group between 1975 and 2005. The rates increased faster for blacks than for whites, narrowing the gaps between the two groups. The gaps between whites and Hispanics remained wide.\n The on-time graduation rate, which measures the rates at which high school freshmen graduate with a regular diploma 4 years later, ranged from 72%\u00ad74% in the early 2000s.\nIncreasing numbers of students are entering postsecondary education directly after high school.\n Between 1975 and 2005, the percentage of students ages 16\u00ad24 enrolling in college immediately following high school graduation rose from 51% to 69%.\n Increases in rates of immediate college enrollment have occurred among all subgroups of students. However, wide gaps among these subgroups have persisted, with black and Hispanic students and those from low-income and poorly educated families trailing behind their white counterparts or those from high-income and well-educated families.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 1-7\n\nIntroduction\nThis chapter examines recent trends in student achievement and factors influencing the quality of U.S. mathematics and science education at the elementary and secondary levels. Public concern about the achievement of American students in mathematics and science has intensified in recent years. In response, the education community has developed and implemented various approaches to improving K\u00ad12 education (NSB forthcoming). Targets of reform include standards and curriculum, knowledge assessments, teacher qualification, professional development, and working conditions.\nThe chapter begins by summarizing the most recent data on U.S. student learning in mathematics and science. New indicators of achievement include changes during the first 6 years of schooling, focusing on whether gaps between groups grew over that time. Another new topic is learning from 10th to 12th grades. The achievement section also puts U.S. student performance in mathematics and science in an international context.\nThe chapter next examines high school coursetaking in mathematics and science. This edition includes new data on coursetaking in environmental science, engineering, and engineering/science technologies. It also discusses the latest information on state academic course requirements for high school graduation and the status of statewide assessments.\nTurning next to teachers, the chapter examines their qualifications, professional development, salaries, and working conditions, all issues that affect hiring and retaining professionals with backgrounds in mathematics and science. All teacher indicators in this chapter have been updated since Science and Engineering Indicators 2004 (NSB 2004), using the latest data from the 2003\u00ad04 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) and parallel data from the 1999\u00ad2000 SASS where relevant. New teacher indicators include comparisons between teacher and other professional salaries, teacher job satisfaction and plans for continuing to teach, the link between various aspects of teachers' work environments and their long-term commitment to teaching, school reports of the degree of difficulty filling teaching vacancies in mathematics and science, and comparisons of attrition among teachers and other professionals. In addition, a section on teacher professional development includes new data on content, duration, and format. The chapter closes with indicators of secondary students' transitions into higher education.\nThe chapter focuses primarily on overall patterns but also reports variations in access to educational resources by minority concentration and school poverty level, and in student performance by sex, race/ethnicity, and family characteristics.\nWhenever a difference or change over time is cited in this chapter, it is statistically significant at the 0.05 probability level.1\n\nStudent Learning in Mathematics and Science\nThis section presents indicators of student performance in mathematics and science from two types of studies: longitudinal studies and repeating cross-sectional studies. Longitudinal studies follow the same group of students over time; for example, from kindergarten through fifth grade. These studies can show achievement gains in a particular subject from grade to grade. Repeating cross-sectional studies provide a snapshot of how certain students perform in a particular year and then take another snapshot of a similar group of students in a later year; for example, comparing fourth graders in 1990 to fourth graders in 2005.\nPerformance as Students Progress Through Elementary School\nThe Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS) followed a group of students who entered kindergarten in fall 1998 until spring 2004, when most were in fifth grade.2 The 2006 volume of Science and Engineering Indicators provided data from ECLS through third grade (NSB 2006). Those indicators showed that mathematics achievement differences among subpopulations already existed when students entered kindergarten. Although all groups made gains by third grade, some gaps widened over the 4-year period (Rathbun, West, and Germino Hausken 2004). This volume updates those indicators of early mathematics learning to fifth grade. It also presents the first longitudinal data from ECLS on science learning, from third through fifth grade.\nMathematics: Fifth Grade Performance The ECLS mathematics assessments provide indica-\ntors of student proficiency in nine specific skill areas that represent a progression of skills and knowledge (see sidebar \"Mathematics Skills Areas for Elementary Grade Students\"). This volume of Science and Engineering Indicators focuses on the skill areas assessed in fifth grade, whereas the 2006 volume focused on the lower-order skill areas assessed in kindergarten through third grade.\nBy the end of fifth grade, almost all students (92%) could solve simple multiplication and division problems, and about three-quarters demonstrated understanding of place value in integers to the hundreds place (figure 1-1; appendix table 1-1) (Princiotta, Flanagan, and Germino Hausken 2006). Other topics proved more challenging, with less than half of fifth graders (43%) able to solve word problems using knowledge of measurement and rate, 13% able to solve problems using fractions, and 2% able to solve problems using area and volume. However, in each of the mathematics skills areas assessed at both time points, the percentages of students demonstrating proficiency increased since the third grade (appendix table 1-1).\n\n\f1-8 \n\nChapter 1. Elementary and Secondary Education\n\nMathematics Skill Areas for Elementary Grade Students\n\nECLS measures student proficiency at nine specific mathematics skill levels. These skill levels were identified based on frameworks from other national assessments and advice from a panel of education experts and represent a progression of mathematics skills and knowledge. Levels 6, 7, and 8 were first assessed in third grade, and level 9 was first assessed in fifth grade. By the fifth grade, levels 1 through 4 were not assessed. Each level is labeled by the most sophisticated skill in the set.\nLevel 1 Number and shape: Recognize single-digit numbers and shapes.\nLevel 2 Relative size: Count beyond 10, recognize the sequence in basic patterns, and compare the relative size and dimensional relationship of objects.\nLevel 3 Ordinality and sequence: Recognize two-digit numbers, identify the next number in a sequence, identify the ordinal position of an object, and solve simple word problems.\n\nLevel 4 Add and subtract: Solve simple addition and subtraction items and identify relationships of numbers in sequence.\nLevel 5 Multiply and divide: Perform basic multiplication and division and recognize more complex number patterns.\nLevel 6 Place value: Demonstrate understanding of place value in integers to the hundreds place.\nLevel 7 Rate and measurement: Use knowledge of measurement and rate to solve word problems.\nLevel 8 Fractions: Solve problems using fractions.\nLevel 9 Area and volume: Solve problems using area and volume.\nSources: Princiotta, Flanagan, and Germino Hausken 2006; West, Denton, and Reaney 2000.\n\nFigure 1-1 Proficiency in specific mathematics knowledge and skill areas of students in grades 3 and 5: 2002 and 2004\nPercent\n100\n\nIncreasing difficulty 80\n\nGrade 3\n\nGrade 5\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0 Multiplication and division\n\nPlace value\n\nRate and measurement\n\nFractions\n\nNA Area and volume\n\nNA = not available\nNOTES: In 2004 followup for Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS) kindergarten class of fall 1998, 86% of cohort was in grade 5, 14% was in lower grade, and <1% was in higher grade. For simplicity, students in ECLS followups referred to by modal and expected grade, i.e., third graders in spring 2002 assessment and fifth graders in spring 2004 assessment.\nSOURCES: National Center for Education Statistics, ECLS, spring 2002 and 2004; and National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, special tabulations. See appendix table 1-1.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nMathematics: Achievement Gaps During Elementary School\nFifth grade mathematics performance was related to several student background factors (Princiotta, Flanagan, and Germino Hausken 2006). For each of the mathematics skill levels mentioned above, lower proportions of black and Hispanic students were proficient compared with their white and Asian peers (appendix table 1-1). Students whose mothers had less formal education and students who were living\n\nin poverty3 also generally demonstrated lower proficiency rates than their peers.\nAlthough many of these mathematics achievement differences were evident when these children started kindergarten, the ECLS data suggest that at least some gaps widened as students progressed through elementary school, and that other gaps, such as those between boys and girls, emerged that were not present when students started school (Princiotta, Flanagan, and Germino Hausken 2006; Rathbun, West, and\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 1-9\n\nGermino Hausken 2004). Changes in achievement gaps are most easily summarized by examining average scale scores, which place students on a continuous ability scale based on their overall performance. Results indicate that all demographic groups gain mathematical skills and knowledge during elementary school but the rate of progress varies.\nGender Gaps. Boys and girls started kindergarten at the same overall mathematics performance level (appendix table 1-2), but by the end of fifth grade, boys had made larger mathematics gains than girls, resulting in a small but observable gender gap of four points.\nRace/Ethnicity Gaps. Gaps between white and black students and between white and Hispanic students existed when students started kindergarten and they widened over time. In mathematics, from kindergarten to fifth grade, white students posted a gain of 93 points; Hispanics, a gain of 89 points; and blacks, a gain of 80 points (table 1-1; appendix table 1-2). By fifth grade, the gap between white and black students in average mathematics scores was 19 points, and the average score of black fifth grade students was equivalent to the average third grade score of white students.\nMother's Education and Family Income Gaps. Students whose mothers had higher levels of education entered kindergarten with higher average mathematics scores than their peers whose mothers attained less formal education and these gaps increased as students progressed through elementary school (appendix table 1-2). By grade 5, the gaps in mathematics scores were substantial, with students whose mothers had dropped out of high school posting a lower average mathematics score than students whose mothers had graduated from college had posted at grade 3. Students living in families with incomes below the poverty threshold also entered school with lower mathematics skills than their peers from higher income families, and those discrepancies in scores grew by fifth grade.\n\nOther research suggests that widening achievement gaps as students progress through school are, at least in part, a result of differential learning growth and loss during the summer (Alexander, Entwisle, and Olson 2001; Borman and Boulay 2004; Cooper et al. 1996). For example, although lower- and upper-income primary grade students made similar gains in mathematics during the school year, lower-income students experienced declines in mathematics skills during summer breaks, whereas higher-income students experienced gains (Alexander, Entwisle, and Olson 2001). These findings have been attributed to greater ability among higher-income parents to provide their children with mathematically stimulating materials and activities during the summer.\nScience: Performance Gains and Gaps From Third to Fifth Grade\nECLS began assessing students in science in the third grade and tested those students' science knowledge again in fifth grade (Princiotta, Flanagan, and Germino Hausken 2006; Rathbun, West, and Germino Hausken 2004). The science assessments placed equal emphasis on life science, earth and space science, and physical science, asking students to demonstrate understanding of the physical and natural world, make inferences, and understand relationships. Assessments also required students to interpret scientific data, form hypotheses, and develop plans to investigate scientific questions. ECLS science assessments were not designed to measure proficiency in specific skill areas and therefore do not lend themselves to proficiency levels; results are instead summarized by average scale scores.\nGains in science skills and knowledge between third and fifth grade were seen across each demographic group, but performance gaps persisted (appendix table 1-3). Gaps were evident the first time students were assessed in science, in third grade. Boys had slightly higher average science scores\n\nTable 1-1 Average mathematics scores of students from beginning kindergarten to grade 5, by race/ethnicity: 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2004\n\nRace/ethnicity\n\nFall 1998 kindergarten\n\nSpring 2000 grade 1\n\nSpring 2002 grade 3\n\nSpring 2004 grade 5\n\nGain from kindergarten\nto grade 5\n\nAll students..........................................................................\n\n22\n\n39\n\n91\n\n112\n\n89\n\nWhite, non-Hispanic ........................................................\n\n25\n\n43\n\n97\n\n118\n\n93\n\nBlack, non-Hispanic ........................................................\n\n19\n\n33\n\n79\n\n99\n\n80\n\nHispanic...........................................................................\n\n19\n\n36\n\n85\n\n108\n\n89\n\nAsian ................................................................................\n\n25\n\n39\n\n94\n\n118\n\n93\n\nOthera ..............................................................................\n\n20\n\n38\n\n86\n\n107\n\n86\n\naIncludes non-Hispanic Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, American Indians, Alaska Natives, and children of more than one race.\n\nNOTES: Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey (ECLS) mathematics scale ranged from 0 to 153.

Elementary and Secondary Education\n\nthan girls and they maintained this small difference in performance in fifth grade. In third grade, white and Asian students had higher average science scores than did blacks and Hispanics, and Hispanics outperformed their black peers. By fifth grade, none of these gaps had narrowed and the black-Hispanic gap had increased. The average score for black fifth graders was lower than the average score for white third graders.\nThird graders whose mothers had more formal education performed better in science than did their peers with mothers who were less educated, and students who lived above the poverty threshold did better in science than those who lived below it (appendix table 1-3). By fifth grade these gaps in science performance by mothers' education and poverty status either remained constant or grew wider. Students from families below the poverty threshold had average fifth grade science scores equivalent to the third grade scores of students above the poverty threshold.\nMathematics Performance as Students Progress Through High School\nAnother longitudinal study, the Education Longitudinal Study (ELS), provides indicators of student learning during high school by following a nationally representative sample of students who were in 10th grade in 2002 (NCES 2007a). These students were assessed again in 2004 in 12th grade. ELS includes an assessment of student performance in mathematics, which provides information both on specific skills and on overall mathematics performance. The specific skills are divided into levels representing a progression of mathematics skills: (1) simple arithmetical operations with whole numbers; (2) simple operations with decimals, fractions, powers, and roots; (3) simple problem solving requiring the understanding of low-level mathematical concepts; (4) understanding of intermediate-level mathematical concepts\n\nand multistep solutions to word problems; and (5) complex multistep word problems and advanced mathematics material (NCES 2007a).\nIn 2004, almost all 12th grade students (96%) were proficient in simple arithmetical operations with whole numbers and 79% were also proficient in simple operations with decimals, fractions, roots, and powers (figure 1-2; appendix table 1-4). However, the proportions demonstrating proficiency in more advanced mathematics skills were lower and decreased as more advanced skills were tested. Only 4% of 12th grade students reached proficiency at the highest level (solving complex multistep word problems). Nevertheless, at each level, the percentages of students demonstrating proficiency increased from the 10th to the 12th grade.\nEach demographic subgroup examined improved in mathematics skills from 10th to 12th grade, but achievement disparities were evident. The ECLS data reviewed in the previous section found that boys and girls entered kindergarten with similar overall mathematics performance, but by the fifth grade, boys demonstrated slightly higher performance. This small gender gap favoring boys was also observed in the 10th and 12th grades in ELS, with the gap holding steady between those 2 years (appendix table 1-4).\nSubstantial differences among racial/ethnic groups were found in mathematics achievement at grade 10, with white and Asian/Pacific Islander students posting higher average scores than black and Hispanic students, and Hispanic students scoring slightly higher than black students (appendix table 1-4). After 2 additional years of schooling, whiteHispanic and Hispanic-black gaps held steady, and the whiteblack, Asian-black, and Asian-Hispanic gaps increased. By 12th grade, the average performance of black students was slightly lower than the average 10th grade performance of white and Asian students.\n\nFigure 1-2 Proficiency in specific mathematics knowledge and skill areas of students in grades 10 and 12: 2002 and 2004\nPercent\n100\n\nIncreasing difficulty 80\n\nGrade 10\n\nGrade 12\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0 Simple arithmetic\noperations on whole numbers\n\nSimple arithmetic operations with\ndecimals\n\nSimple problem solving\n\nUnderstanding of intermediate-level\nmath concepts\n\nSolving complex multistep word\nproblems\n\nSOURCES: National Center for Education Statistics, Education Longitudinal Study, spring 2002 and 2004; and National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, special tabulations.

These differences generally increased through the 12th grade. Students from low socioeconomic families4 had lower average 10th grade mathematics scores than their peers in middle socioeconomic families, who in turn had lower scores than students in high socioeconomic families. By 12th grade these gaps had grown.\nPerformance of 4th, 8th, and 12th Grade Students Since the 1990s\nThe two longitudinal studies described above showed that students start school with different levels of knowledge and skills and that some of those differences grow as the same students move through the educational system. Notably, none of the achievement gaps reviewed above between historically privileged and underprivileged groups narrowed during elementary or high school.\nAnother type of assessment, a well-known repeating cross-sectional study, provided indicators that showed a somewhat more positive trend. As will be detailed below, fourth and eighth grade students in 2005 (including most subgroups) performed better on mathematics tests on average than fourth and eighth graders a decade and a half earlier. However, fewer gains were observed in science and substantial achievement gaps among subgroups of students in these grades persisted in both mathematics and science.\nThe National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), also known as the \"Nation's Report Card,\" has charted the academic performance of U.S. students in the upper elementary and secondary grades since 1969. Previous Science and Engineering Indicators reports described trends in mathematics and science results dating back to the first NAEP assessments.5 This volume focuses on more recent trends, from 1990 to 2005 for mathematics (grades 4 and 8) and from 1996 to 2005 for science (grades 4, 8, and 12) (NCES 2006a, b). Twelfth graders were assessed in mathematics in 2005 but the assessment was not comparable with previous NAEP assessments, and therefore trend data are not available for grade 12 mathematics.6\nThe NAEP assessments are based on frameworks developed through a national consensus process that involves educators, policymakers, assessment and curriculum experts, and the public. The frameworks are then approved by the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) (NCES 2006a, 2007b). The mathematics grades 4 and 8 assessments contain five broad content strands (number sense, properties, and operations; measurement; geometry and spatial sense; data analysis, statistics and probability; and algebra and functions). The mathematics grade 12 assessment contains four content strands that are similar to the grade 4 and 8 strands, but with measurement and geometry collapsed together. The science framework includes a\n\ncontent dimension divided into three major fields of science: earth, life, and physical.\nStudent performance on the NAEP is measured with scale scores as well as achievement levels. Scale scores place students on a continuous ability scale based on their overall performance. For grades 4 and 8, the mathematics scales range from 0 to 500 across the two grades. For grade 12, the mathematics scale ranges from 0 to 300. For science, the scales range from 0 to 300 for each of the three grades.\nAchievement levels are set by NAGB based on recommendations from panels of educators and members of the public, and describe what students should know and be able to do at the basic, proficient, and advanced levels for each grade (NCES 2006b and 2007b). The basic level represents partial mastery, proficient represents solid academic performance, and advanced represents superior performance on assessments measuring mastery of knowledge and skills for each grade level. This review of NAEP results focuses on the percentage of students deemed proficient (for more detailed definitions of the proficient levels, see Science and Engineering Indicators 2006, pp. 1\u00ad13 and 1\u00ad14 [NSB 2006 and NCES 2007b]).\nDisagreement exists about whether NAEP has appropriately defined these levels. A study commissioned by the National Academy of Sciences judged the process used to set these levels \"fundamentally flawed\" (Pellegrino, Jones, and Mitchell 1998), and NAGB acknowledges that considerable controversy remains over setting achievement levels (Bourque and Byrd 2000). However, both the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and NAGB believe the levels are useful for understanding trends in achievement. They warn readers to use and interpret the levels with caution (NCES 2006b).\nIn this section, NAEP results are examined in various ways, including changes in average scale scores and in the proportion of students reaching the proficient level both overall and among various subgroups of students. In addition, achievement gaps between demographic subpopulations and changes in those gaps are reviewed.\nExamining a set of measures reveals more about student performance than does examining just one measure (Barton 2004). For example, without examining changes in achievement for high-, middle-, and low-achieving students, it would be impossible to know whether a rise in average scores resulted from increased scores among one or a few groups of students, or whether it reflected broader improvements.\nMathematics Performance From 1990 to 2005 The average mathematics scores of fourth and eighth\ngrade students have steadily increased since 1990 (the first year in which the current assessment was given), including small improvements during the more recent period 2003\u00ad05 (NCES 2006a) (figure 1-3; table 1-2; appendix table 1-5). The pattern of higher average mathematics scores among fourth and eighth grade students was widespread (table 1-2; appendix table 1-5). At grades 4 and 8, average mathemat-\n\n\f1-12 \n\nChapter 1.

See appendix table 1-5.\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nics scores were higher for both male and female students in 2005 compared with both 1990 and 2003. This was also true for students regardless of eligibility for free or reduced-price lunch (a commonly used measure of poverty).7 Generally, improvements were observed for white, black, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander populations.8\nExamining trends for students at the lower, middle, and higher ranges of performance can uncover whether overall trends are driven by changes in only one or two of these groups. However, NAEP mathematics results indicate that the overall increase in mathematics performance was not driven by students at any one performance level (table 1-2; appendix table 1-5). Average scores for students in the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles in 2005 were all higher than those recorded in 1990 and 2003, providing evidence that gains in mathematics were widespread. (Percentiles are\n\nscores below which a specified percentage of the population falls. For example, among eighth graders in 2005, the 75th percentile score for mathematics was 304. This means that 75% of eighth graders had mathematics scores at or below 304, and 25% scored above 304).\nThe percentage of students reaching the proficient level for their grade also rose (figure 1-4; appendix table 1-6). In 1990, 13% of fourth graders were deemed proficient in mathematics compared with 36% in 2005. Among eighth graders the percentage increased from 15% to 30%.\nMathematics Performance From 2005 to 2007 The NAEP 2007 fourth and eighth grade mathematics as-\nsessment results were released too late to incorporate more than a brief summary in this volume.

Improvements occurred across all performance percentiles and income levels in both grades. Among fourth graders, scores increased for whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians/Pacific Islanders but no significant increase could be reported for American Indians/Alaska Natives because of insufficient sample size. Among eighth graders, whites, blacks, and Hispanic students improved their scores but Asians/Pacific Islanders and American Indians/Alaska Natives registered no gain. The percentage of students scoring at or above proficient in both grades increased from 36% to 39% among fourth graders and 30% to 32% among eighth graders.\nAlthough most groups showed improved performance from 2005 to 2007, performance gaps were resistant to improvement. In the fourth grade, the white-black and whiteHispanic gaps did not change between 2005 and 2007. In the eighth grade, the white-black gap decreased but the whiteHispanic gap remained about the same.\nScience Performance From 1996 to 2005 Since 1996, the first year the current NAEP science as-\nsessment was given, average scores increased for 4th graders, held steady for 8th graders, and declined for 12th graders (table 1-3, appendix table 1-7) (NCES 2006b). Trends in percentile scores suggest the increase in average scores at grade 4 was driven by lower- and middle-performing students: scores at the 10th, 25th, and 50th percentiles increased in\n\nFigure 1-4 Proficiency in mathematics and science, grades 4, 8, and 12: Selected years, 1990\u00ad2005\n\nPercent\n\n60\n\n1990\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0 Grade 4\n\nGrade 8 Mathematics\n\n60\n\n1996\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n40\n\nNA NA Grade 12\n\n20\n\n0 Grade 4\n\nGrade 8 Science\n\nGrade 12\n\nNA = not available\nNOTE: 2005 grade 12 mathematics assessment not comparable with previous assessments; therefore mathematics trend information for grade 12 not available.\nSOURCES: National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), The Nation's Report Card: Mathematics 2005, NCES 2006-453 (2006); The Nation's Report Card: Science 2005, NCES 2006-466 (2006); and National Assessment of Educational Progress, 1990, 1996, 2003, and 2005 mathematics assessments and 1996, 2000, and 2005 science assessments.

In 2005, 29% of fourth and eighth grade students reached the proficient level. Rates were lower among 12th graders (18% scored at or above the proficient level).\nChanges in Achievement Gaps Since the 1990s The longitudinal studies outlined in the beginning of this\nchapter reveal racial/ethnic gaps in mathematics and science performance as students start kindergarten, some of which grow as students progress through elementary and high school. NAEP, with snapshots of three grades over time, paints a slightly different picture. Since 1990, the white-black gap in mathematics achievement decreased among fourth graders and held steady for eighth graders (table 1-2; appendix table 1-5). The white-Hispanic mathematic gaps held steady over this time for students in grades 4 and 8. In science, fourth grade black students narrowed the achievement gap with white students from 1996 to 2005 (table 1-3; appendix table 1-7). Despite some narrowing, substantial racial/ethnic gaps\n\n\f1-14 \n\nChapter 1.

See appendix table 1-7.\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nin mathematics and science remained. For example, among 12th grade students in 2005, 24% of white students and 23% of Asian/Pacific Islander students were proficient in science compared with 13% of American Indian/Alaska Native students, 5% of Hispanic students, and 2% of black students (appendix table 1-8). Although grade 12 trends are not available for mathematics, the 2005 data reveal substantial racial/ethnic gaps in this subject as well: 36% of Asian/Pacific Islander 12th graders, 29% of white 12th graders, 8% of Hispanic 12th graders, and 6% each of black and American Indian/Alaska Native 12th graders reached the proficient level in mathematics (appendix table 1-6).\nIn 2005, boys in grades 4, 8, and 12 performed slightly better than girls in both mathematics and science (appendix tables 1-5, 1-6, 1-7, and 1-8). These small gender gaps have remained stable since 1990 in mathematics (for grades 4 and 8) and 1996 in science (for grades 4, 8, and 12). In 2005, students in grades 4 and 8 who were eligible for the federal subsidized lunch program had lower average mathematics scores than their peers who were not eligible (appendix table\n\n1-5). However, the grade 4 gap with regard to subsidized lunch was slightly less in 2005 than it had been in 1996 (table 1-2; appendix table 1-5). Achievement differences with regard to subsidized lunch eligibility were also found in science, with fourth and eighth grade students eligible for the lunch program performing below their ineligible peers (appendix table 1-7). Between 2000 and 2005, these science gaps by subsidized lunch eligibility in grades 4 and 8 decreased somewhat (table 1-3; appendix table 1-7).\nInternational Comparisons of Mathematics and Science Performance\nTwo assessments help compare mathematics and science performance in the United States to other countries: the Trends in International Mathematics and Sciences Study (TIMSS) and the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). Results from the most recent administration of these assessments are included in more detail in Science and Engineering Indicators 2006 and are only summarized here.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 1-15\n\nIn 2003, U.S. students scored above international averages on the TIMSS assessment and below international averages on the PISA assessment, differences that may be explained, in part, by each test's focus and the set of countries participating in each assessment (Neidorf et al. forthcoming). TIMSS tests primary and middle grade students on curriculum-based knowledge and skills. PISA tests 15-yearolds on their ability to apply scientific and mathematical concepts and thinking skills to real-world problems. Although TIMSS includes results from 46 industrialized and developing countries, PISA results reported here include 30 countries, all of which are industrialized.\nAccording to TIMSS data, U.S. fourth and eighth graders performed above the international average in mathematics and science in 2003 (Gonzales et al. 2004). However, because TIMSS includes many developing countries in its international average, it also can be helpful to compare U.S. performance to two similarly industrialized countries, the United Kingdom and Japan. Japan outperformed U.S. fourth and eighth graders in both mathematics and science. The United Kingdom outperformed U.S. fourth graders in both\n\nsubjects, but had insufficient numbers participating in eighth grade to make a comparison. According to PISA results, U.S. 15-year-olds performed below the average for industrialized countries in both mathematics and science (Lemke et al. 2004). Of 30 participating industrialized nations, 20 outperformed the United States in mathematics and 15 outperformed it in science (see sidebar \"Achievement Negatively Correlated With Confidence in Learning Across Countries/ Economies\").\nSummary\nTwo national longitudinal studies found that students enter kindergarten with varied mathematics knowledge and skills, and all groups made gains during elementary and high school but at different rates. The result is that most mathematics achievement gaps remain, or have grown, by the time students graduate from high school. The national longitudinal data for science report achievement gaps in third grade (the first time students are assessed) and gains among all groups from third to fifth grade, but also no narrowing\n\nAchievement Negatively Correlated With Confidence in Learning Across\nCountries/Economies\nTIMSS measured a concept less frequently reported with standardized test results: whether students are selfconfident in learning. Correlating achievement with selfconfidence reveals surprising results. When comparing mathematics score averages across countries/economies, those with higher percentages of students reporting higher confidence in learning mathematics scored lower than countries/economies with lower percentages of students reporting such confidence (Loveless 2006; Mullis et al. 2004).\nOn eighth grade mathematics assessments, 39% of U.S. students reported that they usually do well in mathematics, compared with 4% in Japan (table 1-4). However, the average national test score for the United States was 66 points lower than Japan's. Within a given country, however, students who were more self-confident in learning did score higher than other students in their country (Loveless 2006).\n\nTable 1-4 Eighth-grader's confidence in mathematics, by mathematics achievement score and country/ economy: 2003\n\nCountry/economy\n\nStudents who\n\n\"agree a lot\" Average\n\n(%)\n\nscore\n\nScore above international average\n\nJordan ............................\n\n48\n\n424\n\nEgypt ..............................\n\n46\n\n406\n\nIsrael ...............................\n\n43\n\n496\n\nx\n\nGhana .............................\n\n41\n\n276\n\nBahrain ...........................\n\n40\n\n401\n\nTunisia ............................\n\n39\n\n410\n\nCyprus ............................\n\n39\n\n459\n\nPalestinian Authority ........\n\n39\n\n390\n\nUnited States..................\n\n39\n\n504\n\nx\n\nSouth Africa....................\n\n38\n\n264\n\nInternational average........\n\n27\n\n467\n\nRomania .........................\n\n18\n\n475\n\nx\n\nSingapore .......................\n\n18\n\n605\n\nx\n\nLatvia ..............................\n\n17\n\n508\n\nx\n\nMoldova ..........................\n\n17\n\n460\n\nNetherlands ....................\n\n16\n\n536\n\nx\n\nMalaysia .........................\n\n13\n\n508\n\nx\n\nChinese Taipei ................\n\n11\n\n585\n\nx\n\nHong Kong .....................\n\n10\n\n586\n\nx\n\nKorea ..............................\n\n5\n\n589\n\nx\n\nJapan ..............................\n\n4\n\n570\n\nx\n\nNOTE: Countries/economies ranked by percentage of students who \"agree a lot\" that I usually do well in mathematics.\n\nSOURCES: Loveless T, How Well are American Students Learning?

In 2005, students in grades 4 and 8 posted higher mathematics scores than students in those same grades in 1990. The pattern of higher scores was widespread, occurring among males and females, across racial/ethnic groups, for students from financially advantaged and disadvantaged families, and for students in the lower, middle, and higher ranges of performance. Additionally, some achievement gaps narrowed. In science, average scores increased for fourth grade students, held steady for eighth graders, and declined for 12th graders between 1996 (the first year the assessments were given) and 2005. Trends in percentile scores suggest the increase in overall science scores of fourth graders were driven by improved scores among lower- and middle-performing students.\nDespite the gains made in mathematics (and to a lesser extent, science) from the 1990s to 2005, most 4th, 8th, and 12th graders do not perform at levels considered proficient for their grade. Just more than one-third of fourth graders reached the proficient level in mathematics in 2005, and the rates were lower for mathematics at grades 8 and 12, and at all three grades for science. International comparisons of student mathematics and science performance indicate U.S. students perform below average in mathematics and science for industrialized countries.\nStandards and Student Coursetaking\nStandards provide a foundation of support for other key components of any educational accountability system, for example, courses and curriculum, teacher skills and professional development, and assessments. In the face of generally flat performance trends in the upper high school grades even after curricular standards were raised over the past two decades,9 policymakers and educators are seeking new ways to revise standards and courses to help effectively educate young people (Achieve, Inc. 2004; Achieve, Inc., and National Governors Association 2005; Hurst et al. 2003). Currently, revisions focus on adding specific college-preparatory requirements and on making high school standards congruent with the expectations of colleges and employers by involving their representatives in the revision process.\nThe courses that students take, along with the curricula and teaching methods used, strongly influence what they learn and how well they are able to apply that learning. Research has linked completing more challenging courses with stronger academic performance, and coursework may play a direct role in increasing student achievement (Bozick, Ingels, and Daniel 2007; Chaney, Burgdorf, and Atash 1997; Lee, Croninger, and Smith 1997; and Schmidt et al. 2001). In their 1990 study, Bryk, Lee, and Smith concluded that coursetaking was the \"principal determinant of achievement.\"\n\nChapter 1. Elementary and Secondary Education\nLinks Between Coursetaking and Learning\nResearchers have uncovered an association between courses completed and achievement scores, but not all have controlled for student ability. Students with strong academic skills are likely to take more challenging courses, but if they learn more than other students over time, researchers would like to know how much of the additional gain is attributable to skill and how much to coursework.\nTwo recent studies that applied controls for ability are described here. Using data from students who took its college entrance exams in 2004, an ACT study found that students who completed a recommended core curriculum scored higher on the ACT tests, regardless of sex, race/ethnicity, family income, or ability (ACT 2006). ACT defined that core curriculum as 3 years each of mathematics, science, and social studies and 4 years of English. Taking advanced courses beyond the core requirements, including additional courses in mathematics and science, was linked to larger score gains, even after controlling for students' prior achievement. Completing the core curriculum also led to higher rates of college enrollment and success in first-year courses like college algebra. Core curriculum graduates were also more likely to be prepared for further workforce training, according to tests of applied learning.\nIn another study, Bozick, Ingels, and Daniel (2007) used student 10th-grade mathematics proficiency scores as one control measure in examining associations between the mathematics courses taken in 11th and 12th grades and test score gains from 10th to 12th grades. The analysis found that mathematics achievement test scores in 12th grade and achievement gains from 10th to 12th grades were positively related to student mathematics course sequences during the last 2 years of high school. The largest overall gains, and the greatest gains in advanced skills such as derivations and making inferences from algebraic expressions, were made by students who took precalculus in 11th grade plus an additional mathematics course in 12th grade (in most cases, calculus). The largest gains in intermediate skills (such as simple operations and problem solving) were made by those who followed the geometry/algebra II sequence. The smallest gains were made by students who took one mathematics course or no mathematics courses during their last 2 years of secondary school. The analyses controlled for students' prior skill levels and demographic characteristics, including socioeconomic status, educational aspirations, family composition, and school sector.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 1-17\n\nThis section presents several indicators of standards and coursetaking, including increases in state academic course requirements for high school graduation and revisions of content standards. In addition, high school course completion trends are shown from 1990 through 2005 for advanced mathematics, science, and engineering, as well as for engineering/science technologies, which are generally not considered advanced courses. The section concludes by examining course completion rates for 2005 graduates with various characteristics.\nState Coursetaking and Curriculum Standards\nCompleting advanced courses in high school, particularly in mathematics, not only contributes to increased learning, but also predicts college enrollment and degree completion (Adelman 1999, 2006; Rose and Betts 2001). Students who complete such courses increase their college acceptance chances, are better prepared for college study, and have a higher likelihood of earning a bachelor's degree (see sidebar \"Links Between Coursetaking and Learning\"). However, a recent American College Test (ACT) report (2006) found that close to half of students who planned to attend college had not completed the academic courses necessary to enroll in credit-bearing college courses. Raising course requirements for graduation provides one method of bridging such gaps in preparation; if preparation is strengthened, not only would college completion rates increase, but many students also would earn degrees more quickly and college remediation costs would decline.\nFurthermore, studying high-level mathematics in secondary school, particularly calculus, may increase the likelihood of choosing a mathematics or science major in college (Federman 2007). After adjusting for ability and course\n\npreferences, Federman found that the number of high school mathematics courses completed was positively related to propensity to major in a technical field, including all science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and some high-level medical fields. Mathematics coursetaking as a stepping stone into such fields may be especially applicable to young women (Trusty 2002). Completing a range of advanced mathematics courses in high school was associated with women's majoring in mathematics and science subjects at higher rates. However, for men, high school physics was the only predictor for majoring in mathematics or science in college.10 Increasing course completions in advanced mathematics and science may therefore help enlarge the college graduate pool and the workforce in these fields as well as increase women's participation in occupations in which they have been traditionally underrepresented.\nCore Subject Requirements In 2006, 3 years was the most common state requirement\nfor both mathematics (26 states) and science (27 states) courses for high school graduation. In 12 states, the mathematics requirement was two or fewer years and 16 states required 2 or fewer years or science. The shift from a predominant requirement of 2 years in each subject in the mid1980s is notable (table 1-5). Few states (six for mathematics and one for science) required 4 years of study in these subjects, and one state required 4 years in both.\nSix states left course requirements up to local districts, whose standards apply to all high school students in the district. In practice, districts generally require the courses that students need for admission to the state's public universities. Therefore, these states may not differ substantially from those with published statewide requirements. (Districts may also add requirements above state minimums.)\n\nTable 1-5 States requiring various years of mathematics and science study for high school graduation: 1987, 1996, and 2006\n\nMathematics\n\nScience\n\nState/local standard\n\n1987\n\n1996\n\n2006\n\n1987\n\n1996\n\n2006\n\nLocal decision ..........................................\n\n6\n\n7\n\n6\n\n6\n\n7\n\n6\n\n1\u00ad2 yearsa ................................................. 33\n\n26\n\n12\n\n40\n\n33\n\n16\n\n3 years...................................................... 10\n\n15\n\n26\n\n3\n\n8\n\n27\n\n4 years ......................................................\n\n0\n\n2\n\n6\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1\n\naIn 2006, all states with statewide requirements required 2 years of mathematics courses, and only one state required 1 year of science.\n\nNOTES: Data included for all states for 2006 and for all states plus District of Columbia for years before 2006, with two exceptions: in 1987, Arkansas and Vermont required total of 5 mathematics and science credits (2 or 3 credits in each) so not assigned to a category; in 1996, Vermont alone not counted for this reason. Some states had separate requirements for different kinds of diplomas. For these, states categorized by requirements for \"standard\" diploma or for type most students likely receive, if more than one type and none called standard. In some states and some years, a new requirement enacted by year in column head but did not necessarily apply to graduating class of that year.\n\nSOURCES: Council of Chief State School Officers, Key State Education Policies on PK-12 Education: 2006 (2007); and National Center for Education Statistics, Digest of Education Statistics, 1988 and 1998 editions (1988 and 1999).\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\f1-18 \n\nChapter 1. Elementary and Secondary Education\n\nRising standards have increased the number of required academic courses since the mid-1980s. In the past decade or so, the policy focus has expanded to include listing specific courses that must be completed and improving course content. A primary goal of adding requirements for more mathematics and science study is to direct students into more challenging courses, particularly those intended to prepare them for success in college. To that end, in 2006, 21 states required completion of specific mathematics courses (with algebra the most common) and 22 states required specific science courses (most often biology) (CCSSO 2007). Nearly all states that required specific courses in mathematics also required them in science. Another five states required students to complete a science course with laboratory work but required no specific course.\n\nCourse Content Standards and Testing In addition to specifying key courses that must be com-\npleted, states have developed and applied new standards for course content. All states had adopted content standards in mathematics and science by 2006\u00ad07, and 35 states had schedules for reviewing and revising those standards (Editorial Projects in Education 2007).\nIn light of continuing dissatisfaction on the part of employers and college professors with high school graduates' skill levels (see sidebar \"Attitudes of Parents, Students, and School Staff Toward Standards\") and the overall lack of substantial achievement gains for 12th graders on national and international tests, some policymakers want additional standards revisions and are seeking input from stakeholders outside of K\u00ad12 education. Reforms are intended to address the primary problems that critics lodge against standards: they are vague and lack focus, they cover too much and thus cause teachers\n\nAttitudes of Parents, Students, and School Staff Toward Standards\n\nProminent business and education organizations have continued to underscore the need for high schools to raise standards so that students will gain the skills and knowledge base required by employers and postsecondary institutions. Among these organizations are the Gates Foundation and the American Diploma Project (ADP), a consortium that includes Achieve, Inc., many state leaders, the Education Trust, and the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation. In addition, majorities of employers and professors surveyed in 1998\u00ad2002 reported that many or most high school graduates (depending on the specific question) lacked skills needed for successful job performance and course completion. For example, in 2001 nearly two-thirds of both groups thought that graduates' basic mathematics skills were fair or poor, and 73%\u00ad75% rated student writing ability fair or poor (Public Agenda 2002).\nHowever, these views contrast with those of parents and students. A 2006 survey of parents and students in public school grades 6\u00ad12 showed that most do not believe that their local schools need much improvement or that more mathematics and science instruction is necessary. For example, 32% of parents thought their child's school should be teaching more mathematics and science, whereas 57% thought the current amounts were fine (Public Agenda 2006). At 70%, parents of high school students were the most likely (compared with parents of younger students) to think that no increases were needed. Concern about this issue has decreased since 1994, when 52% of parents identified not learning enough mathematics and science as a serious problem, compared with 32% in 2006. This change may partly reflect increases over time in student coursetaking in these subjects.\nOn academic standards, students in grades 6\u00ad12 also expressed some complacency. Only 35% thought it was a\n\nproblem at their school that \"academic standards are too low and kids are not expected to learn enough,\" and it was not a high priority among 13 problems rated by students. More were concerned about fellow students lacking respect and using bad language, cheating, skipping school/classes, and \"too much pressure to make good grades.\" Even fewer parents (15%) identified \"low academic standards and outdated curricula\" as a source of the most pressing problems in schools (in a question with different wording).\nActive support from school leaders and teachers is also necessary for reforms to be effective. However, many educators (particularly leaders) do not agree that schools need to raise standards or enact other fundamental reforms. Nearly 80% of both principals and superintendents called it \"not a serious problem\" that academic standards were too low and students were not expected to learn enough. On a related question, 93% of superintendents and 80% of principals evaluated current educational quality as better than the education they received.\nMost parents rated their children's public schools highly in 2006. The majority believed that when their children graduate from high school they will have the skills needed for employment or success in college (61% and 69%, respectively). Nearly two-thirds (65%) of parents said that their children were learning more difficult material in school than they had in their school days, and 61% thought their children's schooling was better than their own at that age. Despite their satisfaction with schools overall, parents of different income levels tended to have divergent opinions. For example, over half of low-income parents in a 2002 survey (56%) worried a lot about the low quality of public schools, compared with just 38% of high-income parents (Public Agenda 2002).\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 1-19\n\nto rush through material, and they differ widely across states (Peterson and Hess 2006; Ravitch 2006; Smith 2006).\nDisagreement also exists about whether a single set of standards should apply to all students regardless of their intention to attend college after high school. Whereas standards defining college readiness generally include specific courses, standards for work readiness instead tend to focus on skills, including those specific to a career or industry and broader skills required for any job (Lloyd 2007).\nIn 2006 the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) called for greater classroom focus on fewer highpriority \"focal points\" and provided a limited number of specific skill goals for each grade level (NCTM 2006). Similarly, a committee of the National Research Council (NRC) recently urged educators to place continued emphasis on a few fundamental concepts over a span of many grades, and to introduce more complex material related to these concepts as students mature (NRC 2007). Such strategies enable students to develop a deeper understanding of the concepts over time. These recommendations build on curriculum standards documents published earlier by NCTM (2000), the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1993), and NRC (1996).\nDespite years of work on standards, a substantial gap still exists in most states between the skills and knowledge required for high school graduation and those needed for college study and work (Achieve, Inc. 2007; Cohen et al. 2006). Efforts to bridge these gaps state by state include the High School Honor States program, which is sponsored by the National Governors Association (NGA), and the American Diploma Project (ADP).\nThe Honor States program awards grants to states to improve high schools by revamping standards and taking other related actions under NGA leadership (NGA 2007). Funds support developing exemplary practices using NGA's guidelines, and NGA disseminates findings to policymakers in other states. One primary goal is to align state standards at all school levels, including postsecondary, so that students are prepared to succeed in college courses and the workplace after they graduate from high school. Among promising practices noted so far in the Honor States program is providing financial incentives to support coordination between secondary and postsecondary educators. A practical example of collaboration between these sectors is administering college placement tests in high school to make college academic expectations clear to students. Also, some states have implemented broad media campaigns to raise students' and others' awareness of the need to prepare adequately for college and work.\nThe ADP initiative, sharing the Honor States program goals, provides technical assistance to help educators raise standards and increase consistency across districts. Tracking progress toward aligned standards requires developing and using data systems that follow students from kindergarten or pre-K through their college years. State education agency staff were working in 29 states in 2006 with leaders from elementary, secondary, and postsecondary education (including representatives of the American Council on Education,\n\nthe National Association of System Heads, and State Higher Education Executive Officers) and business leaders to upgrade curriculum standards. Once in place, such \"real-world standards\" would help students choose courses and guide them to expend sufficient effort in high school, reducing the need for remedial courses in college (Achieve, Inc. 2007) (see sidebar \"The State of State Assessments\").\nIn 2006, 12 states surveyed by Achieve had curriculum standards in place that met ADP's college- and work-readiness benchmarks for both mathematics and English curricula (Achieve, Inc. 2007; Cohen et al. 2006). In addition, 27 more states were working to align graduation requirements with these benchmarks and another 5 states had plans to do so. Another element of the program covers requiring all students to complete specific courses for graduation. The ADP minimum levels for course requirements include 4 years of mathematics (including 1 year of algebra II) and 4 years of college-preparatory or equivalent English courses. On this measure, 13 states had adopted such requirements by 2006 and another 16 states had plans to do so within a few years (Achieve, Inc. 2007).\nCourse Completions by High School Students\nIndicators of advanced coursetaking are based on data from the NAEP High School Transcript Study for the graduating class of 2005 and for earlier cohorts when examining trends. The transcript studies gather coursetaking data for a subset of the overall NAEP sample of 12th graders. (See sidebar \"Advanced Mathematics and Science Courses\" for an explanation of which courses are included as advanced.)\nTrends in Course Completions On average, high school students have completed more\nmathematics and science courses since 1990 (appendix tables 1-9 and 1-10), including more advanced courses in these subjects. In mathematics in particular, class of 2005 graduates completed courses at higher rates than their 1990 counterparts in all advanced mathematics categories except trigonometry/algebra III11 (figure 1-5). For example, the proportion of students completing courses in statistics/probability increased eightfold (to about 8%), and for precalculus/analysis, any calculus, and AP/IB calculus, it doubled over the 15-year period. (These jumps were from small initial bases in 1990.) Such increases likely result from a combination of higher state requirements, students' rising postsecondary aspirations, and growing demand for mathematics and logic skills in the workplace. Nevertheless, relatively small proportions of 2005 graduates had studied most of these subjects; at 29%, precalculus/analysis had the highest completion rate of mathematics courses shown.\nStudents also have registered higher course completion rates since 1990 in advanced biology, chemistry, and physics, although rates leveled off between 2000 and 2005 for these subjects (figure 1-6; appendix table 1-10). Except for environmental science, the rates of increase were not as sharp as for most mathematics categories. Whereas 4%\n\n\f1-20 \n\nChapter 1. Elementary and Secondary Education\n\nThe State of State Assessments\n\nState-administered tests seek to demonstrate whether students are achieving at the level required by state standards; they are also used to track progress in meeting federal requirements for student proficiency. In the 2006 academic year, 47 states and the District of Columbia administered mathematics assessments aligned with state standards at the elementary, middle, and high school levels (Editorial Projects in Education 2007). The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act requires assessments in mathematics by academic year 2005 in each grade 3\u00ad8 and one in grades 10\u00ad12; and in science by 2007 in at least one grade in elementary, middle, and high school. State-approved science assessments were thus commonly given but somewhat less widespread in 2006; for example, 20 states lacked them at the high school level. In addition, to graduate from high school in many states, students must surpass a cutoff score on upper grades tests that include mathematics.\nHow closely tests are aligned with course standards and curriculums remains a contested issue (Barton 2006). The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) recently reviewed state assessments and concluded that in some states, some tests are not sufficiently aligned with the standards (AFT 2006). Students in these states may therefore be tested on some skills and material that their teachers either did not address or covered inadequately, and their test results would not accurately reflect learning differences among groups or gains over time. Even tests with closely aligned content may have other drawbacks,\n\nparticularly in science. Although written tests can determine whether students understand elements like scientific concepts, methods of inquiry, and terminology, they cannot test hands-on laboratory skills.\nExperts have also questioned the quality of state achievement tests, pointing to both the validity of test items and the scores set for reaching certain achievement levels. For example, critics charge that some states may set the minimum score for proficient too low (Petrilli and Finn 2006; Ravitch 2005). The percentage of students reaching proficient on many state tests is close to the percentage reaching the basic level on NAEP, whereas in other states, percentages for the two tests are similar (Center for Public Education 2006; NCES 2007c). (See chapter 8 for recent NAEP scores by state.) Moreover, in an effort to increase the percentage of students considered proficient (a measure specified in NCLB), and facing pressure to make continuing progress toward the goal of universal proficiency by 2014, some state agencies have lowered the proficient cutoff scores on their tests over time (Petrilli and Finn 2006), thus undermining progress toward higher student achievement.\nDiscrepancies existed between state and NAEP test results even before NCLB took effect (Fuller et al. 2006). Although setting and reviewing standards and developing aligned tests are widely viewed as effective mechanisms for increasing learning, the details of implementation may still need to be evaluated and improved over time.\n\nFigure 1-5 High school graduates completing advanced mathematics courses, by subject: Selected years, 1990\u00ad2005\n\nPercent\n\n60\n\n1990\n\n1994\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0 Trigonometry or algebra III\n\nPrecalculus or analysis\n\nStatistics or probability\n\nAny calculus\n\nAP/IB calculus\n\nAP = Advanced Placement; IB = International Baccalaureate.

See appendix table 1-9.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 1-21\n\nAdvanced Mathematics and Science Courses\nAdvanced courses referenced in this section are defined as courses that not all students complete and that are not, as a rule, required for graduation. However, whether all courses in certain categories should be categorized as advanced is debatable. For example, any chemistry course, even a standard college preparatory course, is included in the category \"any chemistry.\" This point also applies to the categories any physics, any calculus, and any environmental science.\nThe \"any advanced biology\" category is slightly different from the other categories labeled \"any\" in that it includes second- and third-year biology courses and those designated honors, accelerated, or Advanced Placement/International Baccalaureate (AP/IB), plus a range of specialized courses like anatomy, physiology, and physical science of biotechnology, most of which are college-level courses. Advanced biology therefore does not include the standard first-year biology courses required of nearly all students. Similarly, earth science courses are not counted here because they are often (1) required and (2) not advanced, taking the form of basic survey courses that most students take in 9th or 10th grade. On the other hand, certain courses that are clearly advanced are not measured here because they are so rarely studied in high school (for example, space science/astronomy).\nAP/IB courses are all advanced; they aim to teach college-level material and develop skills needed for college study. A school's AP/IB courses are included in the broader category for the relevant subject as well as in the separate AP/IB category, which isolates the subset of courses that meet either of these programs' guidelines.\n\nof 1990 graduates studied environmental science, this rate grew to 10% for 2005.\nStudy of engineering was rare in all years examined, reaching 1.4% in 2005, but it did exhibit a strong growth trend between 1990 and 2005 (appendix table 1-10). The proportion of students taking courses in engineering/science technologies more than quadrupled over this time period, reaching nearly 7% in 2005.\nAmong the AP/IB courses, coursetaking rates doubled (or more) for calculus and environmental science (since 2000 for the latter) and increased slightly for biology.12 Overall, just less than 10% of graduates completed an AP/ IB calculus course and smaller proportions completed other AP/IB courses.\nThat course completions were rising while high school student test performance showed a mostly flat trend may appear puzzling. However, the increases in coursetaking may not yet be sufficient, particularly in science, to significantly raise average performance or the overall percentage of students reaching proficiency. (The increases in coursetaking have been less pronounced for science than for mathematics.) Also, the 2005 NAEP mathematics scores cannot fairly be compared with earlier scores because of the new test framework for 2005. Therefore, it is unclear whether mathematics achievement has recently gone up.\nAny number of other factors may also contribute to this apparent discrepancy, including changes in student characteristics, teacher skills, course content, and how closely the tests align with curriculum taught. For example, some students who in the past would have been unlikely to take these more advanced courses may have lower cognitive ability, less motivation, weaker study skills, and, for recent immigrants, lesser English skills than the more traditional advanced course takers. All of these factors could impede test performance. In addition, teachers of newly added courses may lack sufficient training to teach those courses effectively or may reduce coverage of material or complexity of\n\nFigure 1-6 High school graduates completing advanced S&E courses, by subject: Selected years, 1990\u00ad2005\n\nPercent\n80 1990\n\n1994\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0 Advanced biology\n\nChemistry\n\nPhysics\n\nEnvironmental science\n\nEngineering\n\nEngineering or science technologies\n\nSOURCES: National Center for Education Statistics, National Assessment of Educational Progress, 1990, 1994, 2000, and 2005 High School Transcript Studies; and National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, special tabulations.

Students in such classes may have a reduced opportunity to learn some of the relevant material and skills.\nCourse Completions by Class of 2005 Course completion rates differed in the graduating class\nof 2005 by several demographic and school characteristics. Female graduates had a slight edge over males in completing courses in precalculus/analysis, and historical differences favoring boys for the other advanced mathematics topics disappeared by 2005 (figure 1-7; appendix table 1-9). Thirtyseven percent of males studied physics compared with 33% of females; males were also more likely to complete an AP/ IB physics course but these differences were not great. Females studied advanced biology, AP/IB biology, and any chemistry at higher rates (figure 1-8; appendix table 1-10). For example, about 45% of young women studied advanced biology, compared with 33% of young men.\n\nAmong 2005 graduates, coursetaking rates also differed by racial/ethnic group for most course categories. In general, Asian/Pacific Islanders were the most likely to complete advanced mathematics and science courses (figures 1-7 and 1-8).13 For example, 25% of Asian/Pacific Islander graduates studied AP/IB calculus, compared with 11% of whites and less than 10% of other groups. Asian/Pacific Islander students were the most likely of all groups to earn credits in precalculus/ analysis, statistics/probability, calculus, chemistry, physics, and AP/IB classes in calculus, biology, chemistry, and physics. Black and Hispanic graduates were consistently less likely than Asian/Pacific Islander and white graduates to complete most of these advanced courses in mathematics and science; some exceptions to this pattern occurred with trigonometry/ algebra III, chemistry, environmental science, engineering, and engineering/science technologies. Black graduates were the most likely to study environmental science, at 14%,\n\nFigure 1-7 High school graduates completing advanced mathematics courses, by sex and race/ethnicity: 2005\n\nPercent\n\n80\n\nMale\n\nFemale\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0 Trigonometry or algebra III\n\nPrecalculus or analysis\n\nStatistics or probability Sex\n\n80\n\nWhite, non-Hispanic\n\nBlack, non-Hispanic\n\nHispanic\n\nAsian/Pacific Islander\n\nAny calculus\n\n60\n\nAP/IB calculus\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0 Trigonometry or algebra III\n\nPrecalculus or analysis\n\nStatistics or probability Race/ethnicity\n\nAny calculus\n\nAP/IB calculus\n\nAP = Advanced Placement; IB = International Baccalaureate.

The introduction of engineering-related courses in secondary schools is fairly recent and they remain uncommon; one national organization that promotes and supports such courses, Project Lead The Way, includes in its goals achieving proportionate racial/ethnic and sex composition of program participants (see sidebar \"Project Lead The Way\").\nIn addition to graduates' own demographic characteristics, certain characteristics of their high schools were linked to the chances that they studied advanced mathematics and science topics. Graduates of private schools were more likely than those of public schools to study each of the advanced mathematics subjects except statistics/probability, and each of the science subjects except advanced and AP/IB biology,\n\nenvironmental science (regular and AP/IB), and engineeringrelated courses (appendix tables 1-9 and 1-10), where apparent differences were not significant. As the school's poverty rate diminished, graduates were more likely to complete many of the advanced mathematics, science, and engineering courses (figure 1-9). For some subjects, a significant difference existed only between schools with very low poverty rates and all other schools.\nSummary\nIn 2006, nearly all states required at least 2 years of both mathematics and science for a high school diploma; 3 years was the most common requirement for both subjects. Standards governing coursework have expanded in some states to require specific courses and to raise course difficulty levels to prepare students for college and employment.\n\n\f1-24 \n\nChapter 1. Elementary and Secondary Education\n\nProject Lead The Way\n\nSome prominent STEM professionals have expressed concern that, as members of the current engineering and science workforce retire, they will not be replaced in adequate numbers (Business Roundtable 2005; Committee on Prospering in the Global Economy of the 21st Century 2006). In the former report, 15 leading business organizations called for the nation to double the number of STEM graduates by 2015.* These organizations argue that not only has the total number of engineering degrees awarded in the United States decreased in recent years (NSB 2006), but the proportion of doctoral degrees in engineering earned by U.S. citizens or permanent residents has also been dropping.\nProject Lead The Way (PLTW) is a pre-engineering program that aims to attract more students to engineering and train them for college study. It requires students to tackle challenging academic content in middle and high school to prepare for postsecondary study in engineering and related technologies. The program, started in 1997\u00ad 98 in a few schools, has expanded to more than 1,300 schools in 45 states plus the District of Columbia.\nPLTW seeks participation by students of both sexes and all racial/ethnic groups roughly in proportion to their share of the population. Evaluation data show that in 2004\u00ad05, Asian/Pacific Islander and white students were overrepresented, and black and Hispanic students underrepresented, when compared with their proportions in the sampled schools. However, compared with the distribution of students completing postsecondary degrees in engineering, each group (particularly Hispanics) had closer to proportional representation in PLTW. Females are seriously underrepresented among PLTW completers, constituting about 15% of the total. Program planners expect that female participation will increase as they introduce\n\nfour new biomedical science courses in 2008\u00ad09. The biomedical courses will address topics in microbiology, physiology, public health, and legal issues.\nThe curriculums reinforce high-level mathematics and science content aligned with national standards using engineering applications in electronics, robotics, and manufacturing processes. PTLW participants are required to study college-preparatory mathematics every year in grades 9\u00ad12. Students work, often in teams and using computers, on challenging problemsolving and analysis tasks. Students can qualify for college credit through performance on course exams, final grades, and project portfolios. The project provides curriculums for five 9-week units for grades 6\u00ad8 and eight high school courses. Middlegrade units address topics such as modeling, electrons, automation, robotics, the science of technology, and flight. High school courses offered currently include foundation courses such as Principles of Engineering, Engineering Design, and Digital Electronics; and specialization courses including Civil Engineering and Architecture, Computer Integrated Manufacturing, Aerospace Engineering, and Biotechnical Engineering. A capstone course requires advanced students to develop a solution to a complex engineering problem with guidance from a mentor and to defend their project to external reviewers.\n* Organizations contributing to the report (Tapping America's Potential) include the Business Roundtable, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the Council on Competitiveness.\n Although the report presents a dire picture of sharp declines in STEM degrees earned (particularly in engineering), in reality STEM degrees as a percentage of all degrees has fluctuated in a fairly narrow range from 1994 to 2004 at the bachelor's, master's, and doctoral levels, and near the top of the four-decade range for all but master's degrees (NSB 2006). Indeed, doctorates in engineering were 13.7% of all doctorates awarded in 2004, near the high end of their range since 1966.\n\nTrends from 1990 to 2005 show increasing proportions of students studying most advanced mathematics and science courses, with growth especially rapid in mathematics. Students also increased course completions since 1990 in advanced biology, chemistry, and physics. Despite growth in AP/IB course completions, fewer than 10% of graduates completed any AP/IB course.\nAsian/Pacific Islander students were the most likely of all racial/ethnic groups to earn credits in many mathematics and science subjects, especially in several AP/IB classes. Graduates of private schools and schools with lower poverty rates were more likely than others to study most of these advanced subjects.\n\nMathematics and Science Teacher Quality\nOf the many factors affecting student learning, teacher quality is believed to be one of the most important. Research shows that students learn more from teachers who are skilled, experienced, and know what and how to teach (Darling-Hammond 2000; Darling-Hammond and Youngs 2002; Goldhaber 2002; Hanushek et al. 2005; Rice 2003; Wayne and Youngs 2003). The recent federal NCLB Act has focused a great deal of attention on improving teacher quality in the nation's public schools. It legislates the goal of having a highly qualified teacher in every classroom, and provides a definition of a \"highly qualified teacher\" (No Child Left Behind Act of 2001).15\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 1-25\n\nFigure 1-9 High school graduates completing advanced mathematics and other S&E courses, by school poverty level: 2005\n\nPercent\n\n80\n\nVery low\n\nLow\n\nMedium\n\nHigh\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0 Trigonometry or algebra III\n\nPrecalculus or analysis\n\nStatistics or probability\n\nAny calculus\n\nAP/IB calculus\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0 Advanced biology\n\nAny chemistry\n\nAny physics\n\nEnvironmental science\n\nEngineering\n\nEngineering or science technologies\n\nAP = Advanced Placement; IB = International Baccalaureate\nNOTE: School poverty level defined as percentage of students eligible for national free/reduced-priced lunch program: very low = 5%, low = 6%\u00ad25%, medium = 26%\u00ad50%, and high = 51%\u00ad100%.\nSOURCES: National Center for Education Statistics, National Assessment of Educational Progress, 2005 High School Transcript Study; and National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, special tabulations. See appendix tables 1-9 and 1-10.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nThis section uses data from SASS to examine indicators of teacher quality, focusing on preservice preparation, degree of congruity between teachers' field of preparation and teaching assignment, and years of teaching experience.16 The main focus is on mathematics and science teachers in public middle and high schools17 (see sidebar \"Demographic Characteristics of Mathematics and Science Teachers in U.S. Public Schools\"). Although this section draws heavily on data from the 2003\u00ad04 SASS, comparable data from the 1999\u00ad2000 SASS are also used to examine changes occurring over time. When possible, measures are analyzed separately for schools with differing concentrations of minority and low-income students.\n\nPreparation for Teaching\nFormal preparation for teaching is typically indicated by highest degree and types of certification. Although having a college degree and certification do not guarantee that a teacher has the deep grasp of subject matter and the repertoire of instructional skills necessary for effective teaching (Public Agenda 2006), they represent two indicators of teacher qualification and are the two basic elements in the NCLB definition of highly qualified teachers. Experts recommend that teachers not only study varied aspects of the profession during preservice education, but also engage in extensive practical training through practice teaching, which is often a requirement for completing an educational degree or state certification, or both (NCTAF 1996; Rice 2003). The following section examines these aspects of preparation that teachers engaged in before starting work in the profession.\n\n\f1-26 \n\nChapter 1.

However, mathematics and science teachers holding graduate degrees were not equally distributed across schools. In 2003, for example, mathematics and science teachers in low-poverty schools were more likely than their colleagues in high-poverty schools to have a master's degree or higher (appendix table 1-11).18 Science teachers with a master's degree or higher were also more prevalent in lowminority schools than in high-minority schools.\n\nCertification Status In addition to teachers' formal education, certification is\nan important component of their qualifications. Certification is generally awarded by state education agencies to teachers who have completed specific requirements. These requirements vary across states but typically include completing a bachelor's degree, completing a period of practice teaching, and passing some type of formal test(s) (Kaye 2002). Most teachers complete regular certification programs before beginning to teach. In 2003, 88% of all public school teachers and 84% of mathematics and science teachers held regular or advanced certification (hereinafter called full certification) issued by their state (table 1-9). However, fully certified\n\nDemographic Characteristics of Mathematics and Science Teachers in U.S. Public Schools\n\nIn 2003, about 3.2 million teachers were employed in U.S. public elementary and secondary schools (table 1-7). About 231,000 were mathematics teachers and 208,000 were science teachers, based on main assignment field (the subject in which they taught the most classes).\nThe U.S. public school teaching force increased by 7% from 1999 to 2003; the numbers of mathematics and science teachers increased even more, by 11% and 14%, respectively. Most of these increases have occurred in middle schools or in schools with the highest concentrations of minority and poor students. In contrast, and to place these increased staffing levels in perspective, public school enrollment rose by 3%, from 46.9 million in 1999 to 48.5 million in 2003 (NCES 2006c).\nIn both 1999 and 2003, three of every four public school teachers were female (table 1-8). However, the predominance of female teachers was less pronounced at the high school level. In 2003, for example, 56% of public high school teachers were women. The sex dis-\n\ntribution among public school mathematics and science teachers reflects the overall pattern.\nPublic school teachers were also predominantly white. In both 1999 and 2003, black and Hispanic teachers accounted for 8% and 6%, respectively, and other racial/ ethnic groups accounted for less than 3%. The racial and ethnic distributions among middle and high school mathematics and science teachers resemble the overall pattern. Although the share of black and Hispanic teachers among middle and high school mathematics and science teachers appeared to increase between 1999 and 2003, these changes were not statistically significant.\nThe average age of the teacher workforce increased slightly over this period. In 1999, 29% of public school teachers were at least 50 years old; that percentage rose to 33% in 2003. Similar trends were also observed among middle and high school mathematics and science teachers. These trends suggest that more teachers are approaching retirement age and that recruitment needs may exceed recent levels.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 1-27\n\nTable 1-7 Public school teachers, by minority enrollment and school poverty level: Academic years 1999\u00ad2000 and 2003\u00ad04\n\nAll teachers\n\nMathematics teachers\n\nScience teachers\n\nSchool characteristic\n\nChange\n\nChange\n\nChange\n\n1999\u00ad2000 2003\u00ad04 (%) 1999\u00ad2000 2003\u00ad04 (%) 1999\u00ad2000 2003\u00ad04 (%)\n\nAll public schools .................. 2,986,000 3,220,000 7.3 206,000 231,000 10.8 180,000 208,000 13.5\n\nMiddle schools...................

Elementary and Secondary Education\n\nteachers were more common in schools with lower proportions of minority and poor students (appendix table 1-12).\nIn response to a growing demand for teachers because of increased enrollment and reduced class size, many states have also developed various alternative certification programs allowing individuals to become teachers without first completing a regular certification program (Shen 1997). Depending on the particular requirements completed, these individuals are typically awarded probationary, provisional/ temporary, or emergency licenses.19 In 2003, 11% of all public school teachers and 15% of mathematics and science teachers held one of these kinds of certification (table 1-9).\nSome states still allow public schools to hire teacher candidates who do not have a license. However, this practice has significantly decreased during recent years; between 1999 and 2003, the percentage of public school mathematics and science teachers who did not have a teaching certificate declined from 10% to 1%.\nPractice Teaching The majority of public middle and high school mathemat-\nics and science teachers with less than 5 years of teaching experience (hereinafter called beginning teachers) had participated in practice teaching before starting the job; many had practiced for at least 5 weeks (figure 1-10).20 However, participation in practice teaching has declined in recent years. In 1999, 83%\u00ad89% of beginning mathematics and science teachers reported participation in practice teaching for some period of time. These percentages dropped to 75%\u00ad79% in 2003. In addition, teachers with practice teaching were not evenly distributed across schools: the percentage of beginning mathematics and science teachers who had any practice teaching was inversely related to school concentrations of minority and poor students (appendix table 1-13).\n\nFigure 1-10 Practice teaching of public middle and high school teachers with less than 5 years of teaching experience: Academic years 1999\u00ad2000 and 2003\u00ad04\nPercent\n\n100\n89 88 83\n80\n\nMathematics\n\nScience\n\nOther\n\n86 85 80\n\n79\n\n81\n\n75\n\n75\n\n78\n\n73\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0 Participated in practice teaching\n\nParticipated for 5 weeks\n\nAcademic year 1999\u00ad2000\n\nParticipated in practice teaching\n\nParticipated for 5 weeks\n\nAcademic year 2003\u00ad04\n\nSOURCES: National Center for Education Statistics, Schools and Staffing Survey, 1999\u00ad2000 and 2003\u00ad04; and National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, special tabulations.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nSelf-Assessment of Preparedness Public middle and high school teachers generally felt\nwell prepared to perform various tasks during their first year of teaching (figure 1-11), particularly teaching the subject\n\nTable 1-9 Type of certification of public school teachers: Academic years 1999\u00ad2000 and 2003\u00ad04 (Percent distribution)\n\nAcademic year 1999\u00ad2000\n\nAcademic year 2003\u00ad04\n\nType of certification\n\nAll teachers\n\nMathematics and science\n\nAll teachers\n\nMathematics and science\n\nAll teachers..............................................

Mathematics teachers were more likely than science teachers to report feeling that they had strong preparation for various tasks except for using computers to teach. In general, beginning teachers who taught in schools with lower minority enrollment and poverty rates expressed more confidence about handling their first teaching assignment (appendix table 1-14).\n\nTeacher confidence about preparation for their first teaching job was related to practice teaching. Beginning mathematics and science teachers who participated in practice teaching were more likely than their counterparts without any practice teaching to report feeling well prepared to perform various teaching tasks (figure 1-11).\n\n\f1-30 \n\nChapter 1. Elementary and Secondary Education\n\nMatch Between Teacher Preparation and Assignment\nOver the past decade, no issue related to teacher quality has received more attention than out-of-field teaching in the nation's middle and high schools (Ingersoll 2003; Jerald 2002; Peske and Haycock 2006). This issue is crucial because even well-educated and fully certified teachers may be unqualified, in practical terms, if they are assigned to teach subjects for which they have little formal preparation. To determine how many teachers are teaching their subjects without specific kinds of formal training in those subjects, efforts have focused on the nature of teacher qualifications (postsecondary coursework or state certification in their teaching assignment field) (Ingersoll 1999, 2003; NCTAF 1996). Teachers without qualifications in their teaching assignment fields are described as teaching out of field.\nThe following indicators use SASS data to examine the scope of out-of-field teaching among public middle and high school mathematics and science teachers in academic year\n\n2003. The sidebar \"In-Field and Out-of-Field Teaching\" provides the detailed definitions used in this section.\nMathematics In 2003, over half (54%) of mathematics teachers in pub-\nlic middle schools were teaching in field (table 1-10). Five percent were teaching out of field; that is, they taught mathematics with neither a major nor certification in mathematics, related fields, or general education. At the high school level, a substantial majority of mathematics teachers were in field (87%), and about 8% were teaching out of field.\nBiological/Life Sciences More than half (55%) of biology/life science teachers\n(hereinafter called biology teachers) at the middle school level were teaching in field. About 10% of middle school biology teachers were teaching out of field, about twice the proportion of middle school mathematics teachers. The vast majority of high school biology teachers (92%) were teaching in field, and 3% were teaching out of field.\n\nIn-Field and Out-of-Field Teaching\n\nDifferent researchers (and previous editions of Indicators) have defined out-of-field teaching in different ways (Ingersoll 1999, 2003; McGrath, Holt, and Seastrom 2005; Seastrom et al. 2002). Estimates of how widespread out-of-field teaching is depend on how strictly the concept is defined. This section uses a four-level indicator of the linkage between preparation for teaching science and mathematics courses and the main teaching assignment reported by teachers in SASS.\nIn the following definitions full certification includes regular, advanced, or probationary certification status. Major refers to the field of study for an undergraduate or graduate degree. Unlike related concepts used in the research literature, this definition recognizes general preparation. State certification regulations vary about whether they treat middle-grade teachers more like elementary teachers (thus requiring a general education credential that covers some preparation in core academic subjects) or more like secondary teachers (requiring single-subject credentials). In some states, the most common type of certification for middle-grade teachers is a general elementary certificate.\nThe four levels of the indicator are as follows (in decreasing strength of linkage between teacher preparation and the teacher's main assignment field).\nIn-field. In-field teachers have either a major or full certification in their main teaching field, or both. For example, a mathematics teacher is in field if he or she majored in mathematics or is fully certified in mathematics.\nRelated-field. Related-field teachers have either a major or full certification in a field related to their main teaching field, or both. For example, a related-field math-\n\nematics teacher has a major or full certification in computer science, engineering, or physics.\nGeneral preparation. General preparation teachers have either a major or full certification in general elementary, middle, or secondary education. For example, a physics teacher has general preparation if he or she has a major or full certification in general elementary, middle, or secondary education.\nOut-of-field. Out-of-field teachers have neither a major nor full certification in their main teaching field, a related field, or general elementary, middle, or secondary education. For example, a biology/life science teacher is teaching out-of-field if he or she has neither a major nor certification in biology, a related field (e.g., physics, chemistry, earth science), or general elementary, middle, or secondary education.\nThis indicator cannot be used as a gauge of teacher competence because indicators of quality teaching include many other characteristics that are difficult and costly to measure, such as commitment to the profession, sense of responsibility for student learning, and ability to motivate students and diagnose and remedy their learning difficulties. Nevertheless, research, policy, and legislation (e.g., NCLB) point to in-field teaching as a desirable national goal, and states, schools, and school systems administrators can look to this indicator as they engage in efforts to improve teaching.\nThe discussion in this section focuses on the polar categories of in-field and out-of-field teaching. Appendix table 1-15 also provides data on the nation's teachers of mathematics, biology/life science, and physical sciences who fall between these two extremes.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 1-31\n\nTable 1-10 In-field and out-of-field teaching of public middle and high school mathematics, biology/ life science, and physical science teachers: Academic year 2003\u00ad04\n(Percent)\n\nLevel/field\n\nIn-field teaching\n\nOut-of-field teaching\n\nMiddle school\n\nMathematics ........................\n\n53.5\n\n5.1\n\nBiology/life sciences ............\n\n54.8\n\n9.5\n\nPhysical sciences ................\n\n32.7\n\n3.1\n\nHigh school\n\nMathematics ........................\n\n87.4\n\n7.5\n\nBiology/life sciences ............\n\n91.9\n\n3.2\n\nPhysical sciences ................\n\n78.1\n\n1.5\n\nSOURCES: National Center for Education Statistics, Schools and Staffing Survey, 2003\u00ad04; and National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, special tabulations. See appendix table 1-15.\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nPhysical Sciences Overall, physical science teachers were less qualified on\nthis indicator than mathematics and biology teachers. At the middle school level, 33% of physical science teachers were teaching in field and 3% were teaching out of field. At the high school level, 78% of physical science teachers were teaching in field and 2%, out of field.\nVariation Across Schools In-field and out-of-field teachers were not distributed even-\nly across schools (appendix table 1-15). In general, mathematics and science teachers in schools with lower concentrations of minority and poor students were more likely to be teaching in field, and those in schools with higher concentrations of minority and poor students were more likely to be teaching out of field. Among high school mathematics teachers, for example, 10% of those in high-minority schools taught mathematics out of field compared with 3% of their counterparts in low-minority schools. Among high school physical science teachers, 86% in low-poverty schools were teaching in field, compared with 77% in high-poverty schools.\nTeaching Experience\nAlthough experience does not guarantee quality teaching, empirical evidence indicates that teachers who have at least several years of teaching experience are generally more effective than new teachers in helping students learn (Fetler 1999; Hanushek et al. 2005; Murnane and Phillips 1981; Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain 2000; Rowan, Correnti, and Miller 2002). The following discussion focuses on new mathematics and science teachers (those with 3 or fewer years of teaching experience) and how they are distributed across schools.\n\nIn 2003, new teachers made up 17%\u00ad22% of mathematics teachers and 15%\u00ad19% of science teachers in public middle and high schools (appendix table 1-16). At the middle school level, the proportion of new teachers was greater among mathematics teachers (22%) than among science teachers or teachers in other fields (15% for both). The difference was not observed at the high school level, however. In general, high-minority and high-poverty schools were more likely than low-minority and low-poverty schools to have new mathematics and science teachers. This was particularly true for mathematics teachers in middle schools: in high-minority and high-poverty middle schools, 28%\u00ad33% of mathematics teachers were new teachers, but in low-minority and lowpoverty schools, the percentages were 15%\u00ad18%.\nSummary\nVirtually all public school mathematics and science teachers had a bachelor's degree and nearly 9 in 10 held full state certification. The majority of beginning mathematics and science teachers in public middle and high schools had also participated in practice teaching before starting their first teaching job, although the percentage of teachers with practice teaching experience declined from 1999 to 2003. Teachers with preservice practice teaching had greater confidence about their ability to handle their first teaching assignment.\nMore than three-fourths of mathematics and science teachers in public high schools were teaching in field. However, in-field teaching was less common at the middle school level. Overall, out-of-field teaching ranged from 3% of physical science teachers to 10% of biology teachers in middle schools and from 2% of physical science teachers to 8% of mathematics teachers in high schools. All indicators examined in this section showed a general pattern of unequal access to the most qualified teachers: low-minority and low-poverty schools were more likely than high-minority and high-poverty schools to have teachers with more education, better preparation and qualifications in their field, and more experience.\nProfessional Development of Mathematics and Science Teachers\nTeacher professional development is a major component of current reform policies (Cohen and Hill 2001; DarlingHammond 2005; Hirsch, Koppich, and Knapp 2001; Little 1993) (see sidebar \"State Professional Development Policies for Teachers\"). To help all students meet the high educational standards necessary to participate in the global workforce, today's teachers are being called on to provide their students with a high-quality education and to teach in ways they have never taught before. The nature and magnitude of changes demanded by these reform policies require a great deal of learning on the part of teachers. Ongoing professional development provides a vehicle for teachers to gain such learning (NCTAF 1997; NRC 2007). Research has demonstrated that sustained and intensive participation in\n\n\f1-32 \n\nChapter 1. Elementary and Secondary Education\n\nState Professional Development Policies for Teachers\nFor two decades, the U.S. government has made teacher professional development a component of its reform efforts (Little 1993; Porter et al. 2000), and many states have developed and implemented policies designed to promote participation in professional development (CCSSO 2005, 2007; Editorial Projects in Education 2006). A total of 48 states required professional development for teacher license renewal in both 2002 and 2006 (table 1-11). Between 2004 and 2006, the number of states that had standards in place for professional development increased from 35 to 40, as did those that financed professional development programs (37 to 39), provided professional development funds for all districts in the state (27 to 31), and required districts or schools to set aside teacher time for professional development (13 to 15). In 2006, 15 states also required and financed mentoring programs for all novice teachers.\n\nTable 1-11 States with various professional development policies for teachers: 2004 and 2006\n\nStatewide policy\n\n2004 2006\n\nRequired professional development for teacher license renewal ...........................\nWrote professional development standards .................................................\nFinanced professional development .........\nFinanced professional development for all districts in state...................................\nRequired and financed mentoring for all novice teachers ......................................\n\n48a 48 35 40 37 39 27 31 16 15\n\nRequired districts/schools to set aside time for professional development .........\n\n13 15\n\na2002 count.\n\nSOURCES: Council of Chief State School Officers, Key State Education Policies on PK-12 Education: 2002 (2002); Key State Education Policies on PK-12 Education: 2006 (2007); Editorial Projects in Education 2005, State of the states, Education Week: Quality Counts 24(17); and Quality counts at 10: A decade of standards-based education, Education Week: Quality Counts 2006 25(17).\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nhigh-quality professional development can change teacher attitudes, behaviors, and the instructional practices they use in the classroom (Banilower et al. 2005; Garet et al. 2001; Guskey 2003; Hawley and Valli 2001; Porter et al. 2000). Furthermore, student learning increased when their teachers changed in these ways (Cohen and Hill 2000; Desimone et al. 2002; Holland 2005; Wenglinsky 2002).\n\nThis section examines several indicators of teacher professional development, including new teacher induction; features of teacher participation in professional development (i.e., content, duration, format, and extent of collaboration); teacher assessments of the usefulness of professional development activities; and their priorities for future activities. These indicators help determine the extent to which effective features of professional development exist at the national level.\nNew Teacher Induction\nResearch suggests that teachers with less experience, particularly those in their first year of teaching, are less effective in the classroom (Murnane and Phillips 1981). Without sufficient support and guidance, novice teachers may reduce their commitment to teaching and may leave the profession altogether (Smith and Ingersoll 2004; Smith and Rowley 2005). Teacher induction programs are designed at the school, local, or state level to assist and support beginning teachers in their first few years of teaching (Fulton, Yoon, and Lee 2005).21 The purpose is to help new teachers improve professional practice, deepen their understanding of teaching, and prevent early attrition (Britton et al. 2003; Smith and Ingersoll 2004). One key component of such programs is that new teachers are paired with mentors or other experienced teachers to receive advice, instruction, and support.\nParticipation in induction and mentoring programs has been fairly common and has become more so in recent years. In 2003, 68%\u00ad72% of beginning mathematics and science teachers in public middle and high schools reported that they had participated in a formal teacher induction program or had worked closely with a mentor teacher during their first year of teaching (appendix table 1-17). However, smaller proportions of these teachers had worked closely with a mentor in the same subject field (50%\u00ad52%). Teacher participation in induction and mentoring programs was lower in schools with high concentrations of minority and low-income students.\nOngoing Professional Development\nAlmost all teachers participate in some form of professional development activities every school year (Choy, Chen, and Bugarin 2006; Scotchmer, McGrath, and Coder 2005). It is important not only to make professional development accessible to teachers, but also to identify features that bring about positive changes in teaching practices and student learning and to build these features into the activities (Elmore 2002; Garet et al. 2001; Guskey 2003; Hawley and Valli 2001; Loucks-Horsley et al. 2003). Recognizing this new need, the education research community began to develop a knowledge base of what constitutes effective professional development programs. Several key features have been identified that are linked to positive change in teacher knowledge and instructional practices, including content focusing on teacher subjectmatter knowledge or how students learn the subject content; programs of long and sustained duration (recent research suggests at least 80 hours); program content integrated into teach-\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 1-33\n\ners' daily work, rather than removed from the context of direct teaching (as in traditional workshops); and emphasis on a team approach and collaboration among teachers (Banilower et al. 2005; Clewell et al. 2004; Cohen and Hill 2000; Desimone et al. 2002; Garet et al. 2001; Porter et al. 2000). The following indicators examine the extent to which public middle and high school mathematics and science teachers participated in professional development that had these characteristics.\nContent Professional development activities tend to focus on a few\ntopics and teaching skills, frequently on the teacher's main teaching subject. In 2003, more than 70% of mathematics, science, and other subject-area teachers in public middle and high schools reported participation in professional development that focused on the content of the subjects they taught (figure 1-12). Another frequent topic of professional development is using computers for instruction: 64%\u00ad67% of teachers reported receiving professional development on this topic. Relatively fewer teachers (38%\u00ad45%) participated in professional development related to student discipline and classroom management.\nParticipation rates varied across schools. Mathematics and science teachers who taught in high-minority and highpoverty schools were more likely than those in low-minority and low-poverty schools to report receiving professional development on subject matter and on student discipline and classroom management (appendix table 1-18).22\nDuration Recent research emphasizes intensive participation as a\ncritical feature of effective professional development. Teachers are likely to benefit more from professional development programs that are sustained over an extended period of time\n\nFigure 1-12 Professional development of public middle and high school teachers during past 12 months, by topic: Academic year 2003\u00ad04\n\nPercent\n\n100\n\nMathematics\n\nScience\n\nOther\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0 Content of\nsubject(s)\ntaught\n\nUse of computers for instruction\n\nStudent discipline and classroom management\n\nSOURCES: National Center for Education Statistics, Schools and Staffing Survey, 2003\u00ad04; and National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, special tabulations. See appendix table 1-18.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nand involve a significant number of hours. Some studies recommend at least 60\u00ad80 hours to bring about meaningful change in teaching practice (Banilower et al. 2005; Supovitz and Turner 2000; Weiss, Banilower, and Shimkus 2004). However, few teachers participated in professional development programs for this amount of time. In 2003, between 4% and 28% of mathematics and science teachers in public middle and high schools reported attending professional development on various topics for 33 or more hours over the course of a school year (figure 1-13). Most teachers received 9\u00ad32 hours of professional development on their subject matter or 8 or fewer hours of professional development on using computers for classroom instruction or on student discipline and classroom management.23 Thus, the amount of time teachers devoted to professional development may be less than research suggests may be optimal.\nFormats The format of professional development refers to the way\nin which a professional development activity is delivered. For many years, teacher professional development has been primarily through district- or school-sponsored workshops, conferences, and training sessions (Choy and Chen 1998; Choy, Chen, and Bugarin 2006; Parsad, Lewis, and Farris 2001). In 2003, more than 90% of public middle and high school mathematics, science, and other subject-area teachers participated in professional development through workshops, conferences, and training sessions (figure 1-14).

Participation in such activities as visiting other schools or conducting research on a topic of interest was also not common (14%\u00ad43%).24\nCollaborative Participation Collaborative participation, which involves professional\ndevelopment designed for groups of teachers from the same school, department, and grade level, fosters cooperation and interaction among teachers (Garet et al. 2001; Desimone et al. 2002). Two constructs were used here to measure this concept, regularly scheduled collaboration with other teachers on issues of instruction and participation in mentoring, peer observation, or coaching. Based on these measures, teacher collaboration was common. In 2003, about twothirds of public middle and high school mathematics, science, and other subject-area teachers reported that they had collaborated regularly with other teachers on matters of instruction (figure 1-15). More than 70% of these teachers reported that they had participated in peer observation, mentoring, or coaching activities.25\nTeacher Assessment of Professional Development\nWere professional development activities useful to teachers? Teachers' assessments of their professional development activities were generally positive. In 2003, 62%\u00ad69% of mathematics, science, and other subject-area teachers in public middle and high schools rated activities on subject content and use of computers for instruction as \"useful\" or\n\n\"very useful\" (appendix table 1-19). Between 53% and 59% of participants gave similar ratings to the topic of student discipline and classroom management.\nTeachers' assessments were strongly related to the amount of time they spent on these activities. For each topic, the more time teachers spent in professional development, the more likely they were to indicate that it was useful or very useful. This relationship held for mathematics, science, and other subject-area teachers.\n\nFigure 1-15 Collaborative professional development activities of public middle and high school teachers: Academic year 2003\u00ad04\n\nPercent 100\nMathematics\n\nScience\n\nOther\n\n80\n\n70 66 65\n\n60\n\n73 75 72\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0 Regularly scheduled\ncollaboration with other teachers on issues of instruction\n\nMentoring, peer observation, or coaching\n\nSOURCES: National Center for Education Statistics, Schools and Staffing Survey, 2003\u00ad04; and National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, special tabulations.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 1-35\n\nTeacher Priorities for Professional Development\nIn addition to assessing the usefulness of the programs they attended, teachers identified their priorities for future professional development. Public middle and high school mathematics and science teachers rated their main subject field and the use of technology for instruction as their top interest for future professional development (appendix table 1-20). Teachers in other subject areas had somewhat different priorities. Although the main subject field was also their top pick (24%), many also chose student discipline and classroom management (19%) and teaching students with special needs or limited English proficiency (18%).\nTeachers in different types of schools had different priorities. For example, mathematics and science teachers in high-minority and high-poverty schools were more likely to identify student discipline and classroom management as their top priority, whereas their colleagues in low-minority and low-poverty schools were more likely to pick the content of the main subject field.\nSummary\nInduction and mentoring programs are designed to help new teachers become more effective and stay in teaching. These programs are presently widely implemented in public schools. Teacher participation in professional development was also common. In 2003, for example, more than 70% of public middle and high school mathematics and science teachers reported participation in professional development that focused on the content of the subject matter they taught. However, although recent research has found that intensive participation lasting at least 60\u00ad80 hours might be necessary to bring about meaningful change in teaching practice, just 4%\u00ad28% of mathematics and science teachers in public middle and high schools attended a professional development program for 33 hours or more over a school year, suggesting that the current amount of time devoted to teacher professional development may not be enough.\nThe majority of teachers participated in professional development by attending workshops, conferences, and training sessions. Most teachers indicated that the professional development programs in which they participated were useful, especially those that emphasized the content of their subject matter and the use of computers for instruction. Teachers also rated more highly professional development programs that were of longer duration.\nTeacher Salaries, Working Conditions, and Job Satisfaction\nThe challenge of staffing the nation's schools with highly qualified teachers has turned policymaker and researcher attention to the issues of hiring and retention. Reports of difficulty in hiring teachers in elementary and secondary schools began to emerge in the early 1990s and have continued in\n\nrecent years (Arnold and Choy 1993; BHEF 2007; Broughman and Rollefson 2000; Carroll, Reichardt, and Guarino 2000; Guarino, Santibanez, and Daley 2006; Murphy, DeArmond, and Guin 2003; NCTAF 1996, 2003). Although there have been various explanations for this situation,26 current research suggests that in recent years hiring difficulty was primarily caused by large numbers of teachers leaving the profession before regular retirement age (Cochran-Smith 2004; Ingersoll 2001, 2004, 2006; Merrow 1999; Wayne 2000) (see sidebar \"Attrition From Teaching\"). Filling vacancies, seeking qualified candidates, and introducing and mentoring new teachers all involve financial costs (Brenner 2000). The consequences could be even worse if unqualified or partially qualified individuals have to be hired to replace those who leave (NCTAF 2003).\nWhy do teachers leave their jobs before retirement? What makes them want to stay in the profession? Researchers have addressed these important questions (Guarino, Santibanez, and Daley 2006). Although many factors can influence teachers' decisions about leaving or staying in their jobs, results from past research consistently indicate that teacher working conditions and salary levels are critical in such decisions (Boyd et al. 2005; Dolton and Wilbert 1999; Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin 2004; Ingersoll 2006; Loeb, Darling-Hammond, and Luczak 2005; Perie and Baker 1997). The research evidence suggests that adequate compensation and safe and supportive school environments serve to attract and retain teachers, whereas low pay and poor working conditions undermine teachers' long-term commitment to their jobs.\nThis section examines several indicators related to teacher working conditions, including their salaries, perceptions of their work environments, overall job satisfaction, and willingness to continue to teach. To provide a context for such a discussion, the section begins by examining whether there has been an insufficient number of teachers in mathematics and science in recent years. It concludes by looking at how various aspects of teacher work environments are linked to their longterm commitment to teaching as a career and profession.\nTeaching Vacancies in Mathematics and Science\nResearchers have used various methods to determine the extent of any possible teacher shortage,27 including counting the number of teachers holding alternative or emergency licenses; estimating the net effects of student enrollment, teacher retirement, and teacher attrition; and assessing teaching vacancy rates (Arnold and Choy 1993; Broughman and Rollefson 2000; Carroll, Reichardt, and Guarino 2000; Guarino, Santibanez, and Daley 2006; Henke et al. 1997; Murphy, DeArmond, and Guin 2003). Although none of these methods has proven perfect, researchers found some consistent patterns: teacher shortages existed in specific subject fields, in geographic locations, and in some individual schools. For example, teacher shortages occurred more frequently in certain states where the population grew fast because of immigration and high rates of childbirth (e.g.,\n\n\f1-36 \n\nChapter 1. Elementary and Secondary Education\n\nCalifornia, Texas, and Florida); in specific subjects such as mathematics, science, special education, and bilingual education; and in schools located in high-poverty areas (Boe et al. 1998; Howard 2003; Wayne 2000). The following analysis uses school reports of teaching vacancies to evaluate whether there were insufficient numbers of mathematics and science teachers in public secondary schools.\nAdministrators of schools that participated in SASS were asked whether, in the current school year, their schools had vacancies in various fields (i.e., teaching positions needing to be filled) and how difficult it was to fill these vacant positions. The majority of public secondary schools experienced teaching vacancies in one or more fields (figure 1-16). The vacancy rate decreased somewhat during recent years; still, 80% of public secondary schools reported teaching vacan-\n\ncies in 2003. In both 1999 and 2003, mathematics was one of the fields that had a relatively high vacancy rate. In 2003, for example, 74% of public secondary schools with any teaching vacancy reported at least one vacant position in mathematics. Vacancy rates for biology/life and physical sciences were also high, with 52%-56% reporting at least one vacant position in these fields.\nThe data in figure 1-16 further reveal that mathematics and physical sciences were among the most difficult fields in which to find teachers in both 1999 and 2003.28 Although this situation has improved during recent years, close to onethird of public secondary schools with teacher vacancies in mathematics and physical sciences in 2003 either found them very difficult to fill or were unable to do so. Although secondary schools had a high teacher vacancy rate in biology/\n\nFigure 1-16 Teaching vacancies at public secondary schools, by subject: Academic years 1999\u00ad2000 and 2003\u00ad04\n\nSchools with vacancies in various subjects\n\nSchools that found it very difficult to or could not fill vacancies in subject\n\nMathematics English/\nlanguage arts Special education\nSocial studies\nBiology/life sciences\nForeign languages Vocational/\ntechnical education Physical sciences\nMusic/art\nComputer science English as\nsecond language\n\n70 74\n71 73\n67 68\n66 65\n61 56\n54 56\n47 52\n51 52\n52 49\n40 33\n34 36\n\nMathematics\n\nEnglish/\n\n9\n\nlanguage arts\n\n8\n\nSpecial education\n\n5 Social studies\n3\n\nBiology/life sciences\n\nForeign languages\nVocational/ technical education\nPhysical sciences\n\nMusic/art\n\nComputer science\nEnglish as second language\n\n43 32\n\n40 3311\n\n29 22\n\nAcademic year 1999\u00ad2000 Academic year 2003\u00ad04\n\n45 32\n\n41 27\n\n40 31\n\n27 22\n\n35\n\n23 31\n\nAcademic year 1999\u00ad2000 A4c2ademic year 2003\u00ad04\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nPercent\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nPercent\n\nNOTES: Teaching vacancies are teaching positions needing to be filled in current school year.

Indeed, among professions requiring a minimum of a bachelor's degree, teaching is a relatively low-paying profession. In 2003, the annual median salaries for full-time high school mathematics and science teachers and all full-time elementary school teachers were $43,000 and $41,000, respectively, far below those of professions requiring comparable educational backgrounds (e.g., computer systems analysts, engineers, accountants or financial specialists, and protective service workers) (table 1-12). Moreover, the salary increases for teachers lagged behind those who worked in other professions. Between 1993 and 2003, full-time high school mathematics and science teachers had a real salary gain of 8%, compared with increases of 21%-29% for computer systems analysts, accountants or financial specialists, and engineers. Similar results have been reported elsewhere (AFT 2005; Allegretto, Corcoran, and Mishel 2004). Although the difference in the number of weeks worked between teachers and those in other professions may explain some of the salary gaps, it cannot explain why these gaps grew over the years. If teaching salaries are not competitive with those offered in other professions requiring comparable education and skills, it may be difficult to retain teachers (especially those in mathematics and science) who may find more lucrative opportunities elsewhere.\n\nWhen asked to rate their satisfaction with their salaries, more than one-half of public middle and high school mathematics and science teachers expressed dissatisfaction (figure 1-17). Those in high-poverty schools were more likely than their colleagues in low-poverty schools to be unhappy with their salaries.\n\nFigure 1-17 Public middle and high school mathematics and science teachers not satisfied with salary, by minority enrollment and school poverty level: Academic year 2003\u00ad04\nPercent\n100\n\n80 60 53 40\n\n58 48\n\n57 41\n\n20\n\n0 All teachers\n\n5% >45%\nMinority enrollment\n\n10% >50%\nSchool poverty level\n\nNOTE: School poverty level is percentage of students in school qualifying for free/reduced-price lunch.\nSOURCES: National Center for Education Statistics, Schools and Staffing Survey, 2003\u00ad04; and National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, special tabulations.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nTable 1-12 Median annual salaries of full-time school teachers and selected other professions: 1993 and 2003 (2003 constant dollars)\n\nFull-time professionals\n\n1993\n\n2003\n\nChange (%)\n\nTeachers High school mathematics and science...................................

Elementary and Secondary Education\n\nAttrition From Teaching\n\nConcerns about K\u00ad12 teacher shortages, teacher quality, and the cost of keeping high-quality instructors in the nation's schools have led policymakers to focus attention on teacher attrition and to identify it as one of the most serious problems occurring today in the teaching profession (NCTAF 2003). A recent national study revealed that 8% of all public K\u00ad12 school teachers in the 2003\u00ad 04 academic year had left the teaching profession by the following year (Marvel et al. 2007). For public school mathematics and science teachers, about 6%\u00ad7% had left. Although the attrition rates of all teachers have continued to increase over time, the attrition rates for mathematics and science teachers appeared to level off in recent years (figure 1-18).\nAnother study (Henke, Cataldi, and Nevill forthcoming) focused on the attrition of a segment of new teachers (recent college graduates who taught any of grades K\u00ad12 immediately following receipt of a bachelor's degree) and compared their occupational stability with individu-\n\nals in other occupations. The results of this study suggest that movement among different occupations is common and that teaching is actually one of the more stable occupations in terms of attrition. As shown in figure 1-19, among recent college graduates working in April 1994, 34% were working in the same occupational category in 2003, and 54% had made a change in occupation. In contrast, of those working as K\u00ad12 teachers in 1994, 61% were still doing so in 2003, and only 21% had left teaching for nonteaching jobs. Teachers were more likely to remain in the same occupation than most other professionals, including those with comparable education such as legal professionals and legal support personnel, engineers, scientists, laboratory and research assistants, and computer and technical workers. Although recent college graduates do not represent the teaching workforce as a whole, in this study they indicate the job stability of teachers relative to that of other professionals.\n\nFigure 1-18 One-year attrition rate of public school teachers: Selected academic years, 1988\u00ad89 to 2004\u00ad05\n\nPercent\n\n10\n\n1988\u00ad89 1991\u00ad92 1994\u00ad95 2000\u00ad01 2004\u00ad05\n\n9.0\n\n8.4\n\n8\n\n7.4\n\n6.6\n\n6.9\n\n6.8\n\n6\n\n5.6\n\n5.1\n\n4.9 5.2\n\n6.1 5.4\n\n7.3\n6.5 5.9\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0 All teachers\n\nMathematics teachers\n\nScience teachers\n\nSOURCES: Whitener SD, Gruber KJ, Lynch H, Tingos K, Perona M, Fondelier S, Characteristics of Stayers, Movers, and Leavers: Results From the Teacher Follow-up Survey: 1994\u00ad95, National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), NCES 97-450 (1997); Luekens MT, Lyter DM, Fox EE, Teacher Attrition and Mobility: Results from the Teacher Follow-up Survey, 2000\u00ad01, NCES 2004-301 (2004); and Marvel J, Lyter DM, Peltola P, Strizek GA, Morton BA, Teacher Attrition and Mobility: Results from the 2004\u00ad05 Teacher Follow-up Survey, NCES 2007-307 (2006).\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nTeacher Perceptions of Working Conditions\nLike salaries, working conditions also play a critical role in determining the supply of qualified teachers and in influencing their decisions about remaining in the profession. Research shows that safe environments, strong administrative leadership, collegial cooperation, high parental involvement, and sufficient learning resources can improve teacher effectiveness, enhance their commitment to school, and promote their job satisfaction (Darling-Hammond 2003; Guarino, Santibanez, and Daley 2006; McGrath and Princiotta 2005). Characteristics of a school's student body are also important in increasing teacher satisfaction and keeping them in the\n\nprofession. Students who go to school ready to learn, obey school rules, show respect for their teachers, and exhibit good learning behaviors not only can contribute to a positive school climate, but also can increase teacher enthusiasm, effectiveness, and commitment (Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin 2004; Kelly 2004; Stockard and Lehman 2004).\nSASS asked teachers whether they agreed with a number of statements about their school environments and working conditions. A majority of public middle and high school mathematics and science teachers expressed positive views of their school administrators' leadership and support, cooperation among colleagues, and availability of instructional\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 1-39\n\nFigure 1-19 1992\u00ad93 bachelor's degree recipients working in April 1994 in same or different occupation in 2003\n\nAll bachelor's degree recipients\nApril 1994 occupation\nMedical professionals\nK\u00ad12 teachers\nLegal professionals/ legal support personnel\nBusiness/financial services personnel Law enforcement/ military personnel Engineers, scientists,\nand laboratory research assistants\nComputer/ technical workers Other instructors/human services personnel\nEditors/writers/artists\nSales/service personnel\nBlue-collar workers\nBusiness owners/ other managers\nClerical workers, not including sales clerks\n\n34 54\n\n63 26\n\n61 21\n\n57 30\n\n46 44\n44 45\n43 50\n\nSame occupation\nDifferent occupation\n\n37 53\n\n27 57\n\n27 55\n\n18 71\n\n16 79\n\n16 71\n\n6 78\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80 100\n\nPercent\n\nNOTE: Those unemployed in 2003 or who had left labor force omitted from figure.\nSOURCE: Henke R, Cataldi E, Nevill S, Occupation Characteristics and Changes in Labor Force Status and Occupation Category: Comparing K\u00ad12 Teachers and College Graduates in Other Occupation Categories, National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), NCES 2007-170 (forthcoming).\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nresources (figure 1-20). Although teachers overall held generally positive perceptions of their school environments, these perceptions tended to be less prevalent in schools with more minority and poor students than in schools with fewer such students. This was particularly the case for teacher perceptions of parental support: 42%\u00ad44% of mathematics and science teachers in high-minority and high-poverty schools said that they had received a great deal of support from parents, compared with 67%\u00ad71% of their counterparts in lowminority and low-poverty schools.\nIn addition to school environments, teachers were asked to indicate whether particular student attitudes and behav-\n\niors were serious problems in their schools. The problem that public middle and high school mathematics and science teachers most often reported as serious concerned students coming to school unprepared to learn: 37% of the teachers viewed this issue as a serious problem in their schools (figure 1-21). They also frequently cited student apathy, student absenteeism, and student tardiness as serious problems. Teachers who taught in schools with high concentrations of minority and low-income students cited various student problems (especially that students came unprepared to learn) as serious more frequently than did those who taught in schools with low concentrations of such students.\nJob Satisfaction and Commitment to Teaching\nAlthough teachers are paid less than those in many comparable professions and sometimes have to work in environments that are less than ideal, the large majority of them are happy about being teachers. When asked whether they were satisfied with being a teacher at their school, 90% of public middle and high school teachers gave a positive answer (table 1-13). Responses from mathematics and science teachers were similar.\nWhen asked how long they planned to remain in teaching, many teachers responded that they planned to remain as long as they were able (42%) or until they were eligible for retirement (34%). Just 3% had definite plans to leave teaching as soon as possible. When asked whether they would become teachers again if they could start over, 66% indicated that they certainly or probably would, and only 5% responded they certainly would not. Responses from mathematics and science teachers to these questions resembled the overall patterns, although less science teachers (32%) than mathematics and other teachers (42% and 40%, respectively) said they would certainly go into teaching again.\nWorking conditions were strongly associated with teacher commitment to teaching. Regardless of what they taught, teachers who worked in a positive school environment tended to be more likely to consider teaching as a long-term career and to believe they would choose the profession again (appendix table 1-21). For example, among public middle and high school mathematics teachers who thought that their school administrators were supportive and encouraging, 48% said that they planned to continue teaching as long as they could, and 49% said that they would certainly become a teacher again if they could start over, compared with 22% and 20%, respectively, of those who did not share this perception about their school administrators.\nSummary\nCollege graduates who entered teaching were more likely to stay in that occupation than graduates who entered most other professions requiring comparable education, including legal professionals and legal support personnel, engineers, scientists, laboratory and research assistants, and computer\n\n\f1-40 \n\nChapter 1.

Between academic years 2003 and 2004, about 6%\u00ad7% of mathematics and science teachers in public schools left teaching, compared with 8% of all teachers. Regardless, public secondary schools continued to experience various degrees of difficulty in hiring mathematics and science teachers in recent years.\nTeacher salaries lagged behind those of many comparable professionals. These gaps have widened substantially in recent years, and about half of public middle and high school mathematics and science teachers were not satisfied with their pay. Although public school teachers generally had favorable perceptions of their working conditions, those in schools with high concentrations of minority or poor students viewed\n\ntheir work environments as less satisfactory. The findings that working conditions and pay were associated with teacher long-term commitment to teaching signify that high-minority and high-poverty schools may face greater challenges than others in recruiting and retaining qualified teachers.\nTransition to Higher Education\nMore and more high school students expect to attend college at some point, and many do so immediately after finishing high school.

However, despite heightened educational expectations and rising college enrollment rates, students from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds attend college at substantially lower rates than other students, and many of them discontinue their education before graduating from high school (Berkner and Chavez 1997; Laird et al. 2007).\nThis section presents several indicators related to student transitions from high school to college, including high school graduation rates in the United States and in other countries and long-term trends in immediate college enrollment rates among U.S. high school graduates. These indicators provide a broad picture of how effective the nation is in providing education at the secondary level and making higher education accessible to high school students.29\n\nCompletion of High School\nWho is counted as having completed high school in the United States? In a broad sense, a high school completer is anyone who has met the requirements of high school completion and received a regular diploma or earned an equivalent credential such as a GED certificate. Based on this definition, an NCES report (Laird et al. 2007) estimated that in 2005, 88% of those 18\u00ad24 years old not enrolled in high school had received a high school diploma or equivalency credential (figure 1-22). Between 1975 and 2005, completion rates increased in all racial/ethnic groups. The rate for blacks increased faster than that for whites, narrowing the gaps between the two groups. However, although the Hispanic completion rate increased overall between 1975 and 2005, the gap between Hispanics and whites remained wide.\n\n\f1-42 \n\nChapter 1.

To do so, they have been focusing on on-time graduation rates and counting only students with regular diplomas as graduates (Seastrom et al. 2006a; Swanson 2003; WestEd 2004). To examine on-time graduation rates, researchers used the percentage of the incoming freshman class that graduates with a regular diploma 4 years later as a measure (Seastrom et al. 2006b).31 Based on this measure, it was estimated that 74% of public high school students who entered ninth grade in academic year 1999 graduat-\n\ned with a regular diploma 4 years later in academic year 2003 (table 1-14). On-time graduation rates changed little from 2000 to 2004, staying in the range of 72%\u00ad74%. (See sidebar \"International Comparisons of High School Completion.\")\nEnrollment in Postsecondary Education\nOn completing high school, young adults make critical choices about the next stage of their lives.

From 1975 to 2005, the immediate enrollment rate increased faster for females than for males. Much of the growth in the overall rate for females was because of increases between 1981 and 1997 in the rate of females attending 4-year institutions. During this period, the rate at which females enrolled at 4-year institutions increased faster than it did for their male counterparts, and faster than for either males or females at 2-year institutions.\nAlthough the growth in immediate college enrollment over the past three decades looks impressive, wide gaps by student socioeconomic background persisted. In each year between\n\n1975 and 2005, low-income students lagged considerably behind their high-income peers in college enrollment (appendix table 1-22). Wide gaps also existed among racial/ethnic groups, with black and Hispanic students trailing far behind their white peers. Enrollment rates differed by parent education, as well, although students whose parents had only a high school education increased their enrollments considerably.\nThe type of institution was also related to student racial/ ethnic and family background. Berkner and Chavez (1997) found that the proportion of 1992 high school graduates who enrolled in 4-year colleges and universities increased with family income and the level of their parents' education. Four-year college enrollment rates were also higher among white and Asian/Pacific Islander students than among black and Hispanic students. On the other hand, Hispanic students and those from low-income and less-educated families were more likely to attend 2-year institutions after high school graduation. Persistent inequality on many indicators of postsecondary education (e.g., gaining access and attaining a degree) is discussed extensively in chapter 2.\nSummary\nOver the past three decades, high school completion rates have been increasing gradually and the white-black gaps in completion rates have been narrowing. However, on-time graduation rates, which measure the rates at which high school freshmen graduate with a regular diploma 4 years later, remained in the range of 72%-74% in the early 2000s. Although more and more students choose to enroll in college right after high school, students from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds continue to attend college at substantially lower rates than their more advantaged classmates.\n\nFigure 1-23 High school graduates enrolled in college in October after completing high school, by sex and type of institution: 1975\u00ad2005\nPercent\n\n80\n\nTotal\n\nFemale\n\n60 Male\n\nFemale, 4-year\n40 Male, 4-year\nFemale, 2-year\n20 Male, 2-year\n\n0 1975 1977\n\n1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001\n\n2003 2005\n\nNOTE: Includes students ages 16\u00ad24 years completing high school in survey year.

Elementary and Secondary Education\n\nInternational Comparisons of High School Completion\nHow does the United States compare with other nations in terms of the rates at which young people graduate from high school? A 2006 report from the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) found that the United States is falling behind other industrialized nations on this indicator (OECD 2006). In 2004, the high school graduation rate was 75% in the United States, which was lower than the overall average rate of 81% for the 22 OECD countries with available data (figure 1-24). The United States ranked 17th in the overall high school graduation rate among OECD countries, behind such top-ranked countries as Norway, Germany, South Korea, Ireland, Japan, and Denmark.*\n* One reason for the lower U.S. rate is that the U.S. high school student population may be more inclusive than in some OECD countries. In other words, some OECD countries may have more students dropping out before entering high school and therefore have a more selective high school student population than does the United States.\nConclusion\nWhen they start kindergarten, students in the United States already exhibit differing mathematics knowledge and skills, and most of the achievement gaps between groups either remain or grow over the years students spend in school. Mathematics and science performance gaps widened between racial/ethnic groups, between students from financially disadvantaged and advantaged families, and between students whose mothers differ in educational attainment.\nHowever, trends between 1990 and 2005 indicate rising test scores, particularly in mathematics in grades 4 and 8 (measured with cross-sectional data). The rise in scores occurred across the board: for both sexes, across racial/ethnic groups, and for students in all ranges of performance. Notably, some mathematics achievement discrepancies narrowed; for example, the difference between white and black fourth grade student scores decreased. Average science scores on fourth grade tests also increased since 1996 (particularly those in lower and middle score ranges), but science achievement in grades 8 and 12 has been resistant to improvement.\nAs educators and policymakers strive to improve student learning, they continue to make changes in schooling resources and school environments. Coursetaking and content standards, teacher qualifications, and continuing professional development for teachers are among the primary elements featured in efforts to promote student achievement.\nCoursetaking and Content Standards\nStates have been increasing academic course requirements for high school graduation since the 1980s. By 2006, most states required 3 years of both mathematics and science\n\nFigure 1-24 High school graduation rates, by OECD country: 2004\n\nNorway Germany South Korea\nIreland Japan Denmark Finland Switzerland Czech Republic Hungary Iceland Slovak Republic\nItaly OECD average\nFrance Poland Sweden United States New Zealand Luxembourg\nSpain Turkey Mexico\n\n100 99 96 92 91 90 90 89 87 86 84 83 81 81 81 79 78 75 75 69 66 53 38\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nPercent\n\nOECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\n\nNOTES: High school graduation rate is percentage of population at typical upper secondary graduation age (e.g., 18 years old in United States) completing upper secondary education programs.

Coursework standards have expanded in the past decade or so to require specific courses (such as algebra) and to enhance the rigor of course content.\nCoursetaking Trends\nTrends from 1990 to 2005 show higher proportions of students completing advanced mathematics and science courses with growth especially strong in mathematics. Students also increased course completions in advanced biology, chemistry, and physics. Even so, completion rates were relatively low in 2005 for most of these advanced course categories. For the AP/IB courses, rates doubled for some and increased substantially for others; still, the most common AP/IB course, calculus, was completed by less than 10% of 2005 graduates.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 1-45\n\nTeacher Preparation and Qualifications\nMost public school teachers have a bachelor's degree and are fully certified. Majorities of beginning mathematics and science teachers in public middle and high schools also participated in practice teaching before starting their first teaching job and were confident of their ability to handle its challenges. However, practice teaching declined in recent years by about 8\u00ad10 percentage points, even though participation contributes to new teachers' confidence. In high schools, large majorities of mathematics and science teachers were teaching in field; that is, they had a postsecondary major or certification in that field. However, in middle schools, about one-half of mathematics and biology science teachers and two-thirds of physical science teachers lacked these in-field qualifications. Across all mathematics and science fields, a pattern of unequal access to the most highly qualified teachers (including those with more than a few years of teaching experience) was the rule, favoring lowminority and low-poverty schools.\nParticipation in Professional Development\nMost beginning teachers participated in induction programs or worked closely with a mentor teacher during their first year of teaching. Participation in professional development was also widespread, most often on a teacher's subject matter or on using computers for instruction. The most common formats were workshops, conferences, and training sessions. Overall, the amount of time that most teachers devoted to professional development did not reach the levels recommended by researchers.\nTeacher Supply, Salaries, Working Conditions, and Job Satisfaction\nAttrition from teaching is typically lower than from other professions, and attrition rates for mathematics and science teachers have mostly leveled off in recent years. Nevertheless, public secondary schools continued to experience some difficulty filling teacher vacancies in mathematics and physical sciences, and to a lesser degree, in biology/life sciences. Overall, a majority of public school teachers were satisfied with their jobs and planned to remain in teaching as long as they could. Science and mathematics teacher pay still falls behind that of many professionals with comparable education, even more so in recent years. Although dissatisfaction with pay is on the rise, public school teachers had mostly favorable perceptions of their working conditions.\nHigh School Graduation Rates and Enrollment in Postsecondary Education\nSince 1975, high school completion rates have increased slightly. In 2005, among 18\u00ad24-year-olds not enrolled in high school, nearly 90% held either a high school diploma or an equivalency credential. However, the on-time graduation rate changed little from 2000 to 2004, staying in the range\n\nof 72%\u00ad74%. Increasingly students are entering postsecondary education directly after high school. Between 1975 and 2005, the percentage of students ages 16\u00ad24 enrolling in a 2or 4-year institution in the fall following high school graduation rose from 51% to 69%.\nNotes\n1. Differences between two estimates were tested using the Student's t statistic to minimize the chances of concluding that a difference exists based on the sample when no true difference exists in the population from which the sample was drawn. Setting the significance level at 0.05 indicates that a reported difference would occur by chance no more than once in 20 samples when there was no actual difference between the population means.\n2. In the 2004 followup for the ECLS kindergarten class of fall 1998, 86% of cohort members were in fifth grade, 14% were in a lower grade, and less than 1% were in a higher grade. For the sake of simplicity, students in the ECLS followups are referred to by the expected grade; that is, they are referred to as first graders in the spring 2000 assessment, as third graders in the spring 2003 assessment, and as fifth graders in the spring 2004 assessment.\n3. The poverty status variable in ECLS is based on information provided by the parent. The variable is derived from household income and total number of household members (Princiotta, Flanagan, and Germino Hausken 2006). Federal poverty thresholds are used to define households below the poverty level. For example, if a household contained two members, and the household income was lower than $12,015, the student was considered to be living below the poverty threshold.\n4. Socioeconomic status was based on five equally weighted components: father's education, mother's education, family income, father's occupational prestige score, and mother's occupational prestige score.\n5. NAEP consists of three assessment programs. The long-term trend assessment is based on nationally representative samples of 9-, 13-, and 17-year-olds. It has remained the same since it was first given in 1969 in science and 1973 in mathematics, permitting analyses of trends over three decades. A second testing program, the national or main NAEP, assesses national samples of 4th, 8th, and 12th grade students. The national assessments are updated periodically to reflect contemporary standards of what students should know and be able to do in a subject. The third program, the state NAEP, is similar to the national NAEP but involves representative samples of students from participating states.\n6. These recent trends are based on data from the national NAEP program. The current national mathematics assessment for grades 4 and 8 was first administered in 1990 and was given again in 1992, 1996, 2000, 2003, and 2005. In 2003, only fourth and eighth grade students were assessed. The current grade 12 mathematics assessment has only been administered once: in 2005. Trend analyses for grade\n\n\f1-46 \n\nChapter 1. Elementary and Secondary Education\n\n12 mathematics are therefore not available. The current national science assessment was first administered in 1996 and was given again in 2000 and 2005.\n7. Although the NAEP program collects information about eligibility for the free or reduced-price lunch program for grade 12 students, it does not report these data. Because other reasons for not applying for school lunch programs (including food preferences, ability to buy lunch outside school, and wanting to avoid embarrassment) generally increase with student age, program eligibility becomes an increasingly unreliable indicator of poverty at higher grade levels. For example, approximately 35%\u00ad45% of fourth grade and 30%\u00ad40% of eighth grade public school students have been eligible in recent years for the subsidized lunch program. In contrast, only about 15%\u00ad25% of 12th grade public school students have been eligible (determined using the online NAEP Data Explorer tool at http://www.nces. ed.gov/nationsreportcard/naepdata/). The relatively low percentage of grade 12 students noted as eligible for the program raises concerns that it is not a reliable indicator of low family income for these students.\n8. Insufficient sample size in 1990 for Asian/Pacific Islanders and American Indians/Alaska Natives precluded calculation of reliable estimates for this group. Increases in average scores for Asian/Pacific Islanders in grades 4 and 8 were observed between 2003 and 2005. Scores increased for grade 4 American Indians/Alaska Natives between 2003 and 2005, but not for grade 8 American Indians/Alaska Natives.\n9. Many states developed initial standards for at least some subjects starting after about 1980, while others revised existing standards and/or curricular guidelines; in some states both of these activities occurred.\n10. Although effects were somewhat different for men and women, Trusty's analysis also adjusted for variables such as previous test scores, previous course completions, and confidence about their mathematics and science skills. These factors sometimes interact in both directions, with strong performance in early grades often leading to greater selfconfidence and interest in the subjects, which in turn lead to greater coursetaking, which may increase performance, and so on. Studies may not measure other relevant characteristics like students' motivation and career aspirations.\n11. The fairly flat pattern for trigonometry/algebra III does not necessarily mean that fewer students studied these topics; some schools may have reconfigured courses so that rather than providing a full semester of trigonometry, for example, they may include that material in a precalculus or other course.\n12. Except for biology, AP/IB science course data are available only for 2000 and 2005.\n13. In some course categories, the difference between Asian/Pacific Islander and white graduates was not significant, whereas in others, differences between Asians/Pacific Islanders and one or more of the other groups proved to be not significant. These findings are likely due in part to large standard errors associated with smaller population groups.\n\n14. Poverty rate is defined as the percentage of students in the school who were eligible for the national subsidized lunch program. For reasons explained above, school lunch program eligibility can be an unreliable indicator of individual families' poverty, particularly for high school students. It is used here as a rough proxy for poverty at the school level because it is the only available measure, but the caveat stands.\n15. NCLB defines a highly qualified elementary or secondary school teacher as someone who holds a bachelor's degree and full state-approved teaching certificate or license (excluding emergency, temporary, and provisional certificates) and who demonstrates subject-matter competency in each academic subject taught by having an undergraduate or graduate major or its equivalent in the subject; passing a test on the subject; holding an advanced teaching certificate in the subject; or meeting some other state-approved criteria. NCLB requires that new elementary school teachers must pass tests in subject-matter knowledge and teaching skills in mathematics, reading, writing, and other areas of the basic elementary school curriculum. New middle and high school teachers either must pass a rigorous state test in each academic subject they teach or have the equivalent of an undergraduate or graduate major or advanced certification in their fields.\n16. Teacher quality can include many characteristics that are not discussed here, such as teachers' commitment to the profession; sense of responsibility for student learning; and ability to motivate students, manage classroom behavior, maximize instructional time, and diagnose and remedy students' learning difficulties (Goldhaber and Anthony 2004; McCaffrey et al. 2003; Rice 2003). These characteristics are rarely examined in nationally representative surveys because they are difficult and costly to measure.\n17. Research on how elementary school teachers are prepared to teach mathematics and science is emerging but limited (National Research Council 2007). Based on an extensive literature review on science education, the National Research Council (2007) concludes that K\u00ad8 teachers had limited training in science education and insufficient knowledge of science. However, some evidence suggests that K\u00ad5 teachers are confident about their ability to teach their subjects including mathematics and science (Weiss et al. 2003). Much more research is needed to increase understanding about elementary teacher preparation for teaching mathematics and science.\n18. To simplify the discussion, schools in which 10% or fewer of the students were eligible for the federal free and reduced-price lunch program are called low-poverty schools; and schools in which more than 50% of the students were eligible are called high-poverty schools. Similarly, low-minority schools are those in which 5% or fewer of the students were members of a minority, and high-minority schools are those in which more than 45% of the students were members of a minority.\n19. In general, probationary certification is awarded to those who have completed all the requirements except for a\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 1-47\n\nprobationary teaching period. Provisional or temporary certification is awarded to those who still have requirements to meet. Emergency certification is issued to those with insufficient teacher preparation who must complete a regular certification program in order to continue teaching (Henke et al. 1997).\n20. Practice teaching (also called student teaching) offers prospective teachers hands-on classroom experience that allows them to transform the knowledge learned from coursework into teaching exercises in the classroom. Currently, 39 states require public school teachers to complete a minimum of 5 weeks of practice teaching, through either traditional teacher education programs or licensure requirements (Editorial Projects in Education 2006).\n21. It should be noted that induction programs have great variability in terms of program goals, content, duration, and format. This variability cannot be addressed by using the SASS data.\n22. Similar results have been reported elsewhere (Choy, Chen, and Bugarin 2006; Scotchmer, McGrath, and Coder 2005). This finding suggests that schools and districts, and perhaps teachers themselves, were attempting to address the needs of teachers in high-minority and high-poverty schools.\n23. The amount of time teachers devoted to professional development was generally not associated with schools' minority enrollment and poverty levels.\n24. Teacher participation in various formats of professional development was generally not significantly associated with schools' minority enrollment and poverty levels.\n25. Teacher participation in these activities was generally not significantly related to schools' minority enrollment and poverty levels.\n26. For example, these explanations include the retirement of an aging teaching force, increased student enrollments, reforms such as the reduction of class sizes, high rates of attrition, and lack of qualified candidates willing to enter the profession (Broughman and Rollefson 2000; Howard 2003; Hussar 1999).\n27. Teacher shortages occur in a labor market when demand is greater than supply. This can be the result of either increases in demand or decreases in supply or of both simultaneously (Guarino, Santibanez, and Daley 2006).\n28. Teaching vacancies in foreign languages, English as a second language, and special education were also difficult to fill in secondary schools, according to SASS data.\n29. The 2004 and 2006 editions of Science and Engineering Indicators included an indicator of college remediation. However, this indicator cannot be updated for this edition because there were no new data available at the time of preparation for this chapter.\n30. NCLB requires that states include graduation rates in determining adequate yearly progress and calls for measurement of on-time graduation that explicitly excludes GEDs and other types of nonregular diplomas from the counts of graduates.\n\n31. Researchers examined several proxy measures of ontime graduation rates (Seastrom et al. 2006a). Although none of them is as accurate as the on-time graduation rate computed from a cohort of students using student record data, one of the methods, called Averaged Freshman Graduation Rates (AFGR), most closely approximates the true cohort rate and is used here. AFGR measures the percentage of an incoming freshman class that graduates with a regular diploma 4 years later. The incoming freshman class size is estimated by averaging the enrollment of 8th graders 5 years earlier, enrollment of 9th graders 4 years earlier, and enrollment of 10th graders 3 years earlier. This averaging is intended to adjust for higher grade retention rates in the 9th grade.\nGlossary\nStudent Learning in Mathematics and Science\nEligibility for National School Lunch Program: Students' eligibility for this program, which provides free or reduced-price lunches, is a commonly used indicator for family poverty. Eligibility information is part of the administrative data kept by schools and is based on parent-reported family income and family size.\nLongitudinal studies: Researchers follow the same group of students over a period of years, such as from kindergarten through fifth grade. These studies can show achievement gains in a particular subject from grade to grade.\nRepeating cross-sectional studies: This type of research focuses on how a specific group of students performs in a particular year, then looks at the performance of a similar group of students at a later point in time. An example would be comparing fourth graders in 1990 to fourth graders in 2005.\nScale score: Scale scores place students on a continuous achievement scale based on their overall performance on the assessment. Each assessment program develops its own scales. For example, NAEP used a scale of 0\u00ad500 for the mathematics assessment and a scale of 0\u00ad300 for the science assessment, and the ECLS mathematics scale ranged from 0 to 153.\nStandards and Student Coursetaking\nAdvanced Placement: Courses that teach college-level material and skills to high school students who can earn college credits by demonstrating advanced proficiency on a final course exam. The curricula and exams for AP courses, available for a wide range of academic subjects, are developed by the College Board.\nCore subjects: Fundamental academic subjects that students spend the most time on and are the focus of coursetaking requirements and achievement tests: mathematics, science, English/language arts, and social studies. Computer science and foreign language are sometimes included in the category.\n\n\f1-48 \n\nChapter 1. Elementary and Secondary Education\n\nInternational Baccalaureate: An internationally recognized pre-university academic subject course designed for high school students.\nPoverty rate: A school's poverty rate is defined as the percentage of students eligible for subsidized lunches through the National School Lunch Program. It is considered a less accurate measure of family poverty at higher grade levels.\nMathematics and Science Teacher Quality\nHigh schools: Schools that have at least one grade higher than 8 and no grade in K\u00ad6.\nIn-field and out-of-field teachers: This report defines in-field teachers as those who had either a college major or full certification (i.e., regular, advanced, or probationary certification) in their main teaching assignment field or both and out-of-field teachers as those who had neither a college major nor full certification in their main teaching assignment field, a related field, or general education.\nMain teaching assignment field: The field in which teachers teach the most classes in school.\nMajor: A field of study in which an individual has taken substantial academic coursework at the postsecondary level, implying that the individual has substantial knowledge of the academic discipline or subject area.\nMiddle schools: Schools that have any of grades 5\u00ad8, and no grade lower than 5 and no grade higher than 8.\nPractice teaching: Programs designed to offer prospective teachers hands-on classroom practice. Practice teaching is often a requirement for completing an educational degree or state certification, or both.\nSecondary schools: Schools that have any of grades 7\u00ad12 and no grade in K\u00ad6.\nTeaching certification: A license or certificate awarded to teachers by the state to teach in a public school. The SASS surveys include five types of certification: 1) regular or standard state certification or advanced professional certificate; 2) probationary certificate issued to persons who satisfy all requirements except the completion of a probationary period; 3) provisional certificate issued to persons who are still participating in what the state calls an \"alternative certification program;\" 4) temporary certificate issued to persons who need some additional college coursework, student teaching, and/or passage of a test before regular certification can be obtained; and 5) emergency certificate issued to persons with insufficient teacher preparation who must complete a regular certification program in order to continue teaching.\nProfessional Development of Mathematics and Science Teachers\nProfessional development: In-service training activities designed to help teachers improve their subject-matter knowledge, acquire new teaching skills, and stay informed about changing policies and practices.\nTeacher induction: Programs designed at the school, local, or state level for beginning teachers in their first few\n\nyears of teaching. The purpose of the programs is to help new teachers improve professional practice, deepen their understanding of teaching, and prevent early attrition. One key component of such programs is that new teachers are paired with mentors or other experienced teachers to receive advice, instruction, and support.\nTeacher Salaries, Working Conditions, and Job Satisfaction\nTeacher attrition: Teachers leaving the teaching profession for another occupation.\nTeaching vacancy: Open teaching positions needing to be filled.\nTransition to Higher Education\nPostsecondary education: The provision of formal instructional programs with a curriculum designed primarily for students who have completed the requirements for a high school diploma or its equivalent. This includes programs with an academic, vocational, and continuing professional education purpose, and excludes vocational and adult basic education programs.\nReferences\nAchieve, Inc. 2004.

Higher Education in Science and Engineering\n\nHighlights\n\nFinancing Higher Education\nTuition increases at colleges and universities in the United States have grown rapidly for the past two decades, although the rate of increase slowed in the past few years.\n Compared with the previous year, average tuition and fees rose 6.3% for academic year 2006\u00ad07 for in-state students in public 4-year colleges, 5.9% for students in private 4-year colleges, and 4.1% for students in public 2-year colleges.\n As state spending on higher education rose from FY 2005 to FY 2007, the rate of tuition increase at public 4-year colleges slowed.\nLevels of debt for both undergraduate and graduate education are high.\n Among 2003\u00ad04 bachelor's degree recipients in all fields who took out loans, the median level of debt was $19,300.\n At the time of doctorate conferral, about half of 2005 S&E doctorate recipients reported having debt from either their undergraduate or graduate education: 27% reported undergraduate debt and 33% reported graduate debt.\n High levels of educational debt were most associated with graduate education: 10% of S&E doctorate recipients had more than $50,000 of graduate debt but only 1% had similar amounts of undergraduate debt.\nIn 2005, about 21% of full-time S&E graduate students received more than half of their financial support for graduate education from the federal government.\n Most (69%) S&E graduate students primarily funded by the federal government are funded under grants to universities for academic research.\n Fellowships and traineeships fund 22% of federally funded full-time S&E graduate students.\n Federal support for graduate education reaches relatively more students in the physical sciences; earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences; agricultural sciences; biological sciences; and engineering. Relatively few students receive federal support in mathematics, computer sciences, social sciences, psychology, and medical/other life sciences.\nHigher Education Faculty\nThe types of assignments and methods used to grade students vary by discipline.\n Most (83%) instructional faculty use lecture/discussion as the primary instructional method for undergraduate classes.\n\n More than half of natural sciences and engineering faculty require their undergraduate students to participate in group projects (compared with 48% of social and behavioral sciences faculty), and more than 60% require lab assignments (compared with 24% of social and behavioral sciences faculty).\n The use of term papers increased in all disciplines between 1992 and 2003. Social and behavioral sciences faculty are more likely than faculty in other S&E fields to require written work of their students: 85% of social and behavioral sciences faculty require term papers of their undergraduate students compared with 76% of agricultural/biological/health sciences faculty and 57% of physical/mathematics/computer sciences/engineering faculty.\nHigher Education Enrollments\nEnrollment in U.S. higher education is projected to continue rising because of increases in the U.S. college-age population.\n Enrollment rose from 12.7 million in 1986 to 16.9 million in 2004.\n The number of individuals ages 20\u00ad24 in the U.S. population is projected to rise through 2050 although the demographic composition will shift.\n Increased enrollment in higher education is projected to come mainly from minority groups, particularly Asians and Hispanics.\nS&E graduate enrollment in the United States continued to rise, reaching a new peak of 583,200 in fall 2005.\n Following a long period of growth, graduate enrollment in S&E declined in the latter half of the 1990s then increased steadily since 1999.\n In fall 2005, graduate enrollment increased in most S&E fields except computer sciences and engineering.\n Graduate enrollment in computer sciences and engineering decreased in the past 2 years because of declining foreign student enrollment.\nTotal enrollment of foreign S&E graduate students dropped in fall 2005 for the second year in a row, but first-time full-time enrollment increased in 2005 after 3 years of decline.\n S&E graduate students on temporary visas increased from 20% to 25% of all S&E graduate students from 1985 to 2005.\n The number of first-time full-time S&E graduate students with temporary visas declined 18% from 2001 through 2004 but increased 4% in fall 2005.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 2-5\n\nHigher Education Degrees\nThe number of S&E bachelor's and master's degrees awarded annually continued to rise, reaching record highs in 2005.  The numbers of S&E bachelor's and master's degrees\nawarded reached new peaks of 466,000 and 120,000, respectively, in 2005.  Most S&E fields (except computer sciences) experienced increases in the number of degrees awarded in 2005.  In computer sciences, the number of bachelor's degrees increased sharply from 1998 to 2004 but decreased in 2005.\nWomen earned more than half of all bachelor's degrees and S&E bachelor's degrees in 2005 but major variations persist among fields.  Women earned more than half of bachelor's degrees in psy-\nchology (78%), agricultural sciences (51%), biological sciences (62%), chemistry (52%), and social sciences (54%).  Men earned the majority of bachelor's degrees awarded in engineering (80%), computer sciences (78%), and physics (79%).\nBlacks, Hispanics, and American Indians/Alaska Natives choose S&E fields at the same rate as whites.  Among bachelor's degree recipients, about one-third of\nthe degrees earned by every racial/ethnic group (except Asians/Pacific Islanders) are in S&E. Asians/Pacific Islanders, as a group, earn almost half of their bachelor's degrees in S&E.\nStudents in the United States on temporary visas earned only a small share (4%) of S&E bachelor's degrees in 2005.  The number of S&E bachelor's degrees awarded to stu-\ndents on temporary visas increased over the past two decades from 14,100 in 1985 to 18,400 in 2005.  In 2005, these students earned 8% of bachelor's degrees awarded in computer sciences and 7% in engineering.\nMaster's degrees in S&E fields increased from 70,600 in 1985 to 120,000 in 2005.  Increases in master's degrees occurred in most major\nS&E fields.  Master's degrees in engineering and physical sciences de-\ncreased from 1995 to 2002 but increased in recent years, and master's degrees in computer sciences generally increased through 2004 but dropped in 2005.\n\nThe number and percentage of master's degrees awarded to women in all major S&E fields (with the exception of computer sciences) have increased since 1985.\n Since 1985, the number of S&E master's degrees earned by women more than doubled, rising from 22,300 in 1985 to 53,000 in 2005.\n In computer sciences, the number of master's degrees awarded to women increased through 2004 but dropped in 2005, and the percentage of degrees awarded to women dropped from 34% in 2001 to 29% in 2005.\n The number of master's degrees earned by men grew more slowly from 48,200 in 1985 to 67,000 in 2005, with most of the growth occurring between 2002 and 2004.\nThe number of S&E master's degrees awarded increased for all racial/ethnic groups from 1985 to 2005.\n The proportion of master's degrees in S&E fields earned by U.S. citizen and permanent resident racial and ethnic minorities increased over the past two decades.\n Asians/Pacific Islanders accounted for 7% of master's degrees in 2005, an increase from 5% in 1985. Blacks and Hispanics also registered gains during this period (from 3% to 6% for blacks and from 2% to 4% for Hispanics). American Indians/Alaska Natives earned 0.4% of S&E master's degrees in 1985 and 2005.\n The percentage of S&E master's degrees earned by white students fell from 68% in 1985 to 47% in 2005. Meanwhile, the percentage of degrees earned by minorities and temporary residents increased, and the number of S&E master's degrees earned by white students dropped from 1996 to 2002 before increasing again.\nForeign students make up a much higher proportion of S&E master's degree recipients than they do of bachelor's or associate's degree recipients.\n During the past two decades, the share of S&E master's degrees earned by temporary residents rose from 19% to 28%.\n S&E master's degrees awarded to students on temporary visas rose from approximately 12,500 in 1985 to about 33,500 in 2005 and increased in most S&E fields during that period.\nThe number of S&E doctorates awarded by U.S. academic institutions reached a new peak of almost 30,000 in 2005.\n The largest growth in the number of doctorate awards was in engineering and the biological and agricultural sciences.\n Virtually all of the growth reflected higher numbers of S&E doctorates earned by temporary visa holders.\nStudents on temporary visas earned more than a third (36%) of all S&E doctorates awarded in the United States in 2005.\n\n\f2-6 \n\nChapter 2. Higher Education in Science and Engineering\n\n The number of S&E doctorates earned by temporary residents rose to a new peak of 10,800 in 2005.\n Temporary residents earned half or more of all U.S. doctorates in engineering, mathematics, computer sciences, physics, and economics in 2005.\nMost foreign recipients of U.S. S&E doctorates plan to stay in the United States after graduation.\n Among 2002\u00ad05 graduates, 74% of foreign S&E doctorate recipients with known plans reported they planned to stay in the United States and 49% had accepted firm offers of employment.\n The percentage of students who had firm plans to remain in the United States dropped after 2001, then increased in 2005.\n More than 90% of 2002\u00ad05 U.S. S&E doctoral recipients from China and 88% of those from India reported plans to stay in the United States, and 60% and 63%, respectively, reported accepting firm offers for employment or postdoctoral research in the United States. The percentages of U.S. S&E doctorate recipients from China and India with definite plans to stay in the United States dropped from 1998\u00ad2001 to 2002\u00ad05. The decreases were almost entirely among doctorate recipients in computer sciences and engineering.\nThe number of doctorate recipients with S&E postdoctoral appointments at U.S. universities more than doubled in the past two decades.\n Temporary visa holders accounted for 55% of S&E postdocs in academic institutions in fall 2005.\n More than two-thirds of S&E postdocs in academic institutions are in the biological, medical, and other life sciences fields.\n\nGlobal S&E Education\nEducational attainment of the U.S. population has long been among the highest in the world, but other countries are catching up.\n The United States continues to have the highest percentage of the population ages 25\u00ad64 with a bachelor's degree or higher. However, among the population ages 25\u00ad34, the United States (30%) lags behind Norway (37%), Israel (34%), the Netherlands (32%), and South Korea (31%) in the percentage with at least a bachelor's degree.\n The United States ranks 4th (behind Russia, Israel, and Canada) in the population ages 25\u00ad64 with any postsecondary degree (including 2-year and 4-year or higher degrees), and it ranks 10th (behind Russia, Canada, Japan, Israel, South Korea, Sweden, Belgium, Ireland, and Norway) in the population ages 25\u00ad34 with any postsecondary degree.\nGlobal competition for foreign students increased in the past two decades.\n The U.S. share of foreign students declined in recent years, although the United States remains the predominant destination for foreign students (accounting for 22% of internationally mobile students in 2004).\n The United Kingdom, Germany, and France also attract large numbers of foreign students, accounting for 11%, 10%, and 9%, respectively, of internationally mobile students in 2004.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 2-7\n\nIntroduction\nChapter Overview\nThe importance of higher education in S&E is increasingly recognized around the world for its impact on innovation and economic development. S&E higher education provides the advanced skills needed for a competitive workforce and, particularly in the case of graduate S&E education, the research necessary for innovation.1\nA number of key influences shape the nature of U.S. S&E higher education and its standing in the world. In recent years, demographic trends and world events contributed to changes in both the numbers and types of students participating in U.S. higher education. After declining in the 1990s, the U.S. college-age population is currently increasing and is projected to increase for the next decade. The composition of the college-age population is also changing, with Asians and Hispanics becoming an increasing share of the population. Recent enrollment and degree trends, to some extent, reflect these changes. For example, graduate S&E enrollment and the number of S&E degrees at all levels are up, and the proportion of S&E degrees earned by minorities is increasing.\nIn the 1990s, the number of foreign students coming to the United States for higher education study, particularly from countries in Asia, increased substantially. Increases in foreign students contributed to most of the growth in overall S&E graduate enrollments in recent years. After September 11, 2001, the number of foreign students coming to the United States for graduate education dropped for several years, but these numbers increased in 2005 (although they have not yet regained earlier levels).\nFinally, global competition in higher education is increasing. Although the United States has historically been a world leader in providing broad access to higher education and in attracting foreign students, many other countries are expanding their own higher education systems, providing expanded educational access to their own population, and attracting larger numbers of foreign students. The effects of these trends on foreign student enrollment in U.S. institutions remain to be seen.\nChapter Organization\nThis chapter describes characteristics of the U.S. higher education system as well as trends in higher education worldwide. It begins with characteristics of U.S. higher education institutions providing S&E education, including trends in tuition and fees, financial support, and debt levels. Trends in student involvement in higher education, including freshmen interest and enrollment in S&E fields, degree completions, and postdoctoral study are discussed along with trends by sex, race/ethnicity, and citizenship. The chapter highlights the flows of foreign students into the United States by country and their intentions to remain in this country. The chapter then presents various international higher education indicators, including comparative S&E degree production in\n\nseveral world regions and the growing dependence of all industrialized countries on foreign S&E students. Additional state data on tuition charges, enrollment, and degrees granted are available in chapter 8, State Indicators.\nThe U.S. Higher Education System\nHigher education in S&E has been receiving increasing attention as an important component contributing to the nation's maintenance of a strong economic position in the world (NSB 2003). A number of recent reports (AACU 2007; BEST 2004; COSEPUP 2006; NAE 2005; NSB 2004a; Project Kaleidoscope 2006) called for increasing the quantity, quality, and diversity of the students studying and graduating in S&E fields.\nInstitutions Providing S&E Education\nThe U.S. higher education system consists of a large number of academic institutions and a wide variety of institution types that provide broad access, advance the frontiers of knowledge, and strive to meet students' changing needs through new forms of teaching and learning (U.S. Department of Education 2006). Among the approximately 4,300 postsecondary degree-granting institutions in the United States in the 2005\u00ad06 academic year, 71% offered bachelor's or higher degrees and 29% offered associate's degrees as the highest degree awarded (NCES 2007). In 2005, these institutions awarded more than 2 million bachelor's or higher degrees (about 614,000 in S&E) plus about 641,000 associate's degrees (46,000 in S&E).\nResearch Institutions Research institutions, although few in number, are the\nleading producers of S&E bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees. In 2005, research institutions (i.e., doctorate-granting institutions with very high research activity) awarded 69% of S&E doctoral degrees, 42% of master's degrees, and 36% of bachelor's degrees in S&E fields. (See sidebar \"Carnegie Classification of Academic Institutions.\") Master's colleges and universities awarded another 28% of S&E bachelor's degrees and 24% of S&E master's degrees in 2005. Baccalaureate colleges were the source of relatively few S&E bachelor's degrees (13%) (appendix table 2-1).\nCommunity Colleges Community colleges figure broadly in answering the na-\ntion's need for well-prepared technicians, and as the initial (and sometimes only) college experience for many students who are the first in their family to seek education beyond high school (Adelman 2005) or who have limited funds or ability to leave a given geographic area for a college education. Community colleges (also known as associate's colleges and 2-year institutions) are the largest segment of the higher education enterprise in the United States. In 2004, they enrolled 6.3 million students, about 60% of whom were enrolled part time.\n\n\f2-8 \n\nChapter 2. Higher Education in Science and Engineering\n\nCarnegie Classification of Academic Institutions\nThe 2005 version of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching's basic classification scheme for colleges and universities is more complex than previous versions and includes subcategories, new names, and new criteria for categories. Academic institutions are categorized primarily on the basis of highest degree conferred, level of degree production, and research activity. In this report, several categories have been aggregated for statistical purposes. The following are characteristics of those groups:\nDoctorate-granting universities include institutions that award at least 20 doctoral degrees per year. They include three subgroups based on level of research activity: very high research activity, high research activity, and doctoral/research universities.\nMaster's colleges and universities include institutions that award at least 50 master's degrees and fewer than 20 doctoral degrees per year.\nBaccalaureate colleges include institutions in which baccalaureate degrees represent at least 10% of all undergraduate degrees and that award fewer than 50 master's degrees or 20 doctoral degrees per year.\nAssociate's colleges include institutions in which all degrees are at the associate's level or bachelor's degrees account for less than 10% of all undergraduate degrees.\nSpecial focus institutions are those in which at least 75% of degrees are concentrated in a single field or a set of related fields.\nTribal colleges are colleges and universities that are members of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium.\nAlthough community colleges are not major sources of S&E degrees, they provide S&E coursework that is affordable, remedial, and potentially transferable, and they play a role in developing public scientific literacy. They also serve as a bridge for students who go on to major in S&E fields at 4-year institutions. Almost 29% of students who began at a community college in the 1995\u00ad96 academic year had transferred to 4-year institutions as of 2001 (Berkner, He, and Cataldi 2003).\nSeveral efforts are underway to improve community college students' transition to 4-year institutions. Four-year institutions and private foundations are directing a portion of their entering student scholarship funds and recruitment efforts to community college student transfers. The impetus for these efforts is a desire to meet students' need for financial assistance coupled with the perception that community college transfers generally do well on transferring (Fischer 2007a; Suggs 2005; Blanton 2007). A recent study of Latino(a)s' pathway to graduate school reinforces that view\n\n(de los Santos and de los Santos 2005). (See sidebar \"Community Colleges and Latinos.\") Another factor in the ability of transfer students to obtain a bachelor's degree within 4\u00ad6 years of transfer is the number of transfer credits accepted by the 4-year colleges to which they transfer (Doyle 2006). Many states have adopted articulation policies (i.e., policies among institutions to accept the transfer credits) to encourage transfer of students from 2-year to 4-year colleges (NCES 2005a).\nCommunity college courses play a large role in mathematics preparation of undergraduates. In fall 2005, 1.7 million students were enrolled in mathematics and statistics courses at public 2-year colleges (an increase of 26% from fall 2000); this includes 42,000 high school students who took dual-enrollment math courses on a high school campus and received course credit at both the high school and the community college. Two-year colleges taught about 47% of all undergraduates enrolled in courses in the nation's mathematics departments and programs. Although enrollment in elementary statistics courses in 4-year colleges and universities grew by 9% from fall 2000 to fall 2005, community college enrollment in those courses grew by 58% (Kirkman et al. 2007).\nIn addition to their traditional roles, community colleges are beginning to offer a limited number of 4-year degrees (AASCU 2004), to examine closely their role in teacher preparation, and to develop some dual-credit programs with neighboring high schools. With the exception of those related to teacher preparation, the 4-year degrees offered at\nCommunity Colleges and Latinos\nLatinos share many risk factors associated with educational attainment with community college students in general. Community college students are more likely than 4-year college students to be from households with low incomes, to be from groups currently underrepresented in S&E fields, to be the first in their family to attend college, to have dependents to support, to be older than the average college student, to exhibit lower achievement in high school, and to delay attendance at college rather than go directly from high school to college (Bailey 2004).\nLatino students, as well as black and American Indian/Alaska Native students, are more likely than white or Asian students to attend community colleges. More than half (53%) of Latino undergraduates in 2004 were enrolled in community colleges compared with 41% of white students (NSF/SRS 2007a). At Arizona State University, which has a large Latino population, 67% of all students and 73% of the Latino bachelor's degree recipients in 2002\u00ad03 attended one or more of the local community colleges (Maricopa Community Colleges) before obtaining their degree (de los Santos and de los Santos 2005).\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 2-9\n\ncommunity colleges generally are in high-demand fields and are issued as bachelor of applied science degrees. (See, for example, the approximately 30 such programs offered in Florida's community college system [Fischer 2007b].)\nCommunity colleges provide the science and mathematics coursework for many elementary and secondary science and mathematics teachers. They increasingly offer coursework for K\u00ad8 teachers and provide programs in which preservice education students can complete their entire mathematics courses or licensure requirements. Thirty percent of community colleges reported that they offer mathematics programs for preservice elementary school teachers and 19% reported preservice middle school licensure-oriented programs. In fall 2000, teacher certification programs were almost entirely limited to 4-year colleges and universities; however, by fall 2005, several community colleges offered courses and programs that would lead directly to certification of primarily K\u00ad8 teachers (Kirkman et al. 2007).\nCommunity colleges also offer dual enrollment (high school and community college) courses in mathematics, including college algebra, precalculus, calculus, and statistics. Fifty percent of community colleges report having such courses. Most of them are taught on the high school campus by high school teachers, and usually the college and high school mathematics departments come to mutual agreement about factors such as syllabuses and textbooks (Kirkman et al. 2007).\nU.S. Higher Education Faculty\nS&E faculty constituted about half of the approximately 1.1 million instructional faculty in U.S. institutions in fall 2003. Most S&E faculty have doctoral or first professional degrees, and the number and percentage of S&E faculty with doctoral or first professional degrees is increasing. About 305,000 doctoral S&E faculty (about 60% of all S&E faculty) taught in U.S. universities in 2003, up from 249,000 in 1992 (appendix table 2-2). The largest fraction of doctoral S&E faculty (43%) taught agricultural, biological, or health sciences; another third (34%) taught physical sciences,2 mathematics, computer sciences, or engineering; and 23% taught social and behavioral sciences. This section deals with the teaching aspects of S&E faculty. Additional information about faculty employment can be found in chapter 3 (Science and Engineering Labor Force), and information about trends in academic employment of doctoral faculty and faculty research can be found in chapter 5 (Academic Research and Development).\nAbout 40% of S&E faculty have a master's or bachelor's degree as their highest degree. The number of S&E faculty with master's or bachelor's degrees who taught in U.S. colleges or universities rose from 174,000 in 1992 to 202,000 in 2003. Almost half are physical, mathematical, computer sciences, and engineering faculty (mainly computer sciences and mathematics faculty). In contrast to S&E faculty, about 60% of the approximately 586,000 non-S&E faculty in 2003 had master's or bachelor's degrees (appendix table 2-2).\n\nPart-time faculty are an increasing portion of all instructional faculty in the United States. The overall increase in part-time faculty from 1992 to 2003 was almost entirely accounted for by an increase in the percentage of nondoctoral faculty (from 60% in 1992 to 64% in 2003) (figure 2-1). Among doctoral faculty, there was no increase in the percentage of faculty employed part time between 1992 and 2003. Most doctoral S&E faculty (about 80%) are employed full time (appendix table 2-2). In contrast, the majority of faculty with bachelor's and master's degrees (both S&E and non-S&E) are employed part time.\nThe types of institutions in which doctoral and nondoctoral S&E faculty teach differ. Close to half (47%) of full-time doctoral S&E faculty (and more than half of full-time doctoral life sciences faculty) teach in research institutions (appendix table 2-3).3 In contrast, 11% of full-time nondoctoral S&E faculty teach in research institutions. Most nondoctoral S&E faculty and almost half of part-time S&E faculty teach in public 2-year institutions (table 2-1).\nMost (62%) full-time S&E faculty taught only undergraduates in 2003, while 25% taught only graduate students, and the remainder taught both undergraduate and graduate students (appendix table 2-4). In 2003, about two-thirds of physical sciences/mathematics/computer sciences/engineering and social/behavioral sciences faculty taught only undergraduate students. A far higher percentage of agricultural/biological/health sciences faculty (42%) than of other S&E faculty (13%) taught only graduate students. Full-time nondoctoral S&E faculty taught undergraduates almost exclusively. Among full-time doctoral S&E faculty, almost one-third taught only graduate students, slightly more than half (51%) taught only undergraduate students, and the remainder taught both undergraduate and graduate students. From 1992 to 2003, the percentage of doctoral faculty who taught only undergraduates declined and the percentage who taught only graduate or first professional students (e.g., law or medical students) increased, particularly among full-time doctoral agricultural/biological/health sciences faculty.\n\nFigure 2-1 Higher education faculty employed part time, by highest degree: Fall 1992 and fall 2003\n\nPercent\n\n100\n\n1992\n\n2003\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0 All\n\nDoctoral\n\nNondoctoral\n\nSOURCE: National Center for Education Statistics, National Survey of Postsecondary Faculty, 1993 and 2004, special tabulations (2006).\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\f2-10 \n\nChapter 2.

More than one-third of full-time undergraduate S&E faculty used TAs in 2003, up from 26% in 1992 (appendix table 2-5). The use of TAs is higher for doctoral faculty than for nondoctoral faculty, and is especially prevalent among doctoral faculty in the aggregate physical sciences/mathematics/computer sciences/engineering fields (54%). Only 16% of full-time nondoctoral S&E faculty and 18% of full-time non-S&E faculty use TAs in their undergraduate classes. Among all undergraduate faculty, primary instruction methods differ by discipline. (See sidebar \"Primary Instruction Methods of Undergraduate Faculty.\")\nTrends in Undergraduate Education\nThe recent Spellings Commission report called for higher education in the United States to improve access for all students, reform the financial aid system, provide better assessments of learning outcomes, improve the quality of instruction, meet changing employer needs, and improve accountability (U.S. Department of Education 2006). Several other recent reports (BEST 2004; COSEPUP 2006; NAE 2005; Project Kaleidoscope 2006) called for reforms to undergraduate S&E education, including increasing opportunities for students to engage in original research, developing a more global perspective, broadening the diversity of S&E majors, and encouraging interdisciplinary approaches. These reports also called for improvement in teaching through incorporation of new technologies and findings from education research and assessment, and broadening education to include non-sciencebased skills. In recent years, new approaches to undergraduate education have been developed in a wide variety of disciplines and types of institutions. (See sidebar \"Interdisciplinary Degree Programs\" for ways in which some of these changes are being manifested in new programs. See sidebar \"Nontechnical Skills Employers Expect of New Entrants to the Workforce\"\n\nPrimary Instruction Methods of Undergraduate Faculty\nMost (83%) instructional faculty use lecture/ discussion as the primary instructional method for undergraduate classes (Chen 2002). The types of assignments and methods used to grade students vary by discipline. More than half of faculty in the natural sciences* and engineering require their undergraduate students to participate in group projects (compared with 48% of social and behavioral sciences faculty) and more than 60% require lab assignments (compared with 24% of social and behavioral sciences faculty) (appendix table 2-6).\nSocial and behavioral sciences faculty are more likely than faculty in other S&E fields to require written work of their students: 85% of social and behavioral sciences faculty require term papers of their undergraduate students compared with 76% of agricultural/ biological/health sciences faculty and 57% of physical/ mathematical/computer sciences/engineering faculty. The use of term papers increased in all disciplines between 1992 and 2003.\n* Natural sciences include agricultural, biological, health, physical, earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences; mathematics; and computer sciences.\nfor information about what employers expect undergraduate education to provide.)\nA number of recent developments, including research (both general and discipline specific) on S&E undergraduate education, published outcomes from initiatives begun earlier to improve the delivery of S&E education (AAAS 2004; Boylan 2006; Clewell et al. 2006; Lattuca, Terenzini,\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 2-11\n\nInterdisciplinary Degree Programs\nIn response to the increasing interdependence of S&E disciplines, programs and courses within higher education increasingly reflect interdisciplinary approaches. In one notable interdisciplinary field, neuroscience, the number of doctorates awarded increased from 308 in 1995 to 689 in 2005 (NORC 2006). New interdisciplinary approaches are exemplified in the multidisciplinary doctorate program being adapted at the University of California at Santa Barbara, the Economics and Environmental Science PhD Training Program (www.ees.ucsb.edu/). Students earn a doctorate in either economics or in one of the natural sciences. Students in both fields are required to fulfill requirements in their own discipline as well as interdisciplinary courses. They design and conduct thesis research projects that span the two disciplines and include faculty from both departments as advisors.\nAt the undergraduate level, some interdisciplinary approaches include efforts to design courses and programs around an inherently interdisciplinary discipline (such as bioinformatics or nanotechnology) as a means of developing students' abilities with allied disciplines. Others involve developing programs whose implementation is enhanced by knowledge, habits of mind, and work approaches from many disciplines. As an example of the first, a broad spectrum of physics and biology faculty in New Mexico are developing a collaborative educational network. This network uses an interdisciplinary approach to produce materials about nanoscience appropriate for use in undergraduate courses in both biology and physics as a means of introducing nanoscience into two diverse disciplines. Biology faculty are developing a knowledge base in physics and physics faculty are developing a knowledge base in biology through joint attendance at workshops and development of course materials. As an example of the second, tissue engineering is being introduced to biology and engineering students in a joint biology/mechanical engineering course at the University of South Carolina\u00adColumbia. Senior-level students are designing bioreactors in their laboratory course and then using the experience to design experiments in courses at their own and other institutions.\nand Volkwein 2006; Lopatto 2004; NAE 2005), a growing body of literature of efforts to change undergraduate education, the emergence of the National Science Digital Library (http://nsdl.org/), increasing availability of assessment and evaluation tools, and new technologies available to undergraduate students, help to inform undergraduate education reform efforts.\nSeveral efforts to improve engineering education have been introduced by professional societies, the National\n\nNontechnical Skills Employers Expect of New Entrants to the Workforce\nEmployers believe that in order for the United States to compete in a global economy, the entering workforce should possess certain skills beyond expertise in their major field (AACU 2005; Bollag 2005; Conference Board 2006; NACE 2005; SCANS 1991). Some of the most important of these skills include good written and oral communication, critical thinking, the ability to work in teams, good interpersonal skills, and professionalism/work ethic.\nThe Conference Board (2006) recently found that too few college graduates excel in these areas. The majority of employers reported that 2- and 4-year college graduates were \"adequate\" in terms of general preparation for entry-level jobs. However, only 10% reported that 2-year graduates and 24% reported that 4-year graduates were \"excellent.\" In addition, more than one-fourth of employers reported that 4-year college graduates and almost half reported that 2-year college graduates were deficient in written communication. When asked about future skill needs, employers reported that the following basic knowledge and applied skills are expected to increase in importance: knowledge of foreign languages, making appropriate choices concerning health and wellness, and creativity/ innovation.\nBeyond attitudinal surveys, there is little current quantitative evidence of the effectiveness of postsecondary education, whether for specific knowledge and skills related to a field of study or for workplace readiness (Swyer, Millet, and Payne 2006; U.S. Department of Education 2006). However, efforts are under way to provide such evidence.\nAcademy of Engineering, and ABET (the accrediting body for postsecondary degree-granting programs in engineering) (Lattuca, Terenzini, and Volkwein 2006; NAE 2005). In 1996, ABET adopted a new set of standards for engineering programs called Engineering Criteria 2000 (EC2000). These new standards focused on assessing learning outcomes and broadening the set of skills required to include communication, working in teams, and ethics. Another project, Engineer of 2020, is an effort by the National Academy of Engineering to look at the future of engineering, including skills that may be needed in coming years. The project envisions that graduates in 2020 will need such traits as strong analytical skills, creativity, ingenuity, professionalism, and leadership (NAE 2005).\nIn mathematics, special interest groups focusing on educational issues at the undergraduate level have been formed at the Mathematical Association of America. In biology,\n\n\f2-12 \n\nChapter 2. Higher Education in Science and Engineering\n\nseveral new or upgraded education journals have been introduced in recent years, for example, CBE Life Sciences Education, Microbiology Education, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Education, and Education Forum section in Science. Across fields, science departments are beginning to build science education positions into their departmental structure, hiring people with a strong research degree within the discipline and interest and expertise in educational research (Bush et al. 2006; NAS 2006). These types of positions have a relatively long history in mathematics and physics but are only beginning to be widely introduced in disciplines such as biology, chemistry, or earth sciences.\nIn the federal government, the Academic Competitiveness Council recently focused attention on the effectiveness of federal agency programs in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education (U.S. Department of Education 2007). Nine federal agencies administer 43 programs aimed at improving STEM undergraduate education, including increasing numbers and retention in STEM fields, increasing diversity, and improving content and pedagogy. The council advocated more rigorous evaluation of these programs, particularly of long-term student outcomes.\nFinancing Higher Education\nRising costs of higher education and increases in student debt over the past two decades raised questions about affordability and access in U.S. higher education institutions (NSB 2003). Public institutions account for about 40% of all degree-granting higher education institutions in the United States and enroll almost 80% of all undergraduates. In the past, these institutions were funded primarily through state\n\nexpenditures. In recent years, the percentage of funding coming from state expenditures has declined, state per-student spending has declined, and tuition has increased. This section examines trends in tuition levels (including net price to students by family income), need-based and merit-based financial aid, financial support for undergraduate and graduate education, and student debt.\nTuition Tuition and fee increases at colleges and universities in\nthe United States have grown rapidly for the past two decades, rising well above increases in disposable income. However, student aid increased even faster than tuition (figure 2-2). Tuition and fee increases reached double-digit rates in 2003\u00ad04, although the rate of increase slowed in the past few years (table 2-2). In the 2006\u00ad07 academic year, average tuition and fees, compared with the previous year, rose 6.3% for in-state students at public 4-year colleges, 5.9% for students in private 4-year colleges, and 4.1% for students at public 2-year colleges (College Board 2006a).\nAs state spending rose from FY 2005 to FY 2007, the rate of increase of tuition and fees at public 4-year colleges slowed. Fluctuations in state spending, however, do not completely explain variations in tuition and fees. Other contributors to tuition and fee increases include rising prices of goods and services purchased by colleges and universities as measured by the Higher Education Price Index, which have risen faster in recent years than the Consumer Price Index (CPI). From academic years 2000\u00ad01 to 2005\u00ad06, the prices paid by colleges and universities for utilities, salaries, fringe benefits, and supplies and materials rose faster than the CPI (College Board 2006a).\n\nFigure 2-2 Average annual tuition, fees, room, and board for public 4-year institutions, total student aid dollars, and disposable personal income: 1997\u00ad2006\n\nTuition and personal income ($billions)\n\nStudent aid ($millions)\n\n14,000\n\n160,000\n\n12,000 10,000\n8,000 6,000 4,000 2,000\n\nAverage annual tuition, fees, room, and board\n\nTotal student aid dollars Disposable personal income\n\n140,000 120,000 100,000 80,000 60,000 40,000 20,000\n\n0 1997\n\n1998\n\n1999\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n0 2006\n\nSOURCES: College Board, Trends in College Pricing 2006; and Bureau of Economic Analysis, National Income and Product Accounts Table 2.1, http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N, accessed 13 April 2007.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 2-13\n\nTable 2-2 Average annual published tuition and fee charges: 1996\u00ad97 to 2006\u00ad07\n\nPrivate 4-year\n\nPublic 4-year\n\nPublic 2-year\n\nPrivate 4-year Public 4-year\n\nPublic 2-year\n\nAcademic year\n\nCharges (current\nUS$)\n\nAnnual change\n(%)\n\nCharges (current\nUS$)\n\nAnnual change\n(%)\n\nCharges (current\nUS$)\n\nAnnual change\n(%)\n\nCharges\n\nCharges\n\nCharges\n\n(2006 Annual (2006 Annual (2006\n\nconstant change constant change constant\n\nUS$) (%) US$) (%) US$)\n\nAnnual change\n(%)\n\n1996\u00ad97................ 12,994 na 1997\u00ad98................ 13,785 6.1 1998\u00ad99................ 14,709 6.7 1999\u00ad2000............ 15,518 5.5 2000\u00ad01................ 16,072 3.6 2001\u00ad02................ 17,377 8.1 2002\u00ad03................ 18,060 3.9 2003\u00ad04................ 18,950 4.9 2004\u00ad05................ 20,045 5.8 2005\u00ad06................ 20,980 4.7 2006\u00ad07................ 22,218 5.9\n\n2,975\n\nna 1,465\n\nna 16,843 na 3,856\n\nna\n\n3,111 4.6 1,567\n\n7.0 17,480 3.8 3,945 2.3\n\n3,247 4.4 1,554 -0.8 18,355 5.0 4,052 2.7\n\n3,362 3.5 1,649\n\n6.1 18,935 3.2 4,102 1.2\n\n3,508 4.3 1,642 -0.4 18,965 0.2 4,139 0.9\n\n3,766 7.4 1,608 -2.1 19,962 5.3 4,326 4.5\n\n4,098 8.8 1,674\n\n4.1 20,379 2.1 4,624 6.9\n\n4,645 13.3 1,909 14.0 20,931 2.7 5,131 11.0\n\n5,126 10.4 2,079\n\n8.9 21,568 3.0 5,516 7.5\n\n5,492 7.1 2,182\n\n5.0 21,781 1.0 5,702 3.4\n\n5,836 6.3 2,272\n\n4.1 22,218 2.0 5,836 2.4\n\n1,899\n\nna\n\n1,987\n\n4.6\n\n1,939 -2.4\n\n2,012\n\n3.8\n\n1,938 -3.7\n\n1,847 -4.7\n\n1,889\n\n2.3\n\n2,109 11.6\n\n2,237\n\n6.1\n\n2,265\n\n1.3\n\n2,272\n\n0.3\n\nna = not applicable\n\nNOTE: Enrollment data weighted.\n\nSOURCE: College Board, Trends in College Pricing 2006.\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nStudents typically do not pay the full tuition and fee charges, which averaged $5,836 for in-state students at public 4-year colleges, $22,218 for students at private 4-year colleges, and $2,272 for students at public 2-year colleges during the 2006\u00ad07 academic year (table 2-2). The net price of an undergraduate college education is defined as the published price minus the average grant aid and tax benefits that students receive. Student aid (grant aid and tax benefits) averaged $3,100 at public 4-year institutions, $9,000 at private 4-year institutions, and $2,200 at public 2-year institutions in 2006\u00ad07.\nIn 2006\u00ad07, the net price was about $2,700 at public 4-year institutions, $13,200 at private 4-year institutions, and under $100 at public 2-year colleges (College Board 2006a).4 The net price at public 4-year institutions (in inflation-adjusted dollars) fell between 1997\u00ad98 and 2002\u00ad03 but rose through 2006\u00ad07, while the net price at private 4-year institutions rose between 1997\u00ad98 and 2006\u00ad07. The net price of college for low-income students did not increase over the past decade. For middle-income students, the net price of college also remained stable after accounting for grants and loans (with the bulk of aid in the form of loans). Thus, middle-income students subsequently had higher levels of debt from educational loans. From 1993 to 2004, the percentage of degree recipients who borrowed and their median amount of debt both increased (American Council on Education 2005).\nGraduate tuition varies more than undergraduate tuition. Graduate tuition is typically per credit, which varies by academic institution and often varies within an institution depending on the school, department, or degree program, and sometimes the stage of the program (e.g., first-year, disserta-\n\ntion). Furthermore, the number of credits required for graduation and thus the total tuition varies by the length of the program (e.g., 1-year master's, 2-year master's, doctoral). On average, the cost of attendance was $24,000 for fulltime graduate students in public institutions and $35,800 for those in private institutions for the 2003\u00ad04 academic year (Redd 2006).\nThe number of students who pay tuition also varies by enrollment status, institution, discipline, and type of funding. In some disciplines, most full-time students receive financial assistance in the form of fellowships, teaching assistantships, or research assistantships, and many may receive tuition waivers. However, school-to-school differences exist even within disciplines, and master's level students are generally treated differently from doctoral candidates. In other disciplines, students are largely self-supported and do not receive tuition waivers. (See sidebar, \"Cost of Higher Education Internationally.\")\nUndergraduate and Graduate Student Financial Support Patterns\nFinancial Support for Undergraduate Education. As tuition increased in the 1990s, students increasingly relied on financial aid (especially loans) to finance their education. Financial aid for undergraduate students is mainly in the form of grants, student loans (federal or private), and work study. A financial aid package may contain one or more of these kinds of support. In the 2003\u00ad04 academic year, about one-third of all undergraduate students received no financial aid, about half received grants, and about one-third took out loans (NCES 2005a). A higher percentage of undergraduates in private, nonprofit 4-year institutions (83%) than of those in public 4-year\n\n\f2-14 \n\nChapter 2. Higher Education in Science and Engineering\n\nCost of Higher Education Internationally\n\nUnlike the United States, many countries historically did not charge tuition for higher education. In the past decade, however, most instituted some form of cost sharing, either tuition or fees (Preston 2006). Imposition of tuition and fees has been a response to a growing need for additional revenue, growth in enrollment, and competing demands on public funding. For example, tuition was first instituted in China in 1997, in Great Britain in 1998, in Austria in 2001, and in some German states in 2006 (Johnstone 2003; Kehm 2006). In the Scandinavian countries, tuition remains free but students are charged for room and board. In some countries in East Asia and Latin America, public institutions remain free but because enrollment is limited, expansion of higher education has been primarily through private institutions that charge tuition and fees. In most countries where tuition is charged, students are offered some form of low-cost loans for higher education (Johnstone 2003).\nThe initiation of tuition and fees and increases in tuition in some countries have raised concerns about affordability. For example, in China in 2000, the government set annual\n\ntuition at about 5,000 yuan (about U.S. $600), which is considered high given the average urban per capita income of 10,493 yuan (U.S. $1,313) and the average farmer's income of 3,256 yuan (U.S. $407) (OBHE 2003; Shinan 2006). In Canada, average undergraduate tuition increased at an average of 7% annually since 1990\u00ad91, almost 4 times the average rate of inflation (Statistics Canada 2006). Canadian public colleges are seen by some as less affordable than those in the United States because even though tuition is lower, U.S. public colleges provide far more money in the form of grants than do Canadian colleges (Birchard 2006; Usher and Steele 2006). Direct comparisons of affordability across countries are difficult because tuition, financial assistance, and policies for providing public subsidies vary widely among countries and even within some countries depending on citizenship (OECD 2006). Table 2-3 shows average amounts of tuition by country. Countries with higher tuition fees do not necessarily provide greater amounts of financial support to students, and countries with low tuition may have substantial proportions of students receiving scholarships and grants (OECD 2006).\n\nTable 2-3 Estimated average annual tuition fees of tertiary-type A educational institutions for full-time students, by type of institution: Academic year 2004\n(U.S. dollars)\n\nCountry\n\nPublic institutions\n\nPrivate institutions\n\nCountry\n\nPublic institutions\n\nPrivate institutions\n\nOECD countries Australia ...................

The percentage of full-time undergraduates who had federal loans increased from 31% in 1992\u00ad93 to 48% in 2003\u00ad04 (NCES 2006), and the average amount of loans increased. In recent years, students have increasingly relied on private loans, which typically have much higher interest rates. At the same time, the percentage of students who are supported by grants alone or in combination with other mechanisms decreased (College Board 2006b) (figure 2-3).\nFinancial aid packages are often awarded on the basis of either need or academic merit, although some forms of aid combine both criteria. Need-based financial aid, which was the norm through the 1980s, aims to increase access for students who otherwise could not afford to attend college. In recent years, an increasing number of financial aid programs and increasing dollar amounts focused on academic merit in an effort to attract top students. Merit-based aid (i.e., aid for which recipients are selected on the basis of test scores, performance, class rank, grade point average, or other achievement) makes up an increasing percentage of state grants, rising from 9% in 1984\u00ad85 to 27% in 2004\u00ad05. The number of federal Pell Grant (which are based on financial need) recipients increased over time, but the average amount of aid per recipient decreased in recent years in both current and inflation-adjusted dollars (College Board 2006b).\nFinancial Support for S&E Graduate Education. About one-third of S&E graduate students are self-supporting; that is, they rely primarily on loans, their own funds, or family funds for financial support. The other two-thirds receive primary financial support from a wide variety of sources: the federal\n\nFigure 2-3 Grants and loans as percentage of undergraduate student aid: 1991\u00ad92 to 2005\u00ad06\nPercent\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\nLoans\n\nGrants 40\n\n20\n\nOther 0 1995\u00ad96 1997\u00ad98 1999\u00ad2000 2001\u00ad02\n\n2003\u00ad04\n\n2005\u00ad06\n\nNOTES: Estimated 2004\u00ad05 data; preliminary 2005\u00ad06 data.

Sources of funding include federal agency support, nonfederal support, and self-support. Nonfederal support includes state funds, particularly in the large public university systems; these funds are affected by the condition of overall state budgets. Most graduate students, especially those who pursue doctoral degrees, are supported by more than one source or mechanism during their time in graduate school and some receive support from several different sources and mechanisms in any given academic year.\nOther than self-support, RAs are the most prevalent primary mechanism of financial support for S&E graduate students. The percentage of full-time S&E graduate students supported primarily by RAs increased in the late 1980s, rising from 24% in 1985 to roughly 27%\u00ad29% from 1988 through 2005. Although the number of full-time S&E graduate students relying primarily on fellowships and TAs rose over the past two decades, an increase in overall graduate enrollment meant that the percentage of students supported by these mechanisms stayed flat or declined. In 2005, 18% of full-time S&E graduate students were primarily supported through TAs and 13% were primarily supported through either traineeships or fellowships (appendix table 2-7).\nPrimary mechanisms of support differ widely by S&E field of study (appendix table 2-8). For example, in 2005, full-time students in physical sciences were financially supported mainly through RAs (43%) and TAs (39%) (figure 2-4). RAs also were important in agricultural sciences (57%); biological sciences (43%); earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences (42%); and engineering (41%). In mathematics, however, primary student support is through TAs (54%) and self-support (19%). Full-time students in the social and behavioral sciences are mainly self-supporting (47%) or receive TAs (19%), and students in medical/other life sciences are mainly self-supporting (60%).\nThe federal government served as the primary source of financial support for about 21% of full-time S&E graduate students in 2005 (appendix table 2-9). The federal government plays a substantial role in supporting S&E graduate students in some mechanisms and fields, and a smaller role in others. For example, in 2005, the federal government funded 67% of S&E graduate students on traineeships, 51% of those with RAs, and 23% of those with fellowships. Federal financial support for graduate education reaches relatively more students in the physical sciences; earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences; agricultural sciences; biological sciences; and engineering. Relatively fewer students in mathematics, computer sciences, social sciences, psychology, and medical/other life sciences receive federal support (figure 2-5).

See appendix table 2-8.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nMost federal financial support for graduate education is in the form of research assistantships funded through grants to universities for academic research. Research assistantships are the primary mechanism of support for 69% of federally supported full-time S&E graduate students, up from 62% two decades earlier. Fellowships and traineeships are the means of funding 22% of the federally funded full-time S&E graduate students, and federally funded fellowships and traineeships fund 4% of all full-time S&E graduate students. The share of federally supported S&E graduate students receiving traineeships declined from 18% in 1985 to 12% in 2005. For students supported through nonfederal sources in 2005, TAs were the most prominent mechanism (40%), followed by RAs (31%) (appendix table 2-7).\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) support most of the full-time S&E graduate students whose primary support comes from the federal government. In 2005, they supported about 26,800 and 20,400 students, respectively. Trends in federal agency support of graduate students show considerable increases from 1985 to 2005 in the proportion of students funded (NIH, from 23% to 32%; NSF, from 21% to 24%).

In 2005, male U.S. citizens were more likely to have been supported by RAs (25%) and female U.S. citizens were more likely to have supported themselves from personal sources of funds (23%). Among U.S. citizens, whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders were more likely than other racial/ethnic groups to have had primary support from RAs (22% and 25%, respectively), and underrepresented minorities depended more on fellowships (34%). The primary source of support for doctoral degree students with temporary visas was an RA (49%) (appendix table 2-11).\nU.S. citizen white and Asian/Pacific Islander men, as well as foreign doctoral degree students, are more likely than U.S. citizen white and Asian/Pacific Islander women and underrepresented minority doctoral degree students of both sexes to receive doctorates in engineering and physical sciences, fields largely supported by RAs. Women and underrepresented minorities are more likely than other groups to receive doctorates in social sciences and psychology, fields in which self-support is prevalent. Differences in type of support by sex, race/ethnicity, or citizenship remain, however,\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 2-17\n\nFigure 2-6 Primary mechanisms of support for S&E doctorate recipients, by citizenship, sex, and race/ethnicity: 2005\n\nResearch assistantships\n\nFellowships\n\nTeaching assistantships\n\nPersonal\n\nGrant/stipend\n\nOther\n\nMale, U.S. citizen Female, U.S. citizen\nWhite, U.S. citizen\n\nAsian, U.S. citizen Underrepresented minority, U.S. citizen\nTemporary resident\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nPercent\n\nNOTES: Personal sources include personal savings, other personal earnings in graduate school, other family earnings or savings, and loans.

These differences in type of support have potential consequences for levels of debt and long-term career success (Nettles and Millett 2006).\nUndergraduate and Graduate Debt\nUndergraduate debt. Undergraduate major has relatively little effect on undergraduate debt (NSF/SRS 2006a); however, levels of debt vary by type of institution and state. Levels of undergraduate debt for students from public colleges and universities are almost as high as those for students from private colleges and universities. The median level of debt for 2003\u00ad04 bachelor's degree recipients who took out loans was $19,300 overall; $19,500 for those who graduated from private nonprofit institutions and $15,500 for those who graduated from public colleges and universities (College Board 2006b).\nLevels of debt vary widely by state. Average debt for 2005 graduates of public 4-year colleges and universities ranged from $23,198 in Iowa to $11,067 in Utah (Burd 2006; Project on Student Debt 2006). Average debt for graduates of private nonprofit colleges and universities ranges from\n\n$32,504 in Arizona to $13,309 in Utah. Levels of debt are not necessarily higher in states where the cost of living is high, and are not necessarily higher in schools in which tuition is high. Some low-tuition schools with large numbers of lowincome students report high levels of average student debt. See \"Higher Education\" in chapter 8 (State Indicators) for additional state indicators dealing with higher education.\nDebt Levels of S&E Doctorate Recipients. At the time of doctoral degree conferral, about half of S&E doctorate recipients have debt related to either their undergraduate or graduate education. About a fourth have some undergraduate debt and about a third owe money directly related to graduate education. In 2005, 27% of S&E doctorate recipients reported having undergraduate debt and 33% reported having graduate debt. For some, debt levels were high, especially for graduate debt: 1% reported more than $50,000 of undergraduate debt and 10% reported more than $50,000 of graduate debt (appendix table 2-12).\nLevels of debt vary widely by doctorate fields. High levels of graduate debt were most common among doctorate recipients in psychology, social sciences, and medical/other health sciences. Psychology doctorate recipients were most likely to report having graduate debt and also high levels of debt.5 In 2005, 26% of psychology doctoral degree recipients compared with 10% of all S&E doctoral degree recipients reported graduate debt of more than $50,000. Doctorate recipients in engineering; biological sciences; computer sciences; earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences; mathematics; and physical sciences were least likely to report graduate debt. Although men and women differed little in level of debt, blacks and Hispanics had higher levels of graduate debt than whites, even accounting for differences in field of doctorate (NORC 2006).\nDebt levels in non-S&E graduate/professional fields. Average student loan debt was higher for students graduating with law degrees, medical degrees, and other health degrees than it was for those with doctoral degrees in 2003\u00ad04. Law graduates from public institutions averaged $51,200, medical doctors averaged $78,400, and other health graduates averaged $66,000 in cumulative student loan debt, compared with $39,000 for doctoral degree recipients. Debt for those with degrees from private institutions was even higher (Redd 2006).\nDebt burden. Graduates with relatively high post-college earnings may find it easier to pay off education-related debt than those with lower earnings, given similar amounts of debt and similar interest rates. Because starting salaries in the humanities and social sciences are relatively low and debt is relatively high, debt burden (loan payments as a percent of salary) of master's and doctoral graduates in the humanities and social sciences is higher than in other fields (although debt burden of law students is also high). Debt burden is lower in the natural sciences, life sciences, and engineering (Redd 2006).\n\n\f2-18 \n\nChapter 2. Higher Education in Science and Engineering\n\nHigher Education Enrollment in the United States\nRecent higher education enrollments reflect the expanding U.S. college-age population. This section examines trends in undergraduate and graduate enrollment by type of institution, field, and demographic characteristics. For information on enrollment rates of high school seniors, see \"Transition to Higher Education\" in chapter 1.\nOverall Enrollment\nOver the past two decades, enrollment in U.S. institutions of higher education rose fairly steadily from 12.7 million students in 1986 to 16.9 million in 2004 (appendix table 2-13), despite declines in the college-age population in the mid-1990s. More than 6 million students (about 38% of all students enrolled in higher education institutions in the United States) were enrolled in 2-year institutions in 2004. Research universities (doctorate-granting universities with very high research activity) and master's-granting universities together accounted for another 37% of all students enrolled (6.2 million) (appendix table 2-13). (See sidebar \"Carnegie Classification of Academic Institutions\" for definitions of the types of academic institutions.)\nEnrollment in higher education is projected to increase in coming years because of increases in the college-age population (NCES 2005b). These projections are based primarily on population projections but also incorporate information about household income (a measure of ability to pay) and age-specific unemployment rates (a measure of opportunity costs).6 According to Census Bureau projections, the number of college-age (ages 20\u00ad24) individuals is expected to grow from 20.8 million in 2005 to 26.3 million by 2050 (appendix table 2-14). Increased enrollment in higher education is projected to come mainly from minority groups, particularly Asians and Hispanics. From 2000 to 2050, the Asian and Hispanic college-age populations are projected to more than double, while the black and white non-Hispanic college-age populations are projected to rise by 48% and 0.5%, respectively (appendix table 2-14).\nUndergraduate Enrollment in S&E\nFreshmen Intentions to Major in S&E Since 1972, the annual Survey of the American Fresh-\nman, National Norms, which is administered by the Higher Education Research Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles, asked freshmen at a large number of universities and colleges about their intended majors. The data provided a broadly accurate picture of degree fields several years later.7 For at least the past two decades, about one-third of all freshmen planned to study S&E. In 2006, about onethird of white, black, Hispanic, and American Indian freshmen and 45% of Asian freshmen reported that they intended to major in S&E (figure 2-7). The proportions planning to major in S&E were higher for men in every racial/ethnic group\n\nFigure 2-7 Freshmen intending S&E major, by race/ethnicity: Selected years, 1985\u00ad2006\n\nPercent\n\n100 Asian American\n\nOther Latino\n\nBlack\n\n80\n\nMexican American/Chicano/Puerto Rican\n\nAmerican Indian/Alaska Native\n\nWhite 60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 2000 2002 2004 2006\nSOURCE: Higher Education Research Institute, University of California at Los Angeles, Survey of the American Freshman: National Norms, special tabulations (2007).\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n(appendix table 2-15). For most racial/ethnic groups, about 10%\u00ad16% planned to major in social/behavioral sciences, about 6%\u00ad8% in engineering, about 8%\u00ad10% in biological/ agricultural sciences, 1%\u00ad2% in computer sciences, 2%\u00ad3% in physical sciences,8 and 1% in mathematics or statistics. Higher proportions of Asian freshmen than of those from other racial/ethnic groups planned to major in biological/ agricultural sciences (17%) and engineering (12%). The percentages of all freshmen intending to major in engineering or computer sciences dropped in recent years, while the percentage intending to major in biological/agricultural sciences increased.\nThe demographic composition of students planning S&E majors has become more diverse over time. Women constituted 39% of freshmen planning S&E majors in 1985, but this proportion rose to 47% in 2006. White students declined from 84% in 1985 to 72% in 2006. On the other hand, the proportion of Asian students increased from 4% to 12%, Hispanic students from 2% to 9%, and American Indian students from 1% to 2% (appendix table 2-16). Black students increased from 10% to 11% of freshmen intending to major in S&E.\nForeign Undergraduate Enrollment The total number of foreign students (undergraduate, grad-\nuate, and other) enrolled in U.S. academic institutions held steady in 2005\u00ad06 after 2 consecutive years of decline. The number of foreign students in S&E fields dropped in 2005\u00ad06 for the second year in a row (figure 2-8). Enrollment of new foreign students increased 5%, suggesting that total foreign enrollment is likely to increase in coming years. The number of foreign undergraduates decreased 1%, the fourth con-\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 2-19\n\nFigure 2-8 Foreign students, by field of study: 1996\u00ad97 to 2005\u00ad06\nThousands\n700\n\n600\n\nAll fields\n\n500\n\nAll S&E\n\nNatural sciences\n\n400\n\nEngineering\n\nSocial sciences 300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0 1996\u00ad97\n\n1999\u00ad2000 2001\u00ad02 2003\u00ad04 2005\u00ad06\n\nNOTES: Foreign students include both undergraduate and graduate students.

Decreases in foreign enrollments from 2001 through 2005 have been attributed to increased opportunity for higher education in the home country, competition from other countries for foreign students, rising U.S. tuition, and difficulties in obtaining U.S. visas (IIE 2005). Recently, adjustments to visa requirements made it easier for students to obtain visas, and their number increased. Declines in particular fields may also be due to declining job opportunities in those fields. Among all foreign students (undergraduate and graduate), the number of those studying the physical sciences dropped 4%, mathematics 5%, engineering 5%, and computer sciences 12% in 2005\u00ad06 compared with the preceding year. Other S&E fields experienced increases in foreign students; for example, agricultural sciences and biological and biomedical sciences each increased 5% and psychology increased 3% (IIE 2006).\nSouth Korea (31,500), Japan (24,500), Canada (12,400), China (10,900), and India (10,600) accounted for the largest numbers of foreign undergraduates in the United States in April 2007 and were among the top countries sending foreign undergraduates in S&E fields (figure 2-9; appendix table 2-17). Saudi Arabia and Nepal, which accounted for fewer total undergraduates in the United States, were also among the top countries sending foreign undergraduates in S&E fields.\nEnrollment by Field For the most part, undergraduate enrollment data are\nnot available by field; however, annual data on engineering enrollment are available from the Engineering Workforce Commission, and the Conference Board of Mathematical Sciences compiles data on enrollment in mathematics and statistics every 5 years.\n\nFigure 2-9 Foreign undergraduate student enrollment in U.S. universities, by field (S&E and all fields) for top 10 places of origin: April 2007\n\nSouth Korea Japan\nCanada\n\nS&E All fields\n\nChina\n\nIndia\n\nTaiwan\n\nNepal\n\nHong Kong\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nNigeria\n\n0\n\n5 10 15 20 25 30 35\n\nThousands\n\nSOURCE: Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, Student and Exchange Visitor Information System database, special tabulations (2007).

Undergraduate engineering enrollment declined through most of the 1980s and 1990s, rose from 2000 through 2003, and declined slightly in recent years. Undergraduate engineering enrollment declined from 420,900 students in 1985 to about 361,400 students by 1999 before rebounding to about 422,000 in 2003. By 2005, it declined to 409,300 (figure 2-10; appendix table 2-18). The declines in undergraduate engineering enrollment in recent years were evident for both men and women and for most racial/ethnic groups (NSF/SRS 2007a). Graduate engineering enrollment rose since the late 1990s, reaching a new peak of 147,900 in 2003, then declined to 139,800 in 2005 (figure 2-10; appendix table 2-19).\nMathematics and Statistics. Undergraduate enrollment in mathematics and statistics departments declined slightly between fall 2000 and fall 2005 in 4-year colleges and universities, and increased 26% in public 2-year colleges. More than half of student enrollment in mathematics courses in 2-year colleges is in precollege (or remedial) mathematics (Kirkman et al. 2007). The number of students taking precollege level courses (remedial courses) in mathematics at 4-year colleges and universities dropped from 261,000 in fall 1990 to 201,000 in fall 2005.

See appendix table 2-19.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\nthe number of students taking precollege level mathematics courses at 2-year colleges increased from 724,000 to 965,000 (table 2-4). The decline at 4-year institutions may reflect the policies of some states to move state-supported remedial education to 2-year institutions. Efforts are currently under way in at least 26 states to improve communication between high schools and colleges and to better align high school graduation standards to skills required for college entry (Cohen et al. 2006).\nGraduate Enrollment in S&E Graduate S&E educational institutions are a major source\nof both the high-skilled workers of the future and of the research needed for a knowledge-based economy. This section presents data on trends in graduate S&E enrollment, including trends in first-time enrollment of foreign students after September 11, 2001.\n\nEnrollment by Field S&E graduate enrollment in the United States reached a\nnew peak of 583,200 in fall 2005. Following a long period of growth that began in the 1970s, graduate enrollment in S&E declined in the latter half of the 1990s but increased steadily since 1999 (appendix table 2-20). Growth occurred through 2005 in most major S&E fields, with two notable exceptions. In computer sciences, enrollment increased through 2002, and in engineering, through 2003. Enrollment in both areas then declined through 2005, with the decline attributable to foreign student enrollment. The number of full-time students enrolled for the first time in S&E graduate departments offers a good indicator of developing trends. The number of first-time full-time S&E graduate students also reached a new peak (110,400) in 2005. It declined in the mid-1990s in all major S&E fields but increased in most science fields through 2005 (appendix table 2-21). Growth was greatest in biological sciences, medical/other life sciences, and social and behavioral sciences. First-time full-time graduate enrollment declined in recent years in engineering; computer sciences; mathematics; earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences; and agricultural sciences.\nFirst-time full-time graduate enrollment, particularly in engineering and computer sciences, often follows trends in employment opportunities. When employment opportunities are plentiful, recent graduates often forego graduate school, but when employment opportunities are scarce, further training in graduate school may be perceived as a better option. Figure 2-11 shows trends in unemployment rates and firsttime full-time graduate enrollment in engineering and computer sciences. Enrollment in S&E fields that offer fewer employment opportunities at the bachelor's level (e.g., biological sciences) does not follow this trend.\nEnrollment by Sex and Race/Ethnicity The recent increase in S&E graduate enrollment overall\noccurred across all major U.S. citizen and permanent resident demographic groups: women, minorities, and white men.

In contrast, the number of male S&E graduate students declined from 1993 through the end of that decade before increasing in recent years (appendix table 2-20).\nThe long-term trend of women's rising proportions in S&E fields also continued. Women made up 36% of S&E graduate students in 1985 and 49% in 2005, although large variations among fields persist. In 2005, women constituted the majority of graduate enrollment in psychology (76%), medical/other life sciences (78%), biological sciences (56%), and social sciences (54%). They constituted considerable proportions of graduate students in mathematics (37%), chemistry (40%), and earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences (46%). However, their percentage in computer sciences (25%) remains unchanged since 1985 and their percentages in engineering (22%) and physics (20%) remain low (appendix table 2-20).\nThe proportion of underrepresented minority (black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native) students in graduate S&E programs increased from about 6% in 1985 to about 11% in 2005.9 Increases occurred in all major science fields and in engineering during that period (appendix table 2-22). In 2005, blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians/Alaska Natives as a group made up 6%\u00ad7% of graduate enrollment in many S&E fields (engineering; mathematics; physical sciences; earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences; and computer sciences), 8%\u00ad9% of graduate enrollment in agricultural and biological sciences, 14% in medical/other life sciences, 17% in social sciences, and 19% in psychology.\n\nThe number of white S&E graduate students decreased from 1994 to 2001 in most S&E fields and then increased through 2005, while the numbers of black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native students increased steadily from 1985 through 2005 (figure 2-12). The long-term rise in the numbers of black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native graduate students occurred in most S&E fields with the exceptions of engineering and mathematics. In those two fields, enrollment reached a plateau in the 1990s before rising again from 2000 through 2005. In computer sciences, enrollment of blacks and American Indians/Alaska Natives peaked in the early 2000s as it did for all other racial/ethnic groups, then declined (although Hispanic enrollment in computer sciences continued to rise). The number of Asian/ Pacific Islander S&E graduate students increased every year since 1985 with the exception of 2000 and 2004. As was the case for all racial/ethnic groups, Asian enrollment in graduate engineering programs dropped in the mid-1990s, increased through 2003, then declined again. Asians/Pacific Islanders accounted for about 7% of S&E graduate enrollment in 2005 (appendix table 2-22).\nForeign Student Enrollment Foreign graduate student enrollment in S&E grew from\n79,900 in 1985 to 154,900 in 2003 before declining through 2005. Despite the decline, the number of foreign S&E graduate students in 2005 (146,700) was higher than in 2001. Foreign students increased from 20% to 25% of all S&E graduate students from 1985 to 2005 (appendix table 2-22). The concentration of foreign enrollment was highest in engineering (45%), computer sciences (43%), physical sciences (40%), and mathematics (37%).\n\nFigure 2-12 S&E graduate enrollment, by citizenship and race/ ethnicity: Selected years, 1985\u00ad2005\nThousands\n350\n\n300\n\n250\n\nWhite\n\nTemporary resident\n\n200\n\nAsian/Pacific Islander Black\n\nHispanic\n\n150\n\nOther/unknown race/ethnicity\n\nAmerican Indian/Alaska Native\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering, Integrated Science and Engineering Resources Data System (WebCASPAR), http://webcaspar.nsf.gov.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\f2-22 \n\nChapter 2. Higher Education in Science and Engineering\n\nFirst-time full-time enrollment of foreign S&E graduate students increased 4% in fall 2005, the first increase since September 11, 2001, although numbers remain below those of 2001 (appendix table 2-23). The number of first-time fulltime foreign students declined 18% from 2001 through 2004. Declines were concentrated mainly in engineering (down 26%) and computer sciences (down 36%); these fields are heavily favored by foreign students. First-time full-time foreign enrollment increased 5% in biological sciences and 1% in medical/other life sciences from 2001 through 2004. Foreign students' share of first-time full-time S&E graduate enrollment dropped from 35% in fall 2000 to 27% in fall 2005, with most of the decrease in computer sciences (from 71% to 56%) and engineering (61% to 51%) (appendix table 2-23).\nAccording to data collected by the Institute of International Education, the overall number of foreign graduate students in all fields decreased 2% from academic year 2004\u00ad05 to 2005\u00ad06, with all of the decrease occurring among master's degree students. The proportion of foreign master's degree students decreased 5% and that of foreign doctoral students increased 6%. India, China, South Korea, Taiwan, and Canada are the top places of origin for foreign graduate students. More than half of all foreign graduate students are studying S&E. More recent data from the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services show an increase in foreign graduate students from April 2006 to April 2007, with foreign enrollment in S&E fields growing 8% (appendix table 2-24). Most of the growth was in computer sciences (up 14%) and engineering (up 10%). In April 2007, India accounted for 66,500 foreign graduate students with 70% in S&E fields. China accounted for 48,300 foreign graduate students with 67% in S&E. In contrast, less than half of graduate students from South Korea, Taiwan, and Canada were studying S&E fields. Business accounts for large numbers of graduate students from South Korea and Taiwan, and education accounts for large numbers of graduate students from Canada.\n\nPersistence, Retention, and Attainment in Higher Education\nand in S&E\nMany students who start out in undergraduate or graduate programs drop out before completing a degree. This section examines differences between S&E and non-S&E students in persistence and completion of higher education.\nUndergraduate Retention\nS&E students persist and complete undergraduate programs at about the same rate as non-S&E students. Six years after enrollment in a 4-year college or university in 1995\u00ad96, about 60% of both S&E and non-S&E students had completed a bachelor's degree. Another 13%\u00ad17% were still enrolled and may eventually have earned a bachelor's degree, and about 20% had not completed any degree and were no longer enrolled (table 2-5).\nUndergraduate field switching out of S&E is about equally matched by entry into S&E fields as a whole. Among postsecondary students who began at 4-year colleges or universities in 1995\u00ad96, 26% reported an S&E major, 44% reported a non-S&E major, and 31% were missing data on major or had not declared a major. Of those for whom data on major are available and reported, 37% reported an S&E major. Six years later, among those who had attained a bachelor's degree, 39% were S&E majors. Although about 30% of agricultural/biological sciences majors, 20% of engineering/computer sciences/mathematics/physical sciences majors, and 30% of social sciences majors eventually switched to non-S&E majors before earning a bachelor's degree, 43% of those with initially missing or undeclared majors and 14% of those with initial non-S&E majors switched into S&E fields before earning their bachelor's degrees (table 2-6).\nWithin S&E fields, undergraduate attrition out of agricultural/ biological sciences and physical/mathematics/computer sciences/engineering fields is greater than transfers into those fields, and transfers into social/behavioral sciences are greater\n\nTable 2-5 Persistence and outcome of postsecondary students beginning 4-year colleges or universities in 1995: 2001\n(Percent)\n\nCumulative persistence outcome 2001\n\nMajor in 1995\n\nAssociate's\n\nStill\n\nNumber Bachelor's or certificate enrolled\n\nNo longer enrolled\n\nMissing\n\nAll majors...................................................................... 1,369,400\n\n58.0\n\nAgricultural/biological sciences ................................ 115,300\n\n60.8\n\nPhysical/math/computer sciences/engineering........ 153,600\n\n59.4\n\nSocial and behavioral sciences ................................ 82,600\n\n62.4\n\nNon-S&E ................................................................... 599,000\n\n57.7\n\nMissing/undeclared .................................................. 418,900\n\n56.3\n\n6.6\n\n14.4\n\n20.8\n\n0.3\n\n4.0\n\n16.7\n\n18.2\n\n0.3\n\n7.3\n\n14.1\n\n19.2\n\n0.1\n\n3.4\n\n14.7\n\n19.1\n\n0.5\n\n7.6\n\n13.2\n\n21.2\n\n0.2\n\n6.1\n\n15.5\n\n21.7\n\n0.4\n\nNOTE: Physical sciences include earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences.\n\nSOURCE: National Center for Education Statistics, 2001 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study, special tabulations (2007).\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 2-23\n\nTable 2-6 Field switching among postsecondary students beginning 4-year colleges and universities in 1995: 2001\n(Percent)\n\nMajor when last enrolled in 2001\n\nMajor in 1995\n\nNumber\n\nPhysical/math/ Agricultural/ computer\nbiological sciences/ sciences engineering\n\nSocial and behavioral sciences\n\nNon-S&E\n\nMissing/ undeclared\n\nAll majors................................................................. 1,369,400\n\n9.9\n\nAgricultural/biological sciences ........................... 115,300\n\n48.9\n\nPhysical/math/computer sciences/engineering... 153,600\n\n5.6\n\nSocial and behavioral sciences ........................... 82,600\n\n3.0\n\nNon-S&E .............................................................. 599,000\n\n3.4\n\nMissing/undeclared ............................................. 418,900\n\n11.0\n\n13.1 9.1\n71.4 3.2 2.7 9.4\n\n15.9\n\n61.1\n\n0.1\n\n11.5\n\n30.5\n\n0.0\n\n3.5\n\n19.6\n\n0.0\n\n64.1\n\n29.6\n\n0.0\n\n8.1\n\n85.9\n\n0.0\n\n22.7\n\n56.7\n\n0.2\n\nNOTE: Physical sciences include earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences.\n\nSOURCE: National Center for Education Statistics, 2001 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study, special tabulations (2007).\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nthan attrition. Among postsecondary students who began at 4-year colleges or universities in 1995\u00ad96 and for whom data on major are available and reported, 12% reported an agricultural/biological sciences major, 16% reported a physical sciences/mathematics/computer sciences/engineering major, and 9% reported a social/behavioral sciences major. Six years later, among those who had attained a bachelor's degree, 10% were agricultural/biological sciences majors, 13% were physical sciences/mathematics/computer sciences/engineering majors, and 16% were social/behavioral sciences majors. (See sidebar \"Effects of Research Experiences on Interest, Retention, and Success.\")\nGraduate Retention\nS&E bachelor's degree recipients are more likely to enroll in and complete graduate training than bachelor's degree recipients in most other fields. Fifty-seven percent of 1992\u00ad93 bachelor's degree recipients in natural sciences and mathematics and 50% of those with bachelor's degrees in social and behavioral sciences enrolled in graduate school by 2003, compared with 25%\u00ad43% of graduates in most other fields (including 39% of engineering graduates). Education graduates also had a high percentage enrolling in graduate school (50%). Forty percent of natural sciences and mathematics bachelor's degree recipients completed an advanced degree program within 10 years, compared with 17%\u00ad31% of graduates in other fields, and 9% had completed a doctoral degree compared with up to 3% of graduates in other fields (table 2-7). Not all of those who completed an advanced degree completed it in an S&E field. The majority of S&E bachelor's degree recipients who earn additional degrees earn them in non-S&E fields (e.g., business, law, or medicine). About onefourth earn additional degrees in the same S&E field, and the remainder earn them in other S&E fields (NSF/SRS 2006b).\nGraduate completion rates are roughly comparable to undergraduate completion rates. Among students enrolled in\n\ndoctoral programs in the early 1990s, about 60% completed doctorates within 10 years. Completion rates vary by discipline, with 64% of engineering students, 62% of life sciences students, and 55% of physical and social sciences students completing doctorates within 10 years (CGS 2005). Timing of graduate attrition varies by discipline. Early attrition from doctoral programs is more common in engineering, physical sciences, and mathematics, and later attrition is more common in humanities and social sciences.\nU.S. Higher Education Degree Awards\nThe number of degrees awarded by U.S. academic institutions has been increasing over the past two decades both in S&E and non-S&E fields. For information on the labor market conditions for recent S&E graduates, see \"Labor Market Conditions for Recent S&E Graduates\" in chapter 3 (Science and Engineering Labor Force) and \"Trends in Academic Employment of Doctoral Scientists and Engineers\" in chapter 5 (Academic Research and Development).\nS&E Associate's Degrees\nCommunity colleges are often an important and relatively inexpensive gateway for students entering higher education. Associate's degrees, largely offered by 2-year programs at community colleges, are the terminal degree for some people, but others continue their education at 4-year colleges or universities and subsequently earn higher degrees.10 Associate's degrees in S&E or engineering technology accounted for about 12% of all associate's degrees in 2005.\nS&E associate's degrees from all types of academic institutions rose from 26,500 in 1985 to 45,700 in 2005. The increase in the late 1990s and the early 2000s is mainly attributable to computer sciences, which represented 61% of all S&E associate's degrees by 2005. In contrast, the number of associate's degrees awarded in engineering mainly\n\n\f2-24 \n\nChapter 2. Higher Education in Science and Engineering\n\nEffects of Research Experiences on Interest, Retention, and Success\n\nOpportunities for students to engage in early experiences as a working scientist or engineer have been in existence for some time. However, formal studies of the outcomes of such opportunities were not undertaken until fairly recently. There is now a growing body of literature that examines the results of such efforts and analyzes them for their effect on at least one of the following outcomes: student attitudes toward science, student research skills, student confidence in his or her ability to become a scientist or engineer, and retention of students within the field, including entry into graduate school or graduation with a doctorate. In general, each study found increases in students' understanding of the scientific process, the way in which research is done, and, to varying degrees, their commitment to majoring in science or engineering, to entering a science or engineering career, and to enrolling in a science or engineering graduate program.\nThese research experiences are often either hands-on research opportunities (participation in an active research laboratory or a didactic laboratory course specifically devoted to working on ongoing research projects) or literature-based research opportunities (participation in a class designed around seminar-type discussion of ongoing research topics or analysis of papers from the primary literature). In engineering, these experiences generally\n\ninclude a freshman design course and/or a sophomore or junior internship.\nA recent comparison of results from nine studies of undergraduate hands-on research experiences (Boylan 2006) reveals some overall consistencies in findings but also some interesting variations. Students who participated in an undergraduate research experience reported, in general, a greater interest in STEM research, greater understanding of the research process and the strategies and tools that scientists use to solve problems, and a broader sense of career options in the field (particularly true of the life sciences when students switched from purely medical to broader career goals). The size of the effect on changes in career or graduate education goals are, to some extent, less consistent. One study (Hunter, Laursen, and Seymour 2007) focused on a small set of institutions and found that participating students with high grade point averages were already committed to a career in S&E and so the research experience, although affirming, did not seem to have a large effect on subsequent entry into a graduate program. Other studies (Barlow and Villarejo 2004; Clewell et al. 2006; Price 2005; Russell, Hancock, and McCullough 2007; Summers and Hrabowski 2006) found that students with a broader range of abilities as well as underrepresented minority students were more likely to stay in or switch to an S&E major and to pursue S&E graduate education.\n\nTable 2-7 1992\u00ad93 bachelor's degree recipients, by graduate enrollment status, highest degree attained, and baccalaureate degree major: 2003\n(Percent)\n\nHighest degree attained\n\nEnrollment in graduate program\n\nAdvanced degree\n\nBaccalaureate degree major\n\nLeft\n\nFirst\n\nAll ever\n\nCurrently without Bachelor's\n\nMaster's professional Doctoral\n\nenrolled Completed enrolled completing degreea All degree degree degree\n\nAll majors................................................ 40.1\n\n24.8\n\n5.9\n\n9.4\n\n74.4 25.6 19.7\n\n4.0\n\n1.9\n\nBusiness and management ................ 25.4\n\n16.6\n\n3.2\n\n5.6\n\n83.3 16.7 14.7\n\n1.8\n\n0.2\n\nEducation............................................ 50.3\n\n28.3\n\n8.1\n\n13.9\n\n71.1 28.9 26.3\n\n1.5\n\n1.1\n\nEngineering ......................................... 39.2\n\n24.5\n\n5.4\n\n9.3\n\n74.2 25.9 22.2\n\n0.9\n\n2.7\n\nHealth.................................................. 36.5\n\n22.0\n\n6.5\n\n8.0\n\n77.9 22.1 19.4\n\n2.1\n\n0.6\n\nPublic affairs/social services............... 36.3\n\n20.6\n\n6.2\n\n9.5\n\n79.4 20.6 18.2\n\n1.8\n\n0.6\n\nHumanities.......................................... 42.6\n\n25.5\n\n7.1\n\n10.1\n\n73.0 27.1 21.5\n\n4.3\n\n1.2\n\nSocial and behavioral sciences .......... 49.8\n\n30.3\n\n8.7\n\n10.8\n\n68.6 31.4 21.8\n\n7.2\n\n2.3\n\nNatural sciences and mathematics .... 56.7\n\n38.6\n\n6.4\n\n11.7\n\n60.3 39.7 18.7\n\n12.0\n\n9.0\n\nOther ................................................... 34.4\n\n21.7\n\n4.2\n\n8.6\n\n77.6 22.4 18.0\n\n3.4\n\n1.0\n\naIncludes postbaccalaureate certificates.\n\nSOURCE: National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), Where Are They Now?

Degrees earned in engineering technology (not included in S&E degree totals because of their practicefocused nature) declined from 53,700 in 1985 to 28,800 in 2005 (appendix table 2-25).\nWomen earned 40% of S&E associate's degrees in 2005, down from 45% in 1985 and less than their percentage of S&E bachelor's degrees (50%). As is the case with men, the largest number of S&E associate's degrees earned by women are in computer sciences (appendix tables 2-25).\nTrends in the number of associate's degrees earned by students' race/ethnicity are shown in appendix table 2-26.11 Students from underrepresented groups earn a considerably higher proportion of associate's degrees than they do of bachelor's or more advanced degrees (figure 2-13). In 2005, they earned more than one-third of all associate's degrees in social and behavioral sciences and almost one-quarter of all associate's degrees in mathematics and computer sciences. The percentage of computer sciences associate's degrees earned by these students almost doubled since 1985.\n\nS&E Bachelor's Degrees\nThe baccalaureate is the most prevalent degree in S&E, accounting for 70% of all S&E degrees awarded. S&E bachelor's degrees consistently accounted for roughly one-third of all bachelor's degrees for the past two decades. Except for a brief downturn in the late 1980s, the number of S&E bachelor's degrees has risen steadily from 332,300 in 1985 to 466,000 in 2005 (appendix table 2-27).\nTrends in the number of S&E bachelor's degrees vary widely among fields (figure 2-14). The number of bachelor's degrees earned in engineering, which peaked in 1985, dropped through most of the 1990s before increasing again through 2005. In computer sciences, the number of bachelor's degrees increased sharply from 1998 to 2004 but fell in 2005. Except for slight dips in the late 1980s and from 1999 to 2002, bachelor's degrees in biological/agricultural sciences have been increasing, reaching a new peak in 2005. The number of social and behavioral sciences degrees awarded rose in the late 1980s and again in the 2000s, reaching a new peak in 2005 (appendix table 2-27).\n\nFigure 2-13 Underrepresented minority share of S&E degrees, by degree level and field: 2005\n\nAssociate's Bachelor's\n\nEngineering\nMathematics/ computer sciences\nPhysical/earth, atmospheric, and ocean/ biological/agricultural sciences\nSocial/behavioral sciences\nNon-S&E\n\nMaster's\n\nDoctoral\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nPercent\n\nNOTE: Underrepresented minority includes black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native.\nSOURCES: National Center for Education Statistics, Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, Completions Survey; and National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Survey of Earned Doctorates, WebCASPAR database, http://webcaspar.nsf.gov.

Higher Education in Science and Engineering\n\nS&E Bachelor's Degrees by Sex Women outnumbered men in undergraduate education\nsince 1982 and earned 58% of all bachelor's degrees in 2005; they earned about half of all S&E bachelor's degrees since 2000. Within S&E, men and women tend to study different fields. Men earned a majority of bachelor's degrees awarded in engineering, computer sciences, and physics (80%, 78%, and 79%, respectively). Women earned more than half of bachelor's degrees in psychology (78%), agricultural sciences (51%), biological sciences (62%), chemistry (52%), and social sciences (54%) (appendix table 2-27). The share of bachelor's degrees awarded to women increased in almost all major S&E fields during the past two decades. One notable exception, however, is computer sciences. From 1985 through 2005, the proportion of computer sciences bachelor's degrees awarded to women dropped from 37% to 22% (figure 2-15). Among fields with notable increases in the proportion of bachelor's degrees awarded to women are earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences (from 25% to 42%); agricultural sciences (from 35% to 51%); and chemistry (from 36% to 52%).\nThe number of S&E bachelor's degrees awarded to women as well as the total number of bachelor's degrees\nFigure 2-15 Female share of S&E bachelor's degrees, by field: 1985\u00ad2005\nPercent 100\n\n80 Psychology\n\n60\n\nBiological/agricultural sciences\n\nSocial sciences\n\nMathematics 40\nPhysical sciences\nComputer sciences\n\n20 Engineering\n\n0 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997\n\n2001 2003 2005\n\nNOTES: Physical sciences include earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences.

See appendix table 2-27.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nin all fields rose from 1985 through 2005, with a brief drop in numbers of engineering and natural sciences degrees in the late 1980s and early 1990s and another decline in 2005. In contrast, the number of S&E bachelor's degrees awarded to men as well as the total number of bachelor's degrees in all fields reached a plateau in the 1990s but increased from 2002 through 2005. The flat numbers of S&E bachelor's degrees awarded to men in the 1990s masked several divergent trends. The number of engineering, physical sciences, and social and behavioral sciences degrees awarded to men dropped in the 1990s, while the number of bachelor's degrees in agricultural and biological sciences generally increased in the 1990s.12\nS&E Bachelor's Degrees by Race/Ethnicity The racial/ethnic composition of those earning S&E\nbachelor's degrees changed over the past two decades, reflecting both population change and increasing college attendance by members of minority groups.13 Between 1985 and 2005, the proportion of S&E degrees awarded to white students declined from 82% to 65%. The proportion awarded to Asians/Pacific Islanders increased from 4% to 9%, to black students from 5% to 8%, to Hispanic students from 4% to 8%, and to American Indian/Alaska Native students from 0.4% to 0.7% (figure 2-16). The number of S&E bachelor's degrees earned by white students decreased in the 1990s as their numbers in the college-age population dropped, but rose again through 2005. The number of S&E bachelor's degrees earned by students of unknown race/ ethnicity also increased. See sidebar \"Increase in Student Nonreporting of Race/Ethnicity.\"\n\nFigure 2-16 Minority share of S&E bachelor's degrees, by race/ ethnicity: 1985\u00ad2005\n\nMinority (%)\n\nWhite (%)\n\n10 White\n\n90 Asian/Pacific Islander\n80\n\n8\n\n70\n\nBlack\n\n60\n\n6 50\n\nHispanic\n\n40\n\n4\n\n30\n\n2\n\n20\n\nAmerican Indian/Alaska Native\n\n10\n\n0 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997\n\n0 2001 2003 2005\n\nNOTE: Data not available for 1986, 1988, and 1999.\nSOURCES: National Center for Education Statistics, Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, Completions Survey; and National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, WebCASPAR database, http://webcaspar.nsf.gov. See appendix table 2-28.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 2-27\n\nIncrease in Student Nonreporting of Race/Ethnicity\nFor several years, the number and percentage of students not reporting race/ethnicity on their college applications and thus the number and percentage of students of unknown race/ethnicity in federal surveys of higher education enrollment and degrees have increased. In 2005, about 25,700 S&E bachelor's degree recipients (almost 6% of the total) were of unknown race/ethnicity, up from about 3,700 (1% of the total) in 1985 (appendix table 2-28). At some colleges and universities, the percentage of students who decline to report race/ethnicity is as high as 25% (JBHE 2005). How the unknown category is treated in data reporting can affect estimates of the composition of the student body and trends in minority enrollment or degree attainment. Inclusion of these students in counts of \"minority\" students or omitting these students from totals or calculations of percentages inflates the number and fraction of minority students.\nLevel of selectivity of the school is a factor, with the most selective colleges and universities having a higher percentage of students not reporting race than is the case for colleges and universities in the United States overall (JBHE 2005). Most students of unknown race/ethnicity are white and another substantial number are thought to be multiple race (Linneman and Chatman 1996; Smith et al. 2005). The reluctance of white students to report race/ethnicity on college admissions forms may reflect a belief that their race/ethnicity would negatively affect admissions decisions. Thus, timing of collection of race/ethnicity data seems to be a factor in the number of students who do or do not report (Smith et al. 2005). Schools that collect race/ethnicity data after students matriculate generally have lower percentages of students not reporting race/ethnicity.\nDespite considerable progress for underrepresented minority groups between 1985 and 2005 in earning bachelor's degrees in any field, the gap in educational attainment between young minorities and whites continues to be wide. The percentage of blacks ages 25\u00ad29 with a bachelor's or higher degree rose from 12% in 1985 to 18% in 2005, whereas the percentage of Hispanics ages 25\u00ad29 with a bachelor's or higher degree was 11% in 1985 and 2005 (NCES 2006). For whites ages 25\u00ad29, this percentage rose from 24% in 1985 to 34% in 2005. Differences in completion of bachelor's degrees in S&E by race/ethnicity reflect differences in high school completion rates, college enrollment rates, and college persistence and attainment rates. In general, blacks and Hispanics are less likely than whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders to graduate from high school, to enroll in college, and to graduate from college (see \"Transition to Higher Education\" in chapter 1 for information on immediate post-\n\nhigh school college enrollment rates). Among those who do enroll in or graduate from college, however, blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians/Alaska Natives are about as likely as whites to choose S&E fields; Asians/Pacific Islanders are more likely than members of other racial/ethnic groups to choose these fields. For Asians/Pacific Islanders, almost half of all bachelor's degrees received are in S&E, compared with about one-third of all bachelor's degrees earned by each of the other racial/ethnic groups.\nThe contrast in field distribution among whites, blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians/Alaska Natives on the one hand and Asians/Pacific Islanders on the other is apparent within S&E fields as well. White, black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native S&E baccalaureate recipients share a similar distribution across broad S&E fields. In 2005, between 9% and 12% of all baccalaureate recipients in each of these racial/ethnic groups earned their degrees in the social sciences; 4% to 5%, in the biological sciences; and 3% to 4% in engineering and in computer sciences. Asian/ Pacific Islander baccalaureate recipients earned higher proportions of their baccalaureates in biological sciences, computer sciences, and engineering (appendix table 2-28).\nFor all racial/ethnic groups (except white), the total number of bachelor's degrees, the number of S&E bachelor's degrees, and the number of bachelor's degrees in most S&E fields (except computer sciences) generally increased over the past two decades. After steep increases since the late 1990s, students in each racial/ethnic group earned sharply fewer bachelor's degrees in computer sciences in 2005. For white students, the total number of bachelor's degrees, the number of S&E bachelor's degrees, and the number of bachelor's degrees in most S&E fields, generally dropped between 1993 and 2001 and increased since then. The number of computer science bachelor's degrees earned by white students dropped in 2004 and 2005 (appendix table 2-28).\nBachelor's Degrees by Citizenship Over the past two decades, students on temporary visas in\nthe United States consistently earned a small share (4%) of S&E degrees at the bachelor's level. However, they earned 8% of bachelor's degrees awarded in computer sciences in 2005 and 7% of those awarded in engineering. The number of S&E bachelor's degrees awarded to students on temporary visas increased over the past two decades from about 14,100 in 1985 to 18,400 in 2005. Trends in the number of degrees by field generally followed the pattern noted above for all racial/ethnic groups except whites (appendix table 2-28).\nS&E Master's Degrees\nMaster's degrees are often the terminal degree for students in some fields, for example, engineering and geology. In other fields, master's degrees are a step toward a doctoral degree, and in yet others, master's degrees are awarded when students fail to advance to the doctoral level. A relatively new development, professional master's\n\n\f2-28 \n\nChapter 2. Higher Education in Science and Engineering\n\ndegrees, often stress interdisciplinary training and preparation for work in emerging fields (NSB 2006).\nMaster's degrees in S&E fields increased from 70,600 in 1985 to 120,000 in 2005 (appendix table 2-29). Increases occurred in most major S&E fields. Master's degrees in engineering and physical sciences dipped from 1995 to 2002 but increased in recent years, and master's degrees in computer sciences generally increased through 2004 but dropped in 2005 (figure 2-17).\nMaster's Degrees by Sex Since 1985, the number of S&E master's degrees earned\nby women more than doubled, rising from 22,300 to 53,100 in 2005 (figure 2-18). The number of master's degrees earned by men grew more slowly from 48,200 in 1985 to 67,000 in 2005, with most of the growth between 2002 and 2004. As a result, the percentage of women earning master's degrees rose steadily during the past two decades. In 1985, women earned 32% of all S&E master's degrees; by 2005, they earned 44% (appendix table 2-29).\nWomen's share of S&E master's degrees varies by field. In 2005, women earned a majority of master's degrees in psychology (79%), biological sciences (60%), social sci-\nFigure 2-17 S&E master's degrees, by field: 1985\u00ad2005\nThousands 40\n\n30\n\nEngineering 20\n\nSocial sciences\nComputer sciences\n\nPsychology\n\n10 Biological/agricultural sciences\n\nPhysical sciences Mathematics\n\n0 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997\n\n2001 2003 2005\n\nNOTES: Physical sciences include earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences.

The number and percentage of master's degrees awarded to women in all major S&E fields (with the exception of computer sciences) increased since 1985. In computer sciences, the number of master's degrees awarded to women increased through 2004 but dropped in 2005, and the percentage of degrees awarded to women dropped from 34% in 2001 to 28% in 2005.\nMaster's Degrees by Race/Ethnicity The number of S&E master's degrees awarded increased\nfor all racial/ethnic groups from 1985 to 2005, although degrees to white students dropped from 1996 to 2002 before increasing again (figure 2-19).14 Trends in the number of master's degrees by field were similar for most racial/ethnic groups except white. For most groups, the number of master's degrees in engineering, biological sciences, and social and behavioral sciences generally rose throughout the period 1985\u00ad2005. The number of master's degrees in physical sciences generally dropped, especially from 1995 to 2005, and the number of master's degrees in computer sciences generally increased but dropped sharply in 2005. Master's degrees awarded to American Indian/Alaska Native students generally followed this pattern except for drops in most fields in 2005. Master's degrees awarded to Asian/Pacific Islander students generally followed this pattern except for a drop in the number of engineering degrees from 1997 to 2002. For white students, the number of master's degrees awarded in most S&E fields dropped in the mid-1990s through 2002 before increasing again through 2005. As was the case for most racial/ethnic groups, the number of computer science\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 2-29\n\nFigure 2-19 S&E master's degrees, by race/ethnicity and citizenship: 1985\u00ad2005\nThousands\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\nWhite Temporary resident\n\nAsian/Pacific Islander\n\n30\n\nBlack Hispanic\n\nAmerican Indian/Alaska Native\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997\n\n2001 2003 2005\n\nNOTES: Race/ethnicity includes U.S. citizens and permanent residents.

See appendix table 2-30.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nmaster's degrees earned by white students rose through 2004 but dropped sharply in 2005 (appendix table 2-30).\nThe proportion of master's degrees in S&E fields earned by U.S. citizen and permanent resident racial and ethnic minorities increased over the past two decades. Asians/ Pacific Islanders accounted for 7% of master's degrees in 2005, up from 5% in 1985. Blacks and Hispanics also registered gains during this period (from 3% to 6% for blacks and from 2% to 4% for Hispanics). American Indians/ Alaska Natives earned 0.4% of S&E master's degrees in 1985 and 2005. The percentage of S&E master's degrees earned by white students fell from 68% in 1985 to 47% in 2005 as the percentage of degrees earned by minorities and temporary residents increased (appendix table 2-30).\nMaster's Degrees by Citizenship S&E master's degrees awarded to students on temporary\nvisas rose from approximately 12,500 in 1985 to about 33,500 in 2005, and increased in most S&E fields during that period. The number of degrees generally rose through 2004 but dropped in 2005, especially in computer sciences and engineering. The number of physical sciences and biological sciences master's degrees earned by students on temporary visas dropped in the mid-1990s but increased from 2002 to 2005.\nForeign students make up a much higher proportion of S&E master's degree recipients than they do of bachelor's or associate's degree recipients. During the past two decades, the share of S&E master's degrees earned by temporary residents rose from 19% to 28%. Their degrees are heavily concentrated in computer sciences and engineering, where they\n\nearned 42% and 44%, respectively, of all master's degrees awarded in 2005 (appendix table 2-30). Within engineering, students on temporary visas earned more than half of master's degrees in chemical engineering (51%) and in electrical engineering (55%). Temporary residents also earned a high share of master's degrees in economics (49%).\nS&E Doctoral Degrees\nGlobal economic competition and the spreading conviction that highly educated workforces are key to successfully building growth economies increased interest both in the United States and abroad in the supply of foreign and domestic doctorate recipients and their migration across borders.\nThe number of S&E research doctorates conferred annually by U.S. universities reached a new peak of almost 30,000 in 2005.15 After rising from the mid-1980s through 1998, the number of S&E doctorates declined through 2002 but increased in recent years. (For information on employment of recent doctorate recipients, see \"Labor Market Conditions for Recent S&E Graduates\" in chapter 3, Science and Engineering Labor Force, and \"Trends in Academic Employment of Doctoral Scientists and Engineers\" in chapter 5, Academic Research and Development.) The increases through the mid-1990s as well as the recent growth through 2005 largely reflected growth in the number of foreign degree recipients. The largest increases were in engineering and biological/ agricultural sciences (figure 2-20). The 2003 through 2005 increases in earned doctorates reflect more degrees earned by both U.S. citizens and non-U.S. citizens (see the discussion in this chapter on foreign S&E doctorate recipients).\nDoctoral Degrees by Sex Among U.S. citizens, the proportion of S&E doctoral de-\ngrees earned by women has risen considerably in the past two decades, reaching a record high of 46% in 2005 (appendix table 2-31). During this period, women made gains in all major fields. However, as figure 2-21 shows, considerable differences by field continue. Women earn half or more of doctorates in non-S&E fields, in social/behavioral sciences, and in life sciences, but they earn considerably less than half of doctorates in physical sciences (29%), math/computer sciences (24%), and engineering (20%) (appendix table 2-31). Although the percentages of degrees earned by women in these fields is low, they are substantially higher than was the case in 1985 (16%, 17%, and 9%, respectively).\nThe increase in the proportion of S&E doctoral degrees earned by women resulted from both an increase in the number of women and a decrease in the number of men earning such degrees. The number of U.S. citizen women earning doctorates in S&E increased from 4,400 in 1985 to 7,500 in 2005 (appendix table 2-31). Meanwhile, the number of S&E doctorates earned by U.S. citizen men declined from 9,300 in 1985 to 8,600 in 2005. The increase in the number of S&E doctorates earned by women occurred in most major S&E fields. For example, the number of engineering doctorates earned by U.S. citizen women increased from 119 in 1985\n\n\f2-30 \n\nFigure 2-20 S&E doctoral degrees earned in U.S. universities, by field: 1985\u00ad2005\nThousands\n9\n\n8 Social/behavioral sciences\n7\n\n6 Biological/ agricultural sciences\n5\n4\n\nEngineering Physical sciences\n\n3\n\n2\n\nMedical/other life sciences\n\nMathematics 1\nComputer sciences\n\n0 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005\n\nNOTE: Physical sciences include earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences.\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Survey of Earned Doctorates, WebCASPAR database, http://webcaspar.nsf.gov.

A decrease in the number of doctorates earned by men after the mid-1990s occurred in non-S&E fields as well as in engineering and in most science fields (except for biological sciences and medical/other life sciences).16\nDoctoral Degrees by Race/Ethnicity The number and proportion of doctoral degrees in S&E\nfields earned by U.S. citizen underrepresented minorities also increased over the past two decades. Blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians/Alaska Natives together earned almost 1,600 S&E doctorates in 2005, accounting for 5% of all S&E doctorate degrees earned that year, up from 3% in 1985. (Their share of S&E doctorate degrees earned by all U.S. citizens rose from 4% to 10% in the same period.) Gains by all groups contributed to this rise. The number of S&E degrees earned by blacks and Hispanics more than doubled in this period and the number of S&E degrees earned by American Indians/Alaska Natives increased from 43 to 70 (figure 2-22).\nThe underrepresented minority share of doctorates in some S&E fields is greater than in others. In 2005, blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians/Alaska Natives as a group earned 11% of doctoral degrees in psychology, 9% in medical/ other life sciences, 8% in social sciences, and 6% in biological sciences. In most other S&E fields they earned approximately 3% of doctoral degrees awarded in 2005 (appendix table 2-32). In non-S&E fields, they earned 11% of doctorates in 2005. Among U.S. citizens only, they earned 15% of nonS&E doctorates.\nIn the mid-1990s, the number of doctoral degrees earned by Asian/Pacific Islander U.S. citizens showed a steep increase. Asians/Pacific Islanders earned more than 4% of\n\nFigure 2-22 U.S. citizen underrepresented minority S&E doctoral degrees, by race/ethnicity: 1985\u00ad2005\nNumber\n900\n\n800\n\n700\n\n600\n\n500\n\nHispanic\n\n400 Black\n300\n\n200 American Indian/Alaska Native\n100\n\n0 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Survey of Earned Doctorates, WebCASPAR database, http://webcaspar.nsf.gov.

They earned relatively larger shares of doctoral degrees in biological sciences (7%) and medical sciences (8%), and relatively smaller shares in agricultural sciences (1%) and earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences (2%).\nThe number of S&E doctorates earned by white U.S. citizens remained relatively stable over the past two decades, fluctuating from around 12,000 to 14,000 degrees awarded annually; however, the proportion of S&E doctoral degrees earned by white U.S. citizens decreased. The share of all doctoral S&E degrees earned by white U.S. citizens decreased from 63% in 1985 to 43% in 2005 as the number and percentage of S&E doctorates earned by non-U.S. citizens and minorities increased, and the white U.S. citizen share of degrees awarded to all U.S. citizens declined from 90% to 79% as the number and percentage of S&E doctorates earned by minorities increased (appendix table 2-32). Although the total number of doctoral S&E degrees earned by white U.S. citizens remained fairly stable over the past two decades, the number of S&E doctoral degrees earned by white male U.S. citizens declined in the mid-1990s through 2002 (from about 8,600 in 1994 to 6,900 in 2002) and remained around that same number through 2005 (figure 2-23). The number of degrees earned by white U.S. citizen females generally increased over much of the past three decades, with the exception of brief declines in 2001 and 2002. The drop in doctoral degrees to whites corresponds to the earlier drop in the college age population mentioned previously in this chapter.\n\nFigure 2-23 S&E doctoral degrees, by sex, race/ethnicity, and citizenship: 1985\u00ad2005\nThousands\n14\n\n12\nForeign 10\n\n8 U.S. citizen white male\n\n6\n\nU.S. citizen white female\n\n4\n\nOther/unknown sex,\n\nrace/ethnicity, and\n\nU.S. citizen minority\n\n2\n\ncitizenship\n\n0 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005\nNOTES: Foreign includes permanent and temporary residents.

During this period, the number of S&E doctorates earned by U.S. citizens fluctuated from approximately 14,000 to about 17,000, while the number earned by temporary residents rose from 4,200 to a peak of 10,800 in 2005. The temporary resident share of S&E doctorates rose from 21% in 1985 to 36% in 2005. The number of S&E doctorates earned by students with permanent resident visas increased from about 1,000 in 1985 to a peak of 3,614 in 1995, before falling to about 1,200 in 2005 (appendix table 2-32). (In the mid-1990s, the number of doctorates awarded to students with permanent resident visas showed a steep increase when a large number of Chinese doctoral degree students on temporary visas shifted to permanent resident status under the 1992 Chinese Student Protection Act.)\nForeign students on temporary visas earn a larger proportion of their degrees at the doctoral level than at any other level (figure 2-24). Their proportion in some fields is even higher. For example, in 2005, foreign students on temporary visas earned half or more of doctoral degrees awarded in engineering, mathematics, computer sciences, physics, and economics. They earned considerably lower proportions of doctoral degrees in other S&E fields, for example, 26% in biological sciences, 22% in medical/other life sciences, and 6% in psychology (appendix table 2-32).\nCountries/Economies of Origin The top 10 foreign countries/economies of origin of for-\neign S&E doctorate recipients together accounted for 65% of all foreign recipients of a U.S. S&E doctorate from 1985 to 2005 (table 2-8). All but 2 of those top 10 countries are located in Asia. The major Asian countries/economies sending doctoral degree students to the United States have been, in descending order, China, Taiwan, South Korea, and India. (Canada and Mexico were also among the top 10.)\nAsia. The number of U.S. S&E doctorates earned by students from Asia increased from the mid-1980s until the midto late 1990s, followed by a brief decline and then increases in recent years (figure 2-25). Most of these degrees were awarded in engineering and biological and physical sciences (table 2-9). From 1985 to 2005, students from four Asian countries/economies (China, Taiwan, India, and South Korea) earned more than half of U.S. S&E doctoral degrees award-\n\n\f2-32 \n\nChapter 2.

These students received almost 42,000 S&E doctoral degrees from U.S. universities, mainly in biological and physical sciences and engineering (table 2-9). The number of S&E doctorates earned by Chinese nationals increased from 151 in 1985 to more than 3,500 in 2005 (figure 2-25).17\nStudents from Taiwan received the second-largest number of S&E doctorates at U.S. universities. Between 1985 and 2005, students from Taiwan earned more than 19,000 S&E doctoral degrees, mainly in engineering and biological and physical sciences (table 2-9). In 1985, they earned more U.S. S&E doctoral degrees than students from India and China combined. The number of U.S. S&E doctoral degrees earned by students from Taiwan increased rapidly for almost a decade, from 854 in 1985 to more than 1,300 at its peak in 1994. However, as universities in Taiwan increased their capacity for advanced S&E education in the 1990s, the number of students from Taiwan earning S&E doctorates from U.S. universities declined to 488 in 2005 (figure 2-25).\nStudents from India earned more than 18,700 S&E doctoral degrees at U.S. universities over the period. Like students from China and Taiwan, they mainly earned doctorates in engineering and biological and physical sciences. They also earned by far the largest number (1,515) of U.S. doctoral degrees awarded to any foreign group in computer sciences.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 2-33\n\nTable 2-9 Asian recipients of U.S. S&E doctorates, by field and country/economy of origin: 1985\u00ad2005\n\nField\n\nAsia\n\nChina\n\nTaiwan\n\nIndia\n\nSouth Korea\n\nAll fields ......................................................................

The number of S&E doctoral degrees earned by students from India increased from 2003 through 2005.\nStudents from South Korea earned almost 19,000 U.S. S&E doctorates from 1985 to 2005, mainly in engineering and biological, social, and physical sciences. The number of S&E doctoral degrees earned by South Korean students increased from about 350 in 1985 to 1,178 in 1994, declined to a low of about 800 in the late 1990s, and increased to 1,200 in 2005 (figure 2-25).\nEurope. European students earned far fewer U.S. S&E doctorates (25,500) than did Asian students (130,400) between 1985 and 2005, and they tended to focus less on engineering than did their Asian counterparts (table 2-10). Western European countries whose students earned the largest number of U.S. S&E doctorates from 1985 to 2005 were Germany, the United Kingdom, Greece, Italy, and France, in that order. From 1985 to 1993, Greece and the United Kingdom were the primary European countries of origin; thereafter, their numbers of doctoral degree recipients declined. The numbers of U.S. S&E doctorate recipients from Germany, Italy, and France generally increased over the past two decades, although doctorate recipients from Germany declined in recent years (figure 2-26). Scandinavians received fewer U.S. doctorates than did students from the other European regions, with a field distribution roughly similar to that for other Western Europeans (table 2-10).\nThe number of Central and Eastern European students earning S&E doctorates at U.S. universities increased from fewer than 70 in 1985 to more than 800 in 2005 (figure 2-27). A higher proportion of Central and Eastern European\n\nU.S. doctorate recipients (88%) than of Western European doctorate recipients (73%) earned their doctorates in S&E fields. Western Europeans earned U.S. S&E doctorates mainly in engineering and biological, physical, and social sciences. Central and Eastern Europeans earned U.S. S&E doctorates mainly in engineering, biological sciences, physical sciences, and mathematics (table 2-10).\nNorth America. The Canadian and Mexican shares of U.S. S&E doctoral degrees were small compared with those from Asia and Europe. The number of U.S. S&E degrees earned by students from Canada increased from less than 200 in 1985 to almost 400 in 2005. In all, 64% of Canadian doctoral degree students in U.S. universities earned S&E doctorates, mainly in social and biological sciences (figure 2-28; table 2-10). Mexican doctoral degree students in U.S. universities are more concentrated in S&E fields than are Canadian students: 85% of doctoral degrees earned by Mexican students at U.S. universities were in S&E fields, mainly engineering and agricultural, biological, and social sciences. The number of doctoral degree recipients from Mexico increased from 111 in 1985 to more than 200 in 2005.\nStay Rates Of the approximately 3.4 million immigrant scientists\nand engineers residing in the United States in 2003, about 30% initially came to the United States for educational opportunities and then remained in this country (NSF/SRS 2007b). This section examines data on foreign S&E doctorate recipients' plans for staying in the United States at the time of doctorate receipt. Chapter 3 provides data based on examination of Social Security records on the percentage of foreign students with U.S. S&E doctorates who remain in the U.S. labor force up to 5 years after graduation.\n\n\f2-34 \n\nChapter 2.

Until the early 1990s, about half of foreign students who earned S&E degrees at U.S. universities reported that they planned to stay in the United States after graduation, and about one-third said they had firm offers for postdoctoral study or employment (NSB 1998). In the 1990s, however, these percentages increased substantially. In the 1994\u00ad97 period, for example, of the foreign S&E doctoral degree recipients who reported their plans, 71% planned to remain in the United States after receiving their degree and 39% already had firm offers for postdoctoral study or employment. In the 2002\u00ad05 period, 74% of foreign doctoral recipients in S&E fields with known plans intended to stay in the United States and 49% had firm offers to do so (appendix table 2-33). Higher percentages of foreign doctorate recipients in physical sciences and mathematics/computer sciences and lower percentages of those in social/behavioral sciences reported firm plans to stay. The percentage of students who had firm plans to remain in the United States dropped after 2001 but increased in 2005 (figure 2-29).\nStay rates vary by place of origin. In the 2002\u00ad05 period, more than 90% of U.S. S&E doctoral recipients from China and 88% of those from India reported plans to stay in the United States, and 60% and 63%, respectively, reported accepting firm offers for employment or postdoctoral\n\nFigure 2-29 Plans of foreign recipients of U.S. S&E doctorates to stay in United States: 1985\u00ad2005\n\nThousands (dashed line)\n\nPercent (solid lines)\n\n30\n\n100\n\n25 80\n\n20\n\nPlans to stay\n\n60\n\n15\n\nFirm plans to stay\n\n40\n\n10\n\n5\n\nRecipients\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005\n\nNOTES: Degree recipients include permanent and temporary residents.

China and India are the two major countries of origin from which the percentage of U.S. S&E doctorate recipients with definite plans to stay in the United States dropped from 1998\u00ad2001 to 2002\u00ad05. The drops were almost entirely among computer science doctorate recipients from India and engineering doctorate recipients from India and China. Stay rates for Chinese and Indian U.S. doctorate recipients in the biological/agricultural/health sciences and physical/ earth/atmospheric/ocean sciences increased or stayed about the same from 1998\u00ad2001 to 2002\u00ad05, and those in social/ behavioral sciences stayed about the same or dropped slightly.\nDoctorate recipients from Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea were less likely than those from India and China to stay in the United States. Over the same 2002\u00ad05 period, 39% of S&E doctoral degree recipients from Taiwan, 41% of those from Japan, and 43% of those from South Korea reported accepting firm offers to remain in the United States.\nAmong U.S. S&E doctoral degree recipients from Europe, a relatively high percentage from the United Kingdom planned to stay, whereas smaller percentages from Greece, Italy, and Spain (compared with other Western European countries) planned to stay after graduation. The percentage of 2002\u00ad05 doctoral degree students who had firm plans to stay in the United States was higher for Canada (51%) than for Mexico (31%) (appendix table 2-33).\n\n\f2-36 \n\nChapter 2.

Typically, postdoctoral fellows or \"postdocs\" have temporary appointments involving full-time research or scholarship whose purpose is to further their education and training. The titles associated with these positions and the conditions of employment vary widely. The status of postdoctoral fellows within the academic hierarchy is not well defined and varies among institutions, although the concept that the postdoctoral experience represents the last step on\n\na person's training for becoming an independent investigator and faculty member is generally accepted (COSEPUP 2000). Postdoctoral fellows are also important contributors to academic research. They bring a new set of techniques and perspectives to the laboratory that broadens the experience of the research team and can make them more competitive for additional research funding. Chapter 3 provides more detail on postdoctoral employment, including reasons for and length of postdoc position as well as salaries and subsequent employment. Chapter 5 provides more detail on postdocs in the academic R&D setting.\nSince 1985, the number of doctoral degree recipients with science, engineering, and health postdoctoral appointments at U.S. universities more than doubled from 22,400 to 48,700 in 2005 (appendix table 2-34). More than two-thirds of those were in biological, medical, and other life sciences (figure 2-31).18\nNoncitizens account for much of the increase in the number of S&E postdocs, especially in biological sciences and medical and other life sciences. The number of S&E postdocs with temporary visas at U.S. universities increased from approximately 8,900 in 1985 to 27,000 in 2005. The number of U.S. citizen and permanent resident S&E postdocs at these institutions increased more modestly from approximately 13,500 in 1985 to 21,700 in 2005 (figure 2-32; appendix table 2-34). Temporary visa holders accounted for 55% of S&E postdocs in 2005.\nAn increasing share of academic S&E postdocs are funded through federal research grants.

In 2005, the remainder (about 30%) of S&E postdocs were funded through nonfederal sources (table 2-11).\nGlobal Trends in Higher Education in S&E\nIn the 1990s, many countries worldwide expanded their higher education systems as well as access to higher education in their country. At the same time, flows of students worldwide increased, particularly from developing countries to more developed countries, and from Europe and Asia to the United States. More recently, a number of countries adopted policies to encourage the return of students who studied abroad, to attract foreign students, or both.\n\nEducational Attainment\nEducational attainment of the U.S. population has long been among the highest in the world, but other countries are now catching up (OECD 2006). The United States continues to have the highest percentage of the population ages 25\u00ad 64 with a bachelor's degree or higher, although among the younger age group (ages 25\u00ad34), the United States (30%) lags behind Norway (37%), Israel (34%), the Netherlands (32%), and South Korea (31%) in the percentage of the population with at least a bachelor's degree (figure 2-33; appendix table 2-35).\nThe percentage of the population with postsecondary degrees of any sort increased greatly in Europe and in many Asian countries over the past decade. Many other countries, including Russia, Israel, Belgium, Canada, Finland, and Sweden have traditionally had relatively high percentages of the population with education levels broadly comparable to U.S. associate's degrees (tertiary type B in international classification). Recently, increases in population shares with this level of education have occurred in France, Ireland, Japan, and South Korea, among other countries; these increases are often accompanied by increases in those with bachelor's level qualifications (tertiary type A) or better. In total postsecondary education attainment of the population ages 25 to 64 (including 2-year and 4-year or higher degrees), the United States ranks 4th (behind Russia, Israel, and Canada), and it ranks 10th (behind Russia, Canada, Japan, Israel, South Korea, Sweden, Belgium, Ireland, and Norway) in the percentage of the younger population (ages 25\u00ad34) with any postsecondary degree (appendix table 2-36).\nFirst University Degrees in S&E Fields\nIn 2004, almost 11 million students worldwide earned a first university degree19 with almost 4 million of these in S&E fields (appendix table 2-37). These worldwide totals include only countries for which relatively recent data are available (primarily countries in the Asian, European, and American regions), and therefore are likely an underestimation. Asian universities accounted for 1.7 million of the world's S&E\n\nTable 2-11 Source of funding of S&E postdoctoral students: 1985\u00ad2005\n(Percent distribution)\n\nSource\n\n1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005\n\nAll sources ............................

Higher Education in Science and Engineering\n\nfirst university degrees in 2004, more than 700,000 of them in engineering (figure 2-34). Students across Europe (including Eastern Europe and Russia) earned more than 1 million S&E degrees, and students in North and Central America more than 600,000 in 2004.\nIn the United States, S&E degrees are about one-third of U.S. bachelor's degrees. In several countries/economies around the world, the proportion of first degrees in S&E fields, especially engineering, is higher. More than half of first degrees were in S&E fields in Japan (63%), China (56%), Singapore (59%), Laos (57%), and Thailand (69%). Many of these countries/economies traditionally awarded a large proportion of their first degrees in engineering. In the United States, about 5% of all bachelor's degrees are in engineering. However, in Asia, 20% are in engineering, and in many other countries worldwide, more than 10% are in engineering. About 12% of all bachelor's degrees in the United States and worldwide are in natural sciences (physical, biological, computer, and agricultural sciences, and mathematics).\nThe number of first university S&E degrees awarded in China, South Korea, and the United Kingdom more than doubled between 1985 and 2005; those in the United States generally increased; and those in Japan decreased in recent years (appendix table 2-38). In China, the number of first university degrees in engineering more than doubled between 2000 and 2004 and quadrupled over the past two decades (figure 2-35). Degrees in the physical and biological sciences also greatly increased in China in those years.

In both the United States and United Kingdom, the number of first university degrees in mathematics/computer sciences and social/behavioral sciences generally increased over the past two decades, while the number awarded in physical/biological sciences and engineering dipped in recent years (although in the United States, degrees in those disciplines have since rebounded). In Japan, the number of first university S&E degrees rose in the 1990s but decreased from 2002 through 2005. In Germany, the number of first university S&E degrees dropped from 1997 through 2001 but increased in recent years.\nGlobal Comparison of Participation Rates by Sex\nWomen earned half or more of first university degrees in S&E in many countries around the world in 2004, including the United States, Canada, Greece, Portugal, Panama, and several countries in Asia, the middle East, and Eastern\nRecent Developments in Higher Education in China\nMajor education reform efforts in China began in the late 1990s. These efforts focused on consolidating and strengthening higher education institutions, expanding disciplines offered, increasing funding, and improving teaching. As a consequence, enrollment in higher education in China increased sharply (Hsiung 2007). Since 1998, undergraduate enrollment in colleges and universities increased from 0.3 million to 13.3 million in 2004, and 4-year degrees increased from 405,000 to 1.2 million (National Bureau of Statistics of China 2005). Although enrollment and degree production increased exponentially, the per capita rate of college attendance remains low (Hsiung 2007). In addition to expansion of 4-year colleges and universities, vocational and technical education also expanded. The number of vocational and technical schools increased from 101 in 1998 to 872 in 2004, and enrollments rose to 5.96 million students (45% of all college students) in 2004 (Hsiung 2007). Current reform efforts focus on improving quality of instruction, slowing the growth in college enrollment to 5% per year, and targeting advanced education.\nThe increased growth in enrollment and degree production over the past few years has increasingly been outside of S&E fields. Historically, almost half of bachelor's recipients in China earned degrees in engineering, but although the numbers of degrees in engineering have increased, the percentage has been steadily decreasing over time. In 1994, 46% were in engineering; by 2004, 37% were in engineering (appendix table 2-38) as the number and percentage of degrees in business, literature, education, and law increased.\n\n\f2-40 \n\nChapter 2. Higher Education in Science and Engineering\n\nRecent Developments in Higher Education in India\nOver the past two decades, higher education in India expanded rapidly (Agarwal 2006). Enrollment increased from 2.8 million in 1980 to 9.9 million in 2003 (Ministry of Science and Technology 2006). Most of the growth is due to an increase in the number of private colleges, many of which are polytechnics and industrial training institutes. Foreign education providers also increased their presence. In 2005, 131 foreign providers of higher education, mainly from the United States and United Kingdom, enrolled students mostly in vocational or technical fields (Agarwal 2006). Despite high numbers of students enrolled, the percentage of the college age population who enroll in higher education in India is low (13%) (Thorat 2006).\nThe growth of higher education in India resulted in several challenges, including questions of adequacy of facilities, space, and resources; institutional quality and standards; and quality of faculty and instructional methods (Chatterjea and Moulik 2006). There is wide disparity in the perceived quality of schools. The Indian Institutes of Management and the Indian Institutes of Technology are generally regarded as top-quality schools. According to Giridharadas (2006), graduates of second-tier schools face high unemployment as their knowledge and skills are considered not up to par. Another observer (Agarwal 2006) states that the expansion of higher education also resulted in mismatches between supply and demand. He reported that in 2001, about 17% of higher education graduates were unemployed and nearly 40% were not, or were not fully, productively employed.\nAlthough data on enrollments are available, up-todate definitive statistics on Indian higher education degrees are not. Higher education institutions are not required to provide information and response rates to voluntary data collections are low.\nEurope. A number of countries in Europe are not far behind, with more than 40% of first university S&E degrees earned by women. In many Asian and African countries, women generally earn about one-third or less of the first university degrees awarded in S&E fields (appendix table 2-39). In the United States, Canada, Japan, and many smaller countries, over half of the S&E first university degrees earned by women are in the social and behavioral sciences. In a few countries (e.g., El Salvador, South Korea, and several countries in Eastern Europe), more than 40% of S&E first university degrees earned by women are in engineering, compared with 6% in the United States.\n\nGlobal Comparison of S&E Doctoral Degrees\nAlmost 150,000 S&E doctoral degrees were earned worldwide in 2004. Of these, more than 80% were earned outside the United States (appendix table 2-40). The United States awarded the largest number of S&E doctoral degrees (more than 26,000), followed by Russia (16,000), China (almost 15,000), and Germany (more than 12,000). Close to 40% of these S&E doctoral degrees in the United States and worldwide were earned in the physical/biological sciences. Figure 2-36 shows the breakdown of S&E doctoral degrees by major region and selected fields.\nWomen earned 37% of S&E doctoral degrees awarded in the United States and about 34% of those earned worldwide in 2004. The percentage of S&E doctoral degrees earned by women varied widely by country/economy, from less than 20% in South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Iran, and Ghana, to more than 50% in Kyrgyzstan, the Philippines, Uganda, Portugal, Latvia, and Lithuania (appendix table 2-41).\nThe number of S&E doctoral degrees awarded in the United Kingdom and in many Asian countries rose steeply in the past two decades (appendix tables 2-42 and 2-43). The United States awards the largest number of natural sciences and engineering doctoral degrees, but China is catching up (figure 2-37). In the United Kingdom, as well as in Germany and the United States, most S&E doctoral degrees are in the physical and biological sciences. The numbers of doctoral degrees in those fields stagnated or declined from the late 1990s through 2005, although the number of these degrees in the United States experienced a recent upturn. Most of the recent growth in S&E doctoral degrees in the United Kingdom was due to an increase in the number of social and behavioral sciences doctorates.\n\nFigure 2-36 S&E doctoral degrees earned in Europe, Asia, and North America, by field: 2004 or most recent year\n\nThousands\n\n40\n\nNatural Sciences\n\nEngineering\n\nSocial/behavioral sciences\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0 Europe\n\nAsia\n\nNorth America\n\nNOTES: Natural sciences include physical, biological, earth, atmospheric, ocean, agricultural, and computer sciences and mathematics.

The number of S&E doctorates awarded in China rose more than sixfold between 1993 and 2004, and the number of S&E doctorates awarded in South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan also greatly increased. In China, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, more than half of S&E doctorates were awarded in engineering. In India, the number of S&E doctoral degrees rose more modestly, although there was still a 58% increase from 1985 through 2003, and most doctorates were awarded in the physical and biological sciences (appendix table 2-43).\nGlobal Student Mobility\nInternational migration of students and highly skilled workers expanded in the past two decades, and countries are increasingly competing for foreign students. In particular,\n\nmigration of students occurred from developing countries to the more developed countries, and from Europe and Asia to the United States. Some migrate temporarily for education, whereas others remain permanently. Some of the factors that influence the decision to migrate are economic opportunities, research opportunities, research funding, and climate for innovation in the country of destination (OECD 2004).\nThe population of individuals ages 20\u00ad24 (a proxy for the college-age population) decreased in Europe, the United States, China, and Japan in the 1990s and is projected to continue decreasing in Europe and Japan (appendix table 2-44). Some countries expanded recruitment of foreign students as their own populations of college-age students decreased, both for attraction of highly skilled workers and also for increased revenue for colleges and universities. (See sidebar \"Transnational Higher Education.\")\nThe U.S. share of foreign students worldwide declined in recent years, although the United States remains the destination of the largest number of foreign students worldwide (both undergraduate and graduate) of all Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries (figure 2-38). In 2004, the United States received 22% of foreign students worldwide, down from 25% in 2000 (OECD 2006). Other countries that are among the top destinations for foreign students include the United Kingdom (11%), Germany (10%), and France (9%). Although they have lower numbers of foreign students than the United States, several other countries have higher percentages of higher education\nTransnational Higher Education\nUniversities in the United States and abroad are establishing branch campuses and programs in other countries. In the past, cross-border higher education largely involved study abroad programs. More recently, it involved establishing programs for foreign students in their home countries. For countries in which these branch campuses are established, these efforts provide a means to curb \"brain drain,\" increase educational opportunities, and potentially attract more international students (McBurnie and Ziguras 2006). Some of the major sites for transnational delivery of higher education include China, India, and Singapore. For countries that establish branch campuses abroad, the benefits of these efforts include increased enrollment and revenue, greater opportunities for student and staff mobility, and prestige. The major countries providing transnational higher education include the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The United States accounts for the majority of institutions offering transnational delivery (Verbik and Merkley 2006). Problems with this type of delivery include issues of governance, quality control, and access; the stability of the institution; and the range of disciplines offered.\n\n\f2-42 \n\nChapter 2.

In Australia 17% of students in higher education are foreign; in Switzerland and the United Kingdom, 13%; and in Austria, 11%, compared with 3% in the United States. Many countries (the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and New Zealand) recently instituted policies to help facilitate immigration of foreign students (Suter and Jandl 2006). Major policy efforts in Europe promoted increased international mobility of students. In the European Union, a substantial number of foreign students come from other European Union countries, but large numbers are also from Eastern Europe, Africa, and Asia, especially China and India (Kelo, Teichler, and W\u00e4chter 2006; Suter and Jandl 2006).\nForeign student enrollment in the United Kingdom increased in the past decade. The proportion of foreign students studying S&E fields in the United Kingdom also\n\nincreased, especially at the graduate level, with increasing flows of students from China and India. From 1994 to 2005, foreign students increased from 29% to 43% of all graduate students studying S&E in the United Kingdom. In graduate engineering, foreign student enrollment more than doubled from 9,300 (35% of enrollment) to 21,400 (55% of enrollment) (figure 2-39; appendix table 2-45). Students from China, Greece, India, and Pakistan accounted for most of the increase in foreign graduate engineering enrollment. The prime minister's current Initiative for International Education calls for attracting an additional 100,000 international students by 2011 and provides about $48 million in funding to increase the number of international students in the United Kingdom. It also calls for diversifying the countries from which they draw students and also maintaining quality. The previous initiative (which exceeded its goals), called for increasing the number of students by 75,000 between 1999\nFigure 2-39 S&E foreign graduate student enrollment, by selected industrialized country and field: 2005\nUnited Kingdom\n\nUnited States\n\nNA Japan\n\nPhysical/biological/ agricultural sciences\nMathematics/ computer sciences Social/behavioral sciences Engineering\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nPercent\n\nNA = not available\nNOTES: Physical sciences include earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences.

An increase in foreign students results in revenue for higher education institutions. Additionally, foreign students are allowed to work in the United Kingdom for up to 12 months after graduation under certain circumstances (British Council 2007).\nAbout 100,000 foreign students studied in Japanese universities in 2005, almost 60,000 of them in S&E fields. Foreign S&E student enrollment in Japan is concentrated at the undergraduate level, accounting for 69% of all foreign S&E students. Foreign undergraduates, however, represent only 3% of all undergraduate S&E students. Although smaller in number, foreign graduate students account for 13% of graduate S&E students in Japan. About 18,000 foreign S&E graduate students were enrolled in Japanese universities in 2005, more than half of them from China (appendix table 2-46).\nForeign students are an increasing share of enrollment in Canadian universities. Foreign S&E students accounted for about 7% of undergraduate and 23% of graduate S&E enrollment in Canada in 2004, up from 5% and 22% in 1994. At both the undergraduate and graduate levels, foreign S&E students are higher percentages of students in mathematics/ computer sciences and engineering than they are in other fields. Asian countries/economies were the top places of origin of foreign S&E graduate and undergraduate students in Canada. China alone accounts for 19% of foreign S&E graduate students and 15% of foreign S&E undergraduate students in Canada. The United States is also among the top countries of origin of foreign students, accounting for 5% of foreign S&E graduate students and 10% of foreign S&E undergraduate students in Canada (appendix table 2-47).\nAustralia actively recruited foreign students in recent years. Foreign students accounted for 15% of S&E undergraduate and 32% of S&E graduate students in Australian universities in 2005 (appendix table 2-48). At both the undergraduate and graduate levels, foreign S&E students are concentrated in mathematics/computer sciences and engineering. About three quarters of foreign students (in all fields) in Australia are from Asia, mainly China and India (IIE 2007).\nInternational Comparison of Foreign Doctoral Degree Recipients\nAs in the United States, foreign students are a large share of S&E doctoral degree recipients in the United Kingdom. In 2005, 42% of S&E doctorates from the United Kingdom and 41% of S&E20 doctorates from U.S. universities were awarded to foreign students (both permanent and temporary visa holders). In both countries, foreign students accounted for more than 60% of the doctorates awarded in engineering.

Higher Education in Science and Engineering\n\nConclusion\nS&E higher education in the United States is attracting growing numbers of students. The number of bachelor's degrees and master's degrees awarded in all fields and in S&E fields continues to rise, reaching new peaks in 2005. Graduate enrollment in S&E fields is also increasing, reaching a new peak in 2005. After declining in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the number of S&E doctorates awarded increased in the past several years.\nMost of the growth in S&E education occurred in science fields. In engineering, bachelor's and master's degrees increased in recent years, but have not yet attained the levels of the 1980s. Engineering enrollment, both undergraduate and graduate, and engineering doctorates declined somewhat in recent years. Computer science enrollments and degrees followed trends similar to those of engineering.\nForeign student enrollment in graduate S&E programs dropped in recent years. The number of entering foreign students dropped after September 11, 2001, and only began to rise again in 2005. Students on temporary visas earned about one-third of S&E doctorates in the United States in 2003 and more than half of the engineering doctorates. An increasing fraction of them stay in the United States: about three-quarters of foreign doctoral degree recipients in 2003 planned to stay in the United States after graduation.\nGlobalization of higher education continues to expand. Although the United States continues to attract the largest number and fraction of foreign students worldwide, both numbers and percentages decreased in recent years. Most countries in Europe and several in Asia expanded access to higher education, resulting in increases in educational attainment since 1990. Some of the reduction in foreign students in the United States may be due to increased opportunities for students in their home countries. Some may also be due to increased competition for foreign students from other countries. Universities in several other countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and Germany, expanded their enrollment of foreign S&E students.\nNotes\n1. New efforts to develop indicators of the linkage between human capital (e.g., degrees granted, size and flows of the scientific work force) and growth in high- and medium-high technology-intensive manufacturing industries are underway (Hansen et al. 2007). Preliminary results indicate a significant correlation between doctorates awarded in natural sciences and engineering per capita population and productivity (measured by patent applications per capita population) in high and medium-high technology-intensive manufacturing industries.\n2. Physical sciences include earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences.\n3. Research institutions are classified according to the 1994 Carnegie classification. See Science and Engineering Indicators 2006 (NSB 2006) for definitions of the various classification categories.\n\n4. Financial aid is calculated for all full-time students, both in state and out of state, so net price may be underestimated.\n5. For information on debt levels of clinical versus nonclinical psychology doctorates in 1993\u00ad96, see \"Psychology Doctorate Recipients: How Much Financial Debt at Graduation?\" (NSF 00-321) at http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/issuebrf/ sib00321.htm.\n6. Based on previous projections, NCES has estimated that the mean absolute percentage error for bachelor's degrees projected 9 years out was 8.0.\n7. The number of S&E degrees awarded to a particular freshmen cohort is lower than the number of students reporting such intentions and reflects losses of students from S&E, gains of students from non-S&E fields after their freshman year, and general attrition from bachelor's degree programs. (See sidebar \"Persistence, Retention, and Attainment in Higher Education and in S&E.\")\n8. Physical sciences include earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences.\n9. Data for racial/ethnic groups are for U.S. citizens and permanent residents only.\n10. About 17% of 2001 and 2002 S&E bachelor's degree recipients had previously earned an associate's degree (NSF 2006a).\n11. Data for racial/ethnic groups are for U.S. citizens and permanent residents only.\n12. See the NSF report series Science and Engineering Degrees (http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/degrees/) for longer degree trends and Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering: 2007 (http://www.nsf. gov/statistics/women/) for more detail on enrollments and degrees by sex and by race/ethnicity.\n13. Data for racial/ethnic groups are for U.S. citizens and permanent residents only.\n14. Data for racial/ethnic groups are for U.S. citizens and permanent residents only.\n15. Data on doctorates comes from the NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates, which collects data on research doctorates only (i.e., doctorates that require original research and typically entail writing a dissertation). The survey does not collect data on professional degrees (e.g., M.D., D.D.S., J.D., Psy.D., and D.Min.). For the most recent data available, including data by detailed field and data on math and science education doctorates, see http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/ doctorates/.\n16. See the NSF report series Science and Engineering Degrees (http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/degrees/) for longer degree trends and Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering: 2007 (http://www.nsf. gov/statistics/women/) for more detail on enrollments and degrees by sex and by race/ethnicity.\n17. The number of doctoral S&E degrees earned by students in Chinese universities continued to increase throughout this period, from 125 in 1985 to 14,858 in 2004.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 2-45\n\n18. For more information about the distribution of postdoc positions according to sex, see Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering: 2007 at http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/wmpd.\n19. A first university degree refers to the completion of a terminal undergraduate degree program. These degrees are classified as level 5A in the International Standard Classification of Education, although individual countries use different names for the first terminal degree (e.g., laureata in Italy, diplome in Germany, maitrise in France, and bachelor's degree in the United States and in Asian countries).\n20. Excluding doctorates in medical/health fields.\nGlossary\nDebt burden: Student loan payments as a percent of salary. Dual enrollment courses: Classes taken on a high school campus for which a student receives course credit at both the high school and community college levels. First university degree: A terminal undergraduate degree program; these degrees are classified as level 5A in the International Standard Classification of Education, although individual countries use different names for the first terminal degree (e.g., laureata in Italy, diplome in Germany, maitrise in France, and bachelor's degree in the United States and in Asian countries). Internationally mobile students: Those individuals who are not citizens of the country in which they study. Net price: The published price of an undergraduate college education minus the average grant aid and tax benefits that students receive. Stay rate: The proportion of students on temporary visas who have plans to stay in the United States immediately after degree conferral. Tertiary type A programs: Higher education programs that are largely theory-based and designed to provide sufficient qualifications for entry to advanced research programs and to professions with high skill requirements, such as medicine, dentistry, or architecture, and have a minimum duration of 3 years, although they typically last 4 or more years. These correspond to bachelor's or master's degrees in the United States. Tertiary type B programs: Higher education programs that focus on practical, technical, or occupational skills for direct entry into the labor market and have a minimum duration of 2 years. These correspond to associate's degrees in the United States. Underrepresented minority: Blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians/Alaska Natives are considered to be underrepresented minorities in S&E.\n\nReferences\nAdelman C. 2005.

Science and Engineering Labor Force\n\nHighlights\n\nThe S&E workforce in the United States has grown rapidly for decades.\n From 1950 to 2000, employment in S&E occupations grew from fewer than 200,000 to approximately 4.8 million workers. The average annual growth rate of 6.7% contrasts with a 1.6% annual average growth rate for total employment.\n Between 1990 and 2000, S&E occupations grew at a lower average annual rate of 3.6%, but this was more than triple the rate of growth of other occupations. Different data sources suggest the same rate of employment growth in 2005.\n Between 1980 and 2000, the total number of S&E degrees earned grew at an average annual rate of 1.5%, which was faster than labor force growth, but less than the 4.2% growth of S&E occupations. The loose fit between degrees and occupations and the immigration of S&E workers helped to account for the different rates of degree and occupation growth.\nThe S&E labor force does not include just those in S&E occupations.\n Approximately 12.9 million workers said in 2003 that they needed at least a bachelor's degree level of knowledge in S&E fields in their jobs. However, in that year only 4.9 million were in occupations formally defined as S&E.\n Fifteen million workers in 2006 had an S&E degree as their highest degree and 17 million have at least one degree in an S&E field.\n Sixty-six percent of S&E degree holders in non-S&E occupations say their job is related to their degree, including many in management and marketing occupations.\n Fifty-five percent of S&E degree holders who spent at least 10% of their work hours on R&D were in non-S&E occupations.\nS&E occupations have generally recovered from unusually high unemployment in the most recent recession.\n Unemployment in S&E occupations declined to 1.6% in 2006, down from the 20-year high of 4.0% in 2003.\n Unemployment rates also declined in the S&E-related occupational categories of technicians and computer programmers to 3.1% and 2.8%, respectively, in 2006.\nChanges between 1993 and 2003 in median real salary for recent S&E graduates indicate increasing relative demand for S&E skills during the past decade.\n The mean real salary for recent S&E bachelor's degree recipients increased in all fields, averaging 15% across all fields of degree.\n\n The largest increases for recent bachelor's degree recipients were in computer and mathematical sciences (23.3%) and engineering (20.4%),\nRetirements from the S&E labor force are likely to become more significant over the next decade.\n Twenty-six percent of all S&E degree holders in the labor force are age 50 or over. Among S&E doctorate holders in the labor force, 40% are age 50 or over.\n By age 62, half of S&E bachelor's degree holders had left full-time employment. Doctoral degree holders work slightly longer, with half leaving full-time employment by age 66.\nThe importance of foreign-born scientists and engineers to the S&E enterprise in the United States continues to grow.\n Twenty-five percent of all college-educated workers in S&E occupations in 2003 were foreign born, as were 40% of doctorate holders in S&E occupations.\n At least 41% of the foreign-born university educated in the United States in 2003 had their highest degree from a foreign educational institution.\n About half of S&E doctorate holders in U.S. postdoc positions may have earned their doctorates outside of the United States.\nThe capability for doing science and technology work has increased throughout the world.\n From 1994 to 2004, R&D employment outside the United States by U.S. firms increased by 76%, compared with a 31% increase in R&D employment by the same firms in the United States, and an 18% increase in U.S. R&D employment at the U.S. subsidiaries of foreign firms.\nThe proportions of women, blacks, and Hispanics in S&E occupations have continued to grow over time, but are still less than their proportions of the population.\n Women were 12% of those in nonacademic S&E occupations in 1980 and 26% in 2005. Women are a higher proportion of nonacademic S&E occupations at the doctoral level, increasing from about 23% in 1990 to 31% in 2005.\n The proportion of blacks in nonacademic S&E occupations increased from less than 3% in 1980 to 5% in 2005. The proportion of Hispanics increased from 2% to 5% in 2005. At the doctoral level, blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians/Alaska Natives combined represented just over 4% of employment in nonacademic S&E occupations in 1990, rising to 6% in 2005.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 3-7\n\nPostdoc positions have become an increasingly important stage in the career paths of S&E doctorate recipients.\n Across all S&E fields, the proportion of U.S. S&E doctorate holders reporting ever holding a postdoc position reached 46% for the 2002\u00ad05 graduation cohort. Proportions are highest in the life sciences and the physical sciences.\n\n There has been a steady growth in the availability of employment benefits for postdocs, with 90% now reporting having medical benefits and 49% reporting retirement benefits.\n Former postdocs are moderately more likely than those with no postdoc experience to be in tenured or tenure-track positions, to have R&D as a major work activity, and to report that their job is closely related to their field of degree. However, these relationships are not necessarily causal.\n\n\f3-8 \n\nChapter 3. Science and Engineering Labor Force\n\nIntroduction\nChapter Overview\nAlthough workers with S&E skills make up only a small fraction of the total U.S. civilian labor force, their effect on society belies their numbers. These workers contribute enormously to technological innovation and economic growth, research, and increased knowledge. Workers with S&E skills include technicians and technologists, researchers, educators, and managers. In addition, many others with S&E training use their skills in a variety of nominally non-S&E occupations (such as writers, salesmen, financial managers, and legal consultants), and many niches in the labor market require them to interpret and use S&E knowledge.\nIn the last half of the last century, the size of the S&E labor force grew dramatically--with employment in S&E occupations expanding 25-fold between 1950 and 2000 (albeit from a small base of 182,000 jobs). Although the highest growth rates occurred in the 1950s, employment in S&E occupations in the 1990s continued to grow by 3 to 4 times the rate of other jobs.\nThis growth in the S&E labor force was largely made possible by three factors: (1) increases in S&E degrees earned by both native and foreign-born students, (2) both temporary and permanent migration to the United States of those with foreign S&E education, and (3) the relatively small numbers of scientists and engineers old enough to retire. Many have expressed concerns (see National Science Board 2003) that changes in any or all of these factors may limit the future growth of the S&E labor force in the United States.\nChapter Organization\nThis chapter has four major sections. The first provides a general profile of the U.S. S&E labor force. This includes demographic characteristics (population size, sex, nativity, and race/ethnicity). It also covers educational backgrounds, earnings, places of employment, occupations, and whether the S&E labor force makes use of S&E training. Much of the data in this section comes from the National Science Foundation's (NSF) 2003 surveys of S&E degree holders1--the National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG), the National Survey of Recent College Graduates (NSRCG), and the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR). When combined in a way to form a single profile of the S&E-educated population in the United States, these three surveys are known as the Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT).\nThe second section looks at the labor market conditions for recent S&E graduates, whose labor market outcomes are most sensitive to labor market conditions. For recent S&E doctoral degree recipients, the special topics of academic employment and postdoc appointments are also examined.\nThe third section examines the age and retirement profiles of the S&E labor force. This is key to gaining insights into\n\nthe possible future structure and size of the S&E-educated population.\nThe last section focuses on the global S&E labor force, both its growth abroad and the importance of the international migration of scientists and engineers to the United States and to both sending and destination countries elsewhere in the world.\nU.S. S&E Labor Force Profile\nThis section profiles the U.S. S&E labor force, providing specific information about its size, recent growth patterns, projected labor demand, and trends in sector of employment. It also looks at workers' use of their S&E training, educational background, and salaries.\nSection Overview\nThe S&E labor force includes both individuals in S&E occupations and many others with S&E training who may use their knowledge in a variety of different jobs. Employment in S&E occupations has grown rapidly over the past two decades and is currently projected to continue to grow faster than general employment through the next decade. Although most individuals with S&E degrees do not work in occupations with formal S&E titles, most of them, even at the bachelor's degree level, report doing work related to their degree even in mid- and late-career. The proportions of women and ethnic minorities in the S&E labor force continue to grow, but with the exception of Asians/Pacific Islanders, they remain smaller than their respective proportion of the overall population.\nHow Large Is the U.S. S&E Workforce?\nEstimates of the size of the U.S. S&E workforce vary based on the criteria used to define who is a scientist or an engineer. Education, occupation, field of degree, and field of employment are all factors that may be considered. (See sidebar \"Who Is a Scientist or an Engineer?\")\nEstimates of the size of the S&E workforce in 2006 ranged from approximately 5 million to more than 21 million individuals, depending on the definition and perspective used (table 3-1). In that year, 17.0 million individuals had at least one degree in an S&E field and 21.4 million had either an S&E degree or a degree in an S&E-related field such as health or technology. This broader definition of the S&E workforce may be most relevant to many of the ways science and technical knowledge is used in the United States, as S&E skills are used in a wide variety of occupations. A smaller number, 14.5 million, has an S&E degree as its highest degree.\nIf the labor force definition is limited to those in S&E occupations with at least a bachelor's degree, the 2006 NSF SESTAT data estimated 5.0 million workers, whereas the\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 3-9\n\nWho Is a Scientist or an Engineer?\n\nThe terms scientist and engineer have many definitions, none of them perfect. This chapter uses multiple definitions for different analytic purposes; other reports use even more definitions. The three main definitions used in this chapter are:\n Occupation. The most common way to count scientists and engineers in the workforce is to include individuals having an occupational classification that matches some list of S&E occupations. Although considerable questions can arise about how well individual writeins or employer classifications are coded, the occupation classification comes closest to defining the work a person performs. (For example, an engineer by occupation may or may not have an engineering degree.) One limitation of classifying by occupation is that it will not capture individuals using S&E knowledge, sometimes extensively, under occupational titles such as manager, salesman, or writer.* It is common for individuals with an S&E degree in such occupations to report that their work is closely related to their degree and, in many cases, to also report R&D as a major work activity.\n Highest degree. Another way to classify scientists and engineers is to focus on the field of their highest (or most recent) degree. For example, classifying as \"chem-\n\nist\" a person who has a bachelor's degree in chemistry but who works as a technical writer for a professional chemists' society magazine may be appropriate. Using this \"highest degree earned\" classification does not solve all problems, however. For example, should a person with a bachelor's degree in biology and a master's degree in engineering be included among biologists or engineers? Should a person with a bachelor's degree in political science be counted among social scientists if he also has a law degree? Classifying by highest degree earned in situations similar to the above examples may be appropriate, but one may be uncomfortable excluding from an analysis of the S&E labor force an individual who has both a bachelor's degree in engineering and a master's degree in business administration.\n Need for S&E knowledge. Many individuals identify their jobs as requiring at least a bachelor's degree level of knowledge in S&E, although not all of them have such a degree.\n*For example, in most collections of occupation data a generic classification of postsecondary teacher fails to properly classify many university professors who would otherwise be included by most definitions of the S&E workforce. The Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT) data partially avoid this problem through use of a different survey question, coding rules, and respondent followups.\n\nTable 3-1 Concepts and counts of S&E labor force: 2003 and 2006\n\nConcept\n\nEducation coverage\n\nSource\n\nNumber\n\nOccupation Employment in S&E occupations ....

Science and Engineering Labor Force\n\nCensus Bureau's 2005 American Community Survey estimated 3.9 million. Occupation-based estimates not limited to college graduates include 5.4 million in May 2006 from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Occupational Employment Statistics Survey (OES) and 5.3 million from the 2005 American Community Survey. OES and NSF SESTAT occupational estimates include postsecondary teachers in S&E fields, but estimates from the American Community Survey, the Current Population Survey (CPS), and the decennial census have to exclude postsecondary teachers, as no information on field is collected.\nTerminology referring to the technical labor force can be confusing. Sometimes a study will refer to the science and technology (S&T) or to the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) labor force. These terms are approximately equivalent, and as used in this chapter include all S&E occupations with the addition of technicians, programmers, technical managers, and a small number of nonhealth S&E-related occupations such as actuary and architect.

An estimated 12.9 million workers reported needing at least a bachelor's degree level of S&E knowledge, with 9.2 million reporting a need for knowledge of the natural sciences and engineering (NS&E) and 5.3 million a need for knowledge of the social sciences (1.6 million reported a need for both social science and NS&E knowledge). That the need for S&E knowledge is more than double the number in formal S&E occupations suggests the pervasiveness of the need for technical knowledge in the modern workplace.\nS&E Workforce Growth\nOccupation classifications allow examination of growth in at least one measure of scientists and engineers over extended periods (for a discussion of even longer time periods, see the sidebar \"Scientists Since Babylon\"). According to data from the decennial censuses, the number of workers in S&E occupations grew to 4.8 million, at an average annual rate between 1950 and 2000 of 6.4%, compared with a 1.6% average annual rate for the whole workforce older than age 18. By a broader definition of the S&T occupations including technicians and programmers, S&T occupations grew to 5.5 million at a 6.8% average annual rate (figures 3-1 and 3-2).\nThe growth rate of S&E employment continued to be greater than for the full workforce in the 1990s (figure 3-2). S&E employment grew between 1990 and 2000 at a 3.6%\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0 1950\n\n1960\n\n1970\n\n1980\n\n1990\n\n2000\n\nS&T = science and technology\nNOTE: Data include bachelor's degrees or higher in science occupations, some college and above in engineering occupations, and any education level for technicians and computer programmers.\nSOURCE: Adapted from Lowell BL, Regets MC, A Half-Century Snapshot of the STEM Workforce, 1950 to 2000, Commission on Professionals in Science and Technology (2006).\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nFigure 3-2 Average annual growth rates of S&E occupations versus all workers: 1960\u00ad2000\n\nPercent 6\n5\n\nS&E total\n\nAll workers 18 years old\n\nGrowth rate ratios\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0 1960\u00ad70\n\n1970\u00ad80\n\n1980\u00ad90\n\n1990\u00ad2000\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science of Science Resources Statistics, decennial census data, special tabulations.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 3-11\n\nScientists Since Babylon\n\nIn the early 1960s a prominent historian of science, Derek J. de Solla Price, examined the growth of science and the number of scientists over very long periods in history, titling one book Science Since Babylon (1961). Using a number of empirical measures (most over at least 300 years), Price found that science, and the number of scientists, tended to double about every 15 years, with measures of higher-quality science and scientists tending to grow slower (doubling every 20 years) and measures of lowerquality science and scientists faster (every 10 years).\nOne implication of this long-term exponential growth often cited in popular science writing is that \"80 to 90 percent of all the scientists that ever lived are alive today\" (Price 1961). This insight follows from the likelihood that most of the last 45 years' (a period of three doublings) production of new scientists would still be alive. Price was interested in many implications of these growth patterns, but in particular the idea that this growth could not continue indefinitely and that the number of scientists would reach \"saturation.\" Not everyone is either capable of becoming, or wants to become, a scientist, and society will always need people to perform other jobs. Even if no other limits applied, the number of scientists could not exceed the size of the population. Although not predicting exactly when growth in the number of scientists would slow, Price was concerned (in 1961) that saturation had already begun.\nHow different are the growth rates in the number of scientists and engineers in recent periods from what Price estimated for past centuries? A doubling every 10 years would imply an annual average growth rate of 7.1%; every 15 years an average annual rate of 4.7%; and every\n\n20 years an annual average growth rate of 3.5%. Table 3-2 shows growth rates for some measurements of the S&E labor force in the United States and elsewhere in the world for a period of available data. Of these measures, the number of S&E doctorate holders in the United States labor force showed the lowest average annual growth of 3.0% (doubling in 24 years if this growth rate were to continue). The number of doctorate holders employed in S&E occupations in the United States showed faster average annual growth of 4.6% (doubling in 16 years if continued). There are no global counts of individuals in S&E, but the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) does count \"researchers\" in the developed countries that are OECD members. In the OECD countries, the number of researchers grew at an average annual rate of 3.4% (21 years to double). Very limited data exists on the population of scientists and engineers in most developing countries, but OECD data for researchers in China show a 7.4% average annual grow rate (10 years to double).\nAll of these numbers are broadly consistent with a continuation of growth in S&E labor exceeding the rate of growth in the general labor force, both in the United States and in the world as a whole. Because none of the measures are the same as those used by Price, it is impossible to say that there has been a slowing in growth. What about the ultimate limit to growth for scientists and engineers in the United States? If the 1990s growth rates shown in figure 3-2 for the number employed in S&E occupations and for the total labor force were to continue indefinitely, all U.S. workers in 2135 would be in S&E occupations.\n\nTable 3-2 Growth rates for selected S&E labor force measurements\n\nMeasurement\n\nSource\n\nYears\n\nFirst year\n\nLast year\n\nAverage annual growth rate (%)\n\nResearchers in OECD countries..............................................

Although the growth rate for S&E occupations was somewhat less in the 1990s than in the 1980s, it actually increased relative to the growth of all workers.\nIn all broad categories of S&E fields, employment in the occupations directly associated with the category has grown faster than new degree production (see chapter 2 for a fuller discussion of S&E degrees). Average annual growth rates of employment and degree production are shown in figure 3-3 for 1980\u00ad2000. Although S&E employment grew at an average annual rate of 4.2%, total S&E degree production grew by a smaller 1.5%. With the exception of the social sciences, there was greater growth in the number of graduate degrees in each field, with total S&E master's degrees granted growing at an average annual rate of 2.0% and doctoral degrees at 1.9%.\nUsing data from the monthly CPS from 1983 to 2006 to look at employment in S&E occupations across all sectors and education levels creates a very similar view, albeit with some significant differences. The 3.1% average annual growth rate in all S&E employment is almost triple the rate for the general workforce. This is reflected in the growing proportion of total jobs in S&E occupations, which increased from 2.6% in 1983 to 4.2% in 2006. Also noteworthy are the decreases in employment in S&E occupations in 1992 and again in 2002, evidence that S&E employment is not exempt from economic downturns (figure 3-4).\nProjected Demand for S&E Workers The most recent occupational projections from BLS, for\n2004\u00ad14, forecast that total employment in occupations that NSF classifies as S&E will increase at nearly double the overall growth rate for all occupations (figure 3-5). These projections involve only the demand for strictly defined S&E occupations and do not include the wider range of jobs in which S&E degree holders often use their training.\n\nFigure 3-4 U.S. workforce in S&E occupations: 1983\u00ad2006\n\nS&E employees (millions) (bars) 7\n\nWorkforce (%) (line) 4.5\n\n6\n\n4.0\n\n3.5 5\n3.0\n\n4\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n2.0\n\n1.5 2\n1.0\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1983 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, special tabulations from Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Population Survey Monthly Outgoing Rotation files (1983\u00ad2006).\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nS&E occupations are projected to grow by 26% from 2004 to 2014, while employment in all occupations is projected to grow 13% over the same period (BLS 2006).2 However, S&E occupations may be particularly difficult to forecast. Many spending decisions on R&D by corporations and governments are difficult or impossible to anticipate. In addition, R&D money increasingly crosses borders in search of the best place to have particular research performed. (The United States may be a net recipient of these R&D funds; see discussion in chapter 4.) Finally, it may be difficult to anticipate new products and industries that may be created via the innovation processes that are most closely associated with scientists and engineers.\n\nFigure 3-3 Annual average growth rate of degree production and occupational employment, by S&E field: 1980\u00ad2000\n\nPercent\n10 Bachelor's\n8\n\nMaster's\n\nDoctorate\n\nAll degrees\n\nEmployment in occupation\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0 All S&E\n\u00ad2 \u00ad4\n\nEngineering\n\nLife sciences\n\nMathematics/ computer sciences\n\nPhysical sciences\n\nSocial sciences\n\nSOURCES: Census Bureau, Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), 1980\u00ad2000; and National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, data on degree production and special tabulations.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 3-13\n\nFigure 3-5 Projected increase in employment, for S&E and selected other occupations: 2004\u00ad14\nPercent\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nComputer/ Post-\n\nHealth\n\nmathematical secondary practitioners/\n\nscientists teachers technicians\n\nAll S&E\n\nLife\n\nS&E\n\nSocial Engineers\n\nAll\n\nS&E\n\nPhysical\n\nscientists managers scientists\n\noccupations technicians scientists\n\nSOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Office of Occupational Statistics and Employment Projections. See appendix table 3-7. Science and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nApproximately 73% of BLS's projected increase in S&E jobs is in computer-related occupations (table 3-3). Aside from computer-related occupations, life scientists, social scientists, and engineers all have projected growth rates above those for all occupations.3 An occupation of interest to the S&E labor market, \"postsecondary teacher\" (which includes all fields of instruction), is projected to grow almost as fast as computer occupations, rising from 1.8 to 2.3 million over the decade between 2004 and 2014.\n\nBLS also forecasts that job openings in NSF's list of S&E occupations over the 2004\u00ad14 period will be a slightly greater proportion of current employment than for all occupations: 42% versus 38% (figure 3-6). Job openings include both growth in total employment and openings caused by attrition. One big reason that S&E job openings are not much higher than average job growth is retirements (see the discussion later in this chapter). Although retirements in S&E may be expected to increase rapidly in coming years and increase in percentage terms faster than retirements from other\n\nTable 3-3 S&E employment and job openings, by occupation: 2004 and projected 2014\n(Thousands)\n\nOccupation\n\n2004\n\n2014\n\nChange\n\nJob openings\n\n10-year total growth (%)\n\n10-year job openings as\npercent of 2004 employment\n\nAll occupations............................................................... 145,612 164,540 18,928\n\n54,680\n\n13.0\n\n37.5\n\nAll S&E ........................................................................ 5,120 6,440 1,319\n\n2,186\n\n25.8\n\n42.7\n\nComputer/mathematical scientists ......................... 2,698 3,656\n\n958\n\n1,273\n\n35.5\n\n47.2\n\nEngineers ................................................................ 1,449 1,644\n\n195\n\n507\n\n13.4\n\n35.0\n\nLife scientists ..........................................................\n\n232\n\n280\n\n48\n\n103\n\n20.8\n\n44.6\n\nPhysical scientists ...................................................\n\n250\n\n281\n\n30\n\n94\n\n12.2\n\n37.4\n\nSocial scientists/related occupations .....................\n\n492\n\n580\n\n88\n\n209\n\n17.9\n\n42.5\n\nSelected other occupations\n\nS&E managers.........................................................\n\n513\n\n616\n\n103\n\n200\n\n20.1\n\n39.0\n\nS&E technicians ......................................................\n\n874\n\n986\n\n112\n\n303\n\n12.8\n\n34.7\n\nPostsecondary teachers/administrators ................. 1,760 2,312\n\n553\n\n953\n\n31.4\n\n54.1\n\nComputer programmers..........................................\n\n455\n\n464\n\n9\n\n117\n\n2.0\n\n25.6\n\nHealthcare practitioner/technical occupations ....... 6,805 8,561 1,756\n\n3,047\n\n25.8\n\n44.8\n\nNOTE: Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) does not make projection for S&E occupations as a group; numbers in table based on sum of BLS projections in those occupations that National Science Foundation considers S&E.\n\nSOURCE: BLS, Office of Occupational Statistics and Employment Projections, National Industry-Occupation Employment Projections 2004\u00ad14 (2005).\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\f3-14 \n\nChapter 3.

Retirement is also the likely reason that S&E job openings are less dominated by computer-related occupations, which have younger age distributions than other S&E areas.\nSalary Changes as an Indicator of Labor Market Conditions\nSometimes discussions of S&E labor markets use difficultto-define words like \"surplus\" or \"shortage\" that imply a close matching between particular types of educational credentials or skill sets and particular jobs. As discussed previously in this chapter, individuals with a particular S&E degree may\n\nuse their training in occupations nominally associated with different S&E fields or in occupations not considered S&E. They may also work in various sectors of employment such as private industry, academia, government, or K\u00ad12 education. All of this makes any \"simple\" comparison between projections of labor supply and market demand impossible.\nOne indicator of the level of labor market demand, compared with the supply of individuals with those skills, is the changes observed over time in the pay received by individuals with similar sets of skills.4 The changes between 1993 and 2003 in real (inflation-adjusted) mean salary for recent graduates in S&E fields are shown in figure 3-7 and actual means for 2003 in figure 3-8. On average real mean earnings increased for recent S&E bachelor's degree graduates\n\nFigure 3-7 Inflation-adjusted change in mean salary 1\u00ad5 years after degree, by field and level of highest degree: 1993\u00ad2003\n\nPercent growth\n\n40\n\nBachelor's\n\nMaster's\n\nDoctorate\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0 Engineering\n\nLife sciences\n\nMathematics/ computer sciences\n\nPhysical sciences\n\nSocial sciences\n\nAll S&E\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), 1993 and 2003, http://sestat.nsf.gov.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 3-15\n\nFigure 3-8 Mean salaries of S&E and S&E-related degree recipients 1\u00ad5 years after degree, by field and level of highest degree: 2003\n\nDollars (thousands)\n\n80\n\nBachelor's\n\nMaster's\n\nDoctorate\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0 Engineering\n\nLife sciences\n\nMathematics/computer sciences Physical sciences\n\nSocial sciences\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation.

Recent engineering bachelor's recipients showed the second highest real growth in salary of 20%.\nAmong recent S&E master's degree recipients, real mean salaries increased 12%, ranging from 3% in the social sciences to 24% in engineering.\nAmong recent doctoral degree recipients, the increase in median real salary was greatest for those in the physical sciences and mathematical and computer science (each 20%) and smallest was in the life sciences (8%). Evaluation of recent doctoral degree recipient salaries is made more difficult by the earnings differentials between academic and nonacademic employment, as well as the increasing prevalence of lower-paying postdoc positions.\nSalaries Over a Person's Working Life\nEstimates of median salary at different points in a person's working life are shown in figure 3-9 for individuals with bachelor's degrees in a variety of fields. After the first 4 years, holders of S&E bachelor's degrees earn more than those with non-S&E degrees at every year since degree. Median salaries for S&E bachelor's degree holders in 2003 peaked at $65,000 at 15\u00ad19 years after degree, compared with $49,000 for those with non-S&E bachelor's degrees. Median salaries of individuals with bachelor's degrees in S&E-related fields (such as technology, architecture, or health) peaked at $52,000 at 25\u00ad29 years after degree-- much less than for S&E graduates but higher than for nonS&E bachelor's holders at most years since degree.\n\nFigure 3-9 Median salaries for bachelor's degree holders, by years since degree: 2003\nDollars (thousands) 70\nS&E\n60\nS&E related 50\nNon-S&E\n40\n\n30\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n0 1\u00ad4\n\n5\u00ad9 10\u00ad14 15\u00ad19 20\u00ad24 25\u00ad29 30\u00ad34 Years since degree\n\nNOTE: S&E related defined within National Science Foundation's labor force surveys as including technician and health fields, as well as some smaller fields such as actuarial science.\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, National Survey of College Graduates, 2003.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\f3-16 \n\nChapter 3.

In 2003, of the 6.0 million individuals whose highest degree was in an S&E field and who did not work in S&E occupations, 66% indicated that they worked in a job either closely or somewhat related to the field of their highest S&E degree (table 3-4).\nOne to four years after receiving their degrees, 96% of S&E doctoral degree holders say that they have jobs closely or somewhat related to the degrees they received, compared with 91% of master's degree recipients and 73% of bachelor's degree recipients (figure 3-10). This relative ordering of relatedness by level of degree holds across all periods of years since recipients received their degrees. However, at every degree level, the relatedness of job to degree tends to fall with time since receipt of degree, with some exceptions for older workers, who may be more likely to still work when their jobs are related to their education. There are many good reasons for this trend: individuals may change their career interests over time, gain skills in different areas while working, take on general management responsibilities, or forget some of their original college training (or some of their original college training may become obsolete). Given these possibilities, the career-cycle decline in the relevance of an S&E degree is only modest.\nEven when a stricter criterion (\"closely related\") is used for the fit between an individual's job and field of degree, the data indicate that many recent bachelor's degree recipients work in jobs that use skills developed during their college S&E training (figure 3-11). In natural science and engineering fields, about half of individuals from 1 to 4 years after graduation characterized their jobs as closely related to their field of degree. Among the major disciplines in this group, the proportion of bachelor's degree holders reporting a close relationship between their job and their college major was highest in engineering (59%), followed by computer and mathematical sciences (57%), physical sciences (54%), and\n\nFigure 3-10 Individuals with highest degree in S&E employed in jobs closely or somewhat related to highest degree, by years since highest degree: 2003\nPercent\n100\nDoctorate\n\n80 Bachelor's\n\nMaster's\n\n60\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n0 1\u00ad4 5\u00ad9 10\u00ad14 15\u00ad19 20\u00ad24 25\u00ad29 30\u00ad34 35+\nYears since degree\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), 2003, http://sestat.nsf.gov.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nlife sciences (48%). The comparable figure for social science graduates (28%) was substantially lower. According to this stricter definition of relatedness of job and degree, as with relatedness in general, relatedness declines only slowly with years since degree.\nEmployment in Non-S&E Occupations About 6.0 million individuals whose highest degree is\nin S&E worked in non-S&E occupations in 2003. Of these, two-thirds said that their job was at least somewhat related to their degree (table 3-5). This included 1.6 million in management and management-related occupations, of whom\n\nTable 3-4 Individuals with highest degree in S&E employed in non-S&E occupations, by highest degree and relation of degree to job: 2003\n(Percent)\n\nDegree related to job\n\nHighest degree\n\nn (thousands)\n\nClosely\n\nSomewhat\n\nNot\n\nAll degree levelsa ................................................

In the next largest occupation category for S&E-degreed individuals in non-S&E jobs, sales and marketing, slightly over half (51%) said their S&E degrees were at least somewhat relevant to their jobs. Among K\u00ad12 teachers whose highest degree is in S&E, 78% say their job is closely related to their degrees.\nUnemployment A more than two-decades-long view of unemployment\ntrends in S&E occupations, regardless of education level, comes from the CPS data for 1983\u00ad2006. Unemployment of college degree holders in S&E occupations fell to 1.6% in 2006, reflecting a recovery from employment difficulties earlier in the decade. This compares to a 4.6% unemployment rate for all workers in 2006 and a 2.2% unemployment rate for other college graduates. Unemployment rates also declined in the S&E-related occupational categories of technicians and computer programmers (not limited by education level) to 3.1% and 2.8%, respectively.\nDuring this 22-year period, the unemployment rate for all individuals in S&E occupations ranged from a low of 1.3% in 1997 and 1998 to a high of 4.0% in 2003. Overall, the S&E occupational unemployment rate was both lower and less volatile than either the rate for all U.S. workers (ranging from 3.9% to 9.9%), for all workers with a bachelor's degree or higher (ranging from 1.8% to 7.8%), or for S&E technicians (ranging from 2.0% to 6.1%). During most of the period, computer programmers had an unemployment rate similar to that of S&E occupations, but greater volatility (ranging from\n\nTable 3-5 Individuals with highest degree in S&E employed in non-S&E occupations, by occupation and relation of degree to job: 2003\n(Percent)\n\nDegree related to job\n\nOccupation\n\nn (thousands)\n\nClosely\n\nSomewhat\n\nNot\n\nAll non-S&E .........................................................

The most recent recession (in 2001) appears to have had a strong effect on S&E employment, with the differential between S&E and general unemployment falling to only 1.9 percentage points in 2002, compared with 6.9 percentage points in 1983 (figure 3-12). During 2002 and 2003, unemployment of college graduates in S&E occupations rose above that of other college graduates by 0.8 percentage points in each year. This may have been because of the unusually strong reductions in R&D in the information and related technology sectors (see chapter 4).\nFigure 3-13 compares unemployment rates over career cycles for bachelor's and doctoral degree holders in 1999 and in 2003. Looking at field of degree rather than occupation includes individuals who might have left an S&E occupation for negative economic reasons in addition to the larger portion of the S&E labor force who have other occupational titles. The generally weaker 2003 labor market had its greatest effect on bachelor's degree holders: for individuals at various points in their careers, the unemployment rate increased by between 1.6 and 3.5 percentage points between 1999 and 2003. Although labor market conditions had a lesser effect on doctoral degree holders' unemployment rates, some increases in unemployment rates between 1999 and 2003 did occur for those individuals in most years-since-degree groups.\n\nSimilarly, labor market conditions from 1999 to 2003 had a greater effect on the proportion of bachelor's degree holders than on doctoral degree holders who said they were working involuntarily out of the field (IOF) of their highest degree (figure 3-14). For doctoral degree holders, IOF rates changed little between 1999 and 2003. IOF rates actually dropped for recent doctoral degree graduates, while increasing slightly for those later in their careers. However, in both 1999 and 2003, the oldest doctoral degree holders actually had the lowest IOF rates, which may partially reflect lower retirement rates for individuals working in their fields. Taken together with the unemployment patterns shown in figure 3-13, this finding implies that more highly educated S&E workers are less vulnerable to changes in economic conditions than individuals who hold only bachelor's degrees.\nS&E Employment From Occupational Employment Statistics Survey\nEstimates of employment in S&E occupations in the United States from the OES survey of employers reached 5.4 million in May 2006 (table 3-6). This was up 6.3% from May 2004 (a 3.1% average annual rate) and exceeded the 1.7% average annual increase in employment in all occupations.\n\nFigure 3-12 Unemployment rate, by occupation: 1983\u00ad2006\n\nPercent\n\n10\n\nAll U.S. workers\n\nBachelor's degree\n\nS&E technicians\n\n8\n\nComputer programmers\n\nAll S&E occupations\n\n6\n\n4\n\nFigure 3-13 Unemployment rates for individuals with highest degree in S&E, by years since highest degree: 1999 and 2003\nPercent 8\n6\nBachelor's 2003 4\n\n2\n0 1983 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 SOURCE: National Bureau of Economic Research, Merged Outgoing Rotation Group Files; Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Population Survey.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nDoctorate 2003 2\n\nBachelor's 1999\n\nDoctorate 1999\n\n0 1\u00ad4 5\u00ad9 10\u00ad14 15\u00ad19 20\u00ad24 25\u00ad29 30\u00ad34 35+\nYears since degree\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), 1999 and 2003, http://sestat.nsf.gov.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nFigure 3-14 Involuntarily out-of-field rates of individuals with highest degree in S&E, by years since highest degree: 1999 and 2003\nPercent 14\n12\nBachelor's 2003 10\n8\nBachelor's 1999 6\nDoctorate 2003 4\n2 Doctorate 1999\n0 1\u00ad4 5\u00ad9 10\u00ad14 15\u00ad19 20\u00ad24 25\u00ad29 30\u00ad34 35+\nYears since degree SOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), 1999 and 2003, http://sestat.nsf.gov.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nTable 3-6\nEmployment and employment growth in science and technology and related occupations: May 2004\u00adMay 2006\n\nOccupation\n\n2006 occupation\ntotal (n)\n\nAverage annual growth rate (%)\n\nAll U.S. employment....................... 132,604,980 1.7 Science and technology occupations................................ 7,441,780 1.9 S&E occupations..................... 5,407,710 3.1 Social scientists................... 536,880 5.4 Physical scientists ............... 291,380 3.2 Mathematical/computer scientists............................ 2,743,560 3.4 Life scientists....................... 291,980 3.2 Engineers............................. 1,543,900 1.9 Technology occupations ......... 2,034,070 \u00ad1.0 Technicians/programmers .... 1,560,250 \u00ad0.7 Technical managers............. 473,820 \u00ad2.1 Other S&E-related occupations (not included above).................. 7,317,320 2.9 Healthcare practitioner/ technical workers .................. 7,160,310 2.8 Other ....................................... 157,010 4.4\n\nSOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Employment Statistics Survey, May 2004 and May 2006.

These broader definitions usually include technicians, computer programmers, and technical managers, along with those occupations that NSF considers to be S&E. The broader aggregate may thus be thought of as S&E occupations plus individuals who directly manage S&E activities and the technical workers who support those in S&E occupations. Total employment in this broader set of S&T occupations was 7.4 million in May 2006. The distribution of employment across S&T occupations is shown in figure 3-15. In contrast to S&E occupations, S&T employment grew only slightly faster than the labor market as a whole (1.9% versus 1.7% average annual growth) because of a declining number of technicians and programmers as well as technical managers.\nA number of occupations may be considered related to this broader set of S&T occupations. They include healthcare occupations and a number of technical occupations such as actuary and architect. Overall, the more than 7 million people in these additional occupations increased by an average annual rate of 2.9%.\nAnnual Earnings From OES Data\nMedian annual earnings (regardless of education) in S&E occupations were $67,780, more than double the median ($30,400) for all occupations (table 3-7). The spread in average (mean) earnings was less dramatic but still quite wide, with individuals in S&E occupations earning considerably more on average than workers in all occupations: $71,150 versus $39,190 for all occupations. Average earnings ranged from a mean of $64,570 for social science occupations to $77,910 for engineering occupations.

Technicians and programmers experienced a slower than average 2.6% average annual growth in earnings.\nMetropolitan Areas\nUnited States metropolitan areas are ranked in table 3-8 according to the proportion of the entire metropolitan area workforce that is employed in S&E occupations, and in table 3-9 by the total number of workers employed in S&E occupations. The Boulder-Longmont, Colorado, metropolitan area had the highest percentage of its workforce employed in S&E occupations in May 2006, at 14.3%. The New York metropolitan area has the greatest total number of individuals employed in S&E occupations at 309,000, while having a slightly below average 3.8% of workers in S&E occupations. Although the top-20 list for proportion of S&E employment consists mainly of smaller and perhaps less economically diverse metropolitan areas, Washington, DC, Seattle, Boston, San Francisco, and San Jose appear in both top-20 lists.\nS&E Occupation Density by Industry\nIndividuals in S&E occupations are not just employed by \"high-technology\" employers. S&E knowledge is necessary in a variety of different industries, and as shown in table 3-10, workers with such knowledge are found in industries\n\nwith very different percentages of S&E occupations as a portion of total employment. More than 1 million in S&E occupations are employed in industries with less than the average 4% of S&E occupations. These industries, with a below average density of S&E occupations, employ 75% of all workers and 19% of all workers in S&E occupations. Industries with a low density of S&E occupations include a wide variety of activities, such as local government (2.9% with 158,000 in S&E occupations), hospitals (1.3% with 63,000 in S&E occupations), and plastic parts manufacturing (2.4% with 15,000 in S&E occupations).\nIn general, industries with higher proportions of individuals in S&E occupations pay higher average salaries to both S&E and non-S&E workers. The average salary of workers in non-S&E occupations who are in industries with more than 40% S&E occupations is nearly double the average salary of workers in non-S&E occupations in industries with below average density of S&E occupations ($68,600 versus $34,600).\nEmployment Sectors\nIndustry is the largest provider of employment for individuals with S&E degrees (figure 3-16), employing 59% of all individuals whose highest degree is in S&E, including 33% of S&E doctoral degree holders. Four-year colleges and universities are an important but not majority employer for S&E doctoral degree holders (44%). This 44% includes a variety of employment types other than the tenured and tenuretrack employment that is still sometimes referred to as the \"traditional\" doctoral career path, including many younger doctorate holders in postdoc positions and other temporary employment situations, as well as individuals with a variety of research and administrative functions.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 3-21\n\nTable 3-8\nTop-ranked metropolitan areas for employment in S&E occupations, by S&E percentage of total employment: 2006\n\nRank Metropolitan area\n\nS&E\n\nWorkforce employees\n\n(%)\n\n(n)\n\nna United States........................... 4.1 1 Boulder, CO ............................. 14.3 2 San Jose-SunnyvaleSanta Clara, CA..................... 14.1 3 Huntsville, AL........................... 12.2 4 Durham, NC............................. 10.7 5 Corvallis, OR............................ 10.7 6 Washington-ArlingtonAlexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV... 10.5 7 Kennewick-RichlandPasco, WA ............................. 9.3 8 Ames, IA .................................. 8.4 9 Palm Bay-MelbourneTitusville, FL........................... 7.9\n10 Olympia, WA............................ 7.9 11 Austin-Round Rock, TX........... 7.9 12 Seattle-Tacoma-\nBellevue, WA ......................... 7.8 13 Ann Arbor, MI........................... 7.6 14 Boston-Cambridge-\nQuincy, MA-NH ..................... 7.4 15 Portsmouth, NH-ME................ 7.3 16 Colorado Springs, CO ............. 7.0 17 Fort Walton Beach-\nCrestview-Destin, FL ............. 6.9 18 Madison, WI ............................ 6.9 19 Raleigh-Cary, NC..................... 6.9 20 San Francisco-Oakland-\nFremont, CA .......................... 6.9\n\n5,407,710 22,520\n126,090 24,030 27,770 4,150\n297,670\n7,880 3,440\n16,490 7,440\n56,100\n127,070 14,950\n180,110 4,140\n17,610\n5,970 22,640 32,920\n137,150\n\nna = not applicable\n\nSOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Employment Statistics Survey, May 2006.

Government and educational services sectors each had less than 11% of total employment in S&E occupations in 2006. The largest sector of employment for S&E occupations was \"professional, scientific, and technical services\" with 28%, followed by manufacturing with 17%.\nEmployer Size\nSmall firms are important employers of scientists and engineers, particularly at the doctoral degree level. For individuals whose highest degree is in S&E and who are employed in business/industry, the distribution of employer size is shown in figure 3-18. Across all degree levels, 37% of S&E degree holders are employed in companies with fewer than 100 employees. In general, there is a similar pattern of employment across employer size by degree levels, but\n\nTable 3-9\nTop-ranked metropolitan areas for employment in S&E occupations, by total number of individuals employed in S&E occupations: 2006\n\nRank Metropolitan area\n\nS&E\n\nemployees Workforce\n\n(n)\n\n(%)\n\nna United States........................... 5,407,710 4.1 1 New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-PA............................... 308,860 3.8 2 Washington-ArlingtonAlexandria, DC-VAMD-WV .................................. 297,670 10.5 3 Los Angeles-Long BeachSanta Ana, CA ....................... 231,900 4.1 4 Boston-Cambridge-Quincy, MA-NH................................... 180,110 7.4 5 Chicago-Naperville-Joilet, IL-IN-WI ................................. 179,560 4.1 6 Dallas-Fort WorthArlington, TX .......................... 140,140 5.0 7 San Francisco-OaklandFremont, CA .......................... 137,150 6.9 8 Philadelphia-CamdenWilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD.... 134,980 4.9 9 Detroit-Warren-Livonia, MI ...... 128,430 6.4\n10 Seattle-TacomaBellevue, WA.......................... 127,070 7.8\n11 San Jose-SunnyvaleSanta Clara, CA ..................... 126,090 14.1\n12 Houston-Sugar LandBaytown, TX .......................... 117,310 4.9\n13 Atlanta-Sandy SpringsMarietta, GA .......................... 100,560 4.3\n14 Minneapolis-St. PaulBloomington, MN-WI............. 100,540 5.7\n15 San Diego-CarlsbadSan Marcos, CA..................... 76,830 5.9\n16 Denver-Aurora, CO .................. 75,690 6.3 17 Phoenix-Mesa-\nScottsdale, AZ ....................... 70,070 3.8 18 Baltimore-Towson, MD............ 67,930 5.3 19 Miami-Fort Lauderdale-\nMiami Beach, FL.................... 65,940 2.8 20 St. Louis, MO-IL ...................... 56,520 4.3\n\nna = not applicable\n\nNOTE: Values for New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NYNJ-PA are for 2005.\n\nSOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational Employment Statistics Survey, May 2006.

Conversely, although 18% of S&E bachelor's degree holders in business and industry are employed in firms with fewer than 10 employees, this figure is 19% at the master's degree and 24% at the doctoral degree level.\nEducational Distribution of S&E Workers\nDiscussions of the S&E workforce often focus on individuals who hold doctoral degrees. However, American Community Survey data on the educational achievement of individuals working in S&E occupations outside academia in 2005 indicate that only 7% had doctorates (figure 3-19). In 2005, about two-thirds of individuals working in nonacademic S&E occupations had bachelor's degrees (44%) or master's degrees (21%).5 Slightly more than one-quarter of individuals working in S&E occupations had not earned a bachelor's degree.\nAlthough technical issues of occupational classification may inflate the estimate of the size of the nonbaccalaureate S&E workforce, it is also true that many individuals who have not earned a bachelor's degree enter the labor force with marketable technical skills from technical or vocational school training (with or without earned associate's degrees), college courses, and on-the-job training. In information technology (IT), and to some extent in other occupations, employers frequently use certification exams, not formal degrees, to judge skills. (See sidebar \"Who Performs R&D?\" and discussion in chapter 2.)\n\nFigure 3-19 Educational distribution, by nonacademic S&E occupations: 2005\n\nDoctorate 7% Professional 1%\n\nHigh school <1% High school graduate/GED 5%\nSome college, no degree 13%\n\nMaster's 21%\n\nAssociate's\u00ad academic 8%\n\nBachelor's 44%\nGED = General Equivalency Diploma SOURCE: Census Bureau, American Community Survey, 2005.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\f3-24 \n\nChapter 3. Science and Engineering Labor Force\n\nWho Performs R&D?\n\nAlthough individuals with S&E degrees use their acquired knowledge in various ways (e.g., teaching, writing, evaluating, and testing), R&D is of particular importance to both the economy and the advancement of knowledge. Figure 3-20 shows the distribution of individuals with S&E degrees who report R&D as a major work activity (defined as the activity involving the greatest, or second greatest, number of work hours from a list of 22 possible work activities), by level of degree. Individuals with doctoral degrees constitute only 6% of all individuals with S&E degrees but represent 9% of individuals who report R&D as a major work activity. However, the majority of S&E degree holders who report R&D as a major work activity have only bachelor's degrees (59%). An additional 28% have master's degrees and 4% have professional degrees, mostly in medicine. Figure 3-21 shows the distribution of individuals with S&E degrees who reported R&D as a major work activity, by field of highest degree. Individuals with engineering degrees constitute more than one-third (36%) of the total.\nIndividuals who are in non-S&E occupations do much R&D. Table 3-11 shows the occupational distribution of S&E degree holders who report R&D as a major work activity, as well as those reporting that at least 10% of their time involves R&D. Forty percent of those for whom R&D is a major work activity are in non-S&E occupations (and two-thirds of these are also outside of the occupations that NSF classifies as \"S&E related\"). Among those S&E degree holders whose jobs involve at least 10% R&D, 55% are in non-S&E occupations.\nFigure 3-22 shows the percentages of S&E doctoral degree holders reporting R&D as a major work activity by field of degree and by years since receipt of doctorate. Individuals working in physical sciences and engineering report the highest R&D rates over their career cycles, with the lowest R&D rates in social sciences. Although the percentage of doctoral degree holders engaged in R&D activities declines as time since receipt of degree increases, it remains greater than 50% in all fields except social sciences for all years since receipt of degree. The decline may reflect movement into management or other career interests. It may also reflect, even within nonmanagement positions, increased opportunity and the ability of more experienced scientists to perform functions involving the interpretation and use of, as opposed to the creation of, scientific knowledge.\n\nFigure 3-20 Distribution of S&E degree holders with R&D as major work activity, by level of education: 2003\nDoctorate 9.0%\nProfessional 4.4%\n\nMaster's 28.2%\n\nBachelor's 58.5%\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), 2003, http://sestat.nsf.gov.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nFigure 3-21 Distribution of S&E degree holders with R&D as major work activity, by field of highest degree: 2003\n\nSocial sciences 20%\n\nEngineering 36%\n\nPhysical sciences\n10%\n\nMathematics/ computer\nsciences 17%\n\nLife sciences 16%\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), 2003, http://sestat.nsf.gov.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nTable 3-11 Occupations of S&E degree holders with R&D work activities: 2003\n(Percent)\n\nOccupation\n\nR&D as R&D at major work least 10%\nactivity of work time\n\nS&E occupations ............................. 60.5\n\n45.0\n\nEngineering occupations ............. 24.4\n\n17.7\n\nLife sciences ................................ 7.9\n\n5.1\n\nMathematics/computer\n\nscience occupations.................. 18.1\n\n14.8\n\nPhysical science occupations ..... 5.5\n\n3.7\n\nSocial science occupations ......... 4.8\n\n3.8\n\nNon-S&E occupations..................... 39.5\n\n55.0\n\nS&E-related occupations ............. 13.2\n\n15.1\n\nOther non-S&E occupations........ 26.3\n\n39.9\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), 2003, http://sestat.nsf.gov.\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nFigure 3-22 S&E doctorate holders with R&D as major work activity, by field and years since degree: 2003\nPercent\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n20\n0 1\u00ad4\n\nAll S&E Engineering Life sciences Mathematics/computer sciences Physical sciences Social sciences\n5\u00ad9 10\u00ad14 15\u00ad19 20\u00ad24 25\u00ad29 30\u00ad34 35+ Years since degree\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), 2003, http://sestat.nsf.gov.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 3-25\n\nSalaries\nFigure 3-23 illustrates the distribution of salaries earned by individuals with S&E degrees. Education produces far more dramatic effects on the \"tails\" of the distribution (the proportion with either very high or very low earnings) than on median earnings. In 2003, 11% of S&E bachelor's degree holders had salaries higher than $100,000, compared with 28% of doctoral degree holders. Similarly, 22% of bachelor's degree holders earned less than $30,000, compared with 8% of doctoral degree holders. The latter figure reflects the inclusion of postdoc appointees. (The Survey of Doctorate Recipients defines postdoc appointments as a temporary position awarded in academia, industry, or government for the primary purpose of receiving additional research training.)\nA cross-sectional profile of median 2003 salaries for S&E degree holders over the course of their career is shown in figure 3-24. As is usual in such profiles, median earnings generally increase with time since degree, as workers add on-the-job knowledge to the formal training they received in school. Also usual is to find averages of earnings begin to decline in mid-to-late career, as is shown here for holders of bachelor's and master's degrees in S&E, which is a common pattern often attributed to \"skill depreciation.\" In contrast, the profile of S&E doctoral degree holders' earnings continues to rise even late in their careers. Median salaries peak at $65,000 for bachelor's holders, $73,000 for master's degree holders, and at $96,000 for doctoral degree holders.\n\nFigure 3-23 Salary distribution of S&E degree holders employed full time, by degree level: 2003\nDensity (percent)\n0.000014\n\n0.000012 0.000010\n\nBachelor's\n\nMaster's\n\nDoctorate\n\n0.000008\n\n0.000006\n\n0.000004\n\n0.000002\n\n0 2 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 Salary ($thousands)\nNOTE: Salary distribution smoothed using kernel density techniques.

Demographically, men differ from women, and minorities differ from nonminorities; thus, their employment patterns also are likely to differ. For example, because larger numbers of women and minorities entered S&E fields only recently, women and minority men generally are younger than nonHispanic white males and have fewer years of experience. Age and stage in career in turn influence such employmentrelated factors as salary, position, tenure, and work activity. In addition, employment patterns vary by field (see sidebar \"Growth of Representation of Women and Ethnic Minorities in S&E Occupations\"), and these differences influence S&E employment, unemployment, salaries, and work activities. Highest degree earned, yet another important influence, particularly affects primary work activity and salary.\nRepresentation of Women in S&E Women constituted more than one-fourth (26%) of the\ncollege-educated workforce in S&E occupations (and more than one-third, 37%, of those with S&E degrees) but close to half (47%) of the total U.S. college-educated labor force in 2005.\n\nFigure 3-25 Age distribution of individuals in S&E occupations, by sex: 2003\nDensity (percent)\n0.035\n\n0.030\n\n0.025\n\n0.020 0.015\n\nFemale Male\n\n0.010\n\n0.005\n\n0 21 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52 56 60 64 68 72 76 Age (years)\nNOTE: Age distribution smoothed with kernel density techniques.

Differences in age and related time spent in the workforce account for many of the differences in employment characteristics between men and women. On average, women in the S&E workforce are younger than men (figures 3-25 and 3-26): 46% of women and 31% of men employed as scientists and engineers in 2003 received their degrees within the past 10 years. The\n\ndifference is even more profound at the doctoral level, which has a much greater concentration of female doctoral degree holders in their late 30s. One consequence of this age distribution is that a much larger proportion of male scientists and engineers at all degree levels, but particularly at the doctoral level, will reach traditional retirement age during the next decade. This alone will have a significant effect on sex\n\nGrowth of Representation of Women and Ethnic Minorities in S&E Occupations\n\nA view of changes in the gender and ethnic composition of the S&E workforce can be achieved by examining data on college-educated individuals in nonacademic S&E occupations from the 1980\u00ad2000 censuses and the 2005 American Community Survey* (figures 3-27 and 3-28).\nIn 2005, the percentage of historically underrepresented groups in S&E occupations remained lower than the percentage of those groups in the total college-educated workforce:\n Women made up 25.8% of college-degreed individuals in S&E occupations and 47.2% of the college-degreed workforce. Among doctorate holders working in S&E occupations in 2005, women were 30.6% of the total, while representing 34.1% of doctorate holders in the labor force.\n Blacks made up 5.1% of the S&E workforce and 7.5% of the college-degreed workforce.\n Hispanics made up 5.2% of the S&E workforce and 5.8% of the college-degreed workforce.\n Among doctorate holders working in S&E occupations in 2005, all underrepresented ethnic groups combined (blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians/Alaska Natives) were 6.1%, while representing 9.1% of doctorate holders in the labor force.\nHowever, since 1980, the share of S&E occupations has almost doubled for blacks (2.6% to 5.1%) and more than doubled for women (12.0% to 25.8%) and Hispanics (2.0% to 5.2%). Among doctorate holders (measured only since 1990), women increased in representation from 22.8% to 30.6%; and blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians/Alaska Natives increased from 4.4% to 6.1%.\n\nFigure 3-27 College-educated women and ethnic minorities in nonacademic S&E occupations: 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2005\n\nPercent\n30 1980\n\n1990\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0 Women\n\nBlack\n\nHispanic\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Decennial Census Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), 1980\u00ad2000; and Census Bureau, American Community Survey, 2005.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nFigure 3-28 Women and ethnic minority doctorate holders in nonacademic S&E occupations: 1990, 2000, and 2005\n\nPercent\n35 1990\n30\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n*The Census Bureau no longer reports postsecondary teaching occupations by field of instruction, so it is not possible to identify S&E professors from the decennial Public Use Microdata Sample, the American Community Survey, or the Current Population Survey.

Representation of men and women also differs according to field of occupation. For example, in 2003, women constituted 52% of social scientists, compared with 29% of physical scientists and 11% of engineers (figure 3-29). Since 1993, the percentage of women in most S&E occupations in NSF's labor force surveys has gradually increased from 23% to 27% across all S&E occupations. However, in mathematics and computer sciences, the percentage of women declined about 2 percentage points between 1993 and 2003.\nLabor Force Participation, Employment, and Unemployment. Unemployment rates were somewhat higher for women in S&E occupations than for men in 2003: 3.7% of men and 4.2% of women were unemployed. By comparison, the unemployment rate in 1993 was 2.7% for men and 2.1% for women (table 3-12).\nRepresentation of Racial and Ethnic Minorities in S&E\nWith the exception of Asians/Pacific Islanders, racial and ethnic minorities represent only a small proportion of those employed in S&E occupations in the United States. Collectively, blacks, Hispanics, and other ethnic groups (the latter includes American Indians/Alaska Natives) constitute 24% of the total U.S. population, 13% of college graduates, and 10% of the college educated in S&E occupations.\nAlthough Asians/Pacific Islanders constitute only 5% of the U.S. population, they accounted for 7% of college graduates and 14% of those employed in S&E occupations in 2003. Although 82% of Asians/Pacific Islanders in S&E occupations were foreign born, native-born Asians/Pacific Islanders are more highly represented in S&E than in the workforce as a whole.\nAge Distribution. As in the case of women, underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities are much younger than nonHispanic whites in the same S&E occupations (figure 3-30), and this is even truer for doctoral degree holders in S&E occupations (figure 3-31). In the near future, a much greater proportion of non-Hispanic white doctoral degree holders in S&E occupations will be reaching traditional retirement ages compared with underrepresented racial and ethnic minority doctoral degree holders. Indeed, unlike the distribution of ages of male and female doctoral degree holders, the slope of the right-hand side of the age distribution is far steeper for non-Hispanic whites. This implies a more rapid increase in the numbers retiring or otherwise leaving S&E employment. It should also be noted that Asian/Pacific Islander doctoral degree holders in S&E occupations (measured by race and not by place of birth) are on average the youngest racial/ethnic group.\n\nChapter 3.

Asian/Pacific Islander, black, and American Indian/Alaska Native scientists and engineers tend to work in different fields than their white and Hispanic counterparts. Fewer Asians/Pacific Islanders work in social sciences than in other fields. In 2003, they constituted 4% of social scientists but more than 11% of engineers and more than 13% of individuals working in mathematics and computer sciences. More black scientists and engineers work in social sciences and in computer sciences and mathematics than in other fields. In 2003, blacks constituted approximately 5% of social scientists, 4% of computer scientists and mathematicians, 3% of physical scientists and engineers, and 2% of life scientists. Other ethnic groups (which include American Indians/Alaska Natives) work predominantly in social and life sciences, accounting for 0.4% of social and life scientists and 0.3% or less of scientists in other fields in 2003. Hispanics appear to have a more even representation across all fields, constituting approximately 2.5%\u00ad4.5% of scientists and engineers in each field.\nSalary Differentials Trends in Median Salaries. In 2003, female scientists\nand engineers earned a median annual salary of $53,000, about 25% less than the median annual salary of $70,000 earned by male scientists and engineers (table 3-13). Several\n\nfactors may contribute to these salary differentials. Women more often work in educational institutions, in social science occupations, and in nonmanagerial positions; they also tend to have fewer years of experience.\nBetween 1993 and 2003, median annual salaries for women in S&E occupations increased by 33%, compared with an increase of 40% for male median salaries (table 3-13). This may be because relatively more women than men have recently entered these occupations.\nSalaries for individuals in S&E occupations also vary among the different racial and ethnic groups. In 2003 whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders in S&E occupations earned similar median annual salaries of $67,000 and $70,000, respectively, compared with $60,000 for Hispanics and $58,000 for blacks (table 3-13). Some limited sign of convergence appears in data from 1993 to 2003, with the median salary for blacks in S&E occupations rising 45% versus 40% for whites, but the absolute salary differential actually rose.\nAnalysis of Salary Differentials. It is often difficult to use gross differences in the salaries of women and ethnic minorities in S&E as indicators of the progress of individuals in those groups in S&E employment. Differences in average age, work experience, fields of degree, and other characteristics can make direct comparison of salary and earnings statistics\n\nFigure 3-30 Age distribution of individuals in S&E occupations, by race/ethnicity: 2003\nDensity (percent)\n0.050\n\n0.045 0.040 0.035 0.030\n\nAsian Underrepresented minority Non-Hispanic white\n\n0.025\n\n0.020\n\n0.015\n\n0.010\n\n0.005\n\n0 21 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52 56 60 64 68 72 76 Age (years)\nNOTES: Age distribution smoothed with kernel density techniques.

Generally, engineers earn a higher salary than social scientists, and newer employees earn less than those with more experience. One common statistical method that can be used to look simultaneously at salary and other differences is regression analysis.6 Table 3-14 shows estimates of salary differences for different groups after controlling for several individual characteristics. Although this type of analysis can provide insight, it cannot give definitive answers to questions about the openness of S&E to women and minorities for many reasons. The most basic reason is that no labor force survey ever captures information on all individual skill\n\nsets, personal background and attributes, or other characteristics that may affect compensation.\nDifferences in mean annual salary are substantial when comparing all individuals with S&E degrees only by level of degree, with no other statistical controls: in 2003, women with S&E bachelor's degrees had full-time mean salaries that were 34.2% less than those of men with S&E bachelor's degrees. Blacks, Hispanics, and individuals in other underrepresented ethnic groups with S&E bachelor's degrees had full-time salaries that were 18.8% less than those of non-Hispanic whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders with S&E bachelor's degrees.7\n\nTable 3-14 Estimated salary differentials of individuals with S&E degrees, by individual characteristics: 2003\n(Percent)\n\nVariable\n\nBachelor's\n\nMaster's\n\nDoctorate\n\nFemale vs. male .........................................................................................................

These raw differences in salary are lower but still large at the doctoral level (\u00ad18.5% for women and \u00ad13.2% for underrepresented ethnic groups). Foreign-born individuals with U.S. S&E degrees have slightly lower salaries than U.S. natives (\u00ad2.7% at the bachelor's and \u00ad1.8% at the doctoral levels), but at the master's degree level earn 10.0% more than U.S. natives.\nEffects of Age and Years Since Degree on Salary Differentials. Salary differences between men and women reflect to some extent the lower average ages of women with degrees in most S&E fields. Controlling for differences in age and years since receipt of degree reduces salary differentials for women compared with men by only about 1 percentage point at the bachelor's (to \u00ad33.2%) and master's (to \u00ad30.6), but by two-fifths at the doctoral level (to \u00ad11.1%).8 Two factors may explain why statistical controls make less difference at lower degree levels: a similar proportion of men and women with S&E degrees are in midcareer, but a larger proportion of men are at older ages where salaries begin to decline.\nSimilar small drops in salary differentials are found for underrepresented ethnic minorities. Such controls reduce salary differentials of underrepresented minorities compared with non-Hispanic whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders by only 1 or 2 percentage points at the bachelor's and master's degree levels, but by half at the doctoral level (to \u00ad6.6%).\nEffects of Field of Degree on Salary Differentials. Controlling for field of degree and for age and years since degree reduces the estimated salary differentials for women with S&E degrees to \u00ad25.4% at the bachelor's level and to \u00ad7.9% at the doctoral level.9 These reductions generally reflect the greater concentration of women in the lower-paying social and life sciences as opposed to engineering and computer sciences. As noted above, this identifies only one factor associated with salary differences and does not speak to why differences exist between men and women in field of degree or whether salaries are affected by the percentage of women with degrees in each field.\nField of degree is associated with significant estimated salary differentials for underrepresented ethnic groups relative to all other ethnic groups. Controlling for field of degree further reduces salary differentials to \u00ad13.6% for those individuals with S&E bachelor's degrees and to \u00ad5.2% for those individuals with S&E doctorates. Thus, age, years since degree, and field of degree are associated with two-thirds of doctoral-level salary differentials for underrepresented ethnic groups.\nCompared with natives, foreign-born individuals with advanced S&E degrees show no statistically significant salary differences when controlling for age, years since degree, and field of degree. At the bachelor's degree level, foreign-born S&E degree holders still had a \u00ad6.3% salary differential.\n\nEffects of Occupation and Employer Characteristics on Salary Differentials. Occupation and employer characteristics affect compensation.10 Academic and nonprofit employers typically pay less for the same skills than employers pay in the private sector, and government compensation falls somewhere between the two groups. Other factors affecting salary are relation of work performed to degree earned: whether the person is working in S&E or in R&D, employer size, and U.S. region. However, occupation and employer characteristics may not be determined solely by individual choice, for they may also reflect in part an individual's career success.\nWhen comparing women with men and underrepresented ethnic groups with non-Hispanic whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders, controlling for occupation and employer reduces salary differentials somewhat beyond what is found when controlling for age, years since degree, and field of degree. At the doctoral level, the addition of occupation leaves no statistically significant difference between the salaries of underrepresented ethnic groups, compared with whites and Asians. For the foreign born, controlling for occupational characteristics actually moves differentials in a negative direction, suggesting that the foreign born generally have better-paying occupations than natives.\nEffects of Family and Personal Characteristics on Salary Differentials. Marital status, the presence of children, parental education, and other personal characteristics are often associated with differences in compensation. Although these differences may involve discrimination, they may also reflect many subtle individual differences that might affect work productivity.11 For example, having highly educated parents is associated with higher salaries for individuals of all ethnicities and genders, and may well be associated with greater academic achievement not directly measured in these data. However, for many individuals in many ethnic groups, historical discrimination probably affected parents' educational opportunities and achievement.\nAs with occupation and employer characteristics, controlling for these characteristics changes salary differentials only slightly for each group and degree level. However, it does have enough of an effect to eliminate the rest of the estimated salary differentials for both underrepresented ethnic groups with advanced S&E degrees vis-\u00e0-vis all others, and for foreign-born individuals vis-\u00e0-vis native-born individuals.\nAn additional issue for the wage differentials of women, however, is that family and child variables often have different effects for men and women. Marriage is associated with higher salaries for both men and women with S&E degrees, but has a larger positive association for men. Children have a positive association with salary for men but a negative association with salary for women, except at the doctoral level, where children have no statistically significant effect. Allowing for these differences in gender effects in the model reduces the salary differential at the bachelor's degree level\n\n\f3-32 \n\nChapter 3. Science and Engineering Labor Force\n\nby 10.4 percentage points (to \u00ad7.8%) and at the master's level by 9.4 percentage points (to 5.8%), and leaves no statistical significant difference in earnings at the doctoral level.\nLabor Market Conditions for Recent S&E Graduates\nCompared with experienced S&E workers, recent S&E graduates more often bring newly acquired skills to the labor market and have relatively few work or family commitments that limit their job mobility. As a result, measures of the success of recent graduates in securing good jobs can be sensitive indicators of changes in the S&E labor market.\nThis section looks at a number of standard labor market indicators for recent S&E degree recipients at all degree levels, and examines a number of other indicators that may apply only to recent S&E doctorate recipients. In general, NSF's data on recent graduates in 2003 reflect the economic downturn that started in 2001 and its unusually large effect on R&D expenditure, state government budgets, and universities, all areas of importance for scientists and engineers.\nGeneral Labor Market Indicators for Recent Graduates\nSome basic labor market statistics are summarized for recent (defined here as those between 1 and 5 years since degree) recipients of S&E degrees in table 3-15. Across all fields of S&E degrees in 2003, there was a 4.7% unemployment rate for bachelor's degree holders who received their degrees in the previous 1\u00ad5 years. This ranged from 4.0% for physical sciences degree recipients to 5.1% for social science degree recipients. Although individuals often change jobs more often\n\nand have higher unemployment early in their careers, all of these values are less than the unemployment rate for the full labor force in 2003 of 6.0%. For doctorate recipients across all fields of degree, the unemployment rate was 2.8%.\nA more subjective indicator of labor market conditions is the percentage of recent graduates who report that they sought, but could not find, full-time employment related to their field of degree. The IOF employment rate is a measure unique to NSF's labor force surveys. Because highly educated people are usually able to find employment of some kind, the IOF rate is sometimes a more sensitive indicator of changing conditions in the S&E labor market than the unemployment rate. At the bachelor's degree level, across all S&E fields, the IOF rate was 11.5%, but ranged from 3.6% for recent engineering bachelor's graduates to 15.7% in the social sciences. In all fields of degree, the IOF rate decreases with level of education, reaching 2.9% for recent doctorate recipients.\nAverage salary for recent S&E bachelor's degree recipients in 2003 was $40,900, ranging from $34,300 in the life sciences to $53,500 in engineering. Recent master's recipients had average salaries of $55,200 and recent doctorate recipients only about $5,000 more at $60,300. This reflects in part the relatively low postdoc salaries of some recent doctorate recipients (see discussion in next section) and the greater employment of doctorate holders in academia.\nEmployment and Career Paths for Recent Bachelor's and Master's Recipients\nAlthough a very subjective measure, one indicator of labor market conditions is whether recent graduates feel that they are in \"career-path\" jobs. Most recently in 1999, the National Survey of Recent College Graduates asked new S&E\n\nTable 3-15 Labor market indicators for recent S&E degree recipients 1\u00ad5 years after receiving degree, by field: 2003\n(Percent)\n\nIndicator\n\nComputer/ All S&E fields mathematical sciences Life sciences Physical sciences Social sciences Engineering\n\nUnemployment rate Bachelor's .........................

Approximately two-thirds of all S&E master's degree recipients and one-half of all S&E bachelor's degree recipients held a career-path job in 1999 (figure 3-32). Graduates with degrees in computer and information sciences or in engineering were more likely to hold careerpath jobs compared with graduates with degrees in other fields: about three-quarters of recent bachelor's and master's degree graduates in engineering or computer and mathematical sciences reported that they held career-path jobs.\nRecent Doctoral Degree Recipients\nAnalyses of labor market conditions for scientists and engineers holding doctorate degrees often focus on the ease or difficulty of beginning careers for recent doctoral degree recipients. Although a doctorate degree opens career opportunities both in terms of salary and type of employment, these opportunities come at the price of many years of foregone labor market earnings. Some doctoral degree holders also face an additional period of low earnings while in a postdoc position. In addition, some doctoral degree holders do not obtain the jobs they desire after completing their education.\nSince the 1950s, the federal government has actively encouraged graduate training in S&E through numerous mechanisms. Doctorate programs have served multiple facets of the national interest by providing a supply of highly trained and motivated graduate students to aid university-based research. These programs have not only provided individuals with detailed, highly specialized training in particular areas of research, they have also cultivated a general ability to perform self-initiated research in more diverse areas.\n\nThe career rewards of highly skilled individuals in general, and doctoral degree holders in particular, often cannot be measured by just salary and employment. Their technical and problem-solving skills make them highly employable, but they often attach great importance to the opportunity to do a type of work they care about and for which they have been trained. For that reason, no single measure can satisfactorily reflect the state of the doctoral S&E labor market. Some of the available labor market indicators, such as unemployment rates, IOF employment, satisfaction with field of study, employment in academia versus other sectors, postdoc positions, and salaries, are discussed below.\nAggregate measures of labor market conditions for recent (1\u00ad3 years after receipt of degree) U.S. S&E doctoral degree recipients in 2006 show improvement from the already generally good rates found when last measured in 2003: unemployment fell from 2.3% to 1.3% and IOF rates fell from 3.3% to 1.3% (table 3-16). There was also an increase in the percentage of the most recent graduates entering tenuretrack programs at 4-year institutions--from 17.8% in 2003 to 19.2% in 2006.\nUnemployment The 1.3% unemployment rate for recent S&E doctoral\ndegree recipients as of April 2006 was even lower than other generally low 2006 unemployment rates. The 2006 unemployment rate for all civilian workers was 4.6%, with lower rates of 2.2% for those with a bachelor's degree or above and 1.6% for those in S&E occupations.\nThe highest unemployment rates were for recent doctoral degree recipients in mechanical engineering (3.0%) and sociology/anthropology (2.4%). Unemployment in both fields (which also had the highest unemployment rates in 2003) fell from 5.8% and 5.0%, respectively, in 2003.\n\nFigure 3-32 Recent S&E recipients in career-path jobs within 3 months of degree, by field: 1999\nPercent 80\nBachelor's Master's\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0 All S&E\n\nEngineering\n\nLife sciences\n\nMathematics/ computer sciences\n\nPhysical sciences\n\nSocial sciences\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, National Survey of Recent College Graduates,1999.

Although this measure is more subjective than the unemployment rate, the IOF rate often proves to be a more sensitive indicator of labor market difficulties for a highly educated and employable population. However, it is best to use both the IOF rate along with unemployment rates and other measures as different indicators of labor market success or distress.\nThe highest IOF rates were found for recent doctoral degree recipients in chemical engineering (9.8%), physics/ astronomy (5.9%) and sociology/anthropology (4.8%).\n\nTenure-Track Positions Most S&E doctoral degree holders ultimately do not\nwork in academia, and there has been a long-term decline in this proportion, as academic opportunities grew slower than those in other sectors of the economy. In recent years, however, the proportion of all recent doctorate recipients in the labor force who are in tenure-track academic jobs (the tenure-track rate) has increased. Increases in the rate of new doctorate holders entering tenure-track positions at 4-year academic institutions were observed in NSF surveys between 2001 and 2003, and again between 2003 and 2006. As a result, in 2006, tenure-track rates for both those 1\u00ad3 years after degree and 4\u00ad6 years after degree returned roughly to the same rates found in 1993 (figure 3-33 and table 3-17). The rate for those 1\u00ad3 years since degree rose from 17.8% to 19.2% and the rate for those 4\u00ad6 years since degree increased from 23.5% to 25.8%. (See chapter 5 for a discussion of trends in tenure-track positions as a proportion of all academic positions.)\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 3-35\n\nAcademia is just one possible sector of employment for S&E doctorate holders, but the availability of tenure-track positions is an important aspect of the job market for individuals who seek academic careers. Changes over time in tenure-track employment reflect availability of tenure-track job opportunities in academia and the availability of nonacademic employment opportunities. For example, one of the quickest declines in tenure-track employment occurred in computer sciences, from 51.5% in 1993 to 23.6% in 2001, despite many discussions about difficulties that computer science departments were having finding faculty (figure 3-33).\nSalaries for Recent S&E Doctoral Degree Recipients\nIn 2006 for all fields of degree the median annual salary for recent S&E doctoral degree recipients 1\u00ad5 years after their degrees was $52,000. Across various S&E fields of degree, median annual salaries ranged from a low of $46,000 in the life sciences to a high of $70,000 in engineering (table 3-18).\nBy type of employment, salaries for recent doctoral degree recipients range from $40,000 for postdoc positions to $80,000 for those employed by private for-profit business (table 3-19).\n\nFigure 3-33 Doctorate recipients holding tenure and tenuretrack appointments at academic institutions 4\u00ad6 years after degree, by field: 1993\u00ad2006\n\nPercent\n\n60 All S&E\n\nEngineering\n\nLife sciences\n\n50\n\nMathematics/\n\ncomputer sciences\n\nPhysical sciences\n\n40\n\nSocial sciences\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0 1993\n\n1995\n\n1997\n\n1999\n\n2001\n\n2003\n\n2006\n\nNOTE: Two-year institutions not included.

Neither the reasons for its growth, nor the effect of the growth on the health of science, are well understood. Are new doctoral degree recipients more likely to enter postdoc positions because of increased competition for tenure-track academic research jobs? Are postdoc positions needed more than in the past because of the increasing team nature of research and the increased need for training?\nAlthough individuals in postdoc positions perform much cutting-edge research, there is a concern that time spent in a postdoc position is time added onto the already long time spent earning a doctorate, thereby delaying their career advancement. Because postdoc positions usually pay much less than these highly educated individuals could make in other employment, forgone earnings add significantly to the costs of a doctoral education and may discourage doctorallevel careers in S&E.\nPostdocs by Academic Discipline Around half (49%) of U.S.-educated S&E doctorate re-\ncipients in postdoc positions in April 2006 had doctorates in the biological sciences, well above the 23% they represented of all S&E doctorates awarded in 2005 (figure 3-34). The high representation among postdocs of biological sciences doctorates reflects both the field's high rate of entering postdocs (about three-fifths of the 2002\u00ad05 graduation cohort) and the relatively long periods these individuals spent in postdoc positions. Other fields with high rates of entering postdocs (psychology, chemistry, and physics) make up another one-quarter of postdocs. The remaining quarter come from all other fields of S&E, most of which do not have strong traditions of a postdoc position being a normal part of a doctoral career path.\nHow Many Postdocs Are There? No single data source measures the entire population of\npostdocs, and some parts of the population are not systematically measured at all. Two NSF surveys, the Survey of Doctorate Recipients and the Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering (GSS), include data bearing on the number of postdocs in the United States.\nSDR covers U.S. residents who have earned S&E and health doctorates from U.S. schools (MDs and other types of degrees with \"doctor\" in the name are not included). Thus, postdocs who received doctorate degrees from foreign institutions are not included in SDR. In 2006, SDR collected data on the dates of current and past postdoc positions, allowing an estimate to be made of the number of postdocs in fall 2005, the same period as the most recent GSS data. Unlike SDR, which collects data from individuals, GSS surveys academic departments. GSS asks departments that offer graduate programs in S&E and specific health-related\n\n\f3-36 \n\nChapter 3.

However, unlike SDR, it does not gather data on people in nonacademic positions or academic units that lack graduate programs, including many academic research organizations and affiliated nonprofit research centers.\nTable 3-20 shows the estimates that SDR and GSS provide for those parts of the U.S. postdoc population that they\n\nmeasure. Estimates for many, but not all, parts of the postdoc population can be derived from these data sources and used to piece together an overall national estimate for fall 2005. However, any overall estimate involves numerous uncertainties and assumptions.\nAcademic Postdocs. SDR estimates that 22,900 U.S. citizens and permanent residents were in academic postdoc positions in the fall of 2005.13 The 2005 GSS estimate (16,200) is substantially lower, in part because postdocs affiliated with some non-degree-granting academic departments and research centers are not captured on GSS. In addition, the individuals surveyed by SDR and the departments surveyed by GSS may have somewhat different views on whether an individual should be classified as a postdoc.\nNot surprisingly, GSS reports a much larger number of academic postdocs with temporary visas (26,600) than SDR (7,700). The most likely explanation for this gap is that GSS, unlike SDR, includes people with doctorates from non-U.S. universities in its counts.14\nOther Postdocs. Neither survey includes data on the number of foreign-educated postdocs. SDR estimates that 29% of U.S.-educated postdocs, 13,000 total, are in industry, nonprofits, government, and other types of educational institutions. There is no reason to believe that the proportions of U.S. and foreign-educated postdocs in nonacademic positions are similar.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 3-37\n\nTable 3-19 Median annual salary of recent doctorate recipients 1\u00ad5 years after receiving degree, by type of employment: 2006\n(Dollars)\n\nField\n\nAll sectors\n\nPrivate\n\nTenure track\n\nNonprofit/ Postdoc Other education government\n\nAll S&E fields ........................................

This increase over time occurred both in fields in which postdocs have been traditionally important and in those in which only a small number of doctoral degree recipients went on to postdoc positions. In the high postdoc fields such as the life sciences (from 46%\u00ad60%) and the physical sciences (from 41%\u00ad61%), a majority of doctoral degree recipients now have a postdoc position as part of their career path. Similar increases were found in mathematical and computer sciences (19%\u00ad31%), social sciences (18%\u00ad30%), and engineering (14%\u00ad38%). The increasing use of postdoc positions in engineering is particularly noteworthy, with recent engineering doctoral degree recipients now being almost as likely to take a postdoc position as physical sciences doctoral degree recipients were 35 years ago.\nThere have also been increases in the average length of time spent in a postdoc position, most notably in the life sciences (figure 3-36). The median length of time spent in postdoc positions for life science doctoral degree recipients grew from 24 months for pre-1972 graduates to 46 months for 1992\u00ad96 graduates. Although the median length of time in a postdoc position for those who completed postdoc positions falls for later graduation cohorts, this in part reflects some individuals who did not enter a postdoc position immediately after graduation and were still in the position in April 2006. The increase in the time spent in postdoc positions in the physical sciences was more modest, rising from a median of 21 months to 30 months for 1992\u00ad96 graduates. In contrast, in psychology, which is a high-postdoc rate discipline, median months in postdoc positions has remained\n\n\f3-38 \n\nChapter 3.

In all other areas of S&E taken together, the estimated median months in postdoc positions has also shown little growth, and is never higher than the 23 months estimated for the 1972\u00ad76 cohort. In these nontraditional postdoc fields, the growing importance of postdoc positions is driven by the increased rate of entering postdocs, and not by the length of the postdoc appointment.\nPostdoc Pay and Benefits Low pay and fewer benefits for postdocs are frequently\nraised as concerns by those worried about the effect of the increasing use of postdocs on the attractiveness of science careers. The median academic postdoc salary is one-third less than the median salary for nonpostdocs 1\u00ad3 years after receiving their doctorates, as shown in table 3-21. By broad field, this ranges from a 44% pay gap with recent engineering doctoral degree recipients to a 25% gap for doctorate holders in the social sciences. Nonacademic postdocs have better pay than academic postdocs, but the medium salary is still 20% less than for nonpostdocs.\n\nMost individuals in postdoc positions in 2006 did have employment benefits. Indeed, across all S&E fields, 90% of postdocs reported having medical benefits and 49% reported having retirement benefits. It is not possible to know from the survey how extensive medical benefits may be, or how transferable retirement benefits are. In the social sciences, medical benefits are somewhat less available, with only 75% of postdocs reporting that they had medical benefits.\nThe perception that postdocs do not receive employee benefits does have a historical basis. As shown in figure 3-37, among former postdocs who received their S&E doctorates before 1972, only 59% of biological science postdocs and 60% of postdocs in all other fields reported having medical benefits, and only 16% and 18%, respectively, reported having retirement benefits. The prevalence of both types of employment benefits for postdocs has risen fairly steadily over time.\nPostdocs as a Sign of Labor Market Distress for Recent Doctoral Degree Recipients\nFormer postdoc position holders were asked about the reason they accepted a postdoc appointment. Most respondents reported reasons consistent with the traditional view\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 3-39\n\nFigure 3-35 Proportion ever holding a postdoc among S&E doctorate holders, by field and year of doctorate: 2006\nPercent 70\nLife sciences 60\n\nFigure 3-36 Median time spent in postdoc postions for S&E doctorate recipients completing postdocs, by field and year of doctorate: 2006\nMonths 50\nLife sciences 40\n\n50 Physical sciences\n\n40\n\nAll S&E 30\nSocial sciences\n\n20\nEngineering 10\n\nMathematics/ computer sciences\n\n0 Pre1972\n\n1972\u00ad 1977\u00ad 1982\u00ad 1987\u00ad 1992\u00ad 1997\u00ad 2002\u00ad\n\n76\n\n81\n\n86\n\n91\n\n96 2001 05\n\nYear of doctorate\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Survey of Doctorate Recipients, 2006 (preliminary data).\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nof postdoc appointments as a type of apprenticeship, such as seeking \"additional training in doctorate field\" or \"training in an area outside of doctorate field.\" However, 9% of respondents in a postdoc position in April 2006 reported that they took their current postdoc position because \"other employment not available.\" This reason was given by 5% of postdocs in the life science; 8% in computer and mathematical sciences; 10% in the physical sciences; 14% in the social sciences; and 16% in engineering.\nA cohort trend for former and current postdocs who reported taking their first postdoc position because no other employment was available is shown in figure 3-38. Across all S&E fields, this proportion has a peak at 12% for both the 1972\u00ad76 and the 1992\u00ad96 graduation cohorts (5% in 1992\u00ad96 if looked at as a proportion of all doctorate holders).

However, available data do not permit definitive judgments about whether the experience gained in a postdoc position produced these differences. For example, those who entered postdoc positions may have already been more interested in research careers, and may have already given employers a reason to believe they have the ability and aptitude for such a career.\nMost former postdocs report that the postdoc experience was helpful to their career, and the proportion of former postdocs saying this is remarkably constant over different doctorate graduation cohorts (figure 3-39). Across all S&E fields and cohorts, 53%\u00ad56% of former postdocs said that their postdoc experience \"greatly helped\" their careers. Across all cohorts, an additional 33%\u00ad38% said that their postdoc experience \"somewhat helped\" their careers. The proportion of those completing postdoc positions who said that it was no help to their careers ranged from only 8% for the 2002\u00ad05 graduation cohort to 12% for the 1987\u00ad2001 cohort.\nNonetheless, there are only modest differences in many measures of the career status of former postdocs and nonpostdocs in 2006.

The differences between the tenuretrack rates were larger for computer and mathematical sciences (a 21 percentage point difference), and for engineering and the physical sciences (each with a 14 percentage point difference between former postdocs and nonpostdocs in the proportion in tenure track). However, in the life sciences, where it is often said that a postdoc position is a requirement for an academic career, there is only a 5 percentage point difference between former postdocs and nonpostdocs in tenuretrack employment. In the social sciences, nonpostdocs are actually slightly more likely to be in a tenure-track position, but this may be because many postdoc positions in psychology provide primarily clinical training.\nChanges in the proportion in 2006 tenured or tenure-track positions can be seen in figure 3-40. In the life sciences, the tenure-track rate has generally declined for more recent graduation cohorts for both former postdocs and nonpostdocs, with the largest gap of 12 percentage points occurring in the oldest graduation cohort, those receiving their doctorate prior to 1972. In contrast, in the physical sciences, the tenuretrack rate is relatively constant across graduation cohorts for former postdocs, with former postdocs being 18 percentage points more likely than nonpostdocs to be in a tenure-track position among the newest, not the oldest, cohort. In psychology, there is a similar proportion going into tenure-track positions among most graduation cohorts. In all other S&E fields, there is a higher tenure-track rate for former postdocs\n\nthat varies greatly by graduation cohort and ranges from 3 to 18 percentage points above the rate for nonpostdocs.\nThe 1997\u00ad2001 graduation cohort is the most recent to be almost entirely finished with postdoc experiences. In this cohort, the additional proportion in tenure-track positions for former postdocs ranged from 21 percentage points in the mathematical and computer sciences to minus 5 percentage points in the social sciences, where nonpostdocs have higher tenure-track rates (figure 3-41).\nFormer postdocs are also more likely than nonpostdocs to have R&D as a major work activity, defined here as reporting that basic research, applied research, design, or development is the work activity on which they spend the greatest, or second greatest amount of time. In the 1997\u00ad2001 graduation cohort, 73% of former postdocs had R&D as a major work activity in 2006, compared with 59% among those who\n\nFigure 3-40 S&E doctorate holders in tenured or tenure-track positions in 2006, by field, postdoc status, and year of doctorate: 2006\n\nPercent\n\n80\n\nPsychology: Nonpostdoc\n\nPsychology: Former postdoc\n\nAll other S&E: Nonpostdoc\n\nAll other S&E: Former postdoc\n\nLife sciences: Nonpostdoc\n\nLife sciences: Former postdoc\n\n60\n\nPhysical sciences: Nonpostdoc\n\nPhysical sciences: Former postdoc\n\nFigure 3-39\n\nFormer postdocs' evaluation of degree to which\n\npostdoc position helped career, by year of\n\ndoctorate: 2006\n\n40\n\nNo help\n\nSomewhat a help\n\nPercent\n\nGreat help\n\n100\n\n80\n\n20\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nYear of doctorate\n\nPre- 1972\u00ad 1977\u00ad 1982\u00ad 1987\u00ad 1992\u00ad 1997\u00ad 2002\u00ad\n\n1972 76 81 86 91 96 2001 05\n\nYear of doctorate\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Survey of Doctorate Recipients, 2006 (preliminary data).\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n0 Pre1972\n\n1972\u00ad 1977\u00ad 1982\u00ad 1987\u00ad 1992\u00ad 1997\u00ad 2002\u00ad\n\n76\n\n81\n\n86\n\n91\n\n96 2001 05\n\nYear of doctorate\n\nNOTES: Excludes those still in postdoc position in April 2006.

This increased likelihood to do R&D exists for all broad S&E fields of degree, and ranges from 7 percentage points in the social sciences to 21 percentage points in the life sciences.\nFormer postdocs are also somewhat more likely to report that their job is closely related to their degree. Although over 90% of S&E doctorate holders report that their job is at least somewhat related to their degree, smaller proportions report that it is closely related. In the 1997\u00ad2001 graduation cohort, 73% of former postdocs reported that their job was closely related to their degree in 2006, compared with 65% among those who never had a postdoc position (figure 3-43). The difference in reporting of a job closely related to degree ranged from 5 percentage points in the life sciences to 17 percentage points in engineering and the physical sciences.\nTaking a postdoc position delays an individual's entry into a career path with a more permanent employer, but also may provide the individual with valuable experience and skills. Figure 3-44 shows the difference in the 2006 salary of former postdocs and nonpostdocs by field of degree and sector of employment. For this purpose, an older cohort, 1992\u00ad96 doctoral degree graduates, is used for comparison to allow somewhat more time for former postdocs to demonstrate their performance with an employer. In all fields of degree, former postdocs working for a private noneducational employer earned less than nonpostdocs in the same sector. In mathematical and computer sciences, former postdocs earned 8% less, and in all other fields former postdocs earned 10% less in the private sector. In the three fields in which enough postdocs enter government service to allow measurement--the physical sciences, life sciences,\n\nand engineering--a positive salary differential is associated with having been a postdoc, ranging from 3% in engineering to 9% in the life sciences. A more ambiguous salary differential appears among former postdocs in the educational sector, who earn more than nonpostdocs in the physical sciences, computer and mathematical sciences, and engineering, but earn less in the social sciences and life sciences.\n\nFigure 3-43 S&E doctorate holders in 1997\u00ad2001 graduation cohort with job closely related to degree field, by degree field and postdoc status: 2006\n\nPercent 100\nNo postdoc\n\nFormer postdoc\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0 All S&E\n\nEngineering Life Mathematics/ Physical sciences computer sciences sciences\n\nSocial sciences\n\nNOTE: Excludes those currently in postdoc position.

Having had a postdoc position is associated with a moderate disadvantage in salary within private noneducational employment, and a moderate advantage in government employment. A majority of former postdocs from all graduation cohorts said that their postdoc positions were a great help to their career, and only about one-tenth said that a postdoc position was of no help to their careers.\nAge and Retirement\nThe age distribution and retirement patterns of the S&E labor force affect its size, productivity, and opportunities for new S&E workers. For many decades, rapid increases in new entries into the workforce led to a relatively young pool of workers, with only a small percentage near traditional retirement age. Now, the picture is changing as individuals who earned S&E degrees in the late 1960s and early 1970s move into the latter part of their careers.\nIncreasing average age may mean increased experience and greater productivity among scientific workers. However, it could also reduce opportunities for younger researchers\n\nto make productive contributions by working independently. In many fields, scientific folklore and empirical evidence indicate that the most creative research comes from younger people (Stephan and Levin 1992).\nThis section does not attempt to project future S&E labor market trends; however, some general conclusions can be made. Absent changes in degree production, retirement patterns, or immigration, the number of S&E-trained workers in the labor force will continue to grow for some time, but the growth rate may slow significantly as a dramatically greater proportion of the S&E labor force reaches traditional retirement age. As the growth rate slows, the average age of the S&E labor force will increase.\nImplications for S&E Workforce\nNet immigration, morbidity, mortality, and, most of all, historical S&E degree production patterns affect age distribution among scientists and engineers in the workforce. With the exception of new fields such as computer sciences (in which 56% of degree holders are younger than age 40), the greatest population density of individuals with S&E degrees occurs between the ages of 30 and 49. (Figure 3-45 shows the age distribution of the labor force with S&E degrees broken down by level of degree.) In general, the majority of individuals in the labor force with S&E degrees are in their most productive years (from their late 30s through their early 50s), with the largest group ages 30\u00ad34. More than half of workers with S&E degrees are age 40 or older, and the 40\u00ad44 age group is more than two times as large as the 60\u00ad64 age group.\nThis general pattern also holds true for those individuals with S&E doctoral degrees. Because of the long time needed\n\nFigure 3-45 Age distribution of individuals in labor force with highest degree in S&E: 2003\n\nPercent of total\n\n16\n\nDoctorate 14\nMaster's\n\n12\n\nBachelor's\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0 <25 25\u00ad29 30\u00ad34 35\u00ad39 40\u00ad44 45\u00ad49 50\u00ad54 55\u00ad59 60\u00ad64 65+\nAge (years)\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), 2003, http://sestat.nsf.gov.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\f3-44 \n\nChapter 3. Science and Engineering Labor Force\n\nto obtain a doctorate, doctoral degree holders are somewhat older than individuals who have less-advanced S&E degrees. The greatest population density of S&E doctoral degree holders occurs between the ages of 40 and 54. This can be most easily seen in figure 3-46, which compares the age distribution of S&E degree holders in the labor force at each level of degree, and in figure 3-47, which shows the cumulative age distribution for individuals at each degree level. Even if one takes into account the somewhat older retirement ages of doctoral degree holders, a much larger proportion of them are near traditional retirement ages than are individuals with either S&E bachelor's or master's degrees.\nThe extent of the recent aging of the S&E labor force is highlighted in figure 3-48, which shows the age distribution of S&E doctorate holders in 1993 and 2003. S&E doctorate holders under age 35 are about the same proportion of the S&E doctoral-level labor force in both years. However, over the decade, the 35\u00ad54 age group became a much smaller part of the full S&E doctoral-level labor force. What grew was the proportion of S&E doctorate holders age 55 and older.\nAcross all degree levels and fields, 26.4% of the labor force with S&E degrees is older than age 50. The proportion ranges from 10.8% of individuals with their highest degree in computer sciences to 38.0% of individuals with their highest degree in physics (figure 3-49).\n\nFigure 3-46 Age distribution of individuals in labor force with highest degree in S&E, by degree level: 2003\nDensity (percent)\n0.035\n\n0.030\n\n0.025 0.020 0.015\n\nBachelor's Master's\n\nDoctorate\n\n0.010\n\n0.005\n\n0 21 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52 56 60 64 68 72 76 Age (years)\nNOTE: Age distribution smoothed using kernel density techniques.

This may prove particularly true for doctoral degree holders because of the steepness of their age profile. As retirements increase, the difference between the number of new degrees earned and the number of retirements will narrow (and ultimately disappear).\nTaken together, these factors suggest a slower-growing and older S&E labor force. Both trends would be accentuated if either new degree production were to drop or immigration to slow, both concerns raised by a 2003 report of the\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 3-45\n\nFigure 3-48 Age distribution of S&E doctorate holders in labor force: 1993 and 2003\nDensity (percent)\n0.040\n\n0.035 0.030 0.025\n\n1993 2003\n\n0.020\n\n0.015\n\n0.010\n\n0.005\n\n0 21 24 28 32 36 40 44 48 52 56 60 64 68 72 76\nAge (years)\nNOTE: Age distribution smoothed using kernel density techniques.

Some individuals retire from one job and continue to work part-time or even full-time at another position, sometimes even for the same employer. Others leave the workforce without a retired designation from a formal pension plan. Table 3-22 summarizes three ways of looking at changes in workforce involvement for S&E degree holders: leaving full-time employment, leaving the workforce, and retiring from a particular job.\nBy age 62, 50% of S&E bachelor's degree recipients no longer work full-time. Similarly, by age 62, 50% of master's degree recipients do not work full-time either. However, only at age 66 do S&E doctoral degree holders reach the 50% not working full-time. Longevity also differs by degree level when measuring the number of individuals who leave the workforce entirely: half of S&E bachelor's degree recipients had left the workforce entirely by age 65, but the same proportion of master's degree and doctoral degree holders did not do so until ages 66 and 70, respectively. Formal retirement also occurs at somewhat higher ages for doctoral degree holders: more than 50% of bachelor's and master's\n\nFigure 3-49 Employed S&E degree holders older than 50, by selected field: 2003\n\nPhysics Mathematical sciences\nChemistry Psychology Sociology/anthropology Mechanical engineering Geosciences Economics Agricultural sciences Chemical engineering Civil engineering Biological sciences Political science Electrical engineering Computer sciences\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\nPercent\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), 2003, http://sestat.nsf.gov.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\ndegree recipients have \"retired\" from jobs by age 62, compared with age 65 for doctoral degree holders.\nFigure 3-50 shows data on S&E degree holders working full-time at ages 55 through 69. For all degree levels, the portion of S&E degree holders who work full-time declines fairly steadily by age, but after age 55 full-time employment for doctoral degree holders becomes significantly greater than for bachelor's and master's degree holders. At age 69, 21% of doctoral degree holders work full-time, compared with 16% of bachelor's or master's degree recipients.\n\nTable 3-22 Retirement age for individuals with highest degree in S&E, by education level and age: 2003\n\nFirst age at which >50% were--\n\nNot working Not in labor Retired from\n\nHighest degree\n\nfull time\n\nforce\n\nany job\n\nBachelor's ............\n\n61\n\n65\n\n62\n\nMaster's ...............\n\n62\n\n66\n\n62\n\nDoctorate .............\n\n66\n\n70\n\n65\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), 2003, http://sestat.nsf.gov.\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\f3-46 \n\nChapter 3. Science and Engineering Labor Force\n\nTable 3-23 shows rates at which doctoral degree holders left full-time employment, by sector of employment, between 1999 and 2001 and 2001 and 2003. At nearly every age and sector of employment, a smaller proportion of doctoral degree holders left full-time employment in the more recent period than between 1999 and 2001. More examination is needed to understand why this change might have occurred.\nAlthough many S&E degree holders who formally retire from one job continue to work full- or part-time, this occurs most often among individuals younger than age 63 (table\nFigure 3-50 Older S&E degree holders working full time, by degree level: 2003\nPercent 100\nDoctorate 80\n\n3-24).

Foreignborn scientists in the United States are more than a quarter, and possibly more than a third, of the S&E doctoral degree labor force, and are even more prevalent in many physical science, engineering, and computer fields. Along with the increases in graduate education for domestic and foreign students elsewhere in the world (as discussed in chapter 2), national governments and private industry have increased their efforts to recruit the best talent from wherever it comes. As a result, the United States is becoming less dominant as a destination for migrating scientists and engineers.\nCounts of Global S&E Labor Force\nFew direct measures of the global S&E labor force exist; however, reports on the number of researchers in OECD member countries constitute one source of data. From 1993 to 2002, the number of researchers reported in OECD countries increased by 33.3% (a 4.2% average annual rate of increase) from approximately 2.5 million to 3.6 million (figure 3-51). During this same period, approximately comparable U.S. estimates increased 38.3% (a 3.7% average annual rate of increase) from about 1.0 million to 1.3 million. Of course, many scientists and engineers are in non-OECD countries, and counts of these individuals are harder to obtain. Figure 3-52, based on estimates by Robert Barro and Jong-Wha Lee (Barro and Lee 2000), shows the global distribution of tertiary education graduates (roughly equivalent in U.S. terms to individuals who have earned at least technical school or associate's degrees and also including all degrees up to doctorate) in 2000, or the most recently available data. About one-fourth of the tertiary graduates in the labor force were in the United States. However, the next three largest countries in terms of tertiary education are China, India, and Russia, which are all non-OECD members.\n\nFigure 3-51 Researchers in OECD countries: Selected years, 1993\u00ad2002\n\nThousands\n\n4,000\n\nOther OECD\n\n3,500 3,000\n\nJapan EU U.S.\n\n2,500\n\n2,000\n\n1,500\n\n1,000\n\n500\n\n0 1993\n\n1995\n\n1997\n\n1999\n\n2002\n\nEU = European Union; OECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development NOTE: 1999 and 2002 numbers reflect EU-25 membership.

Comparable data is available every 5 years on two aspects of this common phenomenon: the employment of R&D workers by U.S. firms at their foreign subsidiaries and by foreign firms at their subsidiaries in the United States.16 This information is derived from the Bureau of Economic Analysis surveys that are discussed in more detail in chapter 4.\n\n\f3-48 \n\nChapter 3. Science and Engineering Labor Force\n\nIt is worthwhile noting that these measures capture only some parts of industrial R&D employment for global economic purposes. R&D is often done by a company in one country under contract to a company in another country, in arrangements that range from simple consulting work to strategic collaborations. R&D is also done to develop products and services for specific foreign markets. Neither work is captured by measures that only look at a company's own subsidiaries. Nevertheless, R&D work by subsidiaries is important in itself, and may be an indicator of other international R&D activity.\nR&D employment in the United States by U.S. subsidiaries of foreign firms rose from 105,100 in 1994 to a peak of 135,300 in 1999, then declined to 123,900 in 2004, for an 18% net increase over the decade (figure 3-53). Over the same 10 years, R&D employment by U.S. firms at their foreign subsidiaries grew 75.8%, from 102,000 to 179,300. Most of the R&D employment at foreign subsidiaries of U.S. firms is in Europe (63.5%), followed by Asia (17.8%) and Canada (10.3%).\nAlthough the growth in R&D employment abroad by U.S. firms from 1994 to 2004 was fairly rapid (a 5.8% average annual growth rate), it does not represent a very large shift in the location of R&D employment by U.S. multinational corporations (MNCs). Over the same 10 years, domestic R&D employment of the same corporations increased by 31.0% (a 2.7% average annual rate) to 818,700 in 2004 (figure 3-54). The proportion of the total R&D employment of U.S. MNCs that is abroad increased from 14.0% in 1994 to 18.0% in 2004.\nThe data in both figures 3-53 and 3-54 are consistent with two trends discussed in this chapter: rapid growth in S&T employment in the United States occurring at the same time as a general expansion of the ability to do S&T work throughout the world.\nMigration to the United States\nMigration of skilled S&E workers across borders is increasingly seen as a major determinant of the quality and flexibility of the labor force in most industrial countries. The knowledge of scientists and engineers can be transferred across national borders more easily than many other skills. Additionally, cutting-edge research and technology inevitably create unique sets of skills and knowledge that can be transferred through the physical movement of people. The United States has benefited, and continues to benefit, from this international flow of knowledge and personnel (see Regets 2001 for a general discussion of high-skilled migration). However, competition for skilled labor continues to increase. Many countries have both increased their research investments and also made high-skilled migration an important part of national economic strategies. An NSB taskforce noted that \"[g]lobal competition for S&E talent is intensifying, such that the United States may not be able to rely on the international S&E labor market to fill unmet skill needs\"\n\nFigure 3-53 R&D employment of U.S. MNCs at their foreign affiliates and foreign MNCs at their U.S. affiliates: 1994, 1999, and 2004\n\nR&D workers (thousands)\n200 U.S. MNCs abroad\n\nForeign MNCs in U.S.\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0 1994\n\n1999\n\n2004\n\nMNC = multinational corporation\nSOURCE: Bureau of Economic Analysis, Survey of Foreign Direct Investment in the United States, and Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad, 2004 (preliminary data).\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nFigure 3-54 R&D employment of U.S. MNCs in United States and at their foreign affiliates: 1994, 1999, and 2004\n\nR&D workers (thousands)\n\n900 U.S. MNCs in U.S\n\n800\n\nPercent abroad\n\n700\n\n600\n\nPercent abroad 20\nU.S. MNC.s abroad\n15\n\n500\n10 400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n5\n\n100\n\n0 1994\n\n1999\n\n0 2004\n\nMNC = multinational corporation\nSOURCE: Bureau of Economic Analysis, Survey of Foreign Direct Investment in the United States, and Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad, 2004 (preliminary data).\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n(NSB 2003). (See sidebar \"High-Skill Migration to Canada and Japan.\")\nThe nature of high-skilled migration makes it difficult to count foreign-born scientists and engineers working in the United States. According to an estimate based on data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, slightly over one million individuals in S&E occupations (26% of all college-educated workers in these occupations)\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 3-49\n\nHigh-Skill Migration to Canada and Japan\n\nRecent debates and legislative changes in many developed (and sometimes less developed) countries have focused on visa programs for temporary high-skilled workers. Canada and Japan are just two examples of countries that have made temporary high-skilled migration important parts of national economic policies.\nIn 2005, Canada issued permanent visas to 189,000 immigrants with university degrees (figure 3-55). The ratio of such visas to the total Canadian population far exceeded the comparable ratio in the United States. For the U.S. ratio to reach the Canadian level, the United States would have had to grant 1.7 million permanent visas to college graduates in 2005; in fact, it issued only 891,000 permanent visas to adults at all education levels. The Canadian government estimated the number of workers in Canada with high-skilled temporary visas (44,000) had increased by 63% during the 1995\u00ad2005 decade (figure 3-56). This number of temporary workers is particularly notable since Canada also has relatively quick and easy pathways for those on temporary visas to obtain permanent visas. In addition, many types of workers who would need temporary work visas in the United States, such as advanced degree recipients from U.S. graduate schools, would usually be able to bypass temporary visas and qualify for a \"skilled worker\" permanent visa based upon Canada's point system.*\nA 1989 revision of Japanese immigration laws made it easier for high-skilled workers to enter Japan with temporary visas, which allow employment and residence for an indefinite period (even though the same visa classes also apply to work visits that may last for only a few months). In 2003, 268,045 workers entered Japan in high-skilled\n\nFigure 3-55 Canadian awards of permanent residency to university graduates, by degree level: 1996\u00ad2005\nThousands\n\n200\n\nDoctorate\n\nMaster's\n\n150\n\nBachelor's\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005\nSOURCE: Citizenship and Immigration Canada, Facts and Figures 2005 (2006).\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\ntemporary visa categories, a 93% increase compared with 1992 (figure 3-57). For comparison purposes, this equals half of the number of Japanese university graduates entering the labor force each year and is more than the number entering the United States in roughly similar categories (H-1B, L-1, TN, O-1, O-2) (Fuess 2001).\n\nFigure 3-56 Stock of workers in Canada on high-skilled temporary work visas, by skill level: 1996\u00ad2005\n\nThousands\n\n50 Skill level B--skilled and technical\n\nSkill level A--professionals\n\n40\n\nSkill level 0--managerial\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005\nSOURCE: Citizenship and Immigration Canada, Facts and Figures 2005 (2006).\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nFigure 3-57 High-skilled workers with visas in Japan, by region of origin: Selected years, 1992\u00ad2003\n\nEntries (thousands)\n\n300 Other\n\n250\n\nEurope\n\nNorth America\n\n200\n\nAsia\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0 1992\n\n1996\n\n1999\n\n2003\n\nSOURCES: Fuess SM Jr, Highly Skilled Workers and Japan: Is There International Mobility?

Science and Engineering Labor Force\n\nwere foreign born (table 3-25). The proportions ranged from 19% among bachelor's degree holders to 41% at the doctorate level. However, these estimates are likely to be on the low side, because census occupational classifications miss many individuals who use S&E knowledge extensively in their jobs. For example, most university professors teaching in S&E fields are excluded from census S&E occupational counts, because they are classified as \"postsecondary teacher.\" NSF 2003 SESTAT data, on the other hand, show 4.9 million college graduates in S&E occupations but 12.9 million who said they needed at least a bachelor's level of S&E knowledge in their jobs.\nNSF's labor force surveys (SESTAT) gather information on education and workplace activities that can be used to identify the broader S&E labor force and that goes beyond the data in the decennial census or the American Community Survey. However, SESTAT data also have important limitations. SESTAT excludes individuals with foreign degrees who were not in the United States for the previous decennial census. As a result, SESTAT surveys miss foreign-educated S&E workers who have entered the country since the most recent census. Because high-skilled migrants often come to the United States for just a few years to pursue training or work, this can be a serious limitation. For example, the 1999 SESTAT survey provided an estimate of 15% foreign-born among collegeeducated individuals in S&E occupations; the corresponding census estimate is about 22% (table 3-25). In the 2000 census, about 43% of all college-educated, foreign-born individuals in S&E occupations (62% of doctorate holders) reported arriving in the United States after 1990. The 1999 NSF/SRS SESTAT estimates in table 3-25 include these post-1990 arrivals only if their degrees are from a U.S. institution.\nIn contrast, 2003 SESTAT estimates of the foreign born in S&E occupations are quite close to estimates from the\n\n2000 census (table 3-25). By level of degree, SESTAT estimates are only 1 to 2 percentage points different from comparable census estimates.\nThe 2003 SESTAT survey also provides an estimate of foreign-born S&E degree holders by field of degree (table 3-26). The foreign born are over half of all holders of doctorates in engineering (including 57% of doctorate holders in electrical engineering) and in computer science. Only in the geosciences and the social sciences are the foreign born significantly less than a third of doctorate holders in S&E fields. At the bachelor's degree level, 15% of S&E degree holders were foreign born, ranging from 7% of individuals in sociology/anthropology to 27% of those in physics/ astronomy and 28% in electrical engineering.\nOrigins of S&E Immigrants Immigrant scientists and engineers come from a broad\nrange of countries. Figure 3-58 shows country-of-birth for the 2.2 million foreign-born S&E degree holders in the United States, 276,000 of whom have doctorates. Although no one source country dominates, 16% came from India and 11% came from China. Source countries for foreign-born holders of S&E doctorates are somewhat more concentrated, with China providing 22% and India 14%.\nAlthough many foreign-born scientists and engineers in the United States first came to the United States to study, many other individuals came to the United States after receiving their university training abroad (table 3-27). This fact is important both to understanding the various ways that the United States recruits highly skilled workers from around the world, but also to understanding how these workers help to connect the United States to universities and research institutions around the world. (See sidebar \"Foreign Scientists at the Max Planck Society\" for a discussion of the importance of foreign scientists in Germany's research system).\n\nTable 3-25 NSF and Census Bureau estimates of foreign-born individuals in S&E occupations, by education level: Selected years, 1999\u00ad2005\n(Percent)\n\n2003\n\n2005\n\nEducation\n\n1999 NSF/SRS 2000 Census\n\nCensus American Census American\n\nSESTAT\n\n5% PUMS NSF/SRS SESTAT Community Survey Community Survey\n\nAll college educated .....................\n\n15.0\n\n22.4\n\n22.5\n\n25.0\n\n25.5\n\nBachelor's .................................\n\n11.3\n\n16.5\n\n16.3\n\n18.8\n\n19.1\n\nMaster's ....................................\n\n19.4\n\n29.0\n\n29.0\n\n32.0\n\n32.7\n\nDoctorate ..................................\n\n28.7\n\n37.6\n\n35.6\n\n39.5\n\n41.1\n\nNSF/SRS = National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics; PUMS = Public Use Microdata Sample; SESTAT = Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System\n\nNOTES: Includes all S&E occupations other than postsecondary teachers because field of instruction not included in occupation coding for 2000 Census or American Community Survey.

Science and Engineering Labor Force\n\nForeign Scientists at the Max Planck Society\n\nIn many European countries, research institutes that are outside of formal universities play a very large role in basic research and graduate training. Research institutes often also have a major role in recruiting international scientists and engineers, very often to work in laboratories and classrooms where English is the working language. Germany's Max Planck Society is an example of this phenomenon.\nThe Max Planck Society is a nonprofit research organization mostly funded by the German government. It is a notable part of both German and global science, with a budget of just under $2 billion in 2006, and with research performed at 78 separate Max Planck Institutes. The 78 institutes are run by 260 Scientific Directors, 28% of whom (in October 2006) are foreign citizens. Hierarchically just below the Scientific Directors are approximately 4,300 staff scientists, 27% of whom are foreign citizens. However, at the junior and guest scientist level, over half of the 10,900 are foreign citizens (54%, see figure 3-59). Less than one-third of these foreign citizens are from other European Union countries, with China, Russia, the United States, and India the largest non-EU countries of citizenship.\n\nFigure 3-59 Citizenship of junior and guest scientists at Max Planck Institutes: 2005\n\nSouth/Central America 3% Other 4%\nIndia 4% U.S. 4%\n\nJapan 2%\n\nOther Asia 4%\n\nGermany 45%\n\nRussia 5%\n\nChina 6%\n\nOther Europe/ Turkey 6%\nOther EU 17%\nEU = European Union SOURCE: Max Planck Society, Division of International Relations.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n3-60). Among foreign-born S&E degree holders who entered the United States before 1980, only 20% of doctorate holders and 23% of bachelor's degree holders had their highest degree from a foreign school. These percentages increase for more recent entry cohorts of immigrants. It should be noted that some portion of the increase in the most recent entry years reflects immigrants who entered during those years but have not yet had sufficient time to complete an American degree.\n\nTable 3-27 Share of college-educated, foreign-born individuals in United States holding foreign degrees, by education level: 2003\n(Percent)\n\nHighest degree\n\nHighest degree Any foreign\n\nfrom foreign university\n\nschool\n\ndegree\n\nAll degree levels ...\n\n41.4\n\n54.8\n\nBachelor's .........\n\n47.9\n\n49.7\n\nMaster's ............\n\n26.8\n\n58.6\n\nProfessional ......\n\n49.5\n\n58.5\n\nDoctorate ..........\n\n36.3\n\n78.6\n\nForeign secondary\nschool\n69.2 65.8 74.2 63.3 93.0\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, National Survey of College Graduates, 2003, Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), http:// sestat.nsf.gov.\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nCitizenship and Visa Status of Foreign-Born Scientists and Engineers in the United States\nThe length of time for foreign scientists and engineers to earn U.S. citizenship affects both their decision to come to the United States and their subsequent decision to stay. As shown in figure 3-61, only about half of foreign S&E degree holders who entered the United States in 1991 and remained in 2003 had obtained citizenship. Citizenship status may particularly affect the supply of S&T talent available to segments of the U.S. economy that can hire only citizens: the federal government and private companies engaged in defense and other classified research.\nThe length of time before acquiring citizenship is not necessarily because of a lack of interest on the part of the foreign-born scientists and engineers. Consider a hypothetical case of a bachelor's-level engineer who enters the United States with a student F visa to pursue a doctorate, who spends 6 years completing the doctorate, followed by 2 years in a postdoc position, and then is hired by an employer for a permanent job on a temporary work visa. The employer applies for a permanent work visa for their new worker, who receives it 2 years after starting work. Now, 10 years after entering the United States, a 5-year waiting period begins after receiving a permanent visa, before the engineer can apply for citizenship. The engineer applies soon after becoming eligible, and after 1 year, becomes a U.S. citizen, 16 years after entry to the United States.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nFigure 3-60 Foreign-born S&E degree holders with highest degree from foreign institution, by year of entry to United States: 2003\nPercent\n100\n\n80\n\n60 Bachelor's\nAll degrees 40\n\nMaster's\n\n20 Doctorate\n\n0 Pre1980\n\n1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 Year of entry\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), 2003, http://sestat.nsf.gov.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 3-53\nThe importance of temporary visas is also shown in figure 3-60. Five years after entry to the United States, half of the foreign born with S&E degrees are still on temporary visas. Among those who have been in the United States for 10 years, 12% are on some form of temporary visa.\nTemporary Work Visas In recent years, policy discussion has focused on the use of\nvarious forms of temporary work visas by foreign-born scientists. Many newspaper and magazine stories have been written about the H-1B visa program, which provides visas for up to 6 years for individuals to work in occupations mostly requiring at least a bachelor's degree. A wide variety of skilled workers use H-1B visas; those in computer occupations have represented at peak levels a little over half, and at lowest level a little less than one-quarter, of new H-1B visas issued.\nOver two-thirds of the slightly more than 110,000 recipients of H-1B visas in 2006 are in S&T occupations (figure 3-62). A large portion of the remainder are either in closely related fields such as medicine and health (5%) or have occupational titles that often mask the S&T expertise required, such as college and university education (8%) and various managerial, administrative, and professional and technical occupations (13%).\nIn 2006, 51% of new H-1B recipients were in computerrelated occupations, including 48% in the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services occupational category of \"occupations in systems analysis and programming,\" which includes many S&E occupations, such as computer scientist,\n\nFigure 3-61 Distribution of foreign-born S&E degree holders, by citizenship/visa status and year of entry to United States: 2003\n\nTemporary visa\n\nPermanent visa\n\nPercent\n\nU.S. citizen\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0 Pre- 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 1980\nNOTE: Although some data on foreign-born S&E degree holders available through 2003, data after 1999 exclude many individuals with foreign degrees.

This actually represents an increase in recent years (from a low of 25% in 2002) in the proportion of new H-1B visas going to computer-related occupations. In 2006, 44% of those receiving new H-1B visas in computer-related occupations had master's degrees, and a little more than 1% had doctoral degrees.\nAn important change to the H-1B visa program took effect on October 1, 2003: the annual ceiling on admissions fell from 195,000 to 65,000 because of the expiration of legislation that had allowed the additional visas. Universities and academic research institutions are exempt from this ceiling in their own hiring, and in 2005 an additional 20,000 exemptions from the H-1B quotas were added for students receiving master's degrees or doctorates from U.S. schools. However, even with these extra allowances, the H-1B visa ceiling constrains the use of foreign scientists and engineers by private industry for R&D located in the United States. It also makes it more difficult for foreign students to stay in the United States after their studies, because long delays in the visa process usually makes it impractical to be directly hired with a permanent work visa without first being a temporary worker. For FY 2008, the ceiling on H-1B visas was reached in the first day that applications were accepted.\nScientists and engineers may also receive temporary work visas through intracompany transfer visas (L-1 visas), highskilled worker visas under the North American Free Trade Agreement (TN-1 visas, a program previously primarily for Canadians, which granted full access for Mexican professionals in 2004), work visas for individuals with outstanding abilities (O-1 visas), and several smaller programs. In addition, temporary visas are used by researchers who may also be students (F-1 and J-1 visas) or postdocs, and by visiting scientists (mostly J-1 visas but often H-1B visas or other categories). State Department counts of visas issued for each of these categories are shown in table 3-28. For all types of visas, the actual number of individuals using them is less\n\nTable 3-28\nTemporary visas issued in categories likely to include scientists and engineers, by visa type: FY 2006\n\nVisa type\n\nCategory\n\nVisas\n\nWork H-1B ..................\nL-1......................

For example, some individuals may have job offers from employers in more than one country, and choose not to foreclose any options until a visa is certain.\nCharacteristics of Workers Issued New H-1B Visas Education Levels. In FY 2006, 57% of new H-1B visa\nrecipients had advanced degrees, including 41% with master's degrees, 5% with professional degree, and 11% with doctorates. This degree distribution differs by occupation, with 87% holding advanced degrees in math and physical sciences occupations (47% with doctorates) and 89% in life science occupations (61% with doctorates).\nFor those with advanced degrees, it may be possible to infer the proportion without prior U.S. education by examining the number seeking to be counted against the larger quota for those with advanced degrees from U.S. schools. In FY 2006, 59% of doctorate holders, 21% of professional degree holders, and 52% of master's degree holders indicated on their H-1B applications that their degree was from a U.S. school. This both documents the use of the H-1B visa as a way for graduates of U.S. schools to continue their careers in the United States, and the importance of the H-1B in bringing the foreign educated to the United States.\nH-1B Country of Citizenship. H1-B visa recipients have a diverse set of citizenships, with a large representation of Indian citizens overall and Chinese citizens among those holding doctorates (figures 3-63 and 3-64). Across all recipients of new H-1B visas in FY 2006, 54% were Indian citizens,\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 3-55\n\nfollowed by 9% for China, and 3% each for Canada,17 South Korea, and the Philippines. Among the 12,500 doctorate holders receiving new H-1B visas, 32% were Chinese citizens, followed by 13% for India, 7% for South Korea, 5% for Canada, and 3% each for Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan. Most doctorate holders coming from countries with large university systems had low rates of claiming a U.S. degree, for example, the United Kingdom (21%), Germany (28%), Canada (29%), France (30%), and Japan (31%). In contrast, 71% of doctorate holders from China and 59% of\n\ndoctorate holders from India claimed advanced U.S. degrees on their visa applications.\nH-1B Salaries. Salaries paid to new recipients of H-1B temporary work visas are shown in table 3-29 by occupation group and level of degree. These starting salary figures, taken from final visa application forms sent to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, are different from, and generally higher than, H-1B salaries that have been previously reported based on applications from firms to the Department of Labor,\n\nFigure 3-63 Country of citizenship for new recipients of U.S. H-1B temporary work visas: 2006\n\nOther countries 20%\n\nMexico 1% Germany 1% Pakistan 1% Taiwan 1%\nUK 2% Japan 2% Philippines 3%\nSouth Korea 3%\nCanada 3%\nChina 9%\n\nIndia 54%\n\nUK = United Kingdom SOURCE: Citizenship and Immigration Services, special tabulations.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nFigure 3-64 Country of citizenship for new recipients of U.S. H-1B temporary work visas holding doctorates: FY 2006\n\nOther 26%\n\nChina 32%\n\nFrance 2% Turkey 2% Taiwan 2%\nRussia 2% Japan 3% UK 3% Germany 3%\nCanada 5%\n\nIndia 13% South Korea 7%\n\nUK = United Kingdom SOURCE: Citizenship and Immigration Services, special tabulations.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nTable 3-29 Average annual salary of new recipients of H-1b temporary work visas, by occupation and degree: FY 2006\n(Dollars)\n\nOccupation\n\nAll degree levels Bachelor's Master's Professional Doctorate\n\nComputer-related occupations .........................................

The relatively low average salaries for doctorate holders in the life sciences may reflect the common use of H-1B visas to hire for relatively low-paid postdoc fellowships.\nVisa Applications and Rejections for Students and Exchange Visitors\nThe F-1 and J-1 visas used by students and exchange visitors have recovered from the decline experienced after FY 2001 (which ended on 30 September 2001). In FY 2006, student visa applications for the first time exceeded the previous 2001 high, and visa-rejection rates were below those experienced by applicants in FY 2001 (20.1% versus 22.9% rejections in 2001) (table 3-30). Relatively few potential students are formally rejected because of security issues, but U.S. law also requires student visa applicants to prove that they are unlikely to want to stay in the United States after the completion of their studies. In addition to reductions in the rejection rate, applications for student visas are likely to have been favorably affected by the rapid growth of demand for university education elsewhere in the world, by rising incomes in East and South Asia, and by the declines in the value of the U.S. dollar (which reduces the cost of a U.S. education for foreign students).\nStay Rates for U.S. Doctoral Degree Recipients With Temporary Visas\nHow many foreign students who receive S&E doctorates from U.S. schools remain in the United States? According to a report by Michael Finn (2007) of the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, 65% of 2000 U.S. S&E doctoral degree recipients with temporary visas remained in the United States in 2005. This is up from a 61% 5-year stay rate found in 2003 (figure 3-65). The 5-year stay rate has been increasing for S&E doctorate recipients from a wide number of countries.\n\nTable 3-30 Initial applications for student/exchange visitor visas: FY 2001\u00ad06\n\nStudent (F-1)\n\nExchange visitor (J-1)\n\nRefused\n\nRefused\n\nYear\n\nApplications (%) Applications (%)\n\n2001........... 380,385\n\n22.9 275,959\n\n5.1\n\n2002........... 322,644\n\n27.4 270,702\n\n6.2\n\n2003........... 288,731\n\n25.3 275,335\n\n7.8\n\n2004........... 282,662\n\n22.6 274,789\n\n7.4\n\n2004........... 282,662\n\n22.6 274,789\n\n7.4\n\n2005........... 333,161\n\n19.8 311,728\n\n5.8\n\n2006........... 385,596\n\n20.1 349,598\n\n5.9\n\nNOTE: Application counts and refusal rates adjusted for reapplications and appeals by same individual.\n\nSOURCE: Department of State, Immigrant Visa Control and Reporting Division, administrative data.\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nFigure 3-65 Five-year stay rates for U.S. S&E doctorate recipients with temporary visas, by place of origin: 1992\u00ad2005\nPercent 100\nChina\nIndia\n80\n\n60\n\nUK\n\nCanada\n\nAll countries\n\n40 Germany\nBrazil 20\n\nTaiwan Japan\n\nSouth Korea\n\n0\n1987/88 1990/91 1992/93 1994/95 1996 (1992) (1995) (1997) (1999) (2001)\n\n1998 2000 (2003) (2005)\n\nUK = United Kingdom\nNOTE: Year of observation in parentheses.\nSOURCE: Finn M, Stay Rates of Foreign Doctorate Recipients from U.S. Universities: 2005, Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (2007).\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nHighly Skilled Migrants in OECD Countries Estimates of international migrants residing in OECD\ncountries were made by Docquier and Marfouk (2004) using data from the various national censuses.

With 1.4 million tertiary-educated citizens in other OECD countries, the United Kingdom has the largest high-skilled diaspora. Although originally used to describe much less voluntary dispersals of population in history, high-skilled diaspora is increasingly used to describe networks of contact and information flow that form among the internationally mobile portion of a country's nationals.

Although the most dramatic growth has occurred in the IT sector, other areas of S&E employment also have recorded strong growth over the past two decades.\nIn general, labor market conditions for individuals with S&E degrees improved during the 1990s. (These conditions have always been better than the conditions for college graduates as a whole.) However, engineering and computer science occupations have been unusually affected by the recent recession, causing the unemployment rate for individuals in all S&E occupations to reach a 20-year high of 4.6% in 2003 before dropping to 3.0% in 2004. Labor market conditions\n\nfor new doctoral degree recipients have been good according to most conventional measures; for example, the vast majority of S&E doctoral degree holders are employed and doing work relevant to their training. However, these gains have come in the nonacademic sectors. In nearly all fields, the proportion of doctoral recipients that obtain tenure-track academic positions, long a minority, has continued to decline. The globalization of the S&E labor force continues to increase as the location of S&E employment becomes more internationally diverse and S&E workers become more internationally mobile. These trends reinforce each other as R&D spending and business investment cross national borders in search of available talent, as talented people cross borders in search of interesting and lucrative work, and as employers recruit and move employees internationally. Although these trends appear most strong in the high-profile international competition for IT workers, they affect every S&T area.\nThe rate of growth of the S&E labor force may decline rapidly over the next decade because of the aging of individuals with S&E educations, as the number of individuals with S&E degrees reaching traditional retirement ages is expected to triple. If this slowdown occurs, the rapid growth in R&D employment and spending that the United States has experienced since World War II may not be sustainable.\nThe growth rate of the S&E labor force would also be significantly reduced if the United States becomes less successful in the increasing international competition for immigrant and temporary nonimmigrant scientists and engineers. Many countries are actively reducing barriers to high-skilled immigrants entering their labor markets at the same time that entry into the United States is becoming somewhat more difficult. Despite this, many recent statistics suggest that the United States is still an attractive destination for many foreign scientists and engineers.\nSlowing of the S&E labor force growth would be a fundamental change for the U.S. economy, possibly affecting both technological change and economic growth. Some researchers have raised concerns that other factors may even accentuate the trend (NSB 2003). Any sustained drop in S&E degree production would produce not only a slowing of labor-force growth, but also a long-term decline in the S&E labor force.\nNotes\n1. Once a decade, NSF's surveys include non-S&E degree holders, and this was true in 2003.\n2. Although BLS labor force projections do a reasonable job of forecasting employment in many occupations (see Alpert and Auyer 2003), the mean absolute percentage error in the 1988 forecast of employment in detailed occupations in 2000 was 23.2%.\n3. Since their growth rate projection is near the overall average, engineers and physical scientists are classified as having average growth by BLS.\n\n\f3-58 \n\nChapter 3. Science and Engineering Labor Force\n\n4. Not all analyses of changes in earnings are able to control for level of skill. For example, data on average earnings within occupation over time may not be a good indicator of labor market conditions if the average experience level was to fall for workers in a rapidly growing occupation.\n5. Many comparisons using Census Bureau data on occupations are limited to looking at \"nonacademic S&E occupations\" because the occupation of \"postsecondary teacher\" has not been broken out into subjects in most recent census surveys.\n6. Specifically presented here are coefficients from linear regressions using the 2003 Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT) data file of individual characteristics on the natural log of reported full-time annual salary as of October 2003.\n7. \"Underrepresented ethnic group\" as used here includes individuals who reported their race as black, American Indian/Alaska Native, or other, or who reported Hispanic ethnicity.\n8. In the regression equation, this is the form: age, age2, age3, age4; years since highest degree (YSD), YSD2, YSD3, YSD4.\n9. Included were 20 dummy variables for NSF/SRS SESTAT field-of-degree categories (out of 21 S&E fields; the excluded category in the regressions was \"other social science\").\n10. Variables added here include 34 SESTAT occupational groups (excluding \"other non-S&E\"), whether individuals said their jobs were closely related to their degrees, whether individuals worked in R&D, whether their employers had fewer than 100 employees, and their employers' U.S. census region.\n11. Variables added here include dummy variables for marriage, number of children in the household younger than 18, whether the father had a bachelor's degree, whether either parent had a graduate degree, and citizenship. Also, sex, nativity, and ethnic minority variables are included in all regression equations.\n12. Although the formal job title is often postdoctoral fellowship or research associate, many different titles are used. This chapter will generally use the shorter, more commonly used, and best understood name, \"postdoc.\" A postdoc has traditionally been defined as a temporary position, after completion of a doctorate, taken primarily for additional training--a period of advanced professional apprenticeship.\n13. Some part of the citizen and permanent resident postdoc population in the fall of 2005 will not be counted even in SDR. Excluded are summer 2005 graduates who may be in postdoc positions in the fall of 2005, doctorate holders who may have left the country before April 2006, and those who have foreign doctorates.\n14. A 2003 survey conducted by the Sigma Xi honor society, which was nonrepresentative and likely to undercount foreign postdocs, found that 46% of responding postdocs had received their doctorate from a non-U.S. institution.\n\n15. Respondents also had to be under age 76 and resident in the United States in April 2006. In a similar retrospective question on the 1995 SDR, 25% of those earning their doctorates before 1964 reported having had postdocs.\n16. Bureau of Economic Analysis R&D employment data are counts of full-time and part-time employees that devote the majority of their time to R&D activities.\n17. Although Canadians with university degrees can use the easier-to-obtain TN visa to work in the United States, many prefer to seek H-1Bs, perhaps in part because TN visa holders are not permitted to apply for permanent resident (\"green card\") status. There is no preferential path to a permanent work visa for H-1B holders; they are not forbidden to seek a green card.\nGlossary\nEU-25: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the UK.\nHigh-skilled diaspora: Increasingly used to describe networks of contact and information flow that form among the internationally mobile portion of a country's nationals.

Reflecting initially and primarily increased research spending on health and more recently development spending in the areas of defense and counterterrorism, the federal share of R&D funding is projected at 28% of the R&D funding total in 2006.\nU.S. R&D is dominated by development expenditures, largely performed by the business sector, with most basic research conducted at universities and colleges.\n In 2006, the United States performed an estimated $62 billion of basic research, $75 billion of applied research, and $204 billion of development.\n Universities and colleges historically have been the largest performers of basic research in the United States and now account for more than half (56% in 2006) of the nation's basic research. Most (59%) of the nation's basic research is federally funded.\n The development of new and improved goods, services, and processes is dominated by the business sector, which funded 83% and performed 90% of all U.S. development in 2006. The federal government funded most of the remaining development performed in the United States, mostly on defense-related activities.\n\nLocation of R&D Performance\nR&D is geographically concentrated, and states vary significantly in the types of research performed within their borders.\n In 2004, more than three-fifths of U.S. R&D took place in 10 states. California alone accounted for more than onefifth of the $300 billion of R&D that could be attributed to one of the 50 states or the District of Columbia.\n Federal R&D accounts for 85% of all R&D in New Mexico, the location of the two largest federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) in terms of R&D performance, Los Alamos National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories.\n More than 70% of all R&D performed in the United States by computer and electronic products manufacturers is located in California, Massachusetts, Texas, and Illinois.\n The R&D of chemicals manufacturing companies is particularly prominent in three states, accounting for 66% of New Jersey's, 54% of Pennsylvania's, and 50% of Connecticut's business R&D. Together these states represent more than 40% of the nation's R&D in this sector.\nBusiness R&D\nBusiness sector R&D reached a new high in 2005.\n R&D performed by the business sector in the United States reached $226.2 billion in 2005 and is projected to have increased to $242 billion in 2006.\n Since a peak of 4.2% in 2001, the average R&D-to-sales intensity of companies performing R&D in the United States has varied between 3.5% and 3.9%; in 2005 it was 3.7%.\n Six industrial sectors account for more than three-fourths of all industrial R&D. The aggregate R&D intensity for these industries was 7.7% in 2005; for all other industries, the aggregate R&D intensity was 1.3%.\nFederal R&D\nIn the president's 2008 budget submission, the federal government is slated to set aside $138 billion for R&D, amounting to 12.8% of its discretionary budget.\n Federal agencies are expected to obligate $113 billion for R&D support in FY 2007. The seven largest R&Dfunding agencies (each with expected R&D obligations of more than $1 billion) account for 96% of total federal R&D.\n\n\f4-6 \n\nChapter 4. Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nDefense-related R&D dominates the federal R&D portfolio.\n The largest R&D activity in the FY 2008 budget is defense, with a proposed budget authority of more than $82 billion (mostly on development), or about 60% of the entire federal R&D budget ($138 billion).\n In FY 2008, the Department of Defense (DOD) requested a research, development, testing, and evaluation budget of $78 billion.\n Health accounts for the largest share of nondefense R&D support; 52% of the proposed FY 2008 nondefense R&D budget was for health-related programs.\nFederal and State R&D Tax Credits\nBoth the federal and state governments use business tax credits to promote R&D.\n Federal R&D tax credit claims reached an estimated $5.5 billion in 2003, involving just under 10,400 corporate tax returns, compared with the all-time high of $7.1 billion in 2000.\n At least 32 states offered credits for company-funded R&D in 2006. The first such credit was enacted by Minnesota in 1982, only a year after the federal research and experimentation credit was enacted. Since then, the number of states offering a research credit has increased gradually.\nInternational R&D Comparisons\nR&D is performed and funded primarily by a small number of developed nations.\n In 2002 (the latest year of available data), global R&D expenditures totaled at least $813 billion, of which 45% was accounted for by the two largest countries in terms of R&D performance, the United States and Japan.\n The R&D performance of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, which accounted for $657 billion in 2002, grew to $726 billion in 2004. The G-7 countries performed more than 83% of OECD R&D in 2004. Outside of the G-7 countries, South Korea is the only country that accounted for a substantial share of the OECD total.\n More money was spent on R&D activities in the United States in 2004 than in the rest of the G-7 countries combined.\n In 2004, Brazil performed an estimated $14 billion of R&D, and India performed an estimated $21 billion in 2000, making it the seventh largest country in terms of R&D in that year, ahead of South Korea.\n China had the fourth largest expenditures on R&D in 2000 ($45 billion), which increased in 2005 to an estimated $115 billion. Given the lack of R&D-specific ex-\n\nchange rates, it is difficult to draw conclusions from these absolute R&D figures, but the country's nearly decadelong, steep ramp-up of R&D expenditures appears unprecedented in the recent past.\nIndustrial firms account for the largest share of total R&D performance in each of the G-8 countries and most OECD countries.\n No one industry accounted for more than 16% of total business R&D in the United States; most other countries display much higher industry concentrations.\n The pharmaceuticals industry accounts for 20% or more of business R&D in Denmark, the United Kingdom, Belgium, and Sweden. Among OECD countries, only the Netherlands and Japan report double-digit concentration of business R&D in the office, accounting, and computing machine industry.\n Service-sector R&D has risen from 9% of all business R&D in 1993 to 15% in 2003 for European Union countries.\nR&D intensity indicators, such as R&D/gross domestic product (GDP) ratios, also show the developed, wealthy economies well ahead of lesser-developed economies.\n Overall, the United States ranked seventh among OECD countries in terms of reported R&D/GDP ratios. Israel (not an OECD country), devoting 4.7% of its GDP to R&D, led all countries, followed by Sweden (3.9%), Finland (3.5%), and Japan (3.2%).\n In the United States, the slowdown in GDP growth in 2001 preceded the decline of U.S. R&D in 2002. This resulted in U.S. R&D/GDP ratios of 2.7% in 2001 (a recent high) and 2.6% in 2002 and thereafter. The U.S. R&D/ GDP ratio was an estimated 2.57% in 2006.\n Most non-European (non-OECD) countries invest a smaller share of their economic output in R&D than do OECD members. For example, all Latin American countries for which such data exist have R&D/GDP ratios at or below 1%.\n Despite its growing investment in R&D, China reports an R&D/GDP ratio of just 1.3% for 2005.\nR&D by Multinational Corporations\nR&D by affiliates of foreign companies located in the United States increased faster than overall U.S. industrial R&D.\n Affiliates of foreign companies located in the United States performed $29.9 billion in R&D expenditures in 2004, little changed from 2003. However, between 1999 and 2004, R&D by these affiliates increased faster than overall industrial R&D in the United States (2.1% on an annual average rate basis after adjusting for inflation, compared with 0.2%).\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 4-7\n\nMajor developed economies accounted for the majority of overseas R&D expenditures by U.S. multinational corporations (MNCs), although certain Asian emerging markets increased their share.\n Foreign affiliates of U.S. MNCs performed $27.5 billion in R&D abroad in 2004 after adjusting for inflation, up $4.7 billion, or 17.4%, from 2003. Affiliates located in Europe represented slightly more than two-thirds of the 2004 increase. Indeed, the share of this region rebounded from an all-time low of 61% in 2001 to 66% in 2004.\n Concurrently, foreign affiliates of U.S. MNCs have increasingly engaged in R&D activities in Asian emerging markets. Within the Asia-Pacific region, Japan's share decreased from 64% in 1994 to 35% in 2004, even though it remains the largest host of U.S.-owned R&D in the region. By contrast, the R&D shares of foreign affiliates located in China and Singapore increased over this period.\n R&D expenditures by affiliates located in India doubled from $81 million in 2003 to $163 million in 2004, pushing their share within this region to 3.3%.\nInternational Trade in R&D-Related Services\nTrade in research, development, and testing (RDT) services is a relatively new indicator of international knowledge and technology flows.\n In 2005, exports of RDT services reached $10.1 billion, compared with imports of $6.7 billion, resulting in a trade surplus of $3.4 billion.\n\n International transactions in RDT services are available for two major categories: trade among independent or unaffiliated companies and trade among affiliates of MNCs (affiliated trade). Affiliated RDT trade has been larger than unaffiliated trade since 2001, when the former became available for the first time. The prominence of affiliated trade in business services, particularly R&D-related services, may reflect advantages of internally managing, exploiting, and protecting complex or strategic transactions involving proprietary technical information.\nFederal Technology Transfer\nR&D performed at federal laboratories, whether run by federal agencies themselves or by contractors, represents a key source for knowledge and technologies.\n Federal technology transfer activities and metrics reflect the variety of agency missions, R&D organization and funding structures (e.g., intramural versus extramural laboratories), the character of R&D activities, and the characteristics of potential downstream technologies or industrial users.\n The Department of Energy and DOD had the largest shares of inventions disclosed and patents, whereas the National Institutes of Health/Food and Drug Administration had the largest share of new invention licenses, according to available data for FY 2005.\n\n\f4-8 \n\nChapter 4. Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nIntroduction\nChapter Overview\nAs nations seek to develop knowledge-based aspects of their economies, science, engineering, and related technological activities are recognized as key drivers. Furthermore, industrial R&D has become increasingly interconnected financially, geographically, and functionally across a number of dimensions, including performing, funding, and user sectors; scientific disciplines; and business functions.\nInnovation--the introduction of new goods, services, or processes in the marketplace--builds on new knowledge and technologies, contributes to national competitiveness and government agencies' missions, and furthers social welfare. A distinction is made between R&D and the implementation or commercialization of the resulting knowledge. R&D expenditures indicate the priority given to advancing science and technology (S&T) relative to other public and private goals. For example, R&D must compete for funding with other activities supported by discretionary government spending, from education to energy to national defense. In the private sector, R&D and other innovation investments are also subject to cost-benefit analyses, including productivity and organizational issues, and are increasingly linked to broader strategic business goals.\nThe continued policy relevance of the national innovation landscape, which includes, for example, R&D, education, tax incentives, and intellectual property protection, is reflected in the American Competitiveness Initiative (OSTP 2006) and in the recently enacted America COMPETES Act (Public Law 110\u00ad69). In support of these efforts, Dr. John H. Marburger III, the president's S&T adviser, has challenged the policy, research, and statistical community to develop better data, models, and tools for understanding the U.S. scientific and engineering enterprise in its global context by advancing the science of science policy. Concurrently, international bodies such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) Working Party of National Experts on Science and Technology Indicators and the United Nations Statistical Commission have engaged in several research and methodological activities to improve metrics, including work leading to new or updated statistical manuals on innovation, globalization, national economic accounts, and services trade.\nBecause the organizations that fund R&D shape how it is performed and what kinds of innovations nations ultimately produce, this chapter focuses on financial inputs and flows. The chapter also presents trends in R&D performance, notably R&D by industry and the federal government. Where data permit, the chapter includes comparisons with other countries. Analyses of the R&D activities of multinational corporations (MNCs) point out the importance of this growing interconnectedness. Global R&D and related international investments still are concentrated in a few developed countries or regions. However, during the past decade, cer-\n\ntain developing markets have increased their national R&D expenditures and have become hosts of R&D by MNCs from the United States and other advanced economies.\nThe chapter also introduces new indicators of industrial knowledge flows in terms of U.S. international trade in R&Drelated services. Transactions in these services represent the convergence of two recent trends in industrial S&T: an increase in R&D performance in the service sector and an increase in external and overseas links in innovation activities.\nChapter Organization\nThis chapter is organized into seven sections that examine trends in R&D domestic and international expenditures and collaborative technology activities. The first section provides an overview of national trends in R&D performance and R&D funding. The second analyzes data on the location of R&D performance in the United States. The third and fourth sections focus on the respective roles of business enterprises and the federal government in the R&D enterprise. The latter section also includes indicators on federal and state tax incentives for industrial R&D.\nInternational R&D trends within nations and MNCs are discussed in the fifth and sixth sections, respectively. The former includes total and nondefense R&D spending; ratios of R&D to gross domestic product (GDP) in various nations; international R&D funding by performer and source; the allocation of R&D efforts among components (basic research, applied research, and development); and international comparisons of government R&D priorities. The sixth section presents data on R&D by U.S. MNCs and their overseas affiliates and by affiliates of foreign companies in the United States. Data include R&D expenditures by investing or host countries and their industrial focus, and R&D employment.\nThe last section summarizes available information on external technology sourcing and collaborative R&D activities across R&D-performing sectors, including domestic contract R&D, international trade in R&D services, business technology alliances, and federal technology transfer.\nNational R&D Trends\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF) estimated that expenditures for R&D conducted in the United States would grow to $340 billion in 2006, continuing a pattern of growth largely uninterrupted since 1953, when these data were first collected (see sidebar, \"Definitions of R&D\"). As points of reference, U.S. R&D first exceeded $100 billion in 1984, $200 billion in 1997, and $300 billion in 2004. After adjusting for inflation, total R&D increased a projected 2.3% between 2005 and 2006, following an increase of 4.5% between 2004 and 2005.1 These recent growth rates in R&D are in line with the average annual growth rates over the past two decades and are largely driven by increases in R&D expenditures in the business sector (figure 4-1).\nOfficial U.S. R&D data are derived by adding up the R&D expenditures for all sectors of the economy for which\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\nDefinitions of R&D\nR&D. According to international guidelines for conducting research and development surveys, R&D, also called research and experimental development, comprises creative work \"undertaken on a systematic basis to increase the stock of knowledge--including knowledge of man, culture, and society--and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications\" (OECD 2002, p. 30).\nBasic research. The objective of basic research is to gain more comprehensive knowledge or understanding of the subject under study without specific applications in mind. Although basic research may not have specific applications as its goal, it can be directed in fields of present or potential interest. This is often the case with basic research performed by industry or mission-driven federal agencies.\nApplied research. The objective of applied research is to gain knowledge or understanding to meet a specific, recognized need. In industry, applied research includes investigations to discover new scientific knowledge that has specific commercial objectives with respect to products, processes, or services.\nDevelopment. Development is the systematic use of the knowledge or understanding gained from research directed toward the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including the design and development of prototypes and processes.\nR&D plant. R&D plant includes the acquisition of, construction of, major repairs to, or alterations in structures, works, equipment, facilities, or land for use in R&D activities. U.S. statistics include separate tabulations for R&D plant (NSF/SRS 2007b), which are not generally available in comparable international R&D statistics.\nBudget authority. Budget authority is the authority provided by federal law to incur financial obligations that will result in outlays.\nObligations. Federal obligations represent the dollar amounts for orders placed, contracts and grants awarded, services received, and similar transactions during a given period, regardless of when funds were appropriated or payment was required.\nOutlays. Federal outlays represent the dollar amounts for checks issued and cash payments made during a given period, regardless of when funds were appropriated or obligated.\nFor an annotated compilation of definitions of R&D by U.S. statistical agencies, tax statutes, accounting bodies, and other official sources, see NSF/SRS (2006b).\n\n 4-9\n\nexpenditures can be reasonably estimated. Generally these figures only include expenditures on projects that are recognized as R&D and that are separately budgeted and tracked by organizations, and therefore they do not represent the total expenditures on R&D and innovation in the economy. For example, the General Electric Company notes in its 2005 annual report that its R&D expenditures for 2005 were $3.4 billion, according to the definition of R&D required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. However, the report goes on to state, \"For operating and management purposes, we consider amounts spent on product and services technology to include our reported R&D expenditures, but also amounts for improving our existing products and services, and the productivity of our\n\nFigure 4-1 National R&D, by performing and funding sectors, 1953\u00ad2006\n\nConstant 2000 dollars (billions)\n\n250 Industry\n\nFederal government\n\n200\n\nU&C\n\nNonprofit organizations\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0 1953\n250\n200\n\n1961 1966 1971 1976 1981 1986 1991 1996 2001 2006 Performing sector\nIndustry Federal government Other\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0 1953\n\n1961 1966 1971 1976 1981 1986 1991 1996 2001 2006 Funding sector\n\nU&C = universities and colleges\nNOTE: Federal performers of R&D include federal agencies and federally funded research and development centers.

Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nUnmeasured R&D\n\nThe estimates of U.S. R&D presented in this volume are derived from surveys of organizations that have historically performed the vast majority of R&D in the United States. However, to evaluate U.S. R&D performance over time and in comparison with other countries, it is necessary to gauge how much R&D is going unmeasured in the United States. The following are indicators of unmeasured R&D performance in the United States:\n To reduce cost and respondent burden, U.S. industrial R&D estimates are derived from a survey of R&Dperforming companies with five or more employees. There are no estimates of R&D performance for companies with fewer than five employees.\n The activity of individuals performing R&D on their own time (and not under the auspices of a corpora-\n\ntion, university, or other organization) is similarly not included in official U.S. R&D statistics.\n Social science R&D is excluded from U.S. industrial R&D statistics, and R&D in the humanities is excluded from U.S. academic R&D statistics. Other countries include both in their national statistics, making their national R&D expenditures relatively larger when compared with those of the United States.\n R&D performed by state and local governments in the United States is not currently estimated for national statistics. A new survey of state R&D is currently being collected by NSF and the Census Bureau.\nAlthough NSF estimates the R&D performance of nonprofit organizations, a nonprofit R&D survey has not been fielded since 1998.\n\nRecent Developments in Innovation-Related Metrics\n\nThis sidebar reports on recent or ongoing initiatives aimed at advancing innovation-related measures. As noted earlier, a distinction is made between R&D and the subsequent implementation or commercialization of the resulting knowledge.\nNSF Workshop: Advancing Measures of Innovation\nNSF held a workshop focused on innovation metrics during the summer of 2006, \"Advancing Measures of Innovation: Knowledge Flows, Business Metrics, and Measurement Strategies.\" The workshop was driven by several considerations, including the challenge by Dr. John H. Marburger III, the president's S&T adviser, for better data, models, and tools for understanding the U.S. S&E enterprise (Marburger 2005a, b). A number of strategies for data development were discussed at the workshop: survey-based methods, data linking and data integration, nonsurvey-based methods (such as mining of administrative data), and using case studies and qualitative data. The sense of the workshop was that these diverse strategies are not mutually exclusive and can be pursued productively in parallel or in combination. For workshop presentations and a summary report, see NSF/SRS (2006a).The OECD's Blue Sky Forum, which followed the NSF workshop, discussed the development of new and better indicators of science, technology, and innovation and developed a synthesis of findings toward an agenda for the next decade. For more information about the Blue Sky Forum, see OECD (2006a).\nFederal Initiatives Supporting New Metrics\nScience of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP) is an NSF research initiative started in the fall of 2006. The initiative is expected to develop the foundations of an\n\nevidence-based platform from which policymakers and researchers may assess the nation's S&E enterprise, improve their understanding of its dynamics, and predict its outcomes. The research, data collection, and community development components of SciSIP's activities will: (1) develop theories of creative processes and their transformation into social and economic outcomes; (2) improve and expand science metrics, datasets, and analytical tools; and (3) develop a community of experts on SciSIP. Additional information is available at NSF/SBE (2007).\nIn addition to the OSTP interagency taskforce described on page 4-11, the Department of Commerce (DOC) established the Measuring Innovation in the 21st Century Economy Advisory Committee to \"study metrics on effectiveness of innovation in various businesses and sectors, and work to identify which data can be used to develop a broader measure of innovation's impact on the economy.\" The committee held its first public meeting in February 2007. See DOC (2007) for further details.\nLastly, the America COMPETES Act (Public Law 110\u00ad69) enacted in the summer of 2007 establishes, among other measures, a President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness. In addition to policy monitoring and advice, the Council's duties include \"developing a process for using metrics to assess the impact of existing and proposed policies and rules that affect innovation capabilities in the United States\" as well as \"developing metrics for measuring the progress of the Federal government with respect to improving conditions for innovation, including through talent development, investment, and infrastructure development. . . .\" For the complete text of the America Competes Act, see Library of Congress (2007).\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 4-11\n\nplant, equipment, and processes. On this basis, our technology expenditures in 2005 were $5.2 billion\" (GE 2006). For a description of other activities not captured in official U.S. R&D statistics, see sidebar, \"Unmeasured R&D.\"\nThe U.S. innovation system comprises a diverse set of organizations, each with its own goals, priorities, and capabilities. These organizations include small businesses, MNCs, federal and state agencies, universities and colleges, research hospitals, and others. Because R&D often involves significant transfers of resources between organizations and sectors, the sections below analyze R&D both in the context of who is performing the R&D as well as in the context of who is funding the R&D.\nInnovation--the introduction of new goods, services, or business processes in the marketplace--builds on new knowledge and technologies and contributes to national competitiveness and other social goals (NRC 2005b; OECD 2005; OSTP 2006). However, technology-based innovation activities include, but are not limited to, R&D. In response to the growing importance and complexity of these issues, the National Science and Technology Council, under the auspices of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), has formed an Interagency Task Group on Science of Science Policy. The task group is analyzing federal and international efforts in science and innovation policy, identifying tools needed for new indicators and charting a strategic road map to improve theoretical frameworks, data, models, and methodologies. See also sidebar, \"Recent Developments in Innovation-Related Metrics.\"\n\nPerformers of R&D\nExpenditures on R&D reported by R&D-performing organizations reflect the level of effort, in financial terms, expended on the creation of new knowledge and the use of that knowledge to devise new and improved S&T applications. However, these data in and of themselves do not indicate how successful or effective these efforts are, only how much money is spent on them. For a methodology to measure the role of R&D in economic growth, see sidebar, \"The BEA/ NSF R&D Satellite Account.\"\nBusiness Sector In dollar terms, the business sector performed an esti-\nmated 71% ($242 billion of a total of $340 billion) of U.S. R&D in 2006 (figure 4-2). The business sector's share of U.S. R&D peaked in 2000 at 75%, but following the stock market decline and subsequent economic slowdown of 2001 and 2002, the business activities of many R&D-performing firms were curtailed. As a result, business R&D declined by 2% per year in real terms between 2000 and 2003, and the industry share fell to 69% of the U.S. R&D total. Subsequently, R&D expenditures in the business sector grew by more than 3% per year in real terms between 2003 and 2006 and now account for 71% of the U.S. R&D total.\nOf the estimated $242 billion of business sector R&D expenditures in 2006, $23 billion was funded by the federal government (table 4-1). Before the late 1960s, the federal government was the primary source of funding for business R&D, but it now accounts for less than 10% of all R&D performed by businesses in the United States. This decline in\n\nThe BEA/NSF R&D Satellite Account: R&D and Economic Growth\n\nSatellite accounts are supplementary estimates of the GDP and related measures that provide greater detail or alternative measurement concepts without changing the core accounts. In particular, the purpose of the R&D satellite account is to consider R&D as an economic investment or capital (i.e., capitalizing R&D). This is an ongoing project involving NSF's Division of Science Resources Statistics, the agency responsible for official U.S. statistics on R&D expenditures, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), the agency responsible for the U.S. national economic accounts. This activity is one of several interagency efforts aimed at improved measures of intangibles and their economic role (Jorgensen, Landefeld, and Nordhaus [2006]; Okubo et al. [2006]). Current plans call for the incorporation of R&D capital into the National Income and Product Accounts' core accounts in 2013, based on the concepts developed in the satellite account.\nMeasuring R&D as capital investment recognizes its long-term benefits much as investments in physical assets such as highways and machinery. As a newly recognized component of investment, R&D has a direct impact on\n\nGDP because business expenditures for R&D become part of economic output, instead of being treated as an expense. According to these estimates, capitalizing R&D increases the level of GDP in current dollars by an average of 2.5% per year from 1959 to 2002 (Okubo et al. 2006). In terms of GDP growth, R&D capital would account for about 4.5% of real GDP growth during that same period. During the more recent period 1995\u00ad2002, R&D investment would account for about 6.5% of growth. By comparison, according to BEA, business investment in commercial and all other types of buildings accounted for slightly more than 2% of real GDP growth between 1959 and 2002.\nFurther research topics include the measurement of the overall impact, both direct and indirect, of R&D activity on productivity. The indirect effects of R&D activity on productivity include spillovers that accrue when the benefits to the economy as a whole are larger than the benefits to the private owners of R&D. Additional research topics include the incorporation of international R&D flows and several methodological improvements. For more information, see BEA (2007a).\n\n\f4-12 \n\nChapter 4.

See appendix tables 4-3 and 4-5.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\nfederal R&D funding as reported by businesses differs from the trend in R&D data collected from federal agencies. (For details on this discrepancy, see sidebar, \"Tracking R&D: Gap Between Performer- and Source-Reported Expenditures\" later in the chapter.)\nUniversities and Colleges The next largest sector in terms of R&D performance is the\nacademic sector. Universities and colleges performed almost $47 billion of R&D in 2006, one-fifth the amount performed by businesses in the United States. However, universities and colleges perform more than half (56%) the nation's basic research. (See the discussion of R&D by character of work that appears later in this chapter.) Universities and colleges rely much more than businesses on external sources of R&D funding. In 2006, slightly less than 20% of university and col-\n\nlege R&D was funded by institutional funds, and more than 61% was funded by the federal government (table 4-1). In recent years, the amount of R&D performed by universities and colleges has grown faster than in any other sector of the U.S. economy. Academic R&D grew at an average annual 7.4% real rate between 2000 and 2003, but more recently this growth slowed to 1.9% per year in real terms between 2003 and 2006. See chapter 5 for a more detailed discussion of trends in academic R&D expenditures.\nFederal Agencies and FFRDCs Federal agencies and federally funded research and de-\nvelopment centers (FFRDCs) accounted for an estimated 11% of the R&D performed in the U.S. in 2006.2 Although the amount of R&D performed by these organizations is small compared to the U.S. business sector, the $37 billion in R&D expenditures at these organizations exceeds the total national R&D expenditures of every country in the world other than China, Germany, and Japan. These expenditures also do not include the sizable investments the U.S. government has made in R&D infrastructure and equipment. The federal government often maintains research facilities and conducts research projects that would be too costly or risky for a single company or university to undertake. Largely as a result of increased defense spending following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, expenditures for R&D conducted by federal agencies and FFRDCs grew at the rapid rate of almost 6.6% per year in real terms between 2000 and 2003. In terms of total U.S. R&D, this growth helped offset the decline in business sector R&D during that period. Since 2003, the real R&D expenditures at federal agencies and FFRDCs have remained basically flat. Federal R&D is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.\nR&D Funding\nThe funding for R&D conducted by organizations in the United States can come from a variety of sources, including the organizations' own funds as well as contracts and grants from other organizations. Although data on the flows of R&D funding within sectors (such as between two companies) is limited, data on the flows of R&D between sectors indicate that financial relationships between organizations play a significant role in the U.S. R&D system. In 2006, an estimated 20% of U.S. R&D ($67 billion) was funded by an organization in a different sector than the performing sector. Most of this intrasector R&D funding comes from the federal government, which funds significantly more R&D than it conducts in its own laboratories and FFRDCs (table 4-1). Unlike the federal government, most businesses spend their R&D budgets on either internal R&D projects or for contract R&D performed by other businesses (see the section entitled \"Technology Linkages\"). Less than 2% of business R&D funding flows to universities and other nonprofit organizations, although industry funded approximately 5% of all universities' 2006 R&D.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 4-13\n\nTable 4-1 U.S. R&D expenditures, by funding and performing sectors: 2006\n(Millions of current dollars)\n\nPerforming sector\n\nSource of funds\n\nAll expenditures\n\nAll sources Industry Federal government U&C Other nonprofit institutions (% distribution)\n\nR&D ...................................................

See appendix table 4-3.\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nFederal R&D Funding In 2006, the federal government is projected to have fund-\ned $94 billion of R&D as reported by performers of R&D, accounting for 28% of all R&D funding in the United States (figure 4-2). The federal government was once the foremost sponsor of the nation's R&D, funding as much as 67% of all U.S. R&D in 1964 (figure 4-3). The federal share first fell below 50% in 1979 and dropped to a low of 25% in 2000. The declining share of federal R&D funding is most evident in the business sector. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, more than half of the nation's business R&D was funded by the federal government, but by 2000, less than 10% of business R&D was federally funded. The decades-long trend of federal R&D funding shrinking as a share of the nation's total R&D reversed between 2000 and 2004. During this period, private investment slowed and federal spending on R&D expanded, reflecting initially and primarily increased research spending on health, and, more recently, development spending in the areas of defense and counterterrorism. By 2004, the federal share of the nation's R&D funding had increased to 30%. The federal share of R&D funding has since declined to an estimated 28% in 2006, as noted earlier.\nNonfederal R&D Funding R&D funding from nonfederal sources reached an esti-\nmated $246 billion in 2006. Business sector funding dominates nonfederal R&D support. Besides performing the majority of U.S. R&D, the business sector also is the largest source of R&D funding in the United States, providing 66% ($223 billion) of total R&D funding in 2006 (figure 4-2). The business sector's share of national R&D funding first surpassed the federal government's share in 1980. From 1980 to 1985, industrial support for R&D, in real dollars, grew at an average annual rate of almost 8%. This growth\n\nwas maintained through both the mild 1980 recession and the more severe 1982 recession (figure 4-1). Between 1985 and 1994, growth in R&D funding from industry was slower, averaging only 3% per year in real terms. However, from 1994 to 2000, industrial R&D support grew in real terms by more than 9% per year. This rapid growth rate came to a halt following the downturn in both the market valuation and economic demand for new technology during the first years of the 21st century. Between 2000 and 2002, industrial R&D support declined by more than 3% per year in real terms, but\n\nFigure 4-3 National R&D expenditures, by funding sector: 1953\u00ad2006\nPercent\n80\n\nFederal government\n\nIndustry\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\nOther\n\n0 1953\n\n1961 1966 1971 1976 1981 1986 1991 1996 2001 2006\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, National Patterns of R&D Resources (annual series).

Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nbetween 2002 and 2006, it grew by almost 3% per year in real terms.\nAlthough R&D funding from other nonfederal sectors, namely academic and other nonprofit institutions and state and local governments, is small in comparison to federal and business R&D spending, it has grown rapidly. Between 1986 and 2006, funding from these sectors grew almost 6% per year in real terms, faster than R&D funding from either the federal or business sectors. Most of these funds went to research performed within the academic sector.\nUnlike some other countries, the United States does not currently measure the amount of domestic R&D that is funded by foreign sources. However, data on investments of foreign MNCs provide some indication of this activity for the industrial sector (see the section entitled \"R&D by Multinational Corporations\" later in this chapter).\nR&D by Character of Work\nR&D encompasses a wide range of activities, from fundamental research in the physical, life, and social sciences; to research addressing critical issues such as global climate change, energy efficiency, and disease; to the development of new and improved goods and services (from razor blades to fighter jets to business software). Because these activities are so diverse, it is helpful to group them into categories when analyzing R&D expenditures. Historically, the most common set of categories used to classify R&D are basic research, applied research, and development. The categories have been criticized by some economists and policymakers as being overly simplistic and reinforcing the idea that innovation is a linear process beginning with basic research, followed by applied research and development, and ending with the production and diffusion of technology. Although alternative models have been proposed, they have not been widely adopted by policymakers because of a lack of consensus about them and/or a lack of official data robust enough to support them.3 Despite the difficulties in classifying specific R&D projects, the categories presented here help characterize the motivation, expected time horizons, outputs, and types of investments associated with R&D expenditures.\nIn 2006, the United States performed an estimated $62 billion of basic research, $75 billion of applied research, and $204 billion of development. As a share of all estimated 2006 R&D expenditures, basic research represented 18%, applied research represented 22%, and development represented 60% (figure 4-4). Historically, the federal government has been the primary source of support for basic research. In 2006, federal funding accounted for 59% of U.S. basic research (figure 4-4). Moreover, in 2006 the federal government funded 64% of the basic research performed by universities and colleges, the largest performers of basic research in the United States. Industry devoted only a projected 4% of its total R&D support to basic research in 2006 (figure 4-5). The reason for industry's relatively small contribution to basic research is\n\nFigure 4-4 National R&D, by character of work, and basic research, by funding and performing sectors: 2006\nBasic research 18%\n\nDevelopment 60%\n\nApplied research 22%\n\nNational R&D, by character of work\n\nOther 24%\n\nIndustry 17%\n\nFederal government\n59%\n\nBasic research, by funding sector\n\nOther nonprofit 12%\n\nIndustry 15%\n\nFederal government\n16%\n\nU&C 56%\nBasic research, by performing sector\nU&C = universities and colleges NOTES: National R&D expenditures projected at $340 billion in 2006.

However, firms may have other reasons for performing basic research above and beyond immediate commercial demands. For example, a company that supports basic research could boost its human capital (by attracting and retaining academically motivated scientists and engineers) and strengthen its innovative capacity (i.e., its ability to absorb external scientific and technological knowledge). The industries that invest the most in basic research are those whose new products are most directly tied to recent\n\nadvances in S&T, such as the pharmaceuticals industry and the scientific R&D services industry.\nThe business sector spends more than four times as much on applied research as on basic research and accounts for more than half of U.S. applied research funding. In 2006, industry invested an estimated $44 billion in applied research funding, 59% of the U.S. total. Examples of industries that perform a relatively large amount of applied research are the chemicals industry, the aerospace industry (largely financed by the Department of Defense (DOD)), and the R&D services industry (encompassing many companies whose business is licensing technology). Although most of the federal investment in basic research supports research at universities and colleges, the majority of federally funded applied research is performed by federal agencies and FFRDCs.\nDevelopment expenditures totaled an estimated $204 billion in 2006, representing the majority of U.S. R&D expenditures. The development of new and improved goods, services, and processes is dominated by industry, which funded 83% of all U.S. development in 2006 ($169 billion). The federal government funded most of the remaining development performed in the United States, totaling 16% or $33 billion. Most federal development spending is defense related. The federal government generally invests in the development of such products as military aircraft, for which it is the only consumer. The business sector conducts even more development than it funds, accounting for 90% of all development conducted in the United States in 2006. Universities, colleges, and other nonprofit institutions conducted less than 2% of U.S. development. The balance of development is conducted by federal agencies and FFRDCs.\nThe OECD notes that in measuring R&D, possibly the greatest source of error \"is the difficulty of locating the cutoff point between experimental development and the related activities required to realize an innovation\" (OECD 2002). Most definitions of R&D set the cut-off point to be when a particular product or process reaches the point of \"market readiness.\" At this point, the defining characteristics of the product or process (at least for manufacturers, if not also for services) are substantially set, and further work is primarily aimed at developing markets, doing preproduction planning, or getting a production or control system working smoothly.\nLocation of R&D Performance\nR&D performance is geographically concentrated in the United States. More than 50% of U.S. R&D is performed in only seven states.4 Although R&D expenditures are concentrated in relatively few states, patterns of R&D activity vary considerably among the top R&D-performing locations (appendix table 4-23). (For a broader range of indicators of state-level S&E activities, see chapter 8.)\n\n\f4-16 \n\nChapter 4. Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nDistribution of R&D Expenditures Among States\nIn 2004, the 20 highest-ranking states in R&D expenditures accounted for 85% of U.S. R&D expenditures, whereas the 20 lowest-ranking states accounted for 5%. (A complete list of state rankings is provided in appendix table 4-24.) The top 10 states accounted for more than three-fifths of U.S. R&D expenditures in 2004 (table 4-2). California alone accounted for approximately one-fifth of the $300 billion U.S. R&D total, exceeding the next highest state (Michigan) by more than a factor of three.5 States vary significantly in the size of their economies because of differences in population, land area, infrastructure, natural resources, and history. Consequently, state variations in R&D expenditure levels may simply reflect differences in economic size or the nature of R&D efforts. One way to control for the size of each state's economy is to measure each state's R&D level as a percentage of its share of GDP. Like the ratio of national R&D to GDP discussed later in this chapter, the proportion of a state's GDP devoted to R&D is an indicator of R&D intensity. Some of the states with the highest R&D to GDP ratios include New Mexico and Maryland, home to major government research facilities; Massachusetts, home to a number of large research universities and a thriving high-technology industry; and Michigan, home to the major auto manufacturers. A list of states and corresponding R&D intensities can be found in appendix table 4-24.\n\nSector Distribution of R&D Performance by State\nAlthough leading states in total R&D tend to be well represented in each of the major R&D-performing sectors, the proportion of R&D performed in each of these sectors varies across states. Because business sector R&D accounts for 71% of the U.S. R&D total that can be distributed among states, it is not surprising that 9 of the top 10 states in terms of total R&D performance are also in the top 10 in terms of industry R&D (table 4-2). Connecticut, 10th in terms of business sector R&D, replaced Maryland among the leading 10 states for total R&D. University-performed R&D accounts for only 15% of the U.S. total, but it is also highly correlated with the total R&D performance in a state. Only New Jersey and Washington, among the top 10 total R&D state locations, were not among the top 10 locations for university R&D performance. North Carolina and Ohio rounded out the academic R&D top 10.\nThere is less of a relationship between federal R&D performance (both intramural and FFRDC) and total R&D, as federal R&D is more geographically concentrated than the R&D performed by other sectors.6 The top four states in terms of federal R&D (Maryland, California, New Mexico, and Virginia), along with the District of Columbia, account for two-thirds of all federal R&D performance. Federal R&D accounts for 85% of all R&D in New Mexico, the location of the two largest FFRDCs in terms of R&D performance, Los Alamos National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories. Federal R&D accounts for about 50% of all R&D performed in Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia, reflecting the concentration of federal facilities and adminis-\n\nTable 4-2 Top 10 states in R&D performance, by sector and intensity: 2004\n\nAll R&Da\n\nSector ranking\n\nR&D intensity (R&D/GDP ratio)\n\nRank State\n\nAmount (current $millions)\n\nIndustry\n\nU&C\n\nFederal intramural and FFRDCb\n\nState\n\nR&D/ GDP GDP (current (%) $billions)\n\n1 California 2 Michigan 3 Massachusetts 4 Maryland 5 Texas 6 New York 7 New Jersey 8 Illinois 9 Washington 10 Pennsylvania\n\n59,607 16,722 15,987 14,341 14,266 13,113 12,460 11,300 10,936 10,813\n\nCalifornia\n\nCalifornia\n\nMaryland\n\nNew Mexico\n\n8.01\n\nMichigan\n\nNew York\n\nCalifornia\n\nMaryland\n\n6.26\n\nMassachusetts Texas\n\nNew Mexico\n\nMassachusetts\n\n5.17\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMaryland\n\nVirginia\n\nMichigan\n\n4.60\n\nTexas\n\nPennsylvania District of Columbia Rhode Island\n\n4.36\n\nWashington\n\nMassachusetts Massachusetts\n\nWashington\n\n4.33\n\nNew York\n\nIllinois\n\nIllinois\n\nConnecticut\n\n4.29\n\nIllinois\n\nNorth Carolina Washington\n\nCalifornia\n\n3.93\n\nPennsylvania Michigan\n\nAlabama\n\nNew Hampshire\n\n3.22\n\nConnecticut\n\nOhio\n\nTennessee\n\nDistrict of Columbia 3.06\n\n63.9 229.2 309.5 363.4\n42.2 252.4 183.9 1,515.5\n51.7 77.8\n\nFFRDC = federally funded research and development center; GDP = gross domestic product; U&C = universities and colleges\n\naIncludes in-state total R&D performance of industry, universities, federal agencies, FFRDCs, and federally financed nonprofit R&D. bIncludes costs associated with administration of intramural and extramural programs by federal personnel and actual intramural R&D performance.\n\nNOTE: Rankings do not account for margin of error of estimates from sample surveys.\n\nSOURCES: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, National Patterns of R&D Resources (annual series); and Bureau of Economic Analysis, Gross Domestic Product by State (2006), http://www.bea.gov/regional/gsp, accessed 25 August 2007.\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 4-17\n\ntrative offices within the national capital area. Federal R&D also represents 33% of the R&D performed in Alabama and West Virginia. The Departments of Energy (DOE) and Agriculture (USDA) account for the largest shares of federal intramural R&D performance in West Virginia, whereas DOD's Redstone Arsenal laboratories and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) George C. Marshall Space Flight Center, both in Huntsville, account for most of Alabama's federal R&D activity. Looking across all states, federal R&D represents 12% of the distributed U.S. total.\nIndustrial R&D in Top States\nThe types of companies that carry out R&D vary considerably among the 10 leading states in industry-performed R&D (table 4-3). This reflects regional specialization or clusters of industrial activity. For example, in Michigan, the motor vehicles industry accounted for 74% of industrial R&D in 2005, whereas it accounted for only 7% of the nation's total industrial R&D.\nThe computer and electronic products manufacturing industries perform 19% of the nation's total industrial R&D, but they perform a larger share of the industrial R&D in Massachusetts (41%), Texas (38%), Illinois (38%), and California (33%). These states have clearly defined regional centers of high-technology research and manufacturing: Cambridge and Route 128 in Massachusetts; the Silicon Hills of Austin, Texas; Champaign County in Illinois; and Silicon Valley in California. More than 70% of R&D performed in the United States by computer and electronic products companies in 2005 was located in these four states, representing 14% of all business R&D nationwide.\n\nThe R&D of chemicals manufacturing companies is particularly prominent in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut, all of which host robust pharmaceutical and chemical industries. According to the American Chemistry Council, together these states host more than 1,600 chemical manufacturing establishments and rank among the top 20 in chemical industry employment (American Chemistry 2007). These companies accounted for 66% of New Jersey's, 54% of Pennsylvania's, and 50% of Connecticut's business R&D in 2005. Together these three states represented more than 40% of the nation's R&D in this sector.\nThe R&D services sector, which consists largely of biotechnology companies, contract research organizations, and early-stage technology firms, is even more concentrated geographically, with California and Massachusetts accounting for more than 40% of R&D in this sector. The companies in this sector maintain strong ties to the academic sector and often are located near large research universities (Stuart and Sorenson 2003).\nThe R&D performance of small companies (defined as having from 5 to 499 employees) is also concentrated geographically.7 Nationally, small companies perform 18% of the nation's total business R&D, but in California, Massachusetts, and New York these companies perform between 19% and 22% of the states' business R&D. About 39% of the R&D performed in the United States by companies in this category is performed in these three states. Overall, these companies performed 7% of the nation's R&D in 2005.\n\nTable 4-3 Top 10 states in industry R&D performance and share of R&D, by selected industry: 2005\n(Percent)\n\nState\n\nIndustryperformed R&D (current $millions)\n\nChemicals\n\nComputer and electronic products\n\nComputerrelated services\n\nR&D services\n\nMotor vehicles\n\nCompanies with 5\u00ad499 employees\n\nAll states..................... 226,159\n\n19.0\n\nCalifornia................. 50,683\n\n11.2\n\nMichigan ................. 16,752\n\n9.5\n\nMassachusetts........ 13,342\n\n13.2\n\nNew Jersey ............. 13,214\n\n65.7\n\nTexas....................... 12,438\n\n4.7\n\nWashington .............\n\n9,736\n\n5.5\n\nIllinois ......................\n\n9,712\n\n18.9\n\nNew York.................\n\n9,474\n\n28.4\n\nPennsylvania ...........\n\n8,846\n\n54.2\n\nConnecticut ............\n\n7,885\n\n50.3\n\n19.2 L\n\n13.5\n\n7.5\n\n33.2\n\n15.0\n\n10.7\n\n2.3\n\nD\n\n1.5\n\n41.1\n\nD\n\n11.1\n\n5.7\n\n3.5\n\n5.6\n\n37.4\n\n18.3\n\n6.3\n\n5.6\n\nD\n\n6.3\n\n37.4\n\n5.1\n\n1.7\n\n6.6\n\n18.8\n\n3.7\n\n6.9\n\n6.0\n\n8.3\n\n3.5\n\n2.4\n\n4.0\n\n7.1 L\n\n17.9\n\nD\n\n21.8\n\n74.3\n\n6.2\n\nD\n\n22.3\n\n0.2\n\n13.1\n\n0.5\n\n16.1\n\n0.7\n\n11.7\n\n2.4\n\n12.4\n\nD\n\n18.5\n\n0.4\n\n15.4\n\n0.1\n\n11.5\n\nL = lower-bound estimate; D = suppressed to avoid disclosure of confidential information\n\nNOTES: Rankings do not account for margin of error of estimates from sample surveys.

Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nBusiness R&D\nBusinesses perform R&D with a variety of objectives in mind, but most business R&D is aimed at developing new and improved goods, services, and processes. For most firms, R&D is a discretionary expense. R&D does not directly generate revenue in the same way that production expenses do, so it can be trimmed with little impact on revenue in the short term. Firms attempt to invest in R&D at a level that maximizes future profits while maintaining current market share and increasing operating efficiency. R&D expenditures, therefore, indicate the level of effort dedicated to producing future products and process improvements in the business sector. By extension, they may reflect firms' perceptions of the market's demand for new and improved technology.\nR&D performed by the business sector reached $226 billion in 2005. The federal government funded 9.7% ($22 billion) of this total, and company funds and other private sources financed the remainder (appendix tables 4-19, 4-20, and 4-21). These estimates are derived from the NSF-Census Bureau's annual Survey of Industrial Research and Development, which collects financial data related to R&D activities from companies performing R&D in the United States. These data provide a basis for analyzing R&D investment of the business sector and are the official source for U.S. business R&D estimates (see sidebar, \"Industry Classification\").\nIn addition to absolute levels of R&D expenditures, another key company S&T indicator in the business sector is R&D intensity, a measure of R&D relative to production in a company, industry, or sector. Many ways exist to measure R&D intensity, including the ratio of R&D to GDP discussed earlier. The measure used most frequently is the ratio of company-funded R&D to net sales.8 This statistic provides a way to gauge the relative importance of R&D across industries and among firms in the same industry. The average R&D intensity of companies performing R&D in the United States reached its highest reported level of 4.2% in 2001; R&D performance remained steady compared with the previous year, while sales of R&D-performing companies declined. Since then, R&D intensity has varied between 3.5% and 3.9%; in 2005, it was 3.7%.\nLargest R&D Industries\nAlthough all industries benefit from advances in S&T, industries perform different amounts of R&D.9 Some industries have relatively low R&D intensities (0.5% or less), such as the utilities industry10 and the finance, insurance, and real estate industries. Appendix table 4-22 provides data on company-funded R&D to net sales ratios for an array of industries.11 Six industries, four manufacturing and two services industries, account for 75% of company-funded business R&D and 95% of federally funded business R&D (table 4-4).12\n\nComputer and Electronic Products The computer and electronic products manufacturing\nsector accounts for the largest amount of business R&D performed in the United States (table 4-4). Industries in this sector include companies that manufacture computers, computer peripherals, communications equipment, and similar electronic products, and companies that manufacture components for such products. The design and use of integrated circuits and the application of highly specialized miniatur-\nIndustry Classification\nAs a result of classification conventions, interpretation of industry-level R&D data is not always straightforward. Initially, each company sampled in NSF's Survey of Industrial Research and Development is assigned to a single industry according to payroll data for the company,* and each is requested to report its R&D expenditures for the entire company. These expenditures are assigned to the previously classified single industry. This classification scheme reasonably categorizes most companies into industries closely aligned with their primary business activities. However, for diversified companies that perform R&D in support of a variety of industries, any single assigned industry is only partly correct. And in some cases, the industry assigned based on payroll data is not directly related to a company's R&D activities.\nIt is important to assess the relationships between industries as well as the business structure within industries when analyzing R&D data. For example, most of the federally funded R&D reported in the navigational, measuring, electromedical, and control instruments industry is performed by large defense contractors that also produce aerospace products. And investigations of survey microdata revealed that most of the R&D classified into the trade industry represents the activities of manufacturing firms that have integrated their supply chains and brought their warehousing, sales, and marketing efforts in-house. Consequently, beginning with the 2004 cycle of the survey, the assigned industry classification of companies in selected industries (such as wholesale trade) and also companies that most influence the overall R&D performance estimates is subjected to manual review and potential reclassification. Wherever possible, this report includes industry-level data that results from this new method of industry classification.\n* Details on how companies are assigned initial industry codes based on payroll in the NSF Survey of Industrial Research and Development can be found at NSF/SRS (2002b). For information on the current industry classification process, see NSF/SRS (2004b).\n The impact of the new industry classification methodology is detailed in NSF/SRS (2007d).\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 4-19\n\nization technologies are common elements in the production processes of the computer and electronic products sector.\nIn 2005, these industries performed at least $43.5 billion of R&D, or 19% of all business R&D.13 Companies and other nonfederal sources funded almost this entire R&D. The focus of the R&D in this sector is on development, with less than 25% of company-funded R&D devoted to basic and applied research. Two of the more R&D-intensive industries, communications equipment and semiconductor manufacturing, are included in this group. Both devoted more than 11% of sales to R&D in 2005.\nChemicals The chemicals industry performed an estimated $43.0\nbillion of R&D in 2005. Like the computer and electronic products industries, relatively little of the R&D in the chemicals industry is federally funded. In terms of R&D performance, the largest industry within the chemicals subsector is pharmaceuticals and medicines. In 2005, pharmaceutical companies performed $34.8 billion of company-funded R&D, representing 81% of nonfederal R&D funding of the chemicals sector.\nThe Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), an industry association that represents the country's leading research-based pharmaceutical and\n\nbiotechnology companies, annually surveys its members for information about their R&D. In 2005, PhRMA estimated that its members invested $31.4 billion in R&D performed in the United States, which was 19.2% of domestic sales and 15.8% of global sales (PhRMA 2006a).14 According to PhRMA, members' domestic R&D investment supports continuing R&D on projects that originated in their own laboratories, but 25% supports R&D on products licensed from other companies (notably biotechnology companies), universities, or the government (PhRMA 2006b). In NSF's Survey of Industrial Research and Development, companies that predominantly license their technology rather than manufacture finished products are often classified in the scientific R&D services industry. Therefore, a sizable amount of biotechnology R&D that serves the pharmaceutical industry is reported in the R&D services sector (see the section entitled \"R&D Services\").\nComputer-Related Services Industries associated with software and computer-related\nservices (such as data processing and systems design) performed approximately $30.5 billion of company-funded R&D in 2005. The R&D of these industries, combined with that of the computer and electronic products manufacturers discussed earlier, accounted for 33% of all industrial\n\nTable 4-4 R&D and domestic net sales, by selected business sector: 2004 and 2005\n(Millions of current dollars)\n\nAll R&D\n\nFederal R&D\n\nCompany R&D\n\nAll R&D/sales\n\nDomestic net sales\n\nratio (%)\n\nSector\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2004\n\n2005 2004 2005\n\nAll industries .................. 208,301 226,159 20,266 21,909 188,035 204,250 5,601,729 6,119,133 3.7 3.7\n\nHighlighted sectors ....... 163,102 L 174,970 L 19,122 L 20,867 L 143,980 154,102 2,205,651 2,268,642 7.4 7.7\n\nComputer and\n\nelectronic productsa.... 40,964 43,520 L 273\n\n1,057 L 40,691 42,463 506,103 472,330 8.1 9.2\n\nChemicals...................... 39,224 L 42,995\n\n154 L 169\n\n39,070 42,826 595,292 624,344 6.6 6.9\n\nComputer-related\n\nservicesb ..................... 28,117 L 30,518\n\n410 L 578\n\n27,707 29,939 166,545 213,574 16.9 14.3\n\nAerospace and defense\n\nmanufacturingc............ 23,567 L 24,926 L 14,343 L 13,998 L 9,224 10,928 228,018 227,271 10.3 11.0\n\nR&D servicesd................ 15,620 16,986 3,942\n\n5,065\n\n11,678 11,921\n\n66,614 84,637 23.4 20.1\n\nAutomotive\n\nmanufacturinge............ 15,610 L 16,025\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\n15,610 16,025 643,079 646,486 2.4 2.5\n\nAll other industries......... 45,199 L 51,189 L 1,144 L 1,042 L 44,055 50,148 3,396,078 3,850,491 1.3 1.3\n\nL = lower-bound estimate; NA = not available\n\naIncludes all nonfederal R&D and domestic net sales for the navigational, measuring, electromedical, and control instruments industry.

Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nR&D in 2005. As computing and information technology became more integrated with every sector of the economy, the demand for services associated with these technologies boomed.\nBetween 1987 and 2005, the R&D of companies providing these services grew dramatically. In 1987, when an upper-bound estimate of software and other computer-related services R&D first became available, companies classified in the industry group, \"computer programming, data processing, other computer-related, engineering, architectural, and surveying services,\" performed $2.4 billion of companyfunded R&D, or 3.8% of all company-funded industrial R&D. In 2005, the company-funded R&D of these industries (excluding engineering and architectural services) accounted for 14.7% of all company-funded industrial R&D, and these companies accounted for 3.5% of domestic sales of R&D-performing companies (table 4-5).15 Although the R&D activities of computer-related services companies have grown dramatically, this group is not the sole performer of software development R&D in the United States. In fact, companies in almost every industry report expenditures for software development R&D.\nAerospace and Defense Manufacturing Although it is common to refer to the \"defense industry,\"\nthere is no such category in the industry classification system used by the federal government. Companies performing the majority of DOD's extramural R&D are classified in the aerospace products and parts industry; other transportation equipment industries; and the navigational, measuring, electromedical, and control instruments manufacturing industry. To approximate the cost of defense-related R&D, one can focus on the federally supported R&D performed by these industries. In 2005, these industries reported performing $14.0 billion of federal R&D, about two-thirds of all federal industrial R&D expenditures (table 4-4).16 This accounts for more than half of the $25.0 billion the \"defense industry\" as a whole spent on R&D, including both federal and nonfederal sources of funds. (See the section entitled \"Federal R&D\" later in this chapter for further discussion of defense R&D.)\nR&D Services Companies in the business of selling S&E R&D services\nto other companies or licensing the results of their R&D are generally classified in the architectural, engineering, and related services industry, or the scientific R&D services industry. Companies in this sector perform the majority of the federal R&D that is not performed by aerospace and defense manufacturing firms; $5.1 billion in 2005. Despite the significant amount of government-sponsored R&D performed by this sector, R&D services companies increasingly rely on nonfederal sources of R&D financing. The R&D performed by companies in the R&D services sector and funded by company and other nonfederal sources has grown from $5.8 billion in 1997 to $11.9 billion in 2005.17 Because much of\n\nthe R&D reported by these companies also appears in their reported sales figures, the R&D intensity of the R&D services sector is particularly high (20% in 2005).\nAlthough the companies in this sector and their R&D activities are classified as nonmanufacturing, many of the industries they serve are manufacturing industries. For example, many biotechnology companies in the R&D services sector license their technology to companies in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. If a research firm was a subsidiary of a manufacturing company rather than an independent contractor, its R&D would be classified as R&D in a manufacturing industry. Consequently, growth in R&D services may, in part, \"reflect a more general pattern of industry's increasing reliance on outsourcing and contract R&D\" (Jankowski 2001).

Because IRI member companies carry out a large amount of industrial R&D in the United States, the results from these surveys help identify broad trends in corporate R&D strategies. Dr. Jules J. Duga, a senior analyst at the Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, Ohio, notes (in a personal communication) that the IRI survey\n. . . provides a reasonable overview of the actions that are being taken by industry. Although the internal analysis of IRI survey results does not delve deeply into the driving forces for the stated planning, the overall results are certainly a reflection of industrial response to markets, federal actions, and approaches for the most effective means for acquiring technological assets. Although there have been changes in the type of membership pattern that is represented within IRI, and there are similar changes in the character of the respondents, the IRI survey provides a long-term envelope of planning and practices as applied to R&D, and results in there being the raw material for qualitative and semi-quantitative longitudinal studies that well serve the objectives of industrial science policy analyses. One of the major characteristics of the IRI survey is that for all intents and purposes the questionnaire has maintained the same format for many years, thus permitting the development of a long-term analytical framework with a minimum of disruptions. The analysis of the responses to individual questions, as well as the introduction of a so-called \"sea change\" indicator, provides a series\n\nof snapshots of postures. Over the past few years, efforts have been directed toward viewing clusters of responses to questions that have internal conceptual linkages. Such an approach has provided a means for developing broader pictures of the driving forces and action items that are influencing industrial R&D strategy.\nThe most recent survey, administered during the summer of 2006, suggests that many companies continue to shift the focus of their R&D spending away from directed basic research and the support of existing business to new business projects (IRI 2007). This reported shift in R&D priorities also is reflected in how responding companies intend to spend their R&D budgets. IRI survey respondents reported the following plans for 2007:\n Increase total company expenditures on R&D\n Increase hiring of new graduates\n Increase outsourcing of R&D to other companies\n Increase outsourcing for university R&D and federal laboratories\n Increase participation in alliances and joint R&D ventures\n Increase licensing of technology to and from other companies\n Increase acquisition of technological capabilities through mergers and acquisitions\nOverall, these strategic moves are consistent with responses suggesting increased R&D budgets. Responding companies are increasing R&D spending to support existing lines of business as well as new business projects and are leveraging their R&D spending through joint R&D ventures and grants/contracts for university R&D. (For more information, see the section entitled \"Technology Linkages.\")\n\nAutomotive Manufacturing The sixth largest business sector in terms of R&D is auto-\nmotive manufacturing. Companies in this industry reported performing $16.0 billion of company-funded R&D in 2005, accounting for 7.1% of all such R&D performed by businesses in the United States. At one time, this industry played a larger role in U.S. business R&D; for example, in 1959, automotive manufacturing accounted for as much as 16.2% of all company-funded and -performed R&D.\nIn 2004, nine companies in the automotive manufacturing industry reported R&D expenditures of more than $100 million, representing more than 80% of the industry's R&D. In most industries, large companies perform more R&D than small companies, but in the automotive manufacturing industry, the distribution of R&D is even more skewed toward\n\nlarge companies, with the R&D activities of General Motors, Ford, and DaimlerChrysler dominating the sector. In their reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, these companies reported R&D expenses of $21.1 billion in 2004 (see sidebars, \"Trends in R&D for Industrial Research Institute Members\" and \"R&D Expenses of Public Corporations\").18\nFederal R&D\nIn the president's 2008 budget submission, the federal government is slated to invest $138 billion in R&D, amounting to 12.8% of its discretionary budget (i.e., that part of the annual federal budget that the president proposes and Congress debates and sets). The government supports S&T\n\n\f4-22 \n\nChapter 4. Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nR&D Expenses of Public Corporations\n\nMost firms that make significant investments in R&D track their R&D expenses separately in their accounting records and financial statements. The annual reports of public corporations often include data on these R&D expenses. In 2004, the 25 public corporations with the largest reported worldwide R&D expenses spent $127.3 billion on R&D. The three companies that topped the list were automobile manufacturers. Ford Motor Company, DaimlerChrysler, and Toyota, together with the other four automobile manufacturers on the list, reported spending $41.0 billion on R&D (32.5% of the total for the top 25) (table 4-6). There are 10 companies in the information and communications technologies (ICT) sector that spent a total of $49.4 billion (38.8% of the total). The remaining eight companies include six pharmaceutical manufacturers and two diversified consumer product-oriented manufacturers. As Hira and Goldstein (2005) point out, although four of the five top leaders in R&D in 2004 were automobile manufacturers, which is a marked difference compared with 2000, when the top four spenders were the telecommunications giants Ericsson, Lucent, Motorola, and Nortel, \"automakers face an uncertain near-term outlook because of pressures from an increasing cost structure and the need to achieve shorter product life cycles to meet rapidly changing consumer preferences.\"\nThe top 25 companies are headquartered in seven different countries, with nine headquartered in the United States. However, the location of a company's headquarters is not necessarily the location of all its R&D activities. Most of the companies on this list have manufacturing and research facilities in multiple countries around the world. (For more information, see the section entitled \"R&D by Multinational Corporations.\")\nOverall, R&D spending for the top 25 increased 4.0% in 2004 compared with 2003. Sales for the group as a whole increased 6.8%; sales increased in the 6%\u00ad8% range for the automobile and pharmaceutical manufac-\n\nturers and ICT companies in the group, and more than 11% for the consumer product manufacturers. R&D expenditures increased for the manufacturers (pharmaceutical, 6.9%; automobile, 6.3%; and consumer products, 10.4%). However, the ICT companies, representing the sector with traditionally the highest R&D intensity, reported only a 0.1% increase.\nIt should be noted that a recent change in accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) may result in discontinuities in companies' reported R&D expenses, making it more difficult to evaluate R&D spending trends from publicly available financial data. By 2004, most large companies began following the guidelines of FASB's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, \"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,\" which requires companies to expense the fair value of all stock-based compensation.* Many high-technology companies have historically compensated their R&D employees with stock options and stock awards. This stock-based compensation may not have been reported as company expenses before these new guidelines. For example, according to Hira and Goldstein (2005), \"Microsoft's R&D spending decreased 20.5% in 2004 despite an increase in R&D employees. According to its U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings, the decrease was \"`due to lower stock-based compensation expense' [because] in 2003 the company began offering its employees stock-based compensation in lieu of options. This affected its R&D accounting significantly. . . .\" For information on how many of the largest U.S.-based corporations intended to adjust their R&D strategies and spending, see sidebar, \"Trends in R&D for Industrial Research Institute Members.\"\n* See FASB (2004); Hira and Goldstein (2005). For information about how FASB standards as they apply to U.S. firms compare and converge with the standards of the International Accounting Standards Board, see FASB (2007).\n\nthrough a number of policy measures, the most direct of which is the conduct and funding of R&D that would not, or could not, be conducted or financed in the private sector. This section presents data on such R&D activities, on the government's contribution to the U.S. R&D infrastructure, and on federal and state R&D tax credits (an indirect means of stimulating R&D in the private sector).\n\nR&D by Federal Agency\nFederal agencies are expected to obligate $113 billion for R&D support in FY 2007 (table 4-7). Although more than 25 agencies report R&D obligations, only 7 report expected R&D obligations of more than $1 billion in FY 2007. Together, these agencies account for 96% of total federal R&D. These agencies vary considerably in terms of their R&D funding, reflecting the unique mission, history, and culture of each.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 4-23\n\nTable 4-6 Top 25 R&D-spending corporations: 2004\n\nR&D rank\n\nR&D expense ($millions)\n\nSales ($millions)\n\nR&D intensity (%)\n\nCompany (country)\n\n2004 2003 2004 2003 Change (%) 2004\n\n2003\n\n2004 2003\n\nFord Motor (U.S.)...................................... 1 DaimlerChrysler (Germany) ...................... 2 Toyota Motor (Japan)................................ 3 Pfizer (U.S.)............................................... 4 General Motors (U.S.)............................... 5 Siemens (Germany) .................................. 6 Microsoft (U.S.)......................................... 7 Matsushita Electric Industrial (Japan)....... 8 GlaxoSmithKline (UK) ............................... 9 Johnson & Johnson (U.S.)........................ 10 International Business Machines (U.S.).... 11 Volkswagen (Germany)............................. 12 Intel (U.S.) ................................................. 13 Nokia (Finland).......................................... 14 Sony (Japan)............................................. 15 Samsung Electronics (South Korea)......... 16 Honda Motor (Japan) ............................... 17 Novartis (Switzerland)............................... 18 Roche Holding (Switzerland) .................... 19 Merck (U.S.).............................................. 20 AstraZeneca (UK) ..................................... 21 Nissan Motor (Japan) ............................... 22 Robert Bosch (Germany).......................... 23 Hitachi (Japan).......................................... 24 Hewlett-Packard (U.S.)............................. 25\n\n2 7,400 7,500 4 7,187 7,076 6 7,052 6,372 3 6,613 7,131 7 6,500 5,700 5 6,431 6,436 1 6,184 7,779 8 5,748 5,409 9 5,251 5,162 13 5,203 4,684 10 5,167 5,068 14 4,823 4,479 15 4,778 4,360 12 4,742 4,776 11 4,688 4,805 25 4,529 3,337 16 4,368 4,193 20 4,207 3,756 17 4,192 3,925 29 3,885 3,178 23 3,803 3,451 28 3,718 3,309 24 3,681 3,366 22 3,630 3,472 21 3,506 3,652\n\n\u00ad1.3 1.6\n10.7 \u00ad7.3 14.0 \u00ad0.1 \u00ad20.5\n6.3 1.7 11.1 2.0 7.7 9.6 -0.7 -2.4 35.7 4.2 12.0 6.8 22.2 10.2 12.4 9.4 4.5 \u00ad4.0\n\n171,652 164,196 4.3\n\n4.6\n\n180,448 173,307 4.0\n\n4.1\n\n173,254 161,517 4.1\n\n3.9\n\n52,516\n\n45,188 12.6 15.8\n\n190,812 182,005 3.4\n\n3.1\n\n95,480\n\n94,293\n\n6.7\n\n6.8\n\n39,788\n\n36,835 15.5 21.1\n\n81,377\n\n69,854\n\n7.1\n\n7.7\n\n37,655\n\n39,656 13.9 13.0\n\n47,348\n\n41,862 11.0 11.2\n\n96,293\n\n89,131\n\n5.4\n\n5.7\n\n113,004 110,705 4.3\n\n4.0\n\n34,209\n\n30,141 14.0 14.5\n\n37,176\n\n37,415 12.8 12.8\n\n66,864\n\n70,009\n\n7.0\n\n6.9\n\n77,494\n\n61,284\n\n5.8\n\n5.4\n\n80,784\n\n76,231\n\n5.4\n\n5.5\n\n28,247\n\n24,864 14.9 15.1\n\n25,742\n\n25,698 16.3 15.3\n\n23,430\n\n22,486 16.6 14.1\n\n21,426\n\n18,849 17.7 18.3\n\n80,094\n\n69,382\n\n4.6\n\n4.8\n\n50,818\n\n46,182\n\n7.2\n\n7.3\n\n84,304\n\n80,619\n\n4.3\n\n4.3\n\n79,905\n\n73,061\n\n4.4\n\n5.0\n\nUK = United Kingdom\n\nSOURCE: Institute of Electronics and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), IEEE Spectrum Top 100 R&D Spenders, Standard & Poor's data (2005), http://www. spectrum.ieee.org/dec05/2395, accessed 24 April 2007.\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nDepartment of Defense According to preliminary data, DOD will obligate $56 bil-\nlion for R&D support in FY 2007. DOD funds more R&D than any other federal agency, representing half of all federal R&D obligations. Of these funds, 89% ($50 billion) will be spent on development (figure 4-6). Most of the development funded by DOD is classified as \"major systems development\" ($44 billion), representing the cost of developing, testing, and evaluating combat systems. Industrial firms are expected to perform 74% of DOD-funded R&D in FY 2007. DOD accounts for more than 84% of all federal R&D obligations to industry in FY 2007. Federal intramural R&D and R&D performed by FFRDCs account for most of DOD's remaining R&D activity and represent 25% of its FY 2007 total.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),\nthe primary source of federal health-related R&D funding (largely through its National Institutes of Health [NIH]), will obligate the second largest amount for R&D in FY 2007 at $29 billion, representing 26% of all federal R&D obligations. In contrast to DOD, HHS will allocate most of its R&D funding ($16 billion) for basic research. In FY 2007,\n\nHHS is expected to provide universities and colleges, the primary recipients of HHS funding, with $16 billion, which represents 65% of all federal R&D funds obligated to universities and colleges (table 4-8). HHS will provide 75% ($4 billion) of all federal R&D funds obligated to nonprofit institutions. Most of these institutions are large research hospitals such as Massachusetts General Hospital and the DanaFarber Cancer Institute (NSF/SRS 2007c).\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration The third largest agency in terms of R&D support is\nNASA, with R&D obligations expected to reach more than $8 billion in FY 2007. Almost half ($4 billion) of NASA's R&D activity is in development, much of which relies on industrial performers similar to those funded by DOD. However, unlike the industrial R&D funded by DOD, the majority (55%) of that funded by NASA supports research projects (basic and applied) as opposed to development. NASA is also the primary sponsor of R&D projects at nine federal facilities (including the Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley and the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama) and one FFRDC, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, administered by the California Institute of Technology.\n\n\f4-24 \n\nChapter 4.

In FY 2007, DOE obligated 67% of its estimated $8 billion in R&D funding to these organizations. Of the 37 FFRDCs, DOE sponsored 16 and accounted for more than half of all federal R&D obligations to FFRDCs in FY 2007. Much of DOE's research requires specialized equipment and facilities that are only available at its intramural laboratories and FFRDCs. (See the section on FFRDCs later in this chapter.)\nNational Science Foundation NSF is the federal government's primary source of fund-\ning for general S&E research and is expected to fund $4 billion of R&D in FY 2007. Of these funds, 91% are for basic\n\nresearch. Unlike many other federal agencies, NSF does not operate any of its own laboratories, but instead supports scientists and engineers through their home institutions. For the most part, these home institutions are universities and colleges; NSF is the second largest federal source of R&D funds to universities and colleges and is expected to invest more than $3 billion in academic research in FY 2007.\nDepartment of Agriculture USDA is expected to fund almost $2 billion of R&D in\nFY 2007, with most of this (69%) supporting USDA intramural R&D. Although USDA focuses most of its R&D in the life sciences, it is also one of the largest funding agencies for research in the social sciences, predominantly agricultural economics.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 4-25\n\nFigure 4-6 Projected federal obligations for R&D, by agency and character of work: FY 2007\n\nOther than DOD Development 14%\n\nDHS 1%\n\nOther 4%\n\nUSDA 2%\n\nNSF 4%\n\nDOE 7%\n\nApplied research 39%\n\nNASA 7%\n\nDOD 50%\n\nDOD\nMajor systems development 78%\n\nBasic research 48%\n\nHHS 26%\n\nAdvanced technology development 10%\nApplied research 9%\nBasic research 2%\n\nDOD = Department of Defense; DOE = Department of Energy; DHS = Department of Homeland Security; HHS = Department of Health and Human Services; NASA = National Aeronautics and Space Administration; NSF = National Science Foundation; USDA = U.S. Department of Agriculture\nNOTE: Detail may not add to total because of rounding.\nSOURCE: NSF, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Federal Funds for Research and Development: Fiscal Years 2005, 2006, and 2007 (forthcoming).

DHS conducts and funds research in various areas but focuses significant resources on countering threats of catastrophic terrorism such as weapons of mass destruction. Most of this R&D is either conducted in DHS laboratories or under contract by industrial firms and FFRDCs. DHS also has established a grant-giving agency, Homeland Security Advanced Research Project Agency, modeled in part on the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency.\nOther Agencies Of the remaining R&D-funding federal agencies, 10 are\nexpected to fund between $100 million and $1 billion of R&D in FY 2007. The largest of these agencies in terms of R&D funding are the Department of Commerce (DOC), the Department of the Interior (DOI), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Unlike most of the larger R&Dfunding agencies, DOC, DOI, and EPA direct most of their R&D funds to their own laboratories, which are run by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the U.S. Geological Survey, and the EPA Office of Research and Development, respectively.\n\nFederally Funded R&D by Performer\nFederal Funding to Academia The federal government has historically been the pri-\nmary source of R&D funding to universities and colleges, accounting for as much as two-thirds of all academic R&D funding in the early 1980s. (For more detailed information on academic R&D, see chapter 5.) In FY 1955, obligations for academic R&D accounted for 7% of all federal R&D funding, or $0.8 billion in constant 2000 dollars. In FY 2007, R&D funding to academia represents an estimated 22% of all federal R&D obligations, or $21 billion in constant 2000 dollars. As figure 4-7 illustrates, funding to academia grew rapidly after FY 1998, the result of a successful bipartisan effort to double the budget of NIH from its FY 1998 level over 5 years. After FY 2004 however, federal R&D obligations to universities and colleges failed to keep pace with inflation.\nFederal Funding to Industry Since FY 1956, the federal government has obligated the\nlargest share of its R&D funding to industry. Federal funding for this sector, largely for development projects, has experienced more variability over the past 50 years than for any other sector (figure 4-7). R&D obligations to industry grew rapidly in the 1960s and peaked at $42 billion in constant 2000 dollars as the government invested heavily in its space program.

Similarly, military investments following the events of September 11, 2001, resulted in an influx of federal R&D funding to industry. After adjusting for inflation, federal R&D obligations to industry increased by more than 48% between FY 2001 and 2005. Beginning in FY 1989, the amount of federally funded R&D reported by industry began to diverge from the amount reported by the federal government. For details on this discrepancy, see sidebar, \"Tracking R&D: Gap Between Performer- and Source-Reported Expenditures.\"\nFederal Intramural R&D In FY 2007, obligations for federal intramural R&D to-\ntaled almost $25 billion. These funds supported R&D performed at federal laboratories as well as costs associated with the planning and administration of both intramural and extramural R&D projects. Among individual agencies, DOD continued to fund the most intramural R&D and is expected to account for almost half of all federal obligations for intramural R&D in FY 2007 (table 4-8). DOD's intramural R&D obligations are more than twice that of the second largest\n\nR&D-performing agency, HHS, which performs most of its intramural R&D at NIH in Maryland. Only two other agencies report intramural R&D obligations of more than $1 billion in FY 2007, NASA and USDA.\nFederally Funded Research and Development Centers\nFFRDCs are unique organizations that help the U.S. government meet \"special long-term research or development needs that cannot be met as effectively by existing in-house or contractor resources.\" According to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (35.017), an FFRDC is required \"to operate in the public interest with objectivity and independence, to be free from organizational conflicts of interest, and to have full disclosure of its affairs to the sponsoring agency.\" First established during World War II to assist DOD and DOE with R&D on nuclear weapons, FFRDCs today perform R&D with both defense and civilian applications across a broad range of S&E fields.\nOf the 37 FFRDCs active in 2005, DOE sponsors 16, more than any other agency. These 16 organizations performed almost $10 billion of R&D in FY 2005, three-quarters of that performed by all FFRDCs combined (appendix table 4-25).\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 4-27\n\nFour reported R&D expenditures of more than $1 billion in FY 2005: Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratory, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Together, these four laboratories account for more than half of all FFRDC R&D expenditures. Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory are the only two laboratories in the United States where research on the nation's nuclear stockpile is conducted. See sidebar, \"Federal R&D Infrastructure,\" for more information on FFRDCs' and other federal facilities' contributions to the U.S. R&D system.\nFederal Research Funding by Field\nFederal agencies fund research in a wide range of S&E fields, from aeronautical engineering to sociology. The relative amount of (basic plus applied) research funding differs by field, as do trends in funding over time. According to preliminary estimates, federal obligations for research (excluding development) will total $55 billion in FY 2007 (see \"Definitions of R&D\" sidebar earlier in this chapter). Half of this funding, almost $28 billion, supports research in the life sciences.

The balance of federal research obligations ($5 billion) supports the social sciences, psychology, and all other sciences.\nHHS, primarily through NIH, provides the largest share (52%) of all federal research obligations in FY 2007, with most of its obligations funding medical and other related life sciences. The next four largest federal agencies in terms of research funding in FY 2007 are DOD (12%), DOE (11%), NASA (7%), and NSF (7%). DOD's research funding is focused on engineering ($3.6 billion) and on mathematics and computer sciences ($1.0 billion). DOE provides substantial funding for research in the physical sciences ($2.4 billion) and engineering ($2.0 billion). NASA's research funding also emphasizes engineering ($1.5 billion), followed by physical sciences ($1.1 billion) and environmental sciences ($1.0 billion). NSF, whose mission is to \"promote the progress of science,\" has a relatively balanced research portfolio, contributing between $0.5 and $0.9 billion to researchers in each of the following fields: mathematics and computer sciences, physical sciences, engineering environmental sciences, and life sciences.\nFederal obligations for research have grown at different rates for different S&E fields, reflecting changes in perceived public needs in those fields, changes in the national resources (e.g., scientists, equipment, and facilities) that have been built up in those fields over time, and differences in scientific opportunities across fields. Over the period 1986\u00ad 2007, total federal research obligations grew on average 3.4% per year in real terms, from $23 billion in 2000 dollars to $47 billion in 2000 dollars. The fields that experienced higherthan-average growth during this period were mathematics and computer sciences (5.6% per year in real terms), life sciences (4.6%), and psychology (6.1%) (appendix table 4-32). Funding for the remaining fields also grew at a faster rate than inflation over this period: social sciences (2.7%), engineering (2.0%), environmental sciences (1.9%), and physical sciences (0.5%).\nCaution should be used when examining trends in federal support for more detailed S&E fields than those presented above because federal agencies classify a significant amount of R&D only by major S&E field, such as life sciences, physical sciences, or social sciences. In FY 2005, for example, 1% of the federal research obligations classified by major S&E field were not subdivided into detailed fields. This was less pronounced in physical sciences and mathematics and computer sciences, in which all but 6% of the research dollars were subdivided. It was most pronounced in social sciences and psychology, in which, respectively, 69% and 97% of federal research obligations were not subdivided into detailed fields (appendix table 4-32).\n\n\f4-28 \n\nChapter 4.

See appendix table 4-31.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nFederal R&D Budget by National Objective\nBefore any agency can obligate funds for R&D, it must first have budget authority from Congress for such activity. In the president's FY 2008 budget submission to Congress, the proposed total federal budget authority for R&D is $138 billion. Adjusting for inflation, this amount is a 1% decline from the previous year's budget. This decline follows a 5-year period of increasing inflation-adjusted federal R&D budgets. Although R&D tends to be a popular budgetary item, the growing federal debt may hamper future growth in federal R&D.\nTo assist Congress and the president in evaluating and adjusting the federal budget, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requests agencies to allocate their budget requests into specific categories called budget functions.\n\nThese budget functions represent a wide range of national objectives the government aims to advance, from national defense to health to transportation (see sidebar, \"Federal R&D Initiatives\").\nDefense-Related R&D The largest R&D budget function in the FY 2008 budget\nis defense, with a proposed budget authority of $82 billion, or 60% of the entire federal R&D budget. (DOD requested $78 billion for its research, development, testing, and evaluation budget; the remainder of defense-related R&D is funded by DOE and HHS.) In 1980, the federal budget authority for defense-related R&D was roughly equal to that for nondefense R&D, but by 1985, defense R&D had grown to more than double nondefense R&D (figure 4-11). The gap between the\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 4-29\n\nTracking R&D: Gap Between Performer- and Source-Reported Expenditures\n\nIn some OECD countries, including the United States, total government R&D support figures reported by government agencies differ from those reported by performers of R&D work. Consistent with international guidance and standards, most countries' national R&D expenditure totals and time series are based primarily on data reported by performers (OECD 2002). Although funding and performing series may be expected to differ for many reasons, such as different bases used for reporting government obligations (fiscal year) and performance expenditures (calendar year), the gap between the two U.S. R&D series has widened during the past decade or more.\nDuring the mid-1980s, performer-reported federal R&D in the United States exceeded federal reports of funding by $3\u00ad$4 billion annually (5%\u00ad10% of the government total). This pattern reversed itself toward the end of the decade; in 1989, the government-reported R&D total exceeded performer reports by $1 billion. For FY 2005, federal agencies reported obligating $109 billion in total R&D to all R&D performers ($44 billion to the business sector), compared with $94 billion in federal funding reported by the performers of R&D ($23 billion by businesses). Hence, overall industrywide estimates equal approximately a 50% paper \"loss\" of federally reported 2005 R&D support (figure 4-9). The difference in federal R&D totals was primarily in DOD development funding of industry.\nSeveral investigations into the possible causes for the data gap produced insights into the issue, but a conclusive explanation has been elusive. According to a General Accounting Office (GAO 2001) investigation, \"Because the gap is the result of comparing two dissimilar types of financial data [federal obligations and performer expenditures], it does not necessarily reflect poor quality data, nor does it reflect whether performers are receiving or spending all the federal R&D funds obligated to them. Thus, even if the data collection and reporting issues were addressed, a gap would still exist.\" Echoing this assessment, the National Research Council (2005a) notes that comparing federal outlays for R&D (as opposed to obligations) to performer expenditures results in a smaller discrepancy. In FY 2005, federal agencies reported total R&D outlays of $103 billion.\n\nFigure 4-9 Difference in U.S. performer- and agency-reported federal R&D: 1980\u00ad2006\nPercent\n20\n\n0\n\n\u00ad20\n\n\u00ad40\n\n\u00ad60 1980 1983 1986\n\n1990 1994 1998 All performers\n\n2002\n\n2006\n\n20\n\n0\n\n\u00ad20\n\n\u00ad40\n\n\u00ad60 1980 1983 1986 1990 1994 1998\nIndustrial performers\n\n2002\n\n2006\n\nNOTE: Difference defined as percentage of federally reported R&D, with positive difference indicating that performer-reported R&D exceeds agency-reported R&D.\nSOURCES: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics (NSF/SRS), National Patterns of R&D Resources (annual series); and NSF/SRS, Federal Funds for Research and Development: Fiscal Years 2005, 2006, and 2007 (forthcoming). See appendix table 4-29.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\f4-30 \n\nChapter 4. Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nFederal R&D Infrastructure\n\nThe U.S. government invests substantial resources not only in R&D, but also in the facilities and instrumentation required by researchers to tackle problems at the frontier of S&T. In FY 2007, federal agencies are expected to obligate more than $3.5 billion for R&D plant, capital equipment, and facilities for use in R&D. Two agencies, NASA and DOE, account for more than two-thirds of all federal R&D plant obligations in FY 2007. Some examples of research infrastructure made possible through federal funding include:\n Supercomputing resources. As of November 2006, 6 of the top 10 supercomputers in the world were located in U.S. FFRDCs or government laboratories (TOP500 Supercomputer Sites 2007). The Terascale Simulation Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory houses two of the world's fastest supercomputers: BlueGene/L, ranked fastest in the world, and ASC Purple, ranked number four. These powerful computers support DOE's research on the safety and reliability of the nation's nuclear arsenal. The federal supercomputing resources are also used for nondefense purposes such as research on climate change and bioinformatics. For example, the DOE Joint Genome Institute leveraged the computing resources and research capabilities of multiple federal laboratories to contribute to the sequencing of the human genome. For more information, see DOE (2007).\n Hubble Space Telescope. Launched in 1990 and upgraded during four subsequent servicing missions, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope revolutionized astronomy by providing deep, clear views of the universe without the distorting effects of the Earth's atmosphere. Among its many highlights, Hubble was the first optical telescope to provide convincing proof of a black hole. More than 6,300 published scientific papers have been based on its data. At the time of its launch, the Hubble Space Telescope cost $1.5 billion. More details are available at NASA (2007).\n Antarctic research stations. NSF funds and manages the U.S. Antarctic Program, which coordinates almost all U.S. science on the continent, including research carried out by other federal agencies. The unique Antarctic environment has proven to be a boon to many fields of study. For example, astronomers and astrophysicists have benefited from the excellent optical properties of the atmosphere at the South Pole (resulting from its high elevation, low temperature, and low\n\nhumidity) and from the extremely clear, thick, and homogeneous ice that makes neutrino detection possible. For additional information, see NSF/OPP (2007).\n Highly Infectious Diseases Laboratories. DOD and HHS (through both NIH and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) currently operate several laboratories that facilitate research on pathogens that require the highest levels of safety precaution, such as Ebola, viral hemorrhagic fevers, monkeypox, and avian influenza. DHS also plans to operate two such labs.\nMany of the laboratories funded by the federal government provide scientists and engineers with tools and facilities that otherwise would not exist. For example, capabilities in DOE user facilities include particle and nuclear physics accelerators, synchrotron light sources, neutron scattering facilities, genome sequencing, supercomputers, and high-speed computer networks. By itself, DOE's Office of Science oversees facilities used by more than 20,000 non-DOE researchers each year in a range of scientific disciplines (figure 4-10). User facilities are one channel for collaborating and diffusing knowledge and technologies (see \"Technology Transfer Metrics\" later in this chapter).\n\nFigure 4-10 External users at Department of Energy facilities, by science program: FY 2006\n\nFusion energy sciences 475 (2%) Nuclear physics 1,990 (9%)\nBiological and environmental\nresearch 2,480 (12%)\nHigh-energy physics 3,026\n(14%)\n\nBasic energy sciences 10,024 (47%)\n\nAdvanced scientific computing 3,203 (15%)\nNOTES: External users are non-Department of Energy (DOE) researchers.

To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of federal R&D investments in these areas, the administration continues to encourage strategic coordination among stakeholder agencies. Priorities detailed in the Administration's FY 2008 budget include:\n American Competitive Initiative (ACI). The ACI invests in basic research areas that advance knowledge and technologies used by scientists in nearly every field through DOC's National Institute of Standards and Technology, DOE's Office of Science, and NSF. For FY 2008, the second year of ACI, President Bush proposes $11.4 billion for these three agencies. For an overview of the initiative, see OSTP (2006).\n Climate Change. The Climate Change Science Program (CCSP) is focused on improving decisionmaking on climate change science issues. This program has an FY 2008 R&D budget of $1.5 billion, of which the National Aeronautics and Space Administration accounts for 56%. More information is available at CCSP (2007) and Climate Change Technology Program (2007).\n Combating Terrorism. This area supports the president's strategy for homeland security by harnessing federal R&D programs that could help to deter, prevent, or mitigate terrorist acts. The FY 2008 budget provides support for capabilities in several areas including detection and imaging, cargo screening, biometric systems,\n\nand critical medical countermeasures. For an overview of homeland-security related R&D, see Knezo (2006).\n Hydrogen Fuel. The Hydrogen Fuel Initiative seeks to support R&D aimed at developing and improving technologies for producing, distributing, and using hydrogen to power automobiles. DOE will continue to lead this initiative. The 2008 budget completes the president's 5-year, $1.2 billion commitment announced in his 2003 State of the Union address, but work will continue on the many technical challenges that remain. For more details, see Interagency Working Group on Hydrogen and Fuel Cells (2007).\n Nanotechnology. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) supports basic and applied research on materials, devices, and systems that exploit the fundamentally distinct properties of matter at the atomic and molecular levels. The FY 2008 budget provides $1.4 billion for NNI R&D, three-fourths of which is allocated to NSF, DOD, and DOE. For more information, see NNI (2007).\n Networking and Information Technology. The multiagency Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) program aims to leverage agency research efforts in advanced networking and information technologies. The FY 2008 budget provides $3.1 billion for NITRD R&D, including about $1 billion each to DOD and NSF. Additional information is available at NITRD (2007).\n\ndefense and nondefense R&D budgets shrank almost every year after 1986 until 2001, when the defense budget function represented 53% of the federal R&D budget. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, reversed this trend, and the annual federal defense R&D budget grew by an estimated $36 billion over the next 7 years.\nCivilian-Related R&D R&D accounts for 13.1% ($56 billion) of the FY 2008\nfederal nondefense discretionary budget authority of $428 billion, or slightly more than the R&D share reserved for defense activities (12.7% of the $647 billion discretionary defense budget authority in FY 2008). Almost 95% of federal basic research funding is for nondefense budget functions, accounting for a large part of the budgets of agencies with nondefense missions such as general science (NSF), health (NIH), and space research and technology (NASA) (table 4-9; appendix table 4-27). Over the last several years, however, the budget authority for basic research has been rather flat. In FY 2002 that budget authority was approximately $23 billion (in constant 2000 dollars), and the same amount has been proposed for FY 2008.\n\nThe most dramatic change in national R&D priorities during the past 25 years has been the large rise in health-related R&D. As illustrated in figure 4-11, health-related R&D rose from representing 25% of the federal nondefense R&D budget allocation in FY 1980 to a high of 55% in FY 2005. Most of this growth occurred after 1998, when NIH's budget was set on a pace to double by 2003 (NSF/SRS 2002a). Growth in health-related R&D has since slowed considerably and accounted for 52% of the proposed FY 2008 nondefense R&D budget.\nThe budget allocation for space-related R&D peaked in the 1960s, during the height of the nation's efforts to surpass the Soviet Union in space exploration. Since the loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia and its crew of seven on 1 February 2003, manned space missions were curtailed. Nonetheless, the proportion of the proposed federal nondefense R&D budget for space research was higher in FY 2008 (17%) than in FY 2003 (15%). In the president's FY 2008 budget, 58% of NASA's $17 billion discretionary budget was allocated for R&D. This space R&D total is higher (in constant dollars) than at any time since FY 1999.\nCompared with that of health-related R&D, the budget allocation for general science R&D has grown relatively little\n\n\f4-32 \n\nChapter 4.

See appendix table 4-26.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nduring the past 25 years. The growth that has occurred in general science R&D is more the result of a reclassification of several DOE programs from energy to general science in FY 1998 than it is the result of increased budget allocations (figure 4-11).\nFederal and State R&D Tax Credits\nBackground Governments have used multiple policy tools to foster\nR&D in diverse industries, technologies, and innovation environments (Martin and Scott 2000; Tassey 1996). Fiscal policy tools include direct funding (as discussed earlier in\n\nthis chapter) and indirect incentives such as tax relief.19 Tax relief may take the form of a tax allowance, exemption or deduction (a reduction in taxable income), or a tax credit (a reduction in tax liability). The United States offers both types of incentives, namely a deduction for qualified R&D under U.S. Internal Revenue Code (C.F.R. Title 26) Section 174 and a tax credit under Section 41 (Guenther 2006; Hall 2001). R&D tax incentives in advanced economies vary in terms of how they are structured or targeted, their effect on public budgets, and their effectiveness in stimulating innovation (Bloom, Griffith, and Van Reenen 2002; OECD 2003). This section focuses on business R&D tax credits at the federal and state levels.\nThe federal research and experimentation (R&E) tax credit was established by the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981. Given its temporary status, it is subject to periodic extensions, and it was last renewed by the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (Public Law 109\u00ad432) through 31 December 2007.20 The Bush administration has proposed making the R&E tax credit permanent (OMB 2007).\nUnder the federal R&E tax credit, companies can take a 20% credit for qualified research above a base amount for activities undertaken in the United States.21 For most companies, the base amount is determined by multiplying R&Dto-sales ratio by the average gross receipts for the previous 4 years. Currently, the reference period for R&D-to-sales ratio is fixed as the average from 1984 to 1988 (start-up companies follow different provisions). Thus, the credit is characterized as a fixed-base incremental credit (Hall 2001; Wilson 2007). Companies, however, benefit by less than the statutory credit rate of 20%, since benefits from the credit are taxable.22\nAn alternative R&E tax credit has been available since 1996 (Small Business Protection Act, Public Law 104\u00ad188). The 2006 Act (Public Law 109\u00ad432), signed into law in December 2006, not only extended the research credit for 2 years--2006 (retroactively) and 2007--but also increased the rates for the alternative credit for 2007. In addition, it created a new, simplified alternative credit beginning in 2007. Companies may select only one of these credit configurations on a permanent basis, unless the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) authorizes a change. A 20% credit with a separate threshold is provided for payments to universities for basic research.\nFederal Corporate Tax Credit Claims R&E tax credit claims reached an estimated $5.5 billion\nin 2003 ($5.2 billion in constant, or inflation-adjusted, dollars), involving just under 10,400 corporate tax returns, compared with the all-time high of $7.1 billion in 2000 (table 4-10), according to IRS Statistics of Income Division (SOI) estimates.23 Even at their 2000 peak, R&E tax credit claims accounted for less than 4% of industry-funded R&D expenditures (figure 4-12). Since 1998, corporate tax returns classified in five North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) industries accounted for approximately 80% of\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 4-33\n\nTable 4-9 Budget authority for R&D, by federal agency and character of work (proposed levels): FY 2008\n(Millions of current dollars)\n\nAgency\n\nAll discretionary budget authority All R&D\n\nBasic research\n\nApplied research\n\nDevelopment\n\nR&D share of discretionary budget (%)\n\nAll federal government ........ 1,074,966\n\n137,912\n\n28,371\n\n26,638\n\n82,903\n\n12.8\n\nDOD .................................\n\n627,718\n\n78,658\n\n1,428\n\n4,357\n\n72,873\n\n12.5\n\nHHS .................................\n\n69,330\n\n28,874\n\n15,615\n\n13,237\n\n22\n\n41.6\n\nNASA ...............................\n\n17,310\n\n10,060\n\n2,226\n\n1,127\n\n6,707\n\n58.1\n\nDOE .................................\n\n24,310\n\n8,169\n\n3,409\n\n2,869\n\n1,891\n\n33.6\n\nNSF ..................................\n\n6,430\n\n4,373\n\n3,993\n\n380\n\n0\n\n68.0\n\nUSDA ...............................\n\n20,226\n\n1,911\n\n771\n\n984\n\n156\n\n9.4\n\nDHS .................................\n\n34,511\n\n934\n\n132\n\n533\n\n269\n\n2.7\n\nDOC .................................\n\n6,554\n\n932\n\n164\n\n696\n\n72\n\n14.2\n\nVA .....................................\n\n39,418\n\n822\n\n330\n\n444\n\n48\n\n2.1\n\nDOT ..................................\n\n12,110\n\n793\n\n0\n\n541\n\n252\n\n6.5\n\nDOI ...................................\n\n10,610\n\n619\n\n39\n\n525\n\n55\n\n5.8\n\nEPA ..................................\n\n7,200\n\n562\n\n94\n\n364\n\n104\n\n7.8\n\nOther ................................\n\n199,239\n\n1,205\n\n170\n\n581\n\n454\n\n0.6\n\nDHS = Department of Homeland Security; DOC = Department of Commerce; DOD = Department of Defense; DOE = Department of Energy; DOI = Department of the Interior; DOT = Department of Transportation; EPA = Environmental Protection Agency; HHS = Department of Health and Human Services; NASA = National Aeronautics and Space Administration; NSF = National Science Foundation; USDA = U.S. Department of Agriculture; VA = Department of Veterans Affairs\n\nSOURCE: Office of Management and Budget, Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 2008 (2007).\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nTable 4-10\nFederal research and experimentation tax credit claims and corporate tax returns claiming credit: 1990\u00ad2003\n\nTax credit claims ($millions)\n\nYear\n\nCurrent\n\nConstant Tax returns\n\n1990.................. 1991.................. 1992.................. 1993.................. 1994.................. 1995.................. 1996.................. 1997.................. 1998.................. 1999.................. 2000.................. 2001.................. 2002.................. 2003..................\n\n1,547 1,585 1,515 1,857 2,423 1,422 2,134 4,398 5,208 5,281 7,079 6,356 5,656 5,488\n\n1,896 1,877 1,754 2,101 2,684 1,544 2,274 4,609 5,399 5,396 7,079 6,207 5,428 5,158\n\n8,699 9,001 7,750 9,933 9,150 7,877 9,709 10,668 9,849 10,019 10,495 10,389 10,254 10,369\n\nNOTES: Data exclude Internal Revenue Service (IRS) forms 1120S (S corporations), 1120-REIT (Real Estate Investment Trusts), and 1120-RIC (Regulated Investment Companies).

In 2003, the top five industries accounted for a total of $4.2 billion or 77% of credit claims:\n Computer and electronic products (21%)\n Chemicals, including pharmaceuticals and medicines (18%)\n Transportation equipment, including motor vehicles and aerospace (16%)\n Information, including software (12%)\n Professional, scientific, and technical services, including computer services and R&D services (10%)\nIn 2003, companies classified in the professional, scientific, and technical services industry represented one-third of all corporate returns claiming the R&E tax credit, followed by computer and electronic products and information, each with about\n\n15%. Consequently, among the top five industries listed above, professional, scientific, and technical services had the lowest average claims per return ($15.9 million) in 2003, compared with an average of $52.9 million per return overall.24\nState Tax Credits At least 32 states offered credits for company-funded\nR&D (table 4-11) in 2006, according to Wilson (2007). The first such credit was enacted by Minnesota in 1982 only a year after the federal R&E credit was enacted. Since then, the number of states offering a research credit has increased gradually (figure 4-13).\nMore than half of these states' research credits (19 of 32) mimic the structure of the federal credit, namely, an incremental credit with a fixed base (table 4-11). Another 10 states offer an incremental credit with a moving average\n\nTable 4-11 Summary of state-level R&D tax credits: 2006\n\nState\nArizona ......................................................

Three states (Connecticut, Hawaii, and West Virginia) have a nonincremental credit, that is, the credit applies to all qualified research. These counts do not include narrowly targeted credits (either by technology or geographically within the state) or credits with a cap.25\nIn a study attempting to measure the impact of states' research credits, Wilson (2007) was able to estimate increases in within-state R&D. At the same time, however, estimated effects appear to come from shifts in other states' R&D, raising questions about the aggregate effect of these state R&D incentives. Further empirical research on these issues is warranted given the recent enactment of some of these credits.\nInternational R&D Comparisons\nData on R&D expenditures are often used to make international comparisons, in part because of the relative ease of comparing monetary data across countries. But although it is possible to compare the cost of R&D in two countries, differences in their national systems of innovation may make one country more effective than the other in translating investments in S&T into economic growth or other social benefits. Although it can be difficult to assess the qualitative differences in the R&D and innovation systems in different countries, it is important to keep these differences in mind when analyzing data presented in this section on international R&D spending patterns.\nMost of the R&D data presented in this section are from the OECD, the most reliable source for such international comparisons. However, an increasing number of non-OECD countries and organizations now collect and publish R&D\n\nstatistics (with variable levels of international comparability), which are cited at various points in this section. No R&D-specific currency exchange rates exist, but for comparison purposes, international R&D data have been converted to U.S. dollars with purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates (see sidebar, \"Comparing International R&D Expenditures\").\nGlobal R&D Expenditures\nWorldwide R&D performance is concentrated in a few developed nations. In 2002, global R&D expenditures totaled at least $813 billion; one-third of this world total was accounted for by the United States, the largest country in terms of domestic R&D expenditures, and 45% of this total was accounted for by the two largest countries in terms of R&D performance, the United States and Japan.\nAs figure 4-14 illustrates, more than 95% of global R&D is performed in North America, Asia, and Europe. Within each of these regions, a small number of countries dominate in terms of expenditures on R&D: the United States in North America; Japan and China in Asia; and Germany, France, and the United Kingdom in Europe.26\nWealthy, well-developed nations, generally represented by OECD countries, perform most of the world's R&D, but R&D expenditures have grown rapidly in several lesserdeveloped nations. In 2004, Brazil performed an estimated $14 billion of R&D (RICYT 2007), although the compilations of its R&D statistics do not yet fully conform to OECD guidelines. India performed an estimated $21 billion in 2000, making it the seventh largest country in terms of R&D in that year, ahead of South Korea (UNESCO/Institute for Statistics 2007). China had the fourth largest expenditures on R&D in 2000 ($45 billion), behind Germany's $52 billion (OECD 2006b). In 2005, it is estimated that $115 billion of R&D was performed in China, making it the third largest country in terms of R&D expenditures. Given the lack of R&D-specific exchange rates (see sidebar, \"Comparing International R&D Expenditures\"), it is difficult to draw conclusions from these absolute R&D figures, but China's nearly decade-long ramp-up of R&D expenditures appears unprecedented in recent years.\nOECD and G-7 R&D Expenditures\nThe 30 OECD countries represented 81% of global R&D, or $657 billion, in 2002. Although global R&D estimates are not available for later years, the R&D performance of OECD countries grew to $726 billion in 2004. The G-7 countries performed two-thirds of the world's R&D in 2002 and 83% of OECD's R&D in 2004. Outside of the G-7 countries, South Korea is the only country that accounted for a substantial share of the OECD total (4% in 2004).\nMore money was spent on R&D activities in the United States in 2004 than in the rest of the G-7 countries combined (figure 4-15). In terms of relative shares, the U.S. share of the G-7's R&D expenditures has fluctuated between 48%\n\n\f4-36 \n\nChapter 4.

After the early 1990s, the U.S. percentage of total G-7 R&D expenditures grew as a result of a worldwide slowing in R&D performance that was more pronounced in other countries. R&D spending rebounded in the late 1990s in several G-7 countries, but the recovery was most robust in the United States, and the U.S. share of total G-7 R&D has exceeded 50% since 1997, peaking at 52% in 2000, before dropping slightly to 51% of total in 2004.\nIndicators of R&D Intensity\nInternational comparisons of absolute R&D expenditures are complicated by the fact that countries vary widely in terms of the size of their population and economy. For example, although Germany and China had similar R&D expenditures in 2000, China's population was more than 15 times larger, and its economy more than twice as large, as Germany's in that year. Policy analysts commonly use various measures of R&D intensity to account for these size differences when making international comparisons.\nOne of the first (Steelman 1947) and now one of the more widely used indicators of a country's R&D intensity is the ratio of R&D spending to GDP, the main measure of a na-\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 4-37\n\nComparing International R&D Expenditures\n\nComparisons of international R&D statistics are hampered by the lack of R&D-specific exchange rates. If countries do not share a common currency, some conversion must be made to compare their R&D expenditures. Two approaches are commonly used to facilitate international R&D comparisons: (1) normalize national R&D expenditures by dividing by GDP, which circumvents the problem of currency conversion; and (2) convert all foreign-denominated expenditures to a single currency, which results in indicators of absolute effort. The first method is a straightforward calculation that permits only gross national comparisons of R&D intensity. The second method permits absolute-level comparisons and analyses of countries' sector- and field-specific R&D, but it entails choosing an appropriate method of currency conversion.\nBecause no widely accepted R&D-specific exchange rates exist, the choice is between market exchange rates (MERs) and purchasing power parities (PPPs). These rates are the only series consistently compiled and available for a large number of countries over an extended period of time.\nMERs. At their best, MERs represent the relative value of currencies for goods and services that are traded across borders; that is, MERs measure a currency's relative international buying power. However, MERs may not accurately reflect the true cost of goods or services that are not traded internationally. In addition, fluctuations in MERs as a result of currency speculation, political events such as wars or boycotts, and official currency intervention, which have little or nothing to do with changes in the relative prices of internationally traded goods, greatly reduce their statistical utility.\nPPPs. PPPs were developed because of the shortcomings of MERs described above (Ward 1985). PPPs take into account the cost differences across countries of buying a similar \"market basket\" of goods and services in numerous expenditure categories, including nontradables. The PPP basket is therefore assumed to be representative of total GDP across countries.\nAlthough the goods and services included in the market basket used to calculate PPP rates differ from the major components of R&D costs (fixed assets as well as wages of scientists, engineers, and support personnel), they still result in a more suitable domestic price converter than one based on foreign trade flows. Exchange rate movements bear little relationship to changes in the cost of domestically performed R&D. The adoption of the euro as the common currency for many European countries provides a useful example: although Germany and Portugal now\n\nshare a common currency, the real costs of most goods and services are substantially less in Portugal. PPPs are therefore the preferred international standard for calculating cross-country R&D comparisons wherever possible and are used in all official R&D tabulations of OECD.*\nBecause MERs tend to understate the domestic purchasing power of developing countries' currencies, PPPs can produce substantially larger R&D estimates than MERs do for these countries. For example, China's 2005 R&D expenditures are $30 billion using MERs but are $115 billion using PPPs. Appendix table 4-2 shows the relative difference between MERs and PPPs for a number of countries.\nAlthough PPPs are available for developing countries such as India and China, there are several reasons why they may be less useful for converting R&D expenditures than in more developed countries:\n It is difficult or impossible to assess the quality of PPPs for some countries, most notably China. Although PPP estimates for OECD countries are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing countries are often rough approximations. The latter estimates are based on extrapolations of numbers published by the United Nations International Comparison Program and by Professors Robert Summers and Alan Heston of the University of Pennsylvania and their colleagues.\n The composition of the market basket used to calculate PPPs likely differs substantially between developing and developed countries. The structural differences in the economies of developing and developed countries, as well as disparities in income, may result in a market basket of goods and services in a developing country that is quite different from the market basket of a developed country, particularly as far as these baskets relate to the various costs of R&D.\n R&D performance in developing countries often is concentrated geographically in the most advanced cities and regions in terms of infrastructure and level of educated workforce. The costs of goods and services in these areas can be substantially greater than for the country as a whole.\n*Recent research calls into question the use of GDP PPPs for deflating R&D expenditures. Analyzing manufacturing R&D inputs and outputs in six industrialized OECD countries, Dougherty et al. (2007) conclude that \"the use of an R&D PPP will yield comparative costs and R&D intensities that vary substantially from the current practice of using GDP PPPs, likely increasing the real R&D performance of the comparison countries relative to the United States.\"\n\n\f4-38 \n\nChapter 4. Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\ntion's total economic activity. Policymakers often use this ratio for international benchmarking and goal setting.\nNormalized indicators, such as R&D/GDP ratios, are useful for international comparisons because they not only account for size differences between countries, but they also obviate the need for exchange rates. However, even normalized indicators are not always comparable from one country to another. This occurs most often when the variable being used to normalize the indicator differs across countries. For example, the structure of national economies, and hence GDP, varies greatly. As figure 4-16 shows, the agricultural and industrial sectors account for less than one-third of GDP in the United States and the other G-7 countries. These sectors represent similarly small shares of the labor force in the G-7 countries. This contrasts with less-developed nations such as China, where the agricultural and industrial sectors account for more than half of GDP and an even larger share of the labor force (estimated to be 69%) (CIA 2007). In recent years, the service sector has grown substantially in India in terms of its contribution to GDP (61% in 2005), but more than half of India's labor force works in the agricultural sector. Differences such as these in the structure of economies can result in significant country-to-country differences in terms of various R&D indicators.\n\nTotal R&D/GDP Ratios The ratio of R&D expenditures to GDP can indicate the\nintensity of R&D activity in relation to other economic activity and can be used to gauge a nation's commitment to R&D at different points in time. For example, since 1953, R&D expenditures as a percentage of GDP in the United States have ranged from a minimum of 1.4% (in 1953) to a maximum of 2.9% (in 1964). Most of the growth over time in the R&D/GDP ratio can be attributed to increases in nonfederal R&D spending, the majority of which is company financed. Nonfederally financed R&D increased from 0.6% of GDP in 1953 to a projected 1.9% of GDP in 2006 (down from a high of 2.0% of GDP in 2000). The increase in nonfederally financed R&D as a percentage of GDP illustrated in figure 4-17 is indicative of the growing role of S&T in the U.S. economy.\nHistorically, most of the peaks and valleys in the U.S. R&D/GDP ratio can be attributed to changing priorities in federal R&D spending. The initial drop in the R&D/GDP ratio from its peak in 1964 largely reflects federal cutbacks in defense and space R&D programs. Gains in energy R&D activities between 1975 and 1979 resulted in a relative stabilization of the ratio. Beginning in the late 1980s, cuts in defense-related R&D kept federal R&D spending from keeping pace with GDP growth, while growth in nonfederal sources of R&D spending generally kept pace with or exceeded GDP growth. Since 2000, defense-related R&D\n\nFigure 4-16 Composition of gross domestic product for selected countries, by sector: 2005 or 2006\nAgriculture Industry Services\n\nChina (2006)\n\n12\n\nSouth Korea (2006)\n\n3\n\nRussia (2006) 5\n\nIndia (2005)\n\n20\n\nCanada (2006) 2\n\n29\n\nItaly (2006) 2\n\n29\n\nGermany (2006) 1\n\n29\n\nJapan (2006) 2\n\n25\n\nUK (2006) 1\n\n26\n\nFrance (2006) 2\n\n21\n\nU.S. (2006) 1\n\n20\n\n48 41 37\n19\n\n40 56 58 61 69 69 70 73 73 77 79\n\n0\n\n20\n\nUK = United Kingdom\n\n40\n\n60\n\nPercent\n\n80\n\n100\n\nSOURCE: Central Intelligence Agency, The World Factbook 2007, http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/index.html, accessed 2 March 2007.\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 4-39\n\nspending has surged, and federal R&D spending growth has outpaced GDP growth. (See the discussion of defense-related R&D earlier in this chapter.)\nFor many of the G-8 countries (i.e., the G-7 countries plus Russia), the latest R&D/GDP ratio is no higher now than it was at the start of the 1990s, which ushered in a period of slow growth or decline in their overall R&D efforts (figure 4-18). The two exceptions, Japan and Canada, both exhibited substantial increases on this indicator between 1990 and 2004. In Japan this indicator declined in the early 1990s as a result of reduced or level R&D spending by industry and government, a pattern similar to that exhibited by the United States. Japan's R&D/GDP ratio subsequently rose to 3.2% in 2004, the result of both a resurgence of industrial R&D in the mid-1990s coupled with slow GDP growth. By contrast, over the same period, GDP grew more robustly in Canada; therefore the rise in its R&D/GDP ratio is more indicative of R&D growth.\nBecause of the business sector's dominant role in global R&D funding and performance, R&D/GDP ratios are most useful when comparing countries with national S&T systems of comparable maturity and development. Geopolitical events also affect R&D intensity indicators, as evidenced by Germany and Russia. [West] Germany's R&D/GDP ratio fell from 2.8% at the end of the 1980s, before reunification, to 2.2% in 1994 for all of Germany. Its R&D/GDP has since risen to 2.5% in 2005. The end of the Cold War and collapse of the Soviet Union had a drastic effect on Russia's R&D intensity. R&D performance in Russia was estimated at 2.0% of GDP in 1990; that figure dropped to 1.4% in 1991 and then dropped further to 0.7% in 1992. The severity of this decline is compounded by the fact that Russian GDP\nFigure 4-17 U.S. R&D share of gross domestic product: 1953\u00ad2006\nPercent 3.0\nTotal R&D/GDP\n2.5\n2.0 Nonfederal R&D/GDP\n1.5\n1.0 Federal R&D/GDP\n0.5\n0 1953 1961 1966 1971 1976 1981 1986 1991 1996 2001 2006\nGDP = gross domestic product SOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, National Patterns of R&D Resources (annual series).

Between 1998 and 2003, Russia's R&D doubled, and its R&D/GDP ratio rose from 1.0% to 1.3%. This growth was not maintained in the subsequent 2 years, and Russia's R&D/GDP ratio dropped to 1.1% in 2005.\nOverall, the United States ranked seventh among OECD countries in terms of reported R&D/GDP ratios (table 4-12), but several of its states have R&D intensities of more than 4%. Massachusetts, a state with an economy larger than Sweden's and approximately twice the size of Israel's, has reported an R&D intensity at or above 5% since 2001 (see the section entitled \"Location of R&D Performance\"). Israel (not an OECD country), devoting 4.7% of its GDP to R&D, currently leads all countries, followed by Sweden (3.9%), Finland (3.5%), Japan (3.2%), and South Korea (3.0%).

This pattern broadly reflects the wealth and level of economic development for these regions. A strong link exists between countries with high incomes that emphasize the production of high-technology goods and services and those that invest heavily in R&D activities (OECD 1999). The private sector in low-income countries often has a low concentration of high-technology industries, resulting in low overall R&D spending and therefore low R&D/GDP ratios.\nOutside the European region, R&D spending has intensified considerably since the early 1990s. Several Asian countries, most notably South Korea and China, have been particularly aggressive in expanding their support for R&D and S&T-based development. In Latin America and the Pacific region, other non-OECD countries also have attempted to increase R&D substantially during the past several years. Even with recent gains, however, most non-European (nonOECD) countries invest a smaller share of their economic output in R&D than do OECD members (with the exception of Israel). All Latin American countries for which such data are available report R&D/GDP ratios at or below 1% (RICYT 2007). This distribution is consistent with broader indicators of economic growth and wealth.\n\nNondefense R&D Expenditures and R&D/GDP Ratios\nAnother indicator of R&D intensity, the ratio of nondefense R&D to GDP, is useful when comparing nations with different financial investments in national defense. Although defense-related R&D does result in spillovers that produce commercial and social benefits, nondefense R&D is more directly oriented toward national scientific progress, economic competitiveness, and standard-of-living improvements. Using this indicator, the relative position of the United States falls below that of Germany and just above Canada among the G-7 nations (figure 4-18). This is because the United States devotes more of its R&D, primarily for development rather than research, to defense-related activities than do most other countries. In 2006, approximately 16% of U.S. R&D was defense related, whereas for historical reasons, less than 1% of the R&D performed in Germany and Japan is defense related. Approximately 10% of the United Kingdom's total R&D was defense related in 2004.\nBasic Research/GDP Ratios R&D involves a wide range of activities, ranging from\nbasic research to the development of marketable goods and services. Because it is motivated primarily by curiosity, basic research generally has low short-term returns, but it builds intellectual capital and lays the groundwork for future\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 4-41\n\nadvances in S&T. (See sidebar, \"Definitions of R&D.\") The relative investment in basic research as a share of GDP indicates differences in national priorities, traditions, and incentive structures with respect to S&T. Estimates of basic research often involve a greater element of subjective assessment than other R&D indicators; thus, approximately 40% of the OECD countries do not report these data at the national level. Nonetheless, where these data exist, they help differentiate national innovation systems in terms of how their R&D resources contribute to advancing scientific knowledge and developing new technologies.\nHigh basic research/GDP ratios generally reflect the presence of robust academic research centers in the country and/ or a concentration of high-technology industries (such as biotechnology) with patterns of strong investment in basic research (see the section entitled \"International R&D by Performer and Source of Funds\"). Of the OECD countries for which data are available, Switzerland has the highest basic research/GDP ratio at 0.8% (figure 4-19). This is significantly higher than either the U.S. ratio of 0.5% or the Japanese ratio\n\nFigure 4-19 Basic research share of gross domestic product, by country/economy: 2003 or 2004\n\nSwitzerland (2004) Israel (2004)\nFrance (2004) United States (2004)\nDenmark (2003) Iceland (2003)\nSouth Korea (2004) Australia (2004)\nSingapore (2004) Austria (2004) Japan (2004)\nNew Zealand (2003) Czech Republic (2004)\nNorway (2003) Taiwan (2004) Ireland (2004) Hungary (2004) Slovak Republic (2004)\nSpain (2004) Portugal (2003)\nPoland (2004) Russian Federation (2004)\nSlovenia (2004) South Africa (2004)\nArgentina (2004) Mexico (2003)\nRomania (2004) China (2004)\n\n0.52 0.48 0.46 0.46 0.44 0.42 0.42 0.39 0.38 0.38 0.33 0.28 0.28 0.27 0.26 0.21 0.20 0.19 0.18 0.16 0.16 0.16 0.11 0.11 0.08 0.07\n\n0.84 0.76\n\n0\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n\nBasic research/GDP (%)\n\nGDP = gross domestic product NOTE: Countries with same values sorted alphabetically.

Switzerland, a small, high-income country boasting the highest number of Nobel prizes, patents, and science citations per capita worldwide, devoted almost 30% of its R&D to basic research in 2004 despite having an industrial R&D share comparable with the United States and Japan. The differences among the Swiss, U.S., and Japanese character-ofwork shares reflect both the high concentration of chemical and pharmaceutical R&D in Swiss industrial R&D, as well as the \"niche strategy\" of focusing on specialty products adopted by many Swiss high-technology industries.\nChina, despite its growing investment in R&D, reports among the lowest basic research/GDP ratios (0.07%), below Romania (0.08%) and Mexico (0.11%). With its emphasis on applied research and development aimed at short-term economic development, China follows the pattern set by Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan. In each of these economies, basic research accounts for 15% or less of total R&D (figure 4-20). Singapore also followed this pattern, but since 2000, its expenditures on basic research have grown faster than its total R&D. In 2000, 12% of Singapore's R&D was basic research, but in 2004 this share was 19%, on par with the United States.\n\nFigure 4-20 Basic research share of R&D, by country/economy: 2003 or 2004\n\nSlovak Republic (2004) New Zealand (2003) Poland (2004) Hungary (2004) Switzerland (2004)\nCzech Republic (2004) Mexico (2003)\nPortugal (2003) Argentina (2004) Australia (2004)\nFrance (2004) Ireland (2004) Romania (2004) Singapore (2004) Spain (2004) United States (2004) Denmark (2003) South Africa (2004) Austria (2004)\nIsrael (2004) Iceland (2003) Norway (2003) South Korea (2004) Russian Federation (2004) Japan (2004) Taiwan (2004) Slovenia (2004)\nChina (2004)\n\n41 33 32 30 29 26 26 26 25 24 24 22 21 19 19 19 18 18 17 17 16 16 15 14 12 12 11 6\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\nBasic research/R&D (%)\n\nNOTE: Countries with same values sorted alphabetically.\n\nSOURCE: Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Main Science and Technology Indicators (2006).\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\f4-42 \n\nChapter 4. Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nInternational R&D by Performer and Source of Funds\nR&D performance patterns by sector are broadly similar across countries, but national sources of support differ considerably. In each of the G-8 countries, the industrial sector is the largest performer of R&D (table 4-13). Industry's share of R&D performance ranged from 48% in Italy to more than 75% in Japan and South Korea; it was 71% in the United States. In China, much of the recent growth in R&D expenditures has occurred in the business sector, which performed 68% of China's R&D in 2005, up from 60% in 2000. In most countries, industrial R&D is financed primarily by the business sector. A notable exception is the Russian Federation,\n\nwhere government was the largest source of industrial R&D funding in 2005 (appendix table 4-37).\nIn all of the G-8 countries except Russia, the academic sector was the second largest performer of R&D (representing from 13% to 38% of R&D performance in each country). In Russia, government is the second largest R&D performer, accounting for 26% of its R&D performance in 2005. Government-performed R&D accounted for 22% of China's R&D in 2005, down from 32% in 2000.\nGovernment and industry together account for more than three-quarters of the R&D funding in each of the G-8 countries, although their respective contributions vary (table 4-14). The industrial sector provided as much as 75% of R&D fund-\n\nTable 4-13 R&D expenditures for selected countries, by performing sector: Most recent year\n(Percent)\n\nCountry\n\nIndustry\n\nHigher education\n\nGovernment\n\nOther nonprofit\n\nSouth Korea (2005).........................................\n\n76.9\n\n9.9\n\n11.9\n\n1.4\n\nJapan (2004) ...................................................\n\n75.2\n\n13.4\n\n9.5\n\n1.9\n\nGermany (2005) ..............................................\n\n69.9\n\n16.5\n\n13.6\n\nNA\n\nUnited States (2006) .......................................\n\n71.1\n\n13.7\n\n11.0\n\n4.2\n\nChina (2005) ...................................................\n\n68.3\n\n9.9\n\n21.8\n\nNA\n\nRussian Federation (2005)..............................\n\n68.0\n\n5.8\n\n26.1\n\n0.2\n\nUnited Kingdom (2004)...................................\n\n63.0\n\n23.4\n\n10.3\n\n3.3\n\nFrance (2005)..................................................\n\n61.9\n\n19.5\n\n17.3\n\n1.2\n\nCanada (2006) ................................................\n\n52.4\n\n38.4\n\n8.8\n\n0.5\n\nItaly (2004) ......................................................\n\n47.8\n\n32.8\n\n17.9\n\n1.5\n\nNA = not available\n\nSOURCES: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, National Patterns of R&D Resources (annual series); and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Main Science and Technology Indicators (2006).\n\nScience & Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nTable 4-14 R&D expenditures for selected countries, by source of funds: Most recent year\n(Percent)\n\nCountry\n\nIndustry\n\nGovernment\n\nOther domestic\n\nAbroad\n\nCanada (2006) ................................................\n\n46.7\n\n33.7\n\n11.0\n\n8.5\n\nChina (2005) ...................................................\n\n67.0\n\n26.3\n\nNA\n\n0.9\n\nFrance (2004)..................................................\n\n51.7\n\n37.6\n\n1.9\n\n8.8\n\nGermany (2004) ..............................................\n\n66.8\n\n30.4\n\n0.4\n\n2.5\n\nJapan (2004) ...................................................\n\n74.8\n\n18.1\n\n6.8\n\n0.3\n\nRussian Federation (2005)..............................\n\n30.0\n\n62.0\n\n0.5\n\n7.6\n\nSouth Korea (2005).........................................\n\n75.0\n\n23.0\n\n1.3\n\n0.7\n\nUnited Kingdom (2004)...................................\n\n44.2\n\n32.8\n\n5.8\n\n17.3\n\nUnited States (2006) .......................................\n\n65.6\n\n28.6\n\n5.8\n\nNA\n\nNA = not available\n\nNOTES: Separate data on foreign sources of R&D funding unavailable for United States but included in sector totals.

Government provided the largest share of Russia's R&D (62%), and although recent data for Italy are not available, its government funded 50% of Italy's R&D in 1999. In the remaining six G-8 nations, government was the second largest source of R&D funding, ranging from 18% of total R&D funding in Japan to 38% in France.\nIn nearly all OECD countries, the government's share of total R&D funding declined during the 1980s and 1990s as the role of the private sector in R&D grew considerably (figure 4-21). In 2000, 28% of all OECD R&D was funded from government sources, down from 44% in 1981. The relative decline of government R&D funding was the result of budgetary constraints, economic pressures, and changing priorities in government funding (especially the relative reduction in defense R&D in several of the major R&D-performing countries, notably France, the United Kingdom, and, until rather recently, the United States). This trend also reflected the growth in business R&D spending during this period, irrespective of government R&D spending patterns. However, since 2000, government funding of R&D has grown in the OECD relative to funding from the business sector. In 2004, governments funded 30% of all OECD R&D.\nNot all countries track the amount of domestic R&D that is funded by foreign sources, but of those that do, the United Kingdom reports a relatively large amount of R&D funding from abroad (17% in 2004) (table 4-14). Businesses in the United States also receive foreign R&D funding; however, these data are not separately reported in U.S. R&D statistics and are included in the figures reported for industry. Therefore, the industry share of R&D funding for the United States is overstated compared with the industry shares for countries where foreign sources of R&D funding are reported separately from domestic sources.\n\nFigure 4-21 Total OECD R&D, by funding sector: 1981\u00ad2004\n\nPercent\n\n100\n\nOther\n\n80\n\n60\n\nIndustry\n\n40\n\n20\n\nGovernment\n\n0 1981 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004\nOECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development SOURCE: OECD, Main Science and Technology Indicators (2006). See appendix table 4-39.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nIndustrial Sector\nThe structure of industrial R&D varies substantially among countries in terms of both sector concentration and sources of funding. Because industrial firms account for the largest share of total R&D performance in each of the G-8 countries and most OECD countries, differences in industrial structure can help explain international differences in more aggregated statistics such as R&D/GDP. For example, countries with higher concentrations of R&D-intensive industries (such as communications equipment manufacturing) are likely to also have higher R&D/GDP ratios than countries whose industrial structures are weighted more heavily toward less R&D-intensive industries.\nSector Focus Using internationally comparable data, no one industry\naccounted for more than 16% of total business R&D in the United States in 2004 (figure 4-22; appendix table 4-42) (OECD 2006d). This is largely a result of the size of business R&D expenditures in the United States, which makes it difficult for any one sector to dominate. However, the diversity of R&D investment by industry in the United States is also an indicator of how the nation's accumulated stock of knowledge and well-developed S&T infrastructure have made it a popular location for R&D performance in a broad range of industries.27\nCompared with the United States, many of the other countries shown in figure 4-22 display much higher industry and sector concentrations. In countries with less business R&D, high sector concentrations can result from the activities of one or two large companies. This pattern is notable in Finland, where the radio, television, and communications equipment industry accounted for almost half of business R&D in 2004. This high concentration most likely reflects the activities of one company, Nokia, the world's largest manufacturer of cellular phones (see also table 4-6 in sidebar, \"R&D Expenses of Public Corporations\"). By contrast, South Korea's high concentration (47% of business R&D in 2004) of R&D in this industry is not the result of any one or two companies, but reflects the structure of its export-oriented economy. South Korea is one of the world's top producers of electronic goods, and among its top export commodities are semiconductors, cellular phones, and computers (see sidebar, \"R&D in the ICT Sector\").\nOther industries also exhibit relatively high concentrations of R&D by country. Automotive manufacturers rank among the largest R&D-performing companies in the world (see sidebar, \"R&D Expenses of Public Corporations\"). Because of this, the countries that are home to the world's major automakers also boast the highest concentration of R&D in the motor vehicles industry. This industry accounts for 32% of Germany's business R&D, 26% of the Czech Republic's, and 19% of Sweden's, reflecting the operations of automakers such as DaimlerChrysler and Volkswagen in Germany, Skoda in the Czech Republic, and Volvo and Saab\n\n\f4-44 \n\nChapter 4.

Japan, France, South Korea, and Italy are also home to large R&D-performing firms in this industry.\nThe pharmaceuticals industry is less geographically concentrated than the automotive industry but is still prominent in several countries. The pharmaceuticals industry accounts for 20% or more of business R&D in Denmark, the United Kingdom, Belgium, and Sweden. Denmark, the largest performer of pharmaceutical R&D in Europe, is home to Novo Nordisk, a world leader in the manufacture and marketing of diabetes-related drugs and industrial enzymes, and H. Lundbeck, a research-based company specializing in psychiatric and neurological pharmaceuticals. The United Kingdom is the second largest performer of pharmaceutical R&D in Europe and is home to GlaxoSmithKline, the second largest pharmaceutical company in the world in terms of R&D expenditures in 2003 and 2004 (table 4-6).\nThe office, accounting, and computing machinery industry represents only a small share of business R&D in most countries. Among OECD countries (appendix table 4-42), only the Netherlands and Japan report double-digit concentration of business R&D in this industry, 24% (2004) and 13% (2003), respectively. The Netherlands is the home of Royal Philips Electronics, the largest electronics company in Europe.\nOne of the more significant trends in both U.S. and international industrial R&D activity has been the growth of R&D in the service sector. In the European Union (EU), service-sector R&D has grown from representing 9% of business R&D in 1993 to 15% in 2003. In 2003, the EU's service-sector R&D nearly equaled that of its motor vehicles industry and more than doubled that of its aerospace industry. According to national statistics for recent years, the service sector accounted for less than 10% of total industrial R&D performance in only four of the countries shown in figure 4-22 (Japan, Germany, France, and South Korea). Among the countries listed in this figure, the service sector accounted for as little as 7% of business R&D in South Korea to as much as 41% in Australia, and it accounted for 29% of total business R&D in the United States. Information and communications technologies (ICT) services account for a substantial share of the service R&D totals (see sidebar, \"R&D in the ICT Sector\").\nSources of Industrial R&D Funding Most of the funding for industrial R&D in each of the\nG-8 countries is provided by the business sector, and in most OECD countries, government financing accounted for a small and declining share of total industrial R&D performance during the 1980s and 1990s (figure 4-23). In 1981, government provided 21% of the funds used by industry in conducting R&D within OECD countries. By 2000, government's funding share of industrial R&D had fallen to 7% but rose slightly to 8% in 2004. Among G-8 countries, government financing of industrial R&D performance shares ranged from as little as 1% in Japan in 2004 to 54% in Russia in 2005 (appendix table 4-37).

The role of foreign funding varies by country, accounting for less than 1% of industrial R&D in Japan to as much as 23% in the United Kingdom in 2004.

Year-to-year variations in this measure can reflect changes in ownership of businesses conducting R&D in a country as well as changes in the level of foreign investment in the country.\nThis funding predominantly comes from foreign corporations and can be viewed as an indicator of the globalization of industrial R&D. However, some of this funding also comes\n\nfrom foreign governments and other foreign organizations. For European countries, growth in foreign sources of R&D funds may reflect the expansion of coordinated European Community (EC) efforts to foster cooperative shared-cost research through its European Framework Programmes.28\nThere are no data on foreign funding sources of U.S. R&D performance. However, data on investments by foreign MNCs provide some indication of this activity for the\n\nR&D in the ICT Sector\n\nInformation and communications technologies (ICTs) play an increasingly important role in the economies of OECD member countries. Both the production and use of these technologies contribute to output and productivity growth. Compared with other industries, ICT industries are among the most R&D intensive, with their products and services embodying increasingly complex technology. Because R&D data are often unavailable for detailed industries, for the purpose of this analysis, ICT industries include the following International Standard Industrial Classification categories:\n Manufacturing industries: 30 (office, accounting, and computer machinery), 32 (radio, television, and communications equipment), and 33 (instruments, watches, and clocks)\n Services industries: 64 (post and communications) and 72 (computer software and related activities) (OECD 2002)\nThe ICT sector accounted for more than one-quarter of total business R&D in 11 of the 19 OECD countries shown in figure 4-25, and more than half of total business R&D in Finland, Ireland, and South Korea. ICT industries accounted for 37% of the business R&D in the United States and 32% of Japanese business R&D. Of the other G-7 countries, Canada comes closest to matching the ICT R&D concentration of the United States and Japan.\n\nFigure 4-25 Industrial R&D by information and communications technologies sector for selected countries and European Union: 2003 or 2004\n\nFinland (2004)\n\n52.4\n\n12.3\n\nIreland (2004) South Korea\n(2004) U.S. (2004)\nCanada (2004)\nSweden (2003)\n\n20.7\n\n36.5\n\n50\n\n5\n\n23 22.3\n28.6\n\n13.5 12.6\n4.1\n\nManufacturing Services\n\nJapan (2003)\n\n30.1\n\n2.1\n\nNetherlands (2004)\n\n28.1\n\n3.5\n\nDenmark (2004) 13.5\n\n17.7\n\nFrance (2003)\n\n20.4\n\n8.1\n\nNorway (2004) 11.7 15.8\n\nEU (2003) 18.4 5.6\n\nBelgium (2004) 14.2 9.5\n\nItaly (2004) 17.5 5.7\n\nUK (2004) 9.1 12.8\n\nAustralia (2003) 8.4 13.5\n\nSpain (2004) 6 12.1\n\nCzech Republic (2004)\n\n5.2\n\n8.7\n\nPoland (2004) 5.7 5.9\n\nGermany (2004) 17.7\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Percent\nEU = European Union; UK = United Kingdom NOTE: Information and communications technologies service-sector R&D data not available for Germany.

Among G-8 countries, universities accounted for as little as 6% of total R&D in Russia to as much as 38% in Canada, and they accounted for 14% of U.S. total R&D (figure 4-26). In Asia, the academic sector generally performs a small share of national R&D in financial terms, accounting for 13% or less of total R&D expenditures in Japan, China, South Korea, and Taiwan.\nFigure 4-26 Academic R&D share of all R&D for selected countries/economies and all OECD: Most recent year\nTurkey (2004) Greece (2005) Portugal (2005) Canada (2006) Mexico (2003)\nItaly (2004) Poland (2005) Norway (2005)\nSpain (2005) New Zealand (2003)\nIreland (2005) Netherlands (2004)\nAustralia (2004) Austria (2005)\nArgentina (2005) Hungary (2005)\nSingapore (2005) Denmark (2005)\nUnited Kingdom (2004) Switzerland (2004) Belgium (2005) Iceland (2003) South Africa (2004) Sweden (2005)\nSlovak Republic (2005) France (2005) Finland (2006)\nAll OECD (2004) Germany (2005) Czech Republic (2005)\nIsrael (2005) United States (2006)\nJapan (2004) Taiwan (2004) Romania (2004) South Korea (2005)\nChina (2005) Slovenia (2005) Russian Federation (2005) Luxembourg (2005)\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Percent\nOECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\nSOURCES: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, National Patterns of R&D Resources (annual series); and OECD, Main Science and Technology Indicators (2006).\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nEach of these countries also reports relatively low amounts of basic research as a share of total R&D (figure 4-20).\nSource of Funds For most countries, the government is now, and historical-\nly has been, the largest source of academic research funding (see sidebar, \"Government Funding Mechanisms for Academic Research\"). However, in each of the G-7 countries for\nGovernment Funding Mechanisms for Academic Research\nBecause U.S. universities generally do not maintain data on departmental research, U.S. totals are understated relative to the R&D effort reported for other countries. The national totals for Europe, Canada, and Japan include the research component of general university fund (GUF) block grants provided by all levels of government to the academic sector. These funds can support departmental R&D programs that are not separately budgeted. GUF is not equivalent to basic research. The U.S. federal government does not provide research support through a GUF equivalent, preferring instead to support specific, separately budgeted R&D projects, usually to address the objectives of the federal agencies that provide the R&D funds. However, some state government funding probably does support departmental research at public universities in the United States.\nThe treatment of GUF is one of the major areas of difficulty in making international R&D comparisons. In many countries, governments support academic research primarily through large block grants that are used at the discretion of each individual higher education institution to cover administrative, teaching, and research costs. Only the R&D component of GUF is included in national R&D statistics, but problems arise in identifying the amount of the R&D component and the objective of the research. Government GUF support is in addition to support provided in the form of earmarked, directed, or project-specific grants and contracts (funds for which can be assigned to specific socioeconomic categories). In the United States, the federal government (although not necessarily state governments) is much more directly involved in choosing which academic research projects are supported than are national governments in Europe and elsewhere. In each of the European G-7 countries, GUF accounts for 50% or more of total government R&D to universities, and in Canada it accounts for roughly 45% of government academic R&D support. These data indicate not only relative international funding priorities, but also funding mechanisms and philosophies regarding the best methods for financing academic research.\n\n\f4-48 \n\nChapter 4.

Business funding of academic R&D for all OECD countries combined peaked in 2000 at 7% but declined to 6% in 2004. In the United States, it slipped to 5% in 2003, where it has since remained. Among OECD countries, the business sector's role in funding academic R&D is most prominent in Germany where the industry-funded share of academic R&D is twice that of all OECD members combined (figure 4-27). The business sector plays an even greater role in other countries, however. In 2004, the business sector funded 37% of China's academic R&D and 33% of Russia's. With the launching in early 2007 of the European Research Council, a pan-European funding agency established as part of the EU's Seventh Research Framework Programme, the EU hopes to provide additional support to academic research. The European Research Council, with a 7-year budget of 7.5 billion (approximately $10 billion), will employ a competitive peer-review process similar to that employed by various government agencies in the United States to select grant recipients.\nS&E Fields Most countries supporting a substantial level of academic\nR&D devote a larger proportion of their R&D to engineering and social sciences than does the United States (table 4-15).\n\nTable 4-15 Share of academic R&D expenditures, by country and S&E field: 2002 or 2003\n(Percent distribution)\n\nField\n\nU.S (2003)\n\nAcademic R&D expenditure (PPP $billions) .......

This is consistent with the emphases in health and biomedical sciences for which the United States is known. Japan, the country with the second largest amount of academic R&D ($16 billion in 2004, approximately onethird of the U.S. amount) places a roughly equal emphasis on engineering and medical sciences. Together, these two fields account for half of Japan's academic R&D expenditures.\nGovernment R&D Priorities\nAnalyzing public expenditures for R&D by major socioeconomic objectives shows how government priorities differ between countries and change over time. Within the OECD, the defense share of governments' R&D financing declined from 43% in 1986 to 28% in 2001 (table 4-16). Much of this decline was driven by the United States, where the defense share of the government's R&D budget dropped from 69% in 1986 to 50% in 2001. The defense share of the U.S. gov-\n\nernment's R&D budget is projected to have grown to 58% in 2006 (appendix table 4-41).\nNotable shifts also occurred in the composition of OECD countries' governmental nondefense R&D support over the past two decades. In terms of broad socioeconomic objectives, government R&D shares increased most for health and the environment. Growth in health-related R&D financing was particularly strong in the United States, whereas many of the other OECD countries reported relatively higher growth in environmental research programs. In the United States, health-related R&D has accounted for more than half of the government's nondefense R&D budget since 2000. Throughout the OECD, the relative share of government R&D support for economic development programs declined from 25% in 1981 to 15% in 2005.

See appendix table 4-41. Science and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\ngovernment R&D share in most countries outside the United States. In recent years, the defense share was relatively high in the United Kingdom and France at 31% and 22%, respectively, but was 6% or less in Germany, Italy, Canada, and Japan. In 2005, South Korea allocated 13% of its government R&D budget for defense-related activities.\nJapan committed 17% of its governmental R&D support to energy-related activities, reflecting the country's historical concern over its high dependence on foreign sources of energy. Industrial production and technology is the leading socioeconomic objective for R&D in South Korea, accounting for 27% of its government's R&D budget. This funding is primarily oriented toward the development of science-intensive industries and is aimed at increasing economic efficiency and technological development. Industrial technology programs accounted for less than 1% of the U.S. total. This figure, which includes mostly R&D funding by NIST, is understated relative to most other countries as a result of data compilation differences. In part, the low U.S. industrial development share reflects the expectation that\n\nfirms will finance industrial R&D activities with their own funds; in part, government R&D that may be indirectly useful to industry is often funded with other purposes in mind such as defense and space (and is therefore classified under other socioeconomic objectives).\nCompared with other countries, France and South Korea invested relatively heavily in nonoriented research at 18% and 21% of government R&D appropriations, respectively. The U.S. government invested 6% of its R&D budget in nonoriented research, largely through the activities of NSF and DOE. However, differences in countries' classification practices affect the size of this apparent gap.\nR&D by Multinational Corporations\nThe internationalization of R&D through foreign direct investment (FDI) by MNCs is one indicator of increasing globalization of innovation activities (Carlsson 2006; OECD 2006c). Related indicators include international trade and cross-country business alliances, which are discussed later\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 4-51\n\nForeign Direct Investment in R&D\n\nForeign direct investment (FDI) refers to the ownership of productive assets outside the home country by multinational corporations (MNCs). More specifically, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) defines direct investment as ownership or control of 10% or more of the voting securities of a business in another country (BEA 1995). A company located in one country but owned or controlled by a parent company in another country is known as an affiliate. Affiliate data used in this section are for majority-owned affiliates, i.e., those in which the ownership stake of parent companies is more than 50%. Statistics on R&D by affiliates of foreign companies in the United States and by foreign affiliates of U.S. MNCs and their parent companies are part of operations data obtained from BEA's Survey of Foreign Direct Investment in the United States (FDIUS) and BEA's Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad (USDIA), respectively. Operations data exclude depository institutions and are on a fiscal-year basis.\nGlobal R&D supports a range of objectives, from technology adaptation to the development of new prod-\n\nucts or services (Kumar 2001; Niosi 1999). The location decision for global R&D sites is driven by market- and science-based factors, including cost considerations, the investment climate, the pull of large markets, and the search for location-specific expertise (von Zedtwitz and Gassmann 2002). Furthermore, the relative importance of these factors is likely to vary depending on the industry, the technology objectives of the overseas activity, and host country characteristics relative to those of home countries. For example, in a recent study examining motives to locate R&D overseas, Thursby and Thursby (2006) report that the size of output markets and the quality of R&D personnel are the top \"attractors\" for FDI R&D in emerging markets, whereas the activities associated with strong research universities remain a key factor for R&D in the home market or in overseas developed economies. Barriers or challenges include managing and coordinating knowledge on a global scale and intellectual property protection.\n\nin this chapter. International R&D links are particularly strong between U.S. and European companies, especially in pharmaceutical, computer, and transportation equipment manufacturing. More recently, certain developing or newly industrialized economies are emerging as hosts of U.S.-owned R&D, including China, Singapore, and India. For general information about R&D by MNCs, see sidebar, \"Foreign Direct Investment in R&D.\"\nU.S. Affiliates of Foreign Companies\nMajority-owned affiliates of foreign companies located in the United States performed $29.9 billion in U.S. R&D expenditures in 2004, little changed from 2003.29 However, between 1999 and 2004, R&D by these affiliates increased faster than overall industrial R&D in the United States (2.1%\n\non an annual average rate basis after adjusting for inflation, compared with 0.2%). Currently, there are no data on the R&D character of work for MNCs separate from the national trends discussed earlier in this chapter. However, an interagency project involving NSF, the Census Bureau, and BEA is aimed, in part, at developing these data, not only for affiliates of foreign MNCs in the United States, but also for parents of U.S. MNCs discussed below. (See sidebar, \"Linking MNC Data From International Investment and Industrial R&D Surveys.\")\nIn 2004, manufacturing accounted for 70% of U.S. affiliates' R&D, including 34% in chemicals (of which 86% were in pharmaceuticals), 13% in transportation equipment, and 11% in computer and electronic products (table 4-17; appendix table 4-44). U.S. affiliates owned by European parent companies accounted for three-fourths ($22.6 of $29.9 bil-\n\nLinking MNC Data From International Investment and Industrial R&D Surveys\n\nAn ongoing data development project aims to integrate the statistical information from the BEA's international investment surveys with the NSF/Census Survey of Industrial Research and Development. Such data sharing among federal statistical agencies has been facilitated by the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act of 2002. Combining technological and investment data from these separate but complementary sources will facilitate a better assessment of globalization trends in R&D and technological innovation. The initial methodological study (completed in 2005) demonstrated not only the feasibility of such a linkage, but also its utility.\n\nA combined preliminary dataset provided information for the first time on R&D expenditures by U.S. and foreign MNCs by character of work (basic research, applied research, development). The study also has produced tangible benefits for the participating agencies, including improvements in survey sampling and the quality of reported data. As a result of these promising initial results, the three participating agencies are considering future work in this area. For more information, see NSF/SRS (2007e) and Census Bureau et al.

German-owned affiliates classified in transportation equipment performed $2.6 billion of R&D, or 68% of all U.S. affiliates' R&D in this industry and 43% of total R&D performed by German-owned U.S. affiliates (table 4-17). On the other hand, affiliates owned by Swiss, British, and French parent companies performed about three-fourths of U.S. affiliates' R&D in chemicals (which includes pharmaceuticals). British-owned affiliates performed 38% of U.S. affiliates' R&D in computers and electronic products, whereas Japanese-owned affiliates accounted for just under half of R&D expenditures in professional, scientific, and technical services.\nU.S. MNCs and Their Overseas R&D\nMajority-owned foreign affiliates of U.S. MNCs (henceforth, foreign affiliates) performed $27.5 billion in R&D abroad in 2004 after adjusting for inflation, up $4.7 billion or 17.4% from 2003, which was the largest annual increase since a 22% rise in 1999.30 In general, changes in FDI R&D reflect a combination of activities in existing facilities, the acquisition of R&D-performing companies, and the establishment of new industrial laboratories or other facilities en-\n\ngaged in technical activities. However, available data do not allow for distinguishing between these FDI alternatives.\nU.S. MNCs comprise U.S. parent companies and their foreign affiliates.31 Since 1994, at least 85% of the combined global R&D expenditures by U.S. MNCs were performed at home (table 4-18).\nAt the same time, however, foreign affiliates' R&D expenditures and value-added by foreign affiliates grew at a faster rate than U.S. parents' after adjusting for inflation. Consequently, the share of foreign affiliates' R&D expenditures within U.S. MNCs increased from 11.5% in 1994 to 15.3% in 2004, comparable with the increase in their valueadded share from 23.5% to 27.1% over the same period.\nPerhaps more revealing than aggregate figures are changes in the geographic distribution of these expenditures, reflecting the changing dynamics of international R&D (figure 4-30). In 1994, major developed economies or regions (Canada, Europe, and Japan) accounted for 90% of overseas R&D expenditures by U.S. MNCs. By 2001, this combined share was down to 80%. However, Europe's share rebounded from an all-time low of 61% in 2001 to 66% in 2004, representing slightly more than two-thirds of the $4.7 billion increase in 2004, driven by affiliates in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Switzerland.

In contrast, the shares of foreign affiliates located in China and Singapore increased from 0.4% and 9.4%, respectively, to 12.6% and 14.4%. Other countries with sizable 2004 shares within this region include Australia (9.5%), Taiwan (7.4%), Malaysia (6.1%), and South Korea (5.0%). Notably, R&D by affiliates located in India doubled from $81 million in 2003 to $163 million in 2004, increasing the share within this region to 3.3%.\nBrazil and Mexico have represented around 80% or more of R&D expenditures by U.S. MNCs in Latin America since 1994. Finally, Israel and South Africa represent virtually all of the R&D expenditures by U.S. MNCs in their respective regions over the same period (appendix table 4-45).\nIn 2004, three manufacturing industries accounted for most foreign-affiliate R&D: transportation equipment (28.1%), chemicals (including pharmaceuticals) (22.7%), and computer and electronic products (19.2%) (table 4-19; appendix table 4-46). Within the nonmanufacturing sector, the professional, technical, and scientific services industry (which includes R&D and computer services) accounted for 7.7%. The industry distribution in European locations is similar to the average across all host countries, whereas at least half of affiliates' R&D expenditures in Canada and Japan are performed by affiliates classified in transportation equipment and chemicals, respectively. Affiliates classified in computer and electronic products performed 63.1% of U.S.-owned R&D in Israel and 42.7% of U.S.-owned R&D in the Asia-Pacific region, excluding Japan.\nTechnology Linkages: Contract R&D, Trade in R&D Services, Business Alliances, and Federal Technology Transfer\nCollaboration with external technology sources, including universities and federal laboratories, has long played a key role in U.S. industrial innovation (Bozeman 2000; Mowery 1983; Rosenberg and Nelson 1994). Increasingly, however, industrial innovation requires partners, resources, and ideas outside company and national boundaries (Chesbrough, Vanhaverbeke, and West 2006; EIU 2006; IBM 2006; IRI 2007). (See sidebar, \"A Window Into Open or Collaborative Innovation.\") Factors behind this trend include the complex and multidisciplinary nature of scientific research, coupled with the increased relevance of science for industrial technology in a globally competitive environment. Several terms in the academic and business literature capture diverse but related dimensions of this new environment, including open or collaborative innovation, networked R&D, innovation sourcing, and technology markets.32 The resulting exchanges or joint activities involve customers, suppliers, competitors, and public institutions such as universities and government agencies.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 4-55\n\nTable 4-19 R&D performed abroad by majority-owned foreign affiliates of U.S. parent companies, by selected NAICS industry of affiliate and country/region: 2004\n(Millions of current U.S. dollars)\n\nManufacturing\n\nNonmanufacturing\n\nCountry/region\n\nAll industries\n\nTotal\n\nProfessional,\n\nComputer\n\ntechnical,\n\nand\n\nelectronic\n\nelectronic Electrical Transportation\n\nscientific\n\nChemicals Machinery products equipment equipment Information services\n\nAll countries.................... 27,529 23,288 6,254\n\n791\n\n5,283\n\n551\n\n7,741\n\n843\n\n2,120\n\nCanada ....................... 2,702 2,517\n\n503\n\n26\n\n472\n\n16\n\n1,334\n\n38\n\nD\n\nEurope ........................ 18,148 15,198 4,451\n\n656\n\n2,117\n\n422\n\n5,750\n\n317\n\n1,477\n\nBelgium ................... 628\n\n465\n\nD\n\n18\n\nD\n\n12\n\n23\n\n0\n\n80\n\nFrance ..................... 1,854 1,762\n\n912\n\n75\n\n136\n\n12\n\n422\n\nD\n\n23\n\nGermany.................. 4,693 4,144\n\n269\n\n190\n\n543\n\n240\n\n2,462\n\n11\n\nD\n\nSweden ................... 1,525 1,483\n\n83\n\n11\n\n51\n\nD\n\nD\n\n1\n\nD\n\nSwitzerland.............. 868\n\n361\n\n104\n\n31\n\n76\n\n4\n\n15\n\n10\n\n236\n\nUnited Kingdom ...... 5,462 4,434 1,711\n\n177\n\n762\n\n34\n\n1,339\n\n46\n\n849\n\nAsia and Pacific .......... 4,934 4,426 1,164\n\n81\n\n2,108\n\n95\n\n435\n\nD\n\nD\n\nAustralia .................. 471\n\n426\n\n92\n\nD\n\nD\n\n1\n\n222\n\n*\n\nD\n\nChina ....................... 622\n\n538\n\n18\n\n7\n\n468\n\nD\n\n5\n\nD\n\n21\n\nHong Kong .............. 220\n\n196\n\n4\n\n*\n\nD\n\n2\n\n0\n\nD\n\nD\n\nJapan ...................... 1,742 1,552 1,004\n\n45\n\n244\n\nD\n\n114\n\n127\n\nD\n\nSingapore ................ 711\n\n698\n\n8\n\n*\n\n677\n\nD\n\nD\n\n8\n\n4\n\nTaiwan ..................... 363\n\n349\n\n11\n\n6\n\n14\n\n0\n\nD\n\nD\n\n1\n\nLatin America/OWH .... 882\n\n581\n\n124\n\n26\n\n66\n\n16\n\n206\n\nD\n\nD\n\nBrazil ....................... 340\n\n328\n\n67\n\n21\n\n61\n\nD\n\n144\n\n2\n\n5\n\nMexico .....................\n\nD\n\n199\n\n36\n\n5\n\n1\n\nD\n\n53\n\n0\n\nD\n\nMiddle East ................. 826\n\n539\n\n6\n\n1\n\n520\n\n1\n\n0\n\nD\n\nD\n\nIsrael........................ 824\n\n539\n\n6\n\n1\n\n520\n\n1\n\n0\n\nD\n\nD\n\nAfrica ...........................\n\n36\n\n27\n\n6\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n16\n\n2\n\n*\n\nSouth Africa.............\n\n30\n\n24\n\n5\n\n*\n\n0\n\n0\n\n16\n\n2\n\n*\n\nD = suppressed to avoid disclosure of confidential information; * = $500,000 NAICS = North American Industry Classification System; OWH = other Western Hemisphere\n\nNOTES: Preliminary 2004 estimates for majority-owned (>50%) nonbank affiliates of nonbank U.S. parents by country of ultimate beneficial owner and industry of affiliate.

Each may interact differently with internal R&D and each present different risks and benefits in terms of innovation strategies and management (Cassiman and Veugelers 2002; Fey and Birkinshaw 2005). In turn, each channel has different implications for public policies aiming at promoting innovation. Indeed, public policies in advanced economies concerned with enhancing growth have evolved to address the many dimensions of industrial innovation. Several policies in the United States have facilitated R&D collaboration among industry, universities, and federal laboratories since the 1980s (see sidebar, \"Major Federal Legislation Related to Cooperative R&D and Technology Transfer\").\nThis section discusses three different types of indicators of knowledge flows and technology linkages: transactions involving R&D, business alliances, and technology transfer\n\nfrom federal sources. Indicators of transactions include domestic contract R&D by R&D-performing companies, exports by U.S. establishments classified in the R&D services industry, and international transactions of R&D services by all companies located in the United States. Not surprisingly, there are differences in scope and methodology across the different sources, as detailed throughout this section. However, each source explores complementary dimensions in the complex web of domestic and international transactions involving R&D and R&D-related services.\nContract R&D Expenses Within the United States\nR&D-performing companies in the United States reported $11.7 billion (including $8.9 billion reported by manufacturers) in R&D contracted out to other domestic companies and\n\n\f4-56 \n\nChapter 4. Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nA Window Into Open or Collaborative Innovation\n\nIndustrial innovation is increasingly global and performed collaboratively, requiring partners, resources, and ideas outside the company and national boundaries (Chesbrough, Vanhaverbeke, and West 2006; OECD 2006c). Knowledge may be generated internally, codeveloped, or acquired from a variety of private and public sources, then further developed for a specific market. Often, to successfully enter the marketplace ahead of competitors, an invention or new organizational method requires a new business model (Chesbrough 2007), as well as complementary assets such as manufacturing, marketing, or distribution capabilities. The latter may also be developed internally, acquired, or outsourced (Howells 2006; Teece 1986). The following excerpts from publications provide a flavor of some of the current industry thinking and activities in this area.\nHarvard Business Review Connect and Develop: Inside Proctor & Gamble's New Model for Innovation\nAs we studied outside sources of innovation, we estimated that for every P&G [Procter & Gamble] researcher there were 200 scientists or engineers elsewhere in the world who were just as good--a total of perhaps 1.5 million people whose talents we could potentially use. But tapping into the creative thinking of inventors and others on the outside would require massive operational changes. We needed to move the company's attitude from resistance to innovations \"not invented here\" to enthusiasm for those `proudly found elsewhere.' And we needed to change how we defined, and perceived, our R&D organization--from 7,500 people inside to 7,500 plus 1.5 million outside, with a permeable boundary between them. (Huston and Sakkab 2006)\nBusiness Week Crowdsourcing: Milk the Masses for Inspiration\nBusiness model innovation is happening at a lightning clip. First there was outsourcing, then open-sourcing, and now crowdsourcing. . . . Crowdsourcing often produces a wealth of ideas, and companies need effective filters to pick the gems. Consider IBM's innovation jam, a two-part brainstorming session launched in July [2006] designed\n\nto tap the collective minds of employees, family members, and customers to target potential areas for innovation. CEO Sam Palmisano will put $100 million into promising ideas. (Hempel 2006).\nChemical & Engineering News Start-Up Firm NineSigma Uses Internet To Match Industrial Clients With Inventive Partners\nIn his 28 years at Procter & Gamble, Paul Stiros says he never doubted the wisdom behind connecting R&D to customer needs. As president and chief executive officer of privately held NineSigma, Stiros heads a firm committed to helping corporations acquire technical innovations that will quickly bring tomorrow's star products to market. . . . Competing firms such as InnoCentive and YourEncore also help corporations get research help outside the usual channels. InnoCentive posts specific problems for corporate customers on the Internet and pays a bounty for solutions. YourEncore connects technology and product development needs of member companies with retirees who have scientific backgrounds. (American Chemical Society 2006)\nBoeing YourEncore and Your Retirement\nBoeing partnered in August 2003 with YourEncore Inc. to provide Boeing retirees with scientific and engineering skills [and] challenging and rewarding project opportunities in various industries, including aerospace, chemical, communications, pharmaceutical and consumer products. Retirees can contribute their expertise to major companies on high-level projects while networking among peers and gaining experience in new industries. . . . \"YourEncore is an ideal opportunity for Boeing retirees to stay intellectually engaged on a part-time basis to the degree the retiree wishes and get fairly compensated,\" said Dick Paul, Boeing Phantom Works* vice president, strategic development and analysis. \"Boeing retirees can join YourEncore and consult either back at Boeing or with other member companies in varied industries.\" (Sopranos 2004)\n*Phantom Works is the advanced R&D unit at Boeing.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 4-57\n\nMajor Federal Legislation Related to Cooperative R&D and Technology Transfer\n\nStevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act (1980). Required federal laboratories to facilitate the transfer of federally owned and originated technology to state and local governments and the private sector.\nBayh-Dole University and Small Business Patent Act (1980). Permitted government grantees and contractors to retain title to federally funded inventions and encouraged universities to license inventions to industry. The act is designed to foster interactions between academia and the business community.\nSmall Business Innovation Development Act (1982). Established the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program within the major federal R&D agencies to increase government funding of research that has commercialization potential within small high-technology companies.\nNational Cooperative Research Act (1984). Encouraged U.S. firms to collaborate on generic, precompetitive research by establishing a rule of reason for evaluating the antitrust implications of research joint ventures. The act was amended in 1993 by the National Cooperative Research and Production Act, which let companies collaborate on production and research activities.\nFederal Technology Transfer Act (1986). Amended the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act to authorize cooperative R&D agreements (CRADAs) between\n\nfederal laboratories and other entities, including other federal agencies, state or local governments, universities and other nonprofit organizations, and industrial companies.\nOmnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (1988). Established the Competitiveness Policy Council to develop recommendations for national strategies and specific policies to enhance industrial competitiveness. The act created the Advanced Technology Program and the Manufacturing Technology Centers within NIST to help U.S. companies become more competitive.\nNational Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act (1989). Amended the Stevenson-Wydler Act to allow government-owned, contractor-operated laboratories to enter into CRADAs. National Cooperative Research and Production Act (1993). Relaxed restrictions on cooperative production activities, enabling research joint venture participants to work together in the application of technologies they jointly acquire.\nTechnology Transfer Commercialization Act (2000). Amended the Stevenson-Wydler Act and the Bayh-Dole Act to improve the ability of government agencies to monitor and license federally owned inventions.\n\nother organizations in 2005, compared with $12.3 billion in 2004, according to NSF data (appendix table 4-50).33 The ratio of contracted-out R&D to company-funded, companyperformed R&D declined from 6.6% in 2004 to 5.7% for all industries in 2005 but remained above 6% for manufacturing (figure 4-31). However, since 1993, these contractedout expenditures have grown faster than company-funded, company-performed expenditures.\nThe relative magnitude of payments for R&D conducted by others varies across industries. In 2005, pharmaceutical companies reported $4.6 billion in contracted-out R&D (appendix table 4-51), or 13.2 % of their company-funded, company-performed R&D, followed by scientific R&D services (11.4%); navigational, measuring, electromedical, and control instruments (7.9%); and motor vehicles, trailers, and parts (7.2%). The ratio was only 2.8% for companies classified in computer and electronic products.\nFor most of the industries highlighted above, close to 80% of contracted-out R&D payments were received by other companies. For scientific R&D services, however, only 53% of these expenditures were received by other companies.34\n\nFigure 4-31 R&D contracted out in United States by manufacturing companies as ratio of companyfunded and -performed R&D: 1993\u00ad2005\nPercent 8\n6\n4\n2\n0 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Survey of Industrial Research and Development (annual series).\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\f4-58 \n\nChapter 4. Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nInternational Trade in R&D Services\nThe international flow of knowledge through trade in services represents the convergence of two recent trends: an increase in R&D performance in the service sector and an increase in transactions with external parties (Arora, Fosfuri, and Gambardella 2001; OECD 2006c). U.S. R&D-related trade in services is a relatively new indicator of international industrial knowledge and technology flows. Other such indicators include FDI, trade in high-technology goods, patent royalties, and license fees (see the section entitled \"R&D by Multinational Corporations\" and also chapter 6). Trade in R&D and technical services are also key to understanding the growing role of services in the U.S. economy and the extent and impact of services \"offshoring \" (GAO 2004; Graham 2007; NAPA 2006).35\nExports by R&D Services Establishments The Service Annual Survey (SAS) conducted by the Cen-\nsus Bureau provides national estimates of total revenues, export revenue, and expenses of establishments (single physical locations at which business is conducted and/or services are provided) classified in NAICS service industries.36 Scientific R&D services (NAICS 5417) cover establishments devoted primarily to R&D, either as stand-alone enterprises or within larger companies.37 Newly available data on export revenues for this industry are based on revenues for basic and applied research, production services for development, testing services, and licensing of intellectual property. In 2005, U.S. establishments classified in NAICS 54171 (physical, engineering, and life sciences) exported $3.0 billion in R&D services, or 3.9% of their total revenue ($76.4 billion) (table 4-20). Notably, this proportion was about twice as large as the export revenue share for all professional, scientific, and technical services in 2004 and 2005.\n\nExports and Imports of R&D Services The preceding discussion of R&D services exports was\nbased on establishments classified in a specific industry sector. The present section examines patterns in services trade, regardless of industry classification, and focuses on research, development, and testing (RDT) services.38 Since 2001, these data have been available for two major categories of customers or suppliers: trade among unaffiliated companies and trade among affiliates of MNCs. In 2005, total exports (affiliated and unaffiliated) of RDT services reached a record $10.1 billion, compared with record imports of $6.7 billion, resulting in a trade surplus of $3.4 billion (figure 4-32). This trade surplus is little changed from the $3.8 billion surplus in 2004 but smaller than trade surpluses (approximately $5 billion) in both 2002 and 2003. Affiliated exports and imports have been larger than unaffiliated exports and imports (table 4-21). Furthermore, affiliated trade has recorded trade surpluses between $4 billion and $5 billion since 2001. However, unaffiliated trade moved from relatively small surpluses (less than $500 million) in the 1990s to small deficits in the early 2000s, reaching a deficit of slightly more than a billion dollars in 2005 (appendix table 4-52) (NSF/SRS 2006c).\nThe prominence of affiliated trade in business services, particularly R&D-related services, may reflect advantages of internally managing, exploiting, and protecting complex or strategic transactions involving proprietary technical information (Caves 1996; McEvily, Eisenhardt, and Prescott 2004). For the United States, the large size of affiliated relative to unaffiliated trade in RDT services is consistent with strong U.S. FDI activity, which increases the number of potential affiliated trading partners. It is also consistent with expanded MNC R&D (see the section entitled \"R&D by Multinational Corporations\"), which increases opportunities for intracompany knowledge flows.\n\nTable 4-20 Estimated total revenue and export revenue for U.S. establishments classified in selected service industries: 2004 and 2005\n(Millions of current dollars)\n\nRevenue\n\nExport revenue\n\nExport revenue as percent of total revenue\n\nService industry\n\nNAICS code 2004\n\n2005\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\nProfessional, scientific, and technical services\n\n(except notaries) ........................................................\n\n54 966,008 1,058,196 18,415 21,670\n\n1.9\n\n2.0\n\nScientific R&D services............................................\n\n5417\n\n74,789 81,539 2,680 3,074\n\n3.6\n\n3.8\n\nR&D in physical, engineering, and life sciences...\n\n54171\n\n69,989 76,381 2,585 2,978\n\n3.7\n\n3.9\n\nR&D in social sciences and humanities ...............\n\n54172\n\n4,800\n\n5,158\n\n95\n\n96\n\n2.0\n\n1.9\n\nNAICS = North American Industry Classification System\n\nNOTES: Data for taxable and nontaxable employer establishments.

Drivers for R&D collaboration include cost and risk reductions afforded by pooling resources, strategic or long-term considerations regarding the acquisition of innovation capabilities or entry into new product markets, and the policy environment, notably antitrust regulation and intellectual property protection. In the United States, restrictions on multifirm cooperative research were loosened by the National Cooperative Research Act in 1984 (Public Law 98\u00ad462), given concerns about the technological leadership and international competitiveness of American firms in the early 1980s.40\n\nFigure 4-32 U.S. trade in research, development, and testing services: 2001\u00ad05\nDollars (billions)\n12 Trade balance\n\n10\n\nExports\n\n8 Imports\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0 2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\nSOURCE: Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. International Services: Cross-Border Trade 1986\u00ad2005, and Sales Through Affiliates, 1986\u00ad2004, http://www.bea.gov/international/intlserv.htm, accessed 4 December 2006.

Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nFederal Technology Transfer and S&T Programs\nIn the late 1980s, concerns about U.S. industrial strength and global competitiveness led to a series of legislative changes that facilitated public-private partnerships involving industry, universities, and government laboratories (NRC 2003). These partnerships can facilitate technology transfer from the research laboratory to the market in support of both public agencies' missions and technology-based economic growth. Federal technology transfer statutes apply to federally owned or originated technology (see sidebar, \"Major Federal Legislation Related to Cooperative R&D and Technology Transfer\"). Federal technology indicators include government-owned patents, licensing, and cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs). This section covers federal technology transfer metrics and federal S&T programs.\nTechnology Transfer Metrics R&D performed at federal laboratories, whether run by\nfederal agencies themselves or by contractors,42 represents a key source for knowledge and technologies supporting both federal agency missions such as defense, health, and energy, as well as economic growth, and general social welfare (Crow and Bozeman 1998; RAND 2003). Technology transfer refers to the exchange or sharing of knowledge, skills, or technologies from sources to users within or across organizations. Federal technology transfer activities and metrics reflect the variety of agency missions, R&D organization and funding structure (e.g., intramural versus extramural laboratories), the character of R&D activities, and the types of potential downstream technologies or users.\nFor example, scientific or technical publications are a major channel for disseminating R&D results by agencies with large intramural basic research such as NIH (at HHS). Agencies also offer direct technical assistance to private users in\n\nsettings such as agricultural extension services (USDA), manufacturing extension services (NIST), and federal laboratories (e.g., DOE and NIST). DOE laboratories and FFRDCs offer technical assistance to industrial and academic researchers in the form of user facilities agreements and \"work-for-others\" agreements. User facilities are advanced scientific facilities, equipment, and software available at DOE laboratories. Work-for-others is work performed for nonfederal sponsors (DOE 2006). In FY 2005, DOE reported about 2,400 workfor-others-agreements and about 2,800 user facility agreements (DOE 2006). In addition, all major U.S. R&D funding agencies, including DOD, HHS, NASA, DOE, and NSF, participate in technology transfer programs involving small businesses and technology entrepreneurs, as described below.\nA major technology transfer channel involves cooperative R&D. In particular, CRADAs are agreements between federal laboratories and industrial firms and other organizations for joint R&D activities with the potential to promote industrial innovation consistent with the agency's mission. Private partners may retain ownership rights or acquire exclusive licensing rights for the developed technologies. Federal agencies are engaged in about 3,000 CRADAs annually (NSB 2006), including about 1,500 reported by DOD and 661 by DOE in FY 2003 (latest year available with comparable CRADA data across agencies).\nA different set of federal technology transfer metrics involves intellectual property measures such as invention disclosures, patents, and licenses (for academic and corporate patents, see chapters 5 and 6, respectively). Invention disclosures may or may not result in a patent application. Patent and invention licenses (which include licenses of patented inventions) are indicators further along the chain of the technology transfer process in which laboratory results may find applications in agency missions or the marketplace. Table 4-22 shows the 2005 distribution for these metrics for selected agencies.43\n\nTable 4-22 Federal technology transfer indicators and intellectual property measures, by selected U.S. agency: FY 2005\n\nDisclosures/patenting/licenses\n\nDOE\n\nDOD\n\nNASA\n\nNIH/FDA\n\nUSDA\n\nInvention disclosures and patenting\n\nInventions disclosed .......................................................... 1,776\n\n1,220\n\n687\n\n388\n\n125\n\nPatent applications filed ....................................................\n\n812\n\n798\n\n154\n\n186\n\n88\n\nPatents issued ...................................................................\n\n467\n\n430\n\n157\n\n66\n\n27\n\nInvention licenses\n\nActive invention licenses.................................................... 1,535\n\n406\n\n345\n\nNA\n\n320\n\nNew invention licenses ......................................................\n\n198\n\n60\n\n90\n\n313\n\n33\n\nNA = not available\n\nDOD = Department of Defense; DOE = Department of Energy; NASA = National Aeronautics and Space Administration; NIH/FDA = National Institutes of Health/Food and Drug Administration; USDA = U.S. Department of Agriculture\n\nNOTE: NASA data for FY 2004.\n\nSOURCES: USDA, FY 2006 Annual Reporting on Agency Technology Transfer (2006); DOD, Report to Congress on the activities of the DOD Office of Technology Transition (2006); DOE, Annual Report on Technology Transfer and Related Technology Partnering Activities at the National Laboratories and Other Facilities \u00ad Fiscal Year 2005 (2006); NASA, Annual Report on Technology Transfer, Programs, Plans, FY 2004 Activities and Achievements (2006); NIH, Office of Technology Transfer Activities, Statistical Tables (2006), http://www.ott.nih.gov/about_nih/statistics.html, accessed 28 February 2007.

Differences in R&D funding structure (intramural versus extramural funding) and the R&D character of work across agencies may drive the agency distribution of these indicators (table 4-8).44\nS&T Programs S&T programs support the development of early-stage\ntechnologies and are key components in the dynamics of technology-based entrepreneurship and innovation (Audretsch, Aldridge, and Oetll 2005; Branscomb and Auerswald 2002). This section briefly describes trends in the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, the Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR), and the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) through the latest data available. The section ends with a brief description of the Technology Innovation Program, which replaces ATP.\nThe SBIR program, created in 1982, leverages existing federal R&D funding toward small companies (those with 500 or fewer employees).45 SBIR's sister program, the STTR program, was created in 1992 to stimulate cooperative R&D and technology transfer involving small businesses and nonprofit organizations, including universities and FFRDCs.46\nStatutory goals of the SBIR program include the promotion of technological innovation through commercialization of federally funded projects and increasing the participation of small firms and companies owned by minorities or disadvantaged individuals in the procurement of federal R&D. The 1992 SBIR reauthorization bill47 stipulated a stronger emphasis on the technology commercialization objectives of the program (NRC 2007).\nAccording to the SBIR statute, federal agencies with extramural R&D obligations exceeding $100 million must set aside a fixed percentage of such obligations for SBIR projects. This set-aside has been 2.5% since FY 1997. As of FY 2005, a total of 11 federal agencies participated in the program, including most recently DHS.48 SBIR has awarded $118.8 billion to more than 89,000 projects through FY 2005. Funded technology areas include computers and electronics, information services, materials, energy, and life sciences applications. In FY 2005, the program awarded $1.9 billion in R&D funding to 6,171 projects (figure 4-34). The upward trend in awards and funding reflects both the increased set-aside percentage over the history of the program, as well as trends in federal funds for extramural R&D. DOD and HHS combined have provided between 60% and 80% of total annual SBIR funds since the program's inception (appendix table 4-54).\nSTTR involves cooperative R&D performed jointly by small businesses and nonprofit research organizations.49 As of FY 2005, five federal agencies with extramural R&D budgets exceeding $1 billion participate in the STTR program: DOD, NSF, DOE, NASA, and HHS. Starting in FY 2004, the required set-aside rose from 0.15% to 0.3%, compared with the 2.5% set-aside for SBIR. From FY 1994 to FY 2005, STTR\n\nFigure 4-34 SBIR awards and funding: 1983\u00ad2005\n\nAwards (bars)\n\n2000 dollars (millions) (line)\n\n7,000\n\n2,000\n\n6,000 5,000\n\n1,800 1,600 1,400\n\n4,000 3,000\n\n1,200 1,000 800\n\n2,000\n\n600\n\n400\n1,000 200\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1983 1985 1987 19891991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 20032005\n\nSBIR = Small Business Innovation Research Program\nSOURCE: Small Business Administration, Small Business Innovation Research Program Annual Report (various years).

The projects have involved more than 1,500 participants, which include established companies and start-ups as well as universities and other nonprofit institutions (appendix table 4-56). In FY 2004, 59 R&D projects were initiated, totaling $270 million in combined program and industry funds. The program received $79 million in FY 2006 and an estimated $40 million in FY 2007. The America COMPETES Act (Public Law 110\u00ad69 signed in August 2007) replaced ATP in favor of a successor program, the Technology Innovation Program (TIP) also housed at the DOC's National Institute of Standards and Technology.51 The goal of the program is to assist U.S. \"businesses and institutions of higher education or other organizations, such as national laboratories and nonprofit research institutions, to support, promote, and accelerate innovation in the United States through high-risk, high-reward research in areas of critical national need.\"52\n\nConclusion\nU.S. R&D expenditures reached an estimated $340 billion in 2006, having risen steadily since 2002, the year expenditures declined for the first time since 1953. In inflationadjusted terms, this increase represents a rather steady 2.5% average annual change over the past 4 years.\n\n\f4-62 \n\nChapter 4. Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nThe business sector accounts for the largest share of U.S. R&D performance. The performance share of this sector peaked in 2000 at 75%, declined following the economic slowdown of 2001 and 2002, but has since leveled to an estimated 71% of U.S. R&D in 2006. The major industrial R&D performers include four manufacturing industries (computer and electronic products; chemicals, including pharmaceuticals and biotechnology; aerospace and defense; and automotive) and two services industries (computer-related services and R&D services). In terms of funding, the industry share peaked at 70% also in 2000, but is estimated to have since dipped somewhat to 64% in 2004 before climbing back to 66% of the 2006 R&D total. On the other hand, the federal share of R&D funding dropped to a low of 25% in 2000. Reflecting primarily increased spending in the areas of defense, health, and counterterrorism, the federal share of R&D funding has inched up in recent years and is estimated at 28% of the R&D funding total in 2006.\nThe international character of the U.S. R&D enterprise may be examined from different perspectives, including comparisons with other countries, business alliances, MNCs, and, according to recently available data, cross-country linkages in the form of exports and imports of R&D services.\nIn 2002 (latest available cross-country data), global R&D expenditures totaled at least $813 billion, largely funded by and performed in developed countries. The United States and Japan accounted for 45% of total performance, and OECD countries as a group for more than three-quarters. Some nonOECD countries are growing in international prominence in R&D. South Korea maintained its sizable R&D effort and, according to OECD calculations, China has rapidly moved into the top group of R&D-performing nations while India and Brazil are expanding their R&D activities. However, a solid basis is lacking for direct comparisons of R&D effort across developed and developing countries, leading to uncertainty in the cross-country relationship of absolute spending magnitudes.\nBetween 1999 and 2004, R&D expenditures by affiliates of foreign companies located in the United States increased faster than overall U.S. industrial R&D (2.1% versus 0.2% annual average rate, inflation-adjusted, respectively). Over the same period, overseas R&D by foreign affiliates of U.S. MNCs increased even faster (6.3% annual average rate, inflation-adjusted), particularly in Asian emerging markets such as China, Singapore, and India. Indeed, the share of R&D by foreign affiliates of U.S. MNCs located in Asian countries except Japan surpassed the shares for affiliates located in Japan for the first time in 1999. In 2004, the former had a share of 11.6%, compared with 6.3% for Japan.\nThe flow of knowledge through trade in services reflects the growing role of services in global innovation and economic activity. U.S. international trade in research, development, and testing services has posted surpluses since 2001. In 2005, exports of these services reached $10.1 billion, compared with imports of $6.7 billion. Furthermore, U.S. trade surpluses in these services have been driven more\n\nby exports from affiliates of foreign MNCs located in the United States rather than by exports from parent companies of U.S. MNCs. This finding is consistent with the growing share these affiliates have in U.S. industrial R&D.\nIn light of the fast pace of international science, technology, and innovation and related policy analysis needs, federal statistical agencies continue to fine-tune their surveys while engaging in interagency and international collaboration. For example, the ability of respondents in industry to answer questions on innovation beyond R&D inputs is being investigated as part of the redesign of the Survey of Industrial R&D. Another strategy for developing new indicators is mining and integrating related data. Planned or ongoing interagency projects include linking data from R&D and international investment surveys and the development of an R&D Satellite Account. The latter not only measures R&D as an investment within GDP, but also serves as a methodology to measure the impact of R&D on productivity and economic growth. Lastly, federal agencies continue to collaborate with international organizations to facilitate comparable data reflecting the ever-changing innovation landscape.\nNotes\n1. In this chapter, adjustment for inflation is based on the GDP implicit price deflator. Because GDP deflators are calculated on an economywide rather than R&D-specific basis, their use should be interpreted as a measure of real resources forgone in engaging in R&D rather than in other activities (such as consumption or physical investment), and not a measure of cost changes in doing research. See appendix table 4-1.\n2. FFRDCs are R&D-performing organizations that are exclusively or substantially financed by the federal government either to meet a particular R&D objective or, in some instances, to provide major facilities at universities for research and associated training purposes. Each FFRDC is administered either by an industrial firm, a nonprofit institution, a university, or a consortium. In some of the statistics provided in this chapter, FFRDCs are included as part of the sector that administers them. In particular, statistics on the industrial sector often include industry-administered FFRDCs because some of the statistics from the NSF Survey of Industrial Research and Development before 2001 cannot be separated from the FFRDC component.\n3. See Godin (2006) for a history of the linear model of innovation.\n4. The latest data available on the state distribution of R&D performance are for 2004. In 2004, $283.4 billion of the $300.1 billion total U.S. R&D could be attributed to expenditures within individual states, with the remainder falling under an undistributed \"other/unknown\" category. Approximately equal shares of the R&D that could not be associated with a particular state were R&D performed by the nonprofit sector and by industry. State totals differ from U.S. totals reported elsewhere for four reasons: some R&D expenditures\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 4-63\n\ncannot be allocated to any of the 50 states or the District of Columbia; nonfederal sources of nonprofit R&D expenditures, totaling an estimated $7.1 billion in 2004, could not be allocated by state; state-level university R&D data have not been adjusted for double-counting of R&D passed through from one academic institution to another; and state R&D data are not converted from fiscal years to calendar years.\n5. Rankings do not take into account the margin of error of estimates from sample surveys.\n6. Federal intramural R&D includes costs associated with the administration of intramural and extramural programs by federal personnel as well as actual intramural R&D performance. This explains the large amount of federal intramural R&D reported within the District of Columbia.\n7. For most manufacturing industries, the Small Business Association has established a size standard of 500 employees. The NSF Survey of Industrial Research and Development does not sample companies with fewer than five employees because of concerns about respondent burden.\n8. A similar measure of R&D intensity is the ratio of R&D to value-added (sales minus the cost of materials). Value-added is often used in studies of productivity because it allows analysts to focus on the economic output attributable to the specific industrial sector in question by subtracting materials produced in other sectors. For a more detailed discussion of value-added, see United Nations System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA 1993). For a discussion of the connection between R&D intensity and technological progress, see Nelson (1988).\n9. Industry-level estimates are complicated by the fact that each company's R&D is reported in only one industry (see sidebar, \"Industry Classification\").\n10. According to NAICS, the utilities industry is limited to establishments engaged in the provision of electric power, natural gas, steam, water, and the removal of sewage. Establishments that provide telephone and other communication services are included in other NAICS industries.\n11. Because federal R&D funding is concentrated among a few companies in a small number of industries, the potential for disclosing information about a particular company is high. Therefore, these data often are suppressed. This prevents the precise tabulation of total R&D performance and the calculation of R&D to net sales ratios for many industries. Appendix table 4-22 presents company-funded R&D to net sales ratios for a wide array of industries.\n12. For a recent study on the role of services industries in R&D and innovation, see Gallaher, Link, and Petrusa (2006).\n13. Suppression of federal R&D funding prohibits the precise tabulation of total R&D performance for some industries (see note 11). Lower-bound analyst estimates are given in cases where potential disclosure of companyreported data or classification issues prevents the publication of total estimates from survey data.\n14. Methodological differences between the PhRMA Annual Membership Survey and the NSF Survey of Industrial Research and Development make it difficult to direct-\n\nly compare estimates from the two surveys. For example, the PhRMA survey definition of R&D includes Phase IV clinical trials (which are trials conducted after the drug is licensed and available for doctors to prescribe), whereas the NSF survey definition does not. Also, the NSF survey sales data may contain income from sources not related to the production of drugs and medicines.\n15. The introduction of a more refined industry classification scheme in 1999 allowed more detailed reporting in nonmanufacturing industries. For the cited 2005 statistic, the R&D expenditures of companies in software, other information, and computer systems design and related services industries were combined. These three industries provided the closest approximation to the broader category cited for earlier years without exceeding the coverage of the broader category.\n16. Suppression of federal R&D funding prohibits the precise tabulation of total R&D performance for some industries (see notes 11 and 13). Lower-bound analyst estimates are given in cases where potential disclosure of companyreported data or classification issues prevents the publication of total estimates from survey data.\n17. NAICS-based R&D estimates are available only back to 1997. Estimates for 1997 and 1998 were bridged from a different industry classification scheme. Total R&D for this sector has grown from $9.2 billion in 1997 to $16.9 billion in 2005.\n18. Because R&D expenses reported on financial documents differ from the data reported on the NSF Survey of Industrial Research and Development, direct comparisons of these sources are not possible. For an explanation of the differences between the two, see Shepherd and Payson (1999).\n19. Both tax incentives and direct federal funding represent federal expenses. In terms of the budget, tax incentives generate tax expenditures and government revenue losses because of tax exclusions or deductions. For estimates of tax expenditures arising from the R&E tax credit, see OMB (2007).\n20. The federal credit was not in place for activities conducted from July 1995 to June 1996.\n21. For tax purposes, R&D expenses are restricted to the somewhat narrower concept of R&E expenditures (Internal Revenue Code Section 174; see also NSF/SRS [2006b]). Such expenditures are limited to experimental or laboratory costs aimed at the development or improvement of a product in connection with the taxpayer's business. Furthermore, the R&E tax-credit applies to a subset of R&E expenses based on additional statutory requirements (Internal Revenue Code Section 41).\n22. The credit was not taxable from 1981 to 1988; 50% taxable in 1989; and fully taxable since 1990.\n23. Not all R&E claims are allowed. For example, there are limitations on the reduction of total tax liabilities. Data exclude IRS tax forms 1120S (S corporations), 1120-REIT (real estate investment trusts), and 1120-RIC (regulated investment companies).\n\n\f4-64 \n\nChapter 4. Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\n24. For more information about the 2003 research credit, see tables in IRS (2007). These tables have additional details based on IRS tax form 4765. The return counts obtained from SOI and used in the text represent returns claiming \"current year credit for increasing research\" (i.e., the number of returns with a non-zero amount in line 41 of IRS tax form 4765).\n25. Differences in the structure of tax credits are important in determining effective rates (compared with statutory rates).\n26. For other S&T indicators on Asian countries relative to the United States and the EU, see NSF/SRS (2007a).\n27. For discussions of R&D diversity measurement, see Archibugi and Pianta (1992). Also see Archibugi and Pianta (1996).\n28. Since the mid-1980s, EC funding of R&D has become increasingly concentrated in its multinational Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development (RTD), which were intended to strengthen the scientific and technological bases of community industry and to encourage it to become internationally competitive. EC funds distributed to member countries' firms and universities have grown considerably. The EC budget for RTD activities has grown steadily from 3.7 billion European Currency Units (ECU) in the first Framework Programme (1984\u00ad87) to 17.5 billion ECU for the Sixth Framework Programme (2003\u00ad06). The institutional recipients of these funds tend to report the source as \"foreign\" or \"funds from abroad.\" Eurostat (2001).\n29. For these data, the United States includes the 50 states; Washington, DC; Puerto Rico; and all U.S. territories and possessions.\n30. For 1999 and 2004 data on U.S. MNCs R&D employment, see BEA (2007b); for 1994 and 1999 comparisons, see NSF (2004a).\n31. BEA defines a parent company of a U.S. MNC as an entity (individual, branch, partnership, or corporation), resident in the United States, that owns or controls at least 10% of the voting securities, or equivalent, of a foreign business enterprise. For selected NSF data on overseas R&D funded by companies with R&D activities in the 50 U.S. states and Washington, DC, see appendix tables 4-48 and 4-49.\n32. For example, see Arora, Fosfuri, and Gambardella (2001); Bozeman (2000); and Chesbrough, Vanhaverbeke, and West (2006).\n33. Data are for R&D contract expenditures paid by U.S. industrial R&D performers (using company and other nonfederal R&D funds) to other domestic performers. In this section, contract R&D refers to a transaction with external parties involving R&D payments or income, regardless of its legal form. Transactions by companies that do not perform internal R&D in the United States are excluded, as are R&D activities contracted out to companies located overseas.\n34. Approximately 3% of expenditures involved universities and colleges, and 44% involved \"other R&D performers.\"\n35. Offshoring refers to the sourcing of production inputs through companies located overseas. Offshoring may\n\nbe done internally through controlled subsidiaries or affiliates, which involves FDI and related transactions (e.g., affiliated trade), or through external providers. The latter is part of outsourcing activities that in general involve either domestic or overseas external suppliers.\n36. Revenue data include operating surplus and other generally acceptable charges for services rendered. For SAS methodology and sample forms, see Census Bureau (2007).\n37. Note that except for small companies with a single physical location, company-based and establishment-based industry data are not comparable, even when they refer to the same metric. Furthermore, NSF data for companies classified in NAICS 5417 refer to R&D expenditures, whereas SAS data covered in this section refer to total exports by establishments classified in NAICS 5417. SAS data for establishments classified in professional, scientific, and technical services (NAICS 54) are available since 1998. SAS data for R&D services (NAICS 5417) is available for R&D in the physical, engineering, and life sciences (54171) and social sciences and humanities (54172). Data used in this section are limited to the former. For case studies in services industries, including the scientific R&D services industry, see Gallaher and Petrusa (2006).\n38. The category of RDT services is part of business, professional, and technical services (or business services, for short). The latter include royalties and license fees, discussed in chapter 6.\n39. Technology alliances may or may not be part of larger agreements involving manufacturing, licensing, or other forms of business collaboration. For recent studies on the role of technology licensing (e.g., technology development, commercialization strategy), see Fosfuri (2006) and Hagedoorn, Lorenz-Orlean, and Kranenburg (2007).\n40. As amended by the National Cooperative Research and Production Act of 1993 (Public Law 103\u00ad42). See U.S.C. Title 15, Chapter 69. More recently, federal patent and trademark law was amended in order to facilitate patenting inventions resulting from collaborative efforts across different companies or organizations. The amendment was instituted by the Cooperative Research and Technology Enhancement (CREATE) Act of 2004 (Public Law 108\u00ad453) and applies to patents resulting from joint research as long as the claimed invention is within the scope of a written contract, grant, or cooperative agreement and made by or on behalf of the parties to the agreement.\n41. CATI-MERIT is a literature-based database that draws on sources such as newspapers, journal articles, books, and specialized journals that report on business events. It includes business alliances with an R&D or technology component, such as joint research or development agreements, R&D contracts, and equity joint ventures. Agreements involving small firms and certain technology fields are likely to be underrepresented. Another limitation is that the database draws primarily from English-language materials. No data on alliance duration or termination date are available.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 4-65\n\n42. Federal laboratories are facilities owned, leased, or otherwise used by a federal agency, according to 15 U.S.C. 3710a(d)(2). They include, for example, intramural laboratories (e.g., the laboratories owned by NIH's National Cancer Institute) and government-owned, contractor-operated laboratories such as some of DOE's FFRDCs. See also the section entitled \"Federal R&D.\"\n43. For additional metrics and agencies up to FY 2003, see chapter 4 in NSB (2006), based on data from DOC, Office of the Secretary, Summary Report on Federal Laboratory Technology Transfer: FY 2003 Activity Metrics and Outcomes, 2004 Report to the President and the Congress Under the Technology Transfer and Commercialization Act (2004). An updated report was not available at the time of writing.\n44. For studies on patents, citations, and other technology transfer metrics at NASA and DOE, see chapters 9 and 10, respectively, in Jaffe and Trajtenberg (2001). For technology transfer activities and case studies involving USDA R&D, see Heisey et al. (2006).\n45. SBIR was created by the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982 (Public Law 97\u00ad219, U.S.C. Title 15, Section 631). It was last reauthorized in 2000 through September 2008. The 2000 reauthorization bill (Public Law 106\u00ad554) also requested that the National Research Council conduct a multiyear SBIR study at five federal agencies with SBIR budgets exceeding $50 million (DOD, HHS, NASA, DOE, and NSF). The study is in progress. See NRC (2007) and National Academies (2007).\n46. STTR was created by the Small Business Technology Transfer Act of 1992 (Title II of the Small Business Research and Development Enhancement Act, Public Law 102\u00ad564). It was last reauthorized by the Small Business Technology Transfer Program Reauthorization Act of 2001 (Public Law 107\u00ad50) through FY 2009.\n47. Title I of the Small Business Research and Development Enhancement Act, Public Law 102\u00ad564.\n48. To obtain this federal funding, a small company applies for a Phase I SBIR grant of up to $100,000 for up to 6 months to assess the scientific and technical feasibility of ideas with commercial potential. If the concept shows further potential, the company can receive a Phase II grant of up to $750,000 over a period of up to 2 years for further development. In Phase III, the innovation must be brought to market with private-sector investment and support; no SBIR funds may be used for Phase III activities.\n49. STTR is also structured in three phases. 50. Public Law 100\u00ad418; 15 U.S.C. Section 278n. 51.

Research and Development: National Trends and International Linkages\n\nGeneral university fund (GUF): Block grants provided by all levels of government in Europe, Canada, and Japan to the academic sector that can be used to support departmental R&D programs that are not separately budgeted; the U.S. federal government does not provide research support through a GUF equivalent.\nGross domestic product (GDP): Market value of goods and services produced within a country.\nIntellectual property: Intangible property that is the result of creativity; the most common forms of intellectual property include patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets.\nMajority-owned affiliate: Company owned or controlled by more than 50% of the voting securities (or equivalent) by its parent company.\nMultinational corporation (MNC): A parent company and its foreign affiliates.\nNational income and product accounts: Economic accounts that display the value and composition of national output and the distribution of incomes generated in its production.\nPublic-private partnership: Collaboration between private or commercial organizations and at least one public or nonprofit organization such as a university, research institute, or government laboratory. Examples include cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs), industry-university alliances, and science parks.\nR&D: Research and development, also called research and experimental development, comprises creative work undertaken on a systematic basis to increase the stock of knowledge--including knowledge of man, culture, and society--and its use to devise new applications.\nR&D employees: Scientists and engineers who perform R&D functions.\nR&D intensity: Measure of R&D expenditures relative to size, production, or other characteristic of a country or R&D-performing sector. Examples include companyfunded R&D to net sales ratio, R&D to GDP ratio, and R&D per employee.\nR&D plant expenditures: Acquisition of, construction of, major repairs to, or alterations in structures, works, equipment, facilities, or land for use in R&D activities.\nTechnology alliance: Type of industrial technology linkage aimed at codevelopment of new products or capabilities through R&D collaboration.\nTechnology transfer: Exchange or sharing of knowledge, skills, processes, or technologies across different organizations.\nU.S. affiliate: Company located in the United States but owned by a foreign parent.\nValue-added: Sales minus the cost of materials.\n\nReferences\nAmerican Chemical Society. 2006.

Since 2000, average annual growth in R&D was stronger for the academic sector than for any other R&D-performing sector.\n Academic R&D reached about 0.4% of the gross domestic product in 2006.\n Academic performers are estimated to account for 56% of U.S. basic research ($61 billion), about 33% of total (basic plus applied) research ($140 billion), and 14% of all R&D ($340 billion) estimated to have been conducted in the United States in 2006.\nAll reported sources of support for academic R&D (federal, industrial, state and local, and institutional) increased fairly continuously in absolute dollar terms between 1972 and 2000, even after adjusting for inflation. Beginning in 2001, funding from industry declined for 3 straight years but then rebounded between 2004 and 2006. Support from the federal government decreased in 2006 as funding growth failed to outpace inflation for the first time since 1982.\n The federal government provided 63% of funding for academic R&D expenditures in 2006, representing substantial growth from the 58% share of support provided in 2000 but less than the 68% share supplied in 1972.\n Institutions themselves contributed 19% of funds in 2006, compared with 12% in 1972.\n Industry's share of academic R&D support grew rapidly during the 1970s and 1980s, fluctuated around 7% of the total during the 1990s, and declined thereafter to 5% in 2003 as a result of absolute constant dollar declines in 2002 and 2003. Despite the recent increase in absolute dollars between 2004 and 2006, industry's share remained at 5% in 2006.\nBetween 1996 and 2006, the distribution of academic R&D funds received by different S&E fields remained relatively constant, with the largest shift in the field of life sciences.\n Only the life sciences and psychology (up 5.2 and 0.2 percentage points, respectively) saw their share of the academic R&D total increase between 1996 and 2006.\n The share held by engineering decreased by 1.3 percentage points between 1996 and 2006 after having gained almost 5 percentage points overall between 1975 and 1996.\n The fields of environmental sciences, mathematics, physical sciences, and social sciences experienced modest share declines between 1996 and 2006 (1.0, 0.1, 1.8, and 1.2 percentage points, respectively).\n\n The social sciences experienced the largest decrease in share over the past three decades, dropping by more than half from 7.5% in 1975 to 3.6% in 2006.\nThe share of all academic R&D funded by the federal government varies significantly by field, and the fields of life sciences and psychology have seen the largest increases in their federal share in recent years.\n The fields with the largest share of federally funded R&D in 2006 were the atmospheric sciences (80%), physics (75%), aeronautical/astronautical engineering (74%), and psychology (72%).\n Economics (35%), political science (34%), and the agricultural sciences (32%) had the smallest shares of federal funding in 2006.\n Between 1998 and 2004, the period in which federal policies doubled the R&D budget of the National Institutes of Health, the share of federally financed R&D funding for the life sciences increased rapidly, from 57% to 64%, and the share in psychology increased from 67% to 75%.\nThe historical concentration of academic R&D funds among the top research universities has remained relatively steady over the past 20 years.\n In terms of total R&D funding, the share of all academic R&D expenditures received by the top 100 academic institutions decreased from 83% to 80% between 1986 and 1993 and has remained at that level through 2006.\n Only 5 of the top 20 institutions in 1986 were not in the top 20 in 2006.\nIn 2006, although about $1.8 billion in current funds was spent on R&D equipment, the share of all annual R&D expenditures spent on research equipment continued a two-decade decline.\n After reaching a high of 7% in 1985 and 1986, the share of R&D spent on equipment declined to 4% in 2006.\n About 83% of equipment expenditures were concentrated in the life sciences (41%), engineering (24%), and the physical sciences (18%).\n After more than doubling in constant 2000 dollars between 1985 and 2004, the life sciences subfields of medical and biological sciences experienced declines in equipment expenditures in 2005 and 2006. Engineering equipment expenditures also doubled between 1985 and 2005 but declined in 2006.\nResearch-performing colleges and universities continued to expand their stock of research space in FY 2005, but at a significantly slower rate than in the previous 2-year period. In addition to the traditional \"bricks and mortar\" research infrastructure, \"cyberinfrastructure\" may be playing an increasingly important role in the conduct of S&E research.\n\n\f5-6 \n\nChapter 5. Academic Research and Development\n\n In FY 2004\u00ad05, all S&E fields except for the earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences experienced increases in research space.\n Based on current construction of new space and plans for new construction, the biological and medical sciences will continue to dominate the share of total research space and funds for new construction.\n In FY 2005, 21% of academic institutions reported bandwidth of 1 gigabit or faster, and this percentage is estimated to increase to 30% in FY 2006.\nDoctoral Scientists and Engineers in Academia\nThe size of the doctoral academic S&E workforce reached an estimated 274,200 in 2006 but grew more slowly than the number of S&E doctorate holders in other employment sectors. Full-time tenure-track faculty positions, although still the predominant employment mode, increased more slowly than postdoc and other full- and part-time positions, especially at research universities.\n The academic share of all doctoral S&E employment dropped from 55% in 1973 to 45% in 2006.\n The share of full-time faculty declined from 88% in the early 1970s to 72% in 2006. Other full-time positions rose to 14% of the total, and postdoc and part-time appointments stood at 9% and 6%, respectively.\nThe demographic composition of the academic doctoral labor force changed substantially between 1973 and 2006.\n The number of women in academia increased more than eightfold, from 10,700 to about 90,700, raising their share from 9% to 33%.\n The number of underrepresented minorities (blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians/Alaska Natives) rose about ninefold, from 2,400 to 22,400, but remain a small percentage (8%) of the S&E doctorate holders in academia.\n The number of Asians/Pacific Islanders entering the academic S&E doctoral workforce, many of them foreign born, increased substantially, from 5,000 to about 38,800, raising their share from 4% to 14%.\n The share of whites in the academic S&E doctoral workforce fell during the period from 91% to 78%; the white male share fell from about 83% to about 52%.\nForeign-born scientists and engineers are an increasing share of doctoral S&E faculty.\n Foreign-born scientists and engineers were 28% of all full-time doctoral S&E faculty in 2003, up from 21% in 1992.\n In the physical sciences, mathematics, computer sciences, and engineering, 47% of full-time doctoral S&E faculty in research institutions were foreign born, up from 38% in 1992.\n\nThe average age of the academic doctoral labor force has been rising during the past quarter century.\n Both the mean age (42\u00ad48) and median age (40\u00ad48) increased almost monotonically between 1973 and 2006.\n In 2006, a growing, albeit small, fraction of employment (6%) was made up of individuals age 65 or older.\n Retirement rates remained relatively stable from 1993 to 2003.\nA substantial academic researcher pool has developed outside the regular faculty ranks.\n Postdocs and others in full-time nonfaculty positions constitute an increasing percentage of those doing research at academic institutions, having grown from 13% in 1973 to 27% in 2006. This change was especially pronounced in the 1990s.\n The share of full-time doctoral S&E instructional faculty who are engaged primarily in research increased from 20% to 26% between 1992 and 2003.\nIn most fields, the percentage of academic researchers with federal support for their work was about the same in 2006 as it was in the late 1980s.\n Among all academic S&E doctorate holders employed in academia, 47% received federal support in 2006, compared with 48% in 1989.\n Among life scientists, the percentage of academic S&E doctorate holders with federal support dropped from 65% in 1989 to 58% in 2006, although the actual number reporting federal support increased during the period.\n Full-time doctoral S&E faculty in the academic workforce were less likely to receive federal support (46%) than postdocs (71%).\n Among full-time faculty, recent doctorate recipients were less likely to receive federal support than their more established colleagues.\nOutputs of S&E Research: Articles and Patents\nS&E article output worldwide grew at an average annual rate of 2.3% between 1995 and 2005, but the U.S. growth rate was much lower.\n U.S. output grew 0.6% annually over the same period, compared with 1.8% for the European Union and 6.6% for a group of 10 Asian countries/economies (Asia-10), including China at 17% and South Korea at 16%.\n The U.S. share of total world article output fell between 1995 and 2005, from 34% to 29%, as did the European Union share, which declined from 35% to 33%, whereas the Asia-10 share increased from 13% to 20%.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 5-7\n\nOn a national basis, the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Germany dominated total S&E article output in both 1995 and 2005.\n China advanced from 14th to 5th place overall, to 2nd place in engineering and chemistry, and to 3rd place in physics and mathematics.\n South Korea, Brazil, and Turkey, not among the top 20 national producers in 1995, held 10th, 17th, and 19th place, respectively, in 2005.\nS&E research is an increasingly collaborative activity. Between 1988 and 2005, the share of publications with authors from multiple institutions grew from 40% to 61%.\n Coauthored articles with only domestic institutions in the bylines grew from 32% to 41% of all articles.\n Articles with institutions from multiple countries--an indicator of international collaboration and the globalization of science--grew from 8% to 20%.\nThe United States has the largest share of all internationally authored articles, and U.S. researchers collaborate most often with counterparts in Germany, the United Kingdom, and Canada.\n However, when U.S. international collaboration is normalized for the volume of its partner's international coauthorship, only collaboration between the United States and Canada, Israel, South Korea, and Taiwan is more frequent than would be predicted.\n Higher rates of research collaboration are to be found, for example, between Argentina and Brazil, South Korea and Japan, Australia and New Zealand, and among the Scandinavian countries.\nIndicators of collaboration based on coauthorship among U.S. sectors and between U.S. sectors and foreign authors show that integration of R&D activities is occurring across the full range of R&D-performing institutions in the United States.\n U.S. cross-sectoral coauthorship between all sectors except federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) and industry increased during the 1995\u00ad2005 period. The largest gains in all sectors were with coauthors in academia: By 2005, the percentage of articles with coauthors from academia was 71% for state/local government, 62% for private nonprofit institutions, and 59% for the federal government.\n\n Between 1995 and 2005, coauthorship with foreign authors increased by 10 percentage points for authors in FFRDCs, industry, and private nonprofit institutions and by 9 percentage points for authors in the federal government and academia.\n Of the S&E fields, astronomy had the highest rate of international coauthorship in 2005, at 58%, well above the U.S. national average of 27% across all fields.\nAlthough the U.S. share of world article output and article citations has declined, the influence of U.S. research articles has increased, as indicated by the percentage of U.S. articles that are among the most highly cited worldwide.\n In 1995, authors from U.S. institutions had 73% more articles in the top 1% of cited articles in all S&E fields than would be expected based on U.S. total article output; in 2005, the percentage had grown to 83%.\n In 2005, the European Union had 16% fewer articles in the top 1% of cited articles than would be expected, and the Asia-10 had 59% fewer than would be expected. However, both the European Union and Asia-10 have advanced on this indicator since 1995.\nIndicators of academic patenting are mixed. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) reports that patent grants to universities have declined since 2002, but other indicators suggest continued expansion of activities related to patents and patent/licensing revenues.\n According to USPTO, patent grants to universities and colleges increased sharply from 1995 to about 2002, when they peaked at just under 3,300 patents per year, and then fell to about 2,700 in 2005. Three biomedically related patent classes continued to dominate these awards, accounting for more than one-third in 2005.\n Other data indicate, however, that invention disclosures filed with university technology management offices grew from 13,700 in 2003 to 15,400 in 2005 and that patent applications filed by reporting universities and colleges increased from 7,200 in 2003 to 9,500 in 2004 and 9,300 in 2005.\n University inventories of revenue-generating licenses and options also continued to grow, as did the annual number of new licenses and options executed. The annual number of startup companies established as a result of universitybased inventions rebounded after 2 years of downturns in 2002 and 2003 to more than 400 in both 2004 and 2005.\n\n\f5-8 \n\nChapter 5. Academic Research and Development\n\nIntroduction\nChapter Overview\nU.S. universities and colleges are key contributors to the nation's S&E enterprise. The academic sector develops scientists and engineers through its education and training activities (see chapter 2, \"Higher Education in Science and Engineering\") and generates new knowledge and ideas through its research activities. Almost 60% of the nation's basic research and about a third of its total research are carried out in academic institutions. The federal government has been and continues to be the major financial supporter of academic R&D, providing almost two-thirds of the funding in 2005. Other major funding sources are the institutions themselves, industry, and state and local government.\nThe allocation of the national academic R&D investment has been changing over time, with the share going to the life sciences growing substantially over the past several decades. This has prompted serious discussion about the appropriate distribution of funds across disciplines. The President's FY 2008 R&D budget signals a goal to double federal funds for agencies supporting physical sciences and engineering research over the coming decade.\nDoctoral S&E faculty in universities and colleges play a critical role in performing research and in ensuring a welltrained, diverse supply of S&E personnel for all sectors of the economy. Hiring of S&E doctorate holders into academic positions over the past decade suggests a relative decline in reliance on full-time tenure-track faculty positions in favor of other forms of employment. This shift is expected to continue as academia approaches a period of potentially increasing retirements because of its aging labor force. The demographic composition of new hires is likely to continue the trend toward more women and minorities that mirrors similar changes in the student population. Trends in foreignborn faculty and foreign graduate students, stabilizing after the events of September 11, 2001, remain uncertain because of the rapid development of higher education and research capacities in many countries and the growing international competition for highly skilled talent. All these changes will affect the composition and teaching and research roles of the future doctoral S&E faculty.\nA measure of research output, the number of U.S. S&E articles published in the world's leading S&E journals, recently began to increase after remaining flat for almost a decade. During that time, the number of articles by scientists in the European Union (EU) and several Asian countries grew strongly. As a result of these combined trends, the U.S. share of the world's S&E article output has declined since the early 1970s. The number of influential articles from U.S. institutions, as measured by citation frequency, remained fairly flat, and as a result, the U.S. share of the world's influential articles also declined. However, U.S. scientific publications remain influential relative to those of other countries.\n\nArticle output by the academic sector, which publishes most U.S. research articles, mirrored the overall U.S. trend, even though research inputs (specifically, academic R&D expenditures and research personnel) continued to increase. Both domestic and international collaboration have increased significantly over the past two decades as academic scientists and engineers collaborated extensively with colleagues in other U.S. sectors (federal and state government, industry, nonprofit institutions, and federally funded research and development centers) and abroad. The results of academic S&E research increasingly extend beyond articles to patents, which are an indicator of academic institutions' efforts to protect the intellectual property derived from their inventions, technology transfer, and university-industry collaboration, and other related activities such as revenue-generating licenses and formation of startup companies.\nTo help provide a context for discussions about the organization, focus, and mission of U.S. universities and colleges, this chapter addresses key aspects of the academic R&D enterprise, including the level, field allocation, and institutional distribution of academic R&D funds; the state of research equipment and facilities at academic institutions; trends in the number and composition of the academic S&E doctoral labor force; and indicators of research outputs.\nChapter Organization\nThe first section of this chapter discusses the role of academia within the national R&D enterprise. This discussion is followed by an examination of trends in the financial resources provided for academic R&D, including identification of key funders and allocations of funds across both academic institutions and S&E fields. Because the federal government has been the primary source of support for academic R&D for more than half a century, the importance of selected agencies to both overall support and support for individual fields is explored in some detail. This section also presents data on changes in the distribution of funds among academic institutions and on the number of academic institutions that receive federal R&D support. It concludes with an examination of the status of two key elements of university research activities: equipment and infrastructure, including cyberinfrastructure.\nThe next section discusses trends in employment of academic doctoral scientists and engineers with special reference to research. Major trends examined include numbers of academic doctoral scientists and engineers, the types of institutions in which they are employed, the types of positions they hold, their research activities, and federal support for research. Differences between S&E faculty and non-S&E faculty and between doctoral and nondoctoral S&E faculty are taken into account. The section also examines shifts in faculty age structure, trends in retirement patterns, and demographic characteristics, including characteristics and employment patterns of recent doctorate holders entering academic positions and participation of women and minorities.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 5-9\n\nThe chapter concludes with an analysis of trends in two types of research outputs: S&E articles, as measured by data from a set of journals covered by the Science Citation Index (SCI) and the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), and patents issued to U.S. universities. (A third major output of academic R&D, educated and trained personnel, is discussed in this chapter and chapter 2.) This section looks specifically at the volume of research (article counts), collaboration in the conduct of research (joint authorship), and use in subsequent scientific activity (citation patterns). It concludes with a discussion of academic patenting and some returns to academic institutions from their patents and licenses.\nFinancial Resources for Academic R&D\nAcademic R&D is a significant part of the national R&D enterprise.1 To carry out world-class research and advance the scientific knowledge base, U.S. academic researchers require financial resources, stability of research support, and research facilities and instrumentation that facilitate highquality work. Several funding indicators bear on the state of academic R&D, including:\n The level and stability of overall funding\n The sources of funding and changes in their relative shares\n The distribution of funding among the different R&D activities (basic research, applied research, and development)\n The distribution of funding among S&E broad and detailed fields\n The distribution of funding across institutions that perform academic R&D and the extent of their participation\n The role of the federal government as a supporter of academic R&D and the particular roles of the major federal agencies funding this sector\n The state of the physical infrastructure (research equipment and facilities)\nIndividually and in combination, these factors influence the evolution of the academic R&D enterprise and, therefore, are the focus of this section. The main findings are as follows:\n Growth in federal funding of academic R&D has slowed.\n Continued but differential increases in funding for all fields resulted in a relative shift in the distribution of funds, with increasing shares for the life sciences, engineering, and the computer sciences.\n The field of medical sciences experienced the largest increase in the past several decades, its share having risen by 10 percentage points since 1975.\n R&D activity expanded to a wider set of institutions, but the concentration of funds among the top research universities remained relatively constant over the past two decades.\n\n The share of all annual R&D expenditures spent on research equipment reached a historic low.\n Growth in academic S&E research space continued, particularly in the medical and biological sciences.\nFor a discussion of the nature of the data used in this section, see sidebar, \"Data Sources for Financial Resources for Academic R&D.\"\nAcademic R&D Within the National R&D Enterprise\nAcademia plays an important role in the nation's overall R&D effort, especially by contributing to the generation of new knowledge through basic research. Since 1998, academia has accounted for more than half of the basic research performed in the United States.\nIn 2006, U.S. academic institutions spent $48 billion, or $41 billion in constant 2000 dollars, on R&D.2 Academia's role as an R&D performer increased during the past three decades, rising from about 10% of all R&D performed in the United States in the early 1970s to an estimated 14% in 2006 (figure 5-1). For a comparison with other countries, see \"International R&D Comparisons\" in chapter 4.\nCharacter of Work Academic R&D activities are concentrated at the research\n(basic and applied) end of the R&D spectrum and do not include much development activity.3 For the definitions used in National Science Foundation (NSF) surveys and a fuller discussion of these concepts, see chapter 4 sidebar, \"Definitions of R&D.\" In 2006, an estimated 96% of academic R&D expenditures went for research (75% for basic and 22% for applied) and 4% for development (figure 5-2; appendix table 5-1). From the perspective of national research (basic and applied), as opposed to national R&D, academic institutions accounted for an estimated 33% of the U.S. total in 2006. In terms of basic research alone, the academic sector is the country's largest performer, currently accounting for an estimated 56% of the national total. Between the early 1970s and early 1980s, the academic sector's basic research share declined from slightly more to slightly less than onehalf of the national total (figure 5-1). In the early 1990s, its share of the national total began to increase once again.\nGrowth Between 1970 and 2006, the average annual R&D growth\nrate (in constant 2000 dollars) of the academic sector (4.3%) was higher than that of any other R&D-performing sector except the nonprofit one (4.6%). (See figure 5-3 and appendix table 4-4 for time-series data by R&D-performing sector.) Since 2000, the academic sector has grown faster than any U.S. R&D-performing sector (4.6%). As a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP), academic R&D rose from 0.24% in 1970 to 0.35% in 2006, almost a 50% increase. (See appendix table 4-1 for GDP time series.)\n\n\f5-10 \n\nChapter 5. Academic Research and Development\n\nData Sources for Financial Resources for Academic R&D\n\nThe data used to describe financial and infrastructure resources for academic R&D are derived from four National Science Foundation (NSF) surveys. These surveys use similar but not always identical definitions, and the nature of the respondents also differs across the surveys. The four main surveys are as follows:\n Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development\n Survey of Federal Science and Engineering Support to Universities, Colleges, and Nonprofit Institutions\n Survey of Research and Development Expenditures at Universities and Colleges\n Survey of Science and Engineering Research Facilities\nThe first two surveys collect data from federal agencies, whereas the last two collect data from universities and colleges. (For descriptions of the methodologies of the NSF surveys, see NSF/SRS 1995a, b and the Division of Science Resources Statistics website, http://www.nsf. gov/statistics/.)\nData presented in the context section, \"Academic R&D Within the National R&D Enterprise,\" are derived from special tabulations that aggregate NSF survey data on the various sectors of the U.S. economy so that the components of the overall R&D effort are placed in a national context. These data are reported on a calendar-year basis, and the data for 2005 and 2006 are preliminary. Since 1998, these data also attempt to eliminate double counting in the academic sector by subtracting current fund expenditures for separately budgeted S&E R&D that do not remain in the institution reporting them but are passed through to other institutions via subcontracts and similar collaborative research arrangements. Data in subsequent sections are reported on a fiscal-year basis and do not net out the funds passed through to other institutions, and therefore differ from those reported in this section. Data on major funding sources, funding by institution type, distribution of R&D funds across academic institutions, and expenditures by field and funding source are from the Survey of Research and Development Expenditures at Universities and Colleges. For various methodological reasons, parallel data by field from the NSF Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development do not necessarily match these numbers.\nThe data in the \"Federal Support of Academic R&D\" section come primarily from NSF's Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development. This survey collects data on R&D obligations from 30 federal agencies. Data for FY 2006 and FY 2007 are preliminary estimates.\n\nThe amounts reported for FY 2006 and FY 2007 are based on administration budget proposals and do not necessarily represent actual appropriations. Data on federal obligations by S&E field are available only through FY 2005. They refer only to research (basic and applied) rather than to research plus development.\nThe data in the section \"Spreading Institutional Base of Federally Funded Academic R&D\" are drawn from NSF's Survey of Federal Science and Engineering Support to Universities, Colleges, and Nonprofit Institutions. This survey collects data on federal R&D obligations to individual U.S. universities and colleges from the approximately 18 federal agencies that account for virtually all such obligations. For various methodological reasons, data reported in this survey do not necessarily match those reported in the Survey of Research and Development Expenditures at Universities and Colleges.\nData on research equipment are taken from the Survey of Research and Development Expenditures at Universities and Colleges. Data on research facilities and cyberinfrastructure are taken from the Survey of Science and Engineering Research Facilities. These two surveys do not cover the same populations. The minimum threshold for inclusion in the expenditures survey is $150,000 in expenditures, whereas the minimum threshold for inclusion in the facilities survey is $1 million. The facilities survey was redesigned for FY 2003 implementation and its topics broadened to include computing and networking capacity as well as research facilities. Data reported on various characteristics of research space are imputed for item nonresponse and weighted to national estimates for unit nonresponse. The data reported on networking and information technology planning are not imputed or weighted. Although terms are defined specifically in each survey, in general, facilities expenditures are classified as capital funds, are fixed items such as buildings, often cost millions of dollars, and are not included within R&D expenditures as reported here. Research equipment and instruments (the terms are used interchangeably in this chapter) are purchased with current funds (those in the yearly operating budget for ongoing activities) and included within R&D expenditures. Because donated research equipment is not typically captured in university accounting systems, the value of donated research equipment is not reported. Because the categories are not mutually exclusive, some large instrument systems could be classified as either facilities or equipment. Generally, academic institutions keep separate accounts for current and capital funds.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 5-11\n\nFigure 5-1 Academic R&D, basic and applied research, and basic research as share of total of each category: 1970\u00ad2006\nPercent 80\n60 Basic research\n40\nBasic and applied research\n20 R&D\n0 1970 1974 1978 1982 1986 1990 1994 1998 2002 2006\nNOTES: Preliminary data for 2005 and 2006.

Also see appendix tables 4-3, 4-7, 4-11, and 4-15 for data underlying percentages.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\nMajor Funding Sources\nThe academic sector relies on a variety of funding sources for support of its R&D activities, although the federal government has consistently contributed the majority of the funds (figure 5-4). In 2006, the federal government accounted for about 63% of the funding of the $48 billion of R&D performed in academic institutions (figure 5-5; appendix table 5-2). This share represents a slight decline after an increase from 58% to 64% between 2000 and 2004. In 2006, federal funding failed to outpace inflation for the first time since 1982.\nFederal support of academic R&D is discussed in detail later in this section. The following list summarizes the contributions of other sectors to academic R&D:4  Institutional funds. In 2006, institutional funds from\nuniversities and colleges constituted the second largest source of funding for academic R&D, accounting for 19% ($9.1 billion), slightly below a peak of 20% in 2001 (appendix table 5-2). Institutional funds encompass two categories: (1) institutionally financed organized research expenditures and (2) unreimbursed indirect costs and related sponsored research. They do not include departmental research and thus exclude funds (notably for faculty salaries) in cases in which research activities are not separately budgeted.\n\nFigure 5-2 Academic R&D expenditures, by character of work, and national R&D expenditures, by performer and character of work: 2006\n\nPercent\n\n100\n\nDevelopment\n\nApplied Research\n80\n\n60\nBasic Research 40\n\n20\n0 Academic R&D\n\nOther FFRDCs Industry Federal government Academia\nNational Basic R&D research\n\nApplied research\n\nFFRDC = federally funded research and development center\nNOTE: Preliminary data.\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, National Patterns of R&D Resources (annual series).

See appendix table 5-2.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nThe share of support represented by institutional funds increased steadily between 1972 (12%) and 1991 (19%) but since then has remained fairly stable at roughly onefifth of total funding. Institutional R&D funds may be derived from (1) general-purpose state or local government appropriations (particularly for public institutions) or federal appropriations; (2) general-purpose funds from\n\nindustry, foundations, or other outside sources; (3) tuition and fees; (4) endowment income; and (5) unrestricted gifts. Other potential sources of institutional funds are income from patents or licenses and income from patient care revenues. (See section \"Patent-Related Activities and Income\" later in this chapter for a discussion of patent and licensing income.)\n State and local government funds. State and local governments provided 6% ($3.0 billion) of academic R&D funding in 2006. Even though their absolute funding total continues to rise annually, the nonfederal government share has been slowly declining since its peak of 10.2% in 1972 to 1974. This share only reflects funds that state and local governments directly target to academic R&D activities.5 It does not include general-purpose state or local government appropriations that academic institutions designate and use to fund separately budgeted research or cover unreimbursed indirect costs.6 Consequently, the actual contribution of state and local governments to academic R&D is not fully captured here, particularly for public institutions. (See chapter 8, \"State Indicators,\" for some indicators of academic R&D by state.)\n Industry funds. After a 3-year decline between 2001 and 2004, industry funding of academic R&D increased for the second year in a row, to $2.4 billion in 2006. After reaching a high of 7% in 1999, industry's share has remained at 5% since 2003. Industrial support accounts for the smallest share of academic R&D funding, and support of academia has never been a major component of industry-funded R&D. (See appendix table 4-5 for timeseries data on industry-reported R&D funding.)\n Other sources of funds. In 2006, other sources of support accounted for 7% ($3.2 billion) of academic R&D funding, a level that has stayed about the same since 1972. This category of funds includes grants and contracts for R&D from nonprofit organizations and voluntary health agencies and gifts from private individuals that are restricted by the donor to the conduct of research, as well as all other sources restricted to research purposes not included in the other categories.7\nExpenditures by Field and Funding Source\nExamining and documenting academic R&D investment patterns across disciplines allows assessment of the funding balance in the academic R&D portfolio. For a discussion of non-S&E R&D expenditures see sidebar, \"Non-S&E R&D.\" In 2006, the life sciences continued to receive the largest share of investment in academic R&D, accounting for roughly 60% of all expenditures and also of federal and nonfederal expenditures (appendix table 5-3). Within the life sciences, the medical sciences accounted for 33% of all academic R&D expenditures and the biological sciences accounted for another 19%.8 The field of medical sciences has experienced the greatest increase in R&D investment over the past three decades. Between 1975 and 2006, R&D ex-\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nNon-S&E R&D\nBeginning in 2003, the Survey of Research and Development Expenditures at Universities and Colleges has reported information at the institutional level on non-S&E R&D expenditures in addition to expenditures on S&E R&D. In 2003, 82% of the survey respondents provided data on R&D expenditures by non-S&E field, reporting a total of $1.4 billion in non-S&E R&D expenditures. In 2004, a slightly higher percentage of institutions provided data (85%), and the reported amount of non-S&E R&D expenditures increased to $1.6 billion. In 2005, the percentage of institutions providing these data increased to 94% and the reported amount of non-S&E R&D expenditures increased to $1.8 billion. Finally, 96% of institutions reported non-S&E R&D expenditures in 2006 totaling $1.9 billion (table 5-1). This amount is in addition to the $48 billion expended on S&E R&D. The largest amounts reported for individual non-S&E fields were in education ($817 million), business and management ($248 million), and humanities ($214 million). More than half of the federally financed non-S&E R&D expenditures (56.2%, or $435 million) were in the field of education.\n\nTable 5-1 R&D expenditures in non-S&E fields at universities and colleges: FY 2006\n(Millions of current dollars)\n\nField\n\nAll expenditures\n\nFederal expenditures\n\nAll fields ..........................\n\n1,880\n\n773\n\nBusiness and\n\nmanagement .............\n\n248\n\n53\n\nCommunications/\n\njournalism/library\n\nscience ......................\n\n85\n\n30\n\nEducation ....................\n\n817\n\n435\n\nHumanities ..................\n\n214\n\n56\n\nLaw .............................\n\n68\n\n28\n\nSocial work .................\n\n90\n\n40\n\nVisual/\n\nperforming arts..........\n\n46\n\n4\n\nOther non-S&E\n\nfields nec...................\n\n313\n\n128\n\nnec = not elsewhere classified\n\nNOTE: Detail may not add to total because some respondents reporting non-S&E R&D expenditures did not break out total and federal funds by non-S&E fields.\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Survey of Research and Development Expenditures at Universities and Colleges, Fiscal Year 2006.\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 5-13\n\npenditures in the medical sciences grew from $2.2 billion to $13.7 billion in constant 2000 dollars (figure 5-6).\nThe distribution of academic R&D expenditures across the various broad S&E fields has remained relatively constant since 1975 (figure 5-7). The largest shifts between 1975 and 2006 were in the fields of life sciences (up 4.6 percentage points), engineering (up 3.6 percentage points), and social sciences (down 3.9 percentage points). More recently, however, between 1996 and 2006, only the life sciences and psychology (up 5.2 and 0.2 percentage points, respectively) saw their share of the academic R&D total increase.\nMore significant shifts in the relative shares of academic R&D expenditures occurred within the life sciences subfields. The medical sciences' share increased by 10 percentage points between 1975 and 2006, from 24% to 33%, and the share for agricultural sciences declined by 5 percentage points from 11% to 6% (appendix table 5-4).\nThe proportion of academic R&D expenditures funded by the federal government also varies significantly by field (appendix table 5-5). The field with the largest share of federal funding in 2006 was atmospheric sciences at 80%, followed by the fields of physics (75%), aeronautical/astronautical engineering (74%), and psychology (72%). The fields with the smallest shares of federal funding in 2006 were economics (35%), political science (34%), and agricultural sciences, which at 32% had the smallest share.\n\nFigure 5-6 Academic R&D expenditures, by field: 1975\u00ad2006\n\nConstant 2000 dollars (billions)\n\n14 Medical sciences\n\nBiological sciences\n\n12\n\nEngineering\n\nPhysical sciences\n\n10\n\nEnvironmental sciences\n\nSocial sciences\n\nComputer sciences 8\nPsychology\n\nMathematical sciences 6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0 1975 1978 1982 1986 1990 1994 1998 2002 2006\nNOTE: See appendix table 4-1 for gross domestic product implicit price deflators used to convert current dollars to constant 2000 dollars.\nSOURCES: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Academic Research and Development Expenditures: Fiscal Year 2006; and WebCASPAR database, http://webcaspar.nsf.gov.

See appendix table 5-4.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nThe federally financed proportion of R&D spending declined in all of the broad S&E fields between 1975 and 1990 (appendix table 5-5).9 However, since 1990, those declines have either stabilized or reversed, and the federal share reported in 2006 is higher than the 1990 share for all fields except mathematics, physical sciences, and sciences not elsewhere classified. Specifically, between 1998 and 2004, the period in which federal policies doubled the R&D budget of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the broad fields of life sciences and psychology experienced the largest increases in their federally financed share of spending. During that period, the federal share for the life sciences increased from 57% to 64%, and the federal share for psychology increased from 67% to 75%.\nAmong the specific agency sources discussed in the next section, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including NIH, provided the largest share of federal\n\nfunding in FY 2006 ($17 billion), primarily in support of the medical and biological sciences (table 5-2). NSF provided the second largest amount of federal funding ($3.6 billion), with most (84%) going toward R&D in engineering and in the biological, computer, environmental, and physical sciences.\nFederal Support of Academic R&D\nThe federal government continues to provide the majority of the funding for academic R&D.10 Its overall contribution is the combined result of discrete funding decisions for several key R&D-supporting agencies with differing missions. Most of the funding provided by the federal government to academia reflects decisions arrived at through a competitive peer review process. Some of the funds are from longestablished programs, such as those of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), that support academic research through formula funding rather than peer review, and other funds are the result of appropriations that Congress directs federal agencies to award to projects that involve specific institutions. Infrastructure support is often provided through user facilities in federal laboratories, such as those supported by the Department of Energy (DOE). Examining and documenting the funding patterns of the key funding agencies is important to understanding both their roles and that of the federal government overall. For a discussion of a major federal program with the objective of improving the geographical distribution of federal obligations for academic R&D, see sidebar, \"EPSCoR: The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research.\"\nTop Agency Supporters Six agencies are responsible for most of the federal obli-\ngations for academic R&D, providing an estimated 95% of the $25 billion obligated in FY 2007 (appendix table 5-6). NIH provided an estimated 63% of total federal financing of academic R&D in 2007. An additional 13% was provided by NSF; 8% by the Department of Defense (DOD); 5% by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); 3% by DOE; and 2% by the USDA.11 Federal obligations for academic research (i.e., without the development component) are concentrated similarly to those for R&D (appendix table 5-7). Some differences exist, however, because some agencies place greater emphasis on development (e.g., DOD), whereas others place greater emphasis on research (e.g., NIH).\nTotal federal obligations for academic R&D in constant 2000 dollars, as well as those for DOE, NASA, NIH, and NSF, peaked in 2004 at $22.3 billion. Between 1990 and 2004, NIH's funding of academic R&D increased most rapidly, with an estimated average annual growth rate of 6.4% per year in constant 2000 dollars, increasing its share of federal funding from 52% to 63%. NASA and NSF experienced the next highest annual rates of growth during this period: 4.5% and 4.2%, respectively. Between 2004 and 2007, total obligations in constant dollars declined by an estimated 2% per year, and the decline occurred in all six major funding agencies.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 5-15\n\nTable 5-2 Federally financed academic R&D expenditures, by source of funds and S&E field: FY 2006\n(Millions of current dollars)\n\nField\n\nAll\n\nFederal\n\nexpenditures expenditures DOD\n\nDOE\n\nHHS NASA\n\nAll other NSF USDA agencies\n\nAll fields ................................................

Several agencies concentrate their funding in one field (e.g., HHS and USDA in the life sciences and DOE in the physical sciences), whereas NSF, NASA, and DOD have more diversified funding patterns (figure 5-8; appendix table 5-8). Even though an agency may place a large share of its funds in one field, it may not be a leading contributor to that field, particularly if it does not spend much on academic research (figure 5-9).\nIn FY 2005, NSF was the lead federal funding agency for academic research in the physical sciences (36% of total funding); mathematics (50%); the computer sciences (71%); and the earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences (39%) (appendix table 5-9). DOD was the lead funding agency in engineering (30%). HHS was the lead funding agency in the life sciences (91%), psychology (99%), and the social sciences (48%). Within the S&E subfields, other agencies took the leading role: DOE in physics (49%), the USDA in the agricultural sciences (99%), and NASA in astronomy (63%), aeronautical engineering (73%), and astronautical engineering (87%).\nAn Institutional Look at Academic R&D\nThe previous sections examined R&D for the entire academic sector. This section looks at some of the differences across institution types.\n\nFunding for Public and Private Universities and Colleges\nAlthough public and private universities rely on the same major sources to fund their R&D projects, the relative importance of those sources differs substantially for these two types of institutions (figure 5-10; appendix table 5-10). In 2006, public institutions received state and local government funding for approximately 8% of their total R&D expenditures ($2.7 billion of their $32.4 billion total), whereas only 2% ($0.3 billion) of private institutions' total R&D spending ($15.4 billion) was financed by state and local government. Compared with public institutions (23%, or $7.4 billion), private academic institutions also funded a much smaller portion of their R&D from institutional sources in 2006 (11%, or $1.6 billion). However, the federal government provided 75% ($11.6 billion) of the R&D funds spent by private institutions in 2006, compared with only 57% ($18.5 billion) for public institutions. The larger amount of institutional funds used for R&D at public institutions may reflect general-purpose state and local government funds that public institutions receive and can decide to use for R&D (although data on such breakdowns are not collected).12 (For a more detailed discussion of the composition of institutional funds for public and private academic institutions, see sidebar, \"Composition of Institutional Academic R&D Funds.\")\nBoth public and private institutions received approximately 5% of their R&D support from industry in 2006. The share of total R&D expenditures funded by all other sources was also fairly comparable between public and private institutions, at 6% and 7%, respectively.\n\n\f5-16 \n\nChapter 5. Academic Research and Development\n\nEPSCoR: The Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research\n\nEPSCoR, the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, is based on the premise that universities and their S&E faculty and students are valuable resources that can potentially influence a state's development in the 21st century in much the same way that agricultural, industrial, and natural resources did in the 20th century.\nEPSCoR originated as a response to a number of stated federal objectives. Section 3(e) of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended, states that \"it shall be an objective of the Foundation to strengthen research and education in the sciences and engineering, including independent research by individuals, throughout the United States, and to avoid undue concentration of such research and education.\" Even earlier, the 1947 Steelman report, Science and Public Policy, in discussing the formation of NSF, stated \"it is clear that a portion of the funds expended by the National Science Foundation should be used to strengthen the weaker, but promising, colleges and universities, and thus to increase our total scientific potential\" (emphasis added).\nBut EPSCoR did not officially begin at NSF until 1978, when Congress authorized the agency to conduct EPSCoR in response to broad public concerns about the extent of geographical concentration of federal funding of R&D. Eligibility for EPSCoR participation was limited to those jurisdictions that have historically received lesser amounts of federal R&D funding and have demonstrated a commitment to develop their research bases and to improve the quality of S&E research conducted at their universities and colleges.\nThe success of the NSF EPSCoR programs during the 1980s subsequently prompted the creation of EPSCoR and EPSCoR-like programs in six other federal agencies: the Departments of Energy, Defense, and Agriculture; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; the National Institutes of Health; and the Environmental Protection Agency. In FY 1993, congressional direction precipitated the formation of the EPSCoR Interagency Coordinating Committee (EICC). A memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed by officials of the seven agencies with EPSCoR or EPSCoR-like programs agreeing to participate in the EICC. The major objective of the MOU focused on improving coordination among and between the federal agencies in implementing EPSCoR and\n\nEPSCoR-like programs consistent with the policies of participating agencies. The participating agencies agreed to the following objectives:\n Coordinate federal EPSCoR and EPSCoR-like programs to maximize the impact of federal support while eliminating duplication in states receiving EPSCoR support from more than one agency.\n Coordinate agency objectives with state and institutional goals, where appropriate, to obtain continued nonfederal support of science and technology (S&T) research and training.\n Coordinate the development of criteria to assess gains in academic research quality and competitiveness and in S&T human resource development.\n Furthermore, as members of the EICC, the agencies agreed to exchange information on pending legislation, agency policies, and relevant programs related to S&T research and training and, when appropriate, to provide responses on issues of common concern.\nEPSCoR seeks to increase the R&D competitiveness of an eligible state through the development and utilization of the S&T resources residing in its major research universities. It strives to achieve its objective by (1) stimulating sustainable S&T infrastructure improvements at the state and institutional levels that significantly increase the ability of EPSCoR researchers to compete for federal and private sector R&D funding, and (2) accelerating the movement of EPSCoR researchers and institutions into the mainstream of federal and private sector R&D support.\nIn FY 2006, the seven EICC agencies spent a total of $353.4 million on EPSCoR or EPSCoR-like programs, up from $79.1 million in 1996, a more than fourfold increase (table 5-3). However, the Environmental Protection Agency discontinued issuing separate EPSCoR program solicitations in FY 2006, and NASA, which has 2-year money, planned for FY 2006 awards but had not yet made its selections. Twenty-seven states, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico currently participate in the combined agency EPSCoR and EPSCoR-related programs, although not every state is included in each agency's set of EPSCoR states (table 5-4).\n(continued on next page)\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 5-17\n\nTable 5-3 EPSCoR and EPSCoR-like program budgets, by agency: FY 1996\u00ad2006\n(Millions of dollars)\n\nAgency\nAll agencies .............

See appendix table 5-8.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nDistribution of R&D Funds Across Academic Institutions\nOf the 650 institutions that reported R&D expenditures of at least $150,000 in 2006, the top 20 in terms of total R&D expenditures accounted for 30% of total academic R&D spending. The top 100 institutions accounted for 80% of all academic R&D expenditures in 2006. Appendix table 5-11 presents a detailed breakdown of the distribution among the top 100 institutions.\nThe concentration of academic R&D funds among the top 100 institutions has stayed relatively constant over the past two decades (figure 5-11). In 1986, institutions not in the top 100 accounted for 17% of the nation's total academic R&D expenditures. This percentage increased to 20% in 1993 and remained at that level through 2006. The share held by the top 10 institutions has also fluctuated narrowly (between 17% and 20%) throughout this 20-year period.\nIt should be noted that the composition of the universities in each of these groups is not the same over time; mobility occurs between groups as universities increase or decrease their R&D activities. Three of the top 10 institutions in 1986 were not in the top 10 in 2006, and 5 of the top 20 institu-\n\ntions in 1986 were not in the top 20 in 2006. The next section points to an increasing number of academic institutions receiving federal support for their R&D activities between 1972 and 2005.\nSpreading Institutional Base of Federally Funded Academic R&D\nThe number of academic institutions receiving federal support for their R&D activities increased fairly steadily between 1971 and 1994, when it reached a peak of 902 institutions. Between 1995 and 2005, the number of institutions receiving federal support fluctuated between 789 and 891 (figure 5-13).13 Both the growth through 1994 and the fluctuations since then almost exclusively affected institutions that were not classified as having very high or high research activity by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. The number of such institutions receiving federal support almost doubled between 1971 and 1994, rising from 375 to 707. It then dropped to 593 in 1999 before beginning to rise again over the past several years (appendix table 5-12). These institutions' share of federal support also increased between 1971 and 2005, from 11% to 18%.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 5-19\n\nFigure 5-9 Major agency field shares of federal academic research obligations: FY 2005\n\nDOD\n\nDOE\n\nHHS\n\nDHS\n\nNASA\n\nNSF\n\nUSDA\n\nPhysical sciences\n\nMathematics\n\nComputer sciences\nEarth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences\nLife sciences\n\nPsychology\n\nSocial sciences\n\nOther sciences\n\nEngineering\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nPercent\n\nDHS = Department of Homeland Security; DOD = Department of Defense; DOE = Department of Energy; HHS = Department of Health and Human Services; NASA = National Aeronautics and Space Administration; NSF = National Science Foundation; USDA = U.S. Department of Agriculture\nNOTE: Agencies reported represent approximately 97% of federal academic research obligations.\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Federal Funds for Research and Development: Fiscal Years 2005, 2006, and 2007 (forthcoming).

Academic Research and Development\n\nComposition of Institutional Academic R&D Funds\nIn 2006, academic institutions committed a substantial amount of their own resources to R&D: roughly $9.1 billion or 19% of all funding for academic R&D. The share of institutional support for academic R&D at public institutions (23%) was greater than that at private institutions (11%) (appendix table 5-10). One possible reason for this large difference in relative support is that public universities' and colleges' own funds may include considerable state and local funds not specifically designated for R&D but used for that purpose by the institutions. Throughout the 1980s and most of the 1990s, institutional R&D funds were divided roughly equally between two components: (1) institutionally financed organized research expenditures and (2) unreimbursed indirect costs and related sponsored research. The balance shifted toward the former after 1998 as the latter share began to decline for both types of institutions. Institutional funds at public and private universities and colleges differ not only in their importance to the institution but also in their composition. Since 1980, from 53% to 69% of private institutions' own R&D funds were designated for unreimbursed indirect costs plus cost sharing, compared with 42% to 49% of public institutions' own funds (figure 5-12).\nFigure 5-12 Components of institutional R&D expenditures for public and private academic institutions: 1980\u00ad2006\nPercent 100\nUnreimbursed indirect costs and related sponsored research: private 80 Institutionally financed organized research expenditures: public\n60\n\n40\n\nUnreimbursed indirect costs and related sponsored research: public 20 Institutionally financed organized research\nexpenditures: private\n\n0 1980\n\n1985 1988 1991 1994 1997 2000 2003 2006\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Survey of Research and Development Expenditures at Universities and Colleges, special tabulations (2007).\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nFigure 5-13 Academic institutions receiving federal R&D support, by selected Carnegie classification: 1971\u00ad2005\nNumber\n1,000\n\n800\n\nAll academic institutions\n\n600 Other institutions\n400\n\n200 Doctorate-granting very high or high research activity institutions\n0 1971 1974 1977 1981 1985 1989 1993 1997 2001 2005\nNOTE: Institutions designated by 2005 Carnegie classification code.

This section examines expenditures on research equipment, the federal role in funding these expenditures, and the relation of equipment expenditures to overall R&D expenditures.\nExpenditures In 2006, about $1.8 billion in current funds was spent for\nacademic research equipment. About 83% of these expenditures were concentrated in three fields: the life sciences (41%), engineering (24%), and the physical sciences (18%) (appendix table 5-13). After more than doubling in constant 2000 dollars between 1985 and 2004, equipment expenditures in the life sciences subfields of medical and biological sciences declined in 2005 and 2006. Engineering equipment expenditures also doubled between 1985 and 2005 but declined in 2006 (figure 5-14).\nFederal Funding Federal funds for research equipment are generally\nreceived either as part of research grants or as separate equipment grants, depending on the funding policies of the particular federal agencies involved. The share of federal funding for research equipment varies significantly by field.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 5-21\n\nFigure 5-14 Current fund expenditures for research equipment at academic institutions, by field: 1985\u00ad2006\n\nConstant 2000 dollars (millions)\n\n500 Engineering\n\nMedical sciences\n\nPhysical sciences\n\nBiological sciences\n\n400\n\nEnvironmental sciences\n\nComputer sciences\n\nSocial sciences\n\nPsychology\n\nMathematical sciences\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0 1985 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006\nNOTE: See appendix table 4-1 for gross domestic product implicit price deflators used to convert current dollars to constant 2000 dollars.

See appendix table 5-13.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\nIn 2006, sociology received federal funding for 29% of its research equipment expenditures. In contrast, federal funding accounted for 82% of equipment expenditures in the field of astronomy (appendix table 5-14). The share of total expenditures for research equipment funded by the federal government fluctuated between 56% and 64% during the 1985\u00ad2006 period.\nR&D Equipment Intensity R&D equipment intensity is the percentage of total annu-\nal R&D expenditures from current funds devoted to research equipment. This proportion has been declining steadily since reaching a peak of 7% in 1985. By 2006, it had declined to 4% (appendix table 5-15). R&D equipment intensity in 2006 was highest in the physical sciences (9%) and certain engineering subfields (about 8% in both mechanical and metallurgical/materials engineering). The field of computer sciences experienced the most significant decline in research equipment intensity between 1985 and 2006, falling from 13% to 5%, which may reflect strong declines in equipment prices in this technology area and growth in capability of more general-purpose infrastructure.14\n\nAcademic R&D Infrastructure\nThe physical infrastructure of academic institutions is critical to supporting R&D activities. Traditional indicators of the status of the research infrastructure are the amount of research space currently available and the amount of investment in future facilities.\nIn addition to the traditional \"bricks and mortar\" research infrastructure, \"cyberinfrastructure\" is playing an increasingly important role in the conduct of S&E research. Technological advances are significantly changing S&E research methods. In some cases, advanced technology is already changing the role of traditional bricks and mortar facilities. According to the NSF Advisory Panel on Cyberinfrastructure, these advances are not simply changing the conduct of science but are revolutionizing it (NSF 2003). The panel defined cyberinfrastructure as the \"infrastructure based upon distributed computer, information and communication technology\" (NSF 2003, p 1.2). The report discusses the current and potential future importance of cyberinfrastructure, stating that \"digital computation, data, information and networks are now being used to replace and extend traditional efforts in science and engineering research\" (NSF 2003, p 1.1).\nHow the relationship between cyberinfrastructure and traditional bricks and mortar infrastructure will develop is unknown. For example, access to high-quality research facilities may become available to researchers located at institutions where traditional research space has not been available. Some institutions have begun conducting research not in their own laboratories or research facilities but through networking and/or high-performance computing, communicating with research facilities thousands of miles away or accessing very large databases generated by advanced data collection technologies.\nBricks and Mortar Research Space. Research-performing colleges and uni-\nversities15 continued to expand their stock of research space in FY 2005, but at a significantly slower rate than the previous 2-year period (table 5-5). Institutions reported a 7% increase in the amount of research space between FY 2003 and FY 2005, for a total of approximately 185 million net assignable square feet (NASF).16 The size of this increase was more similar to the rates of previous biennial increases than to the 11% increase between FY 2001 and FY 2003, which was the highest biennial increase since the survey began collecting data.\nIn FY 2005, research space increased in all S&E fields except the earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences, which experienced a 3% decline. Additionally, for the first time in more than a decade, the amount of research animal space declined.\nTwo of the three fields of science that experienced the largest percentage of increase in research space in FY 2003 again had the largest percentage of increase in FY 2005: the computer sciences and medical sciences. From a relatively modest base, the computer sciences had the largest increase\n\n\f5-22 \n\nChapter 5. Academic Research and Development\n\n(32%), which resulted in 4.1 million NASF. In the decade between 1996 and 2005, space for the computer sciences grew by 105%.\nDuring the same period, research space in psychology, the social sciences, mathematics, and the medical sciences also increased by more than 50%. However, except for the medical sciences, all of these fields also have the smallest amount of total space relative to the other fields. Between 1996 and 2005, the physical sciences and earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences experienced the least amount of growth in research space.\nSince survey inception, the greatest increases in research space have occurred in the biological sciences and medical sciences. The proportion of total space dedicated to these two fields has remained fairly stable from year to year, ranging between 38% and 42%. However, in 2005, the medical sciences surpassed the biological sciences in research space for the first time (39.7 million NASF versus 38.5 million NASF, respectively).\nConstruction of Research Space. Total new S&E research space being constructed in FY 2004\u00ad05 was also dominated by the biological and medical sciences. Sixtyfour percent of newly built research space and 67% of construction funds were in the biological and medical sciences (tables 5-6 and 5-7). The trend continued in FY 2006\u00ad07. Fifty-four percent of all new construction and 57% of all expenditures for this construction are planned for these two fields.17 However, whereas the largest percentage of new research space is planned for the biological and medical sciences, the physical and social sciences are expected to experience the largest rate of increase, about 200%.\n\nInstitutions anticipated a decline in the amount of newly constructed research space in the earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences in FY 2006\u00ad07. This follows an absolute decline in space in this field during the previous 2-year period. The field of earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences is the only one that experienced a decline in NASF since FY 2003\u00ad05 and the only field that anticipated a decline in new construction in FY 2006\u00ad07.\nTotal dollars invested in new construction of research space declined in FY 2005 for the first time in a decade, by 17% to $6.1 billion (table 5-7). This decline may be temporary, however, as institutions anticipate an increase in FY 2006\u00ad07 in funds expended for planned new construction. Even with the decline, however, total dollars for construction of new research space almost doubled between FY 1999 and FY 2005.\nAs a share of total expenditures for new construction, only the biological and medical sciences experienced an increase between FY 1987\u00ad88 and FY 2004\u00ad05, from 23% to 33% for the biological sciences and from 25% to 34% for the medical sciences. Psychology and mathematics remained about the same while all other fields experienced a decline. Institutions estimated that by FY 2006\u00ad07, the share of new construction for the biological sciences would decline to 29% and the share for the medical sciences to 28%. The share of total expenditures for research space in the earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences ($69 million) was estimated to decline to less than 1%. The largest percentage point increase in share of funds for new construction in FY 2006\u00ad07 was estimated for the physical sciences (from 7% to 10%).\n\nTable 5-5 S&E research space in academic institutions, by field: FY 1988\u00ad2005\n(Millions of net assignable square feet)\n\nField\nAll fields .......................................................................

Academic Research and Development\n\nSource of Funds. Institutions use one or more sources to fund their capital projects, including the federal government, state or local governments, and the institutions' own funds (appendix table 5-16).18 The federal government's share of total construction funding, never a large proportion, reached its smallest proportion (5%) of total construction funds in FY 2002\u00ad03 (figure 5-15).19 Concurrently, the institutional share of construction funds generally increased during this time and reached its highest share, 63%, in FY 2002\u00ad03.\nBetween FY 2002\u00ad03 and FY 2004\u00ad05, the federal share increased for the first time since FY 1994\u00ad95, rising from 5% to 7%. During the same period, the share of construction funds from state and local governments decreased by 9 percentage points to 23% in FY 2004\u00ad05. This was the largest percentage point decline in the state and local share since FY 1986\u00ad87, except for the 2-year period from FY 1994 to FY 1996, when the decrease was also 9 percentage points. Institutions generally accommodated this decrease in state and local funds by increasing the institutional share of funds and decreasing their total expenditures. During FY 2004\u00ad05, the institutional share rose to the highest percentage of total funds for construction (69%) since FY 1986\u00ad87. During this period, the institutional share of funds expended on repair/ renovation also increased to its highest percentage since FY 1986\u00ad87.\nCyberinfrastructure: Networking Networking resources are a key component of cyberin-\nfrastructure.20 Networks allow researchers to communicate and transfer data both within a specific institution's boundaries and with others around the world.

Although Internet connections are used for many purposes (e-mail, buying books from the campus bookstore, transfer of databases), conducting research can require greater network capabilities than other activities.\nOne common indicator of network capability is bandwidth, or speed. A network's bandwidth can affect the amount and type of research activity accomplished through the network. The greater the amount of bandwidth, the more capable the network is in handling both large amounts of data and communication traffic and more demanding or sophisticated communications. Although a slow network connection might well be able to transmit scientific articles, accessing scientific instruments and databases located thousands of miles away demands (among other requirements) higher bandwidth.\nInternet Bandwidth. In FY 2005, 43% of academic institutions reported the total of their commodity internet (Internet1) and Abilene (often called Internet2) bandwidth to be\n\nTable 5-8 Bandwidth to commodity Internet (Internet1) and Abilene (Internet2) at academic institutions: FY 2005 and 2006\n(Percent distribution)\n\nBandwidth\n\nFY 2005\n\nFY 2006\n\nAll bandwidth.....................\n\n100\n\n100\n\n<1.6 mb..........................\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1.6\u00ad9 mb ........................\n\n3\n\n2\n\n10 mb.............................\n\n1\n\n*\n\n11\u00ad45 mb .......................\n\n23\n\n18\n\n46\u00ad99 mb .......................\n\n16\n\n13\n\n100 mb...........................\n\n3\n\n4\n\n101\u00ad155 mb ...................\n\n9\n\n10\n\n156\u00ad622 mb ...................\n\n18\n\n17\n\n623\u00ad999 mb ...................\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1\u00ad2.5 gb .........................\n\n15\n\n20\n\n2.6\u00ad9 gb .........................\n\n4\n\n5\n\n10 gb..............................\n\n*\n\n1\n\n>10 gb............................\n\n2\n\n4\n\nOther ..............................\n\n*\n\n*\n\nInstitutions (number)..........\n\n449\n\n449\n\n* = >0 but <0.5% gb = gigabits/second; mb = megabits/second\n\nNOTES: Abilene is a high-performance backbone network that enables the development of advanced Internet applications and the deployment of leading-edge network services to member colleges, universities, and research laboratories across the country.

Twenty-one percent reported bandwidth of 1 gigabit or greater. The percentage of institutions with total bandwidth of 1 gigabit or faster is estimated to increase about 9 percentage points in FY 2006 to 30%.\nHigh-Performance Network Connections. In addition to their Internet1 connections, institutions may also be connected to one or more high-performance networks. By FY 2005, the majority of institutions had connected to Abilene, a high-performance network dedicated to research led by a consortium of universities, governments, and private industry; only 5% of doctorate-granting institutions did not have an Abilene connection. By FY 2006, 76% of all institutions anticipated having a connection, a 17% increase since FY 2003. Furthermore, 32% of those anticipating Abilene connections in FY 2006 also anticipated Abilene bandwidth of 1 gigabit or faster.\nInstitutions may also be connected to the National Lambda Rail, a national fiber optic infrastructure supporting multiple networks for the research community. In just 1 year, the number of institutions connected to the National Lambda Rail is expected to increase by 200%, from 10% with connections in FY 2005 to 31% in FY 2006.22 Finally, about 13% of institutions anticipated being connected to at least one federal government high-performance network, such as NASA's Research and Engineering Network (NREN) or DOE's Energy Sciences Network (ESnet), by FY 2006.\nThe majority of institutions (63%) obtained at least some of their bandwidth, whether Internet1 or high performance, through a consortium in FY 2005, and additional institutions anticipated doing so in FY 2006 (68%). All but one of the institutions reporting Internet1 connections of 1 gigabit or faster received their bandwidth through a consortium. Although institutions reported a variety of consortia, many are state and/or regional research and education networks. For example, the list of consortia includes the Metropolitan Research and Education Network (MREN), the Corporation for Education Network Initiatives in California (CENIC), Merit Network, and the New York State Education and Research Network (NYSERNet).\nInternal Institutional Networks. Concurrent with increasing connection speeds to external networks such as Internet1, institutions are also increasing their internal network speeds (table 5-9). In FY 2003, the highest speed from one desktop to another was 100 megabits at 64% of institutions and 1\u00ad2.5 gigabits at 33%. By FY 2005, only 40% of institutions reported 100 megabits as their highest desktop-to-desktop speed, and 54% reported speeds of 1 gigabit or faster. In FY 2003, no institution had a speed greater than 2.5 gigabits, whereas 4% had speeds at least this fast in FY 2005; more than 14% of institutions estimated that their highest desktopto-desktop speed would be at least this fast in FY 2006.\n\nTable 5-9 Highest desktop-to-desktop speed on an academic institution's internal network: FY 2003, 2005, and 2006\n(Percent distribution)\n\nConnection speed\n\nFY 2003 FY 2005 FY 2006\n\nAll connection speeds ...... 100\n\n100\n\n100\n\n<1.6 mb .........................\n\n*\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1.6\u00ad9 mb........................\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10 mb ............................\n\n2\n\n*\n\n0\n\n11\u00ad45 mb.......................\n\n0\n\n*\n\n*\n\n46\u00ad99 mb.......................\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1\n\n100 mb .......................... 64\n\n40\n\n28\n\n101\u00ad155 mb...................\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n156\u00ad622 mb...................\n\n*\n\n1\n\n1\n\n623\u00ad999 mb...................\n\n0\n\n3\n\n3\n\n1\u00ad2.5 gb......................... 33\n\n50\n\n53\n\n2.6\u00ad9 gb.........................\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10 gb .............................\n\n0\n\n3\n\n11\n\n>10 gb ...........................\n\n0\n\n*\n\n1\n\nOther..............................\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nInstitutions (number)......... 425\n\n449\n\n449\n\n* = >0 but <0.5%\n\ngb = gigabits/second; mb = megabits/second\n\nNOTE: Detail may not add to total because of rounding.

Doctoral scientists and engineers in academia, and in particular faculty in U.S. colleges and universities, are an important aspect of academic R&D, as they generally engage in both research and teaching. The focus of this section is on the research aspects of doctoral scientists and engineers in academia. Teaching aspects of faculty employment are more thoroughly covered in chapter 2.\nThis section examines trends in employment and research activity of doctoral scientists and engineers in U.S. universities and colleges, with special attention paid to faculty in research universities. Research universities have a disproportionate influence on the U.S. academic R&D enterprise. Research institutions, although few in number, are the leading producers of S&E bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degree recipients (see chapter 2) and the doctorate-granting source of more than three-quarters of faculty with S&E doctorates (NSF/SRS 2006). These institutions also conduct more than\n\n\f5-26 \n\nChapter 5. Academic Research and Development\n\n80% of academic R&D (as measured by expenditures) and produce the bulk of both academic articles and patents (see section \"Outputs of S&E Research: Articles and Patents\" later in this chapter).\nTrends in Academic Employment of Doctoral Scientists and Engineers\nAcademic employment of S&E doctorate holders reached a record high of 274,200 in 2006 (appendix table 5-17).23 However, long-term growth in the number of these positions between 1973 and 2006 was slower than in either business or government. Employment in the academic sector slowed in the 1990s, especially at research universities, and growth over the past three decades was slower than in the business and government sectors (table 5-10; figure 5-16). As a result, the share of all S&E doctorate holders employed in academia dropped from about 55% to 45% during the 1973\u00ad2006 period (table 5-11). Beginning in the 1990s, the share of those with recently awarded degrees (that is, a degree awarded within 3 years of the survey year) employed in academia was generally substantially higher than the overall academic employment share for S&E doctorate holders, possibly reflecting the relatively large number of young doctorate holders in postdoc positions. In 2006, more than half of recent doctorate holders were employed in academia.\nAll Academic S&E Doctoral Employment Growth in academic employment was stronger for life\nscientists than for other scientists and engineers. In engineering and many other science fields, growth in academic employment slowed in the early 1990s, but increased from 1995 to 2006 (figure 5-17; appendix table 5-17).\nTrends in academic employment of S&E doctorate holders suggest continual movement away from the full-time faculty position as the academic norm (figure 5-18). Although academic employment of S&E doctorate holders grew from 118,000 in 1973 to 274,200 in 2006 (appendix table 5-17), during this period, full-time faculty positions increased more slowly than postdoc and other full- and part-time positions.\nTable 5-12 shows the resulting distribution of academic employment of S&E doctorate holders. The full-time faculty share was 72% of all academic employment in 2006,\n\ndown from 88% in the early 1970s. These employment trends, particularly during the 1993\u00ad2006 period, occurred as real spending for academic R&D rose by 73%, retirement of faculty who were hired during the 1960s increased, and academic hiring of young doctorate holders showed a modest rebound.24\nNonfaculty ranks (i.e., full- and part-time adjunct faculty, lecturers, research associates, administrators, and postdocs) increased from 41,400 in 1993 to 76,600 in 2006. This 85% increase stood in sharp contrast to the 15% rise in the number of full-time faculty. Both the full-time nonfaculty and part-time components grew between 1993 and 2006. The number of postdocs rose more slowly during most of this period, remaining at 16,000\u00ad19,000 from 1995 to 2003 before increasing to about 23,000 in 2006.25 Part-time employees accounted for only a small share (between 2% and 4%) of all academic S&E doctoral employment throughout most of the period before rising to almost 6% in 2006 (appendix table 5-17).\n\nFigure 5-16 Average annual growth rate for employment of S&E doctorate holders: 1973\u00ad2006\n\nPercent\n10 Academia\n\nIndustry\n\nGovernment\n\nOther\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0 1973\u00ad83\n\n1983\u00ad93\n\n1993\u00ad2006\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Survey of Doctorate Recipients, special tabulations (preliminary data for 2006).\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nTable 5-10 Average annual growth rate for employment of S&E doctorate holders in U.S. economy: 1973\u00ad2006\n(Percent)\n\nSector\n\n1973\u00ad2006\n\n1973\u00ad83\n\n1983\u00ad93\n\n1993\u00ad2006\n\nAll sectors...............................................................................\n\n3.3\n\nAcademia ............................................................................\n\n2.7\n\nIndustry ...............................................................................\n\n4.7\n\nGovernment ........................................................................\n\n3.4\n\nOther ...................................................................................\n\n1.9\n\n5.4\n\n2.5\n\n2.2\n\n4.1\n\n2.0\n\n2.2\n\n7.9\n\n4.1\n\n2.8\n\n5.5\n\n2.5\n\n2.4\n\n5.3\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Survey of Doctorate Recipients, special tabulations (preliminary data for 2006).\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 5-27\n\nTable 5-11 S&E doctorate holders employed in academia, by years since doctorate: Selected years, 1973\u00ad2006\n(Percent)\n\nYears since doctorate\n\n1973\n\n1983\n\n1993\n\n2006\n\nAll employed doctorate holders ............................................. 3 ........................................................................................ 4\u00ad7 ...................................................................................... >7 ........................................................................................\n\n54.8\n\n48.4\n\n45.9\n\n45.4\n\n55.2\n\n48.0\n\n50.5\n\n57.3\n\n55.8\n\n44.9\n\n47.0\n\n51.1\n\n54.2\n\n49.4\n\n45.0\n\n42.9\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Survey of Doctorate Recipients, special tabulations (preliminary data for 2006).\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nFigure 5-17 S&E doctorate holders employed in academia, by degree field: 1973\u00ad2006\nThousands\n100\n\n80 Life sciences\n\n60 Social sciences\n40 Physical sciences\n\nPsychology 20\n\nEngineering\n\n0 1973\n\nMathematics\n\nComputer sciences\n\n1979 1983 1987 1991 1995 1999 2003 2006\n\nNOTES: Physical sciences include earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences.\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Survey of Doctorate Recipients, special tabulations (preliminary data for 2006).

With the exception of Asians/Pacific Islanders, these groups tended to be less likely than whites to earn S&E degrees or work in S&E occupations. Private and governmental groups have sought to broaden the participation of blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians/Alaska Natives in these fields, with many programs targeting their advanced training through the doctorate level.\nThe absolute rate of conferral of S&E doctorates on members of underrepresented minority groups has increased, as has academic employment; but taken together, blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians/Alaska Natives remain a small percentage of the S&E doctorate holders employed in academia (appendix table 5-20).26 Because the increases in hiring come from a very small base, these groups constituted only about 8% of both total academic employment and fulltime faculty positions in 2006, up from about 2% in 1973. However, among recent doctorate holders, they represented 10% of total academic employment (figure 5-20).\nUnderrepresented minorities constituted a smaller share of total employment at research universities than at other academic institutions throughout this period (table 5-13). Notably, a lower percentage of black S&E faculty than of other S&E faculty are employed at research universities and a higher percentage are employed at comprehensive universities, especially historically black colleges and universities (NSF/SRS 2006). Underrepresented minorities are concentrated in different fields than whites or Asians.

The field distribution of Hispanic degree holders is similar to that of white degree holders. (For a more complete discussion of the role of underrepresented minorities, see NSF/SRS 2007c.)\nAsians/Pacific Islanders in Academic Doctoral S&E Workforce\nAsians/Pacific Islanders more than tripled their employment share in the S&E academic doctoral workforce between 1973 and 2006, increasing from 4% to 14% (appendix table 5-20). However, a distinction needs to be made between those who are U.S. citizens and those who are not because the latter group constituted 45% of this group's doctorate holders in the academic S&E workforce in 2006.27 The employment share of Asians/Pacific Islanders who are U.S. citizens grew from about 2% of the total academic S&E doctoral workforce in 1973 to 9% in 2006, a magnitude of growth similar to that of underrepresented minorities. Limiting the analysis to recent S&E doctorate holders leads to even more dramatic differences between Asians/Pacific Islanders who are U.S. citizens and those who are not. Although the Asian/Pacific Islander share of all recent S&E doctorate holders employed in academia rose from 5% in 1973 to 28% in 2006, the share of those who are U.S. citizens increased from 1% to 7% (figure 5-21).\n\n\f5-30 \n\nChapter 5. Academic Research and Development\n\nCompared with whites, Asians/Pacific Islanders are more heavily represented in engineering and computer sciences and represented at very low levels in psychology and social sciences. This finding holds both for U.S. citizens and for all Asians/Pacific Islanders. In 2006, Asians/Pacific Islanders constituted 29% of academic doctoral computer scientists and 27% of engineers (appendix table 5-20). Whether or not they are U.S. citizens, Asians/Pacific Islanders represent a larger percentage of total employment at research universities than at other academic institutions (table 5-13).\nWhites in Academic Doctoral S&E Workforce The relative prominence of whites, particularly white\nmales, in the academic S&E doctoral workforce diminished between 1973 and 2006 (figure 5-22). In 2006, whites constituted 78% of the academic doctoral S&E workforce, compared with 91% in 1973 (table 5-14; appendix table 5-20); the share of white males also declined during this period, from about 83% to 52%. The decline in the shares of whites and white males who recently received their doctorates was even greater, from 91% to 63% and from 80% to 35%, respectively. Part of the decline is due to the increasing numbers of women, underrepresented minorities, and Asians/ Pacific Islanders. However, the decline in share is not the whole story. During the 1990s and through 2006, the absolute number of white males in the academic doctoral S&E workforce who recently received their doctorates remained virtually unchanged.\n\nFigure 5-21 Share of Asians/Pacific Islanders among S&E doctorate holders employed in academia, by citizenship status and years since degree: Selected years, 1973\u00ad2006\n\nPercent 30\n25\n20\n\nAll S&E doctorates U.S. citizen, S&E doctorates All recent S&E doctorates U.S. citizen, recent S&E doctorates\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0 1973\n\n1983\n\n1993\n\n2006\n\nNOTES: Denominator always refers to set of individuals defined in legend.

Because many foreign-born S&E doctorate holders in U.S. academic institutions did not earn their doctorate in the United States, the data in this section are taken from the Department of Education's National Survey of Postsecondary Faculty, which, although it has a smaller sample size and thus less detail by field and other employment characteristics, has information on faculty with non-U.S. doctorates.\nFull-time doctoral S&E faculty are increasingly foreign born. In 2003, 28% of all full-time doctoral S&E faculty and 33% of full-time doctoral faculty in research institutions in the United States were foreign born, up from 21% and 25%, respectively, in 1992 (appendix table 5-21). In the physical sciences, mathematics, computer sciences, and engineering, 47% of full-time doctoral S&E faculty in research institutions were foreign born, up from 38% in 1992.\nThe Aging Professoriate and Trends in Retirement\nFrom 1993 to 2003, retirement rates among doctoral scientists and engineers employed in academic institutions remained relatively stable, despite the application of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 to colleges and universities in 1994.28 The act, which prohibits mandatory retirement on the basis of age, raised questions about the\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 5-31\n\nTable 5-14 White and white male S&E doctorate holders employed in academia, by years since degree: Selected years, 1973\u00ad2006\n\n1973\n\n1983\n\n1993\n\n2006\n\nGroup\n\nThousands Percent Thousands Percent Thousands Percent Thousands Percent\n\nAll S&E doctorate holders ...................... 118.0\n\n100\n\n176.3\n\n100\n\n213.8\n\n100\n\n274.2\n\n100\n\nWhite................................................... 107.7\n\n91\n\n157.4\n\n89\n\n181.8\n\n85\n\n213.0\n\n78\n\nMale .................................................\n\n97.8\n\n83\n\n134.1\n\n76\n\n141.8\n\n66\n\n143.9\n\n52\n\nRecent S&E doctorate holders ...........\n\n25.0\n\n100\n\n20.5\n\n100\n\n25.1\n\n100\n\n33.9\n\n100\n\nWhite ...............................................\n\n22.8\n\n91\n\n17.3\n\n84\n\n18.0\n\n72\n\n21.3\n\n63\n\nMale .............................................\n\n20.0\n\n80\n\n12.3\n\n60\n\n11.4\n\n45\n\n11.7\n\n35\n\nNOTES: Recent doctorate holders earned degrees within 3 years of survey.\n\nSOURCE: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Survey of Doctorate Recipients, special tabulations (preliminary data for 2006).\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nconsequences for higher education of an aging professoriate, including fewer academic employment opportunities for new doctorate holders (NRC 1991). Among S&E doctorate holders ages 56\u00ad75 whose most recent employment was in the education sector, the percentage who were retired changed little between 1993 and 2003 (NSF/SRS 2008), despite the elimination of mandatory retirement.\nAlthough retirement rates changed little, the age distribution of academic S&E doctorate holders has changed over the past several decades (appendix table 5-22), the percentage of those who are age 65 or older having increased. Fulltime S&E faculty employed in research universities account for about 40% of full-time S&E faculty ages 65 and older (figure 5-23). They also have a slightly greater propensity to work longer than faculty in other institutions: 8% of fulltime S&E faculty in research universities are ages 65 and\n\nolder, compared with 6% of those in master's colleges and universities (appendix table 5-23).\nRecent S&E Doctorate Holders\nTrends in academic employment patterns of those with recently awarded S&E doctorates show a decrease in the share of recent doctorate holders in full-time faculty positions and an increase in postdocs (figure 5-24; appendix table 5-24). Between 1973 and 2006, the share of recent doctorate holders hired into full-time faculty positions fell from 74% to 38%. Conversely, the overall share of recent S&E doctorate holders who reported being in postdoc positions rose from 13% to 46%. After increasing throughout the 1990s, the share of recent S&E doctorate holders in postdoc positions declined from 1999 to 2003 before rising to a new peak in\n\nFigure 5-23 Age distribution of S&E doctorate holders employed in U.S. academic institutions: 2006\n\nNumber\n\n8,000 7,000\n\nAll full-time faculty\n\nFull-time faculty in research universities\n\n6,000\n\n5,000\n\n4,000\n\n3,000\n\n2,000\n\n1,000\n\n0 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50 52 54 56 58 60 62 64 66 68 70 72 74 76\n\nNOTES: Research universities are doctorate-granting universities with very high research activity.

Recent S&E doctorate holders who entered academic employment at research universities were more likely to be in postdoc than in faculty positions (appendix table 5-25). (See the discussion of postdocs in chapter 3, \"Science and Engineering Labor Force,\" for more information, including reasons for accepting a postdoc position and short-term career trajectory.)\nYoung Doctorate Holders With a Track Record For those employed in academia 4\u00ad7 years after earning\ntheir doctorates, the picture looks quite similar: about 61% had faculty rank in 2006, compared with 89% in 1973 (appendix table 5-24). A little more than half of these doctorate holders were in tenure-track positions in 2006, with about 9% already tenured (figure 5-25).\nAcademic Researchers\nThis section examines the number and characteristics of academic S&E doctorate holders for whom research is either a primary or secondary work activity. Note that estimates of the total number of academic researchers would include S&E faculty and postdocs as well as research assistants (see\n\nFull-time faculty 80\nTotal tenure-track 60\nTenure track, untenured 40\nTenured 20\n\n0 1973\n\n1979 1983 1987 1991 1995 1999 2003 2006\n\nNOTES: Faculty positions include full, associate, and assistant professors and instructors.

In addition, many other students, both graduate and undergraduate, are also likely to be involved in research activities during the course of their graduate education.\nResearch as Either Primary or Secondary Work Activity\nFrom 1973 to 2006, the number of academic S&E doctorate holders reporting research as their primary or secondary work activity showed greater growth than the number reporting teaching as their primary or secondary activity. The former group increased from 82,300 in 1973 to 184,400 in 2006, and the latter group increased from 94,900 to 164,000 (appendix table 5-26).29\nThe life sciences accounted for much of this trend, with researchers growing from 26,000 to 67,100 and teachers from about the same base (25,300) to 45,800 (figure 5-26). The other fields generally included fewer researchers than teachers in the 1970s and early 1980s, but this pattern reversed after that time in the physical sciences and engineering.\nRelative to all S&E doctoral employment, the number of academic S&E doctorate holders reporting research as either their primary or secondary activity declined between 1973 and 1977; was relatively constant at about 60% from\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 5-33\n\nFigure 5-26 S&E doctorate holders employed in academia with research or teaching as primary or secondary work activity, by degree field: 1973 and 2006\n\nPhysical sciences\nMathematics\n\n2006 teaching 2006 research 1973 teaching 1973 research\n\nComputer sciences NA NA\nLife sciences\n\nPsychology\n\nSocial sciences\n\nEngineering\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nThousands\n\nNA = not available\n\nNOTE: Research includes basic or applied research, development, or design.

Table 5-15 shows the trends in research involvement by field, and table 5-16 indicates that the distribution across fields of S&E doctorate holders who report research as their primary or secondary work activity is quite similar to that of all S&E doctorate holders.\nResearch universities employ about 43% of all S&E doctorate holders employed in academic institutions and more than half of those whose primary or secondary work activity is research. They also employ about 76% of S&E postdocs, almost all of whom have research as a primary or secondary work activity (appendix table 5-27).\nTime Spent in Research In 2003, full-time doctoral S&E instructional faculty\nspent about 27% of their time in research, 52% of their time teaching, and 20% of their time engaged in other activities. The average percentage of time spent in research did not change between 1992 and 2003, but the average percentage of time spent in teaching increased (appendix table 5-28). In 2003, faculty who taught only graduate students spent a higher percentage of their time in research than faculty who taught only undergraduates, and faculty in research institutions spent a higher percentage of their time in research than faculty in nonresearch institutions.\nThe fraction of full-time doctoral S&E instructional faculty engaged primarily in research increased during the past decade (appendix table 5-29). In 2003, 26% of full-time doctoral S&E instructional faculty were so engaged, compared with 20% in 1992. The fraction engaged primarily in teaching dropped during the past decade, from 61% in 1992 to 53% in 2003. This drop occurred in S&E and non-S&E fields and among doctoral and nondoctoral faculty. Relatively few nondoctoral faculty are engaged in research.\n\nTable 5-15 S&E doctorate holders employed in academia reporting research as primary or secondary activity, by degree field: Selected years, 1973\u00ad2006\n(Percent)\n\nDegree field\n\n1973\n\n1983\n\n1993\n\n2006\n\nAll fields ...........................................................................................\n\n69.7\n\n59.5\n\n70.2\n\n67.3\n\nPhysical sciences ........................................................................\n\n73.7\n\n64.9\n\n71.4\n\n68.1\n\nMathematics ................................................................................\n\n70.1\n\n55.8\n\n61.3\n\n65.9\n\nComputer sciences......................................................................\n\nNA\n\n80.0\n\n80.0\n\n69.9\n\nLife sciences ................................................................................\n\n74.5\n\n69.8\n\n76.0\n\n69.8\n\nPsychology ..................................................................................\n\n59.8\n\n50.0\n\n59.6\n\n58.3\n\nSocial sciences ............................................................................\n\n61.1\n\n45.8\n\n66.0\n\n65.4\n\nEngineering ..................................................................................\n\n72.6\n\n61.9\n\n75.8\n\n72.3\n\nNA = not available\n\nNOTES: Research includes basic or applied research, development, and design.

See appendix tables 5-17 and 5-26.\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nGovernment Support of Academic Doctoral Researchers\nAcademic researchers rely on the federal government for a substantial share (more than 60%) of their overall research support. The institutional and field distributions of these funds are well documented, but little is known about their distribution among researchers. This section presents data from reports by S&E doctorate holders in academia about the presence or absence of federal support for their work. However, nothing is known about the magnitude of these funds to individual researchers. (See sidebar, \"Interpreting Federal Support Data.\")\nAppendix table 5-30 shows the percentage of academic S&E doctorate holders who received federal support for their work during the period 1973\u00ad2006, broken out by field. The analysis examines the overall pool of doctoral S&E researchers as well as young doctorate holders, for whom support may be especially critical in establishing a productive research career.\nAcademic Scientists and Engineers Who Receive Federal Support\nIn 2006, 47% of all S&E doctorate holders in academia and 58% of those for whom research was a primary or secondary activity reported federal government support (appendix table 5-30). As table 5-17 shows, for S&E as a whole and for many broad fields, the likelihood of receiving federal support in 2006 was either the same as it was in 1991 or lower.\nThe percentage of S&E doctorate holders in academia who received federal support differed greatly across the S&E fields. In 2006, this percentage ranged from about 58% in the life sciences and 56% in the physical sciences to 23% in the social sciences (table 5-17; appendix table 5-30).\n\nInterpreting Federal Support Data\nInterpretation of the data on federal support of academic researchers is complicated by a technical difficulty. Between 1993 and 1997, respondents to the Survey of Doctorate Recipients were asked whether work performed during the week of April 15 was supported by the federal government; in most other survey years, the reference was to the entire preceding year, and in 1985, it was to 1 month. However, the volume of academic research activity is not uniform over the entire academic year. A 1-week (or 1-month) reference period seriously understates the number of researchers supported over an entire year. Thus, the numbers for 1985 and 1993\u00ad97 cannot be compared directly with results for the earlier years or those from the 1999 through 2006 surveys, which again used an entire reference year.\nThe discussion in this edition of Indicators generally compares data for 2006 with data for 1991. All calculations express the proportion of those with federal support relative to the number responding to this question. The reader is cautioned that, given the nature of these data, the trends discussed are broadly suggestive rather than definitive. The reader also is reminded that the trends in the proportion of all academic researchers supported by federal funds occurred against a background of rising overall numbers of academic researchers.\n\nTable 5-17 S&E doctorate holders employed in academia reporting receipt of federal support in previous year, by degree field: Selected years, 1973\u00ad2006\n(Percent)\n\nDegree field\n\n1973 1983 1991 2006\n\nAll fields ................................

See appendix table 5-30.\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 5-35\n\nFull-time faculty and other full-time doctoral employees received federal support less frequently than postdocs. In 2006, about 46% of full-time faculty, 47% of other full-time employees, and 71% of postdocs received federal support. As indicated earlier, these proportions were lower than those in 1991 but dropped less for full-time faculty than for postdocs or other full-time positions (appendix table 5-30).\nNSF and NIH Support for Young Investigators\nThe share of all NSF grants awarded to new principal investigators (PIs) remained relatively constant from 2002 to 2006, at roughly 27%\u00ad28%, while the number of proposal submissions from both new and prior investigators increased and the funding rate both per PI and per proposal decreased. Although the number of new PIs awarded NSF grants remained relatively stable (about 5,300) for the past 5 years, the PI funding rate (based on any award to a PI in a 3-year period) declined, from 30% in 2000\u00ad02 to 24% in 2004\u00ad06. The number of prior PIs receiving NSF funding also remained relatively stable (about 11,300) for the past 5 years, and the PI funding rate declined, from 54% in 2000\u00ad02 to 47% in 2004\u00ad06. These success rates based on PIs are somewhat higher than success rates based on proposals, as many investigators submit multiple proposals. When funding rates are calculated based on the number of proposals submitted, the proposal success rate between 2002 and 2006 declines from 19% to 15% for new PIs and from 32% to 26% for prior PIs.\nThe trend at NIH was similar: the number of new investigators remained stable over time and the funding rate for both new and prior PIs declined in recent years. However, the percentage of all competing Research Project (R01) equivalent awardees who were new awardees declined from 12% in 1980 to 7% in 2005. The average age of new doctoral investigators receiving their first NIH research grant rose from 37 in 1979 to 42 in 2002 (NRC 2005). The proportion of NIH research grant recipients under age 40 dropped from 50% in 1980 to 17% in 2003. Responding to this trend, NIH created the Pathway to Independence award in 2006, which combines funding for up to 2 years of training in a postdoc position and up to 3 years for independent research as a faculty member. The hope is that these awards will be an incentive for universities and colleges to create new positions for these investigators and that the awards will help new investigators win R01 research grants (Kaiser 2006).\n\nFederal Support of Young S&E Doctorate Holders in Academia\nEarly receipt of federal support is viewed as critical to launching a promising academic research career. The pattern of support for young researchers is similar to that of the overall academic S&E doctoral workforce. In 2006, S&E doctorate holders with recently earned doctorates (i.e., doctorates earned within 3 years of the survey) who were in full-time faculty positions were less likely to receive federal support than those in postdoc or other full-time positions (appendix table 5-31). For full-time faculty, the percentage reporting federal support in 2006 was lower for those with recently earned doctorates than for the academic S&E doctoral workforce as a whole (appendix tables 5-30 and 5-31). (See sidebar, \"NSF and NIH Support for Young Investigators.\") It should be pointed out that these data provide no information about whether an individual reporting federal support is being supported as a principal investigator on a research project or is participating in a more dependent status rather than as an independent researcher.\nIn 2006, about half of those with recently earned doctorates received federal support, with 30% of those in full-time faculty positions, 51% of those in other full-time positions, and 69% of those in postdoc positions (appendix table 5-31). As with all academic doctorate holders, younger researchers were less likely to report federal support in 2006 than in 1991. The share of postdocs with federal support was relatively low (less than 60%) in some fields (e.g., the social sciences and mathematics) and higher in others (e.g., computer sciences, physical sciences, and engineering).\n\nTable 5-18 S&E doctorate holders employed in academia 4\u00ad7 years after receiving degree reporting receipt of federal support in previous year, by degree field: Selected years, 1973\u00ad2006\n(Percent)\n\nDegree field\n\n1973 1983 1991 2006\n\nAll fields ................................

Academic Research and Development\n\nAmong full-time faculty and postdocs in 2006, those who had received their doctorate 4\u00ad7 years earlier were considerably more likely to receive federal support than those with recently earned doctorates. However, those who had received their doctorate 4-7 years earlier were also less likely to receive support in 2006 than in 1991 (table 5-18; appendix table 5-31).\nOutputs of S&E Research: Articles and Patents\nChapter 2 of this volume and the previous section of this chapter discuss the outputs of S&E research and education in terms of human capital. This section examines additional indicators of the output of academic S&E research: articles published in the world's S&E literature and patents received by U.S. academic institutions. In addition, licensing activities, royalties, and startups associated with university research are also discussed.\nPublished, peer-reviewed articles have traditionally been the means by which scientists and engineers report the results of their research and gain status in their fields. According to sociologist Robert K. Merton,\nThe institutional conception of science as part of the public domain is linked with the imperative for communication of findings. Secrecy is the antithesis of this norm; full and open communication its enactment. The pressure for diffusion of results is reinforced by the institutional goal of advancing the boundaries of knowledge and by the incentive of recognition which is, of course, contingent upon publication. (Merton, 1973, p. 274; see also de Solla Price 1978)\nThis section uses data on S&E articles to indicate world S&E knowledge production by country and by selected regions and/or groupings of countries related by geography, cultural ties, language, or political factors. Coauthorship of articles by researchers in different departments, different institutions, and different countries and regions illustrates the increasing trend of collaboration in research, both within and across countries and regions.\nCitation of research articles indicates, albeit imperfectly, the relative importance of previously published research findings to future research; consequently, patterns in citation are also discussed in this section. Citation patterns, including trends in highly cited research articles, are contrasted with trends in total publication of articles.\nThe discussion of research outputs concludes with indicators of the flow of knowledge from academically based research to intellectual capital embodied in patents awarded to academic institutions, along with related other indicators.\nS&E Article Output\nThe number of S&E articles in the dataset analyzed in this chapter totaled 10.6 million for the period 1988\u00ad2005.30 In the past 10 years, the total world S&E article output as\n\ncontained in the Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) (see sidebar, \"Bibliometric Data and Terminology\") grew at an average annual rate of 2.3% (table 5-19). This reflects increases in both the number of articles per journal (from 117 in 1988 to 139 in 2005) and the total number of journals (from 4,093 in 1988 to 4,906 in 2005). Scientists and engineers in institutions in the member states of the European Union authored or coauthored one-third of the world total in 2005,31 followed by the United States with 29% and by 10 Asian countries (hereafter \"Asia-10\") with 20% (figure 5-27; table 5-19).32\nTrends in Country and Regional Authorship Although S&E authors from some 200 countries are rep-\nresented among the articles discussed in this section, these authors are concentrated in a relatively small number of countries (see sidebar, \"Distribution of Publication Data\"). Authors from one country, the United States, dominated global article output in 2005 with 29% of the total, followed by Japan with 8% and the United Kingdom, Germany, and China with 6% each.\nPrevious editions of Indicators and other studies (e.g. NSF/SRS 2007a) reported steadily increasing investments in S&E education and research infrastructure, especially in Asia. As these investments matured and led to increased R&D in those countries, authorship by scientists and engineers in those countries also increased, as did their success in getting articles published in international peer-reviewed journals. Differences in recent rates of growth in article production are striking. Among Asian countries/economies that produce a major number of articles (defined here as more than 10,000 articles in 2005), average annual growth rates between 1995 and 2005 were highest in China, at 17%, and South Korea, at 16% (table 5-19). Taiwan's article output grew rapidly as well, at 9% per year. These high rates of growth in S&E article authorship contrast with much slower rates for the world as a whole (2.3%) and for countries with mature S&E infrastructures such as the United States (0.6%) and the countries of the European Union (1.8%). Russia's change in article output was negative over the 10-year period.\nThe 10-year change rate shown in table 5-19 obscures changes in S&E article output trends that occurred within the period. The growth rate of world output increased from 2.2% on average annually between 1995 and 2000 to 2.4% between 2000 and 2005 (appendix table 5-34). Between 1995 and 2000, U.S. article output was flat at best. This flattening of U.S. article output was the focus of a special NSF study that explored the dimensions of this trend (Bell 2007; Hill et al. 2007; Javitz et al. 2007). Between 2000 and 2005, the U.S. output again turned positive, increasing to an average annual growth rate of 1.3%, more than the 1.1% annual rate of the European Union and less than the 6.3% of the Asia-10 for the same period.\nEven among nations with moderate S&E article production (defined as between 1,000 and 10,000 articles in 2005), a few stand out for increasing their publication over the past decade.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 5-37\n\nBibliometric Data and Terminology\n\nThe article counts, coauthorship data, and citations discussed in this section are derived from S&E articles, notes, and reviews published in a set of the world's most influential scientific and technical journals tracked by Thomson Scientific in the Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index (http://scientific.thomson. com/products/categories/citation/). The data presented here derive from a database prepared for NSF by ipIQ, Inc., formerly CHI Research, Inc., under a license agreement. The data exclude letters to the editor, news stories, editorials, and other content whose central purpose is not the presentation or discussion of scientific data, theory, methods, apparatus, or experiments.\nThese data are not strictly comparable with those presented in editions prior to Science and Engineering Indicators 2004, which were based on a fixed SCI/SSCI journal set. The advantage of the \"expanding\" set of journals is that it better reflects the current mix of journals and articles in the world.\nFor each new year of data, ipIQ reviews the list of journals and updates the master journal file as necessary as new journals appear and old journals no longer appear or are incorporated into new ones. In other words, the S&E journal literature analyzed for these indicators is always evolving as research and publication evolve. The number of journals analyzed by NSF from SCI/SSCI was 4,093 in 1988 and 4,906 in 2005; over the entire period, some 6,760 journals were reflected in the data. SCI and SSCI give good coverage of a core set of internationally recognized peer-reviewed scientific journals, albeit with some English-language bias. The coverage extends to electronic journals, including print journals with electronic versions and electronic-only journals. Journals of regional or local importance may not be covered.\nExcept where noted, author, as used here, means departmental or institutional author. Articles are attributed to countries or sectors by the country or sector of the institutional address(es) given in the article bylines at the time of publication. If the institutional affiliation is not listed, the article would not be attributed to an institutional author and would not be included in the article counts in this chapter. Likewise, coauthorship refers to institutional coauthorship. An article is considered coauthored only if it shows different institutional affiliations or different departments of the same institution. Multiple listings of the same department of an institution are con-\n\nsidered as one institutional author. The same logic applies to cross-sector and international collaboration.\nTwo methods of counting articles based on attribution are used: fractional and whole counts (Gauffriau and Larsen 2005). In fractional counting, credit for an article with authors from more than one institution or country is divided among the collaborating institutions or countries based on the proportion of their participating departments or institutions. In whole counting, each collaborating institution or country receives one credit for its participation in the article. Fractional counting is generally used for article and citation counts, and whole counting for coauthorship data.\nSeveral changes introduced in this edition of Indicators improve the usefulness of the data discussed here but also inhibit comparison with data from the same source used in previous editions.\n Previous editions reported data based on the year an article entered the database (\"tape year\"), not on the year it was published (\"publication year\"). In this edition, data in section one only (\"S&E Article Output\") are reported by publication year through 2005 as contained in the 2006 database or tape year. Publication data in the remaining sections (\"Coauthorship and Collaboration,\" \"Trends in Output and Collaboration Among U.S. Sectors,\" and \"Trends in Citation of S&E Articles\") are reported by tape year as contained in the 2005 database or tape year. Tables and figures refer the reader to which data are reported.\n Breakouts of broad fields of science were adjusted to more closely align with field taxonomies used in other chapters and more commonly recognizable in other NSF/SRS databases and publications. As in previous editions, journals were assigned to 1 of 134 subfields, but these subfields were regrouped into 13 new broad fields (appendix table 5-32). Furthermore, a group of journals in \"professional fields\" reported on in previous editions has been deleted altogether, resulting in slightly reduced totals overall but a more appropriate concept of science, engineering, or technology journals and articles.\n Finally, the country/economy breakouts were updated to parallel more closely discussions elsewhere in this edition (appendix table 5-33).\n\n\f5-38 \n\nChapter 5.

See appendix table 5-34.\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nIn the Middle East, Iran's article output grew at 25% a year, although its output was less than 3,000 in 2005 (table 5-20). In Europe, Turkey33 and Portugal stand out for their rapid growth (16% and 11%, respectively), as do Thailand and Singapore in Asia (14% and 12%, respectively). Brazil stood out in South America with an 11% annual growth rate.\nTrends in Country Rank by S&E Field Figure 5-28 emphasizes that a few countries dominate the\nworld's authorship of S&E articles, and, as noted in the previous discussion, growth rates vary widely across countries. So which countries dominate article authorship by field of S&E, and how are these rankings changing as a result of countries' different rates of growth in publishing?34\nIn a comparison of the top producers of S&E articles in 1995 and 2005, two patterns are evident: (1) U.S. scientists and engineers authored more S&E articles across all fields\n\nthan authors in any other single country in both 1995 and 2005, and (2) overall, the top 20 article-producing countries were similar in both years (table 5-21). Four countries (the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Germany) were the leading countries across all of S&E in both 1995 and 2005, and their ranks did not change over the period. Three countries among the top 20 producers of S&E articles in 2005 were not in that rank in 1995: South Korea, Brazil, and Turkey. Other notable changes in the ranks of topproducing countries were as follows:\n China's high rates of annual growth in S&E article production resulted in its movement from 14th to 5th place in overall S&E article authorship, to 2nd place in engineering and chemistry, and to 3rd place in physics and mathematics. China moved up in rank of authorships in other fields as well.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 5-39\n\nFigure 5-27 S&E article output, by major S&E publishing region/country: 1988\u00ad2005\nThousands 250\nEuropean Union\n200 United States\n150\nAll other 100\nAsia-10 50\n\n0 1988\n\n1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005\n\nNOTES: Article counts from set of journals covered by Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI).

It made gains in other fields as well.\n Taiwan moved up in rank overall and in all fields shown except mathematics.\n India failed to demonstrate the fast growth of other Asia10 countries and lost rank in some fields.\n Brazil and Turkey gained rank across all fields shown.\n Russia, whose growth rate was negative over the period, lost rank across all fields.\nCoauthorship and Collaboration\nIn addition to the increasing volume of the world's S&E published literature discussed in the previous section, another trend was an increase in the number of S&E articles with authors from different institutions. A related and even stronger trend, increases in the number of internationally coauthored S&E articles, was widely noted in previous editions of Indicators.35 The following discussion begins with consideration of broad trends for the world as a whole, moves to regional patterns, and ends with a discussion of countrylevel trends, including selected country-to-country coauthorship patterns and indexes of international collaboration.\n\nDistribution of Publication Data\nThe publication data used in this section are characterized by many data points, of which only a small number have high value and therefore account for a significant proportion of all the data.* For example, of the 179 countries with a 2005 publication record in the database, 23 accounted for 90% of the 710,000 articles published that year (figure 5-28).\nThe United States produces 29% of the world total of the articles analyzed in this section, exerting a dominant influence throughout the broad indicators reported here. A middle tier of 12 countries, each of which produces between 2% and 8% of the world total, accounts for another 49% overall. Six countries, each with between 1% and 2% of the world total, account for 8% of the total. The remaining 158 countries together account for the remaining 14% of the world total. Among the lowest tier of countries in terms of total output are countries considered \"mature\" in S&E, such as Poland, Belgium, Israel, Singapore, and New Zealand.\nIn each of the sections based on publication records (outputs, international coauthorship, citation rates), an effort was made to limit the amount of data to avoid overwhelming the reader. Data cutoff points are defined where appropriate. The underlying assumption of these cutoffs is that some data may be of interest to a particular country or an academic researcher but not important to the overall world trends. Nevertheless occasional note is made to specific countries in the flat end of the distribution shown in figure 5-28 when needed.\n*Data with these properties belong to a related group of distributions collectively referred to as \"power law distributions\" (Adamic 2000). Such distributions have traditionally been studied in linguistics, economics, geosciences, and other fields and today commonly appear in studies of the Internet.\n(Indicators of cross-sector coauthorship, available only for the United States, are examined below in the section \"Trends in Output and Collaboration Among U.S. Sectors.\")\nIndicators of world S&E article output discussed in the previous section show a growing world article output, with just a few dozen countries producing the predominant proportion of all articles. Within that trend lie three additional patterns of interest: a growing tendency for articles to list multiple authors, authors from more than one institution, and authors from more than one country.\nPrevious editions of Indicators used coauthorship data as an indicator of collaboration among scientists and discussed possible underlying drivers for increased collaboration, including scientific advantages of knowledge and instrument sharing, decreasing costs of travel and communication, national policies, and so forth (NSB 2006).

The coauthorship data used in this section as indicators of collaboration in S&E research are presented with knowledge of neither the motive(s) underlying the collaboration nor the nature of the collaboration that actually occurred.36 They should be seen as broad indicators of a secular trend in the S&E publishing record that reflects changes in the way S&E research is conducted and reported in today's world.\nArticle Author Names and Institutions Indicators of the extent of these changes are shown in\nfigure 5-29, which depicts the annual number of S&E articles published worldwide relative to the number of author\n\nnames37 and different institutions that appear in article bylines. Between 1988 and 2005, the number of S&E articles, notes, and reviews grew by 60% and both the number of institutions and the number of author names more than doubled. The number of author names per article for S&E overall increased from 3.1 in 1988 to 4.5 in 2005, and this growth occurred in all of the broad S&E fields (table 5-22). Growth on this indicator was slower in mathematics and the social sciences, and more rapid in physics and the medical sciences.\nA slightly different indicator, coauthored articles, has also increased steadily. Coauthored articles are defined as S&E articles with more than one institutional address in the byline. (\"Institution\" here may refer to different departments or units within the same institution; multiple listings of the same department or unit are counted as one institutional author.) Adams and colleagues (2005) offer several hypotheses that might explain growing collaboration, including special-\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 5-41\n\nFigure 5-28 Worldwide output of S&E articles, by number of article-producing countries: 2005\nPercent 100\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 Number of countries\nNOTES: Article counts from set of journals covered by Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI).

They also argue that increases in the division of labor of scientists on a team lead to increases in scientific productivity. On the other hand, Cummings and Kiesler (2005, 2007) report high coordination costs in studies of two large U.S. government programs that sought to foster collaboration.\nCoauthored articles grew from 40% of the world's S&E articles in 1988 to 61% in 2005 (figure 5-30). This growth has two parts: (1) coauthored articles that list only domestic institutions in the byline, and (2) articles that list institutions from more than one country, that is, internationally coauthored articles, which may also have multiple domestic institutional authors as well. The remainder of this section focuses on these internationally coauthored articles.\nCoauthorship From a Regional Perspective Use of the same region/country categories as in \"S&E\nArticle Output\" above shows changes in the patterns of interregional coauthorship.38 Over the period 1995\u00ad2005, interregional coauthorship increased as a percentage of total article output for the United States (from 17% to 27%), the European Union (from 18% to 26%), and the Asia-10 (from\n\nTable 5-21 Rank in S&E article output, by country/economy and selected S&E broad field: 1995 and 2005\n\nAll fields Engineering Chemistry\n\nBiological Physics Geosciences Mathematics sciences\n\nMedical sciences\n\nCountry/economy 1995 2005 1995 2005 1995 2005 1995 2005 1995 2005 1995 2005 1995 2005 1995 2005\n\nU.S.......................... 1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n11\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nJapan...................... 2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n25\n\n3\n\n8\n\n7\n\nUK........................... 3\n\n3\n\n3\n\n5\n\n6\n\n8\n\n6\n\n72\n\n2\n\n4\n\n5\n\nGermany................. 4\n\n4\n\n4\n\n6\n\n3\n\n4\n\n3\n\n46\n\n5\n\n3\n\n4\n\nChina ...................... 14\n\n5\n\n8\n\n2 11\n\n2\n\n7\n\n3 15\n\n7\n\n9\n\n3\n\nFrance .................... 5\n\n6\n\n6\n\n7\n\n5\n\n6\n\n5\n\n54\n\n6\n\n2\n\n2\n\nCanada ................... 6\n\n7\n\n5\n\n8 10 12\n\n9 12 3\n\n4\n\n5 10\n\nItaly ......................... 8\n\n8 10 10\n\n8 10\n\n8\n\n89\n\n9\n\n6\n\n6\n\nSpain ...................... 11\n\n9 15 12\n\n9\n\n9 11 11 11 10 10\n\n8\n\nSouth Korea............ 22 10 13\n\n4 15 11 15\n\n9 35 19 24 12\n\nAustralia.................. 9 11 12 14 14 17 17 18 7\n\n8 11 13\n\nIndia........................ 12 12\n\n9 11\n\n7\n\n7 10 10 13 12 17 21\n\nRussia..................... 7 13\n\n7 13\n\n4\n\n5\n\n4\n\n6 8 11\n\n7\n\n9\n\nNetherlands ............ 10 14 14 18 13 16 14 17 10 13 13 16\n\nTaiwan .................... 18 15 11\n\n9 17 14 20 13 23 15 20 20\n\nSweden .................. 13 16 16 19 18 21 18 19 12 18 15 18\n\nBrazil....................... 23 17 25 16 25 15 21 15 24 16 19 15\n\nSwitzerland............. 15 18 19 21 16 18 13 16 16 14 16 19\n\nTurkey ..................... 34 19 26 17 29 20 37 25 29 21 44 27\n\nPoland .................... 19 20 18 20 12 13 12 14 27 29 14 14\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n3\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n4\n\n4\n\n4\n\n4\n\n20\n\n7 21 11\n\n5\n\n5\n\n5\n\n7\n\n6\n\n6\n\n7\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n6\n\n5\n\n11\n\n9 11 10\n\n29 13 31 14\n\n8 10\n\n9\n\n9\n\n14 12 19 20\n\n9 18 22 28\n\n10 11\n\n8\n\n8\n\n22 19 20 16\n\n12 14 10 12\n\n19 15 24 17\n\n13 16 12 15\n\n34 24 25 13\n\n25 23 28 26\n\nUK = United Kingdom\n\nNOTES: Countries initially ranked on 2005 total article output.

As a percentage of the world's interregionally coauthored articles, the shares of articles with a U.S. or European Union institutional author declined slightly, giving way to a rise in the share of articles with an institutional author from the Asia-10 (from 22% in 1995 to 28% in 2005). The other regions identified in table 5-23 tend to have a less-developed S&E infrastructure, and scientists and engineers in those regions tend more often to coauthor articles with colleagues in the more scientifically advanced regions/countries. For example, 41% of all S&E articles with an institutional author from the Near East/North Africa (which includes Israel) had an author from another region, as did 59% of S&E articles with an institutional author from Sub-Saharan Africa (which includes South Africa). The following sections look more closely at coauthorship patterns of specific countries and country pairs.\nCoauthorship Patterns From an International Perspective\nWhen the region-level data discussed in the previous section are disaggregated to the country level, a richer picture of international S&E article coauthorship emerges.

The sheer number of U.S. coauthored articles dominates these measures, accounting for 44% of the world total. As discussed in the sidebar \"Distribution of Publication Data,\" a relatively small number of countries account for a large proportion of the world's internationally coauthored articles. But a country's number of internationally coauthored articles (i.e., its \"size\") is not a reliable predictor of the propensity of that country's scientists to engage in international coauthorship (Narin, Stevens, and Whitlow 1991). Countries of very different article output volumes (e.g., the United Kingdom with 28,000 internationally coauthored articles and Finland with 3,400) show similar rates of international coauthorship (44% and 48%, respectively). In contrast, the number of Japan's internationally coauthored articles is similar to Italy's, but Japan's international coauthorship rate (23%) is well below Italy's (43%).\n\nNarin and colleagues (1991) concluded that \"the direction of international coauthorship is heavily dependent on linguistic and historical factors.\" Coauthorship data suggest intriguing \"preferences\" at the national level (Gl\u00e4nzel and Schubert 2005; Schubert and Gl\u00e4nzel 2006) based on the geography, cultural relations, and language of particular pairs or sets of countries, and these preferences have been evolving over time (Gl\u00e4nzel 2001). Some researchers have focused on the growing S&E article output and international coauthorship of particular countries mentioned in the previous section, for example, Korea (Kim 2005), China (Zhou and Leydesdorff 2006), and Turkey (Uzun 2006).\nInternational Coauthorship With the United States When authors of S&E articles from U.S. institutions col-\nlaborate with authors from abroad, in which countries are these authors likely to be located? Table 5-25 lists the 30 countries whose institutions appeared on at least 1% or more of U.S. internationally coauthored articles in 2005. U.S. authors are most likely to coauthor with colleagues from Germany (13.5%), the United Kingdom (13.4%), and Canada (11.9%).\nReaders may note the asymmetry between the columns of data in table 5-25: each country's share of coauthorship in U.S. internationally coauthored articles is lower than the U.S. share of that country's international articles.39 To some extent, the asymmetry may simply reflect the dominating effect of the size of U.S. S&E across the globe, including the number of publishing scientists and engineers (see sidebar, \"Distribution of Publication Data\"). For example, scientists and engineers from Canada may relatively more often collaborate with scientists and engineers in the United States (52%) than the reverse (12%) simply because there are more scientists and engineers in the United States than in Canada.40 Canada and the United States are also close geographically and linguistically, and these factors may reinforce the size effect of the United States. Likewise, the difference in the rates of coauthorship between the United States and Israel (53% for Israel with the United States versus 3% for the United States with Israel) may reflect historical and ethnic factors in addition to the size effect of the United States. The discussion in the next section shows how removing the effect of size identifies specific country pairs of strong coauthorship across the world.\nInternational Collaboration in S&E In developing indicators of international collaboration\nbetween countries and across regions, researchers have developed statistical techniques that account for unequal sizes in countries' S&E article output and coauthorship patterns (Gl\u00e4nzel and Schubert 2004). One of the simplest of these techniques is used in calculating the index of international collaboration shown in table 5-26. A country-to-country index is calculated by dividing a country's rate of collaboration with another country by the other country's rate of international coauthorship (Narin, Stevens, and Whitlow 1991). For example, if 12% of country A's coauthored ar-\n\n\f5-44 \n\nChapter 5.

Indexes greater than 1 represent greater than expected rates of coauthorship, and indexes less than 1 represent less than expected rates of coauthorship.\nTable 5-26 lists the international collaboration index for selected pairs of countries. The indexes for all pairs of countries that produced at least 1% of all internationally coauthored articles in 2005 can be calculated from the data in appendix table 5-35. In North America, the CanadaUnited States index of 1.19 shows a rate of collaboration that is slightly greater than would be expected based solely on the number of internationally coauthored articles produced by each of these two countries. The United States-Mexico index of 0.98 is just about as would be predicted, whereas Mexico's collaboration with Argentina is much stronger than expected, at 3.06. In South America, the collaboration index of Argentina-Brazil, at 5.01, is one of the highest in the world.\nNone of the collaboration indexes between countries on opposite sides of the North Atlantic was as high as expected based on their total international collaboration. In Europe, collaboration patterns were mixed. Among the large publishing countries of Germany, the United Kingdom, and France, collaboration was less than expected. The indexes for France-Spain and Italy-Switzerland were somewhat higher than expected, and very strong rates of collaboration were evident throughout Scandinavia.\nCross-Pacific collaboration was rather weak between the United States and both China and Japan, but somewhat stronger than expected between the United States and both South Korea and Taiwan. Canada showed a lower tendency than the United States to coauthor with other Pacific Rim countries.\nCollaboration indexes between the large article producers within the Asia-10 were generally higher than expected. Indexes for Japan-China and for Japan-South Korea were strong. Australia's collaboration with Singapore (1.72) and New Zealand (4.23) was particularly strong. India collaborated more than would be expected with Japan (1.31) and South Korea (1.84).\nTrends in Output and Collaboration Among U.S. Sectors\nS&E articles authored at academic institutions have traditionally accounted for just under three-fourths of all U.S. articles (appendix table 5-36). This section takes a closer look at nonacademic authorship, including output trends by sector and the extent of coauthorship, both between U.S. sectors and between U.S. sectors and authors abroad. (For a more detailed discussion of industry authorship, see \"Industry Collaboration in Publications\" in chapter 6.)\n\nFigure 5-31 S&E article output of U.S. nonacademic sectors: 1995\u00ad2005\nArticles (thousands)\n18\nPrivate nonprofit 16\n\n14\n\nFederal\n\ngovernment\n\nIndustry\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\nFFRDCs 4\n\n2 State/local government\n0 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005\nFFRDC = federally funded research and development center\nNOTES: Article counts from set of journals covered by Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI).

See appendix table 5-36.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nArticle Output by Sector Total annual publications by authors in U.S. nonacadem-\nic sectors changed little over the past decade (appendix table 5-36). Authorship by scientists and engineers in the federal government and in industry declined overall (figure 5-31). Articles with nonprofit institutional authors have trended upward, primarily due to increases in the medical sciences. State and local government authorship, dominated by articles in the medical and biological sciences, remained constant across the decade. The article output of federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) remained flat until 2002 but has recently shown increases. (See sidebar \"S&E Articles From Federally Funded Research and Development Centers.\")\nTrends in Sector Coauthorship The previous section on \"Coauthorship and Collabora-\ntion\" presented coauthorship data as an indicator of collaboration between and among U.S. and foreign scientists and engineers. This section considers coauthorship data as an indicator of collaboration at the sectoral level between U.S.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 5-47\n\nS&E Articles From Federally Funded Research and Development Centers\n\nFFRDCs are research offices/laboratories sponsored by federal agencies and administered by universities, industry, or other nonprofit institutions. FFRDCs have specialized research agendas closely related to the mission of the sponsoring agency and may house large and unique research instruments not otherwise available in other research venues.\nAlthough all of the broad fields of science considered in this chapter contain articles authored at FFRDCs, a handful of these fields dominates publication by this sector and points to their specialized research programs. Physics articles account for 40% of the FFRDC total (figure 5-32) but only 10% of the academic sector total (appendix table 5-36). Chemistry and engineering articles each account for another 16% of the FFRDC total.\nNine federal agencies (the Departments of Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Transportation, and Treasury, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the National Science Foundation) sponsor some three dozen FFRDCs (NSF/SRS, 2007b), but the 16 centers sponsored by the Department of Energy dominate S&E publishing by this sector. Across all fields of S&E, DOE-sponsored labs accounted for 83% of the total for the sector in 2005. Scientists and engineers at DOEsponsored FFRDCs published 96% of the sector's articles in chemistry, 95% in physics, and 90% in engineering (NSF, special tabulations).\n\nFigure 5-32 S&E articles from FFRDCs, by field: 2005\nAll other fields 4.8% Astronomy 5.2%\nGeosciences 8.3%\n\nBiological sciences 10.4%\n\nPhysics 39.5%\n\nEngineering 15.6%\nChemistry 16.3%\nFFRDC = federally funded research and development center\nNOTES: Article counts from set of journals covered by Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI).

Authors in FFRDCs, industry, and private nonprofit institutions increased their coauthorship with foreign authors by 10 percentage points between 1995 and 2005 (table 5-27). Authors at FFRDCs reached the highest rate of collaboration with foreign authors, at 38%, followed by industry at 26%. Coauthorship with foreign authors increased by 9 percentage points for authors in the federal government and academia and by 5.5 percentage points for authors in state/local government.\nThe extent of coauthorship between U.S. sectors and authors from another country varied by broad field of science. Astronomy had the highest rate of international coauthorship in 2005, at 58%, well above the U.S. national average of 27% across all fields and all sectors (appendix table 5-37). Within astronomy, authors at FFRDCs, in the federal government, in academia, and in private nonprofit institutions increased their international coauthorship over the decade 1995\u00ad2005 at some of the highest rates compared with other\n\nS&E fields. The geosciences, mathematics, and physics also experienced higher than average growth in international coauthorship in most sectors.\nU.S. cross-sectoral coauthorship increased between all sectors except FFRDCs and industry. The largest gains in all sectors were with coauthors in academia (by far the largest sector with the largest pool of potential S&E coauthors). State/local government, the sector with the highest percentage of articles with coauthors from academia in 1995, at 63%, also had the highest percentage in 2005, at 71%, followed by private nonprofit institutions at 62% and the federal government at 59% (table 5-27).\nWithin-sector coauthorship (e.g., FFRDC authors with authors from other FFRDCs) increased as well.42 Starting from the highest base of within-sector coauthorship in 1995, at 36%, academic authors increased their coauthorship with authors from other academic institutions to 43% in 2005. FFRDC-FFRDC coauthorship, and private nonprofit/private nonprofit coauthorship both increased by more than 4 percentage points over the decade.\nExcept for the decline in coauthorship between FFRDCs and industry, the indicators presented in this section show steadily increasing integration between and among the different types of U.S. institutions that publish the results of\n\n\f5-48 \n\nChapter 5.

The data in table 5-27 indicate that more of these coauthors have been from another department within an institution,43 from another institution within the same sector, or from an institution in another sector. Growth in coauthorship has been particularly strong between U.S. authors in all sectors and authors in foreign institutions.\nTrends in Citation of S&E Articles\nWhen scientists and engineers cite the published results of previous research, they are formally crediting the influence of that research on their own work. Previous editions of Indicators presented data on the growing number of worldwide citations to foreign S&E literature. Like the indicators of international coauthorship discussed above, cross-national citations are evidence that S&E research is increasingly international in scope.\nThe indicators discussed here present a coherent picture of a world S&E literature dominated by the United States. At the same time, a decade of increases in the publication of research articles by a few dozen countries in Asia and\n\nEurope has chipped away at the U.S. share on a number of publication indicators. The following sections continue to explore this theme by contrasting worldwide research output trends with worldwide trends in highly cited S&E literature by field.\nCitation Trends in a Global Context Much of the world's S&E research literature is never cited\nin another article, although citation rates vary by field (appendix table 5-38).44 Concomitant with changing shares of the world total of S&E research articles, shares of the world total of citations to these articles have also been changing. Appendix table 5-38 shows, for example, that between 1991\u00ad93 and 2001\u00ad03, the U.S. world share of S&E articles declined from 36% to 30%, while the European Union share grew from 33% to 35% and the Asia-10 share grew from 13% to 18%. Table 5-28 provides the parallel percentages for share of citations, showing a largely similar pattern: a decline for the United States from 50% to 41%, an increase for the European Union from 31% to 34%, and an increase for the Asia-10 from 8% to 13%. Figure 5-33 illustrates these\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 5-49\n\nchanges. Other regions of the world remained relatively unchanged on these indicators during the period.\nTrends in Highly Cited S&E Literature Another indicator of performance of a national or region-\nal S&E system is the share of its articles that are highly cited. High citation rates can indicate that an article has a greater impact on subsequent research than articles with lower citation rates.\nCitation percentiles for 1995, 2000, and 2005 are shown by field and region/country in appendix table 5-38.45 In appendix table 5-38, a region/country whose research influence is disproportionate to its output would have higher numbers of articles at higher citation percentiles, whereas a country whose influence was less than its output would suggest would have higher numbers of articles at lower citation percentiles. In other words, a country whose research has high influence would have higher shares of its articles in higher citation percentiles.\nThis is the case in every field for U.S. articles. Across the 11 years displayed in appendix table 5-38, the U.S. share of articles in the 99th percentile was higher than its share in the 95th percentile, and these were higher than its share in the 90th percentile, and so forth, even while the U.S. share of all articles was decreasing. In contrast, in every field shown\n\nTable 5-28 Share of world citations of S&E articles, by major region/country: 1995, 2000, and 2005\n(Percent)\n\nRegion/country\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\nUnited States.....................\n\n49.6\n\n44.8\n\n40.8\n\nEuropean Union.................\n\n30.6\n\n33.3\n\n33.7\n\nOther Western Europe .......\n\n2.3\n\n2.5\n\n2.5\n\nAsia-10 ..............................\n\n8.2\n\n9.8\n\n12.9\n\nOther Asia..........................\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\nOther former USSR ...........\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\nNear East/North Africa ......\n\n1.0\n\n1.1\n\n1.2\n\nCentral/South America ......\n\n0.7\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\nSub-Saharan Africa ...........\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\nOther..................................\n\n6.3\n\n6.3\n\n6.1\n\nUSSR = Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\n\nNOTES: Article counts from set of journals covered by Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI).

Figure 5-34 displays these relationships for the United States, European Union, and Asia-10; only U.S. publications display the ideal relationship of consistently higher proportions of articles in the higher percentiles of article citations across the period.\nThese data are summarized in appendix table 5-39, which focuses only on the 99th percentile of article citations. As the U.S. share of all articles produced declined between 1995 and 2005, its share of articles in the 99th percentile (i.e., the top 1%) of cited articles also declined, particularly in some fields. The share of articles produced by the European Union and the Asia-10 increased over the same period, as did their shares of articles in the 99th percentile of cited articles.\nHowever, when citation rates are normalized by the share of articles during the citation period to produce an index of highly cited articles, the influence of U.S. articles is shown to increase. Between 1995 and 2005, the U.S. index of highly cited articles increased from 1.73 to 1.83 (figure 5-35).

In other words, the United States had 83% more articles than expected in the 99th percentile of cited articles in 2005, while the European Union had 16% fewer than expected and the Asia-10 had 59% fewer than expected.46\nThe United States experienced notable gains on the index of highly cited articles in engineering, mathematics, and computer sciences (although with relatively low counts in the latter) and declines in chemistry and geosciences (appendix table 5-39). The European Union experienced gains on the index in astronomy, chemistry, and geosciences and reached expectation only in agricultural sciences. The Asia-10 achieved increases in a number of fields, including engineering, chemistry, physics, and geosciences, but did not progress in the biological or medical sciences. The Asia-10's index score nearest expectation was in mathematics, at 0.79.\nAcademic Patents, Licenses, Royalties, and Startups\nOther indicators of academic R&D outputs reflect universities' efforts to capitalize on their intellectual property in the form of patents and associated activities.47 Although some U.S. universities were granted patents much earlier, the majority did not become actively involved in the management of their own intellectual property until late in the 20th century.48 The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 gave colleges\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 5-51\n\nand universities ownership of income streams from patented discoveries that resulted from their federally funded research. To facilitate the conversion of new knowledge produced in their laboratories to patent-protected public knowledge that can be potentially licensed by others or form the basis for a startup firm, more and more research institutions established technology management/transfer offices.\nEfforts to encourage links between university-based research and commercial exploitation of the results of that research have been widely studied by researchers. Mowery (2002) notes the strong growth in funding by NIH and the predominance of biomedical-related patenting by universities in the 1990s. Branstetter and Ogura (2005) identify a \"bio-nexus\" in patent-to-paper citations, and Owen-Smith and Powell (2003) explore the effects of an academic medical center as part of the \"scientific capacity\" of a research university. In a qualitative study of two research universities that would appear to have similar capacities, Owen-Smith and Powell (2001) examine the very different rates of invention disclosure of the two campuses. Stephan and colleagues (2007) found strong differences in patenting activity among university scientists by field of science; a strong relationship between publication activity and patenting by individual researchers; and patenting among university researchers restricted to a small set of the potential population.\nThe following sections discuss overall trends in university patenting through 2005 and related indicators.\nUniversity Patenting Trends U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) data show\nthat patent grants to universities and colleges increased sharply from 1995 to about 2002, when they peaked at just under 3,300 patents per year, and then fell to about 2,700 in 2005 (appendix table 5-40).49 (However, this decline contrasts with recent increases in the related indicators of invention disclosures and patent applications filed by academic institutions, which are discussed in the next section, \"Patentrelated activities and income.\") The top R&D-performing institutions, with 95% of the total, dominate among universities and university systems receiving patent protection.50 College and university patenting as a percentage of U.S. nongovernmental patents grew in the 1980s and 1990s from less than 2% to just under 5%, and then declined to about 4.2% by 2005 (figure 5-36).\nThe previous edition of Indicators noted that three biomedically related utility classes dominated university patenting in the 1980s and 1990s (NSB 2006, pp. 5-54 and 5-55). In 2005, these same three classes together accounted for more than one-third of all utility patents awarded to U.S. academic institutions: drug, bio-affecting and body treating compositions (15.4%); chemistry: molecular biology and microbiology (13.8%); and organic compounds (5.6%) (appendix table 5-41). Other medical and life sciences-related classes of patents, although smaller than the top three in number of patents awarded, also ranked high on the list of top patent utility classes awarded to universities.\n\nPatent-Related Activities and Income In contrast to the USPTO-reported decline in the total\nnumber of patents awarded to U.S. universities and colleges in 2004 and 2005 (appendix table 5-40), data from the Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM) indicate continuing growth in a number of related activities. Invention disclosures filed with university technology management offices describe prospective inventions and are submitted before a patent application is filed. These grew from 13,700 in 2003 to 15,400 in 2005 (notwithstanding a small decline in respondent institutions to the AUTM survey over the same period) (appendix table 5-42). Likewise, new U.S. patent applications filed by the AUTM respondents also increased, from 7,200 in 2003 to 9,500 in 2004 and 9,300 in 2005 (appendix table 5-42).\nMost royalties from licensing agreements accrue to relatively few patents and relatively few of the universities that hold them, and many of the AUTM respondent offices report negative income. (Thursby and colleagues [2001] note that the objectives of university technology management offices include more than royalty income.) At the same time, onetime payments to one university can complicate analysis of the overall trend in university income due to patenting. The median net royalty per university respondent to the AUTM surveys has both risen and fallen since 1996 but overall climbed from $440,000 in 1996 to $950,000 in 2005 (figure 5-37).\nDuring the same period, the inventory of revenuegenerating licenses and options across all AUTM respondent institutions increased, from 5,000 in 1996 to more than\n\nFigure 5-36 U.S. academic share of patenting by U.S. private and nonprofit sectors: 1981\u00ad2005\nPercent\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0 1981\n\n1985\n\n1989\n\n1993\n\n1997\n\n2001\n\n2005\n\nNOTES: Patents issued by U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to U.S. universities and corporations.

New licenses and options executed grew steadily to more than 4,000/year in both 2004 and 2005. The annual number of startup companies established as a result of university-based inventions rebounded after 2 years of downturns in 2002 and 2003 to more than 400 in both 2004 and 2005.\nConclusion\nU.S. universities and colleges continued to be important participants in U.S. R&D during the first decade of the 21st century, performing more than half the basic research nationwide and having a significant presence in applied research. Funding of academic R&D from all major sources and across all broad S&E fields continued to expand. Since 2000, average annual growth in R&D has been stronger for the academic sector than for any other R&D-performing sector. Both the overall academic S&E doctoral workforce and the academic research workforce have also continued to increase. Citation data indicate that U.S. scientific publications remain highly influential relative to those of other countries. However, the relative volume of U.S. article output has not kept up with the increasing outputs of the European Union and the Asia-10. In fact, the number of U.S. articles published in the world's leading S&E journals has only recently begun to increase again after being essentially level since the early to mid-1990s.\nAlthough funding for academic R&D has been increasing, a number of shifts in funding sources have occurred, the long-term implications of which are uncertain. After increasing between 2000 and 2004, the federal government's share of funding for academic R&D began to decrease in 2005 and again in 2006. In addition, for the first time since 1982, federal funding did not keep pace with inflation. Industry support for\n\nacademic R&D, after growing faster than any other source of support through the turn of the century, declined in real absolute dollars for 3 successive years before rising again in both 2005 and 2006. The state and local share of support for academic R&D reached an all-time low in 2006. Researchperforming universities have increased the amount of their own funds devoted to research every year since 1993.\nThe structure and organization of academic R&D have also changed. Research-performing colleges and universities continued to expand their stock of research space, particularly in the biological and medical sciences. However, spending on research equipment as a share of all R&D expenditures declined to an all-time low of 4.0% by 2006. With regard to personnel, a researcher pool has grown, independent of growth in the faculty ranks, as academic employment continued a long-term shift toward greater relative use of nonfaculty appointments. This shift has been marked by a substantial increase in the number of postdocs over a long period. These changes occurred during a period in which both the median age of the academic workforce and the percentage of that workforce age 65 or older have risen.\nA demographic shift in academic employment has also been under way, with increases in the proportion of women, Asians/Pacific Islanders, and underrepresented minorities in the S&E academic workforce. This shift is expected to continue into the future. Among degree holders who are U.S. citizens, white males have been earning a decreasing number of S&E doctorates. On the other hand, the number of S&E doctorates earned by U.S. women and members of minority groups has been increasing, and these new doctorate holders were more likely to enter academia than white males. A more demographically diverse faculty, by offering more varied role models, may attract students from a broader range of backgrounds to S&E careers.\nAcademic R&D is also becoming more international in a number of ways. U.S. academic scientists and engineers are collaborating extensively with colleagues in other countries: in 2005, more than one in four journal articles with a U.S. author also had at least one coauthor from abroad. The intimate linkage between research and U.S. graduate education, regarded as a model by other countries, helps to bring large numbers of foreign students to the United States, many of whom stay after graduation. Academia has also been able to attract many talented foreign-born scientists and engineers into its workforce, with the percentage of foreign-born fulltime doctoral S&E faculty in research institutions approaching half the total in some fields.\nNotes\n1. Federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) associated with universities are tallied separately and are examined in greater detail in chapter 4. FFRDCs and other national laboratories (including federal intramural laboratories) also play an important role in academic research and education, providing research opportunities for both students and faculty at academic institutions.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 5-53\n\n2. For this discussion, an academic institution is generally defined as an institution that has a doctoral program in science or engineering, is a historically black college or university that expends any amount of separately budgeted R&D in S&E, or is some other institution that spends at least $150,000 for separately budgeted R&D in S&E.\n3. Despite this delineation, the term \"R&D\" (rather than just \"research\") is primarily used throughout this discussion because data collected on academic R&D do not always differentiate between research and development. Moreover, it is often difficult to make clear distinctions between basic research, applied research, and development.\n4. The academic R&D reported here includes separately budgeted R&D and related recovered indirect costs, as well as institutional estimates of unreimbursed indirect costs associated with externally funded R&D projects, including mandatory and voluntary cost sharing.\n5. Federal grants and contracts and awards from other sources that are passed through state and local governments to academic institutions are credited to the original provider of the funds.\n6. This follows a standard of reporting that assigns funds to the entity that determines how they are to be used rather than to the one that necessarily disburses the funds.\n7. It also likely includes some amount of research funding from the above-named sources that universities are unable to accurately code for reporting to the Academic R&D Survey of Research and Development Expenditures at Universities and Colleges.\n8. The medical sciences include fields such as pharmacy, neuroscience, oncology, and pediatrics. The biological sciences include fields such as microbiology, genetics, epidemiology, and pathology. These distinctions may be blurred at times because boundaries between fields often are not well defined.\n9. In this section of the chapter and section, \"Doctoral Scientists and Engineers in Academia,\" the broad S&E fields refer to the computer sciences, environmental sciences (sometimes referred to as \"earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences\"), life sciences, mathematical sciences, physical sciences, psychology, social sciences, other sciences (those not elsewhere classified), and engineering. The more disaggregated S&E fields are referred to as \"subfields.\" The third section, \"Outputs of S&E Research: Articles and Patents,\" groups the broad fields and subfields slightly differently (see sidebar, \"Bibliometric Data and Terminology\" and appendix table 5-32).\n10. The discussion of federal support for academic R&D in the previous section is based on reporting by performer, i.e., academic institutions. This section is based on reporting by funder--the government agencies that provide R&D support to academic institutions. Performing and funding series may differ for many reasons. For a more detailed discussion of the differences between these two sources, see chapter 4 sidebar, \"Tracking R&D: Gap Between Performer- and Source-Reported Expenditures.\"\n\n11. The recent creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) should have major implications for the future distribution of federal R&D funds, including federal academic R&D support, among the major R&D funding agencies. DHS's Directorate of Science and Technology is tasked with researching and organizing the scientific, engineering, and technological resources of the United States and leveraging these existing resources into technological tools to help protect the homeland. Universities, the private sector, and the federal laboratories are expected to be important DHS partners in this endeavor.\n12. Another hypothesis is that some of the difference may be due to many public universities not having the incentive to negotiate full recovery of indirect costs of research because the funds are frequently captured by state governments.\n13. Although the number of institutions receiving federal R&D support between 1973 and 1994 increased overall, a rather large decline occurred in the early 1980s, most likely due to the fall in federal R&D funding for the social sciences during that period.\n14. Part of the decline in R&D equipment intensity may be due to a threshold effect, i.e., institutions not reporting purchases of equipment under a certain dollar threshold. There is some evidence that the minimum dollar value at which purchases of research equipment are reported in the Survey of Research and Development Expenditures at Universities and Colleges has been increasing over the years, leading to some equipment that would have been reported in earlier years not being reported in more recent years.\n15. Research-performing academic institutions are defined as colleges and universities that grant degrees in science or engineering and expend at least $1 million in R&D funds. Each institution's R&D expenditure is determined through the NSF Survey of Research and Development Expenditures at Universities and Colleges.\n16. Research space here is defined as the space used for sponsored R&D activities at academic institutions that is separately budgeted and accounted for. Research space is measured in NASF, the sum of all areas on all floors of a building assigned to, or available to be assigned to, an occupant for a specific use, such as research or instruction. NASF is measured from the inside faces of walls. Multipurpose space that is at least partially used for research is prorated to reflect the proportion of time and use devoted to research.\n17. Some of this space will likely replace existing space and therefore will not be a net addition to existing stock.\n18. Institutional funds may include operating funds, endowments, tax-exempt bonds and other debt financing, indirect costs recovered from federal grants/contracts, and private donations.\n19. Some additional indirect federal funding may come through overhead on grants and/or contracts from the federal government. To the extent these funds are ultimately used for renovation or construction of facilities, they are reported as institutional funding because it is the institution that decides how they are spent.\n\n\f5-54 \n\nChapter 5. Academic Research and Development\n\n20. Discussion of cyberinfrastructure is limited to networking because the Survey of Science and Engineering Research Facilities addresses only computing and networking capacity for research and instructional activities rather than all facets of cyberinfrastructure.\n21. The \"bricks and mortar\" section of the Survey of Science and Engineering Research Facilities asks institutions to report on their research space only. The reported figures therefore do not include space used for other purposes such as instruction or administration. In the cyberinfrastructure section of the survey, however, respondents were asked to identify all of their cyberinfrastructure resources, regardless of whether these resources were used for research.\n22. There have been discussions of a possible merger of Abilene and National Lambda Rail.\n23. The academic doctoral S&E workforce includes those with a doctorate in an S&E field in the following positions: full and associate professors (referred to as \"senior faculty\"); assistant professors and instructors (referred to as \"junior faculty\"); postdocs; other full-time positions such as lecturers, adjunct faculty, research associates, and administrators; and part-time positions of all kinds. Academic employment is limited to those employed in 2-year or 4-year colleges or universities. Unless specifically noted, data on S&E doctorate holders refer to persons with an S&E doctorate from a U.S. institution, as surveyed biennially by NSF in the Survey of Doctorate Recipients. All numbers are estimates rounded to the nearest 100. The reader is cautioned that small estimates may be unreliable.\n24. It is impossible to establish causal connections among these developments with the data at hand.\n25. These data include only U.S.-trained postdocs. The number of postdocs with temporary visas and presumed nonU.S. doctorates increased greatly in the 1990s. For data on trends in U.S.- and foreign-trained postdocs in U.S. academic institutions, see the discussion of postdocs in chapter 2. For more information on employment aspects of postdoctoral appointments, see the discussion of postdocs in chapter 3.\n26. The inclusion or exclusion of those on temporary and permanent visas has little impact on the analysis (see figure 5-20).\n27. Both the number and share of Asian/Pacific Islander S&E doctorate recipients employed in academia are probably larger than is reported here because those who received S&E doctorates from universities outside the United States are not included in the analysis.\n28. A 1986 amendment to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (Public Law 90-202) prohibited mandatory retirement on the basis of age for almost all workers. Higher education institutions were granted an exemption through 1993 that allowed termination of employees with unlimited tenure who had reached age 70.\n29. This measure was constructed slightly differently in the 1980s and in the 1990s, starting in 1993, and is not strictly comparable across these periods. In the 1980s, the survey question asked the respondent to select the primary and sec-\n\nondary work activity from a list of activities. Beginning in 1993, respondents were asked on which activity they spent the most hours and on which they spent the second most hours. Therefore, the crossing over of the two trends between 1991 and 1993 could partly reflect a difference in methodology. However, the faster growth rate for researchers in both the 1973\u00ad91 and 1993\u00ad2006 periods means that changes in question wording cannot fully explain the observed trend. Because individuals may select both a primary and a secondary work activity, they can be counted in both groups.\n30. The data in this edition of Indicators do not include articles from journals in professional fields. Thus the article counts reported here for past years will be slightly lower than counts reported in previous editions. See sidebar, \"Bibliometric Data and Terminology.\"\n31. European Union (EU) data include all member states as of 2007 (see appendix table 5-33 for a list of member countries); previous editions of Indicators considered a smaller set. Thus the larger world share of S&E articles accounted for by the European Union is in no small part a result of the expanded EU membership. However, see the discussion of growth rates by region and country later in this section.\n32. The Asia-10 includes China (including Hong Kong), Japan, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, and Taiwan.\n33. Uzun (2006) describes 20 years of Turkish science and technology policies that underlie the expansion of its article output.\n34. Another use of these data, showing within-country/ within-region S&E article field distributions as an indicator of the region/country portfolio of S&E research, has been discussed in past editions of Indicators. Although countries and regions display somewhat different emphases in their research portfolios, these patterns are stable and change only slowly over time. See, for example, Science and Engineering Indicators 2006, figure 5-38 and appendix tables 5-44 and 5-45 (NSB 2006).\n35. The reader is reminded that the data on which these indicators are based give the nationality of the institutional addresses listed on the article. Authors are not associated with a particular institution and may be of any nationality. Therefore the discussion in this section is based on the nationality of the institutions, not authors themselves and, for practical purposes, makes no distinction between nationality of institutions and nationality of authors.\n36. Merton (1973, p. 409) points out the tension between the norms of priority and of allocating credit in science: \"Although the facts are far from conclusive, this continuing change in the social structure of research, as registered by publications, seems to make for a greater concern among scientists with the question of `how will my contribution be identified' in collaborative work than with the historically dominant pattern of wanting to ensure their priority over others in the field...It may be that institutionally induced concern with priority is becoming overshadowed by\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 5-55\n\nthe structurally induced concern with the allocation of credit among collaborators.\"\n37. In this section only, author names refer to counts of individually listed authors of articles, not institutional authors. Since authors may appear on more than one article per year, they may be counted more than once. However, because NSF does not analyze individual author names, the extent of such multiple counting is unknown.\n38. The coauthorship data discussed in this paragraph are restricted to coauthorship across the regions/countries identified in table 5-23; i.e., collaboration between or among countries of the European Union, for example, is ignored. Intraregional coauthorship is discussed in the following sections.\n39. Readers are reminded that each country participating in an international coauthorship receives one full count for the article; i.e., for an article coauthored by the United States and Canada, both the United States and Canada receive a count of one. In the percentages discussed in this paragraph, the numerators for the country pairs are the same. The denominators vary, accounting for the different rates of coauthorship.\n40. Readers are reminded that the number of coauthored articles between any pair of countries is the same; each country is counted once per article in these data. However, countries other than the pairs discussed here may also appear on the article.\n41. Identification of the sector of the non-U.S. institution is not possible with the current data set.\n42. Readers are reminded that coauthors from different departments in an institution are coded as different institutions.\n43. See note 42. 44. This chapter uses the convention of a 3-year citation window with a 2-year lag, e.g., 2005 citation rates are from references in articles in the 2005 tape year to articles on the 2001, 2002, and 2003 tapes of the Thomson Scientific Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index databases. Analysis of the citation data shows that, in general, the 2-year citing lag captures the 3 peak cited years for most fields, with the following exceptions: in astronomy and physics the peak cited years are generally captured with a 1-year lag, and in computer sciences, psychology, and social sciences with a 3-year lag. 45. Percentiles are specified percentages below which the remainder of the articles falls, for example, the 99th percentile identifies the number of citations 99% of the articles failed to receive. Across all fields of science, 99% of articles failed to receive at least 21 citations. Matching numbers of citations with a citation percentile is not precise because all articles with a specified number of citations must be counted the same. Therefore, the citation percentiles discussed in this section and used in appendix table 5-38 have all been conservatively counted, and the identified percentile is in every case higher than specified, i.e., the 99th percentile is always >99%, the 95th percentile is always >95%, etc. Actual citations/percentiles per field vary widely because counts\n\nwere cut off to remain in the identified percentile. Using this method of counting, for example, the 75th percentile for engineering contained articles with two citations, whereas the 75th percentile for biological sciences contained articles with 5\u00ad8 citations.\n46. This pattern holds for even lower citation percentiles (e.g., the 95th or 90th).\n47. The previous edition of Indicators discussed various factors that may have contributed to the rise in university patenting, including federal statutes and court decisions (see NSB 2006, p 5-51 through 5-53).\n48. For an overview of these developments in the 20th century, see Mowery (2002).\n49. It is unclear whether the recent downturn in patents granted to universities/colleges is a result of changes in processing at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). For example, in its Performance and Accountability Report Fiscal Year 2006, USPTO reported an increase in overall applications from 2002 to 2006; a decrease in \"allowed\" patent applications; and an increase in average processing time from 24 to 31 months (USPTO 2006).\n50. The institutions listed in appendix table 5-40 have been reported consistently by USPTO since 1982. Nevertheless some imprecision is present in the data. Several university systems are counted as one institution, medical schools may be counted with their home institution, and universities are credited for patents only if they are the first-name assignee on a patent; other assignees are not counted. Universities also vary in how they assign patents, e.g., to boards of regents, individual campuses, or entities with or without affiliation with the university.\nGlossary\nAbilene: A high-performance network dedicated to research led by a consortium of universities, governments, and private industry; often called Internet2.\nAcademic doctoral S&E workforce: Includes those with a U.S. doctorate in an S&E field employed in 2- or 4-year colleges or universities in the following positions: full and associate professors (referred to as \"senior faculty\"); assistant professors and instructors (referred to as \"junior faculty\"); postdocs; other full-time positions such as lecturers, adjunct faculty, research associates, and administrators; and part-time positions of all kinds.\nAcademic institution: In the \"Financial Resources for Academic R&D\" section of this chapter, an academic institution is generally defined as an institution that has a doctoral program in science or engineering, is a historically black college or university that expends any amount of separately budgeted R&D in S&E, or is some other institution that spends at least $150,000 for separately budgeted R&D in S&E. Elsewhere in the chapter, this term encompasses any accredited institution of higher education.\n\n\f5-56 \n\nChapter 5.

Each FFRDC is administered either by an industrial firm, a university, or a nonprofit institution.\nFractional counting: A method of counting articles based on authorship attribution. Fractional counting divides the credit for an article with authors from more than one institution or country among the collaborating institutions or countries, based on the proportion of their participating departments or institutions. This method is generally used for article and citation counts.\nIndex of highly cited articles: A country's share of the world's top 1% of cited articles divided by its world share of articles during a given period.\nIndex of international collaboration: A country's rate of collaboration with another country divided by the other country's rate of international coauthorship.\nInstitutional author: Designation of authorship according to the author's institutional affiliation at the time of publication. Institutional authorship is used to determine the number of institutional authors an article has for purposes of article counts. Multiple authors from the same department of an institution are considered as one institutional author. See fractional counting and whole counting.\nNational Lambda Rail: A national fiber optic infrastructure supporting multiple networks for the research community.\nNet assignable square feet (NASF): Unit for measuring research space.

The United States has generally outperformed the European Union (EU) and Japan on these measures during the past two decades.\n China and India show higher productivity growth and per capita income growth than exhibited by the United States and other advanced economies. Despite these rapid gains, the absolute levels of productivity and per capita income remain far lower for China and India.\nU.S. Technology in the Global Marketplace\nThe United States has a leading position in the marketoriented knowledge-intensive service industries that are key contributors to economic growth around the world.\n Market-oriented knowledge-intensive services--business, financial, and communications--are driving growth in the service sector, which now accounts for nearly 70% of global economic activity. Market-oriented knowledge-intensive services generated $12 trillion in gross revenues (sales) in 2005 and grew almost twice as fast as other services between 1986 and 2005.\n The United States is the leading provider of marketoriented knowledge-intensive services, responsible for about 40% of world revenues on a value-added basis (gross revenue sales minus the purchase of domestic and imported supplies and inputs from other industries) over the past decade. The U.S. world share of value added exceeds world share of both the EU and Asia in all three industries.\n Asia, ranked third compared with the United States and the EU, has shown a steady rise in its world value-added share over the past two decades. China and India are leading Asia's increase, primarily in communications.\nHigh-technology manufacturing industries are key contributors to global manufacturing sector growth.\n Over the past 20 years, the rate of growth in world gross revenue in high-technology manufacturing industries was double that of other manufacturing industries. Asia has the largest high-technology manufacturing industry\n\nsector, followed by the United States and the EU, which ranks a distant third.\n The United States has the single largest value-added world share (35% in 2005) of any country in high-technology manufacturing industries. It is ranked first in three of the five high-technology industries (scientific instruments, aerospace, and pharmaceuticals) and is ranked second in the other two (communications equipment and office machinery and computers).\n China has made remarkable progress: its world share of high-technology manufacturing value added has more than quadrupled during the past decade. Estimates for 2005 show China accounting for 16% of world value added, making it the third-ranked country globally, just shy of Japan, whose world share in these industries fell sharply from 30% in 1989 to an estimated 16% in 2005.\n U.S. manufacturing has become more technology intensive, with the high-technology share of manufacturing industries increasing from 14% in 1990 to 24% in 2005. The high-technology share of China and India's manufacturing industries has also increased, suggesting that manufacturing output in lower-wage countries is also shifting toward technology-intensive goods.\nU.S. Trade Balance in High-Technology Manufacturing and Technology Products\nThe U.S. trade balance in high-technology manufacturing industries and advanced products has declined.\n The U.S. world market share of exports by high-technology industries dropped from about 20% in the early 1990s to 12% in 2005, primarily because of losses in export share by U.S. industries producing communications equipment and office machinery and computers.\n The trend for China has been quite different. China's share has grown rapidly; its world market share of hightechnology industry exports has more than doubled, from 8% in 1999 to an estimated 19% in 2005. Exports by China's high-technology industries surpassed those of Japan in 2001, the EU (excluding intra-EU exports) in 2002, and the United States in 2003. China has become the world's largest exporter.\n The reduction of U.S. industry's world export share has coincided with the decline in the U.S. trade balance in high-technology manufacturing industries that began in the late 1990s.\n The historically strong U.S. trade balance in advanced technology products exhibited a similar reduction, shifting from surplus to deficit starting in 2002. The overall U.S. trade deficit is largely driven by U.S. trade with Asian countries, especially China and Malaysia.\n\n\f6-6 \n\nChapter 6. Industry, Technology, and the Global Marketplace\n\nU.S. Royalties and Fees Generated From Intellectual Property\nThe United States continues to be a net exporter of intellectual property, primarily in manufacturing technology know-how and licensing of computer software.\n U.S. companies received $33 billion in net revenues generated by intellectual property from affiliated and unaffiliated foreign companies in 2005.\n The United States ran surpluses in manufacturing knowhow and licensing of computer software with unaffiliated companies, largely driven by trade with Asia, the largest purchaser of U.S. intellectual property in these areas.\nNew High-Technology Exporters\nIndicators that may be relevant to long-term hightechnology export potential show that China is the highest ranked among the six large developing economies examined.\n China is the highest ranked high-technology exporter of the six large developing economies (the other economies are India, Russia, Mexico, Brazil, and Indonesia) according to its composite score in 2007. China was ranked fourth a decade ago, then moved to second in 1999 and first in 2002, overtaking India, the previous leader.\n Russia is ranked third of the larger developing economies in 2007, although this ranking has fluctuated over the last decade. Mexico, ranked fourth, improved its position compared with past cycles. Brazil, ranked fifth, continued a decade-long decline in its ranking.\nS&E Publications in Peer-Reviewed Journals\nU.S. S&E publications in peer-reviewed journals with at least one author from private industry declined in both absolute and relative terms between 1988 and 2005 (a period during which intensified, global competition emerged), and the share of such publications appearing in basic research journals has also declined during this period.\n Industry's share of overall U.S. S&E article output declined from just below 9% to about 6% between 1988 and 2005.\n After peaking at 26% in 1995, the percentage of S&E articles with an industrial author published in basic research journals declined to 22% by 2005.\n\nGlobal Trends in Patenting\nThe United States continues to be the leading source of newly patented inventions compared with the EU and Asia. Asia's patenting activity is growing rapidly, however, especially in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.\n Inventors residing in the United States accounted for 53% of U.S. patent applications in 2005. Asia, the second-ranked source of U.S. patent applications, more than doubled its share from 13% two decades ago to 29% in 2005, led by growth from Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. U.S. patent applications from China and India are also growing, although from a low level.\n U.S. inventors are also the leading source of economically valuable patents known as triadic patents. (Triadic patents include only those inventions for which patent protection is sought in all three major world markets: the United States, Europe, and Japan.)\n In 2005, the U.S. share of triadic patents was estimated at 37%, followed by the EU (30%) and Asia (28%). Asia's share of these more important, economically valuable patents has been flat, unlike its rising share of U.S. patent applications.\n U.S. inventors are the leading source of U.S. patents granted in two key technology areas: (1) information and communications technology (ICT) and (2) biotechnology. Asia is ranked second as a source of U.S. patent grants in ICT and third in biotechnology, and the EU is ranked third as a source in ICT and second in biotechnology.\nU.S. High-Technology Small Businesses\nHigh-technology small businesses are a key sector for developing, adopting, and diffusing new technologies in the U.S. economy. Two types of financing, angel and venture capital, are critical for the formation and growth of hightechnology small businesses.\n High-technology small businesses employed 5 million workers in 2004, one-third of the total high-technology labor force. Service industries account for two-thirds of these workers, and manufacturing employs most of the remainder (31%).\n Angel investment plays an important role in the formation of high-technology companies. Angel investors financed 51,000 firms with $26 billion in 2006, an 11% increase compared with 2005. The top three technology areas receiving angel investment in 2006 were healthcare and medical devices, biotechnology, and computer software.\n Venture capital plays a key role in financing young hightechnology firms that are expanding. Venture capitalists financed nearly 3,000 firms with $26 billion in 2006, 14% higher than 2005. Technology areas that received the largest share of venture capital investment were computer software (20%), biotechnology (18%), and communications (16%).\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 6-7\n\nIntroduction\nChapter Overview\nThis chapter focuses on industry's vital role in the nation's science and technology (S&T) enterprise and how the national S&T enterprise develops, uses, and commercializes S&T investments by industry, academia, and government.1 Various indicators that track U.S. industry's national activity and standing in the international marketplace for technology products and services and technology development are discussed. Using public and private data sources, U.S. industry's technology activities are compared with those of other major regional economies, particularly the European Union (EU) and Asia.2\nPast assessments showed the United States to be a leader in many technology areas. Science and Engineering Indicators 2006 showed that advancements in information technologies (computers and communications products and services) drove the rising trends in new technology development and dominated technical exchanges between the United States and its trading partners. The chapter will examine whether the United States continues to be a leader in technology products and services and assess the competitiveness of the United States in the global economy.\nChapter Organization\nThis chapter leads off with a new section about how several key economic indicators that provide some perspective on trends in U.S. competitiveness compare with those of Europe, Japan, and the emerging economies of China and India. The chapter then examines the U.S. position in the global marketplace within the service and manufacturing industries, focusing on industries that have a particularly strong linkage to S&T. Because the service sector has become a key driver of global economic activity, considerable discussion is devoted to the U.S. global position in these industries.\nFollowing this discussion, trends in the U.S. global position in production and trade of high-, medium-, and lowtechnology industries are examined and compared with trends in the EU and Asia. The U.S. trade position in advanced technology goods and intellectual property is also discussed. The chapter next presents indicators that may be useful for assessing the potential for countries to become more important exporters of high-technology products. For the first time, the chapter looks at trends in publishing output, as measured by articles by U.S. industry authors in peerreviewed journals, to examine changes in one measure of the role of industry in the performance of research. This discussion is followed by analysis of U.S. inventiveness trends using data on U.S., European, and triadic patents. Trends in patenting by U.S. inventors are compared with those by European and Asian inventors, focusing on trends of two technologies: biotechnology and information and communi-\n\ncations technology (ICT). Finally, the chapter looks at trends in high-technology-oriented U.S. small businesses that can have a particularly strong relationship to entrepreneurship in S&T. Data are presented on small businesses by technology area, employment, formation, and sources of financing.\nKey Economic Indicators of U.S. Competitiveness\nS&E and the technological innovations that emerge from R&D activities enable high-wage nations such as the United States to compete in today's highly competitive global marketplace. Many of the innovative new products found around the world, many of the inventions and manufacturing process innovations that improve worker productivity, and many of the transformative innovations that create not just new companies but new industries can be traced back to earlier national investments in S&E and R&D. Business application and marketing of these innovations make large contributions to national economic growth and support U.S. economic competitiveness in the marketplace at home and abroad (Okubo et al. 2006).3\nAn international standard used to judge a nation's competitiveness rests on the ability of its industries to produce goods that sell in the marketplace while simultaneously maintaining, if not improving, the standard of living for its citizens (OECD 1996). Three macroeconomic indicators that help to measure this standard of national competitiveness are economic growth, standard of living, and productivity. Trends in these indicators for the United States are presented alongside those for the EU and Japan, which also rely on R&D and other S&E investments to support national competitiveness.\nTrends in National Economic Growth, Standard of Living, and Labor Productivity\nNational Economic Growth The U.S. economy, the largest of any nation, continues to\nbe one of the fastest growing compared with other large, advanced economies (figure 6-1; appendix table 6-1). With the expansion of country membership, the EU has become an economic area slightly larger than the United States, $13.0 trillion versus $12.4 trillion on a purchasing power parity basis in 2005. (Purchasing power parity (PPP) is the exchange rate required to purchase an equivalent market basket of goods.) Both economies measured more than three times larger than that of Japan. Breaking down the past 15 years into three 5-year periods, the U.S. economy grew faster than either the EU or Japan during each of the three periods. U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average annual rate of 3.2% from 1991 to 1995, by 4.2% from 1996 to 2000, and by 2.8% from 2001 to 2005 (figure 6-1). During 2005, the most recent year for which these internationally comparable data are available, U.S. GDP grew by 3.2%.\n\n\f6-8 \n\nChapter 6.

See appendix table 6-1.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nStandard of Living Faster growth of the U.S. economy, however, is due par-\ntially to more rapid population growth in the United States compared with the other two economies. Normalizing the value of all national economic activity (GDP) for population size provides a widely recognized measure of the national standard of living. During the same 15-year period discussed previously (1991\u00ad2005), U.S. GDP per capita increased each year except 2001, rising from $31,312 (inflation adjusted to PPP 2005 dollars) in 1991 to $41,824 in 2005 (figure 6-2; appendix table 6-1). GDP per capita in the EU was generally 25%\u00ad30% lower (in inflation adjusted to PPP dollars) than U.S. GDP per capita but followed a similar upward trend; 1993 was the EU's single year of declining GDP per capita. By comparison, during the same time period, Japan's standard of living grew much more slowly, experiencing several years of decline.4\nProductivity of the United States and Other Advanced Economies\nThe high and rising standard of living enjoyed by the three advanced economies, the United States, the EU, and Japan, is influenced by the efficiency with which their resources (labor and capital) are employed, measured by labor or multifactor productivity. Labor and multifactor productivity are the change in GDP per unit of labor and combined unit of labor and capital, respectively.\n\nFigure 6-2 GDP per capita for United States, EU, and Japan: 1989\u00ad2005\n2002 U.S. PPP dollars (thousands)\n50\n\n40\n30 Japan\n20\n\nUnited States EU\n\n10\n\n0 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005\nEU = European Union; GDP = gross domestic product; PPP = purchasing power parity\nNOTES: GDP converted to U.S. dollars using 2002 PPPs at 2005 price level.

See appendix table 6-1.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nProcess innovations and the application of new capital equipment in the manufacturing process help to raise labor's productivity, allowing high-wage nations such as the United States to compete successfully in the global marketplace.\nLabor productivity of the United States has exceeded that of the EU and Japan for at least several decades (figure 6-3; appendix table 6-2). Growth in U.S. productivity lagged behind that of the EU and Japan in the early 1990s, but rebounded in the latter half of the 1990s. U.S. productivity growth during this period has been attributed to the widespread diffusion of information technology (IT) throughout the economy.5 The EU's and Japan's growth rates in productivity fell during the 1995\u00ad2000 period, and the EU's rate continued to decline from 2000 to 2005. As a result, the gaps between the levels of labor productivity of the United States, the EU, and Japan have widened over the past decade.\nInternational Comparisons of Labor Compensation Productivity growth can directly affect the level and\ngrowth of wages in a country. Existing data allow only limited international comparison. An international indicator of relative wages across economies is compensation costs (direct wages and benefits) for production workers in manufacturing, which measure whether gains in productivity and per capita GDP have been accompanied by an increase in labor compensation. These compensation data do not fully take into account cost-of-living differences across countries, however.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 6-9\n\nFigure 6-3 GDP per hour worked for United States, EU, and Japan: 1989\u00ad2005\n2002 U.S. PPP dollars 50\nUnited States 40\nEU 30\nJapan\n20\n10\n0 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005\nEU = European Union; GDP = gross domestic product; PPP = purchasing power parity NOTES: GDP converted to U.S. dollars using 2002 PPPs at 2005 price level.

See appendix table 6-2.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\nU.S. workers have enjoyed steady gains in compensation during the past decade and a half, coinciding with gains in U.S. productivity (figure 6-4; appendix table 6-3). The trend in compensation in the EU and Japan has been more volatile (in part reflecting fluctuations in exchange rates), but their levels are comparable to that of the United States. EU production workers generally fared better during this period than production workers in the United States and Japan, although this measurement does not adjust for differences in PPP within the three economies.\nData on wages and benefits for U.S. workers employed in broad sectors of the economy show that productivity growth has been accompanied by an increase in real wages and benefits paid to U.S. workers in private industry (table 6-1). Between 1989 and 2005, compensation for U.S. workers in the goods sector (manufacturing, construction, mining, and utilities) and the services sector (financial, retail, communications, and business) grew at 0.7% on an average annual basis adjusted for inflation. Compensation grew faster for white collar workers compared with blue collar workers in both sectors (table 6-1).\nJudging from the measures discussed above, the United States continues to be highly competitive in the global marketplace. The U.S. economy continues to expand, finding demand for its products and services while maintaining relatively high compensation for U.S. workers and rising GDP per capita for its citizens.\n\nFigure 6-4 Hourly compensation costs for manufacturing production workers for United States, EU-15, and Japan: 1989\u00ad2005\nCurrent U.S. dollars\n30\n\n20 EU-15\n10\n\nJapan United States\n\n0 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005\nEU = European Union\nNOTES: EU-15 includes member countries before enlargement in September 2004.

Industry, Technology, and the Global Marketplace\n\nRising Competitiveness of China and India\nEconomic growth in China and India has been rapid in recent years, and these two countries have increased their global market share, trade, and investment in many industries. Productivity and per capita income growth of these two countries, particularly China, appear to have been much more rapid in recent years than that of the United States and other advanced economies (table 6-2). Despite these apparently rapid gains, their absolute level of productivity and per capita income remain far lower than that of industrialized countries (see sidebar, \"Measuring National Competitiveness of China and India\").\nU.S. Technology in the Global Marketplace\nNational investments in S&E, technological innovations developed from related activities, and R&D performed in all sectors of the economy, almost certainly play an important role in supporting U.S. competitiveness. This section of the chapter takes a closer look at both the industries that perform the bulk of R&D in the United States and recent trends of high-technology and lower-technology industry activity in the global marketplace.\nPolicies in many countries reflect a belief that a symbiotic relationship exists between investment in S&T and success in the marketplace: S&T supports industry's competitiveness in international trade, and commercial success in the global marketplace provides the resources needed to support new S&T. Consequently, a nation's economic health is a performance measure for the national investment in R&D and S&T.\nAt least to some degree, S&T is important for growth and competitiveness of all industries. However, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has identified 10 industries in services and manufacturing that have a particularly strong linkage to S&T:\n\n Knowledge-intensive service industries. Communications services, financial services, business services (including computer software development), education services, and health services (OECD 2001).6 These five service industries incorporate sciences, engineering, and technology in either their services or the delivery of their services. Knowledge-intensive service industries are further divided into industries that are either largely market driven and known as market oriented (communications, financial, and business services) or are largely provided by the public sector (education and health services) (see sidebar, \"U.S. Global Market Position in Education and Health Services\").\n High-technology manufacturing industries. Aerospace, pharmaceuticals, computers and office machinery, communications equipment, and scientific (medical, precision, and optical) instruments.7 These five science-based industries manufacture products while spending a relatively high proportion of their revenues on R&D.\nThis section presents revenue and trade data for the marketoriented knowledge-intensive services and high-technology manufacturing industries in 70 countries8 (see sidebar, \"Comparison of Data Classification Systems Used\"). S&T is not exclusive to knowledge-intensive services and high-technology manufacturing; therefore this section will also examine the U.S. market position in other services and industries.\nA critical issue is how to credit companies' output to industries and countries, given that production has become more global and dispersed across companies and industries. Companies increasingly use subsidiaries or contract other companies in a variety of industries located within and across national borders to help create their output.\nTwo measures are used in this chapter: gross revenue and value-added revenue, referred to as value added. Gross revenue is the value of the industry's shipments or services, equivalent to the industry's sales, including domestic and imported supplies and inputs from other industries. Gross revenue is an\n\nTable 6-2 Selected economic and productivity indicators for United States, China, and India: 1995\u00ad2004\n\nProductivity growth (% average annual change)\n\nGDP (US$)\n\nCountry\n\n1995\u00ad2004\n\n1995\u00ad2000\n\n2000\u00ad04\n\nPer employee 2004 Per capita 2004 2004\n\nUnited States..............\n\n2.0\n\n2.3\n\n1.7\n\nChina ..........................\n\n5.5\n\n3.1\n\n8.6\n\nIndia ............................\n\n4.2\n\n4.0\n\n4.4\n\n100\n\n100\n\n100\n\n13\n\n16\n\n71\n\n10\n\n8\n\n28\n\nGDP = gross domestic product\n\nNOTES: Productivity growth measured on basis of GDP per employee.

In the case of China, some scholars contend that official estimates of China's GDP, GDP per capita, and productivity growth have been overstated because of the difficulty and inaccuracy of estimating economic output within China's industry and service sectors.\nOfficial estimates by the Chinese government and most international organizations suggest that labor productivity growth rates, as measured by real GDP per person employed, increased by an average of 7.3% between 1995 and 2004. Although a more conservative estimate by the Groningen Growth and Development Centre (GGDC) and The Conference Board (TCB) indicates an average productivity growth rate of 5.6% during the same period, this estimate also finds faster growth from 2000 to 2004 (8.6%) than official sources (7.6%) (table 6-2).\n\nGGDC and TCB estimate that India's productivity growth averaged 4.4% during this period, as measured by GDP per employee (table 6-2). This is slower than China's growth, but significantly faster than the United States or other industrialized economies.\nDespite uncertainties over the size of China's economy and its level of productivity, GGDC and TCB estimate that China's GDP and productivity are between 4 to 5 times higher on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis than would be determined using China's official exchange rate. A PPP adjustment implies that China and India's GDP levels are about 71% and 28%, respectively, of the U.S. GDP level (table 6-2). China's and India's levels of productivity, however, remain far below that of the United States, estimated to be 13% and 10%, respectively, of U.S. 2004 levels.\n\nU.S. Global Market Position in Education and Health Services\n\nMany nations' governments serve as the primary provider of education and health services. The size and distribution of each country's population profoundly affect delivery of these services. For these reasons, global comparisons based on market-generated revenues are less meaningful for education and health services than for other service industries.\nEducation services include governmental and private educational institutions of all types that offer primary, secondary, and university education, as well as technical, vocational, and commercial schools. In 2005, fees (tuition) and income from education- and service-related operations amounted to $1.3 trillion in world value-added revenue (table 6-3; appendix tables 6-4 and 6-5). The U.S. education sector generated the most value added by far (41% in 2005), with the EU second (29%) and Asia third (14%). Asia's world share of education services revenues increased by 3 percentage points during the past decade, led by China and India. China's world share doubled from 3% to 6%, and India's share increased from 0.8% to 1.2%, coinciding with the rapid expansion in these countries of university-level enrollment and graduation of students in S&E and other fields. (See Chapter 2, section \"Global Higher Education in S&E\" for discussion about trends in S&E higher education in Asia and other countries.)\nThe United States, with arguably the least government involvement, has the largest health-service industry in the world, followed by the EU and Asia (table 6-3). In 2005, the U.S. health-service industry accounted for 38% of the $1.7 trillion in world revenue (value added) of the health-\n\ncare sector, whereas the EU share was 29% and Asia's share was 19%.\n\nTable 6-3 Value-added revenue and world share for selected service industries, by selected regions/countries: 1996, 2001, and 2005\n(Percent)\n\nIndustry and region/country\n\n1996 2001 2005\n\nEducation All regions/countries (2000 constant $trillion).................. 1.07 1.18 1.28 United States ..................... 40.0 39.8 40.6 EU....................................... 32.7 31.5 29.0 Asia .................................... 11.3 12.6 14.4\nHealth All regions/countries (2000 constant $trillion).................. 1.29 1.55 1.71 United States ..................... 40.5 36.5 38.4 EU....................................... 32.9 30.5 28.9 Asia .................................... 12.8 20.3 19.4\n\nEU = European Union\n\nNOTES: Value-added revenue excludes purchases of domestic and imported materials and supplies.

These measure activity in high-technology manufacturing and knowledge-intensive service industries, measure U.S. trade in advanced technology products, and track both the patenting of new inventions and trends in venture capital investments.

It is a more suitable indicator of an industry's direct contribution to the national economy because it excludes inputs from other industries and countries. In addition, value added adjusts for differences in the mix of labor, capital, and inputs used by an industry, which can vary across countries. The crediting of value-added output to regions or countries is imperfect, however, because a country receives credit on\n\nthe basis of where the company reported the activity, which may be different from where the activity occurred.\nTrade data are available for high-technology manufacturing industries but not market-oriented service industries. Trade data are on a gross-revenue basis, and country shares of world trade volume encompass inputs purchased from other industries and countries.\nAnother issue is classifying industries within a manufacturing or service category. In the data used here, companies are assigned to a single manufacturing or service industry on the basis of the largest share of the company's shipment of goods or delivery of services. This method of categorizing\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 6-13\n\ncompany activity is imperfect, because an industry classified as manufacturing may include services, and a company classified as being within a service industry may include manufacturing or directly serve a manufacturing company. Furthermore, the single industry classification is not a good measure for companies that have diversified activities in many categories of industries.\nFigure 6-5 Services and goods shares of global economic activity: 1980\u00ad2003\nPercent 80\n60 Services\n40 Goods\n20\n0 1980 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003\nNOTES: Services include wholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants, transportation, finance, real estate, education, health, and government.

The World Bank estimates that services constituted 68% of global economic activity in 2003 compared with a 56% share in 1980. Market-oriented knowledge-intensive services constitute a large and growing part of the service sector's output.9 The worldwide gross revenue generated by market-oriented knowledge-intensive services more than doubled from $4.5 trillion in 1986 to $11.5 trillion in 2005, on a constant dollar basis (table 6-4).10 Market-oriented knowledge-intensive service revenues grew at an average annual inflation-adjusted rate of 4.8% compared with 2.7% by other services during this 20-year period (table 6-4). In 1986, gross revenues of market-oriented knowledge-intensive services comprised 22% of all services; by 2005, their share had increased to 30%.\nThe United States, the EU, and Asia are the leading providers of market-oriented knowledge-intensive services, comprising nearly 90% of global value-added activity in 2005. The United States has the largest share among the three, responsible for about 40% of world service revenues on a value-added basis, a share that has remained constant for the past decade (figure 6-6; appendix tables 6-4 and 6-5). The EU is the next leading provider of high-technology services. Its share of world revenues, however, slipped from 26% in the mid-1990s to 25% in 2005 because of declines in service industry activity in Germany and Italy.\nThe third-leading provider of market-oriented knowledgeintensive services, Asia, shows a steady rise in world share over the past two decades (figure 6-6; appendix tables 6-4 and 6-5).11 Over the past 10 years, Asia's world share rose by 2 percentage points to 22%. China, and to a lesser degree India, have driven the increase in Asia's world share.

Japan's revenues grew slower than the average rate for all of Asia, and its share of world revenues fell from 14.1% to 12.6% during this period.\nU.S. Global Position in Market-Oriented Knowledge-Intensive Service Industries\nThe United States holds the leading position in all three industries that comprise market-oriented knowledge-intensive services (business, communications, and financial services) (table 6-5; appendix tables 6-4 and 6-5). The U.S. market is large and mostly open, which benefits U.S. industries in the global market in two important ways. First, supplying a domestic market with many consumers offers U.S. producers scale effects resulting from potentially large rewards for new ideas and innovations. Second, the relative openness of the U.S. market to foreign competitors in these three industries pressures U.S. producers to be innovative to maintain domestic market share.\n\nTable 6-5\nGlobal value-added revenue of market-oriented knowledge-intensive service industries and world share of selected regions: 1996 and 2005\n\nIndustry and region/country\n\n1996\n\n2005\n\nBusiness\n\nGlobal revenue (2000 constant\n\n$trillions) ...................................\n\n2.38\n\n3.38\n\nWorld share (%)\n\nUnited States .........................\n\n43.3\n\n42.6\n\nEU ...........................................\n\n28.2\n\n29.3\n\nAsia ........................................\n\n17.1\n\n16.9\n\nFinancial\n\nGlobal revenue (2000 constant\n\n$trillions) ...................................\n\n1.61\n\n2.28\n\nWorld share (%)\n\nUnited States .........................\n\n36.9\n\n37.6\n\nEU ...........................................\n\n23.3\n\n19.0\n\nAsia ........................................\n\n27.2\n\n29.9\n\nCommunications\n\nGlobal revenue (2000 constant\n\n$trillions) ...................................\n\n0.59\n\n1.11\n\nWorld share (%)\n\nUnited States .........................\n\n42.1\n\n38.7\n\nEU ...........................................\n\n22.7\n\n22.2\n\nAsia ........................................\n\n16.2\n\n22.6\n\nEU = European Union\n\nNOTES: Knowledge-intensive services classified by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and consist of business, financial, communications, education, and health services.

Asia is ranked second\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 6-15\n\nin financial services, with a world share of 30% in 2005, 3 percentage points higher than its 1996 level. China's world share increased from 4% in 1996 to 8% in 2005. The EU ranked third in financial services, with a 19% share of world financial services industry revenues in 2005. Its share has declined by 4 percentage points over the past decade, primarily driven by declining revenues in industries within Germany and Italy.\nCommunications Services The smallest of the knowledge-intensive industries ($1.1\ntrillion in 2005), communications services, is arguably the most technology driven. Provision of local and national communications services, however, is not fully open and competitive in many markets. In the United States, competition and new technologies have led to reductions in prices to consumers. In this industry, U.S. companies again hold a lead position, generating revenues equal to 39% of world value-added revenues in 2005 (figure 6-7; appendix tables 6-4 and 6-5). The U.S. world share in 2005, however, was 3 percentage points less than its share a decade ago. From 1996 to 2005, Asia's world market share jumped 6 percentage points, overtaking the EU in 2005 with a level of 23%. China and India drove Asia's ascent, with their communications industries averaging close to an annual average growth rate of 20% over the last decade. China and India's world shares more than doubled during this period, reaching 7% and 2%, respectively, in 2005. Japan's world share remained unchanged at 9%.\n\nFigure 6-7 Global value-added revenue of communication services and world share of selected regions: 1989\u00ad2005\n\nWorld share (%) (lines) 50\nUnited States\n40\n\nRevenue (constant 2000 $billions) (bars) 1.2\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n30\n\nEU\n\n0.6\n\n20 Other 0.4\n\n10\n\nAsia\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005\n\nEU = European Union\nNOTES: Revenue on value-added basis, which excludes purchased domestic and imported materials and inputs.

These four industries incorporate S&T in their services or delivery of their services, but at a lower intensity compared with knowledge-intensive services. For example, inventory control incorporating IT technology has enabled the retail sector to cut costs and more precisely tailor and match inventory to meet customer demand.\nThe United States is leading in value added on a constant dollar basis within three of these four service industries: wholesale and retail, restaurant and hotel, and real estate (figure 6-8; appendix tables 6-6 and 6-7). The U.S. world market share has remained relatively constant during the past decade, although its position has changed in some industries. In the largest of these, wholesale and retail ($4.3 trillion in value added in 2005), the U.S. world share rose from 30% in 1996 to 35% in 2005, coinciding with the rapid rise of Wal-Mart and other retailers that compete aggressively on price and use sophisticated technology to manage their inventories.\n\nFigure 6-8 Global value-added revenue and world share of selected service industries, by selected regions/ countries: 2005\n\nPercent\n\n40\n\nU.S.\n\nEU\n\nAsia\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0 Wholesale/ retail trade $4.3 trillion\n\nReal estate Transportation/ Restaurants/\n\n$3.4 trillion\n\nstorage\n\nhotels\n\n$1.4 trillion $0.8 trillion\n\nEU = European Union\nNOTES: Global revenue in 2005 of each sector shown in 2000 constant dollars.

Industry, Technology, and the Global Marketplace\n\nImportance of High-Technology Industries to Manufacturing\nHigh-technology industries are driving growth in manufacturing activity worldwide. Between 1986 and 2005, hightechnology manufacturing gross revenue rose from $1.1 trillion to $3.5 trillion in constant dollars (figure 6-9). Average annual growth during this 20-year period was 6%, more than double the rate for other manufacturing industries. In 2005, the high-technology share of all manufacturing output was 18% compared with 10% in 1986.\nHigh-technology industries spend a relatively high proportion of their revenues on R&D compared with other manufacturing industries (table 6-6). R&D can lead to innovation, and companies that innovate tend to gain market share, create new product markets, and use resources more productively (NRC, Hamburg Institute for Economic Research, Kiel Institute for World Economics 1996; Tassey 2002).12 High-technology industries also tend to develop high-value-added products, export more, and, on average, pay higher salaries than other manufacturing industries.13 Moreover, industrial R&D performed by high-technology industries benefits other commercial sectors by developing new products, machinery, and processes that increase productivity and expand business activity.\n\nFigure 6-9 Global high-technology manufacturing industry gross revenue and share of all manufacturing industries: 1986\u00ad2005\n\nRevenue (constant 2000 $trillions) (line)\n4\n\nShare all manufacturing (%) (bars)\n20\n\n3\n\n15\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n5\n\n0 1986\n\n0 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005\n\nNOTES: High-technology manufacturing industries classified by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and include aerospace, communications e uipment, office machinery and computers, pharmaceuticals, and scientific instruments.

U.S. high-technology manufacturers rank second, as measured by their share of world value added, compared with the EU and Asia (figure 6-10; appendix tables 6-8 and 6-9). After moving up sharply in the late 1990s, the U.S. share has remained essentially flat at 34%\u00ad35% since 2001. U.S. consumption of high-technology manufactured goods also exhibited a sharp increase in the late 1990s (see figure 6-11 in sidebar, \"Consumption of High-Technology Manufactured Goods\"). Asia has ranked first in high-technology manufacturing value added since 1987, with the exception of 2001. The United States, however, has the largest share of any country in high-technology industries since overtaking Japan in 1997.\nThe EU has a sizably smaller world share than the United States or Asia (figure 6-10; appendix tables 6-8 and 6-9), and its world share has fallen continuously from 25% in 1995 to 18% in 2005. Reduced manufacturing activity in four EU countries (Italy, the United Kingdom [UK], Germany, and Spain) led to the EU share's decline over the past 10 years.\nSeveral Asian countries, mainly China and Japan, have had dramatic shifts in their market positions during the past two decades (table 6-7; appendix tables 6-8 and 6-9):\n Japan's share of world value added peaked in 1989 at 29%, nearly doubling its level in the early 1980s before declining steeply in the late 1990s. In 2005, Japan's hightechnology manufacturers accounted for 16% of world value added. As a result of the decline in its world share, Japan's country ranking slipped from first to second.\n China's world share rose from 2% in the late 1980s to 4% by 1997, then accelerated sharply to reach 16% in 2005, just 0.1 percentage point below Japan's share. The fifthranked country by world share in 1998, China rose to third-ranked in 2005, overtaking the UK and Germany.\n South Korea's world share nearly doubled from 2% in 1993 to almost 4% in 2005. Its country ranking moved from 10th to 5th during this period, overtaking Italy, France, and the UK.\n India's world share, although doubling between 1989 and 2005, remained very small, at less than 0.5%.\nHigh-Technology Industries and Domestic Production\nIncreasingly, manufacturers in countries with high standards of living and labor costs have moved their manufacturing operations to locations with lower labor costs.

(Valueadded revenue equals gross revenue excluding purchases of domestic and foreign supplies and inputs.)\nIn the United States, high-technology industries created about 20% more value-added per dollar of gross revenue than other manufacturing industries (figure 6-12).14 Hightechnology industries also generally pay higher wages than other manufacturing industries.15 Recognition of these contributions has led to intense competition among nations and localities to create, attract, nurture, and retain high-technology industries.16\nDuring the 1990s, manufacturing output in the United States and other high-wage countries continued to shift into higher value-added, technology-intensive goods, often referred to as high-technology manufactures (figure 6-13). In\n\n1990, high-technology manufacturing accounted for about 14% of all U.S. manufacturing value added. Growth in demand for communications and computer equipment increased the high-technology share of U.S. manufacturing to 19% in 2000 and 24% in 2005. The EU also saw high-technology manufactures account for a growing share of its total domestic production, although to a lesser degree. In 1990, high technology accounted for 10% of EU manufacturing value added, but by 2005 this had risen to 14%.\nAsia's manufacturing production is also driven by hightechnology industries (figure 6-13). The high-technology share of Asia's total manufacturing value added increased from 16% in 1990 to 22% in 2005. Japan's share, however, remained flat between 2000 and 2005. China's high-technology share of its total manufacturing more than doubled from 11% in 1990 to 28% in 2005, exceeding the comparable figure for the United States. India's share grew modestly from 6% to 9% during this period.\n\n\f6-18 \n\nChapter 6.

See appendix tables 6-8 and 6-9.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nGlobal Competitiveness of Individual HighTechnology Industries\nThe global market for communications equipment is the largest of the high-technology markets, as measured by share of global value added, accounting for nearly half of the total output of high-technology industries in 2005 (table 6-9;\n\nappendix tables 6-10 and 11).17 Pharmaceuticals are the next largest segment, comprising 19%, followed by scientific instruments (14%), office machinery and computers (14%), and aerospace (8%).\nThe United States has a leading position, as measured by its world share of value added, in scientific instruments, aerospace, and pharmaceuticals compared with Asia and the EU. The United States is ranked second of the three economies in communications equipment and office machinery and computers (table 6-9; appendix tables 6-10 and 6-11). The large size and openness of the U.S. market that benefits U.S. service industries similarly benefits high-technology manufacturing industries. Additionally, the U.S. government influences the size and growth of the nation's hightechnology industries through 1) investments in industrial R&D purchases of new products, 2) laws regulating sales to foreign entities of certain products produced by each of the five high-technology industries, and 3) policies that create an enabling environment by promoting innovation, investment, and entrepreneurship.18\nCommunications equipment. In this industry, U.S. manufacturers reversed downward trends evident during the 1980s to grow and gain market share in the mid- to late 1990s, partly because of increased capital investment by U.S. businesses (see sidebar, \"U.S. IT Investment\"). The U.S. share of world communications equipment value added grew by more than 20 percentage points between 1995 and 2005 to reach 34% (figure 6-14; appendix tables 6-10 and 6-11). Asia's world share slipped by about 10 percentage points because of the rapid decline of Japan, which had been the world's leading supplier of communications equipment until 2000. Japan's share fell from 42% to 23% during this period. China's world share tripled, rising from 5% to 15%. The EU's world share decreased from 19% to 12%, led by losses by Italy and the UK.\n\nTable 6-7 World share of value-added revenue of high-technology manufacturing industries for selected Asian countries: Selected years, 1989\u00ad2005\n(Percent)\n\nRegion/country\n\n1989\n\n1993\n\n1997\n\n2000\n\n2003\n\n2005\n\nAsia ...................................................................................

A broad measure of domestic use is provided by adding domestic sales to imports and subtracting exports. Use so defined encompasses two different concepts: consumption of final goods and capital investment for further production (intermediate goods). Available data series do not permit examining these two concepts separately.\nDuring the past decade, use of high-technology goods has more than doubled after accounting for inflation, from $1.6 trillion to $3.5 trillion (table 6-8). The strong U.S. economy registered higher growth, more than tripling from 1995 to 2005, compared with below-average growth for the EU and almost no change for Japan. In China, use of high-technology manufactures rose ninefold, approaching the level of the EU.\nThe Chinese trend underscores the difficulty of teasing out final consumption from use as intermediate goods. The strong rise in the Chinese trend is considered by many observers to reflect the rising inflow of intermediate goods, often previously produced in China, from other Asian manufacturing centers into China for further assembly and ultimate export.\nPatterns of the world's use of high-technology manufactures have changed considerably over the past decade. Bearing in mind the difficulty of breaking these trends into final consumption versus investment, the U.S. share rose from 22% in 1995 to about 30% in 2000 and has largely stayed at that level (figure 6-11). The EU's share fell from 27% to 21% during the same decade (1995\u00ad2005), and Japan's declined by nearly half from 23% to 12%. China's share accelerated from 7% in 1999 to 20% in 2005.\n\nFigure 6-11 World share of apparent consumption of hightechnology manufacturing industries: 1995\u00ad2005\nPercent\n50\n\n40 Asia United States\n30 European Union\n\n20\nAll other countries 10\nChina\n\nJapan\n\n0 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005\nNOTES: Apparent consumption is domestic production and imports minus exports.

The trends in the office and computer machinery manufacturing industry were similar to those in communications equipment. The United States, which was the second-ranked country by its world value added in 1995 (13%), doubled its share over a decade, surpassing Japan in 2000, to become the largest country until 2003, when it was overtaken by China (figure 6-15; appendix tables 6-10 and 6-11). Japan, which had been the largest country producing computer and office machinery equipment for most of the past two decades, had a sharply lower value added share, from 45% in 1995 to 9% in 2005. China's progress, however, was remarkable; its share of world value added expanded from 2% in 1995 to 46% in 2005. This rapid rise resulted in China surpassing both Japan in 2002 and the U.S. in 2003 to become the largest producing country in this industry.\nPharmaceuticals. As a result of varying degrees of public financing and regulation of pharmaceuticals throughout the world, as well as differing national laws governing the distribution of foreign pharmaceuticals, market comparisons in this industry may be less meaningful. The United States, the EU, and Asia accounted for 90% of global value-added revenue in 2005 (table 6-9; appendix tables 6-10 and 6-11).

In Asia, Japan, China, and South Korea are the largest producers of pharmaceuticals (appendix tables 6-10 and 6-11). Although Japan still has the larger domestic industry, China's share has grown steadily while Japan's has generally declined. In 1995, domestic production by Japan's industry accounted for 21% of global\n\nvalue-added revenue, but by 2005 this proportion had fallen to 13%. In 2005, China's pharmaceutical industry accounted for an estimated 8% of global value-added revenue, quadruple its share in 1995. South Korea's share of global value added edged up from 2% to 3%, and India's share doubled from 1% to 2% during this period.\nScientific instruments. In 2001, the industry that produces scientific instruments (medical, precision, and optical instruments) was added to the group of high-technology industries, reflecting that industry's high level of R&D within advanced nations (table 6-6). The United States is the leading producer of scientific instruments, accounting for 40% of global revenue on a value-added basis in 2005 (table 6-9; appendix tables 6-10 and 6-11). The U.S. position has strengthened since 1995, as measured by world share, which rose 4 percentage points. Ranked second, the EU lost 3 percentage points in world share between 1995 and 2005, resulting from declines on the part of the UK, Italy, and Germany.\nIn Asia, Japan and China are the largest producers of scientific instruments. As in some other high-technology manufacturing industries, Japan's share of value-added global revenue in this industry is declining while China's share is increasing (appendix tables 6-10 and 6-11). In 1995, Japan's industry producing scientific instruments accounted for 15% of world value-added output; however, its share declined to about 11% in 2005. China's industry, which accounted for 2% of global value-added revenue in 1995, tripled to 6% in 2005.\nAerospace. The U.S. aerospace industry has long maintained a leading position in the global marketplace. The U.S. government is a major customer for the U.S. aerospace industry, contracting for military aircraft, missiles, and spacecraft. Since 1989, production for the U.S. government has accounted for approximately 40%\u00ad60% of total annual sales (AIA 2005). The U.S. aerospace industry position in the global marketplace is enhanced by this longstanding customersupplier relationship.\nIn recent years, however, the aerospace industry's manufacturing share has fallen more than any other U.S. high-technology industry. Since peaking at 73% of global value-added revenue in 1987, the U.S. share fell to 58% in 1999 and continued to decline to less than half of global value-added revenue in 2005 (table 6-9; appendix tables 6-10 and 6-11). European aerospace manufacturers, particularly within Germany and the UK, made gains during this time. By 2005, the EU accounted for 27% of world aerospace value-added revenue, up from 19% in 1985 (appendix tables 6-10 and 6-11).19 Asia's share of the global aerospace market reached 5% by the mid-1990s and then, accelerating sharply, grew to 16% in 2005, driven by gains in Japan and China. Japan's share of value-added global revenue rose from 3% in 1996 to almost 7% in 2005. China's aerospace industry grew just as rapidly, and exceeded 6% in 2005.\n\n\f6-22 \n\n&IGURE\n Global value-added revenue of communications equipment and world share of selected regions/ countries: 1995\u00ad2005\n\n7ORLDSHARE LINES \n\n2EVENUECONSTANTBILLIONS BARS \n\n\n\n\n\nAsia\n\n\n\nJapan \n\n 5NITED3TATES\n\n\n\n\n\n%5\n\n\n\nChina\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n\n%5%UROPEAN5NION\n./4%3#OMMUNICATIONSEQUIPMENTINCLUDESCOMMUNICATIONS\f RADIO\fANDTELEVISIONEQUIPMENT2EVENUEONVALUE\nADDEDBASIS\f WHICHEXCLUDESPURCHASESOFDOMESTICANDIMPORTEDMATERIALSAND INPUTS!SIAINCLUDES#HINA\f)NDIA\f)NDONESIA\f*APAN\f-ALAYSIA\f 0HILIPPINES\f3INGAPORE\f3OUTH+OREA\f4AIWAN\fAND4HAILAND#HINA INCLUDES(ONG+ONG%5EXCLUDES#YPRUS\f%STONIA\f,ATVIA\f,ITHUANIA\f ,UXEMBOURG\f-ALTA\fAND3LOVENIA\n3/52#%'LOBAL)NSIGHT\f)NC\f7ORLD)NDUSTRY3ERVICEDATABASE\f SPECIALTABULATIONS!PRIL 3EEAPPENDIXTABLES\nAND\n\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nFigure 6-15 Global value-added revenue of computer manufacturing industry and world share of selected regions/countries: 1995\u00ad2005\n\nWorld share (%) (lines) 80\nAsia 60\nJapan 40\n20\n\nRevenue (constant 2000 $billions) (bars) 180 160\n140\n120\n100\n80 United States\n60\n40\n\nChina\n\nEU\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005\n\nEU = European Union\nNOTES: Computer manufacturing includes computer, office, and accounting machinery.

Industry, Technology, and the Global Marketplace\n\nU.S. IT Investment\nInformation technology (IT) was a major contributor to innovation and productivity gains during the 1990s. In addition to technical changes within the IT field, companies used IT to transform how their products performed and how their services were delivered. IT applications also improved the flow of information within and among organizations, which has led to productivity gains and production efficiencies.\nFrom 1992 through 2006, U.S. industry purchases of IT equipment and software exceeded industry spending on all other types of capital equipment (figure 6-16). Despite the bursting of the dot.com bubble beginning in the spring of 2000 and the economic downturn that began in March 2001, U.S. companies continued to place a high value on investments in IT. Industry spending on IT equipment and software accounted for 41% of all industry investment (including structures and equipment) in 1997, 53% in 2002, and 57% in 2006.\n\nFigure 6-16 U.S. industry investment in capital equipment and share of equipment type: 1992\u00ad2006\n\nShare (%) (lines) 60\n\nTotal investment (constant 2000 $trillions) (bars) 1.2\n\n50\n\n1.0\n\nInformation processing\n\nand software 40\n\n0.8\n\n30\n\nIndustrial\n\n0.6\n\n20 Other\n10\n\n0.4\nTransportation 0.2 equipment\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006\n\nSOURCE: Bureau of Economic Analysis, National Income and Product Accounts, http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/NIPA_ Underlying/TableView.asp SelectedTable=39&FirstYear=2006&Last Year=2007&Fre = tr, accessed 15 March 2007.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 6-23\n\nU.S. Global Position in Medium- and LowTechnology Manufacturing Industries\nS&T is used in many industries, not just high-technology manufacturing and services. Manufacturing industries not classified as high technology are divided into three categories: medium-high technology, medium-low technology, and low technology. Relevant industries include motor vehicle manufacturing and chemicals production excluding pharmaceuticals (medium-high technology), rubber and plastic production and basic metals (medium-low technology), and paper and food product production (low technology).\nThese industries use advanced manufacturing techniques, incorporate technologically advanced inputs in manufacture, and/or perform or rely on R&D in applicable scientific fields. The U.S. value added world share in medium- and low-technology industries is lower than its share of hightechnology industries, but the U.S. global position in these industries is fairly strong (table 6-10; appendix tables 6-12 and 6-13):\n Medium-high-technology industries: These industries produced $1.7 trillion in year 2000 constant dollars of value added in 2005. Although the United States is ranked third (23%) after Asia and the EU in share of world value added, it has the largest share of any individual country. U.S. and EU shares fell slightly between 1996 and 2005 while Asia's share increased from 32% to 37%, largely because of the doubling of China's world share from 4% to 8%.\n Medium-low-technology industries: The United States is also ranked third in these industries compared with Asia and the EU, although it has the largest share of any single country. Between 1996 and 2005, Asia's share grew 4 percentage points to 35%, largely because China's world share rose from 4% to 11%. Japan's share fell from 20% to 15%.\n Low-technology industries: The United States is ranked first in these industries, which produced $2 trillion in constant dollars in value added in 2005. The U.S. share of low-technology industry value added has remained steady during the past decade (30% in 2005). Asia's share rose slightly during this period, even though Japan's share fell from 18% to 14%, because China's world share doubled from 4% to 9%.\nIn addition, some industries are not classified as either manufacturing or services (see sidebar, \"U.S. Global Market Position in Other Industries\").\nU.S. Exports of Manufacturing Industries\nHigh-Technology Manufacturing Industries Data on international trade attribute products to a single coun-\ntry of origin and in some cases to a single industry. For goods manufactured in more than one country, the United States and many other countries determine country of origin on the basis\n\nof where the product was \"substantially transformed\" into the final product. For example, a General Motors car destined for export to Canada that was assembled in the United States with components imported from Germany and Japan will be labeled \"Made in the USA.\" The country where the product was \"substantially transformed\" may not necessarily be where the most value was added, although that often is the case.\nIn this chapter, trade in U.S. high-technology products is counted in two different ways. The contrasting methods may attribute products to different countries of origin (see sidebar, \"Classifying Products in Trade\").\nDuring the 1990s, U.S. high-technology industries accounted for about one-fifth of world high-technology exports, approximately twice the level of all other U.S. manufacturing industries.20 Starting in the late 1990s, however, the U.S.\n\nTable 6-10 Value-added revenue and world share of manufacturing industries by select technology levels for selected regions/countries: Selected years, 1996\u00ad2005\n(Percent)\n\nIndustry and region/country\n\n1996 2001 2005\n\nMedium-high technology All regions/countries (2000 constant $trillions)..........

Industry, Technology, and the Global Marketplace\n\nU.S. Global Market Position in Other Industries\nAgriculture, construction, mining, and utilities are not classified as either manufacturing or service industries and are not categorized by their level of technology or knowledge intensity. Like those in the manufacturing and service sectors, however, these industries incorporate and use S&T in their products and processes. For example, agriculture relies on breakthroughs in biotechnology, construction uses knowledge from materials science, mining is dependent on earth sciences, and utilities rely on advances in energy science.\nIn construction and utilities, the United States produces more than a fourth of the world's value added (table 6-11). The U.S. share of the global construction industry, valued at $1.7 trillion in constant dollars in 2005, rose from 23% to 27% during the past decade. At 17%, however, the U.S. world share of mining in 2005 was 5 percentage points less than a decade ago. The U.S. world share of agriculture edged up from 8% to nearly 11% during this period.\nClassifying Products in Trade\nThe characteristics of goods in international trade can be determined from either an industry or a product perspective:\n Industry perspective. U.S. industry exports and imports are collected from government surveys of companies with physical operations in the United States, where respondents are asked to report the value of foreign shipments and purchases from abroad. These shipments, both exports and imports, are classified by the primary industry of the responding company. Under this scheme, whether Ford Motor Company exports automobiles or tires, both types of exports would be classified under Ford's primary industry code \"manufacturer of motor vehicles and parts.\" The value of industry exports includes the value of components, inputs, or services purchased from domestic industries or imported from other countries. The value of industry imports includes the value of components, inputs, or services that may have originated from a different industry or country than the country of origin.\n Product perspective. Data on product trade, such as that reported below in the section about U.S. trade in advanced technology products, are first recorded at U.S. ports of entry. Each type of product is assigned\n\nTable 6-11\nU.S. world share and global value-added revenue of agriculture, construction, mining, and utilities: Selected years, 1996\u00ad2005\n\nSector/year\n\nU.S. world share\n(%)\n\nValue-added world revenue (2000 constant\n$billions)\n\nAgriculture\n\n1996 ....................\n\n8.4\n\n1999 ....................\n\n9.3\n\n2002 ....................\n\n9.6\n\n2005 ....................\n\n10.6\n\nConstruction\n\n1996 ....................\n\n22.7\n\n1999 ....................\n\n26.1\n\n2002 ....................\n\n26.5\n\n2005 ....................\n\n26.5\n\nMining\n\n1996 ....................\n\n23.2\n\n1999 ....................\n\n22.6\n\n2002 ....................\n\n20.1\n\n2005 ....................\n\n17.3\n\nUtilities\n\n1996 ....................\n\n27.7\n\n1999 ....................\n\n27.9\n\n2002 ....................\n\n28.1\n\n2005 ....................\n\n26.8\n\n913 975 1,003 1,081\n1,606 1,626 1,621 1,730\n580 605 643 722\n686 727 745 805\n\nNOTES: Value-added revenue excludes purchase of domestic and foreign materials and supplies.

Losses in communications equipment and office machinery and computers, which collectively account for nearly 60% of U.S. high-technology exports, primarily drove the decline in U.S. export share (figure 6-18; appendix tables 6-16 through 6-19).\nThe drop in the U.S. export share coincided with the rapid rise of China's high-technology export industries that began in 1999 (figure 6-17; appendix tables 6-14 and 6-15). Between 1999 and 2005, China's export share more than doubled from 8% to 19%. China surpassed Japan in 2001, the EU in 2002, and overtook the United States in 2003, becoming the world's largest exporter as measured by world market share.21 China's rise in market share has been driven by its exports from the office machinery and computers and communications equipment industries (appendix tables 6-16 through 6-19). Between 2000 and 2005, China's world export share in office machinery and computers tripled from 10% to 30% and its share in communications equipment more than doubled from 10% to 21%.

Industry, Technology, and the Global Marketplace\n\nMedium- and Low-Technology Manufacturing Industries\nCompared with trends for high-technology industries, the United States has historically had lower world export shares in non-high-technology manufacturing industries, although these, too, have converged somewhat starting in the late 1990s. The U.S. share of world exports in medium-high-technology industries was 11% in 2005, nearly equal to its share in hightechnology industries (table 6-12; appendix tables 6-12 and 6-13). This makes the United States the third-ranked exporter in these industries behind Japan (13%) and the EU (excluding intra-EU exports) (12%). The market position of these three economies has not changed over the past decade. China, however, has made rapid strides; its world export share in these industries has doubled from 4% in 1996 to 8% in 2005.\nThe United States ranks third in exports of medium-lowtechnology industries, with a world share in 2005 of 7% (table 6-12; appendix tables 6-12 and 6-13).

The U.S. share of exports of low-technology industries in 2005 was 8%, ranked third behind the EU (14%) and China (16%). China's world export share is nearly double that of the United States, having grown 5 percentage points since 1996.\nTrade Balance of High-Technology Industries\nU.S. high-technology industries consistently exported more than they imported throughout the 1980s to early 1990s, in contrast to the consistent deficits recorded by other U.S. manufacturing industries.22 The trade balance of hightechnology industries shifted from surplus to deficit in the late 1990s, however, because imports of high-technology manufacturing industries grew almost twice as fast as exports during that decade (figure 6-19; appendix tables 6-14 and 6-15). In 2000, the deficit was $32 billion in constant dollars, equivalent to 4% of gross revenues of U.S. high-technology manufacturing industries; in 2005, the deficit widened to $135 billion, amounting to 14% of gross revenue.\nTwo industries are driving the U.S. high-technology industry trade deficit: communications equipment and office machinery and computing. In 2005, these two industries ran a collective deficit of more than $140 billion in constant dollars (figure 6-20). The emergence of large deficits in these industries coincided with rising domestic output, stimulating imports of components. The deficit in office machinery and computing was not only a major driver of the overall trade deficit but was also quite large when viewed as a share of\n\nFigure 6-19 Trade balance and share of gross revenue for U.S. high-technology manufacturing industries: 1989\u00ad2005\n\nShare of gross revenue (%) (line) Constant 2000 dollars (billions) (bars)\n\n10\n\n50\n\n5 0\n0\n\n\u00ad5\n\n\u00ad50\n\n\u00ad10 \u00ad100\n\u00ad15\n\n\u00ad20\n\n\u00ad150\n\n1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005\n\nNOTES: High-technology manufacturing industries classified by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and include aerospace, communications e uipment, office machinery and computers, pharmaceuticals, and scientific instruments.

In 2005, this industry's trade deficit represented about a 60% share of gross revenues, the largest share of any U.S. high-technology industry (appendix tables 6-18 and 6-19). The pharmaceuticals industry ran a deficit of $13 billion in 2005.\nTwo other high-technology industries, scientific instruments and aerospace, are not contributors to the trade deficit. The U.S. aerospace industry registered a $22 billion trade surplus in 2005, continuing its trend of sizable trade surpluses since the late 1990s. The U.S. scientific instruments manufacturing industry had a modest $1 billion surplus in 2005.\nU.S. Trade Balance in Technology Products\nThe methodology used to identify high-technology industries relies on a comparison of R&D intensities. R&D intensity is typically determined by comparing industry R&D expenditures or the number of technical people employed (e.g., scientists, engineers, and technicians) with industry value added or the total value of shipments (see sidebar, \"Comparison of Data Classification Systems Used\"). Classification systems based on industry R&D intensity tend to overstate the level of high-technology exports by including all products shipped overseas by those high-technology industries, regardless of the level of technology embodied in each product, and by the somewhat subjective process of assigning products to specific industries.\n\nIn contrast, the Census Bureau has developed a classification system for exports and imports that embody new or leading-edge technologies. The system allows a more highly disaggregated, focused examination of embodied technologies and categorizes trade into 10 major technology areas:\n Biotechnology. The medical and industrial application of advanced genetic research to the creation of drugs, hormones, and other therapeutic items for both agricultural and human uses.\n Life science technologies. The application of nonbiological scientific advances to medicine. For example, advances such as nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiography, and novel chemistry, coupled with new drug manufacturing techniques, have led to new products that help control or eradicate disease.\n Optoelectronics. The development of electronics and electronic components that emit or detect light, including optical scanners, optical disk players, solar cells, photosensitive semiconductors, and laser printers.\n Information and communications. The development of products that process increasing amounts of information in shorter periods of time, including computers, video conferencing, routers, radar apparatus, communications satellites, central processing units, and peripheral units such as disk drives, control units, modems, and computer software.\n Electronics. The development of electronic components (other than optoelectronic components), including in-\n\n\f6-28 \n\nChapter 6. Industry, Technology, and the Global Marketplace\n\ntegrated circuits, multilayer printed circuit boards, and surface-mounted components, such as capacitors and resistors, that improve performance and capacity and, in many cases, reduce product size.\n Flexible manufacturing. The development of products for industrial automation, including robots, numerically controlled machine tools, and automated guided vehicles, that permit greater flexibility in the manufacturing process and reduce human intervention.\n Advanced materials. The development of materials, including semiconductor materials, optical fiber cable, and videodisks, that enhance the application of other advanced technologies.\n Aerospace. The development of aircraft technologies, such as most new military and civil airplanes, helicopters, spacecraft (communications satellites excepted), turbojet aircraft engines, flight simulators, and automatic pilots.\n Weapons. The development of technologies with military applications, including guided missiles, bombs, torpedoes, mines, missile and rocket launchers, and some firearms.\n Nuclear technology. The development of nuclear production apparatus (other than nuclear medical equipment), including nuclear reactors and parts, isotopic separation equipment, and fuel cartridges. (Nuclear medical apparatus is included in life sciences rather than this category.)\nTo be included in a category, a product must contain a significant amount of one of these leading-edge technologies, accounting for a significant portion of the product's value. In this report, computer software is examined separately, creating an 11th technology area.23 In official statistics, computer software is included in the information and communications technology area (see sidebar, \"Comparison of Data Classification Systems Used\").\nImportance of Advanced Technology Products to U.S. Trade\nDuring much of the 1990s, U.S. trade in advanced technology products grew in importance as it accounted for larger and larger shares of overall U.S. trade (exports plus imports) in merchandise, producing consistent trade surpluses for the United States. Beginning in 2000 and coinciding with the dot.com collapse, the trade balance for U.S. technology products began to erode, about the same time the U.S. trade balance in high-technology industries shifted to a deficit (figures 6-20 and 6-21; appendix table 6-20).24 In 2002, U.S. imports of advanced technology products exceeded exports, resulting in the very first U.S. trade deficit in this market segment. The U.S. trade deficit in advanced technology products grew larger each year thereafter until 2006, when it contracted somewhat. In 2002, the U.S. trade deficit in advanced technology products was $17.5 billion; in 2003, it increased to $27.4 billion, then again increased\n\nFigure 6-21 U.S. merchandise trade balance, by product type: 1990\u00ad2006\nDollars (billions)\n100\n0 Advanced technology products\n\n\u00ad200\n\nAll other products\n\n\u00ad400\n\n\u00ad600\n\n\u00ad800\n\n\u00ad1,000 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006\nNOTES: Technology products from special tabulations.

Contract manufacturing by U.S. companies in Asia and elsewhere may be a factor in this trend. The deficit was smaller in 2006, dropping to $38.3 billion, although still larger than any year except 2005.\nThe U.S. trade deficit is largely driven by trade deficits with Asia, especially with China and Malaysia. U.S. trade with the rest of the world is either relatively balanced or in surplus (figure 6-22; appendix table 6-21).\nTechnologies Generating a Trade Surplus\nThroughout most of the 1990s, U.S. exports of advanced technology products generally exceeded imports in 8 of the 11 technology areas.25 Since 2000, the number of technology areas showing a trade surplus has slipped to five or six (figure 6-23; appendix table 6-20).\nTrade in aerospace products has consistently produced the largest surpluses for the United States since the 1990s. In 2005, U.S. trade in aerospace products generated a net inflow of $37.2 billion, which rose to $53.6 billion in 2006 (figure 6-23; appendix table 6-20). U.S. trade classified as electronics products (e.g., electronic components including integrated circuits, circuit boards, capacitors, and resistors) is the only other technology area that has generated large surpluses in recent years. In 2000, U.S. trade in electronics products generated a net inflow of $15.2 billion, which increased to $16.1 billion in 2002, then rose to more than $21 billion in both 2003 and 2004, and rose again to $25.4 billion in 2006. Trade activity in biotechnology, computer software, flexible manufacturing products (e.g., industrial automation products, robotics), and weapon technologies also has generated small surpluses during the past few years.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 6-29\n\nFigure 6-22 U.S. advanced technology product trade balance, by world and region: 2000\u00ad06\nU.S. dollars (billions)\n40\n\n20\n\nEurope\n\nLatin America\n\n0\n\n\u00ad20\n\nAsia\n\nWorld\n\nNAFTA\n\n\u00ad40\n\n\u00ad60\n\n\u00ad80 2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\nNAFTA = North American Free Trade Agreement\nNOTES: Asia includes China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand.

Rapidly rising imports of life science technologies during the late 1990s produced the first U.S. trade deficit in that third technology area in 1999. Since 2000, U.S. imports have exceeded exports in about half of the 11 technology areas; the largest trade deficits continue to be in the information and communications technology area (figure 6-23; appendix table 6-20). In 2006, imports exceeded exports in five technology areas. U.S. trade in information and communications resulted in a net outflow of $93.2 billion; net outflows in life science technologies and optoelectronics were $15 billion and $14.5 billion, respectively. Small deficits were also recorded in nuclear technologies ($1.4 billion) and advanced materials ($0.8 billion).\nTop Customers by Technology Area\nAsia, Europe, and North America together purchase nearly 85% of all U.S. exports of advanced technology products. Asia is the destination for about 40% of these exports, Europe about 26%, and Canada and Mexico together about 17% (appendix table 6-21). China, Canada, and Japan are the largest country customers across a broad range of U.S. technology products, with China accounting for about 10% of all U.S. exports of advanced technology products in 2006, Canada for about 9%, and Japan about 8% (table 6-13; ap-\n\nNuclear technologies\nComputer software\n\u00ad100 \u00ad80 \u00ad60 \u00ad40 \u00ad20 0 20 40 60 80 U.S. dollars (billions)\nSOURCES: Census Bureau, Foreign Trade Division, special tabulations (2007); and FedStats data on total product trade, http://www.fedstats.gov.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\npendix table 6-21). In 2006, China ranked among the top three customers in 5 of the 11 technology areas, Mexico in 4 areas, Canada in 3 areas, and Japan in 7 areas.\nAsia is a major export market for the United States. In addition to the broad array of technology products sold to Japan, the latest data show that China is among the top three customers in aerospace, advanced materials, software, electronics, and information and communications technologies. Taiwan is among the top three customers in optoelectronics, flexible manufacturing, and nuclear technologies, South Korea in flexible manufacturing and weapons technologies, and Malaysia in electronics technologies.\nEuropean countries are also important consumers of U.S. technology products, particularly Germany, the UK, France, and the Netherlands. The European market is particularly important in two technology areas: biotechnology and aero-\n\n\f6-30 \n\nChapter 6. Industry, Technology, and the Global Marketplace\n\nspace. The Netherlands, Belgium, and the UK are the top customers for U.S. biotechnology products, together consuming more than half of all U.S. exports within this technology area. Germany is the leading European consumer of U.S. life science technologies and optoelectronics, whereas France and the UK are the leading European consumers of U.S. aerospace technology products.\nTop Suppliers by Technology Area\nThe United States is not only an important exporter of technologies to the world but also a major consumer of imported technologies. The leading economies in Asia, Europe,\n\nand North America are important suppliers to the U.S. market in each of the 11 technology areas examined. Together, they supply about 97% of all U.S. imports across all classes of advanced technology products (table 6-14; appendix table 6-21). In 2006, Asia supplied more than 60%, Europe about 21%, and North America about 16%.\nChina is by far the largest supplier of technology products to the United States, as the source for 25% of U.S. imports in 2006, followed by Mexico with 11% (table 6-14; appendix table 6-21). By comparison, Japan, the third largest supplier, was a distant second among all Asian sources, supplying 9% of U.S. technology imports in 2006.

In the electronics technology area, the top three suppliers are all in Asia and supply about 38% of total U.S. imports.\nAmong European countries, Germany, the UK, and France are major suppliers of technology products to the United States. Many smaller European countries also have become important sources for technology products, although they tend to specialize. Ireland was among the top suppliers of life science and biotechnology products to the United States in 2006, as the source for 35% and 11%, respectively, of U.S. imports in these categories (table 6-14; appendix table 6-21). Belgium supplied 9% of U.S. biotechnology imports, and the Netherlands supplied 10% of U.S. flexible manufacturing technology imports in 2006.\nU.S. Royalties and Fees Generated From Intellectual Property\nCompanies trade intellectual property when they license or franchise proprietary technologies, trademarks, and entertainment products to entities in other countries. Trade in intellectual property can involve patented and unpatented techniques, processes, formulas, and other intangible assets and proprietary rights; broadcast rights and other intangible rights; and the rights to distribute, use, and reproduce general-use computer software. These transactions generate revenues in the form of royalties and licensing fees.26 The exception is contract manufacturing, which may permit the use of intellectual property without a licensing fee.\nU.S. Royalties and Fees From All Transactions\nIn contrast to the country's merchandise trade position, the United States runs a surplus from its trade of intellectual property (figure 6-24; appendix table 6-22). U.S. receipts from licensing of intellectual property have grown every year since 1986 (except for 2001) and in 2005 reached $57.4 billion, 9% higher than in 2004 (appendix table 6-22). U.S. payments for foreign intellectual property were $24.5 billion in 2005, 6% higher than 2004 and more than 20% higher than in 2003. The slowdown in 2005 primarily resulted from a falling off of U.S. company payments to unaffiliated foreigners. In 2004, U.S. payments to foreign companies spiked because of payments to broadcast the summer Olympic Games in Greece (BEA 2006).\nIn 2005, U.S. trade in intellectual property produced a surplus of $32.9 billion, up 12% from the $29.3 billion surplus recorded a year earlier (figure 6-24; appendix table 6-22). About three-quarters of transactions involved exchanges of intellectual property between U.S. companies and their foreign affiliates.27 Companies with marketable intellectual property may prefer affiliated over unaffiliated transactions to exercise greater control over the distribution and use of this property, especially when the intellectual property is\n\nFigure 6-24 U.S. receipts and payments of trade for intellectual property and receipts share of trade volume: 1989\u00ad2005\n\nDollars (billions) (lines) 60\n\nShare (%) (bars) 100\nReceipts\n\n80\n\n40 60\n\nPayments\n\n40\n\n20\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005\n\nSOURCE: Bureau of Economic Analysis, Survey of Current Business 86(10):50\u00ad54 (2006). See appendix table 6-22.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\ninstrumental to the company's competitive position in the marketplace (Branstetter, Fisman, and Foley 2005). Despite the greater value of transactions among affiliated companies, both affiliated and unaffiliated transactions have grown at the same pace during the past two decades (appendix table 6-22). These trends suggest a greater internationalization of U.S. business activity and a growing reliance on intellectual property developed overseas.28\nU.S. Royalties and Fees From U.S. Trade Between Unaffiliated Companies\nData on intellectual property transactions between unaffiliated companies, in which prices are set through market-based negotiation, may better reflect the value of U.S. intellectual property than data on exchanges between affiliated companies. About 80% of receipts and payments from trade of U.S. intellectual property with unaffiliated foreign companies are generated by licenses for manufacturing know-how and computer software (figure 6-25; appendix table 6-23).\nTrade in manufacturing know-how as described above consists of U.S. trade in industrial processes (including patents and trade secrets) used in the production of goods. Trade in computer software consists of cross-border software licensing agreements, such as on-site licensing. When receipts (sales of manufacturing know-how and software license agreements) consistently exceed payments (purchases), these data may indicate a comparative advantage in the creation of industrial technology and licensing of computer software. These data also provide an indicator of trends in the production and diffusion of these technologies as intellectual property.\n\n\f6-32 \n\nChapter 6.

See appendix tables 6-23 to 6-25.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nU.S. Royalties and Fees From Trade in Manufacturing Know-How\nThe United States is a net exporter of manufacturing know-how sold as intellectual property (table 6-15; appendix tables 6-23 and 6-24). In 2005, the surplus from trade in manufacturing know-how was $3.9 billion, which was\n\n$1 billion greater than the 2004 surplus because of strong growth in receipts and a flat trend for payments.\nThe U.S. surplus from trade in manufacturing know-how is driven largely by trade with Asia (BEA 2007) (table 6-15; appendix table 6-24).29 Asia has been the single largest consumer of U.S. manufacturing know-how for the past 20 years, led primarily by Japan.30 With a 39% share of total receipts in 2005, Japan has historically spent more to purchase U.S. manufacturing technology than any other country. South Korea, a major consumer of U.S. manufacturing know-how since the early 1990s, had the second highest share of any country, accounting for 19% of total U.S. receipts in 2005.\nChina's and Taiwan's shares of total receipts are much smaller than those of Japan or South Korea, although they have increased over the past decade (table 6-15; appendix table 6-24). China's and Taiwan's shares were 3% and 6% of total receipts in 2005, respectively, at least double their levels in 1995. Asia was also an important supplier of manufacturing know-how to U.S. companies during this period, although U.S. purchases from Asia largely consisted of trade with Japan. In 2005, Asia supplied nearly 16% of U.S. manufacturing know-how licensed from foreign sources, of which close to 90% came from Japan.\nUnlike trade with Asia, U.S. trade with the EU in manufacturing know-how is much more balanced (table 6-15; appendix table 6-24). Receipts from the EU were $1.3 billion in 2005, accounting for 20% of all U.S. receipts from U.S. intellectual property trade in manufacturing know-how. France, Germany, and the UK accounted for more than half\n\nTable 6-15 U.S. royalties and fees generated from trade in manufacturing know-how between unaffiliated companies, by share of selected region/country/economy: 1995 and 2005\n(Percent distribution)\n\nReceipts\n\nPayments\n\nRegion/country/economy\n\n1995\n\n2005\n\n1995\n\n2005\n\nAll royalties and fees ($billions) .................................................

Payments to the EU were about $1.6 billion in 2005, accounting for 61% of total payments. France, Germany, and the UK received more than half of U.S. payments to the EU to license its manufacturing know-how.\nU.S. Royalties and Fees From Licensing of Computer Software\nThe United States is also a net exporter when licensing computer software (table 6-16; appendix tables 6-23 and 6-25). The trade surplus from computer software licensing transactions reached a record high of $4.8 billion in 2005, driven by much faster growth in receipts relative to payments. Although 2005 receipts from transactions involving manufacturing know-how ($6.6 billion) were greater than those involving computer software ($5.5 billion), U.S. companies paid almost four times as much for foreign manufacturing know-how ($2.7 billion) than for foreign computer software ($0.7 billion).\nIncomplete data suggest that Asia is a large licensor of U.S. computer software (table 6-16; appendix table 6-25). Asia was responsible for more than half of all licensing fees paid to U.S. companies for computer software in 2005. Since 1998, the first year that data were collected on computer software licensing, Asia's share has steadily increased, surpassing the EU's share in 2001. Japan is the largest purchaser of U.S. computer software of any country, accounting for 31% of total U.S. receipts in 2005, which is more than 8 percent-\n\nage points higher than in 1998. South Korea, the only other Asian country from which data are consistently available, had a 5% share in 2005.\nThe EU accounted for 30% of U.S. receipts from licensing of computer software in 2005. About three-fourths of the EU's receipts originated from France, Germany, and the UK (table 6-16; appendix table 6-25). Even so, the EU licenses more computer software to U.S. companies than any other region. In 2005, U.S. companies purchased more than 85% of the $0.7 billion spent worldwide on computer software from the EU. The EU, however, spends considerably more on licensing computer software from U.S. companies; as a result, the EU's deficit in 2005 for this trade area was $1.1 billion.\nNew High-Technology Exporters\nSeveral nations are rapidly becoming more competitive in international high-technology trade. Large ongoing investments in S&T, education, and R&D31 have supported their progress, but other factors, such as political stability, access to capital, and an infrastructure that can support technological and economic advancement, are likely to affect their ability to advance in the future.\nThis section presents four indicators that may be relevant to the long-term potential of developing economies to maintain or improve their competitiveness in international hightechnology markets. National scores on each indicator are computed using both statistical data and systematic expert assessments (Porter et al. 2005).32 The indicators are:\n\nTable 6-16 U.S. royalties and fees generated from trade in computer software between unaffiliated companies, by share of selected region/country/economy: 1998 and 2005\n(Percent distribution)\n\nReceipts\n\nPayments\n\nRegion/country/economy\n\n1998\n\n2005\n\n1998\n\n2005\n\nAll royalties and fees ($billions) .................................................\n\n3.2\n\n5.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.7\n\nAll royalties and fees .................................................................\n\n100.0\n\n100.0\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nAsia ........................................................................................\n\n37.0\n\n51.1\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nChina ..................................................................................\n\n2.0\n\nD\n\nNA\n\nD\n\nJapan .................................................................................\n\n22.7\n\n31.1\n\n5.2\n\n0.4\n\nSouth Korea .......................................................................\n\nD\n\n4.9\n\nNA\n\n0.0\n\nTaiwan ................................................................................\n\n6.7\n\nD\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\nEU ..........................................................................................\n\n42.2\n\n30.3\n\n89.6\n\n86.2\n\nFrance ................................................................................\n\n4.8\n\n2.0\n\nD\n\nD\n\nGermany .............................................................................\n\n13.9\n\n13.3\n\n15.3\n\n2.7\n\nUnited Kingdom .................................................................\n\n10.0\n\n7.2\n\n7.6\n\n10.0\n\nOther ......................................................................................\n\n20.8\n\n18.6\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nNA = not available; D = suppressed to avoid disclosure of confidential information\n\nEU = European Union\n\nNOTES: Computer software includes rights to distribute and use general-use software.

This term refers to the social and economic institutions that help a nation develop, produce, and market new technology. This indicator combines statistical data on the number of scientists employed in R&D and electronic data processing purchases with expert assessments of technical training and education, industrial R&D, and technological mastery.\n Socioeconomic infrastructure. This term refers to the social and economic institutions necessary to sustain and advance technology-based development. This indicator combines statistical data on educational attainment with expert assessments of national policies toward multinational investment and capital mobility.\n Productive capacity. This term refers to the physical and human resources devoted to manufacturing products and the efficiency with which these resources are used. This indicator combines statistical data on electronics production with expert assessments of the management capability and indigenous supply of skilled labor and component parts for high-technology manufactured goods.\n National orientation. This term refers to national policies, institutions, and public opinion that help a nation become technologically competitive. This indicator combines a statistical measure of investment risk with expert assessments of national strategy, implementation, entrepreneurship, and attitudes toward technology.\nIn their present form, these four indicators have been tracked for a relatively stable set of developing and industrialized countries since the early 1990s. Because these indicators were designed to forecast long-term changes in national high-technology competitiveness, especially among developing nations, analyses of whether and how they predict future competitiveness and how they compare to other measures remain preliminary and inconclusive (Porter et al. 2001).33 As a result, the primary value of these indicators at this stage is that they synthesize a large amount of potentially relevant data in a way that enables systematic comparisons and lays the groundwork for more probing analyses in the near future.\nThis section examines composite scores of the four indicators in 2007 for 14 developing countries, classified as middle or low income by the World Bank. The developing countries were divided into groups of larger and smaller economies according to their 2004 GDP in 1990 purchasing power parities: larger being economies that are greater or equal to $750 billion and smaller being less than $750 billion).\nAccording to its 2007 composite score, China is the highest ranked of the six large developing economies examined (table 6-17; appendix table 6-26). Ranked fourth a decade ago, China moved to second in 1999, then to first in 2002, overtaking India, the previous leader. China's ascent was largely driven by a near doubling of its productive capacity indicator score over the last decade. The high rankings of both China and India in part result from advantages associated with size: a large and rapidly growing domestic market,\n\na big population, and a growing number of scientifically and technically trained graduates.\nRussia's ranking has fluctuated over the last decade (table 6-17; appendix table 6-26). In 2007, it was third, ahead of Mexico and Brazil. Mexico's 2007 ranking was higher than in past cycles as a result of rising scores for all four indicators. Brazil continued a decade-long decline resulting from low or negative growth for all four indicators. Indonesia has been ranked last among the six large developing economies for much of the decade.\nAmong the eight smaller developing economies examined, Malaysia ranks first in future high-technology export potential, followed by Poland and Hungary (table 6-18; appendix table 6-26). Thailand, ranked fourth, improved from its seventh rank in 1999 and 2002 as a result of growth for all four indicators. South Africa, Argentina, the Philippines, and Venezuela occupy the bottom half of this group. Among these countries, the Philippines has exhibited the most change in its position during the last decade, dropping from first in 1996 to seventh in 2007. Venezuela has been the lowestranked of the eight countries for the last decade. Although higher-ranked than Venezuela, the remaining two countries,\n\nTable 6-17\nRanking of future high-technology export potential for larger developing countries: Selected years, 1996\u00ad2007\n\nCountry\n\n1996 1999 2002 2005 2007\n\nChina .......................\n\n4\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nIndia .........................\n\n2\n\n1\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\nRussia ......................\n\n1\n\n4\n\n2\n\n4\n\n3\n\nMexico .....................\n\n5\n\n6\n\n5\n\n5\n\n4\n\nBrazil ........................\n\n3\n\n3\n\n4\n\n3\n\n5\n\nIndonesia .................\n\n6\n\n5\n\n6\n\n6\n\n6\n\nNOTES: Countries grouped by 2007 ranking.

This section focuses on trends first in the number and share of S&E articles produced by authors affiliated with industry, then in their collaboration patterns with other U.S. sectors and internationally.34\nNumber of Articles Trends in the number of S&E articles written by indus-\ntrial researchers that appear in peer-reviewed journals, while not a direct indicator of innovation, are a rough indicator of outputs from research being carried out in industrial settings.\n\nThis section examines the total number of articles authored by industry researchers as an indicator of overall industrial research activity, and the number of articles by these researchers published in basic research journals as an indicator of the volume of basic research carried out in industrial laboratories.35\nArticles With an Industrial Author The number of scientific articles with at least one author\nin U.S. private industry fluctuated between about 13,000 and 16,000 per year between 1988 and 2005, peaking at slightly more than 16,000 in 1991, then falling to its lowest level just below 13,000 in 2004. During this same period, however, the total number of U.S. S&E articles increased from 169,000 to 215,000 (appendix table 6-27). Consequently, industry's overall share of U.S. article output declined from just below 9% to about 6% (figure 6-26).\nSix broad fields accounted for about 90% of the S&E literature by U.S. industry authors from 1988 to 2005: biological sciences, medical sciences, engineering, chemistry, physics, and the geosciences. With one exception, the number of industry articles peaked in 1995 or earlier for all of\n\nFigure 6-26 U.S. S&E articles by authors in private industry as share of all U.S. S&E articles, by selected field: 1988\u00ad2005\n\nPercent\n\n30\n\nEngineering\n\nPhysics\n\nChemistry\n\nAll fields\n\nGeosciences\n\nBiological sciences\n\nMedical sciences 20\n\n10\n\n0 1988\n\n1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005\n\nNOTES: Fields are those in which authors from private industry made significant contribution (500 articles/year).

The exception is medical sciences, for which articles increased throughout the period, peaking in 2005. In four of these broad fields, industry's share of all U.S. articles in the field declined between 1988 and 2005, from 26% to 14% in engineering, 18% to 8% in physics, 17% to 11% in chemistry, and 7% to 5% in the geosciences. Industry's share of articles in the biological sciences remained stable throughout the period (between 6% and 8%), whereas its share of articles in the medical sciences increased (from 3% to 5%) (figure 6-26).\nArticles in Basic Research Journals Between 1988 and 1995, the total number of basic re-\nsearch articles having authors in U.S. private industry fluctuated between 3,400 and 4,200 per year (appendix table 6-28). However, after peaking in 1995, the number declined by 30% through 2005. In contrast, the total number of basic research articles by authors from all sectors grew between 1995 and 2005. As a result, industry's share of this output declined, from slightly more than 6% to 4% (figure 6-27).\nFive broad fields accounted for about 95% of the basic research literature by U.S. industry authors during the entire 18-year period: biological sciences, chemistry, physics, the geosciences, and the medical sciences. The trend in the number of basic research articles by U.S. industry researchers in the biological, medical, and geosciences, as a percentage of basic research articles in those fields, generally mirrored the trend for all fields, with gradual declines in share of about 1 percentage point.\nArticle output by U.S.-industry authors in physics and chemistry showed notably different patterns. In physics, the total number of these articles decreased sharply from nearly 1,000 in 1988 to about 300 in 2005. As a result, industry's share of basic research articles in physics dropped by more than 7 percentage points (figure 6-27). Most of this decline is accounted for by widespread restructuring of a few large corporations during this period, including closure, downsizing, or reorientation of large central research laboratories. Increased globalization, intensified competition, and commercial priorities may have contributed to the decline in publishing by companies and their researchers.\nThe pattern in chemistry has been different. U.S.-industry authors' share of basic research articles in chemistry fluctuated between 9% and 13% over the period. Researchers at large pharmaceutical companies continued or increased their already strong publishing traditions in chemistry basic research journals despite consolidation within the industry. The pharmaceutical industry's far greater reliance on patents and exclusivity for intellectual property protection relative to other industries may have played a role in its continued strong publishing record. Beyond pharmaceuticals, some of the same companies that saw declines in physics basic research articles also declined in chemistry.\n\nChanging Emphasis on Basic Research Industrial publications tended to shift away from basic\nresearch between 1988 and 2005. After peaking at 26% in 1995, the percentage of articles with an industrial author published in basic research journals declined to 22% by 2005 (figure 6-28).36 This declining emphasis on basic research in industry publications has been especially strong in the biological sciences (from around 50% in the early 1990s to 39% in 2005), in physics (from 31% in 1988 to 20% in 2005), and in the medical sciences (from 10% in the early- to mid-1990s to 5% in 2005). Again, however, the pattern in chemistry has been quite different. The basic research share of industrially authored articles in chemistry increased from around 30% during the late 1980s to 46% in 2005.\nIndustry Collaboration in Publications\nBoth in the United States and worldwide, a major increase in collaboration across sectors and countries on S&E publications has been evident during the past decade. (For a more complete discussion of collaboration patterns, see \"Coauthorship and Collaboration\" and \"Trends in Output and Collaboration Among U.S. Sectors\" in chapter 5.)\nFigure 6-27 U.S. S&E basic research articles by authors in private industry as share of all U.S. S&E basic research articles, by selected field: 1988\u00ad2005\nPercent 15\n\n10 Physics Chemistry All fields Geosciences Biological sciences Medical sciences\n5\n\n0 1988\n\n1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005\n\nNOTES: Fields have basic research journals to which authors from private industry make significant contribution (100 articles/year).

See appendix table 6-28.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nArticles by Institutional Author Type Articles with one or more authors in private industry can\nbe broken down into five unique types:\n Single company-single author37\n Single company-multiple authors\n Multiple companies, with authors from more than one U.S. company\n Multiple sectors, with U.S. authors from more than one sector38\n International, with at least one foreign author.\nBetween 1988 and 2005, single company-single author articles declined by almost 60% (to about 2,000) and single company-multiple author articles declined by almost 40% (also to about 2,000) (appendix table 6-29). Multiplecompany articles increased by 20% during this period. In contrast, multiple-sector articles and international articles increased by about 70% and 300%, respectively (about 5,000 in both cases). The net result of these trends were drops from 19% to 6% in the proportion of single company-single author articles and from 30% to 14% for single companymultiple author articles. During the period, international articles increased from 9% to 26% and multiple-sector articles increased from 36% to 47% (figure 6-29).\nIndustry Collaboration Across U.S. Sectors Coauthorship data indicate that U.S. industry collaborates\nmore frequently with the academic sector than with other U.S. sectors.39 Since 1988, more than 60% of the articles that industry authors have coauthored with someone outside their company have had an academic coauthor (appendix table 6-30). This is\n\nFigure 6-29 S&E articles with industry authors, by institutional author type: 1988, 1995, and 2005\nPercent\n\n50\n\n1988\n\n1995\n\n2005\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0 Single company/\nsingle author\n\nSingle company/ multiple authors\n\nMultiple companies\n\nMultiple sectors\n\nInternational\n\nNOTE: Percentages based on whole counts and an expanding journal set.\n\nSOURCES: Thomson Scientific, Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index, http://www.scientific.thomson.com/products/categories/ citation/; ipI , Inc.; and National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, special tabulations.

Industry, Technology, and the Global Marketplace\n\nnot unexpected, because the vast majority of S&E articles with a U.S. author include an author from academia.\nAlthough the number of industry articles not limited to a single company increased substantially between 1988 and 2005, collaboration patterns between industry and other sectors changed very little during that period (figure 6-30). The only sector in which a large change in collaboration has occurred is the private nonprofit sector. The proportion of industry articles coauthored with the private nonprofit sector steadily increased from 9% to 15% from 1988 to 2005.\nGlobal Trends in Patenting\nTo foster inventiveness, nations assign property rights to inventors in the form of patents. These rights allow the inventor to exclude others from making, using, or selling the invention for a limited period of time in exchange for publicly disclosing details and licensing the use of the invention.40 Inventors obtain patents from government-authorized agencies for inventions judged to be \"new...useful...and... nonobvious.\"41\nPatented inventions are of great economic importance when they result in new or improved products or processes or even entirely new industries, and, as is increasingly the case, when their licensing provides an important source of revenue. Worldwide revenues from patent licensing increased from $15 billion in 1990 to $110 billion in 2000 (Idris 2003).\nThis discussion focuses on patent activity at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the European Patent Office (EPO).42 These two patent offices are among the largest in the world in terms of volume of patents and have a\n\nsignificant share of applications and grants from foreign inventors.43 The size and openness of the U.S. and EU markets offer potentially higher returns than smaller markets. Therefore, many domestic and foreign companies sell new products and services there and have a strong incentive to patent their inventions in both the United States and the EU.\nThese market attributes make data on patenting in the United States and Europe informative for the purpose of identifying trends in global inventiveness. Patenting indicators have several well-known drawbacks, however, including:\n Incompleteness. Many inventions are not patented at all, in part because laws in some countries already protect industrial trade secrets.\n Inconsistency across industries and fields. The propensity to patent and the type and intensity of R&D differ by industry and technology area. For example, pharmaceutical companies patent more heavily and engage in years of costly R&D before achieving a fundamental breakthrough, whereas computer software companies patent less heavily and achieve more rapid but generally more incremental breakthroughs.\n Inconsistency in importance. The importance of patented inventions can vary considerably. Inventors may use other methods to protect their inventions, such as secrecy and product lead time. In addition, entities with large patent portfolios manage these carefully to control the cost of filing, maintaining, and defending their patents, including assessing the marginal benefits of potential new patents.\n Varying motivations for patenting.

With these adjustments, patent data may serve as an approximate indicator of inventiveness over time. In addition, information about foreign inventors seeking patents in the United States and Europe may offer some insights into inventiveness in and new technological competition from foreign countries (see sidebar, \"Comparison of Data Classification Systems Used\"). The discussion also examines data on U.S. patents granted to U.S. inventors by type of ownership and by state.\nApplications for Patents in the United States and Europe\nTrends in the number and sources of patent applications provide indicators of new sources of high-technology competition.

Starting in the mid-1990s, the growth rate of USPTO applications doubled compared with the 1980s and the early 1990s (figure 6-32). The acceleration of U.S. patent applications coincided with a strengthening of the patent system and extension of patent protection into new technology areas through policy changes and judicial decisions during the 1980s and 1990s (NRC 2004).\nInventors residing in the United States filed 208,000 applications in 2005, a little more than half of all U.S. patent applications filed that year.45 Again starting in the mid1990s, the growth rate for patent filings by U.S. inventors accelerated, but not as fast as the growth rate for filings by foreign inventors; the U.S. share dropped from 55% in 1996 to 53% in 2005 (appendix table 6-33). This may be indica-\n\n\f6-40 \n\nChapter 6. Industry, Technology, and the Global Marketplace\n\nU.S. Patents Granted by State and Type of Ownership\n\nExamination of USPTO-issued patents provides information on patenting activity by U.S. states and type of ownership. More than half of USPTO patents issued to the United States come from seven states: California, Texas, New York, Michigan, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Illinois (table 6-19; appendix tables 6-34 and 6-35). These seven top patenting states are among the top 10 states that accounted for almost two-thirds of U.S. R&D expenditures (see Chapter 4). California, which has the largest single share of any state, has showed a steady increase in its share from 15% in 1993 to 24% in 2005.\nWhen patent output by U.S. states is adjusted for their population, however, the rankings change considerably. Two states with small populations, Idaho and Vermont, are ranked first and second, respectively, in their per capita output of U.S. patents in 2005 (figure 6-33; appendix table 6-36). Two of the six top patenting states, California and Massachusetts, however, remain highly ranked on a per capita basis.\nPatents granted to U.S. inventors can be further analyzed by patent ownership at the time of the grant. Ownership is\n\nassigned on the basis of the first-named organization listed on the patent. Corporations own the majority of patents granted to U.S. entities, and their share has been steadily increasing since the early 1990s (figure 6-34). The PTO defines the corporate sector to include U.S. corporations, small businesses, and educational institutions. U.S. universities and colleges owned about 4% of U.S. utility patents granted to corporations in 2003. (For further discussion of academic patenting, see chapter 5.)\nAlmost all patents are issued to either corporations or individuals. In 2005, U.S. corporations owned 86% of patents issued to U.S. inventors, with individuals owning 14%; in 1992, the respective shares were 74% and 24%. Corporations also own the majority of U.S. patents issued to the rest of the world, and that share also has been increasing over the past decade. The share of individual ownership in patents issued to the rest of the world, which is about half of the level in the United States, has also fallen since the early 1990s.\n\nTable 6-19 USPTO patents granted to inventors of selected states: Selected years, 1993\u00ad2005\n(Percent)\n\nState\n\n1993\n\n1995\n\n1997\n\n1999\n\n2001\n\n2003\n\n2005\n\nU.S. patents issued to all states (number) .....

Most USPTO patents credited to the United States are owned by corporations and granted to inventors in six states (see sidebar, \"U.S. Patents Granted by State and Type of Ownership\").46\nAsia and the EU are the main sources of inventors outside of the United States filing for U.S. patent applications. Inventors residing in these two regions filed nearly 90% of applications filed by foreign inventors. Asia was the firstranked foreign source in 2005, filing 112,000 U.S. patent applications (figure 6-31; appendix tables 6-31 and 6-32). Applications from Asia increased at a faster rate than those from the United States and the EU between 1985 and 2005\n\n(figure 6-32), and Asia's share of U.S. patent filings increased from 19% to 29% during this period (appendix table 6-33). Japan, which produced much of the increase in Asia's share prior to the early 1990s, showed slower growth than the rest of Asia between 1996 and 2005 (table 6-20; appendix table 6-33). The three Asian economies of China, South Korea, and Taiwan drove the increase in Asia's share of U.S. patent filings between 1996 and 2005:\n China's applications grew eightfold, and its share of U.S. patent filings quadrupled from 0.2% to 0.8%. China's share ranking moved from 20th place in 1995 to 12th place in 2005 (appendix tables 6-37 and 6-38).\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 6-41\n\nFigure 6-33 USPTO patents granted per capita for inventors from selected U.S. states: 2005\nIdaho\nVermont\nCalifornia\nMassachusetts\nMinnesota\nOregon\nConnecticut\nColorado\nNew Hampshire\nDelaware\n0 200 400 600 800 1,000 1,200 Patents/million inhabitants\nUSPTO = U.S. Patent and Trademark Office NOTES: Patents assigned to state based on residence of first-named inventor.

See appendix table 6-34.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n South Korea's applications quadrupled, doubling its share of U.S. patent filings from 2.2% to 4.4%. South Korea's rapid growth caused its share ranking to move from eighth in 1995 to fourth in 2005, moving past France, the UK, and Canada (appendix tables 6-37 and 6-38).\n Taiwan's applications more than tripled, and its share of U.S. patent filings advanced from 2.4% to 4.3%. Taiwan's share ranking moved from seventh to fifth place, moving past the same countries overtaken by South Korea (appendix tables 6-37 and 6-38).\n India's applications grew more than 12-fold, but from an extremely low base, and its share of U.S. patent filings rose from 0.1% to 0.4%. India's share ranking moved from 29th to 17th during this period (appendix tables 6-37 and 6-38).\nFrom 1996 to 2005, USPTO applications from the EU rose at the slowest rate of the three major world economies, and the EU's share of U.S. patent filings fell from 15% to 13% (figure 6-31; appendix tables 6-31 and 6-32).47 The share of U.S. patent applications from inventors in France, Germany, and the UK, as a group, declined from 11% to 9% during this period.\nA comparison of shares of USPTO patents granted among the three major world economies, the United States, Asia, and the EU, reveals trends similar to those observed concerning their applications (appendix tables 6-39 and 6-40).\nApplications for European Patents Applications for EPO patents reached nearly 114,000\nin 2004, a 1% increase from 2003 (figure 6-35; appendix tables 6-41 and 6-42).

The growth rate of U.S. applications to the EPO picked up in the mid-1990s but leveled off starting in 2001, paralleling the growth trend of EPO applications by all countries (appendix tables 6-41 and 6-42).48 Comparing U.S. applications to the EPO with those filed by inventors from the EU and Asia, the U.S. number grew at the slowest rate between 1996 and 2004, resulting in a decline of the U.S. share of filings at the EPO from 31% to 26% during this period (figure 6-35).\nAs expected, EU inventors have the largest share at the EPO with 44% of total applications in 2004 (figure 6-35; appendix table 6-33). The EU's EPO share remained flat between the mid-1990s and 2004, although the shares of some EU countries changed. The combined EPO share of France and the UK fell from 13% to 11% between 1996 and 2004, offset by small gains by Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and several other countries.\nAsia's EPO applications grew faster than those from the EU or the United States, and Asia's share of total patent filings at the EPO rose from 19% in 1996 to 22% in 2004 (figure 6-35; appendix table 6-33). During this same period, the share gap between the United States and Asia narrowed from 12 percentage points to 4. The same Asian economies that led Asia's patent filings at the USPTO, which were China, South Korea, and Taiwan, drove the rise in Asia's share of EPO patent applications.\nA comparison of shares of EPO patents granted among the three major world economies, the United States, Asia, and the EU, reveals trends similar to those observed in their applications (appendix tables 6-43 and 6-44). Gains in EPO patents granted to China, India, South Korea, and Taiwan, however, have been lower than gains in EPO applications.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 6-43\n\nPatents Granted for Information and Communications Technology and Biotechnology\nWhen inventions result in new or improved products or processes, patent owners can reap economic benefits that, in turn, typically spill over to users and consumers. Inventions that lead to the creation of entire new industries, however, have a more profound impact on national and global economies. Two examples of the latter are ICT and biotechnology patents.\nICT patents have helped to create new industries and products such as home computers, cellular phones, and wireless devices. ICT technology has revolutionized and improved productivity in non-ICT industries and services, such as the health, finance, and retail sectors.\nBiotechnology research and patents have led to entirely new industries that closely collaborate with and rely on basic research from the academic, government, and nonprofit sectors. Biotechnology patents have led to fundamental breakthroughs such as mapping the human genome and creating new diagnostic and therapeutic products. This section examines recent trends in ICT and biotechnology patenting in the United States and Europe and identifies countries that are the source for most of the ICT and biotechnology patenting in these two major markets.49\nICT Patenting The numbers of ICT patents granted by the USPTO and\nEPO have increased rapidly over the past decade and a half (table 6-21; appendix tables 6-45 and 6-46).

See appendix tables 6-43 and 6-44.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nThe United States has the largest share of ICT patents granted by the USPTO (figure 6-36; appendix tables 6-45 and 6-46). The U.S. activity index in USPTO ICT patents (the U.S. share of USPTO ICT patents compared with its share of all USPTO patents) is an indicator of U.S. patenting intensity in ICT compared with other technology areas. The U.S. activity index is around 1.0, which indicates that U.S.-resident inventors show about the same propensity to patent in ICT as in other technology areas (table 6-21; appendix table 6-47). In Europe, the United States is ranked third in share of EPO ICT patents granted. The U.S. inventor activity index at the EPO (1.13 in 2006), however, unlike its activity index at the USPTO, indicates that U.S. inventors have a higher propensity to patent ICT compared with other technologies.\nAsia is ranked second in ICT at both patent offices among the three major economic areas (table 6-21; appendix tables 6-45 and 6-46). Asia's inventors also patent more intensively in ICT compared with other technology areas, according to its activity indexes (table 6-21; appendix table 6-47). A decline in its index for ICT over the past decade, however, indicates that Asia may be expanding its patenting activity to other technology areas. Japan has the largest share of world ICT patents of any Asian economy, although its share has fallen as South Korea and Taiwan have increased their patenting of ICT. ICT patents issued by the United States and\n\nthe EPO to China and by the United States to India have sharply increased recently, although from very low levels.\nThe EU has a significantly lower presence in ICT patents compared with the United States and Asia (figure 6-36; appendix tables 6-45 and 6-46). The EU's activity index (0.76 in the USPTO and 0.80 in the EPO) indicates that the EU patents less intensively in ICT compared with other technology areas in both patent offices (appendix table 6-47). Five EU countries, however, do patent more intensively in ICT compared with the rest of the EU. In the USPTO and EPO, Finland and Ireland emphasize ICT compared with other technology areas, and the UK patents at about the same level of intensity in ICT as for other technology areas. Sweden and the Netherlands patent with the EPO more intensively in ICT than for other technology areas.\nBiotechnology Patents The number of biotechnology patents granted by the\nUSPTO accelerated rapidly in the mid-1990s, almost doubling its share of all patents granted between 1993 and 2000 (figure 6-37; table 6-22; appendix tables 6-48 and 6-49).50 The growth trend stopped and turned negative starting in 2001, however, and the biotechnology share of USPTO patents declined from 4% to 3% from 1998 to 2006. Biotechnology patents issued by the EPO, on the other hand, grew in volume between 2001 and 2006.51 In 2004, the biotechnology share of all patents granted by the EPO surpassed that granted by the USPTO.\nU.S. resident inventors have the largest share of biotechnology patents granted by the USPTO and EPO (table 6-23; appendix tables 6-48 and 6-49). The U.S. activity index in biotechnology patenting indicates that inventors residing in the United States patent more intensively in biotechnology compared with other technology areas within both patent offices. Asia has the smallest share of biotechnology patents from both patent offices compared with those of the United States and the EU. Asia's activity index in biotechnology patents also shows less emphasis on biotechnology than is evident within the United States and the EU.\nThe EU, on the other hand, ranks second to the United States in its share of biotechnology patents from both patent offices, although its activity index in EPO biotechnology patents indicates less-intensive patenting in biotechnology compared with other technology areas. The EU's activity index in USPTO, however, indicates a higher level of intensity in biotechnology compared with other technology areas (table 6-23).\nPatenting of Valuable Inventions: Triadic Patent Families\nOne limitation of using patent counts as an indicator of national inventive activity is that such counts cannot differentiate between minor inventions and highly important inventions.

These inventions are called triadic patent families.52 The high cost of filing for patents from three separate patent offices and the need to manage patent costs in competitive industries make triadic patent families a more accurate measure of inventions deemed economically valuable than simple patent counts.\nThe number of triadic family patents was estimated to be almost 54,000 in 2003 (the last year for which data are available), a 3% increase compared with 2002 (figure 6-38; appendix tables 6-50 and 6-51). Since 2001, growth in triadic patent families has flattened compared with most of the previous decade. The same three sources that file the majority of U.S. and European patents (the United States, the EU, and Asia) account for the majority (more than 90%) of triadic patent families.53 The United States has been the leading source of filings (37% of estimated world share) since 1989, when it surpassed the EU. Between 1996 and 2003, the gap between the U.S. share and the EU's share widened from less than 1 to 7 percentage points as the U.S. world share edged up and the EU's world share declined.\nAsia's share (estimated at 28% in 2003) has stayed relatively constant since the early 1990s (figure 6-38; appendix tables 6-50 and 6-51). China, India, South Korea, and Taiwan, which are the same Asian countries that have increased their share in USPTO patents, also gained world share in triadic patent families, although on a more limited basis. Japan continues to have by far the dominant share of Asian countries, accounting for more than 90% of triadic patent families credited to Asia.\n\nTable 6-23 Share and activity index for biotechnology patents granted by USPTO and EPO, by inventors from selected regions/countries: 1993, 1999, and 2006\n\n1993\n\n1999\n\n2006\n\nAgency and region/country\n\nShare (%) Activity index Share (%) Activity index Share (%) Activity index\n\nUSPTO\n\nAll regions (number) .............................................. 1,969\n\nna\n\n6,290\n\nna\n\n5,194\n\nna\n\nUnited States .................................................... 61.9\n\n1.15\n\n66.6\n\n1.22\n\n62.9\n\n1.22\n\nAsia ................................................................... 15.9\n\n0.64\n\n8.8\n\n0.35\n\n13.0\n\n0.44\n\nEU...................................................................... 16.0\n\n0.97\n\n17.7\n\n1.14\n\n16.5\n\n1.17\n\nEPO\n\nAll regions (number) .............................................. 1,176\n\nna\n\n934\n\nna\n\n2,695\n\nna\n\nUnited States .................................................... 33.2\n\n1.47\n\n42.7\n\n1.71\n\n38.7\n\n1.71\n\nAsia ................................................................... 23.2\n\n1.00\n\n13.0\n\n0.62\n\n15.0\n\n0.71\n\nEU...................................................................... 38.8\n\n1.11\n\n35.7\n\n0.74\n\n37.9\n\n0.76\n\nna = not applicable\n\nEPO = European Patent Office; EU = European Union; USPTO = U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\n\nNOTES: Biotechnology defined by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

The differences are considerably larger, however, when normalized by population. Four European countries (Finland, Switzerland, Germany, and Sweden) and Japan have a higher per capita and size-of-economy triadic patent family output than the United States.\nU.S. High-Technology Small Businesses\nMany of the new technologies and industries seen as critical to U.S. economic growth are also closely identified with small businesses, i.e., those employing fewer than 500 people. Biotechnology, the Internet, and computer software are examples of industries built around new technologies that were initially commercialized by small businesses. Operating within commercial environments characterized by fastmoving technology and rapidly changing consumer needs, small businesses learn from their customers, suppliers, and government labs and universities, and innovate based on what they have learned. This agility makes high-technology small businesses a key sector for developing, adopting, and diffusing new technologies within the U.S. economy.\n\nTable 6-24\nTriadic patents, by size of economy (GDP) and population for inventors from selected regions/ countries/economies: 2003\n\nRegion/country/ economy\n\nGDP (1990 PPP $billions)\n\nPopulation (millions)\n\nFinland.................................... 5.94 Switzerland............................. 5.43 Japan...................................... 5.02 Germany................................. 4.51 Sweden .................................. 4.20 Israel ....................................... 3.53 Netherlands ............................ 2.85 United States ........................ 2.28 EU........................................... 1.91 France .................................... 1.81 Denmark ................................. 1.60 United Kingdom ..................... 1.57 South Korea............................ 1.09 Asia ........................................ 1.08 Canada ................................... 0.95 Norway ................................... 0.95 Australia.................................. 0.93 Singapore ............................... 0.89 Italy ......................................... 0.76 Ireland..................................... 0.61 Hungary .................................. 0.28 Taiwan .................................... 0.27 South Africa............................ 0.20 Spain ...................................... 0.17 Czech Republic ...................... 0.15 Russian Federation................. 0.06 India........................................ 0.04 Brazil....................................... 0.04 China ...................................... 0.04 Mexico.................................... 0.02\n\n121.83 120.82 106.57\n86.02 90.19 58.03 62.81 66.20 36.93 39.15 37.08 33.68 17.40\n5.01 22.04 24.81 21.84 19.53 14.55 15.04\n2.29 4.77 0.85 2.86 1.46 0.39 0.09 0.19 0.17 0.16\n\nEU = European Union; GDP = gross domestic product; PPP = purchasing power parity\n\nNOTES: Triadic patent families on fractional-count basis.

(Corptech). The section reports on the number of companies, their formation, and employment figures. Two sources of financing for hightechnology small businesses are examined, using data from the National Venture Capital Association and the University of New Hampshire's Center for Venture Research.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 6-47\n\nEmployment in High-Technology Small Businesses\nAccording to Census Bureau data, U.S. small businesses employed slightly more than half of the total labor force and accounted for one-third of employment in high-technology industries54 in 2004 (table 6-25). Small businesses operating in high-technology industries numbered nearly one-half million firms and employed 5 million workers in 2004.55\nIn 2004, most workers in high-technology small businesses (67%) were in the service sector (table 6-26; appendix table 6-52). Service-sector employment is concentrated within six industries: architecture, computer systems design, consulting, management, commercial equipment and services, and R&D. These service industries collectively employed more than four-fifths of workers employed by all small businesses in high-technology service industries in 2004. The manufacturing sector employs most of the remainder of workers in high-technology small businesses (31% in 2004).\nEmployment in manufacturing is similarly concentrated within a relatively small number of industries: motor vehicle parts, metal working, semiconductors, other machinery, fabricated metals, and navigational and measurement tools. These six industries collectively employed more than half of all workers employed by all manufacturing high-technology small businesses and 16% of the entire high-technology small business labor force in 2004.\nFormation of High-Technology Small Businesses\nCorptech has created a database on the formation of high-technology businesses by technology area. Corptech identifies 17 industry areas as high technology (using a classification that is not comparable to the Bureau of Labor Statistics definition of high-technology businesses used in the previous section).56 Formations of U.S. high-technology small businesses sharply increased in the mid-1990s, rising from around 1,000 annually to an annual average of about\n\nTable 6-26 Leading types of employers of high-technology small businesses, by industry: 2004\n\nIndustry\nAll industries ...........................

The most dramatic change was the decline in new telecommunications and Internet-related small businesses. This industry's share from 2003 to 2004 was 6%, which is 20 percentage points lower compared with the period from 2000 to 2002, and down 35 percentage points compared with the period from 1997 to 1999.\nFinancing of High-Technology Small Businesses\nEntrepreneurs seeking to start up or expand a small firm with new or unproven technology may not have access to public or credit-oriented institutional funding. Two types of financing, angel and venture, are often critical to financing nascent and growing high-technology and entrepreneurial businesses. (In this section, business denotes anything from an entrepreneur with an idea to a legally established operating company.)\nAngel investors tend to be wealthy individuals who invest their own funds in entrepreneurial businesses, either individually or through informal networks, usually in exchange for ownership equity. Venture capitalists manage the pooled investments of others, typically wealthy investors, investment banks, and other financial institutions in a professionally managed fund. In return, venture capitalists receive ownership equity and almost always a say in managerial decisions.\nVenture capital firms have categorized their investments into four broad financing stages, which are also relevant for discussion of angel investment:\n\nFigure 6-40 U.S. high-technology small business formation, by share of selected technology areas: 1997\u00ad2004\n\nFactory automation\n\nComputer software\nComputer hardware\nManufacturing e uipment\nSubassemblies and components\nAdvanced materials\nTelecommunications/ Internet\nEnergy\n\n1997\u00ad99 2000\u00ad02 2003\u00ad04\n\nBiotechnology\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nPercent\n\nNOTE: High-technology areas defined by Corporate Technology Information Services, Inc.

Seed funding develops proof of a concept, and startup funding supports product development and initial marketing.\n Early funds provide financing to companies that have exhausted their initial capital and need funds to initiate commercial manufacturing and sales.\n Expansion financing includes working capital for the initial expansion of a company, funds for major growth expansion (involving plant expansion, marketing, or development of an improved product), and financing for a company expecting to go public within 6\u00ad12 months.\n Later-stage funds include acquisition financing and management and leveraged buyouts. Acquisition financing provides resources for the purchase of another company, and a management and leveraged buyout provides funds to enable operating management to acquire a product line or business from either a public or private company.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 6-49\n\nAngel investor funds are concentrated in the seed-startup and early stages. During the period 2005\u00ad06, they provided 92% of investment for these stages compared with 8% in later stages. Venture capital, however, is provided primarily in the expansion and later stages (figure 6-41).\nThis section examines angel and venture capital investment patterns in the United States, focusing on the period from 2001 to the present and examining: (1) changes in the overall level of investment, (2) investment by stage of financing, and (3) the technology areas that U.S. angel and venture capitalists find attractive.\nU.S. Angel Capital Investment\nAccording to data from the Center for Venture Research, angel investors provided $25.6 billion in financing in 2006, an 11% increase compared with 2005 and the fourth consecutive annual increase since 2002 (figure 6-42; appendix table 6-54).57 An estimated 51,000 businesses received financing from angel investors in 2006, 1,500 more compared with 2005, and 3,000 more compared with 2004. The average investment per business from 2004 to 2005 increased from about $470,000 to $500,000 in 2006 (table 6-27).\nAlthough angel investors continue to concentrate on the riskier stages of business development, they have become more conservative in their investment patterns. Slightly more than half of all angel investment financing was seedstartup financing in 2006, down from nearly 60% in 2002\n\nFigure 6-41 Share of angel and venture capital investment, by financing stage: 2005\u00ad06\n\nPercent\n\n100\n\nAngel\n\nVenture\n\ncapital\n\ncapital\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0 Seed-startup and early\n\nExpansion and later\n\nNOTES: Seed-startup includes proof of concept (seed), research, and product development.

See appendix table 6-56.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n(figure 6-43). Conversely, angel investment financing in the early stage grew from 41% to 47% during this period.\nChanges in the technology areas that attract angel investment may indicate changes in the parts of the economy that offer future growth opportunities. Healthcare and medical devices received the largest share of angel investment in 2006 (21%), 5 percentage points higher than its 2004 share (figure 6-44). Biotechnology received 18% of total angel investment in 2006, 8 percentage points higher than its 2004 share. Software also received 18% share of total angel investment during the same period, 4 percentage points lower than its share in 2004.\nBusinesses receiving angel investment in 2006 employed about 200,000 workers. This figure is about the same as employment in 2005, but 60,000 jobs greater compared with the 2004 level (appendix table 6-54). Each business employed an average number of four workers from 2005\u00ad06, up from three workers in 2003.\nU.S. Venture Capital Investment\nU.S. venture capitalists invested $26 billion in 2006, a 14% gain compared with the level in 2005 (figure 6-42; appendix table 6-55). The amounts of angel and venture capital investment have been very similar for the last 5 years. Since declining sharply in 2002 following the end of the dot. com boom, angel and venture capital investment have been strengthening.\nVenture capitalists financed 2,910 firms in 2006, far fewer than the number of businesses financed by angel investors (51,000).

The number of businesses in 2006 was 10% higher than in 2005 and 13% higher than the 2004 level. Average investment per business in 2006 was about $300,000 higher compared with 2005 and 2004, and approximately $750,000 higher compared with 2003.\nLike angel investment, venture capital investment has become generally more conservative and moved toward later stages of business development. As noted previously, the bulk of venture capital is provided for expansion and laterstage financing; from 2002 to 2006 these stages accounted for a combined share of 80% (figure 6-45; appendix table 6-56). Expansion financing has typically been the single largest stage financed by venture capital funds, accounting for approximately half or more of all venture investment\n\nfrom 1996 through 2004. Expansion financing's share, however, declined to 41% between 2005 and 2006. Later-stage investment, on the other hand, more than doubled from 15% during the mid-1990s to 31% from 2002 to 2004, before rising to 39% between 2005 and 2006, a level nearly equal to the share of expansion financing.\nAs the venture capital industry has consolidated, venture capitalists have largely abandoned the seed-startup stage and invested almost exclusively in early, expansion, and later stages. The share of venture capital devoted to seed-startup financing peaked at 19% in 1994 and then declined precipitously, bottoming out just above 1% in 2002 (figure 6-45; appendix table 6-56). Three factors help explain this shift:\n\nFigure 6-43 Angel investment, by share of seed-startup and early activities: 2002\u00ad06\n\nPercent\n\n80\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0 Seed-startup\n\nEarly\n\nNOTES: 2004 data not available.

See appendix table 6-56.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n Investment in early, expansion, and later stages is usually less risky compared with the seed-startup stage.\n Venture capital funds in the 21st century generally have a shorter time horizon for closing out their investments compared with the longer time required by seed-startup investments.\n The amount of investment required for seed-startup is typically below the minimum threshold of venture capital funds.\nIn 2003, however, the percentage of venture capital invested in the seed-startup stage began to inch up, reaching 4% by 2006. This recent increase has been attributed to two factors: the need for venture capitalists to find new investments after closing out their holdings in mature companies and the emergence of promising new opportunities that spurred investment in new businesses (NVCA 2007a).\nVenture Capital Financing by Industry Computer software had the largest share of venture capi-\ntal funding of any industry from 2005 to 2006 (20%), a slight decline compared with 2002\u00ad04 levels (figure 6-46; appendix table 6-55). Biotechnology had the second highest share from 2005 to 2006 (18%), more than triple its share during the period 1999\u00ad2001. The growth in venture capitalist financing of biotechnology parallels rising interest by angel investors (figure 6-44). Communications, which had the largest share between 1999 and 2001, slipped to second place from 2002 to 2004 and fell slightly below biotechnology from 2005 to 2006.

The share of Internet-related companies more than doubled from 35% in 1996 to peak at more than 70% from 1999 to 2000 before falling sharply to a level of about 40% or less in 2004 (appendix table 6-55). Internet-related companies continue to command a substantial share of venture capital, however, especially in several high-technology industries. For example, in 2006, the share of Internet-related companies in the computer software and communications industries exceeded 65% (table 6-28). In retailing and media, Internet-related companies amounted to three-quarters of all companies financed by venture capital. Other sectors have far smaller shares of Internet-related companies, including semiconductors (9%), healthcare (3%), and industrial/energy (1%).\nVenture Capital Investment by U.S. States Venture capital is invested disproportionately in a few\nstates that also perform most of the R&D conducted in the United States and that receive most U.S. patents (table 6-29; appendix table 6-57). California alone received nearly onehalf of total venture capital investment in 2006; its 48% share that year was 8 percentage points higher than its share a decade earlier. Massachusetts has the second highest share of investment (11% in 2006); this share has remained steady\n\n\f6-52 \n\nChapter 6.

The remaining top-10 states receiving venture capital have shares between 2% and 5%. These 10 states collectively account for 86% of total U.S. venture capital investment (see Chapter 8).\nVenture Capital Financing and Employment According to the National Venture Capital Association,\nfirms that received venture financing employed an estimated 10 million workers in 2005, more than half of whom worked in R&D and technology-intensive industries including computer hardware (19%), industrial/energy (12%), financial services (9%), and software (9%) (table 6-30). Two other R&D-intensive industries, which have close ties to scientific research and academia, employed a combined 4% of the workers in venture capital-financed firms. In 2005, employment in firms with venture capital support was 9% higher than in 2003 and 16% higher than 2000 levels (NVCA 2007b).\n\nTable 6-29 Top 10 U.S. states receiving venture capital investment: 1996, 2001, and 2006\n(Percent share)\n\nState\nAll states ($billions) .................................................................................

The U.S. economy has grown relatively rapidly and become more productive while sustaining a high and rising per capita income. The U.S. gap with Asia on many of these measures is narrowing, however, because of rapid progress by China and several other countries. Although the EU's economic position is relatively strong, its market position in S&T industries has either flattened out or slipped.\nThe strong competitive position of the U.S. economy is tied to continued U.S. global leadership in many industries that have extensive ties to S&T. With the service sector increasingly dominating global economic activity, the United States continues to hold the dominant market position in service industries that rely on S&T. The U.S. trading position in technology-oriented services remains strong, as evidenced by the continued U.S. surplus in trade of computer software and manufacturing know-how.\nThe U.S. position in high-technology manufacturing industries, however, is not quite as strong as in services. The United States continues to be a leading innovator and producer in many high-technology manufacturing industries, but the historically strong U.S. trade position has decreased. Although in surplus for the prior two decades, the U.S. trade balance moved to a deficit during the late 1990s because of faster growth of imports, primarily in computer and communications equipment. The U.S. trade balance in advanced-technology goods has similarly moved from surplus to deficit during this period.\nLed by China, South Korea, and Taiwan, Asia is challenging the U.S. market position in S&T industries and reducing the gap on technological innovation. China has rapidly risen to become a leading producer and exporter of high-technology manufacturing goods, as measured by world market share. This rapid ascent shows signs of continuing. South Korea, Taiwan, and other Asian economies have also become leading producers and exporters in S&T-intensive industries.\nVarious patenting indicators suggest that the United States will remain a leader in technological development within its domestic and foreign markets. The leading source of economically valuable patents known as triadic patents, the United States also leads in U.S. patent applications and is the leading foreign source of European patent applications. Asia shows a strengthening of technological development, however; its share of U.S. and European patents has risen markedly, led by Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.\nIn sum, the United States continues to be a world-class competitive and technologically innovative country with a leading position in most high-technology industries. Several Asian economies, however, including China, South Korea, Taiwan, and India, have become global players in some high-technology industries, and their technological capabilities are strengthening. The EU, on the other hand, has lost market share in high-technology industries.\n\nNotes\n1. Educating a workforce that can fully participate in an S&T-oriented economy is critical to its success. Three chapters of this report track trends in education: Elementary and Secondary Education (chapter 1), Higher Education in Science and Engineering (chapter 2), and Science and Engineering Labor Force (chapter 3).\n2. This chapter presents data from various public and private sources. Consequently, the countries included vary by data source.\n3. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) estimates that treating R&D as an investment increased the level of current-dollar GDP by an average of 2.5% per year during the period 1959 to 2002 (Okubo et al. 2006). The BEA estimate measures the direct impact of R&D and does not include the indirect (spillover) impact of R&D.\n4. GDP per capita does not reveal anything about comparative distribution of income across countries, for which data are not readily available.\n5. Extensive literature exists on the impact of IT on U.S. economic growth in the mid-1990s. For example, see Stiroh K 2001. What drives productivity growth? Economic Policy Review 7(1):39\u00ad59; http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/ epr/01v07n1/0103stir.html. Accessed 26 June 2007.\n6. See OECD (2001) for discussion of classifying economic activities according to degree of \"knowledge intensity.\"\n7. In designating these high-technology manufacturing industries, OECD took into account both the R&D done directly by firms and R&D embedded in purchased inputs (indirect R&D) for 13 countries: the United States, Japan, Germany, France, the UK, Canada, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Ireland. Direct intensities were calculated as the ratio of R&D expenditure to output (production) in 22 industrial sectors. Each sector was weighted according to its share of the total output among the 13 countries, using purchasing power parities as exchange rates. Indirect intensities were calculated using the technical coefficients of industries on the basis of input-output matrices. OECD then assumed that, for a given type of input and for all groups of products, the proportions of R&D expenditure embodied in value added remained constant. The inputoutput coefficients were then multiplied by the direct R&D intensities. For further details concerning the methodology used, see OECD (2001). It should be noted that several nonmanufacturing industries have equal or greater R&D intensities. For additional perspectives on OECD's methodology, see Godin B. 2004. The new economy: What the concept owes to the OECD. Research Policy 33:679\u00ad90.\n8. Data are extracted from the Global Insight World Industry Service database, which provides information for 70 countries that account for more than 97% of global economic activity. The Global Insight data on international country activity within the service and manufacturing industries are expressed in 2000 constant dollars. Constant dollar data for foreign countries are calculated by deflating industry data valued in each country's nominal currency.\n\n\f6-54 \n\nChapter 6. Industry, Technology, and the Global Marketplace\n\n9. Compared with the extensive data available for the manufacturing industries, national data that track activity in many rapidly growing service sectors are limited in the level of industry aggregation and types of data collected. For example, export and import data are currently not available for many services.\n10. Gross revenue includes inputs or supplies purchased from other industries or services. Knowledge-intensive service and high-technology manufacturing industry data are expressed in 2000 constant dollars. Constant-dollar data for foreign countries is calculated by deflating nominal domestic currency with a sector-specific price index constructed for that country, then converting the result to U.S. dollars based on average annual market exchange rates.\n11. Asia is defined in this section as consisting of China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. China includes Hong Kong.\n12. One of the earliest quantitative analyses of R&D was done in 1955 by R.H. Ewell, supported by the National Science Foundation. This study showed a definite correlation between research and productivity. Also see Godin B. 2004. The obsession for competitiveness and its impact on statistics: The construction of high-technology indicators. Research Policy 33:1217\u00ad29.\n13. This conclusion is derived from an examination of weighted U.S. data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Employment Survey concerning average annual pay during the period 1997\u00ad2001.\n14. Global Insight's data show that U.S. high-technology industry manufacturers' share of value added to total output was 20% higher than the share of all other U.S. manufacturing industries.\n15. This conclusion is derived from an examination of weighted U.S. data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Employment Survey on average annual pay from 1997\u00ad2001.\n16. Europe's success in growing its aerospace industry and China's efforts to develop a semiconductor industry are two examples.\n17. In February 1996, the Telecommunications Act became U.S. law. This Act was the first major telecommunications reform in more than 60 years. It facilitated competition between cable companies and telephone companies and may have contributed to increased U.S. manufacturing activity in both the communications and computer hardware industries.\n18. In 1999, the State Department's responsibilities under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation were expanded to include research activity formerly covered under the Commerce Department's export regulations. The transfer placed scientific satellites, related data, and certain computer components and software on the U.S. Munitions List. Related research activities and the country of origin of researchers working on related research activities also became\n\nsubject to many of the same regulations controlling exports of sensitive products.\n19. Like the United States, other national governments usually have strong ties to their aerospace industries, often supporting and funding R&D and serving as major customers.\n20. Unlike the previous section that examined data on industry manufacturing value added (domestic content), the value of exports reported in this section reflects the final value of industry shipments exported, not just the value resulting from domestic production. Exported shipments will, therefore, often include the value of purchased foreign inputs.\n21. EU exports exclude intra-EU exports. 22. The U.S. trade balance is affected by many other factors including currency fluctuations, differing fiscal and monetary policies, and export subsidies between the United States and its trading partners. 23. U.S. trade in software products is not a separate National Institute of Standards and Technology Advanced Technology Program (ATP) category in the official statistics but is included in the ATP category covering information and communications products. For this report, trade in software products is examined separately, in effect creating an 11th category (see figure 6-23). 24. The U.S. dollar rose against other major currencies in the late 1990s and continued to rise until early 2002. The sharp rise in the dollar was a contributing factor in the broadbased decline in exports by U.S. manufacturers from 2000 to 2003. The U.S. export decline was also affected by slower rates of GDP growth experienced by some U.S. trading partners during that time, including the EU and Japan. 25. Data on U.S. trade balance in advanced technology products during the 1990s is available at appendix table 6-3 in volume 2 of NSB (2002), accessible at http://www.nsf. gov/statistics/seind02/append/c6/at06-03.pdf. 26. The U.S. government and U.S. corporations have long advocated the establishment and protection of intellectual property rights. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative monitors countries with reported violations and reports on the status of intellectual property protection in its annual report, Foreign Trade Barriers. 27. An affiliate refers to a business enterprise located in one country that is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by an entity in another country. The controlling interest for an incorporated business is 10% or more of its voting stock; for an unincorporated business, it is an interest equal to 10% of voting stock. 28. In addition, data on the destination of multinational corporate sales to foreign affiliates also suggest that market access is an important factor in the firms' decisions to locate production abroad. See Borga and Mann (2004). 29. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), the source of U.S. royalty and fees data, collects data on the following Asian countries/economies: China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 6-55\n\nKorea, Taiwan, Thailand, and other unspecified Asian countries. See BEA (2007).\n30. Asia has purchased more manufacturing know-how than the EU since 1987, the first year data were collected on manufacturing know-how. See BEA (2007).\n31. See chapter 2 for a discussion of international higher education trends and chapter 4 for a discussion of trends in U.S. R&D.\n32. For details on survey and indicator construction, see Porter et al. (2005).\n33. For information on the validity and reliability testing the indicators have undergone, see Porter et al. (2001, 2005) and Roessner, Porter, and Xu (1992).\n34. These articles are identified by at least one author having a private, for-profit institutional address.\n35. In this section, article counts were reported on a fractional-count basis. In the following section's discussion of collaboration trends, articles are reported on a whole-count basis. See the sidebar \"Bibliometric Data and Terminology\" in chapter 5 for a description of these methods of counting articles and how they are generally used.\n36. In contrast to the decline in emphasis on basic research in industry publications, about one-third of U.S. publications overall were published in basic research journals from 1988 to 2005.\n37. All addresses for a company and its subsidiaries are unified into a single code for the parent company.\n38. Other U.S. sectors in which researchers produced articles are academia, the federal government, state and local governments, federally funded R&D centers, and the private nonprofit sector.\n39. The base for the percentages discussed in this section is the number of industry articles with one or more industry authors minus the number of single company articles.\n40. Rather than granting property rights to the inventor as is the practice in the United States and many other countries, some countries grant property rights to the applicant, which may be a corporation or other organization.\n41. U.S. patent law states that any person who \"invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent.\" The law defines \"nonobvious\" as \"sufficiently different from what has been used or described before [so] that it may be said to be nonobvious to a person having ordinary skill in the area of technology related to the invention.\" These terms are part of the criteria in U.S. patent law. For more information, see USPTO, \"What is a patent?\" at http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/index. html#patent, accessed 28 June 2007.\n42. Although the USPTO grants several types of patents, this discussion is limited to utility patents, commonly known as patents for inventions. They include any new, useful, or improved-on method, process, machine, device, manufactured item, or chemical compound.\n\n43. The Japan Patent Office (JPO) is also a major patent office but has much smaller share of foreign patents compared with the USPTO and EPO.\n44. USPTO reports that average time to process an application (pendancy) was 31.1 months for utility, plant, and reissue patent applications in FY 2006, compared with 18.3 months in FY 2003. Applications for utility patents account for the overwhelming majority of these requests. The EPO reports that the average pendancy was 45.3 months in 2005.\n45. Unless otherwise noted, USPTO patents are assigned to countries on the basis of the residence of the first-named inventor.\n46. U.S. patenting data on type of ownership and by state is available only for U.S. patents granted.\n47. Some of the decline in U.S. patenting by inventors from the EU and other leading industrialized nations may be because of movement toward European unification, which has encouraged wider patenting within Europe.\n48. EPO patents are assigned to countries on a fractionalcount basis. For patents with inventors from different countries, each country receives credit on basis of proportion of its participating inventors.\n49. The data source for EPO and USPTO patents is the OECD. USPTO data drawn from the OECD database are not directly comparable with data reported by the USPTO because of methodological differences and consequent OECD adjustments.\n50. A seminal court decision opening the floodgate for biotechnology-related patents is the 1980 Supreme Court decision Diamond v. Chakrabarty, which ruled that genetically engineered living organisms can be patented.\n51. The EU issued a directive that harmonized the laws of member states on biotechnology patenting, which may explain the lag and subsequent growth of EU biotechnology patents compared with the United States.\n52. The database is housed at the OECD and produced as a collaborative project among the OECD, the National Science Foundation, the EU, the World Intellectual Property Organization, the USPTO, the JPO, and the EPO. Until March 2001, only patents granted in the United States were published in the database. Technically, the dataset counts those inventions for which patent protection is sought in Europe and Japan and obtained in the United States.\n53. Triadic patent families with coinventors residing in different countries are assigned to their respective countries on a fractional count basis. Patents are listed by priority year, which is the year of the first patent filing. Data for 1998\u00ad2003 are estimated by the OECD.\n54. The high-technology definition used here is from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and differs from that used in earlier sections.\n55. See Hecker (2005) for their definition and methodology for determining high-technology industries.

About four of five surveyed said they had checked on the reliability of information at least once.\nSurveys have long shown that most Americans express substantial interest in S&T. However, other indicators suggest a lower level of interest.\n In surveys conducted annually from 2001 to 2006, between 83% and 87% of Americans said they had \"a lot\" or \"some\" interest in new scientific discoveries.\n Survey data indicate that, relative to other topics, interest in S&T is not particularly high. However, some topics that rank higher than S&T, such as new medical discoveries, include extensive S&T content.\n As with many news topics, the percentage of Americans who say they follow S&T news closely has declined over the past 10 years, but S&T's decline has been more pronounced.\n Recent surveys indicate that elsewhere in the world, including Japan and Europe, public interest in S&T is lower than in the United States. China is a notable exception.\n In 2006, about three of five Americans said they had visited an informal science institution, such as a zoo or museum, in the past year. This proportion is generally consistent with results from surveys conducted since 1979.\nPublic Knowledge About S&T\nMany Americans do not give correct answers to basic factual questions about science and questions about the scientific inquiry process.\n Americans'factual knowledge about science has not changed much over time. Factual knowledge is positively related to level of formal schooling, income level, and number of science and math courses taken.\n People who score well on long-standing survey questions that test for information typically learned in school also appear to know more about nanotechnology and the Earth's\n\npolar regions, topics that historically have not been central to the standardized content of American science education.\n Levels of factual knowledge of science in the United States are comparable with those in Europe and appear to be better than those in Japan, China, or Russia.\n Americans' understanding of the scientific process appears to have improved slightly in recent years. Their level of understanding is strongly associated with factual knowledge of science and with level of education.\nU.S. scores on questions about the theory of evolution and the \"big bang\" are lower than those in other countries, and many Americans are receptive to including nonscientific views in science classrooms.\n Many Americans appear skeptical of established scientific ideas in these areas, even when they have some basic familiarity with them.\n Americans' responses to questions about evolution have remained virtually unchanged over the past 25 years.\n More Americans approved than disapproved of instruction about three explanations of the origins of life (evolution, intelligent design, and creationism) in public school science classes. However, many were unsure.\nPublic Attitudes About S&T in General\nAmericans consistently and by large margins endorse the past achievements and future promise of S&T. This support has been evident in surveys conducted since 1979.\n In 2006, more than half of Americans said that the benefits of scientific research have strongly outweighed the harmful results, and only 6% said the harms slightly or strongly outweighed the benefits. Other indicators yield similar results.\n Americans' positive attitudes about S&T cross demographic boundaries: men and women, college graduates and high school dropouts, and blacks and whites all express support.\n Americans also express some reservations about S&T. A majority agree that \"scientific research these days doesn't pay enough attention to the moral values of society,\" although the proportion agreeing dropped substantially in annual surveys between 2001 and 2006. Nearly half believe that science makes life change too fast.\n Attitudes about the benefits of S&T are somewhat more favorable in the United States than in Europe, Russia, and Japan. Attitudes in China and South Korea, however, are comparable with and perhaps even more favorable than those in the United States.\n\n\f7-4 \n\nChapter 7. Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding\n\nSupport for government funding of scientific research is strong and growing.\n In 2006, 87% of Americans expressed support for government funding of basic research, up from levels around 80% in past surveys dating back to 1979.\n The percentage of Americans who said that the government spends too little on scientific research grew from 34% to 41% between 2002 and 2006.\n Other kinds of federal spending, however, generate even stronger public support.\nThe public consistently expresses confidence in science leaders.\n In 2006, more Americans expressed a great deal of confidence in leaders of the scientific community than in the leaders of any other institution except the military. Despite a general decline in confidence in institutional leaders since the early 1970s, confidence in science leaders has remained relatively consistent.\n On science-related public policy issues (including global climate change, stem cell research, and genetically modified foods), Americans believe that science leaders, compared with leaders in other sectors, are relatively knowledgeable and impartial and should be relatively influential. However, they also perceive a significant lack of consensus among scientists on these issues.\nIn deciding whether a study is scientific, most Americans rely on criteria related to the research process: whether results are evidence based, carefully interpreted, and replicated.\n Research process characteristics are especially important among more highly educated Americans, who are less likely than others to rely on other criteria such as researchers' credentials, institutional settings, and consistency with common sense or with religious beliefs.\n Americans and Europeans both see medicine as more scientific than other fields, with physics and biology following close behind it.\nPublic Attitudes About Specific S&T Issues\nAmericans have recently become more concerned about environmental quality.\n In 2007, 43% of Americans expressed strong concern about the environment, up from 35% in 2005. However, concern about the environment ranks somewhere in the middle among 12 issues.\n Global warming has recently become more prominent among environmental issues of concern to the public, although it still ranks 8th among 10 issues.\n\nMany Americans are unfamiliar with emerging technologies and research topics, and many have significant misconceptions about them.\n Few Americans (about 1 in 10) consider themselves \"very familiar\" with biotechnology.\n Most Americans (60%) believe they have not eaten genetically modified foods, although in fact processed foods commonly contain genetically modified ingredients.\n More than half of Americans (54%) have heard \"nothing at all\" about nanotechnology.\n Most Americans say they are \"not very clear\" (35%) or \"not clear at all\" (35%) about the distinction between reproductive and therapeutic cloning.\nA majority of Americans support medical research that uses stem cells from human embryos. However, Americans are wary of innovations using cloning technology, and they overwhelmingly oppose reproductive cloning.\n In three surveys conducted between 2004 and 2006, a majority agreed with the statement that it was more important to continue with stem cell research than to avoid destroying human embryos used in the research.\n About half of Americans oppose using human cloning technology even if it is limited to helping medical research develop new treatments for disease.\n Four of five Americans oppose using \"cloning technology to produce a child.\"\nAmericans, Europeans, and Canadians share similarly favorable attitudes about biotechnology and nanotechnology.\n In 2005, 71% of Americans and 67% of Canadians expressed support for products and processes involving biotechnology. Almost two-thirds of Europeans said they expected biotechnology to positively affect their way of life in the next 20 years.\n When told about nanotechnology, about half of Americans surveyed in 2005 foresaw substantial or some benefit from it, and 14% expected substantial or some risk. Canadian response to the same question was similar. Among Europeans, 48% expected positive effects from nanotechnology, whereas only 8% expected negative effects.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 7-5\n\nIntroduction\nChapter Overview\nIn today's America, science and technology (S&T) are everywhere. Americans encounter S&T in their roles as citizens, workers, and consumers. As citizens, they vote for candidates with different views about global warming, stem cell research, and deficit spending, issues about which atmospheric scientists, microbiologists, and macroeconomists claim expertise. As workers, they compete for jobs in technology-driven sectors of the economy that did not exist a generation ago, where familiarity with recently invented devices and emerging scientific disciplines makes them more competitive. As consumers, in their leisure time, they rely on new technologies to entertain themselves, build relationships with others, and keep informed about the world around them.\nIt is increasingly difficult for Americans to be competent as citizens, workers, and consumers without some degree of competence in dealing with S&T. Because competence begins with understanding, this chapter presents indicators of how Americans get S&T news and information and how much they know about S&T. How the American citizenry collectively deals with public issues that centrally involve S&T in turn affects whether America will continue to be a fertile environment for developing scientific knowledge and applying it in practical contexts. It also affects the kinds of S&T development America will support. The chapter therefore includes indicators of attitudes about S&T-related issues. Because citizens often rely on trusted leaders to shape their attitudes on contested issues, the chapter includes indicators of public perceptions concerning the influence scientific experts ought to have on S&T-related policies.\nIndicators of what Americans know and think concerning S&T may be considered in two essentially different ways. They may be compared to a benchmark that suggests what people ought to know or how they ought to apply their knowledge. These indicators may also be compared with similar indicators for past years or other countries. In an increasingly globalized world, international comparisons become increasingly relevant: a culture in which S&T flourish can give a country a competitive advantage, and public understanding of and support for S&T are components of such a culture.\nChapter Organization\nThe chapter is divided into four major sections. The first includes indicators of the public's sources of information about, level of interest in, and active involvement with S&T. This section contains data on public use of the mass media for science news and information and on involvement with informal science in museums, science centers, zoos, and aquariums. The second section of the chapter reports on indicators of public knowledge, including measures of factual knowledge and understanding of the scientific process. The third and fourth sections of the chapter are about attitudes toward S&T. The third section contains data on attitudes about S&T in general, including support for government funding\n\nof basic research, confidence in the leadership of the scientific community, perceptions of the prestige of S&E as occupations, and opinions about how much influence science and scientists ought to have in public affairs. The fourth section addresses attitudes on specific S&T-related issues. It includes indicators of public opinion about several emerging lines of research and new technologies, including biotechnology, genetically modified food, nanotechnology, stem cell research, and cloning.\nA Note About the Data\nThroughout, the chapter emphasizes trends over time, patterns of variation within the U.S. population, and international patterns. It gives less weight to the specific percentages of survey respondents who gave particular answers to the questions posed to them. Although, inevitably, the chapter reports these percentages, they are subject to numerous sources of error and should be treated with caution. Caution is especially warranted for data from surveys that omit significant portions of the target population, have low response rates, for which significant methodological information is unavailable, and have topics that are particularly sensitive to subtle differences in question wording (see sidebar, \"Survey Data Sources\"). In contrast to specific percentages, consistent and substantial trends and patterns warrant greater confidence. However, international comparisons, where language and cultural differences affect how respondents interpret questions and can introduce numerous complexities, also require special care.\nInformation Sources, Interest, and Involvement\nBecause S&T are relevant to so many aspects of daily life, information about S&T can help Americans make better decisions and develop more confidence in their ability to make sense of the world around them. In addition to opening up avenues to the intrinsic satisfactions that S&T offer, interest in and involvement with S&T can be paths to acquiring more information and achieving greater understanding.\nS&T Information Sources\nU.S. Patterns and Trends More Americans get most of their information about cur-\nrent news events from television than any other source. About half report television as their main information source, with substantial percentages reporting newspapers (23%) and the Internet (14%) as their main source (appendix table 7-1). These figures have not changed substantially since 2004 (NSB 2006). Marked changes in media use for current news occurred throughout the 1990s, including rapid growth in Internet use and sharp declines in regular local and network news viewership and in newspaper readership. However, these trends appear to have slowed or stopped in recent years (Pew Research Center for the People and the Press 2006a).\n\n\f7-6 \n\nChapter 7.

For both kinds of information, more Americans select television as their primary source than any other medium. Unlike for current news, though, the Internet is the second most common primary source of S&T information, and its margin over other sources is large and growing. The Internet, magazines, and books or other printed material loom larger as primary information sources for S&T than for current news; the opposite is true for television, newspapers, and radio (figure 7-2).\n\nTo learn about specific scientific issues, over half of Americans choose the Internet as their main information source (figure 7-1; appendix table 7-3). Television (19%) is the only other medium that more than 10% of Americans choose as their primary source. Considering that about one-fourth of Americans lack access to the Internet at home or work (Harris Interactive 2006c), the overall proportion who rely on it for specific S&T information is especially noteworthy. However, presumably because of limited access, the percentage of Americans who say they ever get science information from the Internet is lower than the comparable figures for television, newspapers, or magazines (Horrigan 2006).\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 7-7\n\nSurvey Data Sources--continued\n\nSponsoring\n\nPrimary topic organization\n\nTitle\n\nInformation sources, interest, and involvement\n\nPew Research Center for the People and the Press\n\nBiennial News Consumption Survey\n\nYears used\n1996\u00ad 2006\n\nInformation used Information, interest\n\nData collection method\nRDD\n\nPublic attitudes in general\n\nPew Research Center News Interest Index for the People and the Press\n\nPew Internet and American Life Project\n\nPew Internet and American Life Project Survey\n\nUSC Annenberg\n\nSurveying the Digital Future\n\nSchool Center for the\n\nDigital Future\n\nInstitute of Museum and Library Services\n\nInterConnections: The IMLS national study on the use of libraries, museums, and the Internet\n\nUniversity of Chicago, National Opinion Research Center\n\nGeneral Social Survey\n\n2002\u00ad 06\n2006\n2000\u00ad 06\n2006\n1973\u00ad 2006\n\nInformation, interest\nInformation, interest, involvement Internet use\nInvolvement\nGovernment spending, confidence in institutional leaders\n\nRDD RDD RDD RDD Face-to-face interviews\n\nPublic attitudes about specific issues\n\nHarris Interactive\n\nThe Harris Poll\n\nPew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology\n\nVarious ongoing surveys\n\n1977\u00ad 2006\n2006\n\nOccupational prestige, Internet use\nBiotechnology, genetically modified foods\n\nRDD RDD\n\nResearch!America Public Agenda\n\nVarious ongoing surveys\n\n2005\n\nReality check 2006: Are parents and students ready for more math and science?

One possibility, consonant with the idea that the lengthy narrative in printed materials facilitates in-depth analysis of complex issues, is that Americans are increasingly seeking relatively brief and convenient overviews of such issues. This interpretation is consistent with data on recent trends in news consumption, which indicate that availability of Internet\n\nnews has not increased overall news consumption and that Internet news users more often look for quick updates on the Web than for detailed information (Pew Research Center for the People and the Press 2006a). There are other possibilities, however. For example, because America's media environment is increasingly segmented, the assumption that a particular information source provides a particular kind or quality of information is becoming increasingly problematic. Thus television includes a range of science-related material, presented in specialized programs (e.g., Nova) and channels (e.g., the Science Channel) that cater to people with a sustained interest in science; outlets (e.g., news magazines) that offer occasional, ordinarily reliable scientific information; and even entertainment programs that indiscriminately\n\n\f7-8 \n\nChapter 7.

Other media also present heterogeneous content. By this interpretation, then, a user who moves from magazines to television may be doing it for a variety of reasons and is not necessarily choosing information of lesser quality.\nIn general, people who rely more on television for news and information, including S&T information, tend to be older and have fewer years of education than those who rely on the Internet and other sources (appendix tables 7-1 and 7-2). Access to high-speed Internet connections is also associated with more extensive reliance on the Internet for news and information (Cole 2005; Horrigan 2006).\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 7-9\n\nPerhaps because S&T information is not easily separable from the general flow of information in the mass media, national data that address the processes through which Americans acquire and sort through such information are scarce. A Pew Internet and American Life Project survey (Horrigan 2006) probed how Americans use the Internet to acquire information about science. It found that a clear majority of Internet users had engaged in some information search activities, including \"look up the meaning of a particular scientific term or concept\" (70%), \"look for an answer to a question you have about a scientific concept or theory\" (68%), and \"learn more about a science story or scientific discovery you first heard or read about offline\" (65%). In addition, just over half had used the Internet to \"complete a science assignment for school, either for yourself or for a child\" (55%) or \"check the accuracy of a scientific fact or statistic\" (52%). Fewer had used the Internet to \"download scientific data, graphs or charts\" (43%) or \"compare different or opposing scientific theories\" (37%). How skillfully or how often Americans engage in the search for scientific information, whether on the Internet or elsewhere, remains unknown.\nUsing information well involves more than finding it. In an information-saturated society, Americans need to make critical assessments of the information they encounter and somehow determine whether it is credible.\nSurvey data provide some indications of how Americans assess the credibility of public information. For the past two decades, Americans have been becoming more skeptical of the information they encounter in the major broadcast and print media generally, although this trend has leveled off somewhat recently (Pew Research Center for the People and the Press 2006a). Americans' judgments of media credibility appear to be shaped by more than their critical thinking skills and the quality of the information provided. For example, judgments of the credibility of particular mass media information sources are associated with political party affiliations (Pew Research Center 2005; Pew Research Center for the People and the Press 2006a). (For data on perceived credibility of biotechnology information sources, see section on \"Biotechnology and Its Medical Applications.\")\nCompared with survey results on the credibility of the major broadcast and print media, data on the credibility of Internet information suggest greater public confidence, most likely because the survey questions are asked in a context that makes respondents think of information that is neither value laden nor controversial.3 For example, a majority of Internet users considered most or all online information to be accurate and reliable. In a survey on Internet use, approximately three-quarters of Internet users rate government websites and websites associated with established print and broadcast media as reliable (Cole 2006). These same established media fare less well in survey contexts that are more likely to invite respondents to ponder the reliability of politically sensitive information in the media (Pew Research Center for the People and the Press 2006a).\n\nEvidence about how Americans judge the credibility of S&T information in the media is scant. Pew's study of how Americans acquire science information indicates that Internet users who seek science information online do not always assume that the information they find there is accurate (Horrigan 2006). Eighty percent report that they have \"ever\" done at least one of the following kinds of checks:\n Compare it to other information you find online to make sure it's correct (62%)\n Compare it to an offline source like a science journal or encyclopedia (54%)\n Look up the original source of the information or the original study it's based on (54%)\nIt is natural to assume that people's choice of media sources affects how they think about S&T. However, it is difficult to design research that clearly isolates the effects of the media and establishes causal linkages. One reason is that people's preexisting opinions and orientations are likely to affect their media choices; another is that media content often affects people indirectly, filtered through the views of trusted friends and relatives (see sidebar, \"Media Effects\").\nInternational Comparisons Data collected between 2001 and 2004 on sources of S&T\ninformation used by people in other countries, including the European Union (EU) states, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and China, uniformly identify television as the leading source of S&T news and information. Newspapers generally ranked second. Relatively few survey respondents cited the Internet as an important source of S&T information, perhaps in part because many lacked access to the Internet. However, national differences in how questions were asked make precise comparisons among different countries impossible. In a 2006 South Korean survey, more respondents named the Internet (23%) as their primary source of S&T information than named newspapers (16%) (Korea Gallup 2007). More recent data on the other countries do not exist; further details on these older data are presented in the 2006 edition of Science and Engineering Indicators (NSB 2006).\nTelevision is also the dominant source of S&T information in India, where about two-thirds of survey respondents in 2004 said it was their main information source (Shukla 2005). Radio (13%) and friends/relatives (12%) ranked ahead of written sources such as newspapers, books, and magazines, which together accounted for 9% of responses. India's relatively low literacy rate (144th of 176 countries in a 2005 ranking) is useful context for these findings.\n\n\f7-10 \n\nChapter 7. Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding\n\nMedia Effects\n\nCitizens of economically advanced societies live in a world that is permeated by mass media of communication. A large social science literature probes how these media operate, what kinds of messages they send, how they tailor their messages to reach different audience segments, and how those messages relate to public opinion. Mass media messages interact with the opinions of the American public in complex ways, and teasing out the reciprocal effects is complicated (Perse 2001).\nProviders of media content are not free to supply whatever content they prefer. In making content decisions, the people who own and manage media organizations take into account the views of the segments of the public that purchase their products and are well aware that their audiences can select other content providers. Likewise, the journalists who gather information and report stories for mass media transmission, whatever their personal views, are guided by the standards of the organizations for which they work and the professions in which they are trained. In addition, they are typically motivated by the desire to make an impact on a large audience by presenting stories in compelling and dramatic ways.\nAt the same time, the mass media do not simply reflect the public they serve. Members of the public are dependent on mass media for much of their information about public issues, either through direct exposure or second hand from friends and relatives. Because Americans tend to rely on sources of information that typically adopt a perspective akin to their own, the ways trusted mass media pose new or less familiar issues can assume great importance. Moreover, even for members of the public who search out multiple points of view on an issue, the shared terms and assumptions in the media shape how they think about issues. Interested parties, including newsmakers, are increasingly sophisticated in crafting messages to capture media attention and appeal to the public.\nStudies that seek to isolate the effects of mass media face numerous challenges:\n Laboratory research, which can control for factors other than media exposure that influence people's opinions, has an uncertain relationship to real world situations, in which people choose media programs, interpret media messages through conversations with others, and pay varying degrees of attention to what is said in the mass media. It is difficult to recreate these conditions in laboratories.\n Even when research can demonstrate short-term effects of media exposure, it is hard to know how much these persist over time or affect behavior in natural settings.\n People interpret a media message differently depending on the beliefs they bring to it and the attention they give it. Thus, media messages may affect individuals, but, because the effects are not uniform and can run in opposite directions, aggregate opinion may be left almost unchanged.\n\n Media messages may have more to do with motivating people who already hold an opinion to become more active in civic and political contexts than with persuading people to adopt new opinions. Surveys may have difficulty capturing this kind of effect.\n In a society with multiple sources of media content, even highly influential media sources, such as programs on major television networks, reach only a fraction of the population and, at any given time, change the perspectives of only a fraction of the people they reach.\n Mass media messages are significantly shaped by events--what is actually taking place in the situations about which they are reporting. Although facts are open to various interpretations and presentations, they set limits beyond which media organizations cannot go without losing credibility.\n It is easy to demonstrate correlations between media content and shifts in public opinion, but hard to demonstrate causation. Sometimes, changes in media content reflect changes in elite opinion or actual circumstances, rather than changes initiated or caused by the mass media themselves.\n Media exposure may have threshold effects, in which a certain amount of repetition is necessary for a message to get through, but beyond that amount further repetition has little or no impact. Compared with effects that work incrementally, threshold effects are harder to isolate.\nRecent research in communications has stressed the role of the mass media in shaping the agenda for public debate and political action (agenda-setting) and the terms in which the public sees an issue (framing) (Scheufele and Tewksbury 2007). Agenda-setting works largely through making a topic more salient and accessible to memory by frequent or more prominent mention of it, thereby increasing the public's sense that the topic is important. Framing refers to ways that mass media construct stories to make a topic comprehensible and relevant to the public. Frames stress some aspects of a topic and minimize others. Some kind of framing is necessary to reduce complexity and provide a focus to make sense of what would otherwise be undigested facts. Interested parties vie to get the mass media to present topics in their preferred frames. Research on how S&T are discussed in the mass media has identified competing frames that have been used to present contested issues (Gamson and Modigliani 1989; Nisbet and Lewenstein 2002). Recognizing that most members of the public pay limited attention to S&T information, some researchers have argued that representatives of the scientific community need to do more to influence how the mass media frame issues (Nisbet and Mooney 2007; Scheufele 2006). In their view, when it comes to influencing public opinion, influencing the frames through which the public processes and understands science-related issues may be more important than increasing the scientific and technical content of news coverage.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\nPublic Interest in S&T\nU.S. Patterns and Trends In surveys, Americans consistently express high levels of\ninterest in S&T. Asked in 2006 whether \"I enjoy learning about science and new science discoveries\" describes them, about three-fourths of Americans said it describes them either very (43%) or somewhat (31%) well (Horrigan 2006). Likewise, in six annual surveys conducted between 2001 and 2006, between 83% and 87% of Americans reported that they had either \"a lot\" or \"some\" interest in new scientific discoveries, with the remaining small minority expressing less interest (table 7-1). In 2006, 47% claimed they had \"a lot\" of interest. More highly educated people tend to express greater interest in S&T (Pew Research Center for the People and the Press 2004).\nHigh levels of expressed interest in S&T are part of a long-standing pattern, evidenced in the results of 11 National Science Foundation (NSF) surveys conducted between 1979 and 2001 (NSB 2002). In each survey, more than 80% of Americans reported that they were either \"very\" or \"moderately\" interested in \"new scientific discoveries\" and \"new inventions and technologies.\"\nHowever, the NSF surveys also give reason to doubt the strength and depth of Americans' interest in S&T. Relative to interest in other topics, interest in S&T in these surveys was not particularly high. S&T interest ranked in the middle among the 10 areas frequently listed in the surveys: above space exploration, international and foreign policy, and agriculture and farming; below new medical discoveries, local schools, and environmental pollution; and similar to economic and business conditions and military and defense policy. Of course, a more inclusive concept of S&T might treat several of the topics in this list, such as space exploration and new medical discoveries, as part of the S&T category; furthermore, other topics often include substantial S&T content (see sidebar, \"What Are Science and Technology?\").\nSurvey responses about S&T news also raise questions about how interested Americans are in S&T in general. For 10 years, Pew (Pew Research Center for the People and the Press 2006a) has collected data on categories of news that Americans follow \"very closely.\" In 2006, S&T news was followed closely by 15% of the public and ranked 10th among 14 topics, ahead of only business and finance, entertainment, consumer news, and culture and the arts (table 7-2). As is the case for many other news topics, the percentage of Americans who say they follow S&T closely has declined over this period. But S&T's decline has been more pronounced, with the result that its relative standing in the list of topics has also slipped over the decade: whereas S&T ranked ahead of seven topics in 1996, three of these had surpassed it by 2002 and have remained ahead since then.\nAmong regular newspaper readers, articles on \"health and medicine\" and \"technology\" rank relatively high as portions of the newspaper that Americans spend \"some time\" or \"a lot of\" time reading (table 7-3). Data on these topics might\n\n 7-11\n\nTable 7-1 Public interest in new scientific discoveries: 2001\u00ad06\n(Percent)\n\nLevel of interest\nA lot .................... Some ..................

Ordinary language rests on the assumption that terms such as these, even if their precise meanings are not quite the same for everyone, invoke a bundle of associations that are similar enough to enable people to communicate. Survey research gathers attitude data about how people respond to the ill-defined linguistic bundles, such as S&T, that people use in ordinary conversation.\nFor purposes of analysis and comparison, research studies usually classify topics in the news in a way that makes space, environment, and health and medicine separate from S&T. The meaning respondents ascribe to a topic category, such as S&T, is affected by the context in which it appears and the other categories listed with it.\nIn interpreting survey data that use these terms, it is important to take into account the uncertainties surrounding the meaning of S&T. For example, it is not clear how often survey respondents who are asked about \"science and technology\" think they are being asked about two separate entities about which they might have different interests or attitudes, rather than about a single complex whole. Likewise, although engineers often think of technology as a broad category of devices and systems that humans construct to solve problems and interact with their environments, there is some evidence that for many people the term technology refers more narrowly to electronic information technology, especially computers (Cunningham, Lachapelle, and Lindgren-Streicher 2005; Rose and Dugger 2002).\n\n\f7-12 \n\nChapter 7.

Conversely, interest in these topics may be limited to information that is immediately related to personal and family well-being or news about computer technology. The available data do not indicate how survey respondents themselves define the focus or scope of their interest.4\nSince 1986, the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press has maintained a news interest index that tracks individual stories that make headlines. The index is based on frequent surveys that record the proportion of Americans who, when asked about a news story, say they are following it \"very closely.\" Stories that attract considerable public interest are often included in several surveys, and results from each survey appear separately several times on the news interest index. For 2002\u00ad06, high gasoline prices, the impact of hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and debates on the war in Iraq comprise all but one of the top 20 items on the list (the Washington, DC area sniper shootings was the other item) (Pew Research Center for the People and the Press 2007a). If S&T content were what generated sustained high levels of public interest in a news story, a different set of stories would be at the top of the list.\nHowever, top stories may not be the best indicator of public interest and exposure. S&T stories rarely feature the evolving human drama of wars and disasters or the immediate personal effects of gasoline prices, making it harder for them to capture widespread and sustained attention in the population at large. It is safe to say that all of the top stories at times focused public attention on S&T issues and that Amer-\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 7-13\n\nicans who had a sounder understanding of S&T were better able to comprehend at least some aspects of them. Thus, the geology, chemical engineering, and economics involved in finding gasoline, refining it, and getting it to market are at times part of news coverage of gas prices; the atmospheric science, civil engineering, and sociology involved in disasters and disaster response are at times part of news coverage of hurricanes; and the chemistry and biology of weaponry and the political science of building democracy are at times part of the coverage of the Iraq war. The survey data cannot discriminate finely enough to determine how much the public engages with the more scientific and technological aspects of stories like these.\nA different kind of news indicator is the amount of coverage news organizations devote to S&T. This indicator can involve either sheer quantity (e.g., newspaper space, broadcast time) or prominence (e.g., lead stories). For 20 years, the Tyndall Report has tracked the time that the three major broadcast networks devoted to 18 categories of news on their nightly newscasts (Tyndall Report 2007). Two categories with large S&T components are science, space, and technology, and biotechnology and basic medical research.5 Neither category has ever occupied a large percentage of the approximately 15,000 minutes of newscast coverage on the networks; science, space, and technology, the larger of the two categories, garnered 752 minutes in its peak year (1999). Both categories began the period at relatively low levels of coverage, climbed sharply beginning some time in the mid to late 1990s, dropped off even more sharply very early in the new century, and then showed signs of rebounding, but ending well below their peak levels (figure 7-4). Trends in the science, space, and technology category, along with recent annual lists of leading individual stories in that category, suggest that the advent of the Internet and the significance of developments in the nation's space program affected the amount of news coverage (table 7-4). The importance of competing stories, such as terrorist attacks, also plays a role. Data on front-page newspaper stories suggest that science figured somewhat more prominently in 2004 than in 1977, when it was hardly visible (Project for Excellence in Journalism 2005).\nInternational Comparisons Recent surveys conducted in other countries indicate that\nthe overall level of public interest in S&T is less than that in the United States. In 2005, 30% of survey respondents in Europe said they were very interested in new scientific discoveries, about half (48%) said they were moderately interested, and one-fifth said they were not at all interested. Comparable 2001 U.S. numbers were substantially higher for \"very interested\" and substantially lower for \"not at all interested.\" The distribution of European responses about interest in new inventions and technologies was almost identical to that for scientific discoveries. There was considerable variation in interest among European countries, and the overall level of interest was down somewhat from 1992, the last time these\n\nquestions were asked. Survey respondents who said they were not at all interested in either new scientific discoveries or new inventions and technologies most often gave \"I don't understand it\" or \"I do not care about it\" as reasons (European Commission 2005a). As in the United States, men in Europe showed more interest in S&T than women. Unlike in the United States, S&T interest in Europe appears to have declined between 1992 and 2005.\nResidents of several Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia, seem to express less interest than Americans and Europeans in S&T. However, China is a notable exception: interest levels for China were about the same as those for the United States (Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology 2002; European Commission 2005a, b; Korea Gallup 2007; Korea Science Foundation 2004; Malaysian Science and Technology Information Centre 2004; National Institute of Science and Technology Policy 2002).\nLike Americans, Europeans are more interested in medicine than in S&T in general. In the United States, in particular, nearly everyone is interested in new medical discoveries. In contrast, interest in new medical discoveries seems to be much lower in Asian countries than in the West.\nRelative to other topics, including S&T-related topics, interest in space exploration has consistently ranked low both in the United States and around the world. Surveys in Europe, Russia, China, and Japan document this general pattern.\nFigure 7-4 Network nightly news coverage of science and technology: 1988\u00ad2006\nAnnual minutes 800\n600\nScience, space, and technology 400\n200 Biotechnology and basic medical research\n0 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006\nNOTES: Data reflect annual minutes of story coverage on these topics by major networks ABC, CBS, and NBC out of approximately 15,000 total annual minutes on weekday nightly newscasts.

Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding\n\nInvolvement\nInvolvement with S&T outside the classroom in informal, voluntary, and self-directed settings such as museums, science centers, zoos, and aquariums is an indicator of interest in S&T.6 By offering visitors the flexibility to pursue individual curiosity, such institutions provide a kind of exposure to S&T that is well suited to helping people develop further interest. Professional scientists and engineers often stress the role of their informal S&T experiences in motivating them to pursue S&T careers (Bayer 2007).\nSurveys conducted for the Pew Internet and American Life Project and the Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS) indicate that about three of five American adults visited an informal science institution in the year preceding the survey (Griffiths and King 2007; Horrigan 2006). In the Pew survey, almost half said they had visited a zoo or aquarium; the IMLS data indicate that a little more than one-third had done so.7 The two surveys produced comparable estimates for \"natural history museum\" and \"science or technology museum,\" with percentages in the low to mid-twenties. The IMLS survey reported similar attendance figures for \"nature center\" (28%), \"arboretum or botanical garden\" (23%), and \"children's or youth\" museum (20%). Fewer Americans (14% in the Pew survey) said they had visited a planetarium. Data from these surveys are generally consistent with NSF data collected between 1979 and 2001.8\nWhen adults visit science-related informal learning institutions, they are more likely to be accompanied by family members and children than when they visit non-science-related\n\ninstitutions such as art or history museums. The IMLS survey asked parents who had visited a museum in the past year about whether their children had also made visits. For children between 3 and 17 years old, over two-thirds visited a zoo or aquarium in 2006. About half visited S&T museums, nature centers, and children's or youth museums. Comparable figures for history museums and historic sites were about 40%, and the percentage for art museums (22%) was even lower.9 Although similar percentages of adults (almost half) visited S&T museums and art museums, a much larger percentage of the children of those adults visited S&T museums (55%) than art museums (22%) (Griffiths and King 2007).\nAmericans who have more years of formal education are more likely than others to engage in these informal science activities (figure 7-5). Whereas 76% of college graduates engaged in at least one of the four informal S&T-related activities during the year preceding the Pew survey, the comparable figures for adults in other education categories were well below this (Horrigan 2006). Similar education differences also exist among visitors to public libraries and art museums. Education patterns in the IMLS data are similar (Griffiths and King 2007). Among Americans who visit these informal science institutions, younger adults and parents of minor children were also somewhat overrepresented.\nThe IMLS survey found that nearly one-third of Americans visited science-related informal learning institutions remotely via the Internet, mostly in conjunction with their in-person visits. Slightly less than half watched television programs that contained content from these institutions. The percentages for non-science-related institutions are similar.\n\nTable 7-4 Leading nightly news story lines on science and technology, by topic area: 2005 and 2006\n(Annual minutes of coverage)\n\nTopic area/leading story line\n\n2005\n\nScience, space, and technology NASA Space Shuttle program ......................................... 146 Databases invade privacy: files on individuals ................ 30 NASA Deep Impact astronomy probe studies comet...... 10 Internet online commerce volume increases ................... 10 Internet hardcore pornography proliferates..................... 9 Digital media: online downloadable music ...................... 8 Computer executive Carly Fiorina fired ........................... 8 NASA mulls renewed manned missions to moon............ 7 Digital media: online video on demand ........................... 7 Computer privacy invaded by spyware software ............ 6\n\nTopic area/leading story line\n\n2006\n\nScience, space, and technology NASA Space Shuttle program ......................................... 59 Internet used for social networking by teenagers ........... 27 Digital media: videostreams shared viral networks ......... 23 China censors Internet access, e-mail traffic .................. 13 Computer laptop batteries fire safety recall..................... 12 Internet search engine private data sought ..................... 11 Solar system astronomy: Pluto disqualified as planet..... 10 Cellular telephone use log privacy easily invaded ........... 8 Internet gambling Websites operate offshore.................. 8 NASA Hubble space telescope needs repair .................. 7\n\nBiotechnology/basic medical research Human embryo stem cell biotechnology research .......... 62 Animal cloning in agriculture research............................. 8 Animals-to-humans organ transplant research ............... 6\n\nBiotechnology/basic medical research War on cancer basic research efforts .............................. 50 Human embryo stem cell biotechnology research .......... 36 Animal cloning in agriculture research............................. 9\n\nNOTES: Data reflect annual minutes of story coverage on these topics by major networks ABC, CBS, and NBC, out of approximately 15,000 total annual minutes on weekday nightly newscasts.

In the EU-25, about 27% of adults said they had visited a zoo or aquarium, 16% said they had visited a \"science museum or technology museum or science centre,\" and 8% said they had attended a \"science exhibition or science `week'.\" As in the United States, older and less-educated Europeans reported less involvement in these activities. In addition, European adults in households with more inhabitants more often reported informal science activities; insofar as household size indicates the presence of minor children, this probably indicates another parallel with the United States. One demographic pattern is notably different between Europe and the United States: whereas European men (19%) are much more likely than women (13%) to visit informal science or technology museums and centers, in the United States visitors are drawn about equally from both sexes.\nEuropeans who said they had not visited S&T museums often mentioned lack of time (35%) or interest (22%) in doing so. Reasons relating to lack of awareness, for example,\nFigure 7-5 Attendance at informal science institutions, by institution type and education level: 2006\nPublic library\n\nZoo or aquarium\n\nArt museum\nNatural history museum\nScience or technology\nmuseum\n\nCollege graduate Some college High school graduate <High school\n\nPlanetarium\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nPercent\n\nSOURCE: Horrigan J, The Internet as a Resource for News and Information about Science, Pew/Internet (November 2006); and Pew Internet & American Life Project Survey (January 2006), http://www.pewinternet.org.\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n\"I didn't think about it\" (21%) and \"I do not know where these museums are\" (9%), also suggest an absence of strong interest in this kind of activity. However, lack of involvement can stem from factors unrelated to interest, too. Many respondents appeared to consider these institutions relatively inaccessible, either because they were \"too far away\" (23%) or too expensive (7%).10\nCompared with the United States, visits to informal science institutions are also less common in Japan, South Korea, China, and, especially, Russia (Gokhberg and Shuvalova 2004). It is unclear to what degree these international variations are a result of differences in interest, differences in accessibility, or other factors.\nPublic Knowledge About S&T\nAs the scientific and technical content of modern life grows, citizens increasingly need to be more scientifically literate to make sound public policy and personal choices. In developing an internationally agreed upon approach to conceptualizing and measuring scientific literacy, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (2003) noted that literacy had several components:\nCurrent thinking about the desired outcomes of science education for all citizens emphasizes the development of a general understanding of important concepts and explanatory frameworks of science, of the methods by which science derives evidence to support claims for its knowledge, and of the strengths and limitations of science in the real world. It values the ability to apply this understanding to real situations involving science in which claims need to be assessed and decisions made. . . .\nScientific literacy is the capacity to use scientific knowledge, to identify questions and to draw evidence-based conclusions in order to understand and help make decisions about the natural world and the changes made to it through human activity. (pp. 132\u00ad33)\nAs the reference to changes made through human activity makes clear, the OECD definition encompasses an understanding of technology. In addition, OECD takes the view that literacy is a matter of degree and that people cannot be classified as either literate or not.\nA good understanding of basic scientific terms, concepts, and facts; an ability to reason well about issues involving S&T; and a capacity to distinguish science from pseudoscience are indicators of scientific literacy. (For a different perspective on scientific literacy, see sidebar \"Asset-Based Models of Knowledge\").\nAmericans need to comprehend common scientific and technological terms such as DNA or molecule and recall commonly cited facts so they can make sense of what they read and hear about S&T-related matters. Whether they turn their attention to congressional debates over stem cell research or to instructional videos or pamphlets explaining how to use a newly purchased electronic device, the messages they\n\n\f7-16 \n\nChapter 7. Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding\n\nget presuppose some basic knowledge of terms, concepts, and facts. For S&T, as for other topics, even people with superior reasoning and cognitive skills are at a disadvantage when they lack basic information, especially if others take such information for granted and make statements that build on it (Hirsch 2006).\nAppreciating the scientific process can be even more important than knowing scientific facts. People often encounter claims that something is scientifically known. If they understand how science generates and assesses evidence bearing\nAsset-Based Models of Knowledge\nMany researchers and educators interested in the public's understanding of science advocate studying the assets people bring to bear on scientific issues that they deal with in their daily lives. Because individuals encounter S&T in different ways, they acquire different S&T knowledge \"assets,\" which they then can use to make sense of unfamiliar issues. For researchers and educators who favor an asset-based model of scientific literacy, public understanding of science is less a \"generalized body of knowledge and skills that every citizen should have by a certain age\" than \"a series of specific sets of only moderately overlapping knowledge and abilities that individuals construct over their lifetimes\" (Falk, Storksdieck, and Dierking forthcoming). In education, asset-based perspectives on knowledge have been useful in helping teachers build on children's existing strengths to improve their performance.\nGeneralized assessments of S&T knowledge, by asking questions on topics that may be of little interest to many respondents, may underestimate the assets available to individuals when they deal with S&T matters of greater interest and consequence to them. In contrast, a knowledge assessment that is tailored to an S&T domain with which an individual is familiar might yield very different results. In addition, because people often use their knowledge assets in group interactions, such as a nature outing, some researchers question the value of individual assessments in a test or survey (Roth and Lee 2002).\nNational indicators that evaluate domain-specific knowledge or group problem-solving are not practical. Surveys cannot use different measures to enable gardeners, auto mechanics, and amateur astronomers to demonstrate their different S&T-related assets and then reliably aggregate the results from different S&T domains. Nonetheless, a perspective on scientific literacy that stresses domain-specific or group assets is useful in that it points to a significant limitation of generalized indicators of individual scientific literacy.\n\non these claims, they possess analytical methods and critical thinking skills that are relevant to a wide variety of facts and concepts and can be used in a wide variety of contexts.\nAn additional indicator of how well people apply scientific principles in real world contexts is how they assess pseudoscientific claims, which adopt the trappings of science to present knowledge claims that are not grounded in the systematic methodology and testing associated with science.\nU.S. survey data indicate that many Americans cannot provide correct answers to basic questions about scientific facts and do not reason well about selected scientific issues. Residents of other countries, including highly developed ones, perform no better, on balance, when asked similar questions. In international comparisons of scientific knowledge and reasoning, then, American adults appear to rank somewhat better than American middle and high school students (see chapter 1, \"Elementary and Secondary Education\"). Any generalizations about Americans' knowledge of science must, however, be tentative, given the measurementrelated uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this chapter.\nUnderstanding Scientific Terms and Concepts\nU.S. Patterns and Trends U.S. data do not show much change over time in the pub-\nlic's level of factual knowledge about science.11 Figure 7-6 shows the average numbers of correct answers to a series of mostly true-false science questions in different years (appendix table 7-4).12 Although performance on individual\n\nFigure 7-6 Correct answers to scientific literacy questions: 1992\u00ad2006\nMean\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0 1992\n\n1995\n\n1997\n\n1999\n\n2001\n\n2006\n\nNOTES: Number correct of 12 questions.

Especially for questions outside the biological sciences, men tend to answer correctly more often than women (table 7-5).\nThe factual knowledge questions that have been repeatedly asked in U.S. surveys involve information that was being taught in grades K\u00ad12 when most respondents were young. Because science continually generates new knowledge that reshapes how people understand the world, scientific literacy requires lifelong learning so that citizens become familiar with terms, concepts, and facts that emerged after they completed their schooling. In 2006, the General Social Survey (GSS) asked Americans questions that tested their knowledge of two topics that historically have not been central to the standardized content of American science education: nanotechnology and the Earth's polar regions. For all but the youngest respondents, several of the questions concerned knowledge that was too new for them to have learned it in school. Nonetheless, survey respondents who scored relatively well on the questions that have been asked repeatedly over the years also exhibited greater knowledge of these two topics (figure 7-7).13 Likewise, the educational and demographic characteristics associated with higher scores on the knowledge questions that have been repeatedly asked are also associated with higher scores for these two new topics (appendix table 7-7). These data suggest that the knowledge items used to measure trends, although focused on the kind of factual knowledge learned in school, are a reasonable indicator of factual science knowledge more generally, including knowledge that is acquired later in life.\nIf Americans' performance in answering factual knowledge questions concerning science can be deemed disappointing, the same is true for their performance in other areas of knowledge (see sidebar, \"Science Knowledge and Civic Knowledge\"). Survey data of varying quality have been interpreted to indicate that Americans, especially the young, do not know enough about history, civics, geography, and politics, and are not sufficiently interested in these and other domains of knowledge that, like scientific knowledge, can serve as a foundation for understanding the world around them (Bauerlein 2006; Gravois 2006).\nInternational Comparisons Adults in different countries and regions have been asked\nidentical or substantially similar questions to test their factual knowledge of science.14 Knowledge scores for individual items vary from country to country, and no country consistently outperforms the others (figure 7-8). For the widely asked questions reported in figure 7-8, knowledge scores are relatively low in Russia, China, and Malaysia. Compared\n\nwith the United States and the highly developed countries in Europe, Japanese scores are also relatively low.15\nScience knowledge scores vary considerably across the EU-25 countries (figure 7-9), with northern European countries, led by Sweden, recording the highest total scores on a set of 13 questions. For a smaller set of four items that were administered in both 1992 and 2005 in 12 European countries, each country performed better in 2005 (appendix table 7-8); in contrast, the U.S. data on science knowledge do not show upward trends over the same period. In Europe, as in the United States, men, younger people, and more highly educated people tend to score higher on these questions.\n\nFigure 7-7 Correct answers to polar and nanotechnology questions, by factual knowledge of science: 2006\nMean\n3.5\n\n3.0\n\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0 Top quartile\n1.2\n\n2nd quartile 3rd quartile Bottom quartile Factual knowledge of science\nPolar\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0 Top quartile\n\n2nd quartile 3rd quartile Bottom quartile Factual knowledge of science\nNanotechnology\n\nNOTES: Number correct of five polar questions and two nanotechnology questions.

In an exhaustive review of 50 years of research on civic knowledge, Delli Carpini and Keeter (1996) find patterns that are very similar to those in the distribution of scientific knowledge. More recent data give no indication that these patterns have changed (Pew Research Center for the People and the Press 2004, 2007b).\nThe following survey results, culled from a long list of knowledge questions about civic institutions and processes, give a flavor of what Americans do and do not know (Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996:70\u00ad1):\n Can correctly define Presidential veto (89% in 1989).\n Know that the First Amendment protects free press/ speech (75% in 1985).\n Know that English is not the official national language (64% in 1986).\n Can state the substance of the Brown v. Board of Education decision (55% in 1986).\n Know that Congress declares war (45% in 1987).\n Know the length of a term of office in the U.S. House of Representatives (30% in 1978).\nThese data suggest that limited public mastery of fundamental factual information is not a problem that is unique to S&T.\nPatterns in civic knowledge closely parallel those for science knowledge. Thus, much as individuals who demonstrate knowledge of the scientific process (see \"Understanding the Scientific Process\") also tend to score well on factual knowledge questions, people who are more famil-\n\niar with the rules that govern civic institutions also tend to be more knowledgeable about political figures, parties, and the substance of public policy. The data on civic knowledge also parallel the data on science knowledge in other respects: political knowledge is strongly associated with formal education, women and minority group members tend to score somewhat less well on knowledge measures, more knowledgeable Americans tend to express more interest in political and civic matters and rely more on longer written sources of information, and political knowledge is associated with higher income.\nThere are some minor differences, too. Older Americans tend to be better informed about civic matters but not about science. Unlike science knowledge, Americans' civic knowledge shows no signs of increasing over time and appears to be slightly weaker than that in other developed countries.\nDivisions among scholars over the implications of data on Americans' civic and science knowledge follow similar lines (Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996; Lupia 2006; Nisbet 2003; Toumey 2006). Some stress that by trusting knowledgeable people, Americans can adequately perform necessary tasks without acquiring much civic or scientific knowledge. Others stress that considerable knowledge is required as context for deciding whom and what to trust. Similarly, for some scholars, singling out civic or scientific knowledge as distinctively valuable amounts to imposing elite preferences on people who would rather not spend time learning about either science or politics. To others, however, knowledge of these domains seems central to active problem-solving and participation in the shared cultural life of a modern society.\n\nEvolution and the \"Big Bang\" In international comparisons, U.S. scores on two science\nknowledge questions are significantly lower than those in almost all other countries where the questions have been asked. Americans were less likely to answer true to the following scientific knowledge questions: \"human beings, as we know them today, developed from earlier species of animals\" and \"the universe began with a huge explosion.\" In the United States, 43% of GSS respondents answered true to the first question in 2006, about the same percentage as in every year (except one) that the question has been asked. In other countries and in Europe, the comparable figures were substantially larger: 78% in Japan, 70% in China and Europe, and more than 60% in South Korea. Only in Russia did less than half of respondents (44%) answer true. Among the individual countries covered in the 2005 Eurobarometer survey, only Turkey's percentage answering true to this question was lower than the U.S. percentage (Miller, Scott, and Okamoto 2006). Similarly, Americans were less likely than oth-\n\ner survey respondents (except the Chinese) to answer true to the big bang question. In the most recent surveys, less than 40% of Americans answered this question correctly compared with over 60% of Japanese and South Korean survey respondents.\nAmericans' responses to questions about evolution and the big bang appear to reflect factors beyond unfamiliarity with basic elements of science. The 2004 Michigan Survey of Consumer Attitudes administered two different versions of these questions to different groups of respondents. Some were asked questions that tested knowledge about the natural world (\"human beings, as we know them today, developed from earlier species of animals\" and \"the universe began with a big explosion\"). Others were asked questions that tested knowledge about what a scientific theory asserts or a group of scientists believes (\"according to the theory of evolution, human beings, as we know them today, developed from earlier species of animals\" and \"according to astronomers, the universe began with a big explosion\"). Respondents were\n\n\f7-20 \n\nChapter 7.

An ongoing Gallup survey, conducted most recently in 2004, found that only about a third of Americans agreed that Darwin's theory of evolution has been well supported by evidence (Newport 2004). The same percentage agreed with the alternative statement that Darwin's theory was not supported by the evidence, and an additional 29% said they didn't know enough to say. Data from 2001 were similar. Those agreeing with the first statement were more likely to be men (42%), have more years of education (65% of those with postgraduate education and 52% of those with a bachelor's degree), and live in the West (47%) or East (42%).\nIn response to another group of questions on evolution asked by Gallup in 2004, about half (49%) of those surveyed agreed with either of two statements compatible with evolution: that human beings developed over millions of years either with or without God's guidance in the process. However, 46% agreed with a third statement, that \"God created human beings pretty much in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years or so.\" These views on the origin of human beings have remained virtually unchanged (in seven surveys) since the questions were first asked in 1982 (Newport 2006).\nFor almost a century, whether and how evolution should be taught in U.S. public school classrooms has been a frequent source of controversy (see sidebar, \"Evolution and the Schools\"). The role of alternative perspectives on human origins, including creationism and intelligent design, and their relevance to the teaching of science, has likewise been contentious. When Gallup asked survey respondents in 2005 whether they thought each of three \"explanations about the origin and development of life on earth (evolution, creationism, and intelligent design) should or should not be taught in public school science classes\" or whether they were \"unsure,\" for each explanation more Americans chose \"should\" than chose either of the other alternatives (table 7-6).\nIn other developed countries, controversies about evolution in the schools have also occurred, but more rarely.\n\nTable 7-6 American views on which explanations of human origins should be taught in public school science classes: 2005\n(Percent)\n\nExplanation of human Should be Should not\n\norigins\n\ntaught be taught Unsure\n\nEvolution .......................\n\n61\n\n20\n\n19\n\nCreationism ..................\n\n54\n\n22\n\n24\n\nIntelligent design ..........\n\n43\n\n21\n\n36\n\nNOTES: Responses to: Do you think each of the following explanations about the origin and development of life on earth should or should not be taught in public school science classes, or are you unsure?

Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding\n\nEvolution and the Schools\n\nThe American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) gave its annual Award for Scientific Freedom and Responsibility for 2006 to 10 people \"who have been on the front lines of the battle to prevent introduction of `intelligent design' into science classrooms as an alternative to evolution\" (AAAS 2007). According to Dr. John Marburger, the head of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, the theory of evolution is \"the cornerstone of modern biology\" (Bumiller 2005). In a March 4, 2005, letter to National Academy of Sciences (NAS) members, Dr. Bruce Alberts, then president of NAS, characterized the theory of evolution as \"one of the foundations of modern science,\" urged America's leading scientists to help in their states and localities \"to confront the increasing challenges to the teaching of evolution in the public schools,\" and cited the succession of NAS efforts devoted to ensuring that evolution is taught appropriately (Alberts 2005).\nYet, despite endorsements of evolution from these and other representatives of the scientific and political establishment, controversy over how evolution should be taught in public schools remains a perennial feature of American life and shows no sign of disappearing. Instead, the controversy is evolving.\nEight of the AAAS awardees were science teachers in the Dover, Pennsylvania, school district who fought their school board's decision to require that they read a disclaimer about the theory of evolution to their ninth grade biology students. After stating that evolution was a theory, not a fact, and had \"gaps,\" the disclaimer directed students' attention to intelligent design, \"an explanation of the origin of life that differs from Darwin's view.\"*\nThe Dover disclaimer was successfully challenged in court (Kitzmiller v. Dover 2005). The case turned on whether the disclaimer violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which deals with the relationship between government and religion. The court concluded that intelligent design was a religious view and not a scientific theory and that, because the school board's policy was animated by a religious purpose and had a religious effect, neither the policy nor the disclaimer that implemented it was constitutional.\nIn reaching this conclusion, the court reviewed the history of efforts to have biblical views of the origins of life taught in the public schools, the legal decisions that posed obstacles to these efforts, and the subsequent efforts to exclude the teaching of evolution from the schools or undermine the scientific status of the theory\n\nin the eyes of high school students. It traced a succession of legal conflicts in which the teaching of creationism and creation science had been found to violate the Establishment Clause and that had led to the development of intelligent design.\nThe Discovery Institute (2007), a Seattle policy and research organization, is the leading proponent of intelligent design. The Discovery Institute characterizes itself as a secular institution and maintains that intelligent design is not based on the Bible and is not the same as creationism. It does not advocate requiring that intelligent design be taught in schools. Rather, it \"recommends that states and school districts focus on teaching students more about evolutionary theory, including telling them about some of the theory's problems.\" At the same time, it believes \"there is nothing unconstitutional about discussing the scientific theory of design in the classroom.\" Framed in this way, intelligent design may appear to be more distant from religion and less vulnerable to legal challenge than doctrines such as creationism and creation science, which have failed to pass constitutional muster (for a discussion of framing, see sidebar, \"Media Effects\").\nEven where, as in Dover, legal controversies over the teaching of evolution are resolved with affirmations of scientific evidence and criteria, thorough and substantive presentation of the theory of evolution in the schools is by no means guaranteed. The possibility that parents and students may object to the teaching of evolution, let alone evidence of organized efforts to resist it, may discourage some teachers from covering the topic in depth (Dean 2005). In addition, not all high school biology teachers subscribe to the accepted view of evolution or are well versed in the topic (Monastersky 2006).\nNumerous efforts are under way in the scientific community to make materials available to middle and high school teachers that will help them do a better job presenting the scientific evidence about evolution (Holden 2006; Monastersky 2006). Niles Eldredge, a prominent researcher in evolutionary biology, has announced plans to initiate a new journal, Evolution: Education and Outreach, to serve as a resource for teachers at all levels who wish to improve their treatment of the topic. The journal is scheduled to begin publication in March 2008 (Monastersky 2007).\n*Intelligent design \"holds that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection.\" (www.discovery.org)\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 7-23\n\nHowever, signs of opposition to the theory of evolution are emerging in Europe (Nature 2006).\nUnderstanding the Scientific Process\nU.S. surveys have used questions on three general topics to assess trends in Americans' understanding of the process of scientific inquiry. One set of questions tests how well respondents apply principles of probabilistic reasoning to a series of questions about a couple whose children have a one-in-four chance of suffering from an inherited disease.16 A second set of questions deals with the logic of experimental design, asking respondents about the best way to design a test of a new drug for high blood pressure. An open-ended question probes what respondents think it means to \"study something scientifically.\" Because probability, experimental design, and scientific method are all central to so much research that claims to be scientific, these questions are highly relevant to how respondents evaluate scientific evidence.\nThere appears to be a modest tendency for Americans to score better on these inquiry questions in recent years, especially when the questions are analyzed together in an inquiry index (appendix table 7-9). However, despite the use of identical coding instructions in different survey years, it is possible that year-to-year variations in coding practices for open-ended items and other subtle methodological differences may have affected this result. Performance on these questions is strongly associated with the different measures of science knowledge and education (appendix table 7-10). Older Americans and those with lower incomes, two groups that tend to have less education in the sciences, also tend to score less well on the inquiry measures.\nPseudoscience\nThe large numbers of Americans who regard astrology as at least somewhat scientific is an indicator that many Americans do not reliably distinguish between scientific and nonscientific knowledge claims. Available national data cannot differentiate those who misapply what they think are scientific criteria from those who in some respects reject conventional scientific criteria, even though they are familiar with them.\nAbout one-third of Americans in 2006 said they believed that astrology was at least \"sort of scientific.\" This proportion was almost exactly the same as in 2004. However, the 2004 and 2006 surveys indicate an apparent decline in the perception of astrology as scientific: the percentage of Americans who viewed astrology as not at all scientific was higher in these 2 years than it ever was in the 10 other times that this question was asked between 1979 and 2001 (appendix table 7-11). Respondents who have more years of formal education are less likely to perceive astrology to be at all scientific.\n\nPublic Attitudes About S&T in General\nThe U.S. S&E community hopes to improve society by developing knowledge and using it to solve problems and shape the world in which Americans live. U.S. national policy is built on this hope, which underlies the government's broad support for scientific research and technological development. The public's orientation toward S&T in general and toward institutions that are committed to S&T affects America's willingness and capacity to rely on S&T as a major strategy for improving the country's quality of life.\nGeneralized public support for S&T can make a difference in many ways. Public openness to technological change gives U.S. businesses opportunities to build a domestic customer base, create a foundation for worldwide technical competitiveness, and foster the national advantages that flow from pioneering innovations. Broad public and political support for long-term commitments to S&T research, especially in the face of pressing immediate needs, enables ambitious proposals for sustained federal S&T investments to reach fruition. Public confidence that S&E community leaders are trustworthy, S&E research findings are reliable, and S&E experts bring valuable judgment and knowledge to bear on public issues permits scientific knowledge to have influence over practical affairs. And, in an environment where positive public perceptions of S&E occupations predominate, promising young people are encouraged to pursue S&E careers.\nTo be sure, not all technological innovations, federal S&T investments, scientific pronouncements, or decisions to pursue S&E careers warrant support. It would be easy to cite instances in which scientific and technological optimism has been carried too far, and hard to dispute the idea that assertions that S&T-led social and economic progress will or has occurred in particular instances should be evaluated critically. But widespread, indiscriminate public skepticism about S&T, going beyond the reasoned examination of particular cases, would represent a radical and consequential change in American public opinion and would affect national strategies that link progress in S&T to overall national progress.\nThis section presents indicators of public attitudes and orientations toward S&T in general, in America and in other countries. It covers views of the promise of S&T and reservations about S&T; overall support for government funding of research; confidence in the leadership of the scientific community; perceptions of the proper influence of scientists over contested public issues about which the research community claims expertise; perceptions about what it means to be scientific and which disciplines and practices are scientific; and views of S&E as occupations. These indicators reflect general attitudes expressed in response to survey questions and disconnected from real-life decisions. How people apply these general views in practical situations, when attitudes toward science are only one of many considerations, is, of course, uncertain.\n\n\f7-24 \n\nChapter 7. Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding\n\nAttitudes and Question Wording\n\nIn the first paragraph of a May 16, 2006, press release, the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research (CAMR) reported that \"nearly three-quarters of Americans support embryonic stem cell research.\" Two weeks later, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) issued a press release. The first paragraph of that press release indicated that \"48% of Americans oppose federal funding of stem cell research that requires destroying human embryos, while only 39% support such funding\" (CAMR 2006; Levin 2006; Nisbet 2004; USCCB 2006).\nHow could two surveys, conducted by telephone 2 weeks apart and using similar methodologies, arrive at such different results?\nThe answer lies in wording and context (Schuman and Presser 1996). To their credit, later in their press releases, both organizations provided the wording of the actual questions respondents were asked:\nCAMR question: I'm going to read you a brief description of embryonic stem cell research, and then get your reaction. Embryonic stem cells are special cells that can develop into every type of cell in the human body. The stem cells are extracted from embryonic cells produced in fertility clinics and then frozen days after fertilization. If a couple decides that the fertilized eggs are no longer needed, they can choose to donate the embryos for research or the clinic will throw the embryos away. Scientists have had success in initial research with embryonic stem cells and believe that they can be developed into cures for diseases such as cancer, Parkinson's, heart disease, juvenile diabetes, and spinal cord injuries. Having heard this description, do you strongly favor, somewhat\n\nfavor, somewhat oppose, or strongly oppose medical research that uses stem cells from human embryos?\nUSCCB question: Stem cells are the basic cells from which all of a person's tissues and organs develop. Congress is considering the question of federal funding for experiments using stem cells from human embryos. The live embryos would be destroyed in their first week of development to obtain these cells. Do you support or oppose using your federal tax dollars for such experiments?\nThese two questions provide very different contextual information about stem cell research. To the organizations that sponsored the two surveys, the questions doubtless present the most relevant information for informed decisions. Most members of the public do not follow issues such as stem cell research very closely (Pew Research Center for the People and the Press 2006b), and the way questions are framed can influence their views.\nEven neutral survey organizations ask questions in different ways and produce different results. Their questions, although generally more useful for scientific research on public attitudes, neither present a \"correct\" context, create a situation in which context plays no role in how people respond, nor establish a context that closely approximates the one in which most citizens make decisions. Because survey responses are affected by subtle differences in wording and context, thoughtful researchers pay attention to precisely how questions are asked, give more weight to patterns and trends in survey results than to the percentage of people who choose a particular response, and examine the degree to which responses are stable across different surveys on the same topic.\n\nMore than responses to questions about facts or behaviors, responses about attitudes are highly sensitive to the way questions are worded and the context in which they are placed (see sidebar, \"Attitudes and Question Wording\"). Although this sensitivity affects survey responses about the general attitudes covered in this section, it is probably even more important for the specific, controversial issues, such as stem cell research or global climate change, that are discussed in the next section.\nPromise and Reservations\nAmericans of all kinds--men and women, college graduates and high school dropouts, blacks and whites--consistently endorse the past achievements and future promise of S&T. In practically any major American social grouping, individuals who express serious doubt about the promise of science are a rare breed.\nIn six annual Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Life Science Surveys beginning in 2001, the percentage\n\nof respondents who agreed that \"developments in science helped make society better\" ranged between 85% and 90%. Responses for \"developments in new technology\" ranged between 83% and 88% in these same surveys. Similarly, between 2002 and 2006, the surveys asked respondents whether they believed \"scientific research is essential for improving the quality of human lives\" and found that agreement ranged between 87% and 92% (VCU Center for Public Policy 2006).\nNSF surveys dating back to 1979 have yielded similar results. In 2006, about half (48%) of GSS respondents said that the benefits of scientific research strongly outweighed the harmful results. Substantial percentages said that benefits either slightly outweighed harms (22%) or volunteered that the two were about equal (17%), and only a small percentage (6%) said that harms either slightly or strongly outweighed benefits. The remainder said they did not know. These numbers were generally in keeping with those from earlier surveys (figure 7-10; appendix table 7-12).17\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 7-25\n\nFigure 7-10 Public assessment of scientific research: 1979\u00ad2006\nBenefits of scientific research strongly outweigh harmful results Benefits of scientific research slightly outweigh harmful results Benefits of scientific research are about equal to harmful results Harmful results of scientific research slightly outweigh benefits Harmful results of scientific research strongly outweigh benefits Don't know\n\n1979 1981 1985 1988 1990 1992 1995 1997 1999 2001 2004 2006\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nCumulative percent\n\nNOTE: Table includes all years for which data collected.\n\nSOURCES: National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Statistics, Survey of Public Attitudes Toward and Understanding of Science and Technology (1979\u00ad2001); University of Michigan, Survey of Consumer Attitudes (2004); and University of Chicago, National Opinion Research Center, General Social Survey (2006).

Agreement with this statement has been increasing moderately for over a decade.\nAmericans who have more years of formal education and score higher on measures of science knowledge express more favorable attitudes about S&T. A review of numerous surveys from around the world found, other things equal, a weak but consistent relationship between greater knowledge of science and more favorable attitudes toward it (see sidebar, \"How Knowledge Relates to Attitudes\").\nAlthough data from other countries are not entirely comparable, they appear to indicate that Americans have somewhat more positive attitudes about the benefits of S&T than Europeans, Russians, and Japanese. Attitudes in China and South Korea, however, are comparable with and perhaps\n\nHow Knowledge Relates to Attitudes\nIn an analysis of data from almost 200 nationally representative surveys conducted in 40 countries between 1989 and 2003, Allum et al. (2008) examined how knowledge of science relates to attitudes toward S&T. Data are mostly from Europe and North America, but suitable surveys from countries in other regions were also included; these tended to be economically developed countries, such as Japan and New Zealand.\nThe analysis divided knowledge indicators into two groups depending on whether they involved general knowledge of scientific facts and processes or knowledge of a relatively specific scientific domain such as biology or genetics. It grouped attitude indicators by topic, distinguishing among science in general, nuclear power, genetic medicine, genetically modified food, and environmental science.\nTo isolate the relationship between knowledge and attitudes, the study used statistical techniques to control for factors that might be expected to influence both knowledge and attitudes, such as the age, sex, and education level of the respondent and the country in which the survey was conducted. Controlling for these influences, it reached several conclusions:\n There is \"a small positive correlation between [favorable] general attitudes toward science and general knowledge of scientific facts and processes.\" Though small, this relationship appears consistently across countries.\n The relationship is stronger in the United States than in any of the other countries studied.\n The strength and nature of the relationship between knowledge and attitudes did not vary systematically over time during the period studied.\n Favorable attitudes about topics in a particular domain are more closely related to knowledge in that domain than to general science knowledge. Attitudes about genetically modified food, for example, show a stronger relationship to knowledge about biology and genetics than to general science knowledge.\n Contrary to findings in some other, less comprehensive studies, the relationship between knowledge and attitudes did not vary depending on differences in the level of economic development of the countries studied.\nThe study does not establish a causal link between knowledge and attitudes. Indeed, the authors conclude that \"scholars have overlooked the need to provide a satisfactory account of how knowledge of science relates to preferences regarding its technological implementation in society,\" and recommend that researchers address \"the social and psychological mechanisms that generate the associations we observe.\"\n\n\f7-26 \n\nChapter 7. Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding\n\neven more favorable than those in the United States (appendix table 7-13). In 2005, for example, Europeans were asked a question about the benefits and harms of science that was very similar to the U.S. question about the benefits and harms of scientific research.18 The U.S. percentage for more benefits than harms was 18 points higher than the European number, and the European percentage for more harms than benefits was 8 points higher than the U.S. number. However, differentials are less evident for other questions. In all of the countries and regions where survey data exist, statements about the achievements and promise of science elicit substantially more agreement than disagreement.\nBoth in the United States and abroad, respondents also express reservations about S&T. For 6 years (2001\u00ad06), VCU Life Sciences Surveys have asked respondents whether they agree that \"scientific research these days doesn't pay enough attention to the moral values of society.\" In each year, a majority has agreed. During this period, though, the percentage that agreed has dropped substantially, going from 73% in 2001 to 56% in 2006. In the 2006 GSS, large minorities of survey respondents registered agreement with other statements expressing reservations about science, including \"science is too concerned with theory and speculation to be of much use in making concrete government policy decisions that will affect the way we live\" (34% agree, 58% disagree) and \"science makes our way of life change too fast\" (44% agree, 53% disagree) (appendix tables 7-14 and 7-15). The latter question has been asked in numerous other countries (appendix table 7-13). Although levels of agreement with this statement in the United States appear to be similar to those in Russia, surveys in other countries record much higher levels of agreement.\nFederal Funding of Scientific Research\nU.S. public opinion consistently and strongly supports federal spending on basic research. NSF surveys have repeatedly asked Americans whether \"even if it brings no immediate benefits, scientific research that advances the frontiers of knowledge is necessary and should be supported by the Federal Government.\" Since 1979, about 80% of Americans have registered agreement in response to this question. In the most recent survey, agreement was even higher than in the past, with 87% favoring federal support in 2006. Responses to a GSS question about federal spending on scientific research provide further evidence of increasing public support for federal spending on scientific research. For the decade beginning in 1992, the percentage of Americans who thought that the government was spending too little on scientific research hovered between 34% and 37%. This percentage then grew from the 34% registered in 2002 to 38% in 2004 and 41% in 2006. In the 2006 survey, only 11% said that the government was spending too much in this area, which is lower than the comparable figure in any of the other 10 NSF or GSS surveys in which this question has been asked since 1981 (figure 7-11; appendix tables 7-16, 7-17, 7-18, and 7-19).\n\nFigure 7-11 Attitudes toward government funding of scientific research: 1981\u00ad2006\nPercent\n100\n\n80 Agree\n60\n\n40\n\n20 Disagree\n0 1985 1988 1990 1992 1995 1997 1999 2001 2004 2006\nGovernment should fund basic research: 1985\u00ad2006\n50\n\n40\n\n30 Too little\n20\nToo much 10\n\n0 1981\n\n1985 1988 1990 1992\n\n1997 1999 2002 2004 2006\n\nAssessment of government spending support for scientific research: 1981\u00ad2006\n\nNOTES: Top panel: survey results in 1985, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2004, and 2006; other years interpolated.

Support for increased spending is greater in numerous program areas, including education (73%), health care (72%), assistance to the poor (68%), environmental protection (67%), and Social Security (61%). Scientific research ranks about on a par with mass transit (38%) and well ahead of\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 7-27\n\nspace exploration (14%) and assistance to foreign countries (10%) in the proportion of the U.S. population favoring increased spending.\nIn other countries where similar though not precisely comparable questions have been asked, respondents also express strong support for government spending on basic scientific research. In 2005, 76% of Europeans agreed that \"even if it brings no immediate benefits, scientific research which adds to knowledge should be supported by government,\" and only 7% disagreed. Because the European survey offered a middle option (\"neither agree nor disagree\"), both of these percentages are lower than figures for the United States, where no middle category was offered. Agreement in South Korea, China, Malaysia, and Japan reaches levels generally comparable to those in the United States and Europe. Support for increased government spending on scientific research appears to be relatively common in Europe as well. Over half of Europeans agreed in 2005 that their \"government should spend more money on scientific research and less on other things.\" Although this proportion is nominally higher than the percentage of Americans who support more government spending, numerous context and wording differences between the questions leave responses open to substantially differing interpretations.19 Public support for increased spending on scientific research was substantially greater in South Korea (67% in 2004) than in the United States (Korea Gallup 2007).\nConfidence in the Science Community's Leadership\nFor the science-related decisions that citizens face, a comprehensive understanding of the relevant scientific research would require mastery and evaluation of more evidence than even working scientists could handle. In addition to relying on direct evidence from scientific studies, citizens who want to draw on scientific evidence must consult the judgments of leaders and other experts who they believe can speak authoritatively about the scientific knowledge that is relevant to an issue.\nNumerous questions arise about how, when, and how well citizens rely on others to help shape their opinions on scientific issues. When it comes to scientific questions, do they trust the leaders of the scientific community to provide reliable information and advice? Whom else do they trust to speak with authority about such matters? How, and how well, do they distinguish widely respected experts and consensual views from marginal dissidents and idiosyncratic judgments? Do they recognize the relevance of scientific evidence as often as they should? Do they exaggerate its relevance in some cases? Insofar as they must trust others, do they do so blindly, or do they make critical, though inevitably partial, evaluations of whose scientific claims warrant their trust and what kinds of evidence make those claims trustworthy?\nPublic confidence in the leaders of the scientific community is one indicator of public willingness to rely on science. At a minimum, such confidence is ordinarily a prerequisite\n\nfor taking scientific knowledge seriously in personal and public matters.\nSince 1973, the GSS has tracked public confidence in the leadership of various institutions, including the scientific community. The GSS asks respondents whether they have \"a great deal of confidence, only some confidence, or hardly any confidence at all\" in institutional leaders. In 2006, the percentage of Americans expressing \"a great deal of confidence\" in leaders was higher for the scientific community than for any other institution except the military. Conversely, the percentage expressing \"hardly any confidence at all\" was lower for scientific leaders than for leaders of any other institution about which this question was asked (table 7-7).\nThroughout the entire period in which this question has been asked, the percentage of Americans expressing a great deal of confidence in the leaders of the scientific community has fluctuated within a relatively narrow range, hovering between 35% and 45% (appendix table 7-20). In contrast, for some other institutions, confidence has been more sensitive to current events: the percentage of Americans professing a great deal of confidence in military leaders changed more between 2004 and 2006 than the comparable percentage for science leaders changed between 1973 and 2006.\nScience has usually ranked second or third in the public confidence surveys, with medicine or the military ranking first. The consistently high confidence in the leadership of the scientific community is in contrast to a general decline in confidence in institutional leaders over the past three decades. The medical community, for example, has seen a long-term decline in confidence: whereas over half of Americans expressed a great deal of confidence in medical leaders in the mid-1970s, the number has been around 40% in recent years. Since 2002, science has scored as well as or better than medicine on this indicator, although the scores for the two fields remain close.\nInfluence on Public Issues\nGovernment support for scientific research is predicated in significant measure on the idea that science can play a useful role in many public decisions. For science to play this role, it is helpful for the general public to support judicious efforts to bring scientific knowledge to bear on public matters and share the view that science ought to be considered relevant and influential.20\nThe 2006 GSS contained new batteries of questions that ask about the appropriate influence of science on four contested public issues to which scientific research might be considered relevant--global climate change, research using human embryonic stem cells, federal income taxes, and genetically modified foods. For each issue, survey respondents were asked how much influence a group of scientists with relevant expertise (e.g., medical researchers, economists) should have in deciding about the issue, how well the scientists understood the issue, and to what extent the scientists would \"support what is best for the country as a whole versus what serves their own narrow interests.\"21 The same\n\n\f7-28 \n\nChapter 7. Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding\n\nquestions were asked about elected officials and either religious leaders (for stem cell research) or business leaders (for the other issues). Respondents were also asked a question about their perception of the level of consensus among the scientists regarding a largely factual aspect of the issue and a question that probed their attitude regarding the issue.22\n\nThe GSS data indicate that Americans believe that scientists should have a relatively large amount of influence on public decisions concerning these issues (table 7-8).23 For the four issues, the percentage who said that scientists should have either a great deal or a fair amount of influence ranged from 85% (global warming) to 72% (income taxes). For each issue, the\n\nTable 7-7 Public confidence in institutional leaders: 2006\n(Percent)\n\nType of institution\nMilitary ........................................................................................................

The contrast among the groups was more pronounced for the three issues that dealt with biological or geophysical phenomena than for income taxes, where elected officials ranked closely behind economists. Even for the tax issue, however, this appears to be as much or more because of greater willingness to accord elected officials substantial influence than because of greater skepticism about economists. Among the three issues in which respondents compared scientists, elected officials, and business leaders, the tax issue stands out as the one where the public believes elected officials and business leaders ought to have the most influence.\nAmericans also give scientists relatively high marks for understanding the four issues (table 7-9).24 The GSS asked respondents to rate each leadership group's understanding of a largely factual aspect of each issue on a five-point scale ranging from \"very well\" to \"not at all.\" For the three issues dealing with biological or geophysical phenomena, the difference in perceived understanding was big: between 64% and 74% of the public placed the relevant scientists in one of the top two categories, whereas only 9% to 14% placed any of the other groups in those categories. The contrast among groups was smaller for the tax issue, with economists (52%) ranking ahead of business leaders (44%) and elected officials (28%). As was the case for influence, this narrower gap among the groups is largely a matter of a relatively favorable perception of business leaders' and elected officials' understanding of the tax issue, although a less positive view of the economists' understanding also plays a role.\n\nPatterns for the question about which groups would \"support what is best for the country as a whole versus what serves their own narrow interests\" were similar (table 7-10).25 For each issue, Americans placed the scientific group in one of the top two categories much more often than they placed either of the other leadership groups in those categories. Differences were always at least 30 percentage points, even where comparisons concerned religious leaders, a group that might be expected to be perceived as less narrowly selfinterested than elected officials or business leaders.\nOne factor that may limit the influence of scientific knowledge and the scientific community over public issues is the perception that significant scientific disagreement exists, making scientific knowledge uncertain (Krosnick et al. 2006). GSS respondents were asked to rate the degree of scientific consensus on a largely factual aspect of each of the four issues, using a five-point scale ranging from \"near complete agreement\" to \"no agreement at all.\"26 The \"importance of stem cells for research\" was the only item for which as many as half of respondents (52%) chose one of the two points near the complete agreement end of the scale. Just 20% of respondents chose one of these points when asked about the extent to which \"economists agree on the effects of reducing federal income taxes.\" For all four issues, this set of questions generated many \"don't know\" responses and many responses at the midpoint of the scale, both of which are consistent with the idea that there is widespread public doubt about exactly how scientists view the issues (table 7-11).\n\nTable 7-9 Perceived understanding of public issues by various groups: 2006\n(Percent)\n\nDegree of understanding (on scale of 1 to 5)\n\nPublic issue/group\n\nVery well\n\nNot at all\n\nDon't\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\nknow\n\nGlobal warming\n\nEnvironmental scientists ....................................\n\n44\n\n22\n\n22\n\n4\n\n4\n\n4\n\nBusiness leaders................................................\n\n4\n\n8\n\n30\n\n32\n\n22\n\n4\n\nElected officials..................................................\n\n5\n\n7\n\n31\n\n29\n\n24\n\n4\n\nStem cell research\n\nMedical researchers...........................................\n\n50\n\n24\n\n15\n\n3\n\n3\n\n6\n\nReligious leaders................................................\n\n6\n\n8\n\n26\n\n29\n\n25\n\n6\n\nElected officials..................................................\n\n3\n\n7\n\n35\n\n26\n\n22\n\n6\n\nFederal income taxes\n\nEconomists ........................................................\n\n33\n\n19\n\n29\n\n7\n\n7\n\n5\n\nBusiness leaders................................................\n\n15\n\n29\n\n33\n\n12\n\n6\n\n4\n\nElected officials..................................................\n\n10\n\n18\n\n34\n\n19\n\n15\n\n5\n\nGenetically modified foods\n\nMedical researchers...........................................\n\n32\n\n32\n\n18\n\n8\n\n5\n\n6\n\nBusiness leaders................................................\n\n4\n\n7\n\n24\n\n31\n\n28\n\n6\n\nElected officials..................................................\n\n3\n\n6\n\n24\n\n33\n\n29\n\n5\n\nNOTES: Responses to: How well do the following groups understand: causes of global warming; importance of stem cell research; effects of reducing federal income taxes; risks posed by genetically modified foods?

These differences are especially pronounced for perceptions of\n\neconomists, despite the fact that the science knowledge and education measures do not test economic knowledge.\nThe interplay among the various indicators presented in this section cannot be understood without further research and analysis.

Likewise, it is not clear why public perceptions vary concerning different leadership groups or whether the interplay of attributes is the same in all segments of the public. In addition, the choice of factual examples raised in the questions may substantially affect responses. For example, it is possible that economists would be perceived very differently when the issue is foreign trade or environmental scientists when the issue is energy conservation. An alternative set of factual examples might also highlight the role of additional considerations that affect public views of who should influence public decisions.27\nWhat Makes an Activity Scientific\nThe label \"scientific\" is usually considered a favorable one, and many claim it for their research or occupation. When research studies claim to be scientific, they claim to produce valid knowledge; when occupations claim to be scientific, they claim their practitioners have systematic expertise. Because not all claims to science are equally warranted, it is important for the public to scrutinize these claims critically and use reasonable criteria to judge them.\nThe 2006 GSS asked two batteries of questions that probed what characteristics Americans associate with scientific studies and what disciplines and practices Americans consider scientific. These indicators provide insight into how Americans discriminate between more and less scientific endeavors.\nAttributes That Make Something Scientific One group of questions asks how important each of eight\ncharacteristics is in \"making something scientific.\" These characteristics can be divided into three groups--features of the research process, aspects of the credentials and institutional settings that lend credibility to the research, and external validation by other belief systems (i.e., religious and common sense beliefs). Americans were most likely to consider features of the research process to be very important (appendix table 7-25). Over two-thirds said that \"conclusions based on solid evidence\" (80%), \"carefully examin[ing] different interpretations of the results\" (73%), and replication of results by other scientists (67%) were very important in making something scientific.\nAmericans thought that researcher qualifications were almost as important, with 62% classifying \"the people who do it have advanced degrees in their field\" as very important. Institutional settings often associated with research, such as laboratories (41%) and universities (33%), ranked lower. For making research scientific, these settings were viewed as similar in importance to having results that were \"consistent with common sense,\" a belief system that is not a part of science. Most Americans viewed consistency with religion, another belief system outside of science, as either not too important (31%) or not at all important (39%) to making something scientific.\nResponse patterns for this group of questions are related to education (figure 7-12; appendix table 7-26). Although Americans at all levels of education rated research process characteristics as most important, more highly educated Americans\n\ngave these the highest ratings. In contrast, individual credentials, institutional auspices, and consistency with other beliefs were less important among more highly educated respondents than among others. As a result of these divergent patterns, the gap in importance between process characteristics and other attributes is very wide at higher levels of education but relatively narrow for people with less schooling.\nIt is reasonable to interpret the relationship between education and a more dominant emphasis on process criteria for judging whether something is scientific as indicating that more education fosters a more critical, evidence-oriented approach to studies and conclusions that claim to be scientific. This interpretation would likewise suggest that less-educated people more often give weight to more questionable criteria that are either correlated with or unrelated to being scientific. However, other interpretations cannot be entirely ruled out. For example, people who internalize process-oriented understandings of science early in their schooling may be more successful academically and more likely to pursue advanced education. Another possibility is that additional schooling\nFigure 7-12 Importance of process, credentials, and external validation to belief that something is scientific, by education level: 2006\nMean score 4\nProcess\nCredentials\n3 External validation\n2\n\n1\n\n0 <High school\n\nHigh school Some graduate or college equivalent\n\nAssociate's Bachelor's Graduate degree degree degree\n\nNOTES: Responses to how important each of eight statements is to making something scientific--very important, pretty important, not too important, not important at all (where 4 = very important and 1 = not important at all).

Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding\n\nmay lead individuals to adopt a conventional account of science in general without having a strong or consistent impact on how they actually evaluate knowledge claims.\nWhich Fields Are Scientific The 2006 GSS asked Americans about eight fields of re-\nsearch or practice and whether they were \"very scientific, pretty scientific, not too scientific, or not scientific at all.\" A similar question on the 2005 Eurobarometer about an overlapping set of fields allows some comparison between U.S. and European perspectives.\nPractically all Americans perceived medicine as very or pretty scientific (table 7-12). Americans identified medicine most strongly with science even though it is focused more on practical service delivery and less on research than other fields on the list, including biology and physics. Nonetheless, both of these disciplines were also overwhelmingly seen as either very or pretty scientific. Americans with more years of education and more classroom exposure to science and mathematics more often believed that these two fields were relatively scientific (appendix table 7-27). This was especially true for physics. Engineering, which, like medicine, involves the application of scientific knowledge to practical problems, nonetheless ranked well below the other three fields on this measure. About 50% of Americans said that the two social science disciplines on the list (economics and sociology) were very or pretty scientific. Accounting and history were least often placed at the scientific end of the scale. About 30% of Americans consider each of these fields \"not at all scientific,\" a percentage that far exceeds that for any of the other fields. Survey respondents with less education were more likely than others to classify history as relatively scientific.\nThe 2005 Eurobarometer asked about five fields that were included in the 2006 GSS (figure 7-13). For these fields, Europeans and Americans had similar views: medicine was seen as the most scientific, with physics and biology follow-\n\ning closely behind and, after a large gap, economics leading history. There were two minor differences. Europeans rated physics as somewhat more scientific than biology, whereas\n\nFigure 7-13 European perceptions of scientific nature of various fields: 2005\n\n1 Not at all\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5 Very\n\nDon't\n\nscientific\n\nscientific\n\nknow\n\nMedicine 12 6 19\n\n70\n\n2\n\nPhysics 2 3 9\n\n19\n\n64\n\n3\n\nBiology 2 4 15\n\n23\n\n52\n\n4\n\nEconomics 13 16\n\n28\n\n21\n\n18 4\n\nHistory 19\n\n18\n\n25\n\n18\n\n17 3\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nCumulative percent\n\nNOTES: Responses to: People have different opinions about what is scientific and what is not.

Europeans saw history as more scientific than Americans did, and the gap between history and economics was wider in the United States than in Europe.\nViews of S&E Occupations\nData on public esteem for S&E occupations may be an indicator of the attractiveness of these occupations and their ability to recruit talented people into their ranks. Such data may also have a bearing on the public's sense that S&E affect the nation's well being in the future.\nFor nearly 30 years, the Harris Poll (Harris Interactive 2006b) has asked about the prestige of a large number of occupations, including scientists and engineers (table 7-13). In 2006, over 50% of Americans said that scientists had \"very great prestige,\" and about one-third expressed this view about engineers. Most occupations in the surveys rank below engineers.\nThe percentage of survey respondents attributing \"very great prestige\" to scientists has fluctuated between 51% and 59% in 11 surveys conducted since 1982 and for which results are available in its most recent Harris Poll summary of trends. During the same period, the percentage for engineers has also fluctuated in a relatively narrow range, moving between 28% and 37%. In neither case has there been a clear trend. In contrast,\n\nlong-term trends are evident for other occupations, including teachers (up), military officers (up), and lawyers (down).\nScientists ranked higher in prestige than almost all occupations in the Harris surveys. In recent years, their ranking was comparable with that of nurses, doctors, and firefighters and slightly ahead of teachers and military officers. Although engineers are not in this top group, very few respondents say that engineers have \"hardly any prestige at all.\" In 2006, only 4% of the public gave this response, which was about the same as for scientists and four other occupations; only medical doctors ranked noticeably better on the \"hardly any prestige at all\" measure, and 14 occupations ranked significantly lower.\nPrestige appears to reflect perceived service orientation and public benefit more than high income or celebrity (Harris Interactive 2004). Americans are more likely to trust people in prestigious occupations (including scientists) to tell the truth (Harris Interactive 2006a).\nSome evidence suggests that Americans rate scientific careers more positively than is the case in at least some other countries. In 2004, a little over 50% of South Koreans said they would feel happy if their son or daughter wanted to become a scientist, but 80% of Americans surveyed in 2001 expressed this feeling. Among Chinese, however, science ranked second to medicine as an occupation that survey respondents would like for their children (NSB 2006).\n\nTable 7-13 Prestige of various occupations: Selected years, 1977\u00ad2006\n(Percent)\n\nOccupation\n\n1977 1982 1992 1997 1998 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006\n\nDoctor....................................... 61\n\n55\n\n50\n\n52\n\n61\n\n61\n\n61\n\n50\n\n52\n\n52\n\n54 58\n\nScientist.................................... 66\n\n59\n\n57\n\n51\n\n55\n\n56\n\n53\n\n51\n\n57\n\n52\n\n56 54\n\nTeacher ..................................... 29\n\n28\n\n41\n\n49\n\n53\n\n53\n\n54\n\n47\n\n49\n\n48\n\n47 52\n\nMilitary officer ...........................

Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding\n\nPublic Attitudes About Specific S&T-Related Issues\nPublic attitudes can affect the speed and direction of S&T development. When science plays a substantial role in a national policy controversy, more than the specific policies under debate may be at stake. The policy debate may also shape public opinion and government decisions about investments in general categories of research. Less directly, a highly visible debate involving science may shape overall public impressions of either the credibility of science or the proper role of science in other, less visible public decisions. Likewise, public attitudes about emerging areas of research and new technologies can have an impact on innovation. The climate of opinion concerning new research areas can influence levels of public and private investment in related technological innovations and, eventually, the adoption of new technologies and the growth of industries based on these technologies.\nFor these reasons, survey responses about policy controversies involving science, specific research areas, and emerging technologies are worthy of attention. In addition, responses about relatively specific matters provide a window into the practical decisions through which citizens translate more general attitudes into actions, although, like all survey responses, how these responses relate to actual behavior remains uncertain. More generally, even in democratic societies, public opinion about new scientific and technological developments does not translate directly into actions or policy. Instead, it filters through institutions that selectively measure what the public believes and either magnify or minimize the effects of divisions in public opinion on public discourse and government policy (see sidebar, \"Designs on Nature\").\nPolicy attitudes always involve a multitude of factors and not just knowledge or understanding of relevant science. Values, morals, judgments of prudence, and numerous other factors can come strongly into play, and judgments about scientific fact are often secondary. In assessing the same issue, different people may find different considerations relevant.\nThis section begins with data on environmental issues, especially global climate change. It then covers attitudes toward recent and novel technologies, including medical biotechnology, agricultural biotechnology (i.e., genetically modified food), and nanotechnology. Data on cloning and stem cell research follow, and the section concludes with some recent data on attitudes toward science and mathematics education.\nEnvironment and Climate Change\nThe Gallup Organization's annual survey on environmental issues indicates that Americans have recently become somewhat more concerned about environmental quality (figure 7-14). Between 2005 and 2007, the percentage of Americans expressing \"a great deal\" of worry about the \"quality of the environment\" rose from 35% to 43%, returning to approximately its 2001 level after 4 years (2002\u00ad05) at about 35% (Saad 2006a, 2007).\n\nFigure 7-14 Worry about quality of environment: 2001\u00ad07\nPercent\n100\n\n80 Great deal/fair amount\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0 2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\nNOTE: Poll conducted annually in March.\nSOURCES: Saad L, Americans See Environment as Getting Worse, The Gallup Poll (20 April 2006), http://www.galluppoll.com/content? ci=22471, accessed 4 March 2007; and special tabulation (2007).\nScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nDespite this rise in concern, however, worry about the environment ranked somewhere in the middle among the 12 issues about which Gallup asked in 2007. Between 70% and 80% of Americans expressed either a great deal or a fair amount of worry about environment and most other issues (Social Security, drug use, crime and violence, future terrorist attacks, the economy, hunger and homelessness, and availability and affordability of energy); only availability and affordability of healthcare (83%) ranked above this range, and only illegal immigration (68%), unemployment (59%), and race relations (51%) ranked below it. In 2006 Gallup surveys, most Americans (62%) believed that the government spent too little to protect the environment and only a handful thought it spent too much (4%) (Gallup Organization 2007a). These numbers are in keeping with 2006 GSS responses to a similar question. Support for additional government spending, after dropping between 1992 to 2003, has rebounded in recent years, rising 11 percentage points between 2003 and 2006. Nonetheless, the trend in support for environmental protection is less evident when Americans are asked about tradeoffs between environmental protection and economic growth (figure 7-15). Indeed, as gasoline prices increased, public support for oil exploration in the Alaskan Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and expanded use of nuclear energy rose substantially between 2003 and 2006. However, support dropped significantly in Gallup's 2007 survey (Gallup Organization 2007a).\nGlobal warming has recently become more prominent among environmental issues for the American public. In 2004, 2006, and 2007, Gallup asked Americans how much they worry about 10 environmental issues. The percentage of Americans who said they worried \"a great deal\" about\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 7-35\n\nDesigns on Nature\n\nIn Designs on Nature (2005), Sheila Jasanoff analyzed how the United States, Great Britain, and Germany have grappled with recent developments in biotechnology. Her study sought to explain numerous differences among these three leading S&T powers in the kind of political dynamics spawned by biotechnology:\n Agricultural biotechnology generated much more concern in British public life than in either Germany or the United States.\n Embryo research was relatively uncontested in Britain, publicly divisive in the United States, and debated in institutionalized governmental forums in Germany without becoming a salient political issue for a wider public.\n Patenting life forms was seen as an ethical issue in Europe but not in the United States.\n All three nations considered bioethics important, but each understood it very differently.\nFor Jasanoff, differences in public opinion do not, for the most part, account for these political differences. Rather, differences in political culture and institutions shape when, whether, and how public opinion is mobilized in the political arena and becomes a significant force affecting biotechnology issues. Often, elite deliberations are relatively insulated from public attitudes, and elite politics plays a large role in how the public defines and responds to new scientific issues.\nJasanoff points to differences in how knowledge becomes publicly validated in the three countries, differences that affect \"national discourses of risk and safety, naturalness and artificiality, innovation and ownership, constitutional rights, and bioethics\" (Jasanoff 2005, pp. 20\u00ad1). Differences in public discourse, combined with differences in regulatory approaches, legal institutions, and styles of managing conflict, affect how these countries respond to the new ethical and policy challenges posed by biotechnology. Although countries tend to respond in accordance with long-standing cultural and institutional patterns, Jasanoff observed that countries also alter and adapt these patterns to deal with the novel issues that biotechnology raises.\nFor each country she studied, Jasanoff identified a dominant cultural and institutional paradigm that characterizes its general approach to issues at the intersection of science and politics:\n\n United States. In a predominantly \"contentious,\" adversary process, groups with competing interests vie to define relevant knowledge. Courts loom unusually large as arbiters of disputes, and federal administrators are relatively passive. Public optimism about technology creates an environment that is open to experimentation unless there are demonstrated risks or pre-existing regulatory barriers. New technologies often validate themselves only after they are introduced, by not causing unacceptable harms. Skepticism about expertise makes it difficult to resist demands for quantified measures, formal credentials, and transparent decision processes. Science is viewed as a sphere of objective knowledge separate from \"the contaminating touch of politics\" (Jasanoff 2005, p. 288).\n Great Britain. Biotechnology policy is developed in an atmosphere in which the credibility of stateregulated science has been damaged by the nation's experience with mad cow disease. Public trust in experts imbued with an ethic of public service and a reputation for character and judgment, although damaged, remains a key resource for validating scientific knowledge. Scientific experts associated with the government are trusted to be able to consult with affected parties, gather relevant information, and reach objective decisions that \"discern the public's needs\" (Jasanoff 2005, p. 268). Transparency is more an option than a requirement.\n Germany. Decisionmaking is consensus oriented, with interested parties participating in institutionalized deliberative processes organized by the federal government. Public debate is largely restricted to matters of values, and technical and factual issues are reserved for expert committees whose work is largely removed from public view. Committee members derive their stature from public trust in the institutions they represent. The public assumes that the state can assemble competent expert bodies composed of reasonable individuals who, although they reflect diverse interests and perspectives, can negotiate a shared view of the public interest.\nJasanoff emphasized that these patterns, though resilient, are not rigid, and that actual political processes are more fluid than the central tendencies she described.\n\nglobal warming rose by 15 points during this period, more than for any of the other issues (Carroll 2006, 2007). Even with this increase, however, global warming still ranked eighth among these issues. At 36%, the percentage of Americans worrying a great deal about this issue was 10 or more points below the comparable figure for \"pollution of drink-\n\ning water\" (58%), \"pollution of rivers, lakes, and reservoirs\" (53%), \"contamination of soil and water by toxic waste\" (52%), and \"maintenance of the nation's fresh water supply for household needs\" (51%).\nRecent data show other signs that awareness concerning global warming is increasing. After 5 consecutive years\n\n\f7-36 \n\nChapter 7.

In addition, the number of Americans who say that the effects of global warming have already begun to occur was higher in 2006 and 2007 than it had been in a decade of surveys (Gallup Organization 2007a; Saad 2006b). The percentage of Americans who believe that most scientists think global warming is occurring has also been rising for over a decade (Nisbet and Myers 2007). However, although most Americans think that global warming is mostly the result of human activities rather than natural changes, public opinion on this question has been stable since 2001 (Gallup Organization 2007a).\nBiotechnology and Its Medical Applications\nRecent advances in recombinant DNA technology enable the manipulation of genetic material to produce plants and animals with more desirable characteristics. Americans, Canadians, and Europeans have similarly favorable attitudes toward biotechnology in general and medical applications in particular.\nIn 2005, over two-thirds of Americans said that they either strongly supported (19%) or supported (52%) \"the use of products and processes that involve biotechnology.\" Less than one-fourth expressed opposition. In Canada, support for biotechnology had been lower than in the United States in 2003, but climbed to 67% in 2005, closely resembling the U.S. figure (Canadian Biotechnology Secretariat 2005).28 Similarly,\n\nin 2005 almost two-thirds of Europeans, when asked about either biotechnology or genetic engineering,29 said that this technology would have a positive effect on their way of life in the next 20 years (European Commission 2005b).\nAmericans and Canadians also held similar views of biotechnology's potential in the field of medicine. In 2005, more than 8 of 10 respondents in each country agreed that biotechnology would be one of the most important sources of health treatments and cures in the 21st century (Canadian Biotechnology Secretariat 2005).\nFew Americans (about 1 in 10) consider themselves \"very familiar\" with biotechnology. Overall, Canadians report even less familiarity, although this difference is small. Without a strong knowledge base to use in evaluating information, their assessment of the credibility of information sources is an important element in forming their judgments about information on this topic. The Canada-U.S. Survey on Biotechnology asked respondents in both countries to rate their trust in various institutions that could provide information about biotechnology. It found similar results for both Canada and the United States. In both countries, scientific journals and government-funded scientists placed at or near the top of the list. Conversely, privately owned mass media, biotechnology company executives, and religious and political leaders ranked near the bottom in both countries (figure 7-16).\nGenetically Modified Food\nAlthough the introduction of genetically modified (GM) crops has provoked much less controversy in the United States than in Europe, U.S. popular support for this application of biotechnology is limited and does not explain the difference (see sidebar, \"Designs on Nature\"). In a series of five surveys conducted between 2001 and 2006, the Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology (Mellman Group, Inc. 2006) has consistently found that only about one-fourth of Americans favor \"the introduction of genetically modified foods into the U.S. food supply.\" Although opposition to GM food declined to 46% in the most recent survey, opposition remains much more common than support. The Canada-U.S. Survey on Biotechnology (Canadian Biotechnology Secretariat 2005) reported a similar finding. The proportion of U.S. survey respondents reporting a negative reaction to the phrase \"genetically modified food\" (44%) was more than twice the 20% that reported a positive reaction. Nonetheless, an analysis of public opinion on GM food concluded that Americans express more favorable views than Europeans, with Canadians falling somewhere in between (Gaskell et al. 2006).\nPew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology data (Mellman Group, Inc. 2006) suggest that misconceptions about GM food are widespread in the United States. Most Americans (60%) believe they have not eaten GM foods, even though processed foods in the United States commonly contain GM ingredients. This number has not shown a clear trend in the 5 years since Pew began asking this question. People who claim to have heard more about GM foods are more likely to say that they have eaten them. Although this survey found\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 7-37\n\nFigure 7-16 U.S. and Canadian views on credibility of sources of information on biotechnology: 2005\n\nScientific journals\nUniversity scientists funded by\ngovernment\nPublic TV networks\nWorld Health Organization\nGovernment scientists\nUniversity scientists funded by biotech companies Scientists who work for biotech companies\nEnvironmental groups\nGreenpeace\n\nU.S. Canadian\n\nReligious leaders\n\nPrivate TV networks\nSenior executives of biotech companies\nPrint media\n\nPolitical leaders\n\nPercent\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nPercent\n\nNOTES: Responses to: For each of the following, if you were to hear information from them regarding biotechnology, how much would you trust that information to be credible, using a scale of 1\u00ad5, where 1 is not at all credible and 5 is extremely credible?

Thus, when Americans are told that GM food is already widely used in commonly purchased groceries, the percentage judging them to be safe rises by about 10 points.30\nAs with biotechnology in general, Americans are apt to rely on trusted sources of information concerning GM food, about which their knowledge is also limited. Among sources listed in both the Pew survey on GM food and the Canadian Biotechnology Secretariat survey on biotechnology, American attitudes are generally consistent: scientists and government rank relatively high and biotechnology companies and the news media rank relatively low. In the Pew survey, more Americans (37%) expressed a great deal of trust in friends and family than in any\n\nother group. Although Americans' level of trust in farmers as sources of information on GM food was comparable with that for scientists and academics, others involved in commercial food production, including food manufacturers and biotechnology companies, were near the bottom of the list (figure 7-17).\nSurveys have generally found that Americans are even more wary of genetic modification of animals than they are of genetic modification of plants (Mellman Group, Inc. 2005). Stronger ethical and safety concerns appear to play a role in people's concern, and concern is greater among women than among men, although this gender gap has been declining. Many Americans express support for regulatory responses, including labeling foods with GM ingredients, but this support appears to be quite sensitive to the way issues are framed. Thus, whereas 29% of Americans expressed a great deal of confidence in \"the Food and Drug Administration or FDA,\" only about half as many expressed the same confidence when the question was posed about \"government regulators.\" In addition, the proportion that expressed great confidence in the FDA dropped by 12 percentage points between 2001 and 2006 (Mellman Group, Inc. 2006).\nAdditional findings from earlier U.S. surveys can be found in Science and Engineering Indicators 2006 (NSB 2006).\n\nFigure 7-17 Trust in information sources about genetically modified foods: 2006\n\nFriends and family\nFarmers\nScientists and academics\nFood and Drug Administration Environmental\ngroups\nConsumer groups\nReligious leaders\nGovernment regulators\nFood manufacturers\nBiotechnology companies\nThe news media\n\nTrust a great deal\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\nPercent\n\nNOTES: Responses to: Please tell me how much you trust what each group or organization says about genetically modified foods.

Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding\n\nNanotechnology\nNanotechnology involves manipulating matter at unprecedentedly small scales to create new or improved products that can be used in a wide variety of ways. Nanotechnology has been the focus of relatively large public and private investments for almost a decade, and innovations based on nanotechnology are increasingly common. Even relative to other new technologies, nanotechnology is still in an early stage of development.\nThe general public remains relatively unfamiliar with nanotechnology. Among 2006 GSS respondents, over half (54%) had heard \"nothing at all\" about it. An additional 25% had heard \"just a little,\" and smaller proportions had heard either \"some\" (15%) or \"a lot\" (5%) (appendix table 7-28). These numbers are similar to those that Cobb and Macoubrie (2004) reported in a survey done 2 years earlier. Familiarity with nanotechnology was at about the same level in Europe in 2005, where 44% of survey respondents said they had heard of it (Gaskell et al. 2005).\nEven among the minority of GSS respondents who had heard of nanotechnology, knowledge levels do not appear to be high (appendix table 7-7). Over half (57%) correctly responded true when asked whether \"nanotechnology involves manipulating extremely small units of matter, such as individual atoms, in order to produce better materials,\" but many (36%) said they did not know, and a few (7%) thought this statement was false. About half (51%) did not know whether or not \"the properties of nanoscale materials often differ fundamentally and unexpectedly from the properties of the same materials at larger scales.\" For this question, 39% correctly answered true and the remaining 9% answered false.\nWhen nanotechnology is defined in surveys, Americans express favorable expectations for it. After receiving a brief explanation of nanotechnology, GSS respondents were asked about the likely balance between the benefits and harms of nanotechnology. About 40% said the \"benefits will outweigh the harmful results,\" 19% expected the two to be about equal, and only 9% expected the harms to predominate (appendix table 7-29). The fact that about half of respondents either gave a neutral response (19%) or said they didn't know (32%) suggests that opinion may be open to change as Americans become more familiar with this technology. In a 2005 survey that asked Americans and Canadians about risks and benefits in two separate questions, about half of Americans foresaw substantial benefit or some benefit from nanotechnology, compared with 14% who saw substantial risk or some risk; Canadian responses were almost as optimistic (Canadian Biotechnology Secretariat 2005). Eurobarometer data, though not precisely comparable, indicate that European opinion is generally consistent with that of Americans (European Commission 2005b). In the 2005 Eurobarometer, 48% of Europeans expected nanotechnology to have \"a positive effect on our way of life in the next 20 years,\" whereas only 8% expected a negative effect. Although familiarity with nanotechnology is similar in Europe and the United States, more Europeans than Americans said they did not know whether or not this new technology would have a positive effect.\n\nAmong Americans, favorable expectations for nanotechnology are associated with more education, greater science knowledge, and greater familiarity with nanotechnology. Men are also somewhat more likely to have favorable expectations than women (appendix table 7-29). Patterns are similar to those for responses concerning S&T generally. Unlike in Canada, where younger people's views of nanotechnology are significantly more positive than the views of older people, Americans of all ages have similar opinions (Canadian Biotechnology Secretariat 2005).\nStem Cell Research and Human Cloning\nUnlike most issues involving scientific research, studies using embryonic stem cells have generated considerable public controversy. In the case of stem cell research, strongly held views about moral fundamentals determine many people's attitudes. There is little reason to believe that this is the case for certain other S&T issues, such as nanotechnology.\nAlthough a majority of the public supports such research, a significant minority is opposed. When surveys ask about medical technologies to be derived from stem cell research in the context of expected health benefits, public response is relatively positive. But technologies that involve cloning human embryos evoke consistently strong and negative responses.\nSince 2004, the majority of the American public has favored \"medical research that uses stem cells from human embryos\" (VCU Center for Public Policy 2006). Support grew continuously from 2002 (35% in favor) to 2005 (58% in favor), before returning to about the 2004 level in 2006 (figure 7-18). In five annual Gallup surveys between 2002 and 2006, the percentage of Americans who found such research \"morally acceptable\" in general climbed from 52% to 61%, while the percentage saying it was \"morally wrong\" in general correspondingly dropped from 39% to 30% (Gallup Organization 2007b). Likewise, a consistent majority in three Pew surveys conducted between December 2004 and July 2006 agreed that it was \"more important to continue stem cell research that might produce new medical cures than to avoid destroying the human embryos used in the research\"; about one-third of Americans said not destroying embryos was more important (Pew Research Center for the People and the Press 2006b).\nIn some circumstances, support for medical technologies derived from stem cell research can be even stronger than support for the research itself. When the question is framed as an emotionally compelling personal issue (\"If you or a member of your family had a condition such as Parkinson's Disease, or a spinal cord injury, would you support the use of embryonic stem cells in order to pursue a treatment for that condition?\"), 70% of Americans support treatments that use stem cells, and only 21% do not (VCU Center for Public Policy 2006). Responses become more mixed when questions mention \"cloning technology\" and decidedly negative when the technology is characterized as \"used to create human embryos\" (table 7-14).\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nFigure 7-18 Public attitudes toward stem cell research: 2001\u00ad06\n\nPercent\n\n100\n\n12\n\n17\n\n17\n\n24 27 23\n\n80 23\n\nStrongly favor\n\n31\n\n30\n\n60\n\n15\n\n29\n\n31\n\n31\n\nSomewhat favor\n\n9\n\n9\n\n40\n\n22\n\n11\n\n8\n\n11\n\n21\n\n21\n\n14\n\n17\n\n14\n\n20\n\n29\n\n22\n\n23\n\n22\n\n18\n\n20\n\nDon't know\nSomewhat oppose\nStrongly oppose\n\n0 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006\n\nNOTE: Responses to: On the whole, how much do you favor or oppose medical research that uses stem cells from human embryos?

In a Research!America survey, the idea of using \"cloning technology to produce a child\" is rejected by about 4 of 5 people, and VCU Center for Public Policy and other surveys produce very similar results (Center for Genetics and Society 2006; Research!America 2006). In six annual VCU surveys, at least 60% of Americans said they were \"strongly opposed\" to \"cloning or genetically altering\" humans (VCU Center for Public Policy 2006).\nThe specter of reproductive cloning can generate apprehension about therapeutic cloning. Asked how concerned they were that \"the use of human cloning technology to create stem cells for human therapeutic purposes will lead to a greater chance of human reproductive cloning,\" over two-thirds of Americans say they are either very (31%) or somewhat (38%) concerned (VCU Center for Public Policy 2006).\nPublic attitudes toward stem cell research and cloning are not grounded in a strong grasp of the difference between reproductive and therapeutic cloning, however. Most Americans say they are \"not very clear\" (35%) or \"not clear at all\" (35%) about this distinction, with 22% saying they are \"somewhat clear\" and only 7% characterizing themselves as \"very clear\" about it. Since VCU began asking this question in 2002, the number of Americans who profess greater comprehension has declined, despite, or perhaps because of, the increased visibility of stem cell research as a public issue.\nSupport for stem cell research is strongest among people with more years of formal education. Americans who are more religious, more conservative, and older are more likely to oppose such research (Gallup Organization 2007b; Pew Research Center for the People and the Press 2006b; VCU Center for Public Policy 2006).\n\nTable 7-14 Public opinion on medical technologies derived from stem cell research: Most recent year\n(Percent)\n\nQuestion\n\nFavor Oppose\n\n1.

Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding\n\nCanadian attitudes toward stem cell research are very similar (Canadian Biotechnology Secretariat 2005). Although European survey questions about stem cell research, medical applications, and cloning are sufficiently different from U.S. and Canadian data to make direct comparisons impossible, overall patterns and levels of support appear similar to those in North America (European Commission 2005b; Gaskell et al. 2006).\nS&T Education\nIn much public discourse about how Americans will fare in an increasingly S&T-driven world, education in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology is seen as crucial preparation for adult life. Perhaps because education is more a local issue than a national one, however, national public opinion data about education in science and related subjects are lacking. A recent national survey of parents with schoolage children indicates that most believe that \"greatly increasing the number and quality of math and science courses students take in high schools\" would do \"a lot\" or \"quite a bit\" to improve high school education in America (67%) and that it is \"crucial\" for most students to \"learn higher level math skills like advanced algebra and calculus\" (62%) (Public Agenda 2006). Nevertheless, when questions are personalized to their own children, a majority of these parents are satisfied with the amount of science their children are being taught in the schools. The percentage of Americans who believe that \"kids are not taught enough math and science\" is either a very or somewhat serious problem in their local public schools (32%) is 20 points lower than it was when this question was asked in 1994.\nConclusion\nIn assessing public knowledge and attitudes concerning S&T, two kinds of standards for judgment are possible. One standard is some conception of what a technologically advanced society requires, either currently or in the future, to be well prepared to compete in the world economy and enable its citizens to live satisfying lives. The other standard involves comparison with the past or with other countries.\nBy the first standard, individual judgments will inevitably vary, but it is safe to say that most proponents of S&T will find at least some of the data disquieting. They might view as causes for concern the significant minorities of Americans who cannot answer relatively simple knowledge questions about S&T, the proportion of Americans who express basic misconceptions about emerging technologies such as biotechnology and nanotechnology, or the proportion who believe relatively great scientific uncertainty surrounds global climate change. For many, some attitudes might appear problematic, too, such as the sizable parts of the population who express serious reservations about the place of morality in science or the speed of technological change, or who favor coverage of nonscientific material about human origins in public school science classes.\n\nTrend analyses that use past U.S. data as a basis for comparison paint a different picture. Relative to Americans in the recent past, today's Americans score as well on factual knowledge and somewhat better on understanding the process of scientific inquiry, are more skeptical about scientific claims for astrology, and are at least as optimistic about new technology and favorably disposed to increased government investment in science. When Americans compare science with other institutions, science's relative ranking appears to be as or more favorable than in the past. The survey data provide little or no evidence of declining knowledge or increasingly negative attitudes.\nWhen the data are examined using other countries as a benchmark, the United States compares favorably. Compared with adult residents of other developed countries, Americans appear to know as much or more about science, and they express as much or more optimism about technology. The only circumstance in which the United States scores below other countries on science knowledge comparisons is when, as with beliefs about human evolution, many Americans experience a conflict between accepted scientific knowledge and their religious beliefs.\nRegardless of the standard used in assessing public knowledge and attitudes, one strong and persistent pattern in the data stands out: more highly educated Americans tend to know more about S&T, express more favorable attitudes about S&T, and make discriminations that are more consistent with those likely to be made by scientists and engineers themselves. Thus, for example, they focus more heavily on process criteria for evaluating whether something is scientific, and their classification of fields as more and less scientific more closely resembles a classification that would be found in a university catalog. Along with their formal schooling, they appear to have acquired perspectives, attitudes, and knowledge akin to those found among the proponents of S&T. Whether or in what sense this association is causal is uncertain: although greater knowledge may affect attitudes and perspectives, pre-existing attitudes and perspectives may affect whether or not people acquire the kinds of knowledge available to them in school. What is clear, across a variety of indicators, is that Americans with relatively more years of education and more science knowledge also have perspectives and attitudes that more closely mirror those articulated by the leaders of the American S&E community.\nNotes\n1. The patterns in the use of data sources do not necessarily mean that people are getting information from lessdetailed sources. Newspapers and the Internet include long articles, and the Internet contains links to additional sources of information. In addition, declining reliance on magazines may result from short-term causes, such as a few S&T magazines going out of business without new ones immediately filling the market niche, rather than from a long-term change in information-seeking patterns.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 7-41\n\n2. Like most survey data, General Social Survey (GSS) data, used in figure 7-3 and elsewhere in this chapter, are weighted to make them correspond more closely to known parameters in the general population, such as sex and race distributions. In tables and figures that compare different survey years, the data are presented using a weighting formula that can be applied to all years. In tables that present only 2006 survey results, numbers are calculated using a new weighting formula that is designed to produce more accurate figures for that year. As a result, there may be minor discrepancies between the 2006 GSS results that appear in different tables and figures.\n3. A survey that called attention to particular sources of information on the Internet, such as Weblogs, might well produce different results.\n4. Although health news and science and technology news may appear to be closely related categories, the profile of people who follow each type of news closely is different: 63% of Americans who follow health closely are women, whereas 69% of Americans who follow S&T news closely are men (Pew Research Center for the People and the Press 2006a). Many researchers stress that both interest in and knowledge about S&T are often specific to individually defined domains within this broad category and do not generalize to the category as a whole (see sidebar, \"Asset-Based Models of Knowledge\").\n5. Science, space and technology includes manned and unmanned space flight, astronomy, scientific research, computers, the Internet, and telecommunications media. It excludes forensic science, S&E education, and telecommunications media content. Biotechnology and basic medical research includes stem cells, genetic research, cloning, and agribusiness bioengineering. It excludes clinical research and medical technology. Stories often do not fall neatly into a single category.\n6. People can become involved with S&T through many other non-classroom activities. Participating in government policy processes, going to movies that feature S&T, bird watching, and building computers are a few examples. Data on this sort of involvement with S&T are unavailable.\n7. It is possible that the substantial difference between Pew and IMLS estimates for \"zoos or aquariums\" is the result of differences in the categories the two surveys offered to respondents. Both surveys asked about zoos and aquariums, but IMLS also asked about nature centers and children's or youth museums, whereas Pew did not. Pew respondents who visited these kinds of museums may have reasoned that \"zoo or aquariums\" was the most closely comparable category in the survey and classified their visits accordingly.\n8. The NSF surveys asked respondents the number of times in the past year that they have visited an art museum, a natural history museum, a science or technology museum, a zoo or aquarium, or a public library. The Pew survey asks them whether or not they have visited one of the institutions, and includes planetarium in the list. For the S&T-related institutions in the list, the historic NSF numbers are about\n\n4 percentage points higher than the Pew numbers, but the difference may have to do with how the questions were asked. Some research suggests that when surveys ask for the number of times respondents have engaged in an activity, the percentage saying they have engaged in the activity at least once is larger than the percentage who would answer \"yes\" if asked whether they had engaged in the activity at all, probably because some respondents experience the first type of question as implying that the activity is common or acceptable (Knauper 1998; Sterngold, Warland, and Herrmann 1994). The IMLS survey's institution categories are sufficiently different from the NSF categories to make focused comparisons over time problematic.\n9. The IMLS survey only asked about children's museum visits in households where adults had visited a museum in 2006, either in-person or remotely via the Internet. Because IMLS assumed that children in other households did not visit museums, there is reason to believe that the actual percentages are somewhat higher than the IMLS estimates.\n10. One possible explanation for differences between Europe and the United States in attendance at informal science institutions is that adult leisure patterns reflect patterns that developed in childhood, when, especially for older Europeans, informal science institutions were less readily available than in the United States. The available national data do not permit a test of this explanation.\n11. Survey items that test factual knowledge sometimes use readily comprehensible language even at the cost of some scientific imprecision. This may prompt some highly knowledgeable respondents to feel that the items blur or neglect important distinctions, and in a few cases may lead respondents to answer questions incorrectly. In addition, the items do not reflect the ways that even established scientific knowledge evolves as scientists accumulate new evidence. Although the text of the factual knowledge questions may suggest a fixed body of knowledge, it is more accurate to see scientists as making continual, often subtle, modifications in how they understand existing data in light of new evidence.\n12. Early NSF surveys used additional factual knowledge indicators, which were combined to form an aggregate indicator. Bann and Schwerin (2004) performed statistical analyses on this and other groups of indicators to produce shorter scales that involved fewer questions and required less time to administer, but were functionally equivalent to the scales that used additional items (e.g., had similar measurement properties and yielded performance patterns that correlated with similar demographic characteristics). For factual knowledge, Bann and Schwerin produced two alternative scales that, except for one item, used identical questions. One of these scales was administered in 2004, and the other was substituted in 2006. Appendix table 7-4 presents trend data using each scale. To enable aggregated comparisons of 2004 and 2006 results, it includes the average numbers of correct answers to the group of overlapping items from those 2 years.\n\n\f7-42 \n\nChapter 7. Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding\n\n13. The two nanotechnology questions were asked only of respondents who said they had some familiarity with nanotechnology, and a sizable majority of the respondents who ventured a substantive answer (i.e., not \"don't know\") answered the questions correctly. To measure nanotechnology knowledge more reliably, researchers would prefer a scale with more than two questions.\n14. Even small, apparently nonsubstantive differences in question wording can affect survey responses. U.S. surveys, for example, have asked respondents whether or not it is true that \"it is the father's gene that decides whether the baby is a boy or a girl.\" In contrast, the 2005 Eurobarometer asked whether or not it is true that \"it is the mother's genes that decide whether the baby is a boy or a girl.\" To a scientifically knowledgeable respondent, these questions are equivalent. To other respondents, however, they may not be. Research has shown that some survey respondents have an \"acquiescence bias\"--when given the opportunity to do so, they tend to provide positive responses to questions and are therefore more likely to answer true than false (Schaeffer and Presser 2003). Thus, the U.S. question is probably easier to answer correctly than the Eurobarometer question; in other words, in two equally knowledgeable populations, more people would get the U.S. question right. Although Americans score better on this topic than Europeans, it is possible that this has as much or more to do with acquiescence bias as it does with scientific knowledge.\n15. In its own international comparison of scientific literacy, Japan ranked itself 10th among the 14 countries it evaluated (National Institute of Science and Technology Policy 2002).\n16. Early NSF surveys used additional questions to measure understanding of probability. Through a process similar to that described in endnote 12, Bann and Schwerin (2004) identified a smaller number of questions that could be administered to develop a comparable indicator. These questions were administered in 2004 and 2006, and appendix tables 7-9 and 7-10 record combined probability responses using these questions; appendix table 7-9 also shows responses to individual probability questions in each year.\n17. Methodological issues make fine-grained comparisons of data from different survey years suspect. Although the question content and interviewer instructions were identical in 2004 and 2006, for example, the percentage of respondents who volunteered \"about equal\" was substantially different. This difference may have been produced by the change from telephone interviews in 2004 to in-person interviews in 2006 (though telephone interviews in 2001 produced results that are similar to those in 2006). More likely, customary interviewing practices in the three different organizations that administered the surveys affected their interviewers' willingness to accept responses other than those that were specifically offered on the interview form, including \"don't know\" responses.\n18. The English version of the European question reads, \"The benefits of science are greater than any harmful effects\n\nit may have.\" Respondents can strongly agree, tend to agree, neither agree nor disagree, tend to disagree, strongly disagree, or say that they do not know. The U.S. question is prefaced by the statement that \"People have frequently noted that scientific research has produced benefits and harmful results\" and asks the respondent, \"Would you say that, on balance, the benefits of scientific research have outweighed the harmful results, or have the harmful results of scientific research been greater than the benefits.\" Respondents who say that the benefits are greater are then asked whether \"the balance has been strongly in favor of the benefits, or only slightly.\" Respondents who say the harmful results are greater are asked a parallel question to distinguish strongly from slightly. Some respondents are recorded as saying that the benefits and harmful results are \"about equal\" when they volunteer this response.\nAlthough these questions differ in their references to \"science\" and \"scientific research,\" \"effects\" and \"results,\" and in the exact wording of the response categories, they are similar in their overall thrust and in the availability of a middle category (\"neither agree nor disagree,\" \"about equal\"). For other questions that are worded similarly in the 2005 Eurobarometer and either the 2004 or 2006 NSF surveys, the presence of a middle category in Europe and the absence of one in the United States makes direct comparison problematic. This lengthy, though incomplete, comparison regarding a single question pair should provide some indication of why international attitude comparisons should be treated with caution.\n19. Unlike the U.S. question, the European question joins two logically independent ideas--more spending on science and less spending on other priorities. In addition, because nations begin from different levels of spending, survey responses cannot be read as indicating different views about the proper level of spending in this area, nor do they indicate the strength of sentiment in different countries. Differences in the connotations of questions posed in different languages add further complexities. Perhaps for some or all of these reasons, variations among European countries in responses to this question are large, with about two-thirds of respondents agreeing in Italy, Spain, and France, but less than onethird in Finland and the Netherlands.\n20. Some Americans may think that science can resolve differences over what to value or settle policy questions without requiring value judgments. This view accords science a kind of influence that goes beyond what the scientific community thinks it can properly exercise. There are no survey data that indicate how many Americans accord science too much influence in this regard.\n21. Although these questions treat economists as scientists and compare them to other categories of scientists, data reported later in this chapter indicate that many Americans do not consider economics to be very scientific. To understand public perceptions of the role of science and scientists in dealing with contested public issues, it helps to have indicators both for disciplines that the public almost universally\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 7-43\n\nsees as scientific and for disciplines whose scientific status is less secure in the public's eyes. Many social scientists (e.g., Gieryn 1999) believe that much can be learned from research on how institutional boundaries are defined and maintained. Universities overwhelmingly categorize economics as a social science.\n22. These question batteries were designed as indicators of public views regarding the appropriate influence of science on public issues generally. Questions were posed concerning specific issues both because (1) this is likely to increase the degree to which respondents think of similar situations when they make judgments and (2) because views about the appropriate role of science are likely to depend heavily on context. A study of any one of the specific issues would likely make somewhat different distinctions and ask more and different questions about the topic.\nThree other issues are worthy of mention: (1) Because survey respondents are variably familiar with the issues posed in these questions, certain categories are characterized with significant imprecision. For example, \"medical researchers\" is not an optimal characterization of the kind of researchers who are experts on the health effects of genetically modified foods. (2) Judgments that affect trust in leaders may be difficult to capture in survey questions. A concept such as disinterestedness, for example, (in the sense of a judgment made and expressed in light of appropriate collective interests and independent of personal interests that are not supposed to be given any weight) likely cannot be stated in language that can be used in a survey. (3) Comparable data on other issues is lacking, which makes generalizing observed patterns to other issues hazardous. Just as it is uncertain how attitudes that are highly general shape concrete judgments, it is uncertain how more specific judgments generalize beyond the terms in which they are posed. Because different attitude indicators have different limitations, it can be valuable to have indicators with complementary strengths and flaws. In all cases, it is worth keeping the actual question wording in mind when interpreting the significance of patterns in the data.\n23. The questions were worded as follows:\n \"How much influence should each of the following groups have in deciding what to do about global warming? a. Environmental scientists. Would you say a great deal of influence, a fair amount, a little influence, or none at all?\" This wording was then repeated in the next two questions, except that \"elected officials\" and \"business leaders\" were substituted for environmental scientists.\n \"How much influence should each of the following groups have in deciding about government funding for stem cell research? a. Medical researchers. Would you say a great deal of influence, a fair amount, a little influence, or none at all?\" This wording was then repeated in the next two questions, except that \"religious leaders\" and \"elected officials\" were substituted for medical researchers.\n \"How much influence should each of the following groups have in deciding whether to reduce federal income taxes?\n\na. Economists. Would you say a great deal of influence, a fair amount, a little influence, or none at all?\" This wording was then repeated in the next two questions, except that \"business leaders\" and \"elected officials\" were substituted for economists.\n \"Some say that the government should restrict the sale of genetically modified foods. Others say there is no need for such restrictions. How much influence should each of the following groups have in deciding whether to restrict the sale of genetically modified foods? a. Medical researchers. Would you say a great deal of influence, a fair amount, a little influence, or none at all?\" This wording was then repeated in the next two questions, except that \"elected officials\" and \"business leaders\" were substituted for medical researchers.\n24. The questions were worded as follows: \"On a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 means \"very well\" and 5 means \"not at all,\" how well do the following groups understand\" each of four public issues: \"the causes of global warming,\" \"stem cell research,\" \"the likely effects of reducing federal taxes,\" and \"the risks posed by genetically modified foods.\" For global warming, respondents were asked about environmental scientists, elected officials, and business leaders. For stem cell research, respondents were asked about medical researchers, religious leaders, and elected officials. For federal taxes, respondents were asked about economists, business leaders, and elected officials. For genetically modified foods, respondents were asked about medical researchers, elected officials, and business leaders.\n25. The questions were worded as follows: \"When making policy recommendations about\" each of four public issues \"on a scale of 1 to 5, to what extent do you think the following groups would support what is best for the country as a whole versus what serves their own narrow interests?\" The issues were \"global warming,\" \"stem cell research,\" \"federal income taxes,\" and \"genetically modified foods.\" If asked about what narrow interests meant, interviewers were instructed to respond \"Well, someone might gain financially if a certain policy were adopted or it might advance his or her career.\"\n26. Three of the four questions were worded as follows: \"On a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 means \"near complete agreement\" and 5 means \"no agreement at all,\" to what extent do\" groups of scientists \"agree on\" an issue. The groups and issues were \"environmental scientists/the existence and causes of global warming,\" \"medical researchers/the importance of stem cells for research,\" \"economists/the effects of reducing federal income taxes\" and \"medical researchers/the risks and benefits of genetically modified foods.\" The global warming question read \"agree among themselves about\" instead of \"agree on.\"\n27. Among the considerations that might be considered relevant are the role of ordinary citizens whose interests are specially affected by a decision and the institutional context for a decision (e.g., public versus private, different branches or levels of government). There is an extensive literature, analyz-\n\n\f7-44 \n\nChapter 7. Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding\n\ning mostly qualitative and nonnational data, that explores the complexities in when and why the public treats scientists and others as having the authority to influence or make decisions. Although attempts to synthesize that literature and clarify its relationship to what can be learned from national surveys would be welcome, this kind of multivariate analysis and interpretation goes well beyond the scope of this document.\n28. A 2006 Canadian survey showed little or no change from 2005 (Decima Research 2006).\n29. Although experts generally consider these two terms to be synonymous, survey results for \"biotechnology\" are generally more favorable than for \"genetic engineering\" (Gaskell et al. 2006).\n30. Food safety concerns are not the only reason that people oppose use of genetically modified foods. Other concerns include the environmental effects of genetically modified crops and the power that large corporations that manufacture genetically modified seed gain over the food supply.\nGlossary\nBiotechnology: The use of living things to make products. EU-25: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom. Genetically modified food: A food product containing some quantity of any genetically modified organism as an ingredient. Nanotechnology: Manipulating matter at unprecedentedly small scales to create new or improved products that can be used in a wide variety of ways. Therapeutic cloning: Refers to the use of cloning technology in medical research to develop new treatments for diseases; differentiated from human reproductive cloning.\nReferences\nAlberts B. 2005.

State Indicators\n\nIntroduction\nChapter Overview\nIn response to increasing interest in both the policy and research communities about the role of science and technology (S&T) in state and regional economic development, a new chapter devoted to the subject was introduced in the 2004 edition of Science and Engineering Indicators. The chapter focuses on the S&T indicators for individual states and the District of Columbia. It has been expanded in the 2008 edition from the original 24 state indicators to 47.\nThe reader is cautioned that all of the indicators are broad measures, and several rely on sample estimates that have a margin of error that may be substantial for some states; this is called out in appropriate places. In any case, small differences in state values generally carry no useful information.\nThe indicators are designed to present information about various aspects of state S&T infrastructure and to stimulate discussion about appropriate uses of state-level S&T indicators. The data used to calculate the indicators were gathered from both public and private sources. Whenever possible, data covering a 10-year span are provided to identify meaningful trends. However, because consistent data were not always available for the 10-year period, data for certain indicators are given only for the years in which comparisons are appropriate.\nReady access to accurate and timely information is an important tool for formulating effective S&T policies at the state level. By studying the programs and performance of their peers, state policymakers may be able to better assess and enhance their own programs and performance. The tables are intended to give the user a convenient listing of some of the quantitative data that may be relevant to technologybased economic development. In addition to describing the behavior of an indicator, the \"Findings\" section frequently presents an interpretation of the behavior's relevance and meaning. The interpretation is sometimes speculative, with the objective of motivating further thought and discussion.\nTypes of Indicators\nForty-seven indicators are included in this chapter and grouped into the following areas:\n Elementary and secondary education  Higher education  Workforce  Financial research and development inputs  Research and development outputs  S&T in the economy\nThe first two areas address state educational attainment. In this edition of Indicators, emphasis has been increased on the science and mathematics skills students develop at the elementary and middle school levels. Additional information on gender and racial/ethnic performance has been added in appendix tables 8-1 through 8-12 for those indicators reporting mathematics and science results for fourth and eighth graders. Student achievement is expressed in terms of performance, which refers to the average state score on a standardized test, and proficiency, which is expressed as the percentage of students who have achieved at least the expected level of competence on the standardized test.\n\nComparable state-level performance data are not available for high school students. Instead, mastery of collegelevel material through performance on Advanced Placement Exams has been included as a measure of the skills being developed by the top-performing high school students. Other indicators in education focus on state spending, teacher salaries, student costs, and undergraduate and graduate degrees in S&E. Three new indicators have been added to measure the level of education in the population of individual states.\nWorkforce indicators focus on the level of S&E training in the employed labor force. These indicators reflect the higher education level of the labor force and the degree of specialization in S&E disciplines and occupations.\nFinancial indicators address the sources and level of funding for R&D. They show how much R&D is being performed relative to the size of a state's business base. Comparison of these indicators illustrates the extent to which R&D is conducted by industrial or academic performers.\nThe Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR program) is a federal program aimed at building R&D capacity in states that have historically been less competitive in receiving federal R&D funding. Because this program does not cover all states and is basically focused on academic institutions, it is covered in chapter 5, Academic Research and Development, in the sidebar, \"EPSCoR--the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research.\"\nThe final two sections provide measures of outputs. The first focuses on the work products of the academic community and includes the production of new doctorate holders, the publication of academic articles, and patent activity both from the academic community and from all sources in the state.\nThe second section of output indicators examines the robustness of a region's S&T activity. These indicators include venture capital activity, Small Business Innovation Research awards, and high-technology business activity. Although data that adequately address both the quantity and quality of R&D results are difficult to find, these indicators offer a reasonable information base.\nData Sources and Considerations\nRaw data for each indicator are presented in the tables. The first entry in each table represents the average value for the states. For most indicators, the state average was calculated by summing the values for the 50 states and the District of Columbia for both the numerator and the denominator and then dividing the two. Any alternate approach is indicated in the notes at the bottom of the table.\nThe values for most indicators are expressed as ratios or percentages to remove the effect of state size and facilitate comparison between large and small states or heavily and sparsely populated states. For example, an indicator of higher education achievement is not defined as the absolute number of degrees conferred in a state because sparsely populated states are neither likely to have nor need as extensive a higher education system as states with larger populations. Instead, the indicator is defined as the number of degrees per number of residents in the college-age cohort, which measures the intensity of educational services relative to the size of the resident population.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-7\n\nNo official list of high-technology industries or sanctioned methodology to identify the most technology-intensive industries exists in the United States. The definition used here was developed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and is based on the percentage of employment in technology-oriented occupations. See \"Technical Note: Defining High-Technology Industries.\"\nAlthough data for Puerto Rico are reported whenever available, they frequently were collected by a different source, making it unclear whether the methodology used for data collection and analysis is comparable with that used for the states. For this reason, Puerto Rico was neither ranked with the states nor assigned a quartile value that could be displayed on the maps. Including data for U.S. territories and protectorates, such as American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and Virgin Islands, was considered; however, data for these areas were available only on a sporadic basis and for fewer than one-quarter of the indicators, so they were not included.\nKey Elements for Indicators\nSix key elements are provided for each indicator. The first element is a map that is color-coded to show in which quartile each state placed on that indicator for the latest year that data were available. This helps the reader quickly grasp geographic patterns. The sample map below shows the outline of each state. On the indicator maps, the darkest color indicates states\nU.S. Map and List of Abbreviations\n\nranking in the first or highest quartile, and white indicates states ranking in the fourth or lowest quartile. Cross-hatching indicates states for which no data are available.\nThe second element is a quartiles table. States are listed alphabetically by quartile. The range of indicator values for that quartile is shown at the top of the column. Ties at quartile breaks were resolved by moving the tied states into one quartile. Differences in states at the margins of adjacent quartiles will often not be substantively meaningful.\nThe third element, at the bottom of the map box, is a short citation for the data source. The full citation appears under the table on the facing page.\nThe fourth element, in a shaded box on the lower left side of the page, is a summary of findings that includes the national average and comments on trends and patterns for the particular indicator. Although most of the findings are directly related to the data, some represent interpretations that are meant to stimulate further investigation and discussion.\nThe fifth element, on the lower right side of the page, is a description of the indicator, a brief note about the nature of the data, and other information pertaining to the data.\nThe final element is the data table that appears on the facing page. Up to 3 years of data and the calculated values of the indicator are presented for each state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is included in the data table only when data are available.\n\nWA\nOR ID\n\nMT WY\n\nNV\n\nUT\n\nCA\n\nCO\n\nAZ\n\nNM\n\nAK\n\nND SD\nNE KS OK\nTX\n\nMN WI\nIA IL\nMO\nAR MS\nLA\n\nVT NH ME\n\nNY MI\n\nPA OH IN\nWV VA\nKY\n\nNC TN\nSC\n\nAL\n\nGA\n\nMA CT RI NJ\nDE\nMD\nDC\n\nFL\n\nHI\n\nAK........

See table 8-1.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 In 2005, the nationwide average mathematics score of fourth grade public school students was 237, a significant increase from 224 in 2000.\n\u00b7 For the 41 jurisdictions that participated in both the 2000 and 2005 mathematics assessments, the average score for public school fourth graders showed a statistically significant increase between 2000 and 2005. Only the District of Columbia reported a 2005 average score below the 2000 national average of 224.\n\u00b7 The entire fourth grade student sample, including students performing at the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles, demonstrated statistically significant gains in mathematics scores between 2000 and 2005.\n\u00b7 The gaps in mathematics scores between white fourth graders and black or Hispanic fourth graders narrowed between 2000 and 2005. The fourth grade gender gap in mathematics scores, although much smaller, decreased slightly between 2000 and 2005.\n\nThis indicator reports each state's average score on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) in mathematics for its fourth grade students in public schools. High scores indicate that fourth graders are demonstrating a solid foundation for adult mathematics competency. The NAEP mathematics assessment is a federally authorized assessment of student performance in which all 50 states and the District of Columbia participated in 2005. Student performance is described in terms of average scores on a scale from 0 to 500.\nSeveral recent changes to the NAEP methodology affect yearly\n\ncomparisons. Beginning in 2002, NAEP obtained a national sample by aggregating the samples from each state rather than by selecting it independently; the increased national sample size makes smaller differences statistically significant. In 2005, NAEP included in the definition of the national sample all international Department of Defense schools.\nNAEP allows students with disabilities or limited English proficiency to use certain accommodations (e.g., extended time, individual testing, or small group testing). All data presented here represent scores from tests taken with accommodations offered.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nTable 8-1 Fourth grade mathematics performance, by state: 2000, 2003, and 2005\n(Score)\n\nState\nUnited States...................................................................

In 2005, only 3 states and the District of Columbia had mathematics proficiency percentages below the 2000 national average of 22% compared with 20 jurisdictions below 22% in 2000.\n\u00b7 Substantial differences in mathematics proficiency exist between racial/ethnic groups of fourth graders. The gaps increased between 2000 and 2005 as blacks and Hispanics failed to match the gains made in mathematics proficiency by whites. The gender gap in proficiency among fourth graders is much smaller and remained unchanged between 2000 and 2005.\n\nThis indicator is the proportion of a state's fourth grade students in public schools that have achieved proficiency in mathematics. High indicator values show that a high percentage of a state's fourth graders has demonstrated a solid foundation for adult mathematics competency. Proficiency is based on achievement levels in the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) that reflect performance standards set by the National Assessment Governing Board to provide a context for interpreting student performance on NAEP. Approximately 172,000\n\nfourth grade students in 8,700 schools participated in the 2005 NAEP mathematics assessment.\nFor the fourth grade, the basic level (scores of 214\u00ad248) denotes partial mastery of knowledge and skills that are prerequisite for proficient work. The proficient level (249\u00ad281) represents solid academic performance and demonstrates competency over challenging subject matter knowledge, its application to real-world situations, and mastery of appropriate analytical skills. The advanced level (282\u00ad500) signifies superior performance.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nTable 8-2 Fourth grade mathematics proficiency, by state: 2000, 2003, and 2005\n(Percent)\n\nState\nUnited States............................................

Likewise, although 11 states reported lower scores in 2005, none of these declines was statistically significant, resulting in no states with lower average scores in 2005 than in 2000.\n\u00b7 Students performing at the 10th, 25th, and 50th percentiles demonstrated gains in science scores between 2000 and 2005, whereas students performing at the 75th and 90th percentiles showed no statistically significant change in average score.\n\u00b7 The gaps in science scores between white fourth graders and black or Hispanic fourth graders narrowed significantly between 2000 and 2005. The fourth grade gender gap in science scores, although much smaller, remained unchanged between 2000 and 2005.\n\nThis indicator reports each state's average score on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) in science for its fourth grade students in public schools. High scores indicate that fourth graders are demonstrating a solid foundation for adult science competency. The NAEP science assessment is a federally authorized assessment of student performance in which 44 states participated in 2005. Student performance is described in terms of average scores on a scale from 0 to 300.\nSeveral recent changes to the NAEP methodology affect yearly comparisons. Beginning\n\nin 2002, NAEP obtained the national sample by aggregating the samples from each state rather than by selecting it independently; the increased national sample size makes smaller differences statistically significant. In 2005, NAEP included in the definition of the national sample all international Department of Defense schools.\nNAEP allows students with disabilities or limited English proficiency to use certain accommodations (e.g., extended time, individual testing, or small group testing). All data presented here represent scores from tests taken with accommodations offered.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nTable 8-3 Fourth grade science performance, by state: 2000 and 2005\n(Score)\n\nState\nUnited States.....................................................................

See table 8-6.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 In 2005 nationwide, 29% of eighth grade public school students performed at or above the proficient level in mathematics, which represents a significant increase from 25% in 2000.\n\u00b7 Of the 39 states that participated in both the 2000 and 2005 assessments, 35 showed increases in mathematics proficiency among public school eighth graders in 2005. In 2005, 14 states and the District of Columbia had mathematics proficiency percentages below the 2000 national average of 25% compared with 21 jurisdictions in 2000.\n\u00b7 In 2005, all states showed higher proficiency in mathematics among fourth grade public school students than among eighth grade public school students.\n\u00b7 Substantial differences in mathematics proficiency exist between racial/ethnic groups of eighth graders, but these remained unchanged between 2000 and 2005. The gender gap in proficiency among eighth graders is much smaller and also remained unchanged between 2000 and 2005.\n\nThis indicator is the proportion of a state's eighth grade students in public schools that have achieved proficiency in mathematics. High indicator values show that a high percentage of a state's eighth graders has demonstrated a solid foundation for adult mathematics competency. Proficiency is based on achievement levels in the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) that reflect performance standards set by the National Assessment Governing Board to provide a context for interpreting student performance on NAEP. Approximately 161,600\n\neighth graders in 6,500 schools participated in the 2005 NAEP mathematics assessment.\nFor the eighth grade, the basic level (scores of 262\u00ad298) denotes partial mastery of knowledge and skills that are prerequisite for proficient work. The proficient level (299\u00ad332) represents solid academic performance and demonstrates competency over challenging subject matter knowledge, its application to real-world situations, and mastery of appropriate analytical skills. The advanced level (333\u00ad500) signifies superior performance.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nTable 8-6 Eighth grade mathematics proficiency, by state: 2000, 2003, and 2005\n(Percent)\n\nState\nUnited States...............................................................

Lower average scores were reported by 16 states in 2005, 4 of which were statistically significant.\n\u00b7 The gaps in science scores between white eighth graders and black or Hispanic eighth graders did not increase between 2000 and 2005.\n\nThis indicator reports each state's average score on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) in science for its eighth grade students in public schools. High scores indicate that eighth graders are demonstrating a solid foundation for adult science competency. The NAEP science assessment is a federally authorized assessment of student performance in which 44 states participated in 2005. Student performance is described in terms of average scores on a scale from 0 to 300.\nSeveral recent changes to the NAEP methodology affect yearly comparisons. Beginning in 2002, NAEP obtained a na-\n\ntional sample by aggregating the samples from each state rather than by selecting it independently; the increased national sample size makes smaller differences statistically significant. In 2005, NAEP included in the definition of the national sample all international Department of Defense schools.\nNAEP allows students with disabilities or limited English proficiency to use certain accommodations (e.g., extended time, individual testing, or small group testing). All data presented here represent scores from tests taken with accommodations offered.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nTable 8-7 Eighth grade science performance, by state: 2000 and 2005\n(Score)\n\nState\nUnited States...................................................................

The average salary represents the average base salary of all full-time public school teachers. Figures are given in current dollars. The year is the latter date of the academic year. The average includes both recent college graduates and seasoned veterans. Their educational credentials may encompass provisional certification through bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degrees.\n\nPublic school teacher salaries may reflect a range of factors, including the value placed on primary and secondary education, a state's cost of living, the experience and educational attainment of the teachers, and the local supply and demand in the job market.

See table 8-10.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 The 2005 national average for spending on elementary and secondary education was 3.43% of the GDP, a slight increase from 3.37% in 1995.\n\u00b7 Among individual states, the value for this indicator ranged from 2.29% to 5.11% of the state's GDP in 2005, indicating that some states were directing a much higher percentage of their resources toward elementary and secondary education. The District of Columbia was an outlier at 1.24%.\n\u00b7 States spending the highest percentage of their GDP on elementary and secondary education tended to have relatively small student populations (100,000\u00ad 300,000 students), indicating that some level of state spending may be required regardless of the size of the student population or the GDP.\n\u00b7 Spending for elementary and secondary current expenditures as a share of the state's GDP decreased in 24 states and the District of Columbia during the 1995\u00ad2005 period as spending for primary and secondary education failed to keep pace with growth in the local economy.\n\nThis indicator measures the relative amount of resources that local, state, and federal governments direct toward public education in prekindergarten through grade 12. It is calculated by dividing the current expenditures of elementary and secondary public schools by the gross domestic product (GDP). Current expenditures include instruction and instruction-related costs, student support services, administration, and operations and exclude funds for school construction and other capital outlays, debt services, and programs outside of public elementary and secondary education. State and local support represent the largest sources of revenue for elementary and secondary education.\n\nFinancial data on public elementary and secondary education are reported by the National Center for Educational Statistics, Department of Education. These data are part of the National Public Education Financial Survey and are included in the Common Core of Data, a comprehensive annual national statistical database covering approximately 94,000 public elementary and secondary schools and 14,000 school districts. Current expenditures are expressed in actual dollars. The year is the latter date of the academic year. For example, data for 2005 represent costs for the 2004\u00ad05 academic year. The District of Columbia and Hawaii each have only one school district; therefore, data for these two jurisdictions are not comparable to other states.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n

See table 8-11.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 Per-pupil spending on day-to-day operations grew nationwide from $5,529 in 1995 to $8,701 in 2005, an increase of 57% in unadjusted dollars.\n\u00b7 In 2005, all states showed substantial increases in per-pupil spending relative to 1995, and only 1 state failed to exceed the 1995 national average of $5,529 compared with 28 states in 1995.\n\u00b7 Per-pupil spending in individual states varied widely, ranging from a high of $14,117 to a low of $5,216 in 2005.\n\u00b7 There is no direct correlation between spending and academic performance. In fact, several states that ranked in the lower two quartiles of this indicator ranked in the upper quartiles of the National Assessment of Educational Progress indicators.\n\nThis indicator measures the investment by local, state, and federal governments in elementary and secondary education, adjusted for the size of the student body. It is calculated by dividing the current expenditures over the entire academic year for prekindergarten through grade 12 by the number of students in those grades in public schools. Current expenditures represent amounts expended for the day-to-day operations of schools and school districts. They include expenditures for instruction and instruction-related costs, student support services, administration, and operations and exclude funds for school construction and other capital outlays,\n\ndebt services, and programs outside of public elementary and secondary education. During the 2004\u00ad05 school year, 65.9% of current expenses were used for instructional costs, 5.2% for student support services, 11.0% for administrative costs, and 17.8% for operational costs.\nThe number of pupils enrolled in prekindergarten through grade 12 is determined during the fall of the academic year. All figures represent actual spending and have not been adjusted for inflation. The year is the latter date of the academic year. For example, data for 2005 represent costs for the 2004\u00ad05 academic year.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-29\n\nTable 8-11 Current expenditures per pupil for elementary and secondary public schools, by state: 1995, 2000, and 2005\n\nState\nUnited States.................

Thirty-five states and the District of Columbia exceeded the 2000 national average in 2006, compared with 15 states and the District of Columbia that exceeded the national average in 2000.\n\u00b7 AP participation levels were higher for all jurisdictions in 2006 than in 2000. Arkansas and the District of Columbia showed the largest increases; class of 2006 members in these jurisdictions exceeded the participation of the class of 2000 by 22.5 and 16.4 percentage points, respectively.\n\nParticipation in the Advanced Placement (AP) program provides a measure of the extent to which a rigorous curriculum is available to and utilized by high school students. This indicator measures the percentage of students in the graduating class who have taken one or more AP Exams. It is calculated by dividing the number of students in the graduating class who have taken at least one AP Exam by the total number of students in the graduating class.\nThroughout the United States, more than 660,000 public school students from the class of 2006 took nearly 1.7 million AP Exams during their high school careers. Generally, students who take AP Exams have\n\ncompleted a rigorous course of study in a specific subject area in high school with the expectation of obtaining college credit or advanced placement. AP Exams were taken most frequently in U.S. history, English literature and composition, English language and composition, calculus AB, and U.S. government and politics. In the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 12,037 public schools participated in the AP program in 2006. This represented over 65% of the public schools in the United States that offer a secondary curriculum. These schools make available an average of eight different AP courses to their students.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nTable 8-12 Share of public high school students taking Advanced Placement Exams, by state: 2000, 2004, and 2006\n(Percent)\n\nState\nUnited States.............................................

In 2006, 21 states and the District of Columbia had percentages below the national average of 10.2% compared with 38 jurisdictions in 2000.\n\u00b7 The percentage of students who are successful on AP Exams varies widely among states; state indicator values for public school students in the class of 2006 ranged from a low of 2.3% to a high of 22.7%. This wide range indicates that opportunities for advanced work are more readily available to students in certain states, and that these students are demonstrating college-level skills through successful completion of their AP programs.\n\u00b7 Values of this indicator were higher for all states in 2006 than in 2000. Maryland, Delaware, North Carolina, Washington, and Florida showed the largest increases; class of 2006 members in these states exceeded the performance of class of 2000 participants by more than 6 percentage points.\n\nThis indicator provides a measure of the extent to which high school students are successfully demonstrating their mastery of collegelevel material. It is defined as the percentage of U.S. public high school graduates who have scored 3 or higher on at least one Advanced Placement (AP) Exam. A high value on this indicator shows the extent to which students have been offered access to a rigorous curriculum and successfully mastered these requirements.\nA total of 37 different AP Exams are offered each spring by the College Board. The exams are scored on a scale of 1 to 5, with 3 representing\n\na range of work equivalent to midlevel B to midlevel C performance in college. To prepare for the AP Exam in a subject area, most students enroll in an AP class that employs a curriculum of high academic intensity. Scoring a 3 or higher indicates that the student has mastered the content of at least one such course of rigorous academic intensity at a level that would be acceptable in college. Performance on AP Exams is considered by many colleges and universities to be one of the best predictors of success in college. Many colleges and universities grant college credit or advanced placement for AP Exam grades of 3 or higher.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\nTable 8-13 Share of public high school students scoring 3 or higher on at least one Advanced Placement Exam, by state: 2000, 2004, and 2006\n(Percent)\n\nState\nUnited States...................................................

See Table 8-14.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 Nationwide, 84.8% of the early- to midcareer population had at least a high school credential in 2005, which is nearly identical with 85.0% in 2000.\n\u00b7 Only 21 states and the District of Columbia showed an increase in the percentage of their early- to mid-career population with at least a high school credential between 2000 and 2005. Thirteen states had 2005 values below the 2000 national average of 85.0% compared with 17 states and the District of Columbia in 2000.\n\u00b7 In 2005, the early- to mid-career population with at least a high school credential varied greatly among states, ranging from 77.0% to 99.4%. States in close proximity to the southern border tended to rank lowest on this indicator.\n\nThis indicator represents the percentage of the early- to mid-career population that has earned at least a high school credential. The indicator represents where high school graduates have chosen to live and work rather than where they were educated. The 25\u00ad44year-old cohort was selected because it is likely to capture both high school diplomas and equivalency degrees. High values indicate a resident population and potential workforce with widespread basic education credentials.\nEstimates of educational attainment are developed by the Census Bureau based on the 2000 Decennial Census and the American Community Survey\n\n(ACS). The census is conducted every 10 years, but the ACS provides annually updated data on the characteristics of population and housing. In 2005, ACS became the largest household survey in the United States, with an annual sample size of about 3 million addresses. Estimates of population are developed by the Census Bureau through the Population Estimates Program, which is also based on the 2000 Decennial Census. The value of this indicator may be imprecise for jurisdictions with small populations because both its numerator and denominator are based on estimates.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-35\n\nTable 8-14 High school graduates or higher among individuals 25\u00ad44 years old, by state: 2000, 2003, and 2005\n\nState\nUnited States...................

See Table 8-15.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 In 2005, 1.42 million bachelor's degrees were conferred nationally in all fields, up from 1.17 million in 1996.\n\u00b7 Over the past decade, the ratio of bachelor's degrees conferred to the 18\u00ad24-year-old population has remained essentially constant.\n\u00b7 In 2005, there was great variability among states in undergraduate educational opportunities relative to the size of their youthful population. Across the states, a range of 20.3 to 84.4 bachelor's degrees were conferred per 1,000 18\u00ad 24-year-olds; the District of Columbia was nearly 131 (an outlier reflecting a large concentration of academic institutions relative to the size of the resident population).\n\u00b7 In 18 states, the number of bachelor's degrees conferred per 1,000 18\u00ad24-year-olds decreased between 1996 and 2005.\n\nEarning a bachelor's degree gives people greater opportunities to work in higher-paying jobs than are generally available to those with less education; it also prepares them for advanced education. In addition, the capacity to produce degrees may generate resources for the state. The ratio of bachelor's degrees awarded to a state's 18\u00ad24-year-old population is a broad measure of a state's relative success in producing degrees at this level. The 18\u00ad24-year-old cohort was chosen to approximate the age range of most students who are pursuing an undergraduate degree.\nAlthough the number of bachelor's degrees awarded is based on an actual count, the population of 18\u00ad24-year-olds is an estimate de-\n\nveloped by the Census Bureau in the Population Estimates Program, which relies on the Decennial Census. This estimate may make the value of this indicator imprecise for jurisdictions with small populations.\nA high value for this indicator may suggest the successful provision of educational opportunity at this level. Student and graduate mobility after graduation, however, may make this indicator less meaningful in predicting the qualifications of a state's future workforce. The indicator's value may also be high when a higher education system draws a large percentage of out-of-state students, a situation that sometimes occurs in states with small resident populations and the District of Columbia.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-37\n\nTable 8-15 Bachelor's degrees conferred per 1,000 individuals 18\u00ad24 years old, by state: 1996, 2001, and 2005\n\nState\nUnited States...................

See table 8-16.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 During the past decade, the value of this indicator has remained unchanged at 7.9 NS&E bachelor's degrees conferred per 1,000 18\u00ad24-year-olds.\n\u00b7 The percentage of NS&E bachelor's degrees among all bachelor's degrees conferred declined slightly from 16.8% in 1996 to 16.4% in 2005.\n\u00b7 The value of this indicator ranged from 3.1 to 14.9 for individual states. However, the District of Columbia had a value of 18.6, reflecting a large concentration of academic institutions relative to the size of the resident population.\n\u00b7 The value for this indicator has decreased in 21 states and the District of Columbia over the past decade.\n\u00b7 State rankings were generally in the same quartile for this indicator as for the number of bachelor's degrees conferred per 1,000 18\u00ad24-year-olds.\n\nNatural sciences and engineering (NS&E) fields include physical, earth, ocean, atmospheric, biological, agricultural, and computer sciences; mathematics; and engineering but exclude social sciences and psychology. The ratio of new NS&E bachelor's degrees to the 18\u00ad24-year-old population indicates the extent to which a state prepares young people to enter the types of technology-intensive occupations that are fundamental to a knowledge-based, technology-driven economy. The capacity to produce NS&E degrees also may generate resources for the state. The 18\u00ad24-yearold cohort was chosen to approximate the age range of most students who are pursing an undergraduate degree.\nAlthough the number of NS&E bachelor's degrees awarded is based on an actual count, the population of\n\n18\u00ad24-year-olds is an estimate developed by the Census Bureau in the Population Estimates Program, which relies on the Decennial Census. This estimate may make the value of this indicator imprecise for jurisdictions with small populations.\nA high value for this indicator may suggest relative success in providing a technical undergraduate education. Student and graduate mobility after graduation, however, may make this indicator less meaningful in predicting the qualifications of a state's future workforce. The indicator's value may also be high when a higher education system draws a large percentage of out-of-state students to study in NS&E fields, a situation that sometimes occurs in states with small resident populations and the District of Columbia.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-39\n\nTable 8-16 Bachelor's degrees in natural sciences and engineering conferred per 1,000 individuals 18\u00ad24 years old, by state: 1996, 2001, and 2005\n\nState\nUnited States...................

See Table 8-17.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 In 2005, more than 609,000 S&E bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees were conferred nationwide, an increase of 21% during the past decade.\n\u00b7 Overall, there has been a slight decline in the number of S&E degrees as a share of total degrees conferred from 31.0% in 1996 to 29.9% in 2005.\n\u00b7 States place different emphases on technical higher education. In some states, nearly 40% of their degrees are awarded in S&E fields; in others approximately 20% of their degrees are awarded in these fields.\n\u00b7 State emphasis on S&E education remained relatively constant over the decade; notable exceptions are increases in Hawaii and Maryland and decreases in Wyoming and Arizona.\n\u00b7 The District of Columbia has a high value of 41% because of the large S&E graduate programs in political science and public administration at several of its academic institutions.\n\nThis indicator is a measure of the extent to which a state's higher education programs are concentrated in S&E fields. The indicator is expressed as the percentage of higher education degrees that were conferred in S&E fields. High values for this indicator are from states that emphasize S&E fields in their higher education systems.\nS&E fields include physical, life, earth, ocean, atmospheric, computer, and social sciences; mathematics; engineering; and psy-\n\nchology. For both S&E degrees and higher education degrees conferred, bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees are included; associate's degrees are excluded. Geographic location refers to the location of the degree-granting institution and does not reflect the state where students permanently reside. The year is the latter date of the academic year. For example, data for 2005 represent degrees conferred during the 2004\u00ad05 academic year.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-41\n\nTable 8-17 S&E degrees as share of higher education degrees conferred, by state: 1996, 2001, and 2005\n\nState\nUnited States...................

See table 8-18.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 The number of S&E graduate students in the United States grew 15% over the previous decade, rising from approximately 409,000 in 1996 to more than 471,000 in 2005.\n\u00b7 Individual states showed varying levels of graduate level S&E training, with 0.5%\u00ad2.7% of their 25\u00ad34year-old population pursuing S&E graduate studies in 2005.\n\u00b7 The District of Columbia is an outlier, with about 8% of its 25\u00ad34-year-old population enrolled as S&E graduate students, reflecting a large concentration of S&E graduate programs in political science and public administration and a small resident population.\n\u00b7 Changes in the value of this indicator over the past decade may reflect shifts in population, changes in S&E graduate education, or a combination of both. Growth in the number of S&E graduate students was highest in California, Texas, and Florida between 1996 and 2005.\n\nGraduate students in S&E fields may become the technical leaders of the future. The ratio of S&E graduate students to a state's 25\u00ad34-year-old population is a relative measure of a state's population with graduate training in S&E. The 25\u00ad34-year-old cohort was chosen to approximate the age of most graduate students. The cohort includes U.S. citizens and noncitizens as well as graduate students who come from other states. The population cohort includes all state residents ages 25\u00ad34 and does not distinguish between citizens and noncitizens.\n\nData on S&E graduate students were collected by surveying all academic institutions in the United States that offer doctoral or master's degree programs in any science or engineering field, including physical, life, earth, ocean, atmospheric, computer, and social sciences; mathematics; engineering; and psychology. Graduate students who are enrolled in schools of nursing, public health, dentistry, veterinary medicine, and other health-related disciplines are not included.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-43\n\nTable 8-18 S&E graduate students per 1,000 individuals 25\u00ad34 years old, by state: 1996, 2001, and 2005\n\nState\nUnited States...................

See table 8-19.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 In 2005, more than 147,000 advanced S&E degrees were awarded nationwide; this total represented approximately 22% more than in 1996, but the share of advanced degrees remained stable at 24% of all S&E degrees conferred.\n\u00b7 Some states specialize in providing graduate-level technical training, with nearly 35% of their S&E graduates completing training at the master's or doctoral level; other states have much smaller graduate S&E programs, with values as low as 8%.\n\u00b7 Over the past decade, the largest absolute increases in the production of advanced S&E degree holders have occurred in California, New York, and Texas.\n\u00b7 In states with small S&E graduate programs, the number of advanced S&E degrees conferred varies considerably from year to year. Caution should be used in making annual comparisons for those states with small S&E graduate programs.\n\u00b7 The District of Columbia is an outlier, with 44% reflecting large S&E graduate programs in political science and public administration at several of its academic institutions.\n\nThis indicator shows the extent to which a state's higher education programs in S&E are concentrated at the graduate level. S&E fields include physical, life, earth, ocean, atmospheric, computer, and social sciences; mathematics; engineering; and psychology. Advanced S&E degrees include master's and doctoral degrees. All S&E degrees include bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees but exclude associate's degrees.\n\nThe indicator value is obtained by dividing the number of advanced S&E degrees by the total number of S&E degrees awarded by the higher education institutions within the state. A high value shows that a state's higher education institutions are emphasizing S&E training at the graduate level.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-45\n\nTable 8-19 Advanced S&E degrees as share of S&E degrees conferred, by state: 1996, 2001, and 2005\n\nState\nUnited States...................

See table 8-20.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 During 2006, the total annual nominal charge for a full-time undergraduate student to attend a public 4-year institution averaged $12,108 nationally, an increase of 73% during the past decade in current dollars.\n\u00b7 All states showed major increases in undergraduate charges at public institutions in 2006 compared with 1996. In Oklahoma, Iowa, Nebraska, and Texas, undergraduate charges more than doubled during this period.\n\u00b7 In 2006, the state average for a year of undergraduate education at a public 4-year institution ranged from a low of $8,506 to a high of $17,708.\n\u00b7 Tuition and required fees averaged approximately 40% of the total charges at public 4-year institutions, but individual states had different cost structures.\n\nThe average annual charge for an undergraduate student to attend a public 4-year academic institution is one indicator of how accessible higher education in S&E is to a state's students. The annual charge includes standard in-state charges for tuition, required fees, room, and board for a full-time undergraduate student who is a resident of that state. These charges were weighted by the number of full-time undergraduates attending each public institution within the state. The total charge for all public 4-year institutions in the state was divided by the total number of full-time\n\nundergraduates attending all public 4-year institutions in the state. The year is the latter date of the academic year. For example, data for 2006 represent costs for the 2005\u00ad06 academic year.\nTo improve the educational attainment of their residents, many states have chosen to reduce the charge to students by providing state subsidies or direct financial aid.Additional financial aid is provided by the federal government and by the academic institutions. The data in this indicator do not include any adjustment for financial aid that a student might receive.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-47\n\nTable 8-20 Average undergraduate charge at public 4-year institutions, by state: 1996, 2001, and 2006\n(Dollars)\n\nState\nUnited States..........................................................................................

See table 8-21.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 In 2006 throughout the United States, a year of undergraduate education at a state institution would have consumed 38.2% of an average resident's disposable income, an increase from the 33.3% it would have consumed a decade earlier.\n\u00b7 The cost of a year of undergraduate education at a public institution consumed one-quarter to one-half of the per capita disposable income for residents of most states in 2006.\n\u00b7 Although a year of undergraduate education at a public institution became less affordable for residents in most states, affordability improved in six states during the past decade.\n\u00b7 Residents in Ohio, Iowa, South Carolina, and Nebraska experienced the steepest increases in the cost of a year of undergraduate education relative to their purchasing power (in excess of 10% of per capita disposable income) between 1996 and 2006.\n\nThis indicator provides a broad measure of the affordability of higher education at a public institution for the average resident. It is calculated by dividing the average undergraduate charge at all public 4-year institutions in the state by the per capita disposable personal income of state residents. The average undergraduate charge includes standard in-state tuition, room, board, and required fees for a student who is a resident of the state. Disposable personal income is the income that is available to state residents for spending\n\nor saving. It is calculated as personal income minus personal current taxes paid to federal, state, and local governments. The year is the latter date of the academic year. For example, data for 2006 represent costs for the 2005\u00ad06 academic year.\nHigh values indicate that a year of undergraduate education is more costly or less affordable to state residents. However, the data in this indicator do not include any adjustment for financial aid that a student might receive.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-49\n\nTable 8-21 Average undergraduate charge at public 4-year institutions as share of disposable personal income, by state: 1996, 2001, and 2006\n\nState\nUnited States...................

See Table 8-22.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 In the United States, the total amount of state financial aid from grants that were provided to undergraduates rose from nearly $2.9 billion in 1996 to nearly $6.8 billion in 2006.\n\u00b7 On a per-student basis, state expenditures for student grants across the United States increased from $427 in 1996 to $802 in 2006 in current dollars.\n\u00b7 The amount of financial assistance provided by the states and the District of Columbia varied greatly in 2006; 10 jurisdictions averaged less than $100 per undergraduate student, while 11 provided more than $1,000 per student, including South Carolina and Georgia with more than $2,000 per student.\n\u00b7 Four states reported spending less in current dollars for student financial aid in 2006 than in 1996 even though the cost of undergraduate education rose rapidly during this time period. All of these states were among the group spending less than $100 per undergraduate student.\n\nThe cost of an undergraduate education can be reduced with financial assistance from the state, federal government, or academic institution. This indicator measures the amount of financial support from state grants that go to undergraduate students at both public and private institutions in the state. It is calculated by dividing the total state grant aid to undergraduates by the number of full-time undergraduates who are attending school in the state. A high value is one indicator of state efforts to provide access to higher education at a time of escalating undergraduate costs.\n\nThis indicator should be viewed relative to the level of tuition charged to undergraduates in a state because some states have chosen to subsidize tuition for all students at public institutions rather than provide grants.\nTotal state grant expenditures for financial aid include both needbased and non-need-based grants. State assistance through subsidized or unsubsidized loans and awards to students at the graduate and first professional degree levels is not included. The year is the latter date of the academic year. For example, data for 2006 represent costs for the 2005\u00ad06 academic year.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-51\n\nTable 8-22 State expenditures on student aid per full-time undergraduate student, by state: 1996, 2001, and 2006\n\nState\nUnited States.................

See table 8-23.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 The early- to mid-career population with at least an associate's degree was 37.4% nationwide in 2005, which represents an increase from 34.7% in 2000.\n\u00b7 Only Alaska failed to show an increase in the percentage of its early career population with at least an associate's degree between 2000 and 2005. Eighteen states had 2005 values below the 2000 national average of 34.7% compared with 27 states with values below this level in 2000.\n\u00b7 In 2005, the percentage of this cohort with at least an associate's degree varied greatly among states, ranging from 50.4% to 26.2%. States with the lowest cost of living tended to rank lowest on this indicator.\n\nThis indicator represents the percentage of the early- to mid-career population that has earned at least a college degree. That degree may be at the associate's through doctoral level. The indicator represents where college degree holders have chosen to live and work rather than where they were educated. The age cohort of 25\u00ad44 years represents the group most likely to have completed a college program. High values indicate a resident population or potential workforce with widespread credentials at the community college level or higher.\n\nEstimates of educational attainment are developed by the Census Bureau based on the 2000 Decennial Census and the American Community Survey (ACS). The census is conducted every 10 years, but the ACS provides annually updated data on the characteristics of population and housing. In 2005, ACS became the largest household survey in the United States, with an annual sample size of about 3 million addresses. Estimates of population are taken from the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program, which is also based on the 2000 Decennial Census.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-53\n\nTable 8-23 Associate's degree holders or higher among individuals 25\u00ad44 years old, by state: 2000, 2003, and 2005\n\nState\nUnited States.................

See table 8-24.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 The early- to mid-career population with at least a bachelor's degree was 29.0% nationwide in 2005, which represents an increase from 26.8% in 2000.\n\u00b7 Only Hawaii failed to show an increase in the percentage of its early career population with at least a bachelor's degree between 2000 and 2005. Twenty states had 2005 values below the 2000 national average of 26.8% compared with 30 states with values below this level in 2000.\n\u00b7 In 2005, the percentage of the early career population with at least a bachelor's degree varied greatly among states, ranging from 42.2% to 19.1%. States with the lowest cost of living tended to rank lowest on this indicator.\n\nThis indicator represents the percentage of the early- to mid-career population that has earned at least a 4-year undergraduate degree. That degree may be at the bachelor's through doctoral level. The indicator represents where college degree holders have chosen to live and work rather than where they were educated. The age cohort of 25\u00ad44 years represents the group most likely to have completed a college program. High values indicate a resident population or potential workforce with widespread credentials at the college or university level.\n\nEstimates of educational attainment are developed by the Census Bureau based on the 2000 Decennial Census and the American Community Survey (ACS). The census is conducted every 10 years, but the ACS provides annually updated data on the characteristics of population and housing. In 2005, ACS became the largest household survey in the United States, with an annual sample size of about 3 million addresses. Estimates of population are taken from the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program, which is also based on the 2000 Decennial Census.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-55\n\nTable 8-24 Bachelor's degree holders or higher among individuals 25\u00ad44 years old, by state: 2000, 2003, and 2005\n\nState\nUnited States.................

See table 8-25.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 In 2005, 45 million individuals between the ages of 25 and 64 held bachelor's degrees in the United States, up from 39 million in 2000. Nationwide, the ratio of bachelor's degree holders to the size of the workforce rose from 28.5% in 2000 to 31.7% in 2005. This ratio varied considerably among the states, ranging from 22.5% to 43.2% in 2005.\n\u00b7 The value of this indicator increased in all states and the District of Columbia between 2000 and 2005. This may reflect a replacement of older cohorts of workers with younger, more educated ones. It may also indicate the restructuring of state economies to emphasize work that requires a higher level of education or credentials.\n\u00b7 Between 2000 and 2005, Michigan, Massachusetts, and the District of Columbia showed the largest increases in the ratio of bachelor's degree holders to workforce size.\n\u00b7 The geographic distribution of bachelor's degree holders bears little resemblance to any of the degree production indicators, which attests to the considerable mobility of the college-educated population in the United States.\n\nThe ratio of bachelor's, graduate, or professional degree holders to the size of a state's workforce is an indicator of a population with undergraduate and/or graduate education skill levels potentially available for its workforce. Workers with at least a bachelor's degree have a clear advantage over less-educated workers in expected lifetime earnings. A high value for this indicator suggests a large percentage of the potential workforce with an undergraduate education. This indicator does not imply that all degree holders are currently employed; rather, it indicates the potential educational level of the workforce if all degree holders were employed. Knowledge-intensive businesses seeking to relocate may be attracted to states with high values on this indicator.\n\nDegree data are based on the U.S. Census Bureau's 2000 Decennial Census and American Community Survey and are limited to individuals who are 25\u00ad64 years old because this is the age range of most of the workforce. Individuals younger than age 25 are considered to be in the process of completing their education. Individuals older than 64 are considered to be largely retired, so their educational attainment would have limited applicability to the quality of the workforce. Civilian workforce data are Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates based on Local Area Unemployment Statistics. Estimates for sparsely populated states and the District of Columbia may be imprecise because of their small representation in the survey samples.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-57\n\nTable 8-25 Bachelor's degree holders potentially in the workforce, by state: 2000, 2003, and 2005\n\nState\nUnited States.................

See table 8-26.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 In 2006, 3.7% of the U.S. workforce, or about 5.4 million people, worked in occupations classified as S&E.\n\u00b7 The percentage of the workforce engaged in S&E occupations ranged from 1.9% to 6.5% in individual states in 2006.\n\u00b7 The highest percentage of S&E occupations was found in the District of Columbia and the adjacent states of Maryland and Virginia as well as in Massachusetts, Washington, and Colorado.\n\u00b7 Between 2004 and 2006, the percentage of S&E occupations increased in 29 states and the District of Columbia, and it decreased in 18 states.\n\nThis indicator shows the extent to which a state's workforce is employed in S&E occupations. A high value for this indicator shows that a state's economy has a high percentage of technical jobs relative to other states.\nS&E occupations are defined by standard occupational codes that encompass mathematical, computer, life, physical, and social scientists; engineers; and postsecondary teachers in any of these S&E fields. Managers, technicians, elementary and secondary schoolteachers, and medical personnel are excluded.\n\nThe location of S&E occupations primarily reflects where the individuals work and is based on estimates from the Occupational Employment Statistics survey, a cooperative program between the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and state employment security agencies. Civilian workforce data are BLS estimates based on the Current Population Survey, which assigns workers to a location based on residence. Because of this difference and the sample-based nature of the data, estimates for sparsely populated states and the District of Columbia may be imprecise.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-59\n\nTable 8-26 Individuals in S&E occupations as share of workforce, by state: 2004 and 2006\n\nState\nUnited States...............................

See table 8-27.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 The number of employed S&E doctorate holders in the United States rose from 517,000 in 1997 to 618,000 in 2006, an increase of 20%.\n\u00b7 For the United States, the value of this indicator rose from 0.39% to 0.43% of the workforce because the number of employed S&E doctorate holders increased more rapidly than the size of the workforce during this period.\n\u00b7 In 2006, the values for this indicator in individual states ranged from 0.20% to 1.00% of the state's workforce; the District of Columbia was an outlier at 4.49%, reflecting the fact that there are many government offices, colleges and universities, and government contractors in the area that employ scientists and engineers.\n\u00b7 States in the top quartile tend to be home to major research laboratories, research universities, or research-intensive industries.\n\nThis indicator shows a state's ability to attract and retain highly trained scientists and engineers. These individuals often conduct R&D, manage R&D activities, or are otherwise engaged in knowledge-intensive activities. A high value for this indicator in a state suggests employment opportunities for individuals with highly advanced training in S&E.\nS&E fields include physical, life, earth, ocean, atmospheric, computer, and social sciences; mathematics; engineering; and psychology. S&E doctorate data derive from NSF's\n\nSurvey of Doctorate Recipients, which excludes those with doctorates from foreign institutions. The location of the employed doctorate holders primarily reflects the state in which the individuals work. Civilian workforce data are Bureau of Labor Statistics' estimates from the Local Area Unemployment Statistics, which bases location on residence. Because of this difference and the sample-based nature of the data, estimates for sparsely populated states and the District of Columbia may be imprecise.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-61\n\nTable 8-27 Employed S&E doctorate holders as share of workforce, by state: 1997, 2001, and 2006\n\nState\nUnited States..................

See table 8-28.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 In the United States, 1.54 million individuals were employed in engineering occupations in 2006, an increase over the 1.48 million engineers employed in 2004. During this period, the percentage of the workforce employed in engineering occupations remained unchanged at 1.06%.\n\u00b7 The concentration of engineers in individual states ranged from 0.53% to 2.11% in 2006.\n\u00b7 The District of Columbia was an outlier at 3.00%, reflecting the fact that there are many government offices, colleges and universities, and government contractors in the area that employ scientists and engineers.\n\u00b7 Between 2004 and 2006, the percentage of engineers in the workforce increased in 28 states and decreased in 17 states and the District of Columbia.\n\u00b7 States in the top quartile for this indicator tended to have a relatively high concentration of hightechnology businesses.\n\nThis indicator shows the extent to which a state's workforce includes trained engineers. The indicator encompasses the standard occupational codes for engineering fields such as aerospace, agricultural, biomedical, chemical, civil, computer hardware, electrical and electronics, environmental, industrial, marine and naval architectural, materials, mechanical, mining and geological, nuclear, and petroleum. Engineers design and operate production processes and create new products and services.\nThe location of engineering occupations primarily reflects where\n\nthe individuals work and is based on estimates from the Occupational Employment Statistics survey, a cooperative program between the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and state employment security agencies. The size of a state's civilian workforce is estimated from the BLS Current Population Survey, which assigns workers to a location based on residence. Because of this difference and the sample-based nature of the data, estimates for sparsely populated states and the District of Columbia may be imprecise.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-63\n\nTable 8-28 Engineers as share of workforce, by state: 2004 and 2006\n\nState\nUnited States...............................

See Table 8-29.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 Nearly 578,000 individuals, or 0.40% of the workforce, were employed as life and physical scientists in the United States in 2006, an increase over the 546,000 life and physical scientists employed in 2004, which was 0.39% of the workforce.\n\u00b7 In 2006, individual states had indicator values ranging from 0.22% to 0.93%, which showed major differences in the concentration of jobs in the life and physical sciences.\n\u00b7 The District of Columbia was an outlier at 2.15%, reflecting the fact that there are many government offices, colleges and universities, and government contractors in the area that employ scientists and engineers.\n\u00b7 Between 2004 and 2006, the percentage of life and physical scientists in the workforce increased in 18 states and the District of Columbia and decreased in 11 states.\n\nThis indicator shows a state's ability to attract and retain life and physical scientists. Life scientists are identified from standard occupational codes that include agricultural and food scientists, biological scientists, conservation scientists and foresters, and medical scientists. Physical scientists are identified from standard occupational codes that include astronomers, physicists, atmospheric and space scientists, chemists, materials scientists, environmental scientists, and geoscientists, and postsecondary teachers in these subject areas. A high share of life and physical scientists could indicate several scenarios ranging from a robust cluster of life sciences companies to a high percentage of acreage in forests or national parks.\n\nThe latter requires foresters, wildlife specialists, and conservationists to manage the natural assets in an area with low population density.\nThe location of life and physical scientists reflects where the individuals work and is based on estimates from the Occupational Employment Statistics survey, a cooperative program between the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and state employment security agencies. The size of a state's civilian workforce is estimated from the BLS Current Population Survey, which assigns workers to a location based on residence. Because of this difference and the sample-based nature of the data, estimates for sparsely populated states and the District of Columbia may be imprecise.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-65\n\nTable 8-29 Life and physical scientists as share of workforce, by state: 2004 and 2006\n\nState\nUnited States...............................

This may be due to the fact that there are many government offices, colleges and universities, and government contractors in the area that employ scientists and engineers, especially computer scientists.\n\u00b7 Between 2004 and 2006, the percentage of computer specialists in the workforce increased in 31 states and the District of Columbia and decreased in 18 states.\n\nThis indicator shows the extent to which a state's workforce makes use of specialists with advanced computer training. Computer specialists are identified from 10 standard occupational codes that include computer and information scientists, programmers, software engineers, support specialists, systems analysts, database administrators, and network and computer system administrators. States with higher values may indicate a state workforce that is better able to thrive in an information economy or to embrace and utilize computer technology.\n\nThe location of computer specialists reflects where the individuals work and is based on estimates from the Occupational Employment Statistics survey, a cooperative program between the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and state employment security agencies. The size of a state's civilian workforce is estimated from the BLS Current Population Survey, which assigns workers to a location based on residence.

See Table 8-31.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 The national value of R&D expenditures as a share of GDP has varied from 2.47% in 1998 to 2.44% in 2004.\n\u00b7 In 2004, state values for this indicator ranged from 0.41% to 8.01%, indicating large differences in the geographic concentration of R&D.\n\u00b7 New Mexico is an outlier on this indicator because of the presence of large federal R&D activities and a relatively small GDP.\n\u00b7 Between 1998 and 2004, the value of this indicator increased in 31 states and declined in 18 states and the District of Columbia.\n\u00b7 States with high rankings on this indicator also tended to rank high on S&E doctorate holders as a share of the workforce.\n\nThis indicator shows the extent to which R&D play a role in a state's economy. A high value indicates that the state has a high intensity of R&D activity, which may support future growth in knowledge-based industries. Industries that have a high percentage of R&D activity include pharmaceuticals, chemicals, computer equipment and services, electronic components, aerospace, and motor vehicles. R&D refers to R&D activities performed by federal agencies, industry, universities, and other nonprofit organizations. At the national level in 2004, industry\n\nperformed roughly 71% of total R&D, followed by colleges and universities at 15%; government facilities, including federally funded R&D centers, at 12%; and nonprofit institutions at 2%. Data for the value of gross domestic product (GDP) and for R&D expenditures are shown in current dollars.\nThe methodology for assigning R&D activity at the state level was modified in 2001, and data back to 1998 were recalculated using the new methodology. State-level R&D data from years before 1998 are not comparable.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-69\n\nTable 8-31 R&D as share of gross domestic product, by state: 1998, 2001, and 2004\n\nState\nUnited States.................

See Table 8-32.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 Federal R&D obligations rose from $67 billion in 1995 to nearly $107 billion in 2005, an increase of 59% in current dollars.\n\u00b7 The increase in federal R&D obligations (in current dollars) was greater than the increase in the civilian workforce causing the value of this indicator to rise from $532 per worker in 1995 to $753 per worker in 2005.\n\u00b7 Federal R&D obligations in 2005 varied greatly among the states, ranging from $121 to $4,329 per worker. Higher values were found in the states surrounding the District of Columbia and in sparsely populated states with national laboratories or federal facilities.\n\u00b7 The District of Columbia was an outlier with $13,588 per worker in 2005, possibly because many federal employees work there but live in neighboring states.\n\u00b7 Between 1995 and 2005, the value of R&D obligations per worker increased in 44 states and the District of Columbia and decreased in 6 states.\n\nThis indicator shows how federal R&D funding is disbursed geographically relative to the size of states' civilian workforces. Because the Department of Defense is the primary source for federal R&D obligations, much of this funding is used for development, but it also may provide direct and indirect benefits to a state's economy and may stimulate the conduct of basic research. A high value may indicate the existence of major federally funded R&D facilities in the state.\n\nFederal R&D dollars are attributed to the states in which the recipients of federal obligations are located. The size of a state's civilian workforce is estimated based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey, which assigns workers to a location based on residence. Because of these differences and the sample-based nature of the population data, estimates for sparsely populated states and the District of Columbia may be imprecise.\n\n\fScience and Engineering

See Table 8-33.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 The federal government obligated nearly $107 billion for R&D in 2005, more than $20,000 for each person employed in an S&E occupation.\n\u00b7 The distribution for this indicator was highly skewed in 2005, with only 13 states and the District of Columbia above the national average. High values were reported in the District of Columbia and adjoining states and also in states where federal facilities or major defense contractors are located.\n\u00b7 The state distribution of federal R&D obligations per person employed in an S&E occupation ranged from $3,835 to $100,808 in 2005.\n\u00b7 Between 2003 and 2005, the value of this indicator increased in 25 states and the District of Columbia and decreased in 25 states. The largest increases in indicator value occurred in Missouri, West Virginia, and Maryland, and the largest decreases in Mississippi.\n\nThis indicator demonstrates how federal R&D obligations are distributed geographically based on individuals with a bachelor's or higher degree who work in S&E occupations. These positions include mathematical, computer, life, physical, and social scientists; engineers; and postsecondary teachers in any of these fields. Positions such as managers and elementary and secondary schoolteachers are excluded. A\n\nhigh value may indicate the existence of major federally funded R&D facilities or the presence of large defense or other federal contractors in the state.\nFederal R&D dollars are counted where they are obligated but may be expended in many locations. Data on people in S&E occupations are sample based. For these reasons, estimates for sparsely populated states and the District of Columbia may be imprecise.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-73\n\nTable 8-33 Federal R&D obligations per individual in S&E occupation, by state: 2003 and 2005\n\nState\nUnited States.................

See Table 8-34.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 The amount of R&D performed by industry rose from $164 billion in 1998 to $222 billion in 2005, an increase of 36% (unadjusted for inflation).\n\u00b7 The value of this indicator for the United States has shown a downward trend over the past 7 years; starting at 2.14% in 1998, it declined to 2.03% in 2002 and has held steady through 2005.\n\u00b7 Industrial R&D is concentrated in a few states--only 14 states had indicator values exceeding the national average in 2005.\n\u00b7 States with high values for this indicator were usually located on the West Coast or the northern half of the East Coast.\n\nThis indicator measures the emphasis that private industry places on R&D. Industrial R&D focuses on projects that are expected to yield new or improved products, processes, or services and to bring direct benefits to the company. A high value for this indicator shows that the companies and industries within a state are making major investments in their R&D activities.\nDifferences among states on this indicator should be interpreted with caution. Because industries differ in their reliance on R&D, the indicator\n\nreflects state differences in industrial structure as much as the behavior of individual companies. Furthermore, industrial R&D data for states with small economies may be based on data imputed from previous years' survey results and imprecise estimates.\nThe methodology for making statelevel assignments of the industrial R&D reported by companies with operations in multiple states changed in 1998. Industrial R&D data from years before 1998 are not comparable.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-75\n\nTable 8-34 Industry-performed R&D as share of private-industry output, by state: 1998, 2002, and 2005\n\nState\nUnited States.................

See table 8-35.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 Expenditures for research performed in academic institutions have doubled in a decade, rising from $21.6 billion in 1995 to $44.9 billion in 2005 (unadjusted for inflation).\n\u00b7 In the United States, academic research increased more rapidly than GDP, causing the value of this indicator to increase by 21% between 1995 and 2005. During this period, 45 states reported increases in the value of this indicator and 5 states and the District of Columbia showed decreases.\n\u00b7 The largest percentage increases in academic R&D as a share of GDP occurred in Hawaii and Mississippi, where the value of this indicator approximately doubled between 1995 and 2005.\n\u00b7 States ranking high on the intensity of academic research usually did not rank high on the intensity of industrial research.\n\nThis indicator measures the extent of spending on academic research performed in a state relative to the size of the state's economy. Academic R&D is more basic and less product oriented than R&D performed by industry. It can be a valuable basis for future economic development. High values for this indicator may reflect an academic R&D system that can compete for funding from federal, state, and industrial sources.\n\nIn this indicator, Maryland data exclude expenditures by the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) at the Johns Hopkins University. APL employs more than 3,000 people and supports the Department of Defense, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and other government agencies rather than focusing on academic research. Data for the value of gross domestic product (GDP) by state and for R&D expenditures are shown in current dollars.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-77\n\nTable 8-35 Academic R&D per $1,000 of gross domestic product, by state: 1995, 2000, and 2005\n\nState\nUnited States.................

See table 8-36.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 In 2005, nearly 28,000 S&E doctorates were awarded by U.S. academic institutions, approximately 10% more than in 2001 and 3% more than in 1997.\n\u00b7 Nationwide, the value of this indicator declined between 1997 and 2003, reflecting an increase in the stock of S&E doctorate holders living in the United States.\n\u00b7 This indicator is volatile for many states and may reflect the migration patterns of existing S&E doctorate holders.\n\nThis indicator provides a measure of the rate at which the states are training new S&E doctorate recipients for entry into the workforce. High values indicate relatively large production of new doctorate holders compared with the existing stock. Some states with relatively low values may need to attract S&E doctorate holders from elsewhere to meet the needs of local employers.\nThis indicator does not account for the mobility of recent S&E doctorate recipients, which is very high. Foreignborn graduate students may decide to return home after graduation to begin\n\ntheir careers. Most recent doctorate recipients are influenced by the location of employment opportunities.\nU.S. S&E doctorate holders include those in the physical, life, earth, ocean, atmospheric, computer, and social sciences; mathematics; engineering; and psychology. Medical doctorates are excluded. The population of doctorate holders for this indicator consisted of all individuals under age 76 years who received a research doctorate in science or engineering from a U.S. institution and were residing in the United States.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-79\n\nTable 8-36 S&E doctorates conferred per 1,000 S&E doctorate holders, by state: 1997, 2001, 2005, and 2006\n\nState\nUnited States.................

See table 8-37.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 Between 1997 and 2005, the number of scientific and technical articles increased by 16% and the number of S&E doctorate holders increased by nearly the same percentage, causing the value of this indicator to remain almost unchanged for the United States.\n\u00b7 The publication rate for academic S&E doctorate holders in states in the top quartile of this indicator was approximately twice as high as for states in the bottom quartile.\n\u00b7 States with the greatest volatility on this indicator frequently had larger changes in academic employment than in number of publications; this may indicate that academic article output is lower at the beginning and end of academic careers.\n\u00b7 In 2003, the states with the highest values for this indicator were distributed across the nation.\n\nThe volume of peer-reviewed articles per 1,000 academic S&E doctorate holders is an approximate measure of their contribution to scientific knowledge. Publications are only one measure of academic productivity, which includes trained personnel, patents, and other outputs. A high value on this indicator shows that the S&E faculty in a state's academic institutions are generating a high volume of publications relative to other states. Academic institutions include both 2-year and 4-year schools.\nPublication counts are based on the number of articles appearing in\n\na set of journals listed in Thomson ISI's Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index. The number of journals in this set was 5,029 in 1997, 5,255 in 2001, and 5,161 in 2005. Articles with authors in different institutions were counted fractionally. For a publication with N authors, each author's institution was credited with 1/N articles.\nS&E doctorates include physical, life, earth, ocean, atmospheric, computer, and social sciences; mathematics; engineering; and psychology. Medical doctorates and S&E doctorates from foreign institutions are excluded.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-81\n\nTable 8-37 Academic article output per 1,000 S&E doctorate holders in academia, by state: 1997, 2001, 2005, and 2006\n\nState\nUnited States.................

See table 8-38.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 From 1995 to 2005, the number of academic publications rose from 146,000 to nearly 168,000, an increase of 15%.\n\u00b7 In 2005, academic researchers produced an average of 4.3 publications per $1 million of academic R&D, compared with 7.5 in 1995. This partly reflects the effect of general price inflation (28% during this time period), but may also indicate rising academic research costs.\n\u00b7 The value for this indicator decreased for all states between 1995 and 2005.\n\nThis indicator shows the relationship between the number of academic publications and the expenditure for academic R&D. A high value for this indicator means that a state's academic institutions have a high publications output relative to their R&D spending. Academic institutions include both 2-year and 4-year schools. This indicator is not an efficiency measure; it is affected by the highly variable costs of R&D and by publishing conventions in different fields and institutions. It may reflect variations in field emphasis among states and institutions.\nPublication counts are based on the number of articles appearing in a set of journals listed in Thomson ISI's Science\n\nCitation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index. The number of journals in this set was 4,601 in 1993, 5,084 in 1998, and 5,161 in 2005. Articles with authors in different institutions were counted fractionally. For a publication with N authors, each author's institution was credited with 1/N articles. In this indicator, Maryland data exclude expenditures by the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) at the Johns Hopkins University. APL employs more than 3,000 workers and supports the Department of Defense, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and other government agencies rather than focusing on academic research.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-83\n\nTable 8-38 Academic article output per $1 million of academic R&D, by state: 1995, 2000, and 2005\n\nState\nUnited States.................

See table 8-39.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 Throughout the United States, the number of patents awarded to academic institutions increased from more than 2,400 in 1997 to more than 2,700 in 2005, an increase of 11%, while the number of academic S&E doctorate holders rose by 20% between 1997 and 2006.\n\u00b7 In 2005, 9.2 academic patents were produced nationally for each 1,000 S&E doctorate holders employed in academia, slightly lower than the 10.0 patents produced in 1997.\n\u00b7 In 2003, states varied widely on this indicator, with values ranging from 0 to 20.2 patents per 1,000 S&E doctorate holders employed in academia, indicating a difference in patenting philosophy or mix of industries that these academic institutions deal with.\n\u00b7 California and Massachusetts showed both the highest levels of academic patenting activity and the highest levels of venture capital investment.\n\nSince the early 1980s, academic institutions have increasingly been viewed as engines of economic growth. Growing attention has been paid to the results of academic R&D in terms of their role in creating new products, processes, and services. One indicator of such R&D results is volume of academic patents. Academic patenting is highly concentrated and partly reflects the resources devoted to institutional patenting offices.\nThis indicator relates the number of academic-owned utility patents to the size of the doctoral S&E workforce in academia. Academia includes both 2-year and 4-year institutions. Utility patents, commonly\n\nknown as patents for inventions, include any new, useful, or improved method, process, machine, device, manufactured item, or chemical compound, and represent a key measure of intellectual property. This indicator is an approximate measure of the degree to which results with perceived economic value are generated by the doctoral academic workforce.\nS&E doctorates include physical, life, earth, ocean, atmospheric, computer, and social sciences; mathematics; engineering; and psychology. Medical doctorates and S&E doctorates from foreign institutions are excluded.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-85\n\nTable 8-39 Academic patents awarded per 1,000 S&E doctorate holders in academia, by state: 1997, 2001, 2005, and 2006\n\nState\nUnited States.................

See table 8-40.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 Nearly 90,000 utility patents were awarded to inventors residing in the United States in 2006, an increase of almost 7% from the 84,000 utility patents awarded in 2004.\n\u00b7 In 2006, the national average for this indicator was 16.7 patents per 1,000 individuals in an S&E occupation, which was slightly higher than the average of 16.6 in 2004.\n\u00b7 The state of Idaho typically reports the highest values for this indicator, reflecting the presence of a highpatenting Department of Energy National Laboratory in this sparsely populated state. In 2006, this may not be evident because the Idaho data for individuals in S&E occupations were suppressed.\n\u00b7 Values for the remaining states varied widely, ranging from 3.4 to 34.2 patents per 1,000 individuals in S&E occupations in 2006.\n\u00b7 Nearly 25% of all 2006 U.S. utility patents were awarded to residents of California.\n\nThis indicator shows state patent activity normalized to the size of its S&E workforce, specifically employees in S&E occupations. People in S&E occupations include mathematical, computer, life, physical, and social scientists; engineers; and postsecondary teachers in any of these fields. Managers, technicians, elementary and secondary schoolteachers, and medical personnel are excluded.\nAlthough the Patent and Trademark Office grants several types of patents, this indicator includes only utility patents, commonly known as patents for inventions. Utility patents can be granted for any new, useful, or improved method, process, machine, device, manufactured item, or chemical compound, and represent a key\n\nmeasure of intellectual property. The Patent and Trademark Office classifies patents based on the residence of the first-named inventor. Only U.S.-origin patents are included.\nThe location of S&E occupations primarily reflects where the individuals work and is based on estimates from the Occupational Employment Statistics survey, a cooperative program between the Bureau of Labor Statistics and state employment security agencies. Because of the different methods of assigning geographic location, this indicator is of limited applicability for sparsely populated states or for locations where a large percentage of the population lives in one state or region and works in another.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-87\n\nTable 8-40 Patents awarded per 1,000 individuals in S&E occupations, by state: 2004 and 2006\n\nState\nUnited States...............................

However, in 22 states the high-technology share of all business establishments declined in 2004 relative to 2003.\n\u00b7 Between 2003 and 2004, the largest growth in the number of establishments in hightechnology industries occurred in Florida and California, which added 2,000 and 1,700 establishments, respectively.\n\u00b7 The state distribution of this indicator is similar to that of three other indicators: bachelor's degree holders, S&E doctoral degree holders, and S&E occupations, all expressed as a share of the workforce.\n\nThis indicator measures the portion of a state's business establishments that are classified as high-technology industries. High-technology industries are defined as those in which the proportion of employees in technology-oriented occupations is at least twice the average proportion for all industries. State economies with a high percentage of business establishments in high-technology industries are likely to be well positioned to take advantage of new technological developments.\n\nThe data pertaining to establishments for the years 2003 and 2004 were based on their classification according to the 2002 edition of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). A list of the 46 industries (by 4-digit NAICS code) that are defined as high-technology can be found in the Technical Note at the end of this chapter. Data for earlier years are not directly comparable.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-89\n\nTable 8-41 High-technology share of all business establishments, by state: 2003 and 2004\n\nState\nUnited States.................

From a base of approximately 7 million total business establishments, 84,155 new business establishments were formed in high-technology industries and 72,557 ceased operation in those same industries.\n\u00b7 Net business formations cannot be used to directly link the number of high-technology business establishments in 2003 and 2004. In addition to the births and deaths that occurred during 2004, the total number of 2004 high-technology establishments also includes business establishments that were reclassified during 2004. There were 12,387 establishments that were in operation in both 2003 and 2004 and were classified in a high-technology NAICS code in 2003 but not in 2004. Similarly, there were 14,014 establishments that were in operation in both 2003 and 2004 that were not classified with a high-technology NAICS code in 2003 but acquired one in 2004.\n\u00b7 Four states had net losses of business establishments in hightechnology industries in 2004.\n\u00b7 Utah and Virginia showed the highest rates of net hightechnology business formations in 2004. However, the largest numbers of net new businesses were formed in Florida and California.\n\nThe business base of a state is constantly changing as new businesses form and others cease to function. The term net business formations refers to the difference between the number of businesses that are formed and the number that cease operations during any particular year. This difference can be small or can vary considerably from year to year.\nThe ratio of the number of net business formations that occur in high-technology industries to the number of business establishments in a state indicates the changing role of high-technology industries in a state's economy. High positive values indicate an increasingly prominent role for these industries.\n\nThe data on business establishments in high-technology industries for 2003 and 2004 were based on their classification according to the 2002 edition of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). A list of the 46 industries (by 4-digit NAICS code) that are defined as high-technology can be found in the Technical Note at the end of this chapter. Data for earlier years are not directly comparable. Company births and deaths are determined from Employer Identification Numbers in the Census Bureau records; thus, changes in company name, ownership, or address are not counted as business formations or business deaths.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-91\n\nTable 8-42 Net high-technology business formations as share of all business establishments, by state: 2004\n\nState\nUnited States..........................................................................

High-technology industries are defined as those in which the proportion of employees in technology-oriented occupations is at least twice the average proportion for all industries.

See table 8-44.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 Strong growth has occurred in the SBIR program in recent years as total annual awards have increased from nearly $1 billion in 1995\u00ad97 to nearly $1.9 billion in 2003\u00ad05.\n\u00b7 The value of SBIR awards is not evenly distributed but is concentrated in relatively few states; the total of annual state awards may range from under $1 million to nearly $400 million.\n\u00b7 Many of the states with the highest rankings on this indicator are locations of federal laboratories or well-recognized academic research institutions from which innovative small businesses have emerged.\n\u00b7 States with a high ranking on this indicator also tend to rank high on the hightechnology and venture capital indicators.\n\nFunds awarded through the federal Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program support technological innovation in small companies (i.e., companies with 500 or fewer employees). Awards are made to evaluate the feasibility and scientific merit of new technology (up to $100,000) and to develop the technology to a point where it can be commercialized (up to $750,000). The total award dollars include both Phase 1 and Phase 2 SBIR awards.\n\nBecause of year-to-year fluctuations, this indicator is calculated using 3-year averages. The average annual SBIR award dollars won by small businesses in a state are divided by the average annual gross domestic product. A high value indicates that small business firms in a state are doing cutting-edge development work that attracts federal support.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-95\n\nTable 8-44 Average annual federal SBIR funding per $1 million of gross domestic product, by state: 1995\u00ad97, 1999\u00ad2001, and 2003\u00ad05\n\nState\nUnited States.................

See table 8-45.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 The amount of venture capital invested in the United States increased approximately 10-fold, from only $11 billion in 1996 to a record $106 billion in 2000, before falling to $26 billion in 2006 (in current dollars).\n\u00b7 In 2006, the state average for venture capital disbursed per $1,000 GDP was $1.98, which was larger than the $1.47 invested in 1996 but only about one-half the fraction of GDP invested in 2001.\n\u00b7 Venture capital is concentrated in relatively few states. Companies in California received 48% of the total venture capital disbursed in the United States in 2006, followed by companies in Massachusetts with 11%.\n\u00b7 The distribution of venture capital among states is becoming more limited. Twenty-one states reported lower values for this indicator in 2006 than in 1996.\n\u00b7 The state distribution of venture capital was similar to that for the high-technology indicators.\n\nVenture capital represents an important source of funding for startup companies. This indicator shows the relative magnitude of venture capital investments in a state after adjusting for the size of the state's economy. The indicator is expressed as dollars of venture capital disbursed per $1,000 of gross domestic product (GDP). A high value indicates that companies in those states are successfully attracting venture capital to fuel their growth.\n\nVenture capital investments represent a method of funding the growth and expansion of companies early in their development before establishing a predictable sales history that would qualify them for other types of financing. Access to this type of financing varies greatly in different states.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-97\n\nTable 8-45 Venture capital disbursed per $1,000 of gross domestic product, by state: 1996, 2001, and 2006\n\nState\nUnited States.................

See table 8-46.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 The number of venture capital deals that involved U.S. companies fell from a high of 7,900 deals in 2000 to a fairly consistent value of 2,900\u00ad3,100 deals annually during the period of 2002\u00ad04.\n\u00b7 In 2004, the distribution of venture capital among hightechnology companies was uneven between states. Companies in only five states exceeded the national average of 0.50%.\n\u00b7 Companies in high-technology industries located in Massachusetts were the most successful in accessing venture capital investments in 2004 with a 2.1% rate. This was less than half the rate of Massachusetts companies that received such funding in 2000. California companies in hightechnology industries obtained venture capitol investment at a rate of 1.6%. No other states exceeded a rate of 1%.\n\u00b7 In 2004, no venture capital deals were reported in Alaska, Montana, or Nebraska.\n\nThis indicator provides a measure of the extent to which high-technology companies in a state receive venture capital investments. The value of the indicator is calculated by dividing the number of venture capital deals by the number of companies operating in hightechnology industries in that state. In most cases, a company will not receive more than one infusion of venture capital in a given year.\n\nVenture capital investment can bring needed capital and management expertise that can help to grow a high-technology company. High values indicate that high-technology companies in a state are frequently using venture capital to facilitate their growth and development.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-99\n\nTable 8-46 Venture capital deals as share of high-technology business establishments, by state: 2003 and 2004\n\nState\nUnited States.................

See table 8-47.\n\nFindings\n\u00b7 The size of the average venture capital investment in the United States rose over the past decade to more than $7 million per deal in 2006. This average represented an increase in investment size from $4 million per deal in 1996 and $5 million per deal in 1998 but a decline from $13 million per deal in 2000.\n\u00b7 The total number of venture capital deals began to rise again during the past few years, increasing from 2,872 in 2004 to 3,519 in 2006.\n\u00b7 The state distribution on this indicator was skewed in 2006; only 11 states and the District of Columbia were above the national average, and 7 states reported no venture capital investments.\n\u00b7 The value of this indicator has shown a high level of variability during the past decade both at the national level and for individual states.\n\nThis indicator provides a measure of the average size of the venture capital investments being made in a state. The indicator is expressed as the total dollars of venture capital invested in millions divided by the number of companies receiving venture capital. The availability of venture capital may vary widely based on local business climate and entrepreneurial activity. The amount also will vary by stage of investment and type of company.\nThis indicator provides some measure of the magnitude of investment that developing companies in a specific state have attracted from venture capital sources. High values indicate a large average deal size.\n\nSome states have relatively few venture capital deals taking place in a given year; thus, the value of this indicator may show large fluctuations on a year-to-year basis. This variation is further compounded by the large change in total venture capital investments that has occurred since 2000, making the use of a 3-year average of state investments misleading. Twentythree states reported fewer than 10 venture capital deals in 2006. In such states, a single large or small venture capital investment can significantly affect the value of this indicator.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n 8-101\n\nTable 8-47 Venture capital disbursed per venture capital deal, by state: 1996, 2001, and 2006\n\nState\nUnited States.................

State Indicators\n\nTechnical Note: Defining High-Technology Industries\nAlthough there is no consensus on the identity of hightechnology industries, this chapter utilizes a modification of the approach employed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). That approach is based on the intensity of high-technology employment within an industry. High-technology occupations include scientific, engineering, and technician occupations. These occupations employ workers who possess an in-depth\n\nknowledge of the theories and principles of science, engineering, and mathematics, which are generally acquired through postsecondary education in some field of technology. An industry is considered a high-technology industry if employment in technology-oriented occupations accounts for a proportion of that industry's total employment that is at least twice the 4.9% average for all industries (i.e., 9.8% or higher). Level I high-technology industries include the 14 industries in which technology-oriented employment is at least 5 times the average for all industries, or 24.7%. Level II high-technology industries\n\nTable 8-48 2002 NAICS codes that constitute high-technology industries\n\nNAICS code\n\nIndustry\n\nLevel I industries 3254........................................

Level III high-technology industries include the 20 industries with a proportion of high-technology employment that is 2.0\u00ad2.9 times the industry average or 9.8%\u00ad14.7% of total employment.\nIn each case, the industry is defined by a four-digit code that is based on the listings in the 2002 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The 2002 NAICS codes contain a number of new additions and changes from the previous 1997 NAICS codes that were used to classify business establishments in datasets covering the period 1998\u00ad2002. Therefore, this listing of high-technology industry codes can be applied only to datasets covering the years after 2002 when the 2002 NAICS codes were used to classify business establishments.\n\nThe BLS methodology includes the \"Federal Government, excluding Postal Service\" in its listing of high-technology industries. However, in this chapter \"high-technology industries\" is used in indicators that refer to business establishments and employment in those business establishments. These indicators are intended to measure private-sector activity. For this reason, \"Federal Government, excluding Postal Service\" was deleted from the list of high-technology industries. With this deletion, the list of high-technology industries used in this chapter includes the 46 four-digit codes from the 2002 NAICS listing shown in table 8-48.\nReference\nHecker D. 2005.

The purpose of this appendix is to explain the methodological and statistical criteria used to assess possible data sources for inclusion in SEI and to develop statements about the data. It also provides some basic information about how statistical procedures and reasoning are applied.\nThe first section describes the statistical considerations that are part of the selection process for data sets to be included in SEI. The next section discusses the different types of data (e.g., sample surveys, censuses, and administrative records) used in the report and provides some information about each type. A section on data accuracy follows, discussing factors that can affect accuracy at all stages of the survey process. The last section discusses the statistical testing employed to determine whether differences between sample survey-based estimates are statistically significant, i.e., greater than could be expected by chance. The appendix concludes with a glossary of statistical terms commonly used or referred to in the text. Selected key terms appear in bold in the text.\nSelection of Data Sources\nFour criteria guide the selection of data for SEI:\n Representativeness. Data should represent national or international populations of interest.\n Relevance. Data sources should include indicators central to the functioning of the science and technology enterprise.\n Timeliness. Data that are not part of a time series should be timely, i.e., substantial and unmeasured changes in the population under study should not have occurred since the data were collected.\n Statistical and methodological quality. Survey methods used to acquire data should provide sufficient assurance that statements based on statistical analysis of the data are valid and reliable.\nData that are collected by U.S. government agencies and that are products of the federal statistical system meet rigorous statistical and methodological criteria as described below. Unless otherwise indicated, these data are represen-\n\ntative of the nation as a whole and of the demographic, organizational, or geographic subgroups that comprise it.\nFor data collected by governments in other countries and nongovernment sources, including private survey firms and academic researchers, methodological information is examined to assess conformity with the criteria U.S. federal agencies typically use. Government statistical agencies in the developed world cooperate extensively in developing data quality standards and improving international comparability for key data, and methodological information about the data generated by this international statistical system is relatively complete.\nMethodological information about data from nongovernmental sources and from governmental agencies outside the international statistical system is often less well documented. These data are evaluated and must meet basic scientific standards for representative sampling of survey respondents and adequate and unbiased coverage of the population under study, and the resulting measurements must be sufficiently relevant and meaningful to warrant publication despite methodological uncertainties that remain after the documentation has been scrutinized. The most important statistical criteria are described in general terms below and in greater detail in the following sections.\nMany data sources that contain pertinent information about some segment of the S&E enterprise are not cited in SEI because their coverage of the United States as a nation is partial in terms of geography, incomplete in terms of segments of the population, or otherwise not representative. For example, data may be available only for a limited number of states or studies may be based on populations not representative of the United States as a whole. Similarly, data for other countries should cover and be representative of the entire country. (In some cases, data that have limited coverage or are otherwise insufficiently representative are referenced in sidebars.)\nData included in SEI must be of high quality. Data quality can be measured in a variety of ways, some of which are described in the following sections. Some key dimensions of quality include:\n Validity. Data have validity to the degree that they accurately measure the phenomenon they are supposed to represent.\n A-1\n\n\fA-2 \n\nAppendix. Methodology and Statistics\n\n Reliability. Data have reliability to the degree that the same results would be produced if the same measurement or procedure were performed multiple times on the same population.\n Lack of bias. Data are unbiased to the degree that estimates from the data do not deviate from the population value of a phenomenon in a systematic fashion.\nData Sources\nMuch of the data cited in SEI come from surveys. Surveys strive to measure characteristics of target populations. To generalize survey results correctly to the population of interest, a survey's target population must be rigorously defined and the criteria determining membership in the population must be applied consistently in determining which units to include in the survey.\nSome surveys are censuses (also known as universe surveys), in which the survey attempts to obtain data for all population units. The decennial census, in which the target population is all U.S. residents, is the most familiar census survey. SEI uses data from the Survey of Earned Doctorates, an annual census of individuals who earn doctorates from accredited U.S. institutions, for information about the numbers and characteristics of new U.S. doctorate holders.\nOther surveys are sample surveys, in which data are obtained for only a representative portion of the population units. The Survey of Recent College Graduates, which gathers data on individuals who recently received bachelor's or master's degrees in science, engineering, and health fields from U.S. institutions, is an example of a sample survey.\nA sample is a probability sample if each unit in the sampling frame has a known, nonzero probability of being selected for the sample. Probability samples are necessary for inferences about a population to be evaluated statistically. Except for some Asian surveys referenced in chapter 7, sample surveys included in SEI use probability sampling. In nonprobability sampling, a sample is selected haphazardly, purposively, or conveniently, and inferences about the population cannot be evaluated statistically. Internet surveys and phone-in polls that elicit responses from self-selected individuals are examples of nonprobability sample surveys.\nIn sample surveys, once a survey's target population has been defined, the next step is to establish a list of all members of that target population (i.e., a sampling frame). Members of the population must be selected from this list in a scientific manner so that it will be possible to generalize from the sample to the population as a whole. Surveys frequently sample from lists that to varying extents omit members of the target population, because complete lists are typically unavailable.\nSurveys may be conducted of individuals or of organizations, such as businesses, universities, or government agencies. Surveys of organizations are often referred to as establishment surveys. An example of an establishment sur-\n\nvey used in SEI is the Survey of Research and Development Expenditures at Universities and Colleges.\nSurveys may be longitudinal or cross-sectional. In a longitudinal survey, the same individuals (or organizations) are surveyed repeatedly. The primary purpose of longitudinal surveys is to investigate how individuals or organizations change over time. The Survey of Doctorate Recipients is a longitudinal sample survey of individuals who received research doctorates from U.S. institutions. SEI uses results from this survey to analyze the careers of doctorate holders.\nCross-sectional surveys provide a \"snapshot\" at a given point of time. When conducted periodically, cross-sectional surveys produce repeated snapshots of a population, enabling analysis of how the population changes over time. However, because the same individuals or organizations are not included in each survey cycle, cross-sectional surveys cannot, in general, track changes for specific individuals or organizations. National and international assessments of student achievement in K\u00ad12 education, such as those discussed in chapter 1, are examples of repeated cross-sectional surveys. Most of the surveys cited in SEI are conducted periodically, although the frequency with which they are conducted varies.\nSome of the data in SEI come from administrative records (data previously collected for the purpose of administering various programs). Examples of data drawn directly from administrative records in SEI include patent data from the records of government patent offices; bibliometric data on publications in S&E journals, compiled from information collected and published by the journals themselves; and data on foreign S&E workers temporarily in the United States, drawn from the administrative records of immigration agencies.\nMany of the establishment surveys that SEI uses depend heavily, although indirectly, on administrative records. Universities and corporations that respond to surveys about their R&D activities often use administrative records developed for internal management or income tax reporting purposes to respond to these surveys.\nSurveys are conducted using a variety of modes (e.g., mail, telephone, the Internet, or in person). They can be selfor interviewer administered. Many surveys are conducted in more than one mode. For example, the Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering, a census of establishments (university departments) from which students earn S&E graduate degrees, collects most of its data via a Web-based questionnaire but also allows respondents to answer a paper questionnaire. The National Survey of College Graduates, a longitudinal sample survey that collects data on individuals with S&E-related degrees and/or occupations, is initially conducted by sending a paper questionnaire by mail. Later, potential participants who did not respond to the questionnaire are contacted via telephone or in person.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n A-3\n\nData Accuracy\nAccurate information is a primary goal of censuses and sample surveys. Accuracy can be defined as the extent to which results deviate from the true values of the characteristics in the target population. Statisticians use the term \"error\" to refer to this deviation. Good survey design seeks to minimize survey error.\nStatisticians usually classify the factors affecting the accuracy of survey data into two categories: nonsampling and sampling errors. Nonsampling error applies to all surveys, including censuses, whereas sampling error applies only to sample surveys. The sources of nonsampling error in surveys have analogues for administrative records: the processes through which such records are created affect the degree to which the records accurately indicate the characteristics of relevant populations (e.g., patents, journal articles, immigrant scientists and engineers).\nNonsampling Error\nNonsampling error refers to error related to survey design, data collection, and processing procedures. Each stage of the survey process is a potential source of nonsampling error. For most types, there is no practical method of measuring the extent of nonsampling error. A brief description of five sources of nonsampling error follows. Although for convenience the descriptions occasionally refer to samples, they apply equally to censuses.\nSpecification Error. Survey questions often do not perfectly measure the concept for which they are intended as indicators. For example, the number of patents is not the same as the amount of invention.\nFrame Error. The sampling frame, the list of the target population members used for selecting survey respondents, is often inaccurate. If the frame has omissions or other flaws, the survey is less representative because coverage of the target population is incomplete. Frame errors often require extensive effort to correct.\nNonresponse Error. Nonresponse errors occur because not all members of the sample respond to the survey. Response rates indicate what proportion of sample members respond to the survey. Other things being equal, lower response rates create a greater possibility that, had nonrespondents supplied answers to the questionnaire, the survey estimates would have been different.\nNonresponse can cause nonresponse bias, which occurs when the people or establishments that respond to a question, or to the survey as a whole, differ in systematic ways from those who do not respond. For example, in surveys of national populations, complete or partial nonresponse is often more likely among lower-income or less-educated respondents. Evidence of nonresponse bias is an important factor in decisions about whether survey data should be included in SEI.\n\nManagers of high-quality surveys, such as those in the U.S. federal statistical system, do research on nonresponse patterns to assess whether and how nonresponse might bias survey estimates. SEI notes instances where reported data may be subject to substantial nonresponse bias.\nThe response rate does not indicate whether a survey has a problem of nonresponse bias. Surveys with high response rates sometimes have substantial nonresponse bias, and surveys with relatively low response rates, if nonrespondents do not differ from respondents on important variables, may have relatively little.\nMeasurement Error. There are many sources of measurement error, but respondents, interviewers, and survey questionnaires are the most important. Knowingly or unintentionally, respondents may provide incorrect information. Interviewers may inappropriately influence respondents' answers or record their answers incorrectly. The questionnaire can be a source of error if there are ambiguous, poorly worded, or confusing questions, instructions, or terms, or if the questionnaire layout is confusing.\nIn addition, the records or systems of information that a respondent may refer to, the mode of data collection, and the setting for the survey administration may contribute to measurement error. Perceptions about whether data will be treated as confidential may affect the accuracy of survey responses to sensitive questions about business profits or personal incomes.\nProcessing Error. Processing errors include errors in recording, checking, coding, and preparing survey data to make them ready for analysis.\nSampling Error\nSampling error is probably the best-known source of survey error and the most commonly reported measure of a survey's precision or accuracy. Unlike nonsampling error, sampling error can be quantitatively estimated in most scientific sample surveys.\nChance is involved in selecting the members of a sample. If the same, random procedures were used repeatedly to select samples from the population, numerous samples would be selected, each containing different members of the population with different characteristics. Each sample would produce different population estimates. When there is great variation among the samples drawn from a given population, the sampling error is high and there is a large chance that the survey estimate is far from the true population value. In a census, because the entire population is surveyed, there is no sampling error.\nSampling error is reduced when samples are large, and most of the surveys used in SEI have large samples. Sampling error is not a function of the percentage of the population in the sample (when the population is large) or the population size but is a function of the sample size, the variability of the measure of interest, and the methods used to produce estimates from the sample data.\n\n\fA-4 \n\nAppendix. Methodology and Statistics\n\nSampling error is measured by the standard error of the estimate, sometimes called the \"margin of error.\" The standard error of an estimate measures how closely the estimate from a particular sample approximates the average result of all possible samples. The standard error of the estimate is expressed as a range in the size of the difference (e.g., \u00b12%) between the sample estimate and the average result of all possible samples.\nStatistical Testing for Data From Sample Surveys\nStatistical tests determine whether differences observed in sample survey data could have happened by chance, i.e., as the result of random variation in which people or establishments in the population were sampled. Differences that are very unlikely to have been produced by chance variations in sample selection are termed statistically significant. When SEI reports statements about differences on the basis of sample surveys, the differences are statistically significant at the .05 level. This means that, if there were no true difference in the population, the chance of drawing a sample with the observed difference would be no more than 5%.\nA statistically significant difference is not necessarily large, important, or significant in the usual sense of the word. It is simply a difference that cannot be attributed to chance variation in sampling. With the large samples common in SEI data, extremely small differences can be found to be statistically significant. Conversely, quite large differences may not be statistically significant if the sample or population sizes of the groups being compared are small. Occasionally, apparently large differences are noted in the text as not being statistically significant to alert the reader that these differences may have occurred by chance.\nNumerous differences are apparent in every table in SEI that reports sample data. The tables permit comparisons between different groups in the survey population and in the same population in different years. It would be impractical to test and indicate the statistical significance of all possible comparisons in tables involving sample data.\nAs explained in \"About Science and Engineering Indicators\" at the beginning of this volume, SEI presents indicators. It does not model the dynamics of the S&E enterprise, although analysts could construct models using the data in SEI. Accordingly, SEI does not make use of statistical procedures suitable for causal modeling and does not compute effect sizes for models that might be constructed using these data.\n\nGlossary\nMost glossary definitions are drawn from U.S. Office of Management and Budget, Office of Statistical Policy (2006), \"Standards and Guidelines for Statistical Surveys\" and U.S. Bureau of the Census (2006), \"Organization of Metadata, Census Bureau Standard Definitions for Surveys and Census Metadata.\" In some cases, glossary definitions are somewhat more technical and precise than those in the text, where fine distinctions are omitted to improve readability.\nAdministrative records: Data collected for the purpose of carrying out various programs (e.g., tax collection).\nBias: Systematic deviation of the survey estimated value from the true population value. Refers to systematic errors that can occur with any sample under a specific design.\nCoverage: Extent to which all elements on a frame list are members of the population and to which every element in a population appears on the frame list once and only once.\nCoverage error: Discrepancy between statistics calculated on the frame population and the same statistics calculated on the target population. Undercoverage errors occur when target population units are missed during frame construction, and overcoverage errors occur when units are duplicated or enumerated in error.\nCross-sectional sample survey: Based on a representative sample of respondents drawn from a population at a particular point in time.\nEstimate: A numerical value for a population parameter derived from information collected from a survey and/ or other sources.\nEstimation error: Difference between a survey estimate and the true value of the parameter in the target population.\nFrame: A mapping of the universe elements (i.e., sampling units) onto a finite list (e.g., the population of schools on the day of the survey).\nItem nonresponse: Occurs when a respondent fails to respond to one or more relevant item(s) on a survey.\nLongitudinal sample survey: Follows the experiences and outcomes over time of a representative sample of respondents (i.e., a cohort).\nMeasurement error: Difference between observed values of a variable recorded under similar conditions and some fixed true value (e.g., errors in reporting, reading, calculating, or recording a numerical value).\nNonresponse bias: Occurs when the observed value deviates from the population parameter due to differences between respondents and nonrespondents. Nonresponse bias may occur as a result of not obtaining 100% response from the selected units.\nNonresponse error: Overall error observed in estimates caused by differences between respondents and nonrespondents. Consists of a variance component and nonresponse bias.\n\n\fScience and Engineering Indicators 2008\n\n A-5\n\nNonsampling error: Includes measurement errors due to interviewers, respondents, instruments, and mode; nonresponse error; coverage error; and processing error.\nPopulation: See \"target population.\" Precision of survey results: How closely results from a\nsample can reproduce the results that would be obtained from a complete count (i.e., census) conducted using the same techniques. The difference between a sample result and the result from a complete census taken under the same conditions is an indication of the precision of the sample result. Probabilistic methods: Any of a variety of methods for survey sampling that give a known, nonzero probability of selection to each member of a target population. The advantage of probabilistic sampling methods is that sampling error can be calculated. Such methods include random sampling, systematic sampling, and stratified sampling. They do not include convenience sampling, judgment sampling, quota sampling, and snowball sampling. Reliability: Degree to which a measurement technique would yield the same result each time it is applied. A measurement can be both reliable and inaccurate. Response bias: Deviation of the survey estimate from the true population value due to measurement error from the data collection. Potential sources of response bias include the respondent, the instrument, and the interviewer.\n\nResponse rates: Measure the proportion of the sample frame represented by the responding units in each study.\nSample design: Sampling plan and estimation procedures. Sampling error: Error that occurs because all members of\nthe frame population are not measured. It is associated with the variation in samples drawn from the same frame population. The sampling error equals the square root of the variance. Standard error: Standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a statistic. Although the standard error is used to estimate sampling error, it includes some nonsampling error. Statistical significance: Attained when a statistical procedure applied to a set of observations yields a p value that exceeds the level of probability at which it is agreed that the null hypothesis will be rejected. Target population: Any group of potential sample units or individuals, businesses, or other entities of interest. Unit nonresponse: Occurs when a respondent fails to respond to all required response items (i.e., fails to fill out or return a data collection instrument). Universe survey: Involves the collection of data covering all known units in a population (i.e., a census). Validity: Degree to which an estimate is likely to be true and free of bias (systematic errors).\n\n\f\fList of Appendix Tables\nin Volume 2\nTables can also be found on the enclosed CD-ROM\nChapter 1.
