Using data from the 2004/09 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:04/09), this study tracks a cohort of 2003\u221204 beginning postsecondary students over 6 years, presentng the most recent natonal statstcs on STEM atriton among a group of students who consistently demonstrated high-level academic performance in college. Capitalizing on the postsecondary transcript data collected through BPS:04/09, this study also provides an analysis of STEM coursetaking, exploring how partcipaton and performance in undergraduate STEM coursework are associated with STEM atriton among top students in U.S. postsecondary insttutons. Because a majority of STEM careers require at least a bachelor's degree (Carnevale, Smith & Melton, 2011) , this study focuses on students who start their postsecondary educaton in a bachelor's degree program. Throughout this study, the term STEM atriton refers to enrollment choices that result in potental STEM graduates (i.e., those who declare a STEM major) leaving STEM felds. The purpose of this study is to deepen understanding of STEM atriton in U.S. postsecondary educaton by addressing the following questons:\n\u2022 To what extent do high-performing college students enter and subsequently leave STEM felds?\n\u2022 Who leaves STEM felds? Into which felds do they move?\n\u2022 Do STEM persisters and leavers difer in STEM coursetaking and performance?\n\u2022 What predicts STEM atriton among high-performing college students? Which factors are among the most important ones?\nIn the context of this study, high-performing college students are operatonalized in terms of their academic performance during their undergraduate careers (note that data on high school academic performance are limited in BPS:04/09; high school grades, though available in BPS:04/09, were not collected for students age 24 or above). High-performing students are defned as those who demonstrate consistent, high-level performance during their 6-year college enrollment. This variable was derived from students' yearly grade point average (GPA) between 2003 and 2009 as recorded on their transcripts. For example, students with 6 years of GPA records are considered high performers if their GPAs were 3.5 or higher for at least 5 out of 6 years and none of their yearly GPAs were below 2.5. For the purpose of comparison, this study also includes two additonal groups -low-and moderate-performing students. Students with 6 years of GPA records are considered low performers if their GPAs were below 2.5 for at least 5 out of 6 years and none of their yearly GPAs were 3.5 or above. The remaining students with 6 years of GPA records are considered moderate performers. The same logic applies to students with 5 or fewer years of GPA records.\nTo provide a context for the analyses and facilitate discussions, the following sectons present a brief review of research literature, defne several key terms used in this study, and describe the data sources, sample, and methodology used for the analyses."}, {"section_title": "Literature review", "text": "Although one-third of students express interest in STEM majors before startng college (Natonal Science Board, 2012) , the actual STEM enrollment rate is not that high. For example, STEM majors accounted for just 14 percent of all undergraduates enrolled in U.S. postsecondary educaton in 2007-08 (Snyder & Dillow, 2013) . For various reasons, a signifcant porton of students who initally intend to study STEM felds abandon them several years later. A report published by the U.S. Department of Educaton found that 56 percent of beginning postsecondary students who declared STEM majors in their freshman year lef these felds over the next 6 years (Chen, 2009) . Several studies also found that many STEM leavers were top students who might have made valuable additons to the STEM workforce had they persisted and earned degrees in STEM felds (Betnger, Vol. 5 (1), 2015, pp 42 2010; Lowell, Salzman, Bernstein & Henderson, 2009; Seymour & Hewit, 1997) . The extent and causes of STEM departure among top students, however, have not been extensively examined.\nStudies frequently fnd that women, non-Asian minorites, frst-generaton students (i.e. those who are the frst members of their families to atend college), and those from low-income backgrounds leave STEM felds at higher rates than do their counterparts (Anderson & Kim, 2006; Grifth, 2010; Hill, Corbet & Rose, 2010; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010; Shaw & Barbut, 2010) . In additon, STEM atriton occurs more frequently among students with weaker academic backgrounds (LeBeau, Harwell, Monson, Dupuis, Medhanie & Post, 2012; M\u00e9ndez, Buskirk, Lohr & Haag, 2008; Whalen & Shelley, 2010) . There is also evidence linking STEM atriton to such attudinal factors as motvaton, confdence, and beliefs about one's capacity to learn STEM subjects: students who are less motvated to study STEM, lack confdence in their abilites to complete STEM programs, and have low self-efcacy towards STEM learning tend to leave STEM felds at higher rates than do their counterparts (Burtner, 2005; Wang, Eccles & Kenny, 2013) .\nAnecdotal evidence and small-scale studies have identfed several course-related factors that may explain why students lose their interest in STEM programs, including negatve experiences encountered in gatekeeper or introductory math and science courses; limited exposure to STEM coursework in the frst 2 years in college; and poor performance in STEM courses, especially relatve to performance in non-STEM courses (Betnger, 2010; Barr, Gonzalez & Wanat, 2008; Mervis, 2010; Ost, 2010; Rask, 2010; Seymour, 2001; Seymour & Hewit, 1997; Stnebrickner & Stnebrickner, 2011) . These fndings, however, have not been validated using natonally representatve data.\nStudents' experiences or perceptons of insttuton and workplace context/climate may also contribute to STEM atriton. Such factors include inadequate academic advising, career counseling, and insttuton support; feelings of isolaton in STEM felds because too few peers pursue STEM degrees and too few role models and mentors are available (mainly pertnent to women and underrepresented minorites); distaste for the compettve climate in STEM departments (women especially); perceived discriminaton on the basis of sex and/or race/ethnicity in the STEM workforce; and atracton of lucratve careers such as health care and business (Betnger, 2010; Carrell, Page & West, 2010; Chang, Eagan, Lin & Hurtado, 2011; Daempfe, 2003; Eagan, Herrera, Garibay, Hurtado & Chang, 2011; Espinosa, 2011; Fouad et al., 2010; Gayles & Ampaw, 2014; Price, 2010; Shaw & Barbut, 2010) . These contextual and climate factors are now considered as areas worthy of investgaton for explaining the departure of students (especially women and minorites) from STEM felds, although these data are rarely collected by natonal surveys.\nThe review of past research suggests that students' decisions to leave STEM felds are likely to arise from a multtude of factors, underscoring the need to examine models of STEM atriton that include multple factors simultaneously. In light of this review, the analyses in this study encompass as many related factors as available in BPS:04/09. Past research has already provided extensive insights into demographic and prior college characteristcs; therefore, this study pays special atenton to STEM coursetaking and performance and their role in STEM atriton.\nTo facilitate discussions of the analyses and results, Table 1 provides the defnitons of key terms used in this study. To provide a longitudinal look at STEM atriton over 6 years in college, this study focuses on a subsample of BPS:04/09 students who partcipated in the inital survey in 2003\u221204 as well as in the two follow-up surveys in 2006 and 2009. Because many variables in this study are transcript based, the sample is narrowed to students who had transcript data available for analyses. Since most STEM occupatons require a bachelor's degree, the sample is further restricted to students who began their postsecondary educaton in a bachelor's degree program. Afer these selectons, the fnal study sample consists of about 7,400 beginning bachelor's degree students. The study begins with descriptve analyses that present natonal statstcs on STEM entrance and atriton rates among high-performing students; compare students' atriton rates in STEM and non-STEM felds; examine the characteristcs of those who lef STEM felds and the felds into which they moved; and identfy diferences between STEM leavers and persisters in their STEM coursetaking and performance in college."}, {"section_title": "STEM felds", "text": "Built on the bivariate results, the study then uses multvariate regression to explore the associaton of various factors with STEM atriton, while taking into account the interrelatonship of these factors. The purpose of this multvariate analysis is twofold: to determine whether afer controlling for various factors, high-performing students difer from other students in terms of their way of exitng STEM felds; and to identfy the factors associated with high-performing students' departure from STEM felds.\nBecause students who enter STEM felds can have multple STEM outcomes (e.g., they can persist in a STEM feld; they can switch majors and pursue a non-STEM feld; or they can quit school entrely without earning a degree or certfcate), multnomial probit (MNP) regression is chosen for the multvariate analysis in this study. MNP is one of the most common statstcal techniques used to predict the probability of a respondent choosing a certain outcome out of several mutually exclusive alternatves (Borooah, 2001 ).\nVol. 5(1), 2015, pp 45\nAssuming that each individual faces a set of outcomes, an MNP model formulaton may be writen as follows:\nwhere i (= 1, 2, \u2026, N) represents an individual; j (= 1, 2, \u2026, M) represents one of M diferent outcomes of the dependent variable yi; x' i is a vector of independent variables that may be associated with or infuence an individual's outcome or choice; and the error term, e i 's, is assumed to follow a multvariate normal distributon. MNP assumes that each individual chooses the opton yielding the highest utlity of all alternatves. That is, an individual i chooses the outcome j if the outcome y* ij is the highest for j:\nThe probability of an individual i choosing outcome j is conditonal on or a functon of the set of independent variables, x' i s:\nwhere for a probit analysis, F represents a cumulatve probability functon based on the normal distributon. Only M\u22121 of the probabilites can be freely specifed because the probability for all alternatves sum to one (i.e., p(\nMore details on MNP model specifcatons used in the study are provided in the discussion of multvariate results below. Figure 1 shows STEM entrance rates based on students' reported major felds. About 28 percent of 2003\u221204 beginning bachelor's degree students entered a STEM feld at some point during their enrollment between 2003 and 2009. The STEM entrance rate for high-performing students was 26 percent, which was not signifcantly diferent from the STEM entrance rates for low-and moderate-performing students (24 percent and 29 percent, respectvely)."}, {"section_title": "STEM ENTRANCE, DEPARTURE, COURSETAKING, AND PERFORMANCE", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Figure 1. Percentage of students who entered STEM and selected non-STEM felds: 2003-2009", "text": "Figure 1 also shows that among various felds, STEM was one of the most popular felds for undergraduates: 28 percent of beginning bachelor's degree students chose a STEM major at some point, while 13-14 percent chose a humanity, educaton, or heath science major. STEM also atracted proportonally more high-performing students than did many non-STEM felds: 26 percent of high-performing students entered STEM felds, while 12-22 percent of high-performing students entered social/behavioral science, humanity, business, educaton, or health science felds.\nMany STEM entrants leave STEM felds several years later (Chen, 2009) . The STEM atriton rate among high-performing students was relatvely lower, however: 36 percent of highperforming students who entered STEM felds between 2003 and 2009 had lef these felds by spring 2009. In comparison, the STEM atriton rate among low-performing students was much higher, at 71 percent. In additon, low-and high-performing students appeared to exit STEM felds in diferent ways. While lowperforming students were more likely than high-performing students to leave STEM felds via dropping out of college (57 percent vs. 10 percent), high-performing students were more likely than low-performing students to leave STEM felds via switching majors (26 percent vs. 14 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Figure 2.

For example, business was the most frequent destnaton for low-performing students: about a quarter of low-performing students who entered STEM felds but changed majors later ended up in business. For high-performing students, the feld of health sciences was a popular destnaton: a total of 24 percent of high-performing students who entered STEM felds but changed majors later ended up in a health science feld. Overall, educaton was the least chosen feld for switching majors among all performance groups: the percentage of STEM entrants who switched to an educaton major was 7 percent for low-performing students, 5 percent for moderate-performing students, and 9 percent for high-performing students. Table 3 shows the characteristc of STEM entrants who lef STEM felds. Although the table presents data for all performance groups, the discussion below focuses on high-performing students. Overall, few high-performing students lef STEM felds by dropping out of college (10 percent, see Figure 2 ); but among those who did leave STEM this way, they were more likely to be male students (13 percent); frst-generaton students (22 percent); students who did not take math courses beyond Algebra II/trigonometry in high school (11 percent); students who frst atended the least selectve 4-year insttutons (26 percent); and students who frst atended private for-proft 4-year insttutons (74 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Figure 4. Atriton rates in STEM and selected non-STEM felds among high-performing students", "text": "Vol. High-performing students who lef STEM felds via switching majors had somewhat diferent characteristcs: they tended to be female (31 percent) or students who were from high-income backgrounds (31 percent), earned a high school GPA of below 3.0 (37 percent), did not take math courses beyond algebra II/trigonometry in high school (36 percent), or frst atended moderately or highly selectve 4-year insttutons (27 percent). These paterns suggest that STEM leavers via dropping out of college may be diferent from STEM leavers via switching majors in terms of their intenton, motvaton, and reasons for their exit from STEM felds.\nThe substantal outlow from STEM felds by the end of the frst year has been well documented, underscoring the importance of examining frst-year data (Chang, Cerna, Han & S\u00e1enz, 2008; Seymour & Hewit, 1997 The bivariate analyses above did not take into account potentally complex relatonships among multple, ofen related, factors.

More specifcally, the MNP model in this study focuses on the two STEM atriton outcomes (i.e., switching majors and leaving college without a credental), using \"persistng in STEM felds\" as the base category.\nTwo MNP regressions are run. The frst one determines whether high-performing students have a diferent probability of leaving STEM felds than other students afer controlling for various factors. Built on the results of the frst regression, the second regression restricts the sample to high-performing students, identfying the factors that are associated with STEM departure for this group. Thus, the frst model includes all STEM entrants, and the second model includes a subsample of STEM entrants who are high-performing students."}, {"section_title": "Independent variables", "text": "Many factors have been identfed in the literature as potentally important to STEM atriton. As indicated by the literature review above, these factors include (but are not limited to) demographic characteristcs, precollege academic preparaton, insttutonal context, climate and support, and coursetaking and performance. The MNP models below atempt to include as many of these factors as available in BPS:04/09 to examine their associatons with STEM outcomes while controlling for the interrelatonships among these factors.\nSpecifcally, for demographic characteristcs, the MNP models include sex, race/ethnicity, parental educaton, and income. For precollege academic preparaton, two high school variables are included in the MNP models: overall GPA and the highest level of math course taken. While high school GPA measures students' overall academic preparaton for college, the kind of math courses taken indicates the level of math preparaton students bring to college.\nAlthough insttutonal climate, support, and resources for STEM learning and faculty characteristcs have been identfed as potental factors associated with STEM atriton, none of these variables are available in BPS:04/09. Instead, this study uses the type and selectvity of the inital 4-year insttuton as proxies for insttuton contextual factors for STEM learning.\nFinally, the amount of STEM coursework in college (especially in the frst year), the type of STEM courses taken (partcularly in math), and how well students perform in STEM felds, especially relatve to the performance in non-STEM felds, are fgured prominently in students' decisions to leave STEM felds. These experiences are represented by the following variables: percentage of STEM credits in all credits earned in the frst year, the highest math course taken in the frst year, percentage of withdrawn/failed STEM courses in all STEM courses atempted through 2009, and STEM GPA relatve to non-STEM GPA in the frst year as well as through 2009."}, {"section_title": "Leaving STEM felds: Switching majors or dropping out of college?", "text": "Table 5 presents the MNP results for the two types of STEM atriton-changing majors and leaving collegecompared with the base category, \"persistng in STEM felds.\" This analysis mainly determines whether students with diferent performance levels leave STEM felds in diferent ways afer controlling for related factors. To provide an easier interpretaton of the regression results, two estmates are presented in the table: the average marginal efect (AME) and the average predicted probability (APP). The AME represents the average percentage point change in the predicted probability of leaving STEM felds associated with a one-unit change in an independent variable, holding all other independent variables constant in the model. A signifcant AME for an Vol. 5(1), 2015, pp 51 independent variable suggests that the observed change in the predicted probability is signifcantly diferent from zero, meaning the independent variable has a signifcant associaton with the outcome variable afer controlling for other independent variables in the model. APP represents the average predicted probability of leaving STEM felds for a partcular group of students (e.g., high-performing students) afer controlling for all other independent variables in the model.\nThe bivariate analysis above shows that low-performing students were more likely than high-performing students to leave STEM felds by dropping out of college, while high-performing students were more likely than their low-performing counterparts to leave STEM felds by switching majors. This fnding remains even afer controlling for many other factors in the multvariate analysis. The average predicted probability of leaving college without earning a degree or certfcate was 41 percent for low-performing STEM entrants, which was about 32 percentage points higher than that for their high-performing counterparts (9 percent). On the other hand, the average predicted probability of switching majors for high-performing students was 25 percentage points higher than that for low-performing students (36 percent vs. 11 percent). These results suggest that all other factors being equal, high-performing students were more prone to leave STEM felds by switching majors than low-performing students, who were more prone to leave STEM felds by dropping out of college.

The results, shown in Table 6 , reveal that for high-performing students, the amount of frst-year STEM coursetaking and performance in such coursework were among the most important factors associated with the outcome of switching majors.\nSpecifcally, the amount of STEM courses taken in the frst year fgured prominently in high-performing STEM entrants' likelihood of switching majors. For example, all other factors being controlled in the model, STEM entrants with lower STEM credit loads in the frst year (i.e., less than 25 percent of total credits earned in STEM felds) had a higher probability of switching majors than did their counterparts with higher frst-year STEM credit loads (i.e., 50 percent or more of total credits earned in STEM felds) (61 percent vs. 18 percent).\nVol. 5(1), 2015, pp 53\nThe level of withdrawn/failed STEM courses was another key factor in students' likelihood of switching majors: those who withdrew or failed at least 20 percent of their STEM courses (as opposed to less than 10 percent) had a higher probability of switching to non-STEM majors (54 percent vs. 26 percent). Furthermore, STEM entrants whose frst-year STEM grades were lower than their non-STEM grades by at least 1 grade point had a higher probability of switching majors than did those whose STEM grades were equal to or higher than their non-STEM grades (68 percent vs. 24 percent).

Specifcally, compared with white STEM entrants, black STEM entrants had a higher probability of switching majors (77 percent vs. 24 percent).

"}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "Through analyzing survey and transcript data from BPS:04/09, this study contributes to some understanding of STEM atriton among high-performing students in U.S. postsecondary insttutons. Several conclusions can be drawn from this study. First, although STEM atriton appeared high in U.S. postsecondary educaton,, many non-STEM felds experienced similar or even higher atriton rates. Switching majors, for example, was more common in such felds as educaton, health sciences, and humanites than in STEM felds. Thus, high atriton rates were not unique to STEM felds.\nSecond, high STEM atriton primarily occurred among low-performing students. The majority of highperforming students who entered STEM felds persisted in these felds. Given that STEM was one of the top major choices among high-performing students, over concern about losing top students in STEM felds may not be warranted.\nVol. 5(1), 2015, pp 55\nThird, consistent with early research and proposed theories (Betnger, 2010; Ost, 2010; Rask, 2010; Seymour & Hewit, 1997) , the results of this study point to several potental reasons for high-performing students switching STEM majors, including:\n\u2022 Poor performance in STEM courses. The probability of switching majors for high-performing students was associated with poor STEM performance (as refected by lower STEM grades relatve to non-STEM grades and high volumes of withdrawn/failed STEM courses), suggestng that STEM coursework may have proved too challenging for some students, motvatng them to switch to less difcult felds in which they could earn higher grades and have a beter chance of success.\n\u2022 Weak focus on STEM coursework in the frst year. The probability of switching majors was higher among students who took signifcantly fewer STEM courses in the frst year. Some students may be less commited to STEM majors or may have other commitments that compete with their STEM coursework; but regardless of their situatons, the results of this study suggest that missing the opportunity to build early momentum in STEM coursework may lead students to abandon pursuing a STEM degree later on.\n\u2022 The lure of such felds as health sciences. A signifcant proporton of high-performing students switched to health science majors, indicatng that lucratve careers in health may draw top students into these felds as shown in early research (Betnger, 2010; Shaw & Barbut, 2010) ."}, {"section_title": "STUDY LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH", "text": "Three specifc limitatons of this research are worth notng. First, this study draws upon students' reported major felds to identfy STEM entrants. Because BPS:04/09 collected students' majors only at three points in tme and students could have had an unreported STEM major and STEM atriton could have occurred between the three data collecton points, the number of STEM entrants and the extent of STEM atriton may be underestmated.\nSecond, because BPS:04/09 is a general purpose survey on postsecondary educaton, its questons and survey elements are not tailored to include all variables relevant to STEM atriton. Some data identfed in the literature as potentally important to STEM atriton (e.g., insttutonal context, climate, and support for STEM learning; characteristcs of STEM faculty; STEM-related preparaton and experiences in high school; and noncognitve factors such as motvaton, interest, confdence in learning STEM subjects) are not available or limited in BPS:04/09. Consequently, the multvariate analysis in this study cannot control for all factors that have been shown in prior research to be related to STEM atriton.\nThird, past research suggests that there are some important distnctons among STEM felds. For example, the feld of biology/life sciences ofen atracts more female students than do \"hard\" sciences such as physics, engineering, and computer sciences (Natonal Science Board, 2012) . In additon, atriton rates and the factors that afect students' departure decisions may vary across STEM felds (Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010; Ost, 2010; Rask, 2010; Shaw & Barbut, 2010) . While it is ideal to diferentate specifc STEM felds, such an analysis is not feasible in this study due to the small number of high-performing students provided in BPS:04/09.\nGiven these limitatons, future STEM research should contnue to identfy additonal factors underlying students' choice of STEM majors and their long-term persistence in these felds. If sample sizes allow, a close examinaton of each STEM feld (such as life sciences, physical sciences, engineering, computer sciences, and mathematcs) will yield informaton that would help confrm whether factors infuencing STEM atriton are common among or vary across diferent STEM felds. Future research can also explore issues related to when students change majors, how many tmes they make such changes, and which major felds students frequently move into or out of. Such an investgaton would provide a beter understanding of the dynamic decisionmaking process of individuals who enter, persist in, or leave STEM felds. Finally, future research can expand the fndings of the current study by exploring students' transcript data more extensively, pinpointng which STEM courses, partcularly which gatekeeper courses in the frst 2 years, may hinder students' persistence in STEM felds."}]
