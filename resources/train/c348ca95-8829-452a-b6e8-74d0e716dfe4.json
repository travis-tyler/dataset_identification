[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: In US, approximately 23% of children between the ages of 2-5 years are overweight or obese. Parents need access to information to create healthy home environments for obesity prevention, yet participation for in-person education programs is challenging. Web-based interventions are promising educational tools due to 24/7 availability. However, information is limited on their development and evaluation.\nDesign and Methods: This study reports on a rigorous development process that included six focus group discussions (FGD) with stakeholders (three FGD each with parents and teachers) to assess education needs and inform the development of the Jump2Health Website \u2122 by a multidisciplinary team. After development, the Website was evaluated by telephone interviews with stakeholders (five parents and six teachers) and reviewed by an expert panel of five Registered Dietitians.\nResults: Twenty Head Start parents and 22 Head Start teachers participated in the FGD. To address the needs identified by these stakeholders, the Website was designed to include components that were enabling and motivating, such as descriptions of health benefits by achieving the desired behaviours, short videos on easy meal preparation, and tip sheets on how to achieve healthy behaviours in easy, economical ways. Stakeholder evaluation of the Website indicated that the information was helpful, easy to use, and would be beneficial for parents.\nConclusions: The development of Jump2Health Website \u2122 was strengthened by FGD with stakeholders that assessed educational needs. Interviews with stakeholders and an expert panel review showed that the Website may be an effective educational method to teach parents about healthy behaviours related to obesity prevention."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Approximately 23% of children between the ages of two to five in the United States are classified as overweight or obese, and almost 9% are obese. 1 Even though a recent report suggests that the prevalence in obesity in preschool children has been reduced in 19 states, 2 levels are still undesirably high and almost double the levels of 5% in the 1970's. 3 Overweight or obese pre-schoolers are five times as likely to become overweight or obese adults, compared with their normal weight peers. 2 In older children and adolescents, obesity is associated with high cholesterol, high blood sugar, asthma, and mental health problems. Studies suggest that the prevention of childhood obesity is related to multiple behaviours including: consuming more whole grain foods, consuming more fruits and vegetables, consuming less sweet drinks, and having more family meals, engaging in more physical activity, getting adequate amounts of sleep, and engaging in less screen time. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] These seven behaviours will be referred to as 7 Healthy Habits for this study.\nTo help parents develop a healthy home environment that will protect against child obesity, nutrition and health professionals need to provide parents with appropriate resources. 12 However, traditional in-person educational interventions with families are difficult due to work schedules, lack of time, and child care issues. 13, 14 These and other challenges may be especially prominent in parents with low-income . 15, 16 and may contribute to the finding that only 39% of low income parents responded that they were likely to sign up for a parenting program. 15 Through electronic health (e-Health) programs such as websites, parents could engage in online education programs from home while caring for children. Thus, in light of challenges related to traditional in-person education methods, web-based education is promising due to its 24/7 availability and its growth in accessibility. Americans' Internet access has increased from 52% in 2000 to 84% in 2015; access by households with an annual income under $30,000 a year is 74%. 17 Also, web-based education or e-Health may be as effective as traditional in-person education methods; however, this may depend on the behaviour (physical activity, dietary) and whether these behaviours are studied separately or together. 18 In a comparison of a web-based versus in-person nutrition education program for low-income adults, web-based participants made significant improvements (P<0.05) from pre to post in 15 of the 16 healthrelated behaviour outcomes (fruit and vegetable intake, breakfast eating, meal-planning frequency, physical activity, etc.). 19 The participants in the in-person education group improved significantly (P<0.05) from pre to post in 13 of the 16 health-related behaviour outcomes. These results showed that web-based education was similar in effectiveness to in-person education for dietary and physical activity outcomes. In addition to being accessible and"}, {"section_title": "Significance for public health", "text": "Overweight and obesity in preschool children are at undesirable levels, reflecting a need for parent education programs that address a comprehensive set of obesigenic behaviors (diet, family meals, physical activity, sleep, and screen time) and meet parental needs in terms of accessibility and appeal. Formative evaluation with stakeholders (parents, teachers, and nutrition experts) was useful in shaping the development of the Jump2Health Website\u2122. Websites may be able to overcome some of the challenges of traditional in-person education programs as parents can learn at their own pace and schedule. Parents may be able to obtain information from a website that they would have not felt comfortable asking their paediatrician. Stakeholders suggested that shorter text passages and additional topics on weight control and bullying be included. To provide more access and appeal, a mobile website for smartphones and other supportive materials (newsletters, text messages, and an interactive discussion blog) may be needed.\nArticle effective, web-based programs may be less expensive and more environmental friendly than in-person education programs. 20 Even though there is great potential for e-Health to reach large groups of people, more research is needed on acceptability, accessibility, and effectiveness of web-based and other e-Health programs, especially in underserved populations. 18 Further, while there are studies on obesity prevention in preschool children that include one or more desirable features (theory-based, stakeholder driven, and inclusion of multiple behaviours that are related to the health outcome), [21] [22] [23] only one study that includes all of these using e-Health has been reported, and it is in progress. 24 Given the need for innovative and accessible education programs to create healthier home environments for children in lowincome families, the goal of this research was to use stakeholder and expert input to develop and evaluate a theory-based educational website focused on 7 Healthy Habits for child obesity prevention. To achieve this goal, the PRECEDE-PROCEED planning model (PPM) was used to guide the engagement with the target community to determine education needs. 25 PPM has been used effectively to design interventions for a variety of populations and health issues for the past 30 years, with over 1000 publications reporting its use. 26 Specifically, PPM has been used to guide the qualitative assessment and development of healthy eating and childhood obesity prevention interventions in the CHANGE! Program 27 and the ToyBox-study. 21 PPM can be thought of as a road map and behaviour change theories as the specific directions to a destination. 28 "}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": "This study included two Phases conducted in 2012-2013. Phase I included a needs assessment and the development of the Jump2Health Website \u2122 . The needs assessment informed a multidisciplinary team of faculty and graduate students in the fields of nutrition, child development, computer science, and marketing in the initial prototype development of the Jump2Health Website \u2122 . Phase II evaluated the acceptability and feasibility of the Website. Both Phases I and II were approved by the Human Research Protection Program at Texas Tech University.\nPhase I: The Phase I Focus Group Discussions (FGD) were conducted with a self-selected sample of Head Start parents and teachers to identify low-income parents' needs related to promoting a healthy (non-obesogenic) home environment using the 7 Healthy Habits. All preschool teachers and parents who had children at 10 Head Start sites (29 teachers and 900 parents) in a local school district were invited to participate. Teachers were notified via email about the study from the Head Start Coordinator for the school district. Teachers then distributed recruitment fliers provided by the researchers to parents in their classrooms via their child's school folder that was routinely used for communication purposes between schools and parents. Parents and teachers then emailed the first author with their preferred date to attend one of the FGD. Three FGD were conducted with parents, and three FGD were conducted with teachers. The three FGD for parents had 5, 6, and 9 participants, respectively, for a total of 20 participants. The three FGD for teachers had 8, 5, and 9 participants, respectively, for a total of 22 participants. All FGD were held immediately at the end of the school day (teachers) or early evening (parents) at one of three elementary schools with a Head Start component. Child care was provided.\nThe content of the FGD questions (Table 1) included the 7 Healthy Habits and reflected the constructs of the PRECEDE component of the PRECEDE-PROCEED model (PPM). 25 Constructs and their definitions include: i) Predisposing (knowledge and attitudes that need to be in place for the desired behaviours to occur; ii) Enabling (resources and skills that need to be available to help facilitate the desired behaviours; and ii) Reinforcing (praise and encouragement from others and perceived benefits from performing the behaviour). Thus, an application of the PPM's predisposing and enabling constructs is shown in this study by Question 4: What information or resources would help you as a parent to help prevent or reduce these problems? To the extent that health education programs address a priority population's predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing needs, it can promote positive behaviour change.\nAll the responses were audio taped and transcribed after each FGD. NVivo qualitative analysis software (version 10.0, QSR International, qsrinternational.com) was used to analyse and code the responses from the FGD. Prior to coding, a preliminary codebook was developed related to the predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing constructs of the PPM. This allowed a deductive approach to guide initial coding similar to that employed by other researchers using qualitative research and the PPM to inform the development of health interventions. 27, 29 There were two coders, the first author and another doctoral student in nutritional sciences who was not affiliated with the research, but who had previously coded transcripts for other nutrition studies. They reviewed and coded the transcripts line by line in open coding that was modified by using the PPM constructs and the codebook as a general guide. Additional codes were added as part of the modified open coding process, if the content involved multiple constructs or did not fit within the three PPM constructs. All disagreements in coding were resolved through discussions with the two coders and the second author until consensus was reached. Emergent themes across FGD were explored by the first and second authors using an inductive process. Phase II: To obtain feedback on the Website after development (Phase II beta-testing), telephone interviews were conducted with a self-selected subsample of the parents and teachers who participated in the Phase I FGD and who indicated at that time that they would be interested in providing feedback about the Website, once it was developed. The five parents and six teachers who consented to participate were given a link to the Jump2Health Website\u2122 and asked to look at the 7 Healthy Habits sections for at least 20 minutes prior to participating in an individual interview set at their preferred day and time. Table 2 presents the questions asked to parents in Phase II; teachers were asked similar questions that were phrased to capture their views about the Website related to parents' needs and perspectives. Participants were emailed a copy of the questions in advance of the interviews to save time during the interview. Individual telephone interviews were conducted with the parent and teacher participants, using trained interviewers who were not members of the research team. The telephone interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed manually using word processing software.\nIn addition, feedback about the Website was obtained from an expert panel of five Registered Dietitians/Nutritionists (RDNs) recruited from the local Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics listserv (approximately 35 members). Panel members were not compensated for their participation. Their feedback was obtained by an online survey using Qualtrics (online survey tool for data collection and analysis, version 2013, Qualtrics, LLC, http://www.qualtrics.com). The links to the Website and to the Qualtrics evaluation survey were emailed to the expert panel.

Ideas for creative physical activity and help with sleep schedules were also mentioned frequently. Comments indicated that some parents already had been trying to make changes or were considering making changes in these behaviours. There was not a consensus on the best method for learning about the 7 Healthy Habits. Some parents and teachers mentioned traditional print materials, like newsletters that could be sent home, but disadvantages to that were identified.

Best practices for technology (user-friendliness with regard to consistent navigation and layout features (across each Healthy Habit) and health education (appeal through the use of color pictures and non-technical language) 32 were used. Across the 7 Healthy Habits, the reading level ranged from a grade level of approximately 6 th grade to 9 th grade, with an average of 8 th grade.

Features of the Website included tabs for each of the 7 Healthy Habits highlighting importance, recommendations, and tips and strategies. For content, the Website utilized national guidelines and reputable information related to nutrition, physical activity, health, and child development, from sources such as www.fns.usda,gov, www.fruitsandveggiesmorematters.org, and www.kidshealth.org.

Our findings are similar to other FGD with parents of preschoolers, suggesting common barriers related to healthy behaviours, including perceived lack of time and money, lack of knowledge about food preparation, and lack of strategies for picky eaters and concern for neighbourhood safety. [33] [34] [35] Although not specifically found in our FGD, parents of preschoolers in other studies mentioned that they had difficulty enforcing rules about some healthy behaviours because they had negative childhood memories, such as being denied foods, and not wanting to do that to their children, 35 or working parents feeling guilty about the limited time they had with their children in the evenings so they allowed their children to stay up later. 33 Teachers in our study saw the negative consequences of these parental behaviours in the types of foods their children brought to school and in children falling asleep in their desks. The need for information on parenting skills for healthy behaviours and the importance of parents being role models was a common finding in our FGD and in qualitative research with parents and other stakeholders. [33] [34] [35] Parents' perceived impressions related to healthy habits may be internal barriers. Internal barriers include a variety of thoughts and emotions that individuals identify as reasons why making behavioural health changes are difficult. 36 As they relate to this study, internal barriers may be perceived impressions that discourage certain healthy habits, regardless of whether the impressions match reality, such as cooking healthy meals takes too much time, or being physically active costs too much or is time consuming. Although some healthy foods are expensive, a parent's perceived impression that all healthy foods are too expensive may be an unnecessary internal barrier that keeps the parent from making dietary improvements. The perception that in order for children to be physically active, they should participate in extra-curricular sports is an unnecessary internal barrier, as parents can be informed about low-cost options, including those that parents and children can do together. Educators need to consider parents' perceptions and internal barriers when planning lifestyle change interventions. 24 Therefore, in our Website development, we included food preparation videos featuring low-cost, healthy, and easy-toprepare meals, and information on low cost versions of healthy foods, such as canned and frozen fruits and vegetables, to help reduce barriers to healthy food intake.

It was also found that most of the parents were very interested in the recipes and videos related to the 7 Healthy Habits, yet they had difficulty finding them in the different Healthy Habit sections. The interviews provided in depth qualitative responses that went beyond what could be learned from a quantitative survey. For example, the comment by one parent showed advantages of the Website in accessing information that they may not have felt comfortable asking health care providers and being able to digest the information at their own pace. Thus, online education has the potential to overcome barriers to health information that have been reported by other Head Start parents. 34 It is important to note that only two of the five parents mentioned that they felt motivated to start implementing the 7 Healthy Habits after viewing the Website. As mentioned in the results, this may reflect the responses of three parents who indicated that they already have been following these recommendations. However, it also shows the challenges of health education, even with a stakeholder-driven, theoretically-based intervention. Individual, social, and cultural barriers to Internet use may affect its effectiveness; these barriers should be further explored. 18 In addition to parent and teacher feedback, the expert panel validated the accuracy of the content and overall appeal and usefulness of the format of the Jump2Health Website \u2122 . The panel liked the cooking videos, recipes, and easy navigation. Interviews with nutrition education experts in Georgia also suggested the value of these in eLearning platforms for consumers with limited resources. 37 They suggested that motivation may be the most important barrier to eLearning in low-income audiences, not lack of access to the Internet or limited literacy. This is supported by two statements in our FGD's: But some parents just don't care (parent) and If parents follow it, it will be a useful resource to them (teacher).\nOverall, the Phase II beta-testing was very helpful to evaluate the Website and incorporate stakeholder feedback prior to additional development and testing on a larger scale. Some concern was mentioned by parents and teachers regarding Internet access by parents. Previous research in low-income adults found that approximately 50% of the respondents (n=1620) indicated that they had a working computer in their home, and of those, the majority (78%) had a high-speed Internet connection. 38 Chi-square analysis revealed that younger adults who were white and had more education were more likely to have a computer (P<0.001) and Internet. Thus, while web-based education may meet the needs of an increasing number of parents, access to the Internet may be a barrier for others. Also, it is important to consider that some parents and teachers in our study felt that parents would benefit from inperson group discussions and access to printed material, possibly as additional educational options."}, {"section_title": "Changes made as a result of Phase II", "text": "To address the feedback obtained in Phase II, the text throughout the Website was shortened where possible, and a read more button was added to all 7 Healthy Habit sections to allow the user to read additional information if interested in that topic. Separate buttons for the videos and recipes were added to the homepage, to provide easy access to the parents, in addition to being included within the 7 Healthy Habit sections. Two additional buttons were added to the Website to include information on childhood obesity and strategies for parents to encourage a positive self-image in their children to address concerns about bullying. Changes to the Jump2Health Website \u2122 to address motivation are on-going, including the development of a discussion blog for parents and a Pinterest-like section for parents to post successes related to the 7 Healthy Habits, and thus provide role models/encouragement to parents. Also, a mobile Jump2Health Website\u2122 for smart phones is being developed by the authors to provide more access to parents who may not have access to a personal computer."}, {"section_title": "Strengths and limitations", "text": "A strength of this study is its intervention focus on obesity prevention in the preschool child using e-Health. In recognition of the undesirable obesity levels in the preschool population and undesirable health behaviours starting at an early age, the preschool age is an important priority. Analysis of data from the national Early Childhood Longitudinal Study found that the incidence of obesity between the ages of 5 and 14 years was 4 times higher among children who had been overweight at 5 years of age compared to children who had a normal weight at the same age. 39 Another strength of this study was that the Jump2Health Website \u2122 content and features were developed by a multidisciplinary team using formative evaluation (input from parents and teachers) and beta testing (parents, teachers and expert panel). The use of all three stakeholder groups provided a more comprehensive evaluation than just relying on either parents, teachers, or expert panel only, during the development process. This allows comparisons to be made across the stakeholder groups to improve credibility and dependability, as was also found by Boddy and coauthors (2012) with their qualitative study that included parents, teachers, and elementary aged children. 27 Also, the content of the Jump2Health Website \u2122 , organized as 7 Healthy Habits, was based on current best practices and evidence analysis, including new factors related to childhood obesity, such as sleep. 7, 8 Other obesity prevention research involving parents of preschool children has included only one or a few healthy habits simultaneously, such as a program focusing on fruits, vegetables, and whole grains 40 and a program focusing on sugar-sweetened beverage and juice intake. 41 Of these, only the latter program was designed to be delivered by e-Health.\nThis study is subject to limitations inherent in qualitative research and is not generalizable to other contexts and settings. The study samples of parents and teachers were self-selected from Head Start classrooms in only one school district. Parents who participate in health programs may have a greater interest in learning about health for their children and different challenges and resources than non-participants. 42 Further, the 20 parent participants in Phase I included only 1 father so it is not known if other fathers in this Head Start program would have different knowledge or resource needs related to the PPM predisposing, enabling, or reinforcing factors. We don't know the reasons for non-participa-tion of parents in Phase II; perhaps the parents who didn't participate in Phase II lacked access to the Internet which reinforces the need to explore one size doesn't fit all."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Two phases of formative evaluation were used to guide the content and design of the Jump2Health Website \u2122 for parents of preschool children in Head Start. Our findings have complemented and extended the understanding of consumer-led research priorities to develop website education tools for obesity prevention in a high priority population of preschool children.\nThe Jump2Health Website \u2122 is promising as it shows that parents with low-income were able to access the Website and found it to be appealing and helpful. However, the Jump2Health Website \u2122 may not be feasible and effective with all preschool parents with low-income, but may serve as a valuable adjunct or option to traditional parent meetings and newsletters."}]
