Overall, these percentages were the same as those for 1989-1990. In 1995-1996, 25 percent of financially dependent students from families with incomes of $60,000 or more enrolled in private four-year institutions, a considerably higher percentage than the rate for students from families with incomes in the $30,000-$59,999 range (16 percent), or for those with incomes of less than $30,000 (14 percent).
