[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "for the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative IMPORTANCE Existing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or imaging (tau positron emission tomography) biomarkers for Alzheimer disease (AD) are invasive or expensive. Biomarkers based on standard blood test results would be useful in research, drug development, and clinical practice. Plasma neurofilament light (NFL) has recently been proposed as a blood-based biomarker for neurodegeneration in dementias.\nOBJECTIVE To test whether plasma NFL concentrations are increased in AD and associated with cognitive decline, other AD biomarkers, and imaging evidence of neurodegeneration.\nIn this prospective case-control study, an ultrasensitive assay was used to measure plasma NFL concentration in 193 cognitively healthy controls, 197 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 180 patients with AD dementia from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The study dates were September 7, 2005, to February 13, 2012. The plasma NFL analysis was performed in September 2016.\nAssociations were tested between plasma NFL and diagnosis, A\u03b2 pathologic features, CSF biomarkers of neuronal injury, cognition, brain structure, and metabolism.\nRESULTS Among 193 cognitively healthy controls, 197 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 180 patients with AD with dementia, plasma NFL correlated with CSF NFL (Spearman \u03c1 = 0.59, P < .001). Plasma NFL was increased in patients with MCI (mean, 42.8 ng/L) and patients with AD dementia (mean, 51.0 ng/L) compared with controls (mean, 34.7 ng/L) (P < .001) and had high diagnostic accuracy for patients with AD with dementia vs controls (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.87, which is comparable to established CSF biomarkers). Plasma NFL was particularly high in patients with MCI and patients with AD dementia with A\u03b2 pathologic features. High plasma NFL correlated with poor cognition and AD-related atrophy (at baseline and longitudinally) and with brain hypometabolism (longitudinally).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Plasma NFL is associated with AD diagnosis and with cognitive, biochemical, and imaging hallmarks of the disease. This finding implies a potential usefulness for plasma NFL as a noninvasive biomarker in AD."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "A lzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by brain accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) and tau, progressive atrophy, and cognitive decline. Biomarkers that capture biological processes in AD are increasingly used to support the diagnosis of AD in research, drug development, and clinical practice. 1 The most wellestablished AD biomarkers include structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of A\u03b2, tau, and neuronal injury; and positron emission tomographic imaging of A\u03b2, tau, and brain metabolism. [2] [3] [4] Use of these biomarkers is hampered by a high degree of invasiveness, high costs, or limited availability. 5 Blood-based biomarkers for AD may allow for efficient monitoring of disease processes in AD and could be used as a screening tool in primary care. One potential blood-based biomarker for AD is the neuronal injury marker neurofilament light (NFL) 6 because patients with AD have increased CSF concentrations of NFL. 7 Results from some studies 8, 9 suggest that patients with AD have increased plasma NFL concentrations. However, those studies were performed using standard immunoassay techniques with suboptimal analytical sensitivity to accurately quantify low abundant brain-specific proteins in blood samples. 10 For this reason, our group has recently transferred the CSF NFL assay to an ultrasensitive single-molecule array (Simoa; Quanterix Corporation) platform, which provides an analytical sensitivity of 0.6 pg/mL compared with 78.0 pg/mL for the corresponding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 10 Plasma NFL concentrations can be measured in all samples using the ultrasensitive single-molecule array and correlate closely with the corresponding CSF concentrations. 11, 12 Herein, we test this novel plasma NFL assay in patients with AD for the first time, to our knowledge. We studied cognitively healthy control individuals, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (MCI group), and patients with AD dementia (AD group) in a large prospective study.

The main findings were that plasma NFL (1) correlated with CSF NFL independent of diagnosis, (2) was increased in the AD dementia group and in A\u03b2-positive patients with MCI, (3) had diagnostic accuracy for AD dementia in the same range as established CSF biomarkers, and (4) was associated with cognitive deficits and neuroimaging hallmarks of AD at baseline and during follow-up. Together, these findings support that plasma NFL is a promising biomarker for neuronal injury in AD, which may have potential for prognosis and monitoring of disease progression. This biomarker may be useful in clinical studies, in drug development, and ultimately in clinical practice. However, increased plasma NFLxc concentrations are also found in several other neurodegenerative disorders, such as progressive supranuclear palsy, frontotemporal dementia, and human immunodeficiency virus with brain engagement, 11, 12, 15 meaning that it lacks disease specificity for AD. Therefore, we do not envision plasma NFL as a tool to differentiate AD from other neurodegenerative diseases. Rather, it may be valuable as a general biomarker for neurodegeneration. Plasma NFL correlated with CSF NFL levels in the whole cohort and in diagnostic groups. Although these correlations were statistically significant, particularly in the whole cohort, the correlation coefficients were slightly lower than what was seen in previous studies of plasma or serum NFL levels, which included individuals with human immunodeficiency virus, 11 progressive supranuclear palsy, 12 other neurological diseases, 10 and minor neurosurgical trauma. 21 Hypothetically, it is possible that a greater variability in plasma NFL concentrations in AD compared with previously tested diseases could have influenced the correlations between plasma NFL and CSF NFL. Plasma NFL also correlated with other CSF biomarkers in the whole cohort, but those correlations were often not statistically significant within diagnostic groups, suggesting that they were confounded by diagnosis. This finding probably reflects that several different pathologic conditions are present in AD (eg, A\u03b2 pathologic features, tau pathologic findings, and degeneration of different types of axons) and drive different biomarker responses, which will be weakly correlated overall. In MCI, a heterogeneous condition, high plasma NFL levles correlated with low CSF A\u03b242 and high CSF t-tau, "}, {"section_title": "Research Original Investigation", "text": "Plasma Neurofilament Light and Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer Disease and this correlation supports the use of plasma NFL as a biomarker sensitive to AD-related biological changes in prodromal AD. Plasma NFL also correlated with plasma tau in all diagnostic bagroups. Although plasma tau appears to be a weaker biomarker for neuronal injury than plasma NFL, 22 these measures may partly reflect the same process (eg, axonal degeneration). The AD dementia group had higher plasma NFL levels than the MCI group, and the MCI group and the AD dementia group had higher plasma NFL levels than the controls. Although plasma NFL overlaps between the diagnostic groups, the accuracy of plasma NFL for AD dementia vs controls is close to established CSF AD biomarkers and much higher than for plasma tau (AUROC, 0.87 vs 0.78 when adjusted for demographics and APOE \u03b54; AUROC, 0.79 vs 0.64 when adjusted only for demographics). To our knowledge, this study represents the first time that a peripheral, noninvasive biomarker for neuronal injury has shown diagnostic accuracy for AD dementia comparable with established biomarkers in a largescale multicenter cohort.\nIn the MCI group, plasma NFL levels were increased primarily in A\u03b2-positive patients with MCI (ie, prodromal AD). Plasma NFL concentration did not differ between clinically stable and progressive A\u03b2-positive patients with MCI. This result may have been influenced by the short follow-up time used to define stable MCI (2 years), which may be too abbreviated to verify the benign nature of the so-called stable condition. 23 The finding that plasma NFL concentrations were increased already in prodromal AD is promising because it may render plasma NFL more useful in drug development, which is largely focused on this early stage of AD, 1 as well as in clinical practice because patients with MCI increasingly seek medical evaluation. Plasma NFL did not differ between A\u03b2-positive and A\u03b2-negative controls, suggesting that any neuronal injury that may have occurred in A\u03b2-positive controls (ie, preclinical AD) is below the detection limit for plasma NFL. This result is well in line with the theory that preclinical AD is devoid of substantial neuronal injury. 24, 25 The final major finding was that plasma NFL was associated with several cognitive and imaging AD hallmarks at baseline and when those measures were analyzed over time. Specifically, plasma NFL was associated with general cognition (MMSE score and ADAS-COG 11 score) and executive function (TMT-B score) at baseline and with decline in all tested cognitive measures over time. The somewhat stronger correlations with timed tests, including TMT-B and WAIS-R digit symbol substitution test, compared with the memory test may suggest that plasma NFL primarily reflects damage to larger myelinated axonal processes of neurons. For imaging measures, associations were seen with lateral ventricles, hippocampal volume, and AD cortex thickness at baseline and over time, as well as with hypometabolism over time. The correlations were strongest in the MCI group and the AD dementia group but were statistically significant in the whole cohort when adjusting for diagnosis."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "This study is limited by the lack of patients with neurodegenerative diseases other than AD, which prevented our testing for disease specificity of plasma NFL. Another limitation is the restricted sample in the ADNI, such that patients with substantial vascular burden were excluded. This exclusion may have made it difficult to detect subtle associations between plasma NFL and white matter pathologic findings and may explain the surprising finding that plasma NFL did not correlate with WMHs, despite that CSF NFL has been considered a marker of white matter pathologic features, 26 including in AD. 7 Future studies should test plasma NFL in a more unselected group of patients with AD and may also explore different proxies for white matter injury. A larger age span should also be included in future work because it is possible that vascular comorbidities may change with age and alter the diagnostic accuracy of plasma NFL for patients with AD vs controls and other diseases.\nAll main results were in the expected directions, without illogical data. The main findings that plasma NFL concentration was increased in the AD dementia group and correlated with CSF NFL, imaging, and cognitive hallmarks of AD were all statistically significant. We believe that the consistency of these data makes it unlikely that they were falsely positive. Therefore, we reported P values uncorrected for multiple comparisons."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "We found that plasma NFL concentration is increased in AD, even in prodromal disease, and that it correlates with important disease hallmarks, measured by cognitive tests, neuroimaging, and CSF biomarkers. The fact that plasma NFL concentration is also elevated in other neurological diseases 11, 12, 15 and that NFL may be released from neurons in A\u03b2-dependent and A\u03b2-independent pathologic conditions 27 argues against the use of plasma NFL for differential diagnosis of AD vs other dementias. However, plasma NFL may be a valuable noninvasive tool to assess neurodegeneration and to identify individuals at risk for future cognitive decline and brain atrophy. Therefore, plasma NFL is a promising peripheral biomarker for neurodegeneration, including in AD. In a clinical trial scenario, it is possible that plasma NFL may be used (together with demographics and APOE \u03b54 genotype data) to predict longitudinal disease progression. Future studies with repeated samples should test plasma NFL as a longitudinal noninvasive proxy for neurodegeneration.
