One important factor is the issue of power and low signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio in neuroimaging studies of rare study populations including endocrine or neurological patient groups. The present study assessed whether the reliability of findings across structural anatomical measures including thickness, volume, and surface area could be increased by using two back-to-back within session structural MRI scans in 40 transgender men (TM), 40 transgender women (TW), 30 cisgender men (CM), and 30 cisgender women (CW). Overall, findings in transgender persons were more consistent with at-birth assigned sex in brain volume and surface area while no group differences emerged for cortical thickness. Repeated measures analysis also indicated that having a second scan increased SNR in all ROIs, most notably bilateral frontal poles, accumbens nuclei and putamina.\nFurthermore, additional significant group differences emerged in cortical surface area when age and ICV were used as covariates. The results suggest that a simple time and cost effective measure to improve signal to noise ratio in rare clinical populations with low prevalence rates is a second anatomical scan when structural MRI is of interest.

Yet, neuroanatomical findings in transgender persons remain highly discrepant possibly due to a variety of factors including sexual orientation [4, 5] , genetics [6] , hormonal factors [7] as well as small size of the cohorts [8] . In addition, cultural factors have remained unexplored to date as the majority of transgender neuroimaging has been conducted in Western populations [2] .\nIn terms of neuroanatomical differences between the sexes, large-scale studies and metaanalyses have tried to identify typical anatomical patterns for cisgender men (male at-birth assigned sex and male gender identity) and cisgender women (female at-birth assigned sex and female gender identity) [9, 10] . These findings are regionally specific but curiously, also partly discrepant. For example, Ruigrok et al. [10] reported that, on average, males have larger grey matter volume (GMV) in the putamen and the cerebellum, whereas females have, on average, larger volume of the right frontal pole and parietal cortex. Interestingly, while the meta-analysis of Ruigrok et al. [10] from several different cultures indicated larger thalamic volume in women relative to men, the single population study (with a larger sample size) of British participants by Ritchie et al. [9] documented larger thalamic volume for men relative to women. Highly regionally-specific findings are further exemplified by a recent analysis which showed it to be rare that brains consistently belong to either extreme ends of the maleness-femaleness spectrum are rare and that they rather are \"mosaics\" of male and female features [11] . This mosaic model could be further supported by the findings of Lombardo et al. [12] who showed an association between fetal testosterone level -as measured in utero through amniocentesis-and GMV in bilateral somatosensory, motor, and premotor cortices in With regards to the \"maleness-femaleness\" spectrum, Guillamon et al. [1] postulated that trans people demonstrate different extents of phenotypically male and female brain patterns, with trans women displaying some demasculinized patterns and trans men some defeminized patterns. This yields their own unique brain patterns and possibly shifting trans men's brains towards those of cis men and trans women's brains towards those of cis women. However, findings have been inconsistent. Some studies show female-typical brain patterns for trans women in hypothalamus [14] , left pre-and postcentral gyri [15] , or nucleus accumbens [16] , while others find brain patterns consistent with the sex-assigned at birth in putamen, precentral gyrus [17] and frontal lobe [18] . Such inconsistencies are found among different anatomical measures including GMV and cortical thickness [16, [19] [20] [21] , as well as cortical surface area [16, 20] . Ongoing extensive research is required to achieve consistency and conclusive results.\nYet, as noted above, an important caveat to bear in mind is the typical small sample sizes used in neuroimaging studies of transgender persons which imposes great limitation to reach definitive conclusions regarding anatomical patterns. While this factor is inherent to cohorts with small prevalence, prior work in healthy and neurological cohorts has suggested that using a second MRI scan might improve power, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and reliability [22] [23] [24] . In a large cohort of healthy elderly participants (64+ years), Liem et al. [23] examined reliability within sessions of two anatomical scans taken 30 minutes apart and concluded that variance due to measurement error can be decreased and SNR increased by simply scanning additional participants. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, [25] has also demonstrated the utility of additional scans in a neurological cohort. [23] and neurological cohorts [25] , the second objective was to increase SNR and confidence in findings by collecting an additional second anatomical scan.\nTherefore, we focused on 10 a priori regions of interest that have been suggested to differ between cisgender males and females and also 2) implicated in prior reports of transgender neuroimaging [16, 17, [26] [27] [28] . These ten regions of interest (ROI) were the fusiform gyri, inferior parietal gyri, pre-and postcentral gyri, frontal poles, thalami, caudates, putamina and accumbens nuclei as well as the cerebellum."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Demographics", "text": "There were no significant differences in age between TM (Mean age = 24.37 years; SD = 5.35 years), TW (Mean = 24.87; SD = 6.2), CM (Mean = 26.03; SD = 5.25) and CW (Mean = 25.8; SD = 3.83) ( Table 1) . While there was no significant difference between CM and CW as well as TM and TW in their socioeconomic status (SES), cisgender participants had significantly higher SES compared to transgender participants (\u03c7(2) = 9.86, p = .007). A similar pattern emerged for the educational status: cisgender and transgender participants differed from one another (\u03c7(3) = 25.41, p < .001), but not within groups. More importantly, with regards to gender identity and sexual orientation, TM reported to have significantly more masculine gender identity compared to CM (t (68) = 2.27, p = .033) but they did not differ in sexual orientation (both were predominantly attracted to women), while TW and CW participants as determined through SCID-5 is presented in Table 1 ."}, {"section_title": "Anatomical differences between transgender and cisgender persons", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "GMV", "text": "For GMV, all ROIs showed significant effects of group except for the bilateral Accumbens nuclei ( Table 2) .

TW did not differ in any ROI Right frontal CSA was also smaller in TW relative to CM but not different from CW or TM (Table 3) ."}, {"section_title": "Comparing neuroanatomical measures for the two scans individually vs. a repeated measures model", "text": "The secondary objective of this study was to assess whether adding a second anatomical scan would improve reliability of our data. Primary group comparisons showed statistically significant differences in most a priori ROIs for GMV and CSA ( Table 2) .\nAlthough the repeated-measures model for main effects of group for our a priori ROIs did not show a substantial difference in p-values relative to when scans were analyzed individually ( Table 2) , corresponding correlations coefficients for these regions were different. Specifically, the analysis revealed a potential gain in SNR for most regions as correlation coefficients between the two MRI scans ranged between 0.705 to 0.996 ( Figure   2 ). Interestingly, the ROIs with the lowest correlation coefficients were the bilateral frontal poles for GMV and CSA, and bilateral accumbens nuclei, left putamen and left thalamus for subcortical volume. Moreover, although adding age and ICV as covariates did not impact the main effects (supplementary Table 3 ), when applied in the repeated measures analysis it did yield more statistically significant CSA differences in all regions except for the left frontal pole and more statistically significant GMV differences for the left precentral gyrus, left frontal pole, and left putamen ( Supplementary Table 1 )."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Given the current lack of comparative data [2] , the main goal of this study was to assess Endocrinological data from the ENIGI project have demonstrated the utility and necessity of providing cross-cultural data in transgender persons for the sake of generalizability. These prior data [29] have shown that sociodemographic characteristics such as the education level, age, or the amount of TM or TW presenting to the clinic may be country-specific. As with prior works from USA [26] and Sweden [17, 20] , the present findings across most of our a priori ROIs, suggest a closer neuroanatomical resemblance of transgender persons to the group they share their at-birth assigned sex with, specifically in TW. For TM, the finding was a little different, showing reduced GMV in fusiform and thalamic volume relative to CW and TM suggesting a unique profile that is different from those with shared at-birth assigned sex or gender identity. Importantly, this fusiform gyrus finding in an independent and non-Western sample has also been previously shown in a Belgian sample of hormone-treated trans persons [16] , highlighting it as a cross-cultural finding in transgender individuals.\nMoreover, this complex pattern indicates a differential neuroanatomical profile of transgender persons relative to each other and is consistent with the hypothesis of Guillamon et al. [1] . According to their hypothesis, cortical development that has already been shown to Sexual orientation may also contribute to the literature discrepancies. Guillamon et al. [1] and Savic and colleagues [4] hypothesized that sexual orientation may significantly contribute to the discrepant findings as it was not previously controlled for (e.g., [16, 26] or, instead, the sample sizes were very small [15] . One strength of the present study was that both transgender and cisgender participants strongly identified with their respective gender identities and were only attracted to one other sex therefore excluding a potential confound of sexual orientation and further reducing measurement variance. Luders consistent with shared gender identity in left-lateralized parietal and temporal cortices in TW and TM, respectively. When they reran the analyses, this time including cis women who were attracted to women and cis men who were attracted to men using Kinsey sexual orientation scores as a covariate, both the partly \"female pattern\" in TW and partly \"male pattern\" in TM disappeared. However, these findings only emerged in cortical thickness but not in volumetric measures (with surface area not being reported). In the present study, possibly because of the homogenous sample distribution, covarying for sexual orientation did not change any of the measurements of interest. Therefore, it remains to be seen whether sexual orientation or brain measurement type (or a combination of the two) is a major influence on the findings. Interestingly, an additional contributor to divergent findings might be that available studies differ in using absolute vs. relative values, and whether or not they correct for total brain volume. A case in point, sex effects between CM and CW disappeared when correcting for ICV. This may also explain some of the discrepancy between meta-analytic findings. Whereas Ruigrok et al. [10] combined (N=13) studies that either covaried for ICV (N=4), TBV (N=2), or GMV (N=7), with those that did not covary for any of these (N=3)(with 9/16 covarying for age), Ritchie et al. [9] provided both raw data measurements but computed statistics after only correcting for age. Future studies should always present both corrected and uncorrected data to facilitate future comparison.\nThe second goal of the present study was more of technical nature to examine how discrepancy in findings can be further reduced. Prior efforts in healthy (elderly) populations [23] and neurological cohorts such as Alzheimer's Disease [25] that the right putamen consistently differs in volume between transgender and cisgender persons, albeit in different directions [16, 17, 26] . Consistent with our hypotheses and prior work, correlation coefficients were high suggesting good reliability in the FreeSurfer pipeline. However, although correlation coefficients in many regions were .90, none had a perfect correlation (except the cerebellum). Strikingly, subcortical structures such as putamen, nucleus accumbens and thalamus, as well as regions close to the edge of the brain (the frontal poles) exhibited relatively low correlations, suggesting that structural studies with a focus on these brain regions may benefit from adding a second scan to increase reliability.\nOn the one hand, these finidings point to the need for increased sample sizes or additional scans, and on the other hand, for refinement of presently available toolboxes such as FreeSurfer to improve algorithms of parsing anatomical regions in order to increase the reliability in these areas. The present findings may be of particular interest for researchers aiming to pinpoint the underlying neural architecture of basic brain processes including reward processing [31] , motor processing [32] , theory of mind [33] , or nociception and pain [34] .\nSome potential limitations of the current study merit notion. Firstly, some have expressed doubts on reliability of self-reports on gender identity or sexual orientation in Iranian samples because of the socio-political context and the Islamic republic jurisdiction. For example, as shown by Khorashad et al. [35, 36] , both transgender and intersex participants scored higher on the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI) compared to cisgender participants. Based on the Gender Self-Socialization Model (GSSM) by Tobin [37] , Khorashad et al. [35] proposed that increased scores of ASI among individuals whose gender identity is incongruent with all or some of their physical features could be an attempt to attain gender typicality. The same concept might be at play, leading them towards exaggerating their self-reported stance on gender identity and sexual orientation spectrums. Such factors constituted another strong Secondly, with regards to the methodological concerns, it is important to note that we \"only\" performed the present study on a 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner and that 3 Tesla scanners might yield higher SNR. Nevertheless, the present findings serve as an important illustration that subcortical structures or structures close to the edge of the brain may particularly benefit from additional careful steps to increase SNR in any setting. It is also important to note that the test-retest approach to increase the reliability may have its own limitations; staying longer in the scanner and factors such as head motion that increase the noise might be pertinent.\nFuture studies may focus on improvement of MRI sequences or the analysis algorithms and softwares that parse and measure these ROI.\nIn summary, this study largely replicated findings from prior works in Western cultures and extended them to a Middle Eastern population. Notably, not only the study replicated the important finding of reduced GMV in the right fusiform gyrus in trans men compared to cis women (a finding that was specific to these groups), it also found the right thalamus as an additional region of difference among the two groups. Moreover, using a second scan appeared to improve findings in subcortical structures or regions close to the edge of the brain (frontal poles), thus being relevant for neuroimaging research in other clinical groups with small prevalence rates when anatomical data is of interest [38, 39] .

For sexual orientation, 0 represented predominantly attracted to men and 10 predominantly attracted to women ( Table 1) .\nAll participants were evaluated regarding their lifetime psychiatric diagnoses.

The recon-all command was used, which runs the preprocessing steps including bias field correction, intensity normalization, motion correction and skull stripping among others.\nThen quality control procedures were followed as per ENIGMA protocol (http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/training/) which also involved visual inspection of subject-bysubject outputs to identify possible misclassifications."}, {"section_title": "Data analysis", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Neuroimaging data", "text": "As noted in the introduction, our ten a priori ROIs (bilateral) were selected based on previous literature. This selection sought to balance 1) the groups that have previously published on anatomical differences in transgender persons to avoid implicit biases in region selection, 2) identify regions with inconsistent findings, and 3) used functional data that indicated sensitivity to sex hormones [16, 17, [26] [27] [28] given a hypothesized role of sex hormones in being transgender [44] . However, to keep the number of regions low (to retain sufficient statistical power), a balance between cortical and subcortical regions was sought ( Figure 1 ). A mixed model was fitted for every ROI and a random intercept for each subject.\nAn analysis of variance (ANOVA, with the between subject factor of group: CM, CW, TM, TW) was run using the False Discovery Rate (FDR) to correct for multiple comparisons at the ROI level, i.e., for the number of ROIs (p<.05, FDR corrected) 1 . This was done separately for the independent variables of volume, surface area, and cortical thickness. Regions that showed significant differences on the average scan were further investigated with post-hoc paired t-tests to determine which groups were driving the effects. Bonferroni was then used to correct for multiple comparisons within each ROI. Decision for the respective use of these two methods was made on the notion that FDR seemed more appropriate for the overall None of the 10 ROIs survived the threshold of significance for CTh (with or without using covariates). As such, no post-hoc analysis was performed on this measure. Statistics regarding CTh will therefore no longer be mentioned here (see Table 4 for raw mean/SD). 1 Previous studies differ on whether they examine absolute or relative volume differences and therefore whether they use some form of correcting for whole brain volume (total brain volume (TBV), total grey matter volume (GMV), intracranial volume (ICV)). One goal of the present study was to compare and replicate the previous findings of . Since they covaried for age and ICV, the mixed models were re-run with these two covariates included to facilitate direct comparison with that prior study ( Supplementary Table 4 ). Additional analyses with sexual orientation as a covariate did not change the findings. "}]
