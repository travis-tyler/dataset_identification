After a brief summary of total doctoral degrees produced by all universities, the details of Ph.D. production by land-grant universities in fields of science associated with agriculture and home economics are presented.

The skills associated with doctorates in the sciences are different from other areas. The Doctor of Philosophy, a research degree, is awarded in the sciences to signify excellence in the mastery of an appropriate body of scientific knowl edge and in skills to perform research through application of the scientific method. Doctorates awarded in the humanities signify mastery of a body of knowl edge having primarily cultural character. Doctorates awarded in education and the professions (medicine, law, dentistry, etc.) signify mastery of a body of knowledge and skills appropriate for practicing a particular profession. These latter two doctorates are nonresearch degrees. Historically, the first doctoral degree was conferred by Yale University in 1861, and currently more than 300 universities are granting doctoral degrees. In 120 years, about 765,000 doctorates have been awarded by U.S. institutions in all fields (sciences, engineering, humanities, education, professions). About-fields, and 72 percent have been awarded during the last eighteen years, 1965-82. The leading universities In total number of doct.oral degrees awarded have changed over time from the Ivy League private universities to the large state univer sities, I.e., University of California-Berkeley, University of Wisconsin, Univer sity of Illlnols-Urbana, the University of Michigan."}, {"section_title": "Fields Associated vlth Agriculture and Home Economics", "text": "In this study, nineteen science fields associated with agricultural and home economics are considered (see Table 1). Most of the fields are In agricultural sciences. Other fields are basic science fields that are generally administered by departments outside the colleges of agriculture; e.g., biochemistry, genetics,  Table 2). Fifty years later, all fifty-one of the land-grant universities were awarding Ph.D. degrees In one or more of these twenty fields. The long-term compound average growth rate in number of Ph.D. degrees awarded by land-grant *^^^v\u00ae^sltles in the 19 fields associated with agriculture and home economics Is 6.9 percent . Over the 6Q-year period, 1920-79, these fifty-one landgrant universities awarded more than 39,093 Ph.D. degrees In these fields. Sixty-two percent of these degrees were awarded during the last fifteen years of the period, 1965-79. Figure 1 shows the pattern over time of Ph.D. degrees awarded by the fiftyone land-grant unversitles for field groups: (1) total over all nineteen fields, (2) over thirteen fields (excludes six basic science fields), (3) in applied agricultural production science fields (field group I Includes: agronocQr, soils and soil sciences, horticulture, animal husbandry, animal science and nutrition, veterinary medicine, agricultural engineering, and general and other agriculture, and (4) in basic science fields for agriculture (field group II Includes: food and agricultural chemistry, biochemistry, animal physiology, plant physiology, plant and animal physiology, and genetics). The total number of Ph.D. degrees awarded in the nineteen field group grew rapidly in the early ten-year period 1920-29, but the Great Depression of 1929-33 slowed this growth rate, and World War II caused a sharp reversal starting in Some other trends\u00bb which are not included in Figure 1,  degrees awarded. This study groups states by the tenn USDA-ERS farm production regions (see Figure 2).  Table 3). The Appalachian region. Southern Plains, Mountain, Northern received Ph.D. degrees in these fields or 7.4 percent of the recipients were female (see Table 3). The share of Ph.D. degrees awarded to women differs across fields over time. In the five-year Interval 1960-64, only eighteen Ph.D. degrees were awarded to women in the applied agricultural production field group (I) or less than 1 percent of all degrees in this group, and twenty-four Ph.D. degrees were awarded in the agricultural production maintenance field group or 2.1 percent of the total. The largest number (364) and largest share (13.7%) of total degrees awarded to women in a field group were awarded in the basic science for agricul-. ture group (II) during this early period. recipients who earned their bachelor's degrees abroad, being 7-9 of the doctorate total percent until the 1960*s, then the trend is sharply upward (Harmon 1978, p. 47 This study has focused on the production of scientists in nineteen fields of science associated with agriculture and home economics. These fields cover applied agricultural sciences; basic agricultural sciences; production mainte nance sciences; and food, nutrition, and economic sciences* The main findings a r e : 1\u00bb The fifty-one land-grant universities produced 39,000 Ph.D. degrees In these nineteen fields over the sixty-year period 1920 to 1979. Sixty-two percent of these degrees were awarded during the last fifteen years of this period. However, the number of Ph.D. degrees awarded per year peaked in 1971 and has trended downward since then. 3. The production of Ph.D. degrees in these nineteen fields and in most of the individual fields is concentrated geographically in the Midwestern states. In the ten USDA agricultural production regions, the Corn Belt states are the leading grantors of Ph.D. degrees in these fields for the sixty-year period and for the last fifteen years. The Lake states are second, the Northeast is third, and the Pacific Region is fourth. Three characteristics of Ph.D. recipients were focused upon in this study: sex, citizenship, and postdoctoral activity. Additional findings are:  As one means of condensing the annual data on earned degrees, five-year aggregates were formed. Much of the discussion uses these five-year aggregates rather than annual data.   1920-1924 1950-1954 ' 1975 -1979 No. of   1920-1924 1950-\u20221954 1975--1979 No In fiscal year 1962, \"Physiology\" was broken into \"Animal Physiology\" and \"Plant Physiology.\" \"Animal Science\" was added in fiscal year 1973.
