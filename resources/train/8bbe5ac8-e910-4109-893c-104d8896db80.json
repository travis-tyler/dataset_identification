Worldwide prevalence of AD is expected to rise to over 100 million by 2050 [1] . Many studies provide evidence suggesting that AD progresses by selective degeneration of neuronal populations in several brain regions. 1 Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu). As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report.

Tel.: +1 650 724 3333; E-mail: tanyagl@stanford.edu.\nThe hippocampus is one of the earliest structures to be affected [2] . Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a prodromal stage of AD with a conversion rate of about 10% [3] . Studying why only certain individuals with MCI develop AD is fundamental to understanding the diseases and developing accurate prognostic indicators. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of AD patients reveals overall volume loss and shape changes in specific brain structures, such as the hippocampus, amygdala, corpus callosum, and other regions [4] . Fig. 1 shows a comparison of coronal and axial views of T1-weighted MR scans: a healthy 79-year-old female on the left, and a 74-year-old female diagnosed with AD on the right. The left hippocampi and lateral ventricles are shown in detail on the side panels. An overall tissue loss is apparent in the late-stage AD patient. As neurons die, the brain parenchyma shrinks, leading to passive enlargement 288 of the brain ventricles. The purpose of this work is to explore the subtle changes in shape of brain structures most affected by AD. We develop shape descriptors to capture and quantify these changes, and test their efficacy as imaging biomarkers for automatic classification of the following populations: MCI patients who progressed to AD, AD patients, and normal controls (NC). We are using a novel 3D shape descriptor, combining information from an ensemble of brain structures and employing machine learning. We evaluate our framework on a cohort of 375 subjects available through the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), compare our results to other methods, and perform an analysis of the significance of the different features we extract."}, {"section_title": "T. Glozman et al. / Shape-Attributes of Brain Structures as Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease", "text": "\nRecently, most attention has focused on the ROI-based approach which analyzes the volume or shape of a specific brain structure. The hippocampus has received most attention, with classification based on volume or shape-related features. Examples to the latter are [26] and [27] , where spherical harmonics (SPHARM) coefficients calculated on the hippocampi are used as a feature vector for the classification. Some recent work has focused on understanding the change in brain ventricles as well [28] [29] [30] . These shape-related features are also referred to as shape-descriptors as they describe some attribute of the 3D shape. A comprehensive survey on shape representation can be found in [31] . A comprehensive survey of 3D shape descriptors can be found in [32] .\nIn the context of machine learning, descriptors are referred to as features, and a set of descriptors per shape is referred to as feature vector. The most common and direct way to differentiate between NC, AD, and MCI populations is the volumetric analysis, in which volumes of different brain structures are compared across subjects. These studies differ in the chosen ROIs, the method by which the segmentation of the ROIs is obtained, and the statistical methods used for data analysis. Some examples are [33, 34] . A limitation of the volume-based methods is the inability to capture the more subtle shape changes which happen on a local scale. This limitation is what our work attempts to address.\nA recent work [35] has utilized a classical computer vision method [36] and kernel-SVMs for classification of AD subjects and the brain regions most related to the disease. They modified the EigenBrain method first introduced by [37] and proved its effectiveness in AD subject prediction and discriminating affected brain regions on MRI data. In another recent work [38] , an average 'displacement field' is calculated between key-slices in the MRI data between AD subjects and normal controls. These displacement field images are then reduced by principle component analysis and classification is performed by three different SVM variants. This method achieves an impressive classification accuracy on a subset of data from the OASIS dataset (http://www.oasis-brains.org/).\nOur work suggests a different approach-our focus is not on the images directly, but rather on the shapes of brain structures affected by AD. The features we derive are shape based and thus capture the subtle changes in tissue degeneration of an ensemble of brain structures.\nIdentifying MCI subjects that are prone to convert to clinical AD is crucial in developing efficient early prognostic indicators and treatment plans that may delay the onset of cognitive and behavioral symptoms and ultimately improve the quality of life for AD patients and their caregivers. In this paper, we described a fully automatic framework for classification of AD, MCIc, and normal controls. We incorporate shape information from an ensemble of regions of interests in the brain and utilize machine learning approach to build a classifier for each of these populations. The framework is modular, allowing a user-defined choice of ROIs and feature descriptors. In this work we chose to limit the number of structures and focused on the hippocampi and the ventricles. Our framework achieves classification accuracy of 88.13% for NC versus MCIc outperforming other methods. We believe that several factors contribute to this improvement: (1) using an ensemble of ROIs rather than using a single ROI (e.g., hippocampus) or the whole brain data. The ROIs we chose in this study are the structures we believe manifest most shape change in AD; (2) using shape descriptors rather than voxel value data. This allowed us to use a compact descriptor per subject -only 32 numbers. Given the modest amount of data available for training and evaluation, using compact descriptor benefits the classifier learning and avoids overfitting.\nThe descriptors we used in this work are simple to compute, allow compact representation of the shape, and are effective for classification as they capture the subtle shape changes caused by tissue degeneration. A vast variety of other shape representation exists (see [31] for a comprehensive survey) and may be explored in future work.\nIn addition to classification, and perhaps more important, is the ability of our framework to automatically identify the structures most affected by the disease. We explored the discriminative power of the different structures and their shape attributes. The hippocampus was automatically found to be the most important structure for the classifier, a notion well supported by the literature. We are encouraged by these results and in future development of this framework we plan to build upon this ability and expand the ROI inputs to identify other potential affected areas. Utilization of this framework in identification of most affected structures in other neurological disorders is also an exciting avenue to explore."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu) [5] .

The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD). For up-to-date information, see http://www.adniinfo.org. For comparison to other methods, we used the same dataset as reported in [6] for three groups of subjects: 162 cognitively normal elderly controls (CN), 137 patients with AD, and 76 patients with MCI who had converted to AD within 18 months (MCIc). Demographic characteristics of the studied population can be found in [6] . Details about data pre-processing can be found in [5] ."}, {"section_title": "Processing framework overview", "text": "The main contribution of this work is a computational framework that performs automatic classification between different types of dementia, namely MCIc and AD. We achieve top performance in identifying the MCI patients that will convert to Alzheimer's within 18 months (MCIc). This section is an overview of the processing steps. Details about each step can be found in following subsections.\nThe inputs to our framework are the T1-weighted MR images preprocessed with the Freesurfer image analysis suite, freely available at http://freesurfer.net [7] . Freesurfer outputs a 3D segmentation of 115 cortical and subcortical brain structures according to the Desikan-Killiany Atlas [8] . A subset of 8 regions of interest (ROIs) (see below) is chosen and processed separately: first, a projection of the ROI on its principal plane is calculated (see Projections for details). 2D shape descriptors are calculated for each ROI, resulting in only 6 values per ROI (see Shape descriptor calculation for details). We then construct a 32-long feature vector for each subject by concatenating the feature values from all ROIs. These steps are repeated for all subjects in the dataset.\nFollowing this processing, the dataset is split in half: 50% used for training the classifier, and the rest is used for test and evaluation. To find the optimal training parameters, we performed 5-fold cross validation on the training set (see SVM Classication for details). Finally, we test our model on the independent testing set, evaluate its performance and compare to other methods (see Comparison to other methods for details). Additionally, in order to understand the importance of each brain structure and its derived features for the classification, we perform feature analysis experiments (see Feature analysis experiments for details)."}, {"section_title": "Data preprocessing and ROI extraction", "text": "It is commonly accepted that at progressive stages of AD, degeneration of brain tissue occurs, leading to structural changes in several brain structures (see [4] for a list of supporting research), including the hippocampi and the ventricles [9] .

For each ROI, we first find the principal axes of the 3D shape using the NIPALS algorithm for principal component analysis (PCA) [10] . We project each ROI onto the plane spanned by the first two principal components. Then, to calculate the projection, we first partition the 2D plane into H \u00d7 W bins, where the values of H and W are of the order of 20 to 40 pixels, unique for each ROI type, but kept the same (normalized) across all subjects for the specific ROI. The value of each pixel f (i, j) on the H \u00d7 W projection matrix is obtained by counting how many pointsx ( ) fall into the (i,j)th bin. More formally,\nwhere {\u00b7} is the indicator function and the division by maximal value is used for normalization. This allows canonical representation of the different shapes, and reduces the dimensionality of the data from a 3D grid of up to 10000 points to a 2D image of up to 1000 pixels. The resulting 2D image can be viewed as a distribution matrix, which captures the density of the point distribution from a viewpoint determined by the ROI self coordinate system (principal directions). Fig. 2 shows an example of such projections."}, {"section_title": "Shape descriptor calculation", "text": "We encode the information of the 2D projection image in a compact feature descriptor. In this work we focused on moments [11] and entropy. Moments have been widely used in statistics to describe the shape of a probability density function, in computer vision to describe the shape of objects, e.g., [12] and in classic rigid-body mechanics to describe the distribution of mass in a body. The equation for central moment of order p + q is\nwhere f (i, j) is the image intensity at location (i, j), and (\u012b,j) is the centroid of the image. A uniqueness theorem by Hu [11] states that the moment sequence \u03bc pq uniquely determines the original f (i, j). In practice, a few lower order moments are sufficient. In this work, we have empirically determined that the following moment set is sufficient for the ROI characterization: {\u03bc 11 , \u03bc 12 , \u03bc 22 }. Entropy of a 2D shape is defined as:\nTogether, these features carry information about the shape center of mass, its orientation, and amount of uncertainty each pixel contributes to the overall shape. In addition to these four features per ROI, we estimate the volumes of the structures listed above by counting the number of voxels in each ROI. Thus, we have a total of five features per ROI: {\u03bc 11 , \u03bc 12 , \u03bc 22 , e, V } for ROIs 1-4 listed above. An additional two features came from estimates of volumes of the cerebral white matter in the left and right hemispheres. Hence we have a total of 5*6 + 2 = 32 features per subject. The features were normalized by the maximal value of each feature type across the entire cohort. "}, {"section_title": "T. Glozman et al. / Shape-Attributes of Brain Structures as Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification", "text": "SVM is a supervised learning algorithm widely used in various scientific disciplines (e.g., [13, 14] ).

Given a training set of size K: (x k , y k ) k=1...K , where x k \u2208 R d are observations and y k \u2208 {\u22121, 1} are the corresponding labels, an SVM classifier aims to find a hyperplane that maximizes the separation between the two classes labeled by {\u22121, 1}. The decision surface for a linear SVM classifier is given by y(x) = w T x \u2212 b. The use of a linear SVM allows us to later use the learned weights of the different features to understand which brain regions were mostly affected by the disease. The feature weight vector w and bias b are learned on the training set as the solution to an optimization problem. We performed 5-fold crossvalidation on the training set to find the optimal error-cost parameter. In the k-fold cross validation method, the data are randomly partitioned into k subsets. Each of the k iterations, (k-1) subsets are used to train the classifier and the remaining data is used for testing. The cost parameter which yielded the highest cross-validation accuracy is then used to train the classifier on the full training set.

We evaluate the performance using the following measures: classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and d' [17, 18] . Sensitivity is defined as TP/(TP+FN), measuring the proportion of correctly identified patients; Specificity is defined as TN/(TN+FP), measuring the proportion of correctly identified controls; Classification error is defined as (TP+TN) / (TP+TN+FP+FN), measures the proportion of examples that are correctly labeled by the classifier. d' is a discriminability index widely used in signal detection theory and psychology [19] .

In [6] , no single method achieved a good performance across all classification tasks, thus comparison to top-performing method was not possible. Instead, in Fig. 3 , we summarize the results of other methods as errorbar plots and present the comparison of our single framework results as a red bold circle. Our method achieves good results on both tasks and outperforms all other methods in NC versus MCIc classification: the highest-performing methods on NC versus MCIc classification task reached specificity above 85% but a sensitivity value between 51% and 73%. Our method achieves specificity of 93.83% and sensitivity of 75.68%.

To do this, we repeated the AD versus NC experiments on train/test sets created by randomly partitioning the dataset 100 times. Due to the limited amount of data for this random partitioning, we could not require the gender/age balance to be preserved. Thus these experiments were not used to evaluate the classifier performance, but rather only to understand the weights distribution. Each experiment provided a classifier model with weights assigned to each feature. These provide insight on the diagnosticity of the different brain regions and their shape attributes in classification of AD patients from the normal population.

A comprehensive review of these studies can be found in [6] . Previous work can be roughly categorized into two groups depending on the types of features extracted 292 from MRI data. Voxel-based techniques use the most basic information of the data -intensity values of the voxels (i.e., the probability of a voxel belonging to one of three tissue types: gray matter, white matter, or cerebrospinal fluid) as the training data for the classifier. Some examples of these works are [23, 24] . Most methods, however, begin with segmentation of the brain into different structures/tissues. Image processing feature extraction techniques are then employed to reduce the dimensionality of the imaging data prior to the classification. These methods differ by the feature extraction methods, the considered ROIs and the classification techniques. In [25] for example, all brain structures are utilized in the classification: voxels are first grouped into regions by registration with a labeled atlas. Intensity histograms of all ROIs are then used as feature vectors, fed into a statistical learning framework."}]
