The BPS followed a nationally representative sample of approximately 17,000 students who entered postsecondary education for the first time in the 2003-04 academic year for a period of 6 years. During those years, students in the BPS:04/09 cohort attended more than 3,000 postsecondary institutions. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) requested transcripts from every institution BPS:04/09 students attended between July 2003 and June 2009. Around 2,620 institutions (86 percent) provided transcripts. Across the institution types represented, participation in the transcript collection ranged from 93 percent among public 4-year doctorate-granting institutions to 71 percent among private forprofit less-than-4-year institutions. 1 Coenrollment refers to overlapping periods of postsecondary enrollment at two or more institutions. It should not be confused with dual enrollment or overlapping dates of enrollment between a secondary school and postsecondary institution. See Wang and Wickersham (2014) for more information. The study collected complete transcript histories for 16,110 students (87 percent) and at least one transcript from 16,960 students (92 percent). The resulting data provide a detailed portrait of students' enrollment, course-taking, credit accumulation, academic performance, and degree histories."}, {"section_title": "Selected Findings", "text": "Selected findings from this report include the following: \u2022 About one-third (35 percent) of first-time beginning undergraduate students transferred or coenrolled at least once during the 6-year period of the BPS study. Approximately 21 percent transferred/coenrolled once, and another 11 percent transferred/coenrolled more than once. 2 The remaining two-thirds (65 percent) did not transfer or coenroll. \u2022 Most transfers or coenrollments (56 percent) originated from public 2-year institutions. Because a transfer can be defined by either the movement of students or the movement of credits from one institution to another institution, this report used two measures to better characterize transfers: (1) opportunity for credit transfer, 3 a student-focused measure, and (2) actual credit transfers, 4 a credit-focused measure. Public 2-year institutions yielded approximately 1.4 million of the 2.6 million opportunities for credit transfer and 19.1 million of the 30.0 million credits transferred. \u2022 Nearly 90 percent of all student credit transfer opportunities occurred between institutions that were regionally, rather than nationally, accredited. \u2022 A multivariate analysis of actual credit transfer indicated that, after taking into account other student and institutional factors: 5 \uf0a2 a student's GPA prior to a transfer was related positively to the number of credits accepted at the destination institution; \uf0a2 student transfer/coenrollment 6 pathways were related to credit transfer, specifically when compared to students transferring from 2-year to 4-year 7 institutions (i.e., vertical transfer): \u2022 transferring from 4-year to 2-year institutions (i.e., reverse transfer) was related negatively to the number of credits accepted following transfer; and \u2022 transferring from 2-year to 2-year institutions or 4-year to 4-year institutions (i.e., horizontal transfer) was related negatively to the number of credits accepted following transfer."}, {"section_title": "\uf0a2", "text": "Institutional control was related to the number of credits transferred, with students moving to private for-profit and private nonprofit institutions transferring fewer credits than students moving to public institutions. \uf0a2 Accreditation status was unrelated to the number of credits transferred between institutions. These findings indicate that students who follow traditionally articulated pathways in postsecondary education-most notably from 2-year to 4-year institutions-are typically able to transfer credits successfully."}, {"section_title": "Caveats for Readers", "text": "This report focuses on students' first transfer experience because institutional transcripts make it difficult to identify the origin of a given credit after subsequent student transfers/coenrollments (i.e., not all institutions itemize transfer credits, making it difficult to identify the source institution). Because students who transfer 5 These factors include control of the origin institution and destination institutions; transfer direction (i.e., vertical [2-year to 4-year], horizontal [4-year to 4-year or 2-year to 2-year], or reverse [4-year to 2-year]); accreditation status of origin and destination institutions; academic performance (i.e., GPA); selectivity of the origin and destination institutions; and the months enrolled prior to transfer. 6 Because the focus of this report is credit transfer, student transfer and coenrollment were not disaggregated. For coenrolled students, potential transfer opportunities and the direction of credit transfer are identified using the beginning and end dates of attendance at each institution to determine the order of attendance. 7 Institutions that offer 4-year degrees but are predominantly associate's-degree-granting institutions were reclassified as 2-year. Both institutional level and institutional sector were adjusted accordingly. only once may differ from those who transfer more than once, appendix D compares these populations on a small set of student and institutional characteristics. While the results in appendix D show some differences between the two groups, multipletransfer students are not likely to contribute much bias to the analysis because they are not being excluded (only data related to their subsequent transfers/coenrollments are excluded) and represent only 9 percent of the weighted cases. It is important to note three limitations associated with this analysis: \u2022 First, the analysis cannot determine if a student who intended to transfer was discouraged from doing so based on misinformation or other reasons and, therefore, made no attempt to do so. \u2022 Second, although this analysis can observe the movement of a student between institutions, it cannot discern the reasons credit may not transfer. The transfer of credit is driven by both student and institutional decisions. Students may elect to transfer only part of their prior coursework to a destination institution, or may choose not to navigate the destination institution's transfer process at all. Similarly, institutions have the freedom to establish their own policies for the acceptance of credits earned at other institutions. According to the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO), institutions should consider a variety of factors when awarding credit for prior learning, including quality and curricular applicability. 8 \u2022 Third, sample sizes are low for some subgroups. Specifically, there was a lower volume of students transferring to and from less-than-2-year institutions, which resulted in a low sample size for analysis. As a result, there are fewer opportunities to observe whether credits earned at one institution might be accepted by another for this group.

Federal policymakers, therefore, have had a continuing interest in understanding the ability of students to transfer credits between postsecondary institutions. In 2005, the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and the House Education and Workforce Committee requested that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) examine factors that influence the transferability of postsecondary credit. The GAO considered \u2022 how postsecondary education institutions decide which credits to accept for transfer; \u2022 how states and accrediting agencies facilitate the credit transfer process; and \u2022 the implications for students and the federal government of students' inability to transfer credits (GAO 2005). More recently, the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 required institutions participating in Title IV student aid programs to disclose additional information about their policies surrounding the transfer of credit. The Act states Each institution of higher education participating in any program under [Title IV] shall publicly disclose, in a readable and comprehensible manner, the transfer of credit policies established by the institution which shall include a statement of the institution's current transfer of credit policies that includes, at a minimum-(A) any established criteria the institution uses regarding the transfer of credit earned at another institution of higher education; and (B) a list of institutions of higher education with which the institution has established an articulation agreement. Given that policymakers have identified the transfer of credit as an issue of interest, this report examines how often, and under what conditions, postsecondary institutions accept the transfer of credits earned by students at other institutions. Using transcript data from the 2004/09 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:04/09), this report addresses the following questions: \u2022 How often do members of a cohort of beginning college students transfer or coenroll between postsecondary education institutions during their undergraduate years? \u2022 How often, and in what amounts, do credits transfer when students move from one institution to another? \u2022 What characteristics of institutions (i.e., control, level, accreditation, and selectivity) and students (i.e., grade point average [GPA] and degree/award level of program) are related to credit transfer? This report addresses these questions in three chapters. Chapter 1 addresses the first two research questions, providing nationally representative estimates of the number of undergraduate students who transferred from their first institution and whether the credits they earned were transferred to destination institutions. Chapter 2 documents the relationship between selected student or institutional characteristics and credit transfer. Specifically, it provides tables on credit transfer by the following factors: \u2022 academic performance, as measured by GPA; \u2022 type of undergraduate credential sought (i.e., certificate, associate's degree, bachelor's degree); \u2022 the institutional control (i.e., public/private) of origin and destination institutions; \u2022 the predominant degree level awarded by origin and destination institutions; \u2022 the accreditation status of origin and destination institutions; and \u2022 the selectivity of origin and destination institutions. Definitions for each variable can be found in appendix A. Finally, because credit transfer may be associated with these student and institutional characteristics in combination, chapter 3 reports the results of a multivariate analysis designed to control for these variables' joint associations with credit transfer."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Approximately 32 percent of first-time students in the 2003-04 academic year transferred at some point within 6 years of their first enrollment (Staklis, Bersudskaya, and Horn 2011). Within this same cohort, approximately 9 percent of bachelor's degree-seeking students starting at a public or private nonprofit 4-year institution, and 8 percent of students starting at a public 2-year institution were coenrolled (Wang and McCready 2013). While a sizeable minority of students transfer or coenroll between institutions, credits earned at one institution may not move with them to the other. To address this loss of credits, institutions, as well as state and federal governments, have created policies designed to facilitate the transfer of credit. Institutions, for example, have developed articulation agreements with other institutions to ensure the joint recognition of credits. The federal government has attempted to facilitate the transfer process by requiring institutions to post the criteria that are used for determining whether credits are transferred (GAO 2005). Finally, states have enacted a variety of laws and regulations to increase the ease and efficiency with which students can transfer credits from one institution to another."}, {"section_title": "Examples include", "text": "\u2022 statewide common course numbering systems; \u2022 statewide articulation agreements between public institutions; \u2022 standardized general education requirements; \u2022 mandated acceptance of transfer credit for specific courses; and \u2022 policies or guidelines to improve the transfer of credit (GAO 2005, pp. 28-34). Even with these interventions, when students transfer from one institution to another, credits earned at the first institution may not move with them. Limited information is available about why these initiatives are not successful. While the academic literature on student transfer has examined factors that may be related to moving from one institution to another or the persistence/attainment of transfer students, few studies are available that examine the transfer of credits (Roksa and Keith 2008). While not directly focused on credit transfer, research studies that focus on student transfer/coenrollment 1 (rather than credit transfer) do provide enough information to develop hypotheses on factors that may be related to credit transfer. Direction of transfer or coenrollment. Many scholars (Bahr 2012;McCormick 1997McCormick , 2003Peter and Forrest-Cataldi 2005;Goldrick-Rab 2006;Goldrick-Rab and Pfeffer 2009;Wang 2012) provide evidence that the direction of transfer is related to student success. On average, students who follow traditional transfer pathways from 2-year to 4-year institutions have better outcomes than other transfer students. Some researchers (Goldrick-Rab 2006;Goldrick-Rab and Pfeffer 2009;Wang 2012) observed that less advantaged students are more likely to use nontraditional pathways (e.g., from a 4-year institution to a 2-year institution), to their disadvantage. The results are similar for students who coenroll (Wang and Wickersham 2014). Credit transfer may be a contributing factor to these unfavorable outcomes because advanced courses from a 4-year institution may not be offered at the student's new 2-year institution. Transfer/coenrollment direction is examined in this report to understand if taking a nontraditional pathway is related to a higher loss of credits. Institutional characteristics. Other studies have examined the relationship between institutional characteristics and student or credit transfer, such as selectivity Dowd, Cheslock, and Melguizo 2008), the control/governance of INTRODUCTION the institution, or its accreditation (GAO 2005).  and Dowd, Cheslock, and Melguizo (2008) examined the relationship between selectivity and student transfer. They found that selective institutions typically have a lower proportion of low-socioeconomic-status (SES) students compared to other institutions. The analysis in chapter 3 includes selectivity to understand if a similar relationship exists between selectivity and the transfer of postsecondary credit. Additionally, in a report issued in 2005, the GAO postulated that institutions were using accreditation status as a factor in determining what credits may transfer. The GAO concluded that institutions are not accepting credit from national (rather than regional) accreditors and that it may disproportionately impact credits originating from for-profit institutions. The GAO findings, however, have not been examined in the academic literature. The analysis in this report includes institutional accreditation and institutional control to address questions raised by the GAO. Academic preparation. Academic preparation in high school (Melguizo 2009;Melguizo and Dowd 2009), academic performance in college (Graham and Dallam 1986;Diaz 1992;Hills 1965;Hughes and Graham 1992), academic intensity (Doyle 2009), and momentum (Doyle 2011) are also explored in the transfer literature. Across most studies, earlier academic success predicts student persistence and attainment among transfer students. The analysis in this report includes postsecondary academic variables immediately prior to transfer. Risk factors for stopping or dropping out. Certain risk factors identified from previous BPS studies are indicators of leaving postsecondary education without attaining a degree or credential (Horn 1996;Berkner, He, and Cataldi 2002). Such factors include dependency status (dependent and independent), single parent status, responsibility for dependents, employment status, type of high school credential, and postsecondary attendance intensity in the first year. Such factors may predict transfer as well. Type of academic program. The vocational focus of a community college program has also been investigated in the transfer literature Karabel 1989, 1991;Deng 2006;Dougherty 1987Dougherty , 1994Roksa 2006) with mixed results. An examination of the type of academic program is limited in this report due to the limited information reported on transcripts. The lack of availability of data on the transfer of academic credit has been a limitation of previous analyses (Roksa and Keith 2008). This statistical analysis report attempts to address this limitation in the literature by using nationally representative transcript data for first-time beginning students and examines the relationship between institutional and student characteristics and credit transfer to inform future policy discussions on this issue."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources", "text": "The analyses in this report use transcript data from the Postsecondary Education Transcript Study of 2009 (PETS:09), which is a component of the 2004/09 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:04/09).

During that time, students in the BPS:04/09 cohort attended more than 3,000 postsecondary institutions. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) collected transcripts through the 2008-09 academic year, creating a 6-year record of academic enrollment, including course-taking, credit accumulation, academic performance, and degree attainment. The estimates presented in this report were generated using Stata/IC (version 13.1) with a restricted-use data file (publication numbers NCES 2012-243 [BPS:04/09 transcripts] and NCES 2011-244 [BPS:04/09 interview, derived variables, and administrative data]; see http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/licenses.asp for licensing information). 2 BPS:04/09 sampling.

BPS sample members were first identified in the 2004 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), which employed a two-stage sampling design. In the first stage, NPSAS sampled institutions from the universe of all Title IV postsecondary education institutions. In the second stage, BPS sampled students from enrollment lists provided by sampled institutions. A total of 109,210 students were sampled from 1,630 postsecondary institutions.

Many students do not attend postsecondary institutions sequentially and will enroll in multiple institutions at once. Students attend multiple institutions to test the feasibility of a future transfer, take courses not offered at their home institution, accelerate the time to degree completion, or enroll in two different degree programs at two institutions simultaneously. Enrollment can alternate between two institutions, overlap, or be sequential (McCormick 2003). These patterns are also embedded in the BPS transcript data (Wang and Wickersham 2014;Wang and McCready 2013). Wang and Wickersham (2014) observed overlapping dates of enrollment in the BPS transcript data for 8.7 percent of students starting at 4-year institutions (2.2 percent at another 4-year institution and 6.2 percent at a 2-year institution). Among baccalaureate-aspiring students starting at 2-year institutions, 7.7 percent were coenrolled (1.5 percent at other 2-year institutions and 6.2 percent at 4-year institutions) (p. 9). While coenrollment does occur in the BPS transcript dataset, these enrollments were not entirely simultaneous (e.g., the enrollment start and end dates across coenrolled institutions were not identical). For the purposes of this report, coenrollment refers to overlapping periods of enrollment. While the type of multi-institutional enrollment pattern is important, credit transfer occurs regardless of the enrollment pattern. Because the focus of this report is credit transfer, the type of multi-institutional attendance was not disaggregated. Any reference to \"student transfer\" mentioned in this report includes students coenrolled at two or more institutions.

For students who attended more than one institution, \"student transfer\" or \"student transfer/coenrollment\" refers to the movement from one institution to another (with or without overlapping dates of enrollment). If a student returns to the original institution of attendance, the student is not considered to have transferred if the enrollment spell at the second institution is less than 4 months (see incidental transfer). Credits need not transfer. This analysis does not disaggregate student transfer from coenrollment. Credit hour. Typically, a credit hour refers to the unit of measure representing the equivalent of an hour (50 minutes) of instruction per week over the entire term of a semester system. It is applied toward the total number of credit hours needed for completing the requirements of a degree, diploma, certificate, or other formal award. For this study, the credit hour is dependent on how institutions implemented the measure. All course units on transcripts were normalized to reflect semester credits. Values for clock-hour institutions were divided by 37.5, and quarter-hour institutions were multiplied by two-thirds, so that all respondents had credit values on the same scale. Institutions that had unusual course unit systems were evaluated on a case-bycase basis. Credit transfer. For students who attended more than one institution, \"credit transfer\" refers to the recognition of credits earned at a prior institution by a second (or subsequent) institution of attendance. Unless explicitly stated, noncourse credits, credits awarded for experience in the workforce, or credits awarded for examination are not included in credit transfers. Remedial courses are included in the calculation of credits transferred if credit was awarded by the origin institution. 4 Incidental transfer/coenrollment.

In the case of the BPS study, a sample of 18,640 students was selected to represent the 3.7 million first-time beginning undergraduate students in Title IV postsecondary institutions in academic year 2003-04. The practice of selecting a sample versus selecting all students introduces statistical uncertainty about how accurately the sample represents the population at large. Data from samples can provide only an approximation of the true or actual value. The uncertainty associated with the approximation must be considered when reporting estimates or making comparisons. This uncertainty surrounding the estimate, or range of potential true or actual values, depends on several factors: \u2022 the amount of variation in the responses; \u2022 the size of the sample; \u2022 the representativeness of the sample; and \u2022 the size of the subgroup for which the estimate is computed. The magnitude of this uncertainty is measured by the \"standard error\" of an estimate. When statistics from surveys with complex sample designs are reported, the standard error may be calculated for each estimate using balanced repeated replication (BRR) weights. 6 The standard error of the estimate is used in statistical tests to determine the probability that differences between estimates (such as means and percentages) exist. Due to the large sample size in BPS and the large number of planned comparisons, a conservative threshold (p < .01) was established to determine statistical significance. This means the probability that the difference occurred by chance is less than 1 percent. 7 Statistical significance testing supports all statements about differences in this report. When estimates are from a sample, it is important to exercise caution in drawing conclusions about the differences between estimates. Although one estimate may appear to be larger than another, a statistical test may find that the apparent difference between them is not reliably measurable due to the uncertainty around the estimates. In this case, the estimates will be described as having no measurable difference, meaning that the difference between them is not statistically significant. To determine whether differences are statistically significant, this report uses the Wald test at the .01 level when comparing means, and the chi-squared test at the .01 level when comparing proportions. 8 The appearance of a \"!\" symbol (meaning \"interpret data with caution\") in a table or figure indicates that a data cell has a high ratio between the standard error and the point estimate (i.e., the coefficient of variation is greater than or equal to .30 but less than .50); the reader should use caution when interpreting such data. These estimates are still discussed, however, when statistically significant differences are found despite large standard errors. The appearance of a \" \u2021\" symbol (meaning \"reporting standards not met\") indicates a data cell that is suppressed either due to a coefficient of variation that is greater than or equal to .50 or because there are too few respondents to meet reporting standards. The appearance of an asterisk (*) in a table indicates that a group is statistically different from the reference group in italics."}, {"section_title": "Disproportionate Transfer/Coenrollment Rates and the Impact on Data Analysis", "text": "The purpose of this section is to describe how the rate of credit and student movement between institutions can limit data analysis.

The majority of credit transfer opportunities are from public institutions to other public institutions (64 percent). By adjusted level, 9 the largest transfer pattern is vertical, from 2-year to 4-year (37 percent). This is followed by two lateral patterns: (1) 4-year to 4-year (22 percent) and (2) 2-year to 2-year (21 percent). By adjusted sector, most (55.6 percent) credit transfer opportunities come from public 2-year colleges, with 26 percent of all credit transfer opportunities going to public 4-year institutions, 17 percent going to other public 2-year institutions, 8 percent to 4-year private nonprofit institutions, and 4 percent to other institutions (4 percent is not shown in table 3).

As shown in figure 3 and table 3, public 2-year institutions produce the most opportunities for credit transfer to other institutions, with the highest volume of transfers to public 4-year institutions (674,000 potential opportunities for credit transfer) and other public 2-year institutions (446,000 potential transfer opportunities). Altogether, public 2-year institutions make up more than 1.4 million of the 2.6 million potential transfer opportunities to other institutions. Private for-profit institutions constitute a small share of transfer opportunities, with less than 150,000 transfer events. Public 4-year and private nonprofit 4-year institutions make up a large share of credit transfer opportunities to other institutions (683,000 and 310,000, respectively) than the other sector relationships, but they do not approach the volume of public 2-year institutions. The count of actual credits transferred shows a pattern similar to credit transfer opportunities. Figure 4 shows that the volume of credits transferred from public 2-year institutions (19.1 million) 11 exceeds that of all other sectors combined. Even when all other sector relationships are combined (10.9 million credits transferring), the combined transfer credit volume is less than that from public 2-year institutions. The greatest movement of credits, 13.6 million from public 2-year to public 4-year, is statistically different from the other sector combinations. For-profit institutions account for fewer credit transfers than public 2-year institutions, with 126,000 credits transferring out of for-profit 4-year institutions and 175,000 transferring out of profit 2-year institutions. Regardless of control, less-than-2-year institutions had the lowest transfer credit volume.  The uneven distribution across sectors of transfer events and of credits transferred presents some challenges when attempting to better understand the relationship between credit transfer and institutional characteristics. This limitation, and others of note, is described in detail below."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Readers should keep in mind the following limitations when considering the results of this analysis: \u2022 Low sample sizes for some subgroups lead to loss of precision in estimation: Because of the relatively small number of student transfers/coenrollments from certain types of institutions (e.g., for-profit institutions), this analysis cannot examine credit transfer from these types of institutions in as much detail as it does for types of institutions where student transfers are more numerous (e.g., public 2-year institutions). \u2022 Inability to determine why credits do not transfer: Data from this study cannot identify why credits do not transfer. Specifically, transcript data do not show whether credits did not transfer because an institution determined the credits to be irrelevant to the program of study or of unsatisfactory quality, or because a student never informed the institution of previous attendance. The statistical model used in this paper is specifically designed to address this limitation. \u2022 Inability to comprehensively determine which credits come from which institutions: A number of institutions do not itemize credits transferred into the institution, and it is therefore not always possible to identify which credits come from which institutions. This limitation is mitigated because the majority of student who transfer or coenroll do so only once. For students who transfer or coenroll in multiple institutions, this analysis includes only the student's first transfer/coenrollment. Because student transcripts do not consistently identify the origin of transfer credits for students with multiple transfer records, all analyses focus on students' first transfer experiences unless otherwise noted. 12 This restriction allows for the examination of the relationship between credit transfer and the institutional characteristics of the origin and destination institutions. 13 \u2022 Key information not consistently included on transcripts, and therefore unavailable for analysis: Transcripts inconsistently report information that may be of high analytic interest to researchers. Examples include academic factors (e.g., change in major, number of credits earned in high school, etc.), relationship between institutions (e.g., institutional enrollment agreements, articulation agreements, etc.), course attributes/classifications (e.g., honors, capstone, co-op, field work, independent study, internship, research, independent study, vocational, etc.), and academic actions (e.g., academic warning, academic probation, dean's list, honor roll, President's list, Chancellor's list, etc.). See chapter 3 for more information on how this limitation impacts the multivariate analysis. \u2022 Information on student intent to transfer: The analysis cannot determine whether a student who intended to transfer was discouraged from doing so based on misinformation or other reasons and, therefore, made no attempt to do so. \u2022 Transcript data are not imputed: Transcript data are not imputed for item nonresponse as was done for the BPS:04/09 student interview. A missing case analysis was conducted to ensure that cases dropped from the regression analysis are representative of the population. Despite these limitations, this report is able to yield reliable estimates about credit movement for most of the transfer/coenrollment events of first-time beginning undergraduate students. Additionally, this analysis is able to examine many policyrelevant factors that are of high interest to researchers and policymakers related to the transfer of credits between postsecondary institutions. Finally, multivariate statistical techniques are used to account for a student's intent to transfer even though that information was never collected in the student interview. The following sections of this report examine the volume of student and credit transfer, bivariate relationships between student and institutional characteristics on credit transfer, and the joint effects of these characteristics on credit transfer.

While the magnitude of this effect is difficult to quantify, there was at least some evidence to suggest it was not trivial. For example, Cominole et al. (2006) reported that almost 31 percent of students identified by institutions as first-time beginners during sampling for the base year of BPS:04/09 actually had prior postsecondary enrollment. Either these students never informed the sampled NPSAS institution of prior enrollment or these institutions did not have mechanisms in place to capture such information."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Here are key findings from this chapter: \u2022 A large minority of students attended more than one institution. Approximately 65 percent of all postsecondary students attended only one institution, 21 percent transferred once, and an additional 11 percent transferred more than once. \u2022 Of the students who did transfer, approximately 39 percent transferred no credits, 28 percent transferred some credits, and 32 percent transferred all previously earned credits in the first transfer. On average, students lost approximately 13 credits following the first transfer.\nThe descriptive statistics in this chapter demonstrate that multiple factors may contribute to the transfer of credits. These include institutional factors such as institutional level relationship (i.e., transfer direction), institutional control relationship, accreditation status, institutional selectivity relationship, and accreditation relationship. Student factors such as academic performance and changing award/degree programs may also be related to the transfer of credits. The next chapter of this report uses multivariate statistical techniques to examine which factors are associated with credit transfer when considered jointly.\nTwo factors consistently contributed to the likelihood of credit transfer, across both the descriptive statistics and the multivariate model. Controlling for other factors, they are \u2022 academic performance prior to transfer (as measured by GPA); and \u2022 transfer direction (e.g., vertical, reverse, or horizontal). Specifically, higher GPAs were related to lower probabilities that zero credits will transfer and to a higher number of credits accepted. Reverse or horizontal transfer was related to higher probabilities that zero credits will transfer and a lower number of credits accepted at the destination institution. Institutional control was also related to the number of credits transferred. Transferring to for-profit and private nonprofit institutions was related to a lower number of credits transferred compared to transferring to a public institution. Accreditation status was not a factor in the multivariate analysis, nor was there a high volume of students moving between nationally accredited institutions and regionally accredited institutions. Overall, the findings suggest that when student transfer is aligned with how the higher education system is designed to accommodate credit transfer (e.g., from 2-year institution to 4-year institutions), when students perform successfully in their coursework, or when students transfer to a public institution, credit transfer is more likely to occur.

The majority of transfer activity observed in the BPS:04/09 sample was for students transferring from public 2-year institutions. Table 7 summarizes the transfer activity (both potential transfer opportunities and number of credits transferred) and is not limited to the student's first transfer (i.e., it includes all recorded potential transfer opportunities and credit transfers). The 1.4 million potential transfer opportunities and 19.1 million credits transferred from public 2-year institutions were (a) almost triple the volume of student and credit transfers from public 4-year institutions (683,000 transfer opportunities 7.0 million credits transferred); (b) more than five times greater than private nonprofit 4-year (310,000 transfer opportunities; 3.1 million credits transferred); and (c) greater than 10 times all remaining sectors, including for-profit institutions. Because of these disproportionate transfer rates, factors that may influence the transfer of credit (such as the characteristics covered in this chapter) may affect some groups of students more than others. The analysis of institutional sector, for example, should be viewed in light of the relatively high number of student transfers/coenrollments from public 2-year institutions and the low number of student transfers/coenrollments out of for-profit institutions.

Seven groups were formed: \u2022 public institutions to (1) other public institutions, (2) nonprofit institutions, and (3) for-profit institutions; \u2022 nonprofit institutions to (4) public institutions, (5) other nonprofit institutions, and (6) for-profit institutions; and \u2022 because of the small number of students transferring from for-profit institutions, (7) for-profit institutions to any other types of institutions. Two statistical tests were used in this (and subsequent) chapters to explore the relationship between student or institutional characteristics and transfer of credit outcomes. One test examined differences in the percentages of students for whom no credits transferred between their origin and destination institutions, and another test was used to determine if there were differences in the number of credits lost during the first transfer or coenrollment. 14 These variables are consistent with the literature on student transfer, especially about the effect of institutional level on transfer (Bradburn and Hurst 2001;Townsend and Dever 1999;de los Santos and Wright 1990). Institutional characteristics are also explored in other studies when examining other factors such as socioeconomic status, academic preparation, and curricula in the context of institutional characteristics (Cabrera, Burkum, and La Nasa 2005;Freeman, Conley, and Brooks 2006;Goldrick-Rab 2006;Goldrick-Rab and Pfeffer 2009;Li 2010). In addition to the literature, the inclusion of control, selectivity, and accreditation status in this analysis is a result of federal policymakers seeking to identify efficiencies in the credit transfer process regardless of different institutional contexts (GAO 2005). 15 Institutional control is the classification of whether an institution is operated by publicly elected or appointed officials and derives its major source of funds from public sources (public control) or by privately elected or appointed officials and derives its major source of funds from private sources (private control). 4-year public to 2-year public 8.9 63.6* 2-year public to 4-year private nonprofit 9.0 21.2* 4-year private nonprofit to 4-year public 3.9 22.5 4-year public to a 4-year private nonprofit 4.0 31.6 4-year private nonprofit to 2-year public 3.6 68.6 4-year private nonprofit to 4-year private nonprofit 3.0 31.2 Other institution to 4-year private for-profit 3.1 40.3 Other institution to 2-year private for-profit 3.4 88.9 Other institution combination 8.7 75.1 \u2021 Reporting standards not met.

Proportion of students who transferred without credits. Across all institutional control groups, approximately 41 percent of students who transferred had no credits transfer to their destination institution. As shown in table 8, thirty-one percent of students transferring from private nonprofit to other private nonprofit institutions experienced no transfer of credit, while 83 percent of students transferring from private for-profit to all other control groups experienced no transfer of credit. More students transferred or coenrolled without credits transferring when students moved from public to private for-profit institutions and private for-profit to any other type of institution (69 percent and 83 percent respectively) when compared to students moving from public to other public institutions (38 percent). Finally, students moving from public institutions to private nonprofit institutions had a higher proportion of students transferring credits (74 percent; calculated from table 8) compared to students moving from public to public institutions. Number of credits not transferred. On average, students lost 13 credits when transferring institutions. Students transferring from public to other public institutions lost just under one semester of coursework (12 credits), which is close to the average of 13 credits lost. This was fewer credits lost than for students transferring from private nonprofit to public institutions (18 credits). While credit loss for students transferring out of for-profit institutions ranged from 17 to 25 credits, there was no measurable difference when compared with students transferring from public to other public institutions. This is likely due to the large standard errors in the for-profit group. 16 On average, there was no detectable difference with the other institutional control groups and the public to public transfer students, with average credit loss ranging from 14 to 18 credits."}, {"section_title": "Adjusted Institution Level", "text": "To explore the relationship between credit loss and level (i.e., 4-year, 2-year, and lessthan-2-year) of students' origin and destination institutions, five groups representing specific levels of relationship were formed: (1) 4-year to 4-year, (2) 4-year to 2-year, (3) 2-year to 4-year, (4) 2-year to 2-year, and (5) all others (e.g., less-than 2-year to 4-year). 17 As shown in tables 8 and 9, credit transfer varied by institution level in (a) the possibility of credit transfer and (b) the difference between the number of credits earned at the origin institution and those transferred to the destination institution. The transfer pattern from a 2-year to a 4-year institution, the most commonly occurring level relationship, was set as the reference category to which all other relationships were compared. Proportion of students who transferred without credits. All groups were statistically different from the 2-year to 4-year vertical transfer pattern in the proportion of students who transferred without any credits. As table 8 shows, 21 percent of students who transferred from a 2-year institution to a 4-year institution experienced no transfer of credit, compared to 28 percent of students who transferred laterally from a 4-year to another 4-year institution. A larger proportion of students (66 percent) who transferred in the reverse direction (i.e., 4-year to 2-year) lost all their credits in the transfer. Approximately 68 percent of students transferred laterally from one 2-year institution to another without any credits transferring from the first institution. Nearly all students (97 percent) moving to or from less-than-2-year institutions had no credits transferred. Number of credits not transferred. Overall, students transferring or coenrolling vertically from a 2-year to a 4-year institution lost a lower number of credits than all other level groups, except for lateral transfers between 4-year institutions (i.e., 8 and 11 credits). As table 9 shows, eight credits were lost for students who transferred from a 2-year to a 4-year institution, compared with 22 credits for students transferring in the reverse and 15 credits for students transferring from a 2-year to another 2-year institution. There were no measurable differences in the number of credits lost between the students transferring from a 4-year to another 4-year institution with students moving from 2-year to 4-year. Students with a horizontal 4-year transfer lost approximately 11 credits. Evidence in the analysis by level suggests that deviating from a traditional vertical transfer pattern (i.e., 2-year to 4-year)) resulted in a higher likelihood of no credits transferring, and a higher number of credits lost for students who were able to transfer credit. This finding is consistent with a report from the U.S. Department of Education that asserts that purposeful transfers from a community college to a 4-year college or from one 4-year college to another \"were positively associated with degree completion, but wandering from one school to another was not\" (Adelman 2006, p. xxi)."}, {"section_title": "Adjusted Level and Control Combined: Adjusted Institutional Sector", "text": "The preceding chapter provided evidence that the control of students' origin and destination institutions may be related to credit transfer. To determine whether the relationship between credit transfer and adjusted level is consistent across all types of institutional control groupings, students were placed into groups based on the relationship between the sectors of students' origin and destination institutions. As shown in tables 8 and 9, a total of 12 groups were formed (representing adjusted 18 institutional sector): \u2022 2-year public to (1) 4-year public, (2) 2-year public, and (3) 4-year private nonprofit; \u2022 4-year public to (4) 4-year public, (5) 2-year public, and (6) 4-year private nonprofit; \u2022 4-year private nonprofit to (7) 4-year public, (8) 2-year public, and (9) 4-year private nonprofit; \u2022 all institution types to (10) 4-year private for-profit, and (11) 2-year private for-profit; and \u2022 all other combinations (12). As with level and control, table 8 shows that that the proportion of students with \"no credits transferred\" varied by sector relationship. Similarly, table 9 shows a possible relationship between sector and credits lost. Proportion of students who transferred without credits. Table 8 shows that approximately 19 percent of students who transferred vertically from public 2-year to public 4-year experienced no transfer of credit to the destination institution. Consistent with the findings on transfer by adjusted level, the following groups had higher proportions of students without credits transferring compared to students moving vertically from public 2-year to public 4-year institutions: \u2022 reverse transfers from public 4-year to public 2-year (64 percent); \u2022 reverse transfers from private nonprofit 4-year to public 2-year (69 percent); and \u2022 lateral transfers from public 2-year to public 2-year institutions (64 percent). Students transferring horizontally (i.e., 2-year to 2-year or 4-year to 4-year), regardless of control, did not differ from students transferring from 2-year to 4-year institutions. A higher proportion of students transferring to for-profit institutions did so without credits compared to 19 percent in the public 2-year to public 4-year reference group (89 percent to for-profit 2-year and 40 percent to for-profit 4-year). These findings suggest that institutional level, and not control, may drive credit transfer. Number of credits not transferred. As shown in table 9, students who moved from public 2-year to public 2-year institutions had a higher number of credits not transferred (14 credits) compared with students who moved from a 2-year public to a 4-year public (8 credits). For the other sector transfer patterns, students transferring from 2-year to 4-year institutions or 4-year to 4-year institutions lost fewer credits, regardless of institutional control. As shown in table 8, horizontal 4-year to 4-year sectors did not differ from public 2-year to public 4-year student transfers (ranging from 7 to 10 credits lost), but students transferring in reverse had a higher number of credits lost (ranging from 18 to 24 credits)."}, {"section_title": "Accreditation Status", "text": "Accreditation status refers to whether an institution is recognized by a regional accreditor or a national accreditor. 19 Students were categorized based on the accreditation status of the origin and destination institutions in their first transfer or coenrollment.

Among these students, approximately 37 percent had no credits transferring. All the other accreditation relationship groupings (i.e., national to regional, regional to national, and national to national) had a higher proportion of students without credits transferring (all above 80 percent). Number of credits not transferred. Table 11 displays the average number of credits not transferred to the destination institution. On average, students lost almost 13 credits after their first transfer. Students transferring from regionally accredited institutions to other regionally accredited institutions lost an average of 12 credits, while those transferring from a nationally accredited institution to a nationally accredited institution lost an average of 4 more credits, for 16 credits total.

Open admission institutions were formed into a separate category. For nonopen admission institutions, an index was created from two variables: (1) the centile distribution of the percentage of students who were admitted (of those who applied), and (2) the centile distribution of the midpoint between the 25th and 75th percentile SAT/ACT combined scores reported by each institution (ACT scores were converted into SAT equivalents). The two variables were given equal weight for those nonopen admission institutions that had data for both, and the combined centile variable was divided into selectivity categories: very selective, moderately selective, and minimally selective, based on breaks in the distribution. Institutions that did not have test score data were assigned to the selectivity categories using a combination of percentage admitted and whether they required test scores; institutions that did not require test scores were assigned to the minimally selective category, while the remainder were assigned according to the range of centiles of percentage admitted in which they fell.

When examining the number of credits lost, the students transferring/coenrolling from the \"undergraduate courses/no degree program to a bachelor's degree\" program lost the lowest number of credits (4), which is below the overall average of 13 credits (table 12).

This chapter first presents two tables to better understand the joint effect of independent variables on credit transfer by examining the number of credits transferred within each transfer direction or pattern.

This is higher than students who transferred or coenrolled vertically (i.e., from 2-year to 4-year institutions) with 21 percent of students without credits transferring. Among students who transferred or coenrolled to institutions within the same level (i.e., horizontal transfers), 47 percent had no credits transfer. Table 13 shows that the relationship between covariates (such as selectivity, GPA prior to transfer, and change in degree/award level following transfer) and credit transfer depends on transfer direction. For students transferring in the reverse direction, there is no measurable difference in the percentage of students without credits transferring and institutional control, selectivity, GPA, and change in degree/award level, with percentages ranging from 62 to 69 percent. Transferring vertically or horizontally does vary by multiple covariates, including GPA, award level change, and accreditation. The multivariate analysis accounts for the complexity of the variable relationships on credit transfer. Table 14 shows the average number of credits transferred 24 by institutional characteristics and student enrollment characteristics. Overall, the number of credits transferred varied by transfer direction. Students who transferred/coenrolled from 4-year to 2-year institutions (i.e., reverse transfer) transferred the lowest number of credits (18), while students who transferred/coenrolled between institutions at the same level (i.e., horizontal transfer) yielded 24 credits. Transferring or coenrolling from a 2-year to a 4-year yielded the highest number of credits, with 32 credits transferring. 24 This is a different measure from that used in previous tables. Measuring the number of credits lost is ideal for statistical tests because the construction of the variable controls for the effects of the number of credits a student has taken. Otherwise, the length of time a student is enrolled in postsecondary education confounds the other variables because the more credits the student earns, the more credits are available for transfer and the more credits that can be lost. The total number of credits transferred does not control for the length of time a student is enrolled. 1 Overall (reading across the row), the number of credits transferring by transfer direction is statistically different from each other with vertical transfer students having the highest number of credits transferring and reverse transfer students having least.

The dependent variable in the analysis is the total number of credits transferred in the first transfer. Due to missing data from many origin institutions, the number of lost credits (which was presented in chapter 2) was unavailable for the multivariate model. 25 Independent variables of interest include \u2022 transfer direction (vertical, reverse, and horizontal); \u2022 control of origin institution (public, private nonprofit, private for-profit); \u2022 control of destination institution (public, private nonprofit, private for-profit); \u2022 institutional accreditation (regional to regional, regional to national or other, national to regional or other, national to national or other); \u2022 selectivity (to moderately selective or selective versus to not selective or open admissions); \u2022 GPA prior to transfer; and \u2022 number of months enrolled at first institution prior to transfer. 26 The variables included in the model are consistent with the literature on student transfer such as transfer direction (by level) (McCormick 1997(McCormick , 2003Peter and Forrest-Cataldi 2005;Berkner, He, and Cataldi 2002), nontraditional transfer patterns (e.g., reverse transfer and swirling) (Goldrick-Rab 2006; Goldrick-Rab and Pfeffer 2009; Li 2010), GPA (Graham and Dallam 1992;Nolan 1978), accreditation relationship, and institutional control relationship (GAO 2005). Degree/award level 25 The number of credits lost has higher missingness because the missing values from the origin institution are added to the missing values in the destination institution in the computation of the variable. While levels of missingness were low enough to provide bivariate estimates, when combined with missing items generated from the independent variables, they contributed to untenable levels of listwise deletion in the multivariate model. 26 The number of months enrolled at the first institution is included as a control variable to account for the amount of time a student has to earn credits, and therefore the increased pool of credits eligible for potential transfer. change of the academic program was excluded from the model because of the potential to introduce bias from data that are not missing at random because only students who obtained a degree are likely to have a transcripted degree program, resulting in a possible bias in the estimates. The model includes a second set of independent variables to control for risk factors for dropping out or stopping out: \u2022 dependency status (dependent and independent); \u2022 single parent status; \u2022 responsibility for dependents (does not have dependents and has dependents); \u2022 employment status (no job, part time, and full time); \u2022 high school credential (high school diploma and General Education Development [GED]/other diploma); and \u2022 attendance intensity-first year (full time and part time). In addition to risk variables, the model includes student demographic variables: \u2022 race (White, Black/African American, Asian, and all other race groups, including more than one race 27 ); \u2022 ethnicity (non-Hispanic and Hispanic); and \u2022 gender (male and female). The control variables included in the model are consistent with the literature on student access and success. The risk factors, which were identified from previous BPS studies (Horn 1996;Berkner, He, and Cataldi 2002), are indicators of leaving postsecondary education without attaining a degree or credential. The demographic characteristics are identified from the literature on college choice; specifically, this says that students with certain characteristics are less likely to have or obtain the information required to navigate administrative processes such as college applications and financial aid (Perna 2006a(Perna , 2006b). Both sets of variables are included in the model to control for the lack of credit transfer resulting from the student not being able to navigate the administrative process to request a transcript review. These control variables are excluded from the part of the model that examines the review of credits for transfer, as this review is institutionally driven. A summary of the coding of the variables and the reference groups for categorical variables is displayed in table 15. Due to the limitations of the transcript collection, a number of other factors were omitted from the analysis, including but not limited to academic factors (e.g., change in major, 28 number of credits earned in high school) and relationship between institutions (e.g., historically black colleges and universities/Hispanic-servicing institutions [HBCU/HSI] institution status, Carnegie classification, articulation agreements in place, state of institution, and distance between first and second institutions of attendance). Omitting these variables may lead to some unexplained variability in the multivariate model because these variables may explain why credits may or may not transfer. For example, some academic factors, such as changing a program of study, provide institutions with a valid justification for denying the transfer of credit. The proximity of institutions to one another, state regulations, or having articulation agreements in place provide information or standards to allow credits to transfer more easily. Student socioeconomic characteristics or previous academic preparation are latent factors related to student academic performance. Finally, geographic variables may be indicators of a student's familiarity with local institutions. One subset of students-those who transferred to and from less-than-2-year institutions-was removed from the analysis because of the small number of transfers in that sector."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Technique", "text": "As shown in figure 5, the dependent variable (total number of credits transferred) is positively skewed with a high proportion of zero values. This is likely due to two different processes affecting the number of students without credits transferring. Specifically, the zero count in the number of credits transferred is \"inflated\" due to students who never attempted to transfer credit (e.g., the institution never reviewed courses for possible transfer; Equation 1). The \"noninflated\" zeros are those where students made an attempt to transfer credit, but zero credits were transferred. This group should be modeled separately along with students who had credits transfer (Equation 2). Because no data were collected to distinguish between the two groups of students, a statistical technique is required to model the number of zeros needed to account for the second process. The statistical method used to examine dependent variables with this characteristic is Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial regression (ZINB) (Greene 1994;Erdman, Jackson, and Sinko 2008;Long and Freese 2001). The basic assumption of this statistical technique is that the number of zero values is over-represented and that zeros are generated through two distinct processes (similar to what is described above resulting in an excess of zeros). In this case, a logistic regression model, with its own independent variables, is used to model the probability that zero credits transfer due to students who never requested a transcript review versus students who did request credits be transferred, but were denied. The latter group is included in a negative binomial model to describe the number of credits transferred. The first component produces log-odds ratios and the later model yields coefficient estimates in natural log units. A detailed description of the equations used in generating the estimates is available in appendix B. The two components in the ZINB model can have different sets of independent variables to model the two processes. In modeling the transfer of credit, the independent variables in the logistic component of the model, which predicts the probability of students who never attempted to transfer credit (e.g., the institution never reviewed courses for possible transfer), include \u2022 transfer direction (to test if students transferring through the traditional vertical path are more likely to request to transfer credit because the student planned to transfer); \u2022 institutional control of the origin and destination institutions (to test if students attending certain institutions with lower rates of transfer are less likely to request to transfer credit); \u2022 accreditation relationship (to test if students moving from nationally accredited institutions are not requesting to transfer credits presuming they will not because of their previous institution of attendance); \u2022 selectivity relationship (to test if students coming from institutions with lower selectivity are not requesting credit transfer presuming that credits won't be accepted); \u2022 GPA prior to transfer (to test if students with lower GPAs are less likely to request credit transfers); and \u2022 months enrolled prior to transfer (to control for the amount of time elapsed that the student could potentially aggregate credits). Additional control variables were added because Equation 1 is dependent on the behavior of the student who needs to interact with the institution during the credit transfer process. These include dependency status, single parent status, responsibility for dependents, employment status, type of high school credential, attendance intensity in the first year, race, ethnicity, and gender. In the negative binomial component, which predicts the number of credits transferred, the independent variables include \u2022 transfer direction (to test if credits may or may not transfer due to differences in coursework offerings due to changing the level of institution); \u2022 institutional control of the origin and destination institutions (to test if institutions accept transfer credit depending on whether an institution is publicly or privately controlled); \u2022 accreditation relationship (to test if institutions accept transfer credit depending on whether an institution is regionally accredited); \u2022 selectivity relationship (to test if institutions accept transfer credit depending based on their admissions standards, with selective institutions being more discriminating); \u2022 GPA prior to transfer (to control for the academic performance of the student associated with the credits that are transferring); and \u2022 months enrolled prior to transfer (to control for the amount of time elapsed that the student could potentially aggregate credits). Student demographic characteristics are excluded from the negative binomial component of the model because Equation 2 is primarily institutionally driven."}, {"section_title": "Listwise Deletion and Missing Case Analysis", "text": "While variables derived from the BPS:04/09 student interview and administrative records were imputed, the data from the BPS:04/09 transcript file were not imputed. As a result, a missing case analysis was conducted to test for potential bias related to listwise deletion of missing cases from the multivariate model. The analysis revealed no statistical differences between the dropped cases and retained cases in the dependent variable (number of credits transferred). A number of independent variables, however, did reveal some statistical differences with demographic variables (which were imputed) and in dummy variables with a small number of cases. Further analysis did not uncover any evidence that the inferences made in the multivariate model are not reflective of the population. A more detailed description of the analysis can be found in appendix E."}, {"section_title": "Multivariate Findings", "text": "The results of the multivariate analysis are displayed in table 16 with the logit or \"inflated zeros\" coefficient estimates in the first column (which is traditionally not interpreted) 29 and the negative binomial regression coefficients in the second column (modeling the log number of credits transferred). The model as a whole was statistically significant (F = 111.74; p < .001). 30"}, {"section_title": "Factors Predicting the Number of Credits That Transfer", "text": "The negative binomial component of the model explores the relationship between the number of credits students transferred and student and institutional characteristics. Three factors contributed to the number of credits that transferred: \u2022 institutional control; \u2022 transfer direction; and \u2022 GPA. A fourth variable, the number of months enrolled prior to the first transfer, was included as a control and also had a significant statistical relationship. 31 29 The purpose of the logistic component of the model is limited: to obtain estimates of the probability for zero credits to transfer so that information can be used in the negative binomial component. See appendix F for more information. 30 A separate ZINB model including all independent variables in both components yielded consistent results in the statistical tests for the model and the contributions of the independent variables. 31 To ensure that the months enrolled prior to transfer variable was not removing all variability from the model, another analysis without the number of months enrolled prior to transfer was conducted and obtained similar results.  1 Risk factor and demographic variables were omitted from the negative binomial component (which tests for the log number of credits transferred) of the model but were included in the logistic component (which tests for the probability of excess zeros due to factors such as not submitting a transcript for review). This decision was made because there was no evidence in the literature that a possible relationship exists between an institution's decision to transfer credits and type of dependency, single parent status, type of high school degree, enrollment intensity, race, ethnicity, or gender. The variables were included in the logistic component of the model to account for possible relationships between these characteristics and whether or not a transcript review occurs (e.g., submitting transcripts for review, navigating administrative processes). 2 An alternate ZINB model that combined race and ethnicity into one variable (e.g., White non-Hispanic, Black/African American non-Hispanic, Hispanic) yielded identical results. For the institutional control variables, students transferring to private nonprofit and private for-profit institutions were negatively related to the number of credits transferred compared to public institutions. Holding all other variables constant, students transferring to private nonprofit institutions transferred 21 percent fewer credits, on average, than students transferring to public institutions. Students transferring to private for-profit institutions transferred 52 percent fewer credits compared to students sending credits to public institutions. 32 There was no evidence of a relationship between the control of the origin institution and the number of credits transferred. Transfer direction was also related to credit transfer. Students transferring from 4-year to 2-year institutions (reverse transfers) saw 25 percent fewer credits transferred compared to students transferring vertically from 2-year to 4-year institutions. Transferring between institutions at the same level (horizontal) yielded 15 percent fewer credits transferred compared to students transferring vertically. For GPA, a positive relationship was present, with 22 percent more credits transferring for every one-point increase in GPA. The model did not provide evidence of a relationship by change in accreditation or selectivity relationship. To better evaluate the practical use of these findings, table 17 presents the coefficients for the statistically significant variables in terms of semester credit hours for a student with a 3.0 GPA after 12 months of enrollment holding all other factors constant. The coefficients from a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial regression were converted from log credits to credits to evaluate the differences in credit transfer for statistically significant coefficient estimates. The constant represents students transferring vertically (2-year to 4-year) from public to other public institutions-this is set as the reference group, with an average of 23 credits transferring. For students who have a 3.0 GPA, transferring to a private nonprofit institution yields 4 credits less than from public institutions, holding all other factors constant (19 credits versus 23 credits for students vertically transferring from public to public). Transferring to a for-profit yields an estimated 11 fewer credits, holding all other factors constant (12 credits versus 23 credits for students vertically transferring from public to public). Transferring in reverse yields 14 fewer credits and horizontally yields 8 fewer credits (8 credits and 15 credits, respectively versus 23 credits for students vertically transferring from public to public). Because GPA is a continuous variable, figure 6 plots the predicted credit transfer values by GPA. The predicted values in figure 6 were generated by setting all dummy variables to zero in the negative binomial regression equation. Therefore, figure 6 represents students who vertically transfer (2-year to 4-year) between public institutions. As GPA increases, the number of credits transferred increases as well, with an estimated 7 credits transferring near a GPA of zero to 16 credits for a GPA of 2.0. A 3.0 GPA yields a predicted 23 credits, and a 4.0 GPA predicts approximately 31 credits transferred. 0.00 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 3.00 3.50 4.00"}, {"section_title": "Credits transferred", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Grade Point Average", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Categorization I Continuous", "text": "Categorization II 0.00-1.99 2.00-2.99 3.00-4.00 Transcript: Level and control transfer type QGTRTYPE The level and control of the origin and destination institutions.

Each of these tables examines the distribution of nonresponses using frame variables from NPSAS:04 (similar to what was done for the BPS:04/09 methodology report): \u2022 institution sector; \u2022 geographic region; \u2022 CPS record match; \u2022 applied for federal aid; \u2022 Pell grant status in base year; \u2022 Pell grant amount in base year; \u2022 Stafford loan status in base year; \u2022 total Stafford loan amount received in base year; \u2022 institutional undergraduate enrollment from NPSAS institution in base year; \u2022 age at base year; \u2022 high school graduation year; \u2022 dependency status in base year; \u2022 income level in base year; \u2022 race/ethnicity; \u2022 gender; \u2022 marital status in base year; and \u2022 citizenship status in base year. All other PETS:09 variables used in this Statistical Analysis Report had a response rate of 85 percent or higher.            significance of each comparison was determined by calculating the Wald test for the difference between each pair of means or proportions and comparing the F value with published tables of significance levels for two-tailed hypothesis testing. The Wald values were computed to test differences between independent estimates using the following formula: Where Z o is the Wald Statistic (which can be compared to an F distribution; \u03b2 1 and \u03b2 j are estimates; and SE(\u03b2 1 ) is the standard error of \u03b2 1 , which is in the denominator. The test is \"adjusted\" because the standard errors were corrected using Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR) weights. For proportions, a Pearson chi-squared test was computed using the following formula: (2) Where \u03c7 2 is the chi-squared statistic, f o is the observed frequency in a table cell, and f e is the expected frequency in the cell. Chi-square is equal to the sum of the squared difference between the observed frequency (f o ) and the expected frequency (f e ) divided by the expected frequency (f o ). The chi-square, however, does not account for the variance correction procedures to adjust for the complex sampling design. The chi-squared statistic is corrected for the complex survey design using the second-order correction of Rao and Scott (1984). The resulting statistic is an F statistic. There are hazards in reporting statistical tests for each comparison. First, comparisons based on large t statistics may appear to merit special attention. This can be misleading because the magnitude of the t statistic is related not only to the observed differences in means or percentages but also to the number of respondents in the specific categories used for comparison. Hence, a small difference compared across a large number of respondents would produce a large (and thus possibly statistically significant) t statistic. To address this issue, we use variance correction procedures to estimate more accurate standard errors despite the large sample size. A second hazard in reporting statistical tests is the possibility that one can report a \"false positive\" or Type I error. Statistical tests are designed to limit the risk of this type of error using a value denoted by alpha. The alpha level of .01 was selected for findings in this report and ensures that a difference of a certain magnitude or larger would be produced when there was no actual difference between the quantities in the underlying population no more than 1 time out of 100. When a large number of comparisons in a table are tested, Type I errors become more likely. Therefore, the results of multiple comparison tests should be interpreted with caution. In this analysis, comparisons of student transfers from public less-than-2-year institutions were made both overall and also for each of the other six institution sectors (public 4-year, public 2-year, private nonprofit 4-year, private nonprofit less-than-4-year, private for-profit 4-year, and private for-profit less-than-4-year). As the number of simultaneous comparisons increases, the likelihood of a Type I error also increases. The probability of a Type I error for these comparisons taken as a group is larger than the probability for a single comparison. When more than one comparison between groups of related characteristics are tested for statistical significance, one must apply a standard that assures a level of significance for all of those comparisons taken together. This report uses an alpha level of .01 instead of .05 for all statistical tests except for the nonresponse bias analysis noted above. When test hypotheses indicate alpha values at the .01 level or smaller, the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the two quantities is rejected. Failing to reject a null hypothesis, that is, to detect a difference, however, does not imply that the values are the same or equivalent."}, {"section_title": "Multivariate Modeling", "text": "The model used for the analysis of transfer credit was chosen due to some unique characteristics of the dependent variable. The dependent variable, the total number of credits transferred, is positively skewed with a high proportion of zero values. This is likely due to two different processes impacting the number of students with zero credits transferring. Specifically, the zero count in the number of credits transferred is \"inflated\" due to students who never attempted to transfer credit (i.e., the institution never reviewed courses for possible transfer; process #1). The \"noninflated\" zeros are those where students made an attempt to transfer credit, but zero credits were transferred. This group should be modeled separately with students who had credits transfer (process #2). Because no data were collected to distinguish the two groups of students, a statistical technique is required to model for the number of zeros needed to account for the second process. The statistical method used to examine dependent variables with this characteristic is Zero-inflated Negative Binomial regression (ZINB). The basic assumption of this statistical technique is that the number of zero values is overly represented and that these excess zeros are generated through two distinct processes (similar to what is described above). The ZINB regression technique generates estimates for two models simultaneously: (1) a logistic regression model, with its own independent variables, which describes the two processes that lead to zero credits transferred as an outcome (the probability that zero credits transfer, presumably from process #1); and (2) a negative binomial model to describe the number of credits transferred (Erdman, Jackson, and Sinko 2008;Long and Freese 2001). The logistic regression component of the model can be represented by the following equation: where \u03c6 i is the probability that a student with an observed count of zero is in the always zero group (due to process #1 -transfer credits never being reviewed). The independent variables, represented by the vector z i include transfer direction, institutional control of the origin and destination institutions, accreditation relationship, selectivity relationship, grade point average (GPA) prior to transfer, and months enrolled prior to transfer. Additional control variables were added because process #1 is dependent on the behavior of the student, who needs to interact with the institution during the credit transfer process. These include dependency status, single parent status, responsibility for dependents, employment status, type of high school credential, attendance intensity in the first year, race, ethnicity, and gender. The parameter estimates associated with z i are represented by \u03b3. The negative binomial component of the model is represented by the following equation and derives the expected number of credits transferred: where the dependent variable y i is the natural log of the number of credits transferred and x i represents the vector of independent variables; x i can differ from the variables in the logistic function as is the case presented in this transfer of credit model. Independent variables include transfer direction, institutional control of the origin and destination institutions, accreditation relationship, selectivity relationship, GPA prior to transfer, and months enrolled prior to transfer. Student demographic characteristics are excluded from the negative binomial component of the model because process #2 is institutionally driven. The parameter estimates associated with x i are represented by \u03b2. Lambda (\u03bb i ) is a shortened version of the equation. Equation 4 used in the negative binomial component is identical to the Poisson regression equation. ZINB regression differs from the Poisson in the probability of observing a specific count given x i . In Poisson regression, the probability of an observed count of y i conditioned on x i is calculated using the following equation: ZINB on the other hand, models for the probability of an observed count of y i on both the vector x i and the observation not being part of the always zero group due to process #2 (i.e., transfer credits were reviewed). The adjusted equation is as follows: An additional measure of dispersion (represented by \u03b1) and the gamma distribution of error terms associated with \u03b1 (represented by \u0413), relax the assumption that the variance of the dependent variable must equal the mean. When \u03b1 is zero (no dispersion in the dependent variable), Equation 6 becomes the Poisson regression equation (Equation 5 above). For a detailed description of the equations used to derive ZINB estimates, see Greene (1994) and Long and Freese (2001). By distinguishing between zeros produced by two separate data-generating processes, the ZINB model addresses the overdispersion of a distribution as well as a higher number of zeros than would be expected in a normal distribution. Diagnostic tests ensure that distribution of the dependent variable fits the assumptions of the ZINB model, one that tests the null hypothesis that \u03b1 does not equal zero (i.e., that the data are not overly dispersed) and another that tests the null hypothesis that there are not a higher number of zero values than would be expected in a normal negative binomial distribution (i.e., the Vuong test).

In order to test if the results would change, three Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) multivariate analyses were re-run, adding the following interaction terms to the model: \u2022 Model 1: Control of origin institution by student independent status, control of origin institution by students with dependents, and control of origin institution by full-time employment status; \u2022 Model 2: Transfer direction by student independent status, transfer direction by students with dependents, and transfer direction by full-time employment status; and \u2022 Model 3: Accreditation by student independent status, accreditation by students with dependents, and accreditation by full-time employment status. In all cases, the models yielded the same results as the multivariate model, with no statistically significant interaction terms in the negative binomial model. The results suggest that if these missing cases were added back to the model, it would not change the results, and that the inferences to the population are not compromised. The syntax used to generate these models can be found at http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2014163. Students transferring in reverse and horizontally had a higher likelihood of zero credits transferring compared to students transferring vertically. A student who transferred in reverse from a 4-year institution to a 2-year institution had an estimated 323 percent increase 2 in the odds that zero credits transfer compared to students transferring vertically. Students transferring horizontally (2-year to other 2-year or 4-year to other 4-year institutions) had a 144 percent increase in the odds that zero credits transfer. This finding was consistent with the earlier findings that indicated that a higher proportion of students transferred zero credits when they deviated from more traditional transfer patterns (2-year to 4-year institutions). A relationship also existed between GPA and zero credits transferring. Higher GPA values decreased the likelihood of zero credits transferring. Specifically, every one point increase in GPA resulted in a 36 percent decrease in the odds that a student will have no credits transfer. Selectivity was also related to zero credits transferring. Students transferring to a selective or moderately selective institution rather than to an open admissions or minimally selective institution had a lower probability of zero credits transferring with 46 percent lower odds that zero credits transfer compared to open admissions institutions. The model did not uncover any relationship between the likelihood of zero credits transferring and student risk factors (i.e., dependency status, being a single parent, having dependents, employment status, type of high school credential, or first year attendance intensity) or demographic characteristics (i.e., race, ethnicity, or gender)."}]
