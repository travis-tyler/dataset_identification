Given that the majority of Americans under the age of 35 years have never been vaccinated against smallpox and the great majority of those over 35 have not received booster vaccinations since the early 1970s, immunity to smallpox is considered to be low to nonexistent in today's population. In the past, primary vaccination of individuals with vaccinia was believed to confer dependable protection for at least 5 years, with increasing protection achieved with subsequent revaccinations. 1,2 However, a major question posed today is whether those individuals vaccinated 40 or more years ago would be protected in the event of smallpox exposure. This may be a critical question because the availability of smallpox vaccines is limited and currently inadequate for a mass inoculation program. To address this, we evaluated the stability and potency of vaccinia-specific immunity after smallpox vaccination in 209 individual participants in the National Institute on Aging's Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging.

Included in this study was a subset of the total BLSA cohort: all those with a known history of either smallpox infection (n = 8) or documented smallpox vaccinations (n = 209). Also included were 29 nonvaccinated BLSA participants. Of the 209 BLSA participants previously vaccinated, serum samples were available that had been stored for 13 to 88 years (median, 61 years) after the first vaccination. The median number of samples per subject was 4 (range 2-13). All vaccination histories were verified through medical and military records.

The latter group was generally younger, having been born after smallpox vaccination was no longer recommended practice."}, {"section_title": "Vaccinia-Specific Antibody Titers", "text": "Among those individuals with prior vaccination (n = 209), vaccinia-specific IgG titers persisted and remained relatively stable at the various assessed time points, with titers ranging from 1:32 to 1:256 (Ln 3.46-5.54) for periods up to 88 years after an initial vaccine ( Figure 1). Comparison of antiviral antibody IgG titers elicited by additional vaccinations demonstrated a small but statistically significant (P <.05) increase in the mean IgG titer that was produced after 2 or more vaccinations compared with subjects receiving only one vaccination. Additional vaccinations of 3, 4, or 5 inoculations resulted in a further small but significant increase in the IgG maintenance titers out to 88 years after the final vaccine administration (Figure 1). While these IgG titers demonstrate the persistence of vaccinia-reactive antibodies, they do not indicate the antibody's ability to neutralize viral infectivity. To assess viral neutralization by antibody, we used a modified vaccinia neutralization assay. Similar to the IgG titers, the vaccinia-specific neutralizing antibody levels were quite stable after single or multiple vaccinations for up to 88 years ( Figure 2). In the majority of examined samples (124/209, 59%), the NT 50 ranged from 1:256 to 1:512 (Ln 5.55-6.24) and remained stable. Only 3 patients (1.4%) had no measurable neutralizing antibody. Of note, and in contrast to the ELISA findings, there was no significant difference in neutralizing antibody level in those vaccinated once compared with those receiving additional vaccines ( Figure 2). Control non-vaccinated subjects reproducibly yielded NT 50 titers of <1:16 (Ln <2.77), with the majority of samples reproducibly measuring below 1:8 (Ln 2.08). We also assessed the stability of sequential measurements of neutralizing antibody among the 62 subjects who had received only a single vaccination. The median line through the values obtained on these subjects had a small negative slope (\u22120.0003/year) (data not shown), suggesting that even individuals who have had only a single vaccination maintain protective levels of neutralizing antibody indefinitely. Overall, these data document the persistence of vaccinia-specific antibody levels for extended time periods after initial and subsequent vaccinations in nearly all vaccinated donors."}, {"section_title": "Vaccinia-Specific Titers in Smallpox Survivors", "text": "Smallpox infection survivors are known to have lifelong protection from reinfection. 11,12 We expected, therefore, that individuals with history of infection would have higher levels of immunity than those merely vaccinated. However, we found no differences in antivaccinia antibody titers between patients who recovered from smallpox and subjects who were vaccinated one or more times with vaccinia. Subjects with a prior history of smallpox retained vaccinia-specific IgG and neutralization titers similar to those subjects vaccinated one or more times during their lifetime (Figure 3)."}, {"section_title": "Vaccinia-Specific Antibody Titers as a Biomaker of Protection", "text": "With the extinction of naturally occuring smallpox, it may be impossible to definitively establish the immunological correlates of protection against this disease in humans. Based on older data, 11 the 1:32 titer is a reasonable biomarker of protective immunity. Our results demonstrated that >97% of the samples tested exhibited neutralization titers above 1:32 at all time points tested. Less than 1% of the donors demonstrated titers initially above 1:32 that subsequently fell below this cutoff value. Similarly, as subjects previously diagnosed with smallpox possess lifelong protection against the smallpox virus, [11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21] we also have used as a threshold the lowest neutralization titer from the 8 BLSA participants with documented medical histories of smallpox infections. This titer was found to be 1:48. Using this level of neutralizing antibody as a marker for smallpox resistance, we found that 95% of the subjects demonstrated titers above this level for all samples examined."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Our longitudinal study of the durability of immune responses to vaccinia immunization suggests that nearly all individuals who have been vaccinated maintain both specific and neutralizing antivaccinia antibodies at levels that suggest protection against smallpox. Multiple vaccinations produced slightly higher levels of antibody, but levels of antibody do not decrease significantly over time after vaccination. The dogma on smallpox vaccinations has been that individuals with repeated exposure to smallpox (eg, travelers to endemic countries) should be revaccinated every 5 years. [10][11][12] However, several cross-sectional epidemiological studies have suggested that smallpox vaccination provided recipients with protection against lethal smallpox for longer periods of time and that multiple inoculations might not be necessary. 11,[13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21] Our longitudinal data support this argument; a single vaccination elicits functional antibody that remains stable over the lifetime. While the specific roles of humoral and cellular immunity in the long-term protection against smallpox are not completely defined, 2 prospective studies indicate that high levels of neutralizing antibodies may be associated with protective immunity against smallpox. 22,23 One study 22 demonstrated that subjects who were in contact with smallpox victims possessing vaccinia virus neutralizing titers <1:32 were more susceptible to smallpox infection (3 of 15, or 20% of contacts infected) compared with subjects with antibody titers of \u22651:32 (0 of 127 or <1% of contacts infected. In a smaller study, 23 6 of 43 (14%) contacts with neutralizing titers <1:20 contracted smallpox. whereas 0 of 13 contats with titers of 1:20 or higher contracted the disease. Thus, these serum-neutralizing antibody levels might be useful at least as biomarkers of protective immunity, regardless of whether the protection is mediated by humoral or cellular immunity or both. In a study by Hammarlund et al, 24 >90% of volunteers vaccinated between the ages of 25 and 75 years retained substantial humoral or T-cell immunity against vaccinia virus. Antiviral antibody responses were present 1 to 75 years after vaccination, while antivaccinia T-cell responses decreased 8 to 15 years after the last vaccination. Another study found that virus-specific T-cell memory can persist for up to 50 years in the presumed absence of antigen. 25 We similarly observed the maintenance of high levels of circulating antivaccinia antibody at many different time points in an individuals's life span over a 13-to 88-year period. In contrast, studies by Hsieh and coworkers 26 revealed that the longevity of vaccinia-specific T-cell-specific immune memory in a cohort of 220 Taiwanese individuals (aged 18-70 years) was easily detectable in subjects previously vaccinated 23-30 years earlier but more difficult to detect in subjects vaccinated 31-40 years earlier. These findings differ somewhat from the reports where vaccinia-reactive T cells could be detected as long as 50-75 years after vaccination. 24 The reasons for such differences remain unclear. In a more recent study, 27 159 healthy, previously vaccinated adults between the ages of 24 and 52 years were revaccinated; of these, 88% with clinical \"take\" (skin reactivity to vaccine) were found to seroconvert, while subjects with no clinical take demonstrated little to no antibody response. Moreover, the level of preexisting antibodies inversely correlated with the rates of clinical take and sero-conversion with the group of vaccinees with the lowest preexisting levels of antibodies (86%) developing antibody responsese to vaccine challenge. This study also demonstrated that the time since the last vaccination was significantly associated with the rates of clinical take and antibody seroconversion. The longer the interval since the last vaccination, the greater the rate of clinical take and seroconversion. Unfortunately, in our longitudinal study, precise information on clinical take was not retained over the ex-tanded time periods. However, a small cohort of subjects did have such documentation and demonstrated similar antibody maintenance patterns as subjects without such documentation (dada not shown). Individuals who have survived a smallpox infection are thought to maintain lifelong protection; by contrast, vaccination generally induces a response that diminishes over time. Thus, we expected that individuals with a history of infection would have higher levels of immunity than those who were vaccinated. However, we found that vaccinia-specific antibody titers were comparable in these 2 groups (Figure 3). The mechanism of the lifelong persistence of vacciniaelicited smallpox immunity is undefined. The morbidity associated with vaccine administration and the risk of mortality among elderly and immune-compromised populations also are critical factors that will influence a vaccination policy. Little information is available about the safety and efficacy of smallpox vaccines in elderly populations. Furthermore, the aging process is associated with immune response abnormalities. [28][29][30] Development of immunization guidelines for the population will need to consider these factors. Protecting the population against smallpox in the face of limited supplies of vaccine may be a challenge. Frey et al 31 have shown that 1:10 dilutions of the vaccine also are highly efficient at eliciting clinical takes in previously unvaccinated individuals. Our revealed that nearly all the individuals who have been vaccinated one or more times maintained antivaccinia IgG and neutralizing antibody titers above 3 natural logs indefinitely. Titers were stable for up to 88 years. Moreover, those who survived active smallpox infections in their youth retained vaccinia-specific immunity throughout their lives and their antivaccinia antibody titers were similar to the levels of vaccinated subjects. Thus, vaccinated subjects remain immune to vaccinia indefinitely and do not require booster vaccinations even if they are many decades removed from primary vaccination. These data imply that limited supplies of vaccine can be more usefully applied (perhaps in diluted form) to individuals who have never been vaccinated, primarily individuals born after 1972."}, {"section_title": "CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE", "text": "\u2022 Vaccinia elicits antiviral antibody levels and virus neutralizing activity that remain elevated for the life of the patient. \u2022 Multiple vaccinations achieve only marginally higher levels of antibody and virus neutralizing activity than single vaccination. \u2022 Levels of antibodies and virus neutralizing activity are comparable in vaccinated individuals and those who developed smallpox and recovered. \u2022 Vaccinia should be used first on individuals who have never been vaccinated before.
