In this paper, we present a novel method for characterizing networks using the entropy associated with bosonic particles in thermal equilibrium with a heat-bath.

This model is subject to thermal agitation by the heat reservoir. The physics of the system can be captured by using a partition function defined over the normalized Laplacian eigenvalues. Various global thermodynamic characterizations of the network including its entropy and energy then can be computed from the derivative of corresponding partition function with respect to temperature.

For instance, in the application later considered in this paper, graphs provide the activation patterns in fMRI data, which can be indicative of the early onset of Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, kernelmethods on graphs provide emerging and powerful set of tools to determine the class-structure of different graphs. There are many examples in the literature where graph kernels have successfully exploited topological information, and these include the heat diffusion kernel [2] , the random walk kernel [3] , and the shortest path kernel [4] . Once a graph kernel is to hand, it provides a convenient starting point from which machine learning techniques can be applied to learn potentially complex class-structure [5] . Despite the success of existing graph kernels, one of the main challenges that remains open is to capture the variations present in different classes of graph in a probabilistic manner [6] .\nRecently, statistical mechanics and information theory have been used to understand more deeply variations in network structure. One of the successes here has been to use quantum spin statistics to describe the geometries of complex networks [7] . For example, using a physical analogy based on a Bose gas, the phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation has been applied to study the salient aspects network structure [8] . This has been extended to understand processes such as supersymmetry in networks [9] . Although these types of analogy are useful and provide powerful tools for network analysis, they are not easily accommodated into the kernel-based approach to machine learning.\nThe aim in this paper is to bridge this gap in the literature. Our aim is to develop a link between statistical mechanics and kernel methods. To do that we define information theoretic kernels in terms of network entropy. The JensenShannon kernel is computed from the Jensen-Shannon divergence, which is an entropic measure of the similarity between two probability distributions. To compute the divergence, the distribution of data must be characterized in terms of a probability distribution and the associated entropy must be to hand. For graph or network structures, both the probability distribution and the associated entropy can be elusive. To solve this problem, in prior work, they have computed the required entropy using von Neumann entropy (essentially the Shannon entropy of the normalized Laplacian eigenvalues) [5] . Here we aim to explore whether the physical heat bath analogy and Bose-Einstein statistics can be used to furnish the required entropy, and implicitly the underlying probability distribution.\nWe proceed as follows. We commence from a physical analogy in which the normalized Laplacian plays the role as Hamiltonian (energy operator) and the normalized Laplacian eigenvalues are energy states. These states are occupied by bosonic particles (assumed the 0 spin) and the resulting system is in thermodynamic equilibrium with a heat-bath, which is characterized by temperature. The bosons are indistinguishable, and each energy level can accommodate an unlimited number of particles. The effect of the heat bath is to thermalise or randomise the population of energy levels. The occupation of the energy states is therefore governed by Bose-Einstein statistics, and can be characterized using an appropriate partition function. The quantities can be derived from the partition function over the energy states in the network when the system of particles is in thermodynamic equilibrium with the heat bath. From the partition function, we can compute the entropy of the system of particles, and hence compute the Jensen-Shannon kernel. Once the kernel matrix is to hand, we use kernel principle components analysis (kPCA) [10] to embed the graphs into a low dimensional feature space where classification is performed.\nThe remainder of paper is organised as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the preliminaries of graph representation in the statistical mechanical domain. Sections 3 and 4 respectively describe the underpinning concepts of how entropy is computed from the Bose-Einstein partition function, and how the JensenShannon kernel is constructed from the resulting entropy. Section 5 presents our experimental evaluation. Finally, Section 6 provides conclusions and directions for future work."}, {"section_title": "Graph in Quantum Representation", "text": "In this section, we give the preliminaries on the graph representation in quantum domain.

Their approximation allows the cubic complexity of computing the von Neumann entropy from the Laplacian spectrum, to be reduced to one of quadratic complexity using simple edge degree statistics, i.e.\nThis expression for the von Neumann entropy allows the approximate entropy of the network to be efficiently computed and has been shown to be an effective tool for characterizing structural property of networks, with extremal values for cycle and fully connected graphs."}, {"section_title": "Quantum Statistics and Network Entropy", "text": "In this section, we describe the statistical mechanics for particles with quantum spin statistics.

The fMRI signal at each time point is measured in volumetric pixels over the whole brain. The voxels here have been aggregated into larger regions of interest (ROIs), and the blood oxygenation time-series in each region has been averaged, yielding a mean timeseries for each ROI. The correlation between the average time series in different ROIs represents the functional connectivity between regions. We construct the graph using the cross-correlation coefficients for the average time serial pairs of ROIs. To do this we create an undirected edge between two ROI's if the cross-correlation co-efficient between the time series is in the top 40% of values. The threshold is fixed for all the available data, which provides an optimistic bias for constructing graphs. Those ROIs which have missing time series data are discarded.

We compute the Jensen-Shannon kernel matrix using the Bose-Einstein entropy and compare the performance with that obtained from von Neumann entropy. Given the spectra of a graph and the total number of particles, the chemical potential can be derived from Eq.(11), which is used to calculate the entropy. Fig.1 shows the results of mapping the graphs into a 3-dimensional feature space obtained by kernel principal components analysis (kPCA). We use first three eigenvectors to show the cluster of each group. The common feature is that both the Bose-Einstein and von Neumann entropies separate the four groups of subjects.

Since the number of sampling in the datatset is small, we apply the leave-one-out cross-validation and use all the graphs as the testing data. Table 1 summaries the results of classification accuracy obtained by JensenShannon kernels computed from the two entropies. Compared to the accuracy with von Neumann entropy, that obtained with Bose-Einstein entropy exhibits a higher classification accuracy.

"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The main parameters of the Bose-Einstein entropy are the temperature and number of particles in the system. In this section, we discuss the effects of the temperature on the energy level occupation statistics and hence upon the entropic kernel performance at low and high temperatures. We first focus on the average number of particles given the temperature \u03b2 at each energy level \u03b5 i from Eq.(10). In Fig.2(a) , we plot the occupation number for the different normalised Laplacian energy states with different values of temperature. (Fig.2(a) ). Classification accuracy changes with temperature in Jensen-Shannon Divergence with entropy from Bose-Einstein statistics (Fig.2(b) ).\nAs shown in this figure, with fixed temperature and increasing energy, the number of particles in each energy level decreases. As a result the lower energy levels are occupied with the largest number of particles. Furthermore, as the temperature decreasing, the number of particles in each energy state decreases. From Eq.(10), it should be noted that the number of particles in each state is determined by two factors, namely a) the Bose-Einstein occupation statistics, and b) the number of particles as determined by the chemical potential.\nIn order to evaluate how temperature effects the performance of the JensenShannon kernel, we compare its behaviour at low and high temperature. For the fMRI brain activation data, we set \u03b2 = 1 and \u03b2 = 0.1, leaving the total particle number N = 5 unchanged. Compared to the low temperature case (\u03b2 = 10) in Fig.1 , increasing temperature makes the four classes of graphs more densely clus- tered in feature space, shown in Fig.3(a) and Fig.3(b) . This is term which reduces the performance of kernel PCA. Fig.2(b) shows the performance of classification changes with temperature. As the temperature increasing, the occupation number at each energy level increases and particles become to propagate at the high energy states. The probabilities of energy states in the system become identical to each other, reaching the uniform distribution as the temperature approaching to infinite. So all the groups with the same number of states, in statistical perspective, are rather similar to each other at high temperature. This reduces the performance of classification accuracy."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we show how to compute an information theoretic graph-kernel using Bose-Einstein entropy and the Jensen-Shannon divergence.
