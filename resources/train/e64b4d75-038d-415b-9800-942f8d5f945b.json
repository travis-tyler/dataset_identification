Respondents receive detailed definitions to help them determine which expenses to include or exclude from the R&D data they provide. Nevertheless, the statistics presented in this report are subject to response and concept errors caused by differences in the way respondents interpret the definitions of R&D activities and by variations in company accounting procedures. The survey's primary focus is on U.S. industry as a performer of, rather than as a source of funds for, R&D. Thus, data on Federal 'See NSF (1956) and NSF (1960). 'Data obtained in the earlier BLS surveys are not directly comparable with Census figures because of methodological and other differences. support of R&D activities performed by industry are collected, and the resulting statistics appear in several tables while statistics on industrial funding of R&D undertaken at universities and colleges and other nonprofit organizations are not collected or included.' The result of collecting and publishing performer-reported statistics is that the federally funded R&D performance totals presented in this report differ from the totals reported by the Federal agencies that provide the funds and the statistics published in NSF's Federal Funds for Research and Development report series. One reason for these differences is that performers of R&D often expend Federal funds in a year other than the one in which the Federal Government provides authorization, obligations, or outlays.4 During the past several years, the differences have widened between the Federal R&D funding reported by performers and that reported by funding agencies. These differences are documented and analyzed in the latest edition in NSF's National Patterns of R&D Resources report series. The content of the Survey of Industrial Research and Development has been expanded and refined over the years in response to an increasing need by policymakers for more detailed information on the nation's R&D effort. For example, questions on energy R&D were added in the early 1970s, following the oil shortage crisis. On the other hand, collection of certain data items has been eliminated in recent years in an attempt to alleviate some of the burden on respondents. For large firms known to perform R&D, a detailed survey form (Form RD-1) is used to collect data. To limit the reporting burden on small R&D performers and firms included in the sample for the first time, an abbreviated survey form (Form RD-1A), which collects only the most crucial data, is used. Several changes have been made to the survey since the early 1990s that are of special importance to users of this report. Prior to the 1992 survey, statistics were based on samples selected at irregular intervals (i.e., 1967, 1971, 1976, 1981, and 1987). In intervening years, a subset of the last sample, a panel, was used. The most recent sample before the 1992 survey was selected and first used for survey year 1987. Original Also beginning with the 1992 survey, the sample size was increased from approximately 14,000 to approximately 25,000 firms. Annual sampling and the increase in sample size were instituted for several reasons: (1) to account better for births of R&Dperforming establishments in the survey universe; (2) to survey more fully and accurately R&D performed by nonmanufacturing firms, especially in the service sector; and (3) to gather more current information about potential R&D performers. Prior to the 1994 survey cycle, all companies that spent more than $1 million annually on R&D in the United States or had 1,000 or more employees received a survey form every year. Beginning with the 1994 cycle, the employee cutoff was dropped from the criteria and, beginning with the 1996 cycle, the R&D level was raised to $5 million, where it has remained for subsequent surveys. For all cycles of the survey, the remaining firms (i.e., those that were not considered \"certainties\" because of the selection criteria) were subjected to probability sampling and may or may not receive a survey form for a given year. Among the organizations purposely excluded from the survey were trade associations and not-for-profit industrial consortia. Although their primary mission is to serve industry, these associations were excluded because they are nonprofit organizations. Industry statistics in this report were developed from data collected from individual companies.' Since the survey is company-based rather than establishmentbased, all data collected for the various components of each company (plants, divisions, or subdivisions) were tabulated in the company's major industrial classification, which was based on payro11.6 The resulting industry estimates were estimated by summing the data for companies classified within each major industry classification. National totals were then estimated by summing the industry estimates. Beginning with the 1999 survey, a company's major industrial classification was"}, {"section_title": "TABLE NOTES", "text": "These notes pertain to the tables in this section and in section B except as noted in footnotes and other explanatory information noted at the end of specific tables."}, {"section_title": "COMPANY SIZE", "text": "Companies were categorized by total number of domestic employees. See section B, \"Comparability of Statistics,\" for information on how this expanded array of company size classes compare to size classes used in previous reports. The following are the size classes used in this report: 5 to 24 employees; 25 to 49 employees; 50 to 249 employees; 250 to 499 employees; 500 to 999 employees; 1,000 to 4,999 employees; 5,000 to 9,999 employees; 10,000 to 24,999 employees; and 25,000 or more employees. The survey excludes companies with fewer than 5 employees to limit burden on small business enterprises in compliance with the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) guidelines for Federal Government agencies. To reduce the variability in the statistics that can be attributed to the random year-to-year selection of small companies by industry and the high sampling weights that sometimes are assigned to them, the frame from which the statistical sample was selected was divided into two partitions based on total company employment. In the manufacturing sector companies with employment of50 or more and in the non-manufacturing sector companies with employment of 15 or more were included in the large company partition. Companies in the respective sectors with employment below these values (but with at least 5 employees) were included in the small company partition. Because of this, detailed industry statistics were possible only from the large company partition; detailed industry statistics from the small company partition were not possible.

Assignment below the 4-digit level was not done because of the concentration of R&D in relatively few industries and disclosure concerns (see below for detailed discussions of both issues).

To limit the growth occurring each year in the number of certainty cases within the total sample, the certainty criterion was raised for the 1996 survey from $1 million to $5 million in total R&D expenditures based on data gathered from the 1995 survey. With a fixed total sample size, there was concern that the representation of the very large noncertainty universe by a smaller sample each year would be inadequate. Before 1994, companies with 1,000 or more employees had been selected with certainty, but it was observed that the level of spending varied considerably and that many of these companies reported no R&D expenditures each year. For these reasons, it was determined that these companies should be given chances of selection based upon the size of their R&D spending if they were in the previous survey or upon an estimated R&D value if they were not. Consequently, the size criterion based on the number of employees was dropped for surveys after 1994."}, {"section_title": "FRAIVIE PARTITIONING", "text": "Partitioning of the frame for noncertainty companies into large and small companies was first introduced in 1994 because of concern arising from a study of 1992 survey results, which showed that a disproportionate number of small companies was being selected for the sample, and often assigned very large weights. These small companies seldom reported R&D activity. This disproportion was a result of the minimum probability rule (see \"Sample Size\" below) used as part of the independent probability proportionate to size (pps) sampling procedure employed exclusively prior to 1994 (pps is discussed in detail later under \"Sample Selection\"). This rule increased the probabilities of selection for several hundred thousand smaller companies. For the 1994 and subsequent surveys, simple random sampling (srs) was applied to the small company partition causing the smaller companies to be sampled more efficiently than with independent pps sampling since there was little variability in their size (srs is discussed in detail later under \"Sample Selection\"). The large company partition continued to be sampled using independent pps sampling. In 1994 and 1995, total company p*oll was the basis for partitioning the noncertainty frame. For each industry grouping, the largest companies representing the top 90 percent of the total payroll for the industry grouping was included in the pps frame. The balance, the smaller companies comprising the remaining ICI percent of payroll for the industry grouping, was included in the srs frame. Beginning in 1996, total company employment became the basis for partitioning the frame. The total company employment levels defining the partitions were based on the relative contribution to total R&D expenditures of companies in different employment size groups in both the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sectors. In the manufacturing sector, all companies with total employment of 50 or more were included in the large company partition. In the nonmanufacturing sector, all companies with total employment of 15 or more were included in the large company partition. Companies in the respective sectors with employment below these values were included in the small company partition. In the 1999 survey, the large company partition contained almost 610,000 companies and the small company partition contained approximately 1.25 million companies. These counts were comparable to those in the 1998 survey (550,000 and 1.3 million, respectively)."}, {"section_title": "IDENTIFYING \"ZERO\" INDUSTRIES", "text": "One final modification in the frame development for 1996, which was repeated for the 1997 and 1998 surveys, was the designation of \"zero\" industries in the large company partition.

These industries remained within the scope of the survey, but only a limited sample was drawn from them because it was unlikely that these industries conducted R&D. Simple random sampling was used to control the number of companies selected from these industries. For the 1999 survey, no zero industries were defined because this was the first year NAICS was used. For the next several cycles of the survey, NAICS industries will be evaluated to ascertain if any of them should be designated \"zero\" industries."}, {"section_title": "SAMPLE SELECTION", "text": "Beginning with the 1996 cycle of the survey, a significant revision in the procedure for selecting samples from the partitions led to a change in the development and presentation of estimates. The revised procedure was repeated for subsequent surveys. For the 1995 survey, the sample of companies from the large company partition was selected using probability proportionate to size sampling (see below) in each of the 40 strata (discussed previously under \"Defining Sampling Strata\"). Likewise, the simple random sampling of the small company partition was done for each of the 40 strata. However, beginning in 1996, the number of strata established for the small company partition was reduced to two. One stratum consisted of small companies classified in manufacturing industries and the second stratum consisted of small companies classified in nonmanufacturing industries. Simple random sampling continued as the selection method for these two strata. The purpose of selecting the small company panel from these two strata was to reduce the variability in industry estimates largely attributed to the random yearto-year selection of small companies by industry and the high sampling weights that sometimes occurred. As a consequence of this change, estimates for industry groups within manufacturing and nonmanufacturing were not possible from these two strata as noted on affected tables. The statistics for the detailed industry groups were based only on the sample from the large company partition. Estimates from the small company partition were included in statistics for total manufacturing, total nonmanufacturing, and all industries. For completeness, in the affected tables for 1996-98 the estimates also were added to the categories \"other manufacturing\" and \"other nonmanufacturing.\" For 1999 the estimates are published separately in the \"small manufacturing companies\" and \"small nonmanufacturing companies\" categories."}, {"section_title": "PROBABILITY PROPORTIONATE TO SIZE", "text": "Imputing R&D. It would be ideal if company size could be determined by its R&D expenditures. Unfortunately, except for the companies that were in a previous survey or for which there is information from external sources, it is impossible to know the R&D expenditures for every firm in the universe (i.e., R&D information is not available from the Standard Statistical Establishment List (SSEL)). Consequently, the probability of selection for most companies is based on estimated R&D expenditures. Since total payroll is known for each company in the universe (i.e., payroll information is available from the SSEL), it is possible to estimate R&D from payroll using relationships derived from previous survey data. Imputation factors relating these two variables are derived for each industry grouping. To impute R&D for a given company, the imputation factors are applied to the company payroll in each industry grouping. A final measure is obtained by adding the industry grouping components. The effect, in general, is to give firms with large payrolls higher probabilities of selection in agreement with the assumption that larger companies are more likely to perform R&D. Estimated R&D values are computed for companies in the small company partition as well. The aggregate of reported and estimated R&D from each company in both the large and small company partitions represent a total universe measure of the previous year's R&D expenditures. However, assigning R&D to every company results in an overstatement of this measure. To adjust for the overstatement, the universe measure is scaled down using factors developed from the relationship between the frame measure of the prior year's R&D and the final prioryear survey estimates. These factors, computed at levels corresponding to published industry levels, are used to adjust the originally imputed R&D values so that the new frame total for R&D at these levels approximates the prior year's published values. This adjustment provides for better allocation of the sample among these levels. For 1999, the distribution of companies by payroll and estimated R&D in the large company partition was skewed as in earlier frames (i.e., the correlation of payroll and R&D was high because R&D had been estimated based on payroll). Because of this skewness, pps sampling remained the appropriate selection technique for this group. (Had there been a zero-industry stratum in the 1999 sample, it would have been sampled as discussed previously under \"Identifying \"Zero\" Industries\"). That is, large companies had higher probabilities of selection than did small companies. However, a different approach to pps sampling was introduced beginning with the 1998 survey. Historically, pps sampling had been accomplished using an independent sampling methodology, i.e., the selection (or nonselection) of a given company was independent of the sampling result (select or nonselect) of any other company. This implied that over repeated samplings in a given stratum, different size samples would result."}, {"section_title": "9 1", "text": "This added more variability to the sample estimates. For 1998, a fixed sample size pps method was introduced. This method ensured that the sample size desired for a given stratum was achieved, thus eliminating error because of sample size variation from the sample estimates.

The fixed sample size methodology was repeated for the 1999 survey."}, {"section_title": "SIMPLE RANDOM SAMPLING", "text": "As described earlier, only two major strata were defined for samples in the small company partition, manufacturing and nonmanufacturing. The use of srs implied that each company within a stratum had an equal probability of selection. The total sample allocated to the small company partition was dependent upon the total sample specified for the survey and upon the total sample necessary to satisfy criteria established for the large partition. Once determined, the allocation of this total by stratum was made proportionate to the stratum's payroll contribution to the entire partition."}, {"section_title": "SAMPLE STRATIFICATION AND RELATIVE", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "STANDARD ERROR CONSTRAINTS", "text": "The particular sample selected was one of a large number of samples of the same type and size that by chance might have been selected. Statistics resulting from the different samples would differ somewhat from each other. These differences are represented by estimates of sampling error or variance. The smaller the sampling error, the more precise the statistic. Controlling Sampling Error. Historically, it has been difficult to achieve control over the sampling error of survey estimates. Efforts were confined to controlling the amount of error due to sample size variation, but this was only one component of the overall sampling error. The other component depended on the correlation between the data from the sampling frame used to assign probabilities (namely R&D values either imputed or reported in the previous survey) and the actual current year reported data. The nature of R&D is such that these correlations could not be predicted with any reliability. Consequently, precise controls on overall sampling error were difficult to achieve. For recent surveys, primary concern was placed on controlling error for the large company partition since nearly all of the R&D activity was identified from that portion of the sample. For the 1998 and 1999 surveys, with the introduction of the fixed sample size sampling procedure, the component of sampling error due to sample size variation was eliminated. However, the amount of error attributable to the remaining component of the sample remained. Since there was still no way to predict how well the data from the sampling frame would correlate with actual survey data, the approach taken to allocate the sample across the various strata was to assign probabilities in the same manner as in the past when independent sampling was used. The probabilities resulting from this allocation technique determined the sample sizes to be selected from each stratum subject to the overall sample size Constraint dictated by the survey budget. Although the actual survey sampling errors could not be predicted, the parameters used to assign probabilities, and the use of the minimum probability rule resulted in a desirable number of companies being sampled from the lrge company partition (see \"Sample Size\" below)."}, {"section_title": "Sampling Strata and Standard Error Estimates.", "text": "A limitation of the sample allocation procesS for the large company partition should be noted. The Constraints used to control the sample size in each stratum were based on a universe total that, in large part, was improvised. That is, as previously noted, an R&D value was assigned to every company in the frame, even though most of these companies actually may not have had R&D expenditures. The value assigned was imputed for the majority of companies in the frame and, as a consequence, the estimated universe total and the distribution of individual company values, even after scaling, did not necessarily reflect the true distribution. Assignment of sampling probability was nevertheless based on this distribution. The presumption was that actual variation in the sample design would be less than that estimated, because many of the sampled companies have true R&D values of zero, not the widely varying values that were imputed using total payroll as a predictor of R&D. Previous sample selections indicate that in general this presumption held, but exceptions have occurred when companies with large sampling weights have reported large amounts of R&D spending. See table B-2 for a list by industry of the Standard error estimates for selected items and table B-3 for a list of the standard error estimates of total R&D by state. Nonsampling Error. In addition to sampling error, estimates are subject to nonsampling error. Errors are grouped in five categories: specification, coverage, response, nonresponse, and processing. For detailed discussions on the sources, control, and measurement of each of these types of error, see U.S. Bureau of the Census (1994b and 1994f)."}, {"section_title": "SAMPLE SIZE", "text": "The parameters set to control sampling error discussed above resulted in a sample size of 18,529 companies from the large company partition. For the small company partition, two strata (manufacturing and nonmanufacturing) were identified. Also included was a separate stratum of small companies that could not be classified into a NAICS industry because of incomplete industry identification in the SSEL. In 1999, as in the 1994 through 1998 surveys, a small number of companies was selected from this group in the hope that an accurate industry identification could be obtained at a later point. Ultimately, a final sample of 5,902 companies was selected from the small company partition. The sample initially allocated to the two strata was proportionate to its share of total payroll for the small company partition. The total sample size finally determined for the 1999 survey' was 24,431. This total included an adjustment to the sample size based on a minimum probability rule and changes in the operational status of some companies. With the use of fixed sample size pps sampling for the large company partition and simple random sampling for the small company partition (and with no zero-industry stratum for 1999), the target sample size was met. Minimum Probability Rule. A minimum probability rule was imposed for both partitions. As noted earlier, for the large paftition, probabilities of selection proportionate to size were assigned to each company, where size was the reported or imputed R&D value assigned to each company. Selected companies received a sample weight which was the inverse of their probability. Selected companies that ultimately report R&D expenditures vastly larger than their assigned values can have adverse effects on the statistics, which were based on the weighted value of survey responses. To lessen the effects on the final statistics, the maximum weight of a company was controlled by specifying a minimum probability that could be assigned to the company. If the probability, based on company size, was less than the minimum probability, then it was reset to this minimum value. The consequence of raising these original probabilities to the minimum probability was to raise the sample size. Similarly, a maximum weight for each stratum was established for the simple random sampling of the small company partition. If the sample size initially allocated , 127 to a stratum resulted in a stratum weight above this maximum value, then the sample size was increased until the maximum weight was achieved. Changes in Operational Status. Between the time that the frame was created and the survey was prepared for mailing, the operational status of some companies changed. That is, they were merged with or acquired by another company, or they were no longer in business. Before preparing the survey for mailing, the operational status was updated to identify these changes.

Specific rules govern imputation for missing data depending on the item being imputed. For some items (domestic sales, total employment, total R&D, and number of research scientists and engineers) missing current year data are always imputed. Rates of change are applied to prior year data regardless of whether prior year data were reported or imputed. For other items (e.g., basic research, subcontracted R&D, and foreign R&D) missing current year data are imputed only if the company reported the item in either of the prior two years. A third type of imputation occurs when detail does not sum to the total (e.g. Federal R&D by agency). In this case if prior year detail is not imputed, then current year data are distributed based on the previous distribution pattern of the reporting unit. Otherwise, an industry average distribution is applied to the total to derive a value for each detailed item. Rates of change are calculated by item within each NAICS category or industry. The calculations are based on weighted data for all companies that reported both variables.

The general imputation procedure described above became increasingly dependent upon information imputed in prior years, thereby distancing current year estimates from any reported information. Because of the increasing dependence on imputed data, NSF chose not to publish character of work estimates in 1986. The imputation procedure used to develop these estimates was revised in 1987 for use with later data and differs from the general imputation approach. The new method calculated the character of work distribution \"For detailed descriptions and analyses of the imputation methods and algorithms used, see U.S. Bureau of the Census (1994c)."}, {"section_title": "195", "text": "for a nonresponding firm only if that firm reported a distribution within a 5-year period, extending from 2 years before to 2 years after the year requiring imputation. Imputation for a given year was initially performed in the year the data were collected and was based on a character of work distribution reported in either of the 2 previous years, if any. It was again performed using new data collected in the next 2 years. If reported data followed no previously imputed or reported data, previous period estimates were inserted based on the currently reported information. Similarly, if reported data did not follow 2 years of imputed data, the 2 years of previously imputed data were removed. Thus, character of work estimates were revised as newly reported information became available and were not final for 2 years following their initial publication. Beginning with 1995, previously estimated values were not removed for firms that did not report in the third year, nor were estimates made for the 2 previous years for firms reporting after 2 years of nonresponse. This process was changed because, in the prior period, revisions were minimal. Estimates continued to be made for 2 consecutive years of nonresponse and discontinued if the firm did not report character of work in the third year. If no reported data were available for a firm, character of work estimates were not imputed. As a consequence, only a portion of the total estimated R&D expenditures were distributed at the firm level. Those expenditures not meeting the requirements of the new imputation methodology were placed in a \"not distributed\" category. Table B-7 shows the character of work estimates along with the \"not distributed\" component for 1999. NSF's objective in conducting the survey has always been to provide estimates for the entire population of firms performing R&D in the United States. However, the revised imputation procedure would no longer produce such estimates because of the \"not distributed\" component. A baseline estimation method thus was developed to allocate the \"not distributed\" amounts among the character of work components. In the baseline estimation method, the \"not distributed\" expenditures were allocated by industry group to basic research, applied research, and development categories using the percentage splits in the distributed category for that industry. The allocation was done at the lowest level of published industry detail only; higher levels were derived by aggregation, just as national totals were derived by aggregation of individual industry estimates, and result in higher performance shares for basic and applied research and lower estimates for development's share than would have been calculated using the previous method.

The original 6 categories were expanded to 10 to emphasize the role of small companies in R&D performance. During 1998, companies with fewer than 500 employees spent $30.2 billion on industrial R&D performed in the United States. During 1999, they spent $34.1 billion (NSF 2001a). Of this amount, 21 percent ($7.0 billion) was spent by the smallest companies (those with at least 5 but fewer than 25 employees). The 1999 statistics further show that there was more growth in the amount of R&D performed by smaller companies than in the amount performed by larger companies. The more detailed business size information also facilitates better international comparisons. Generally, statistics produced by foreign countries that measure their industrial R&D enterprise are reported with more detailed company size classifications at the lower end of the scale than U.S. Changes to reported data can come from three sources: respondents, analysts involved in survey and statistical processing, and the industry reclassification process. Prior to 1995, routine revisions were made to prior year statistics based on information from all three sources. Consequently, results from the current year survey were used not only to develop current year statistics, but also to revise immediate prior year statistics. Beginning with the 1995 survey, this practice was discontinued. The reasons for discontinuation of this practice were annual sampling, continual strengthening of sampling methodology, and improvements in data verification, processing, and nonresponse follow-up. Moreover, it was not clear that respondents or those who processed the survey results had any better information a year after the data were first reported. Thus, it was determined that routinely revising published survey statistics increased the potential for error and often confused users of the statistics.

Prior to annual sampling, a wedging operation which was performed when a new sample was selectedwas a means of adjusting the data series to account for the changes in classification that occurred in the frame (see the discussion on wedging later under \"Time Series Analyses\"). Second, yearly correlation of R&D data is lost when independent samples are drawn each year."}, {"section_title": "INDUSTRY SHIFTS", "text": "The industry classification of companies is redefined each year with the creation of the sampling frame. By redefining the frame, the sample reflects current distributions of companies by size and industry. A company may move from one industry to another because of either changes in its payroll composition, which is used to determine the industry classification code (see previous discussion under \"Frame Creation\"); changes in the industry classification system itself; or changes in the way the industry classification code was assigned or revised during survey processing. A company's payroll composition can change because of the growth or decline of product or service lines, the merger of two or more companies, the acquisition of one company by another, divestitures, or the formation of conglomerates. Although an unlikely occurrence, a company's industry designation could be reclassified yearly with the introduction of annual sampling. The result is that a downward movement in R&D expenditures in one industry is balanced by an upward movement in another industry from one year to the next. Since the last major revision of the SIC system was in 1987, this revision was used to classify companies in the 1992-98 surveys. As discussed above, the industrial classification system has been completely changed and, beginning with the 1999 cycle of the survey, the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) is now used. The method used to classify firms during survey processing was revised slightly in 1992.

For example, a sample of about 14,000 firms was selected for the 1987 survey. For the 1988-91 studies, about 1,700 of these firms were resurveyed annually; the other firms did not receive survey forms, and their R&D data were estimated. This sample design was adequate during the survey's early years because R&D performance was concentrated in relatively few manufacturing industries. However, as more and more firms began entering the R&D arena, the old sample design proved increasingly deficient because it did not capture births of new R&Dperforming firms. The entry of fledgling R&D performers into the marketplace was completely missed during panel years. Additionally, beginning in the early 1970s, the need for more detailed R&D information for nonmanufacturing industries was recognized. At that time, the broad industry classifications \"miscellaneous business services\" and \"miscellaneous services\" were added to the list of industry groups for which statistics were published. By 1975, about 3 percent of total R&D was performed by firms in nonmanufacturing industries. During the mid-1980s, there was evidence that a significant amount of R&D was being conducted by an increasing number of nonmanufacturing firms; again, the number of industries used to develop the statistics for nonmanufacturers was increased. Consequently, \"See also NSF (1994, 1995, and 1996a). \"Until 1967, samples were selected every 5 years. Subsequent samples were selected for 1971, 1976, 1981, and 1987. testing, computer programming, and data processing service industries; hospitals; and medical labs. Approximately 9 percent of the estimated industrial R&D performance during 1987 was undertaken by nonmanufacturing fimis. After the list of industries for which statistics were published was expanded, it became clear that the sample design itself should be changed to reflect the widening population of R&D performers among firms in the nonmanufacturing industries\" and small firms in all industries so as to account better for births of R&Dperforming firms and to produce more reliable statistics. Beginning with the 1992 survey, NSF decided to (1) draw new samples with broader coverage annually, and (2) increase the sample size to approximately 25,000 firms.3' As a result of the sample redesign, for 1992 the reported nonmanufacturing share was (and has continued to be) 25-30 percent of total R&D.\""}, {"section_title": "TIME-SERIES ANALYSES", "text": "The statistics resulting from this survey on R&D spending and personnel are often used as if they were prepared using the same collection, processing, and tabulation methods over time. Such uniformity has not been the case. Since the survey was first fielded, improvements have been made to increase the reliability \"For the 1992 survey, 25 new nonmanufacturing industry and industry groups were added to the sample frame: agricultural services (SIC 07); fishing, hunting, and trapping (SIC 09); wholesale trade nondurables (SIC 51); stationery and office supply stores (SIC 5112); industrial and personal service paper (SIC 5113); groceries and related products (SIC 514); chemicals and allied products (SIC 516); miscellaneous nondurable goods (SIC 519); home furniture, furnishings, and equipment stores (SIC 57); radio, TV, consumer electronics, and music stores (SIC 573); eating and drinking places (SIC 581); miscellaneous retail (59); nonstore retailers (SIC 596); real estate (SIC 65); holding and other investment offices (SIC 67); hotels, rooming houses, camps, and other lodging places (SIC 70); automotive repair, services, and parking (SIC 75); miscellaneous repair services (SIC 76); amusement and recreation services ( of the statistics and to make the survey results more useful. To that end, past practices have been changed and new procedures instituted. Preservation of the comparability of the statistics has, however, been an important consideration in making these improvements. Nonetheless, changes to survey definitions, the industry classification system, and the procedure used to assign industry codes to multi-establishment companies have had some,. though not substantial, effects on the comparability of statistics.\" The aspect of the survey that had the greatest effect on comparability was the selection of samples at irregular intervals (i.e., 1967, 1971, 1976, 1981, 1987, and 1992) and the use of a subset or panel of the last sample drawn to develop statistics for intervening years. As discussed earlier, this practice introduced cyclical deterioration of the statistics. As compensation for this deterioration, periodic revisions were made to the statistics produced from the panels surveyed between sample years. Early in the survey's history, various methods were used to make these revisions.34 After 1976 and until the 1992 advent of annual sampling, a linking procedure called wedging was used.\" In wedging, the 2 sample years on each end of a series of \"For discussions of each of these changes, see U.S. Bureau of the Census (1994g); for considerations of comparability, see U.S. Bureau of the Census (1994e and 1993). \"The process was dubbed wedging because of the wedgelike area produced on a graph that compares originally reported statistics with the revised statistics that resulted after linking. estimates served as benchmarks in the algorithms used to adjust the estimates for the intervening years.\" COMPARISONS TO OTHER STATISTICAL SERIES NSF collects data on federally financed R&D from both Federal funding agenciesusing the Survey .of \"For a full discussion of the mathematical algorithm used for the wedging process that linked statistics from the 1992 survey with those from the 1987 survey, see U.S. Bureau of the Census and is more fully representative of the current universe (the prior panel suffers from panel deterioration, especially a lack of birth updating). The limitations in the prior panel caused by these factors are naturally assumed to increase with time, so that in the revised series, we desire a gradual increase in the level or revision over time which culminates in the real difference observed between the two independent sample estimates of the prior year. At the same time, we desire that the annual movement of the original series be preserved to the degree possible in the revised series (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1994). To that end, the wedging algorithm does not change estimates from sample years and adjusts estimates from panel years, recognizing that deterioration of the panel is progressive over time. One of the primary reasons for deciding to select a new sample annually rather than at irregular intervals was to avoid applying global revision processes such as wedging. Consequently, the 1992 survey was intended to be the last one affected by the wedging procedure.

As reported by Federal agencies, NSF publishes data on Federal R&D budget authority and outlays, in addition to Federal obligations. These terms are defined below:\" Budget authority is the primary source of legal authorization to enter into financial obligations that will result in outlays. Budget authority most commonly is granted in the form of appropriations laws enacted by Congress with the approval of the president (NSF 2001b). Obligations represent the amounts for orders placed, contracts awarded, services received, and similar transactions during a given period, regardless of when the funds were appropriated or when future payment of money is required. Outlays represent the amounts for checks issued and cash payments made during a given period, regardless of when the funds were appropriated or obligated. \"See also NSF (2000a). National R&D expenditure totals in NSF's National Patterns of R&D Resources report series are primarily constructed with data reported by performers and include estimates of Federal R&D funding to these sectors. But until performer-reported survey data on Federal R&D expenditures are available from industry and academia, data collected from the Federal agency funders of R&D were used to project R&D performance. When survey data from the performers subsequently are tabulated, as they were for this report, these statistics replace the pro- have reported significant declines in Federal R&D support since 1990 (see table A-1), while Federal agencies have reported level or slightly increased funding of industrial R&D (NSF 1999a).
