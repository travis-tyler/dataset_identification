Patterns of change with age are incompletely documented. METHODS: Adults aged 18-92 years in the Scottish and English Health Surveys of 1994-96 and 2008-10 were divided into fifteen 5-year age bands. Sex-specific prevalences of overweight/obesity and of increased/high waist circumference against age were compared using analysis of covariance. RESULTS: Data available for 7932 Scottish and 55 925 English subjects in 1994-96, and for 27 391 Scottish and 30 929 English in 2008-10, showed generally similar patterns of change in the two countries. Prevalences of both elevated BMI and waist circumference rose with age for longer in 2008-10 than in 1994-96, reaching higher peaks at greater ages, particularly among men. Between 1994-96 and 2008-10, maximum prevalences of BMI430 increased from 25 to 38% (larger increases in men than women), reaching a peak at age 60-70 years in both sexes. This peak prevalence was 5-10 years later than in 1994-96 for men and remained unchanged for women. Between 1994-96 and 2008-10, maximum prevalences of high waist circumference (men4102 cm, women488 cm) increased from 30 to -70% in both sexes, peaking in 2008-10 at ages 80-85 years (men) and 65-70 years (women). In 2008-10, proportions of adults with 'normal' BMI (18.5-25) fell with age to 15-20% at age 60-70 years (men) and 75 years (women). Among all those with BMI \u00bc 18.5-25, aged465 years, the proportions with unhealthily elevated waist circumference were 30 (men494 cm) and 55% (women480 cm). CONCLUSIONS: Almost 40% of men and women are now becoming obese. People are growing fatter later in life, with waist circumference rising more persistently than BMI, which may indicate increased loss of muscle mass and sarcopenia in old age. Among older people, few now have 'normal' BMI, and of these up to half have elevated waist circumference, raising questions for the suitability of BMI as a measure of adiposity in this age group."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Mean body mass index (BMI, kg m", "text": "\u00c0 2 ) and prevalence of obesity (qua BMI430 kg m \u00c0 2 ) rise with age and are increasing in most populations. 1 Risks of type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease rise with very modest increases in weight in younger adults, and greater accumulation of body fat promotes a wide range of extra physical disabilities, inflammatory, neoplastic and metabolic diseases among older people. 2 Much research has focused on increasing adiposity in childhood, 3, 4 but most 'obese children', as currently defined, still need to gain a substantial amount of weight to reach BMI430 as adults. Emerging patterns of change of adiposity at later ages and the potential impact on health of older people are not well documented. 5 Some have suggested that a modest degree of overweight is beneficial at older ages in terms of mortality. [6] [7] [8] A recent metaanalysis suggested an apparent protective effect from BMI \u00bc 25-30, only BMI435 being associated with increased mortality. 9 However, mortality may not be the best outcome to consider nor BMI an optimal measure for this purpose, as BMI does not distinguish between body fat and muscle mass, which have opposite health impacts. Moreover, as overweight (BMI \u00bc [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] and obesity (BMI430) have become so much more frequent, the numbers with 'healthy' BMI \u00bc 18.5-25 has dwindled. 10 The fewer older people with BMIo25 and 25-30 are likely to include more individuals who have lost weight (and specifically muscle) from a previously higher category of BMI, through illness and inactivity. 11 Sarcopenia is more frequent among older individuals and sarcopenic obesity (low muscle with high body fat) may exist among those with BMI430 and even 25-30, impairing health and increasing mortality. 12 Waist circumference (WC) is a slightly better measure of adiposity than BMI, 13 and of health risks in older people, particularly when the BMIo30 where variations in muscle mass are not dominated by fat accumulation. 14 Better documentation of relationships between anthropometric measurements and health outcomes is required, particularly among older people. Applying standard BMI criteria, which originated from actuarial survival data in the mid-20th century insured Americans, may be misleading. The first step is to document associations and patterns of change. Elucidating the causes of changes and distinguishing between effects of age and cohort in these relationships over time demands analyses of longitudinal data sets.\nThis report documents patterns of change in BMI and WC in large national health surveys across a 14-year period, focussing particularly on age-specific peak prevalences of adults with elevated figures and the through proportions with 'normal' BMI.\nDistinguishing changes in BMI and WC may clarify the influences of altered body composition on health outcomes at older ages."}, {"section_title": "SUBJECTS AND METHODS", "text": "This study is a secondary analysis of data from the Scottish Health Survey (SHS) and the Health Survey for England, available through the Economic and Social Data Service.

During the first stage, personal interviews were conducted by a trained interviewer to collect information on socio-demographic factors, self-assessed health, disability, eating habits, health conditions, lifestyle factors such as smoking and drinking behaviours and health services use. Anthropometric measurements were taken by a trained nurse, including weight, height, waist and hip circumference. 15, 16 Data from four SHS (1995, 2008, 2009 and 2010) and six Health Survey for England (1994, 1995, 1996, 2008, 2009 and 2010) were combined into a single database, as two year groups, 1994-1996 and 2008-2010.

Maximum prevalence of BMI430 within a 5-year age band increased similarly, and age at that peak prevalence was delayed by 5 years, from 24.6% at age 55 years in 1994-96 to 38.5% at age 60 years in 2008-10.

Among women, maximum prevalences of both BMI425 and BMI430 remained at age 65 years ( Figures 3 and 4) . By 85 years, the proportion with healthy waist (o94 cms) had fallen to 20%.\nSimilar increases were seen in women.

Thus, by 2008-10, o10% of the female Scottish population had a WCo80 cm at age 65 years.\nIn summary, for women the changes in dynamics of the patterns of high WC over the 14 years separating the 2 surveys were broadly similar to those of BMI. Indeed, the maximum prevalence of WC488 occurred at the same age for both surveys (65 years), with a modest 5-year shift for the maximum prevalence of WC480 (Table 2 , Figures 3 and 4) . In men, however, there was a much bigger between-survey shift in the age with maximum prevalences of WC494 and WC4102 (20 years later for both), compared with the shift in age with maximum prevalences of BMI425 and BMI430 (5 years later for both).\nHigh WC always reached its peak prevalence later in life than BMI. In 1994-96 in men, there was a 10-year difference in the age with maximum prevalence of BMI425 (55 years) and with maximum prevalence for WC488 (65 years). This difference widened markedly in the 2008-10 survey with a 20-to 25-year age difference between maximum prevalences of BMI425 (60 years) and WC488 (80-85 years). This was not seen among women (Table 2) .\nAmong the small numbers of older 'normal-weight' Scottish individuals (aged 65 years), 13% of men had WC494 cm, increasing to 46% at age 80 years, and 70% of women had WC480 cm, 15% 488 cm (data for individual countries not shown).\nEnglish health survey data Body mass index. Between 1994-96 and 2008-10, mean BMI increased significantly at all ages, for both men and women and so did the prevalences of BMI425 and BMI430 (Po0.001; ANCOVA).\nAmong young men (18-22 years), the prevalence of BMI430 doubled from 5.2% in 1994-96 to 10.7% in 2008-10. In young women (18-22 years), the increase was larger, BMI430 reaching 17.8% in 2008-10 (Figures 1 and 2) .\nThe maximum prevalence of BMI425 within a 5-year age band increased in men, from 73.4% at age 60 years in 1994-96 to 83.0% at age 70 years in 2008-10. Maximum prevalence of BMI430 within a 5-year age band also increased, and age at that peak prevalence was delayed by 5 years, from 22.3% at age 65 years in Table 2 , Figures 1 and 2) . In 2008-10, the proportion of all adults with BMI \u00bc 18.5-25 (normal weight) had fallen to 14.7% of men (at age 70 years) and 19.3% of women at age 75 years.

No shift was seen in the age at maximum prevalence among women. In 2008-10, only 12% of women and 18.6% of men in England had a healthy WC at 70 and 80 years, respectively.\nAmong the small numbers of older 'normal weight' English individuals (65 years, BMI \u00bc 18.5-25), 32% of men had WC494 cm, 2.4%4102 cm and 49% of women had WC480 cm, 11%488 cm (data for individual countries not shown)."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Trends towards increasing obesity and overweight, using conventional BMI categories, in older people have been Distributions of BMI and waist with age A Vlassopoulos et al documented earlier, 19, 20 but how these trends reflect adiposity and health risks is less clear. 9 A large longitudinal Norwegian study documented rising BMI among younger individuals throughout 11-years' follow-up, but reductions in BMI of individuals 470 years of age, with a peak in BMI at about age 70 years. 21 The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging followed over 1000 men from birth to death and reported that body weight increased throughout life until 5 years before death. 22 The present larger study, in two neighbouring countries, allowed distributions of adult body compositions, by age, to be explored over 14 years (1994-96 vs 2008-10) and also between measures of adiposity (BMI vs WC).\nComparisons between 1994-96 and 2008-10 Many more young adults now emerge from childhood already obese, illustrating the dramatic effect of increased adiposity in childhood. In 2008-10, 12% of men and 20% of women already had BMI430 at age 20 years, at least double the prevalence observed 14 years earlier. Although 'childhood obesity' is of clinical concern in some cases, and it increasingly has an impact on obesity prevalence in early adulthood, the overall health burdens of obesity across whole populations are mainly driven by further weight gain in adult life, when prevalence of BMI430 now rises to almost 40% of the entire population. As a corollary, the BMI category 18.5-25 has dwindled to very low proportions of older people. Although this category is usually considered 'normal', BMI \u00bc 18.5-25 may not now indicate normal body composition in older people, among whom WC is more often increased.\nIn 2008-10, people were most likely to be classified as overweight or obese (BMI425 or 430) in their late 60s to early 70s. At that age, only 20% of all men and 15% of all women had BMI \u00bc 18.5-25, and among these 'normal-weight individuals, B30% of men and 55% of women had unhealthily increased WCs (494 cms in men, 480 cms in women) 18 ,23 ( Figure 5 ). It is tempting to speculate on the changes in the ages at which peak BMIs occur and reason for sex differences, but the cross-sectional nature of the present study prevents distinction between the influences of cohort effects (including environmental factors) and aging. The rising life expectancy probably has a part, 22 but there remain fundamental differences in body composition between the sexes, women gaining more fat as adolescents 20 and men gaining more in later adult life. Longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate causal factors. Distributions of BMI and waist with age A Vlassopoulos et al\nInterpretation of different measures of body composition Our data document generally greater WC, primarily indicating greater total body fat, in older people. 13 Although BMI decreases with age after reaching its peak prevalence at about age 65-70 years (in 2008-10), WC continues to increase, only peaking at 75-80 years of age. This suggests risks of sarcopenia, or sarcopenic obesity, 12 with associated physical and metabolic health risks. Frailty and weight loss are traditional focuses of concern in the elderly, 24, 25 but our data suggest that conventional BMI criteria alone may be insufficient. The mismatch between BMI and WC with age may also contribute to the apparently adverse impact of 'normal weight' on mortality, reported in various studies. 6, 7, 26, 27 A serious problem lies in the very small numbers of older adults, as low as 10-15%, who now have a BMI in the 'normal'/'healthy' range ( Figure 5 ). It is possible that a significant proportion of these older, normal-weight individuals have in fact lost weight, 11 and specifically muscle mass through illness and inactivity. The Health Survey for England and SHS did not include questions about recent weight loss, which would provide valuable evidence on this.\nTo explain the disconnect between age-specific distributions of WC and BMI, more detailed measures of body composition are needed. Rising WC could indicate either a gain in total body fat 13 or a redistribution of body fat towards a more central, intraabdominal preponderance. 28 WC ceases to be a linear indicator of body fat when above an upper limit of B130 cm, when the abdominal apron of fat hangs below the waist. This was not a major factor in the present study: only 0.6% of subjects had a WC 4130 cm. When the range of body fat or BMI is wide, then WC is likely to reflect mainly variations in total body fat. When the range in body fatness is small, then WC is likely to be a stronger indicator of intra-abdominal fat mass. 29 In the present survey data sets, there were substantial ranges in BMI and WC; hence, the major influence on WC is likely to be variation in total body fat. The adverse metabolic health impacts of rising WC include both those of elevated total body fat and a more central fat distribution, but the former mechanism is more amenable to preventive action. Unintentional weight loss, even in overweight and obese people, is associated with poor health outcomes, probably related to undiagnosed illness and loss of lean body tissue, as well as body fat. 30 More detailed characterisation of body composition and information on changes in weight are therefore urgently required within future population surveys."}, {"section_title": "Strengths and limitations", "text": "There are many limitations to analyses of cross-sectional survey data of this kind, but this study has many strengths from which to develop hypotheses. The numbers of subjects studied was very large. The response rates (published elsewhere 15, 16 ) were high (B70%) and quality of data completeness was high; hence, the samples can be considered to be at least broadly representative of the general populations. The methods used in the Scottish and English surveys were essentially the same; thus, comparisons between the countries are likely to be valid. The 1994-96 SHS did not include data for individuals above 65 years of age, which limits interpretation, although the similarities between Scottish and English data overall allows some confidence in drawing general conclusions. A combined analysis of data from both countries was not performed because of lack of participants aged above 65 years in 1994-96 SHS. The Health Survey for England of 1994, 1995 and 1996 offered greater numbers to characterise the 1994-96 population than the single 1995 SHS. Participants without a WC measurement had slightly higher BMI, but in both the 1994-96 and 2008-10 surveys (data not shown), which makes this unlikely to affect data interpretation.\nOver the 14-year period studied, change in distributions of BMI and WC in Scotland and England were very similar, allowing the general conclusion that overweight and obesity are increasing, with more older people affected, and the BMI category 18.5-25 dwindling to the point where it needs better characterisation before assuming that it represents 'normal' or healthful body composition. There were mostly only minor differences between countries, perhaps with generally greater WC in Scotland than England (Figures 3 and 4) . We have not sought to explain these national differences."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Overweight and obesity are rising and are peaking later in life. Within the 14-year study period (1994-96 to 2008-10) the distributions of BMI and WC have changed such that more young people enter adult life already obese, and more older people have adverse body composition. Almost 40% of all UK adults now become obese, and many older people with normal BMI (18.5-25) actually have elevated WC. The continuing rise of WC into older age groups is evidence of continued body fat accumulation and/or redistribution into older age, a major emerging public health concern. The use of BMI alone as a measure for adiposity in this age group may be misleading. Using WC might better identify adverse changes in body composition. "}]
