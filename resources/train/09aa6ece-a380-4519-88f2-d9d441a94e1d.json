As part of a recent research project in coastal Beaufort County, South Carolina, USA, we applied the Stormwater Runoff Modeling System (SWARM) to model various combinations of development levels and climate change scenarios. SWARM single-event output showed dramatic increases in runoff volume and rate, in some cases almost doubling under moderate climate change scenario and tripling under severe climate change scenario. In all cases, modeled impacts from climate change exceeded those of development.

For the continental United States (USA) from 1958 to 2012, the depth of the heaviest 1% of storms increased in every region; for the southeast, the increase was 27% [4] .\nIn the USA, stormwater runoff is a main driver of non-point source pollution in urbanized areas [5] . Runoff picks up contaminants that accumulate on impervious surfaces and delivers them to the receiving waterways [6] , and increasing development increases contaminant concentrations (e.g., chemicals, bacteria, viruses) [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . In areas with no stormwater systems, contaminated runoff flows unfiltered into the water, and in areas with combined sewer systems where the same pipe handles stormwater and sewage, heavy storm events cause overflows which increase the contamination [13] . Already, high runoff events from heavier storms overwhelms the drainage infrastructure in the USA, and this will only become worse with increased urbanization and heavier rains [14] .\nUSA coastal areas are growing rapidly with the greatest rate of increase occurring in the southeast [15] , where the development pressures result in a \"less forested landscape and large increases in the developed footprint\" [11, 16] . Growth will increase the amount of impervious surfaces, Geosciences 2016, 6, 34 2 of 12 intensifying the negative impacts of development by converting even more rainfall to stormwater runoff [11, 17] . In addition, flooding, already directly linked to heavy storms, is expected to increase with the projected increases in heavier rainfall [14] .\nThe purpose of this paper is to consider how heavier events may influence stormwater runoff. Additionally, since the impervious surfaces of urbanization are an important means by which developed lands modify hydrologic flow [18] , we look at the effect of heavier rains within the context of development.\nAs part of a recent research project in coastal Beaufort County, South Carolina (SC), USA, we applied the Stormwater Runoff Modeling System (SWARM) in four watersheds to model direct runoff using various combinations of development and climate change scenarios. Beaufort County is a rapidly-developing coastal community very concerned about the threat of stormwater degrading its estuarine environment. The study sites are within areas considered important to the county and have waterways identified as sensitive to runoff volume [19] .\nBy quantifying direct runoff based on climate change scenarios within the context of development, this paper will contribute to the understanding of the resulting potential changes in runoff and related watershed hydrology. Additionally, SWARM output can assist in resource management initial assessments on where limited resources should be placed for mitigating runoff impacts from current and projected development levels, as well as to gain insight of what might be expected from the frequent and heavier storms as climate changes."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Sites", "text": "Four watersheds were chosen for evaluation within Beaufort County, SC, USA: Okatie, May, Battery, and Wallace.

Initial abstraction, measured in millimeters, indicates the amount of rainfall required in order for runoff to begin in a specific watershed. Runoff volume, measured in cubic meters, is the actual modeled amount of runoff from the specified rainfall. Runoff ratio is the ratio of runoff to rainfall and shows the portion of the rainfall that is converted to runoff. Peak rate, measured in cubic meters per second, quantifies the largest flow rate during the runoff event and is the highest point on the hydrograph curve. Results for these four measurements are presented for the two development levels and then for the two climate change scenarios within each development level. For both runoff volume and peak rate, the watershed area is an important drive and, thus, relative comparisons between watersheds are precluded. Since the initial abstraction and runoff ratio are not based on area, comparisons can be made. Initial abstraction provides an indication of a watershed's runoff potential, and the greater the initial abstraction, the lower the runoff potential. Runoff ratio is based on the specific storm event modeled, showing the proportional runoff, and the higher the ratio, the higher the proportion of rainfall that is converted to runoff. Table 3 .

Communities like Beaufort County, SC, USA are concerned about the impact of stormwater runoff on their receiving waterbodies. In the case of Beaufort County, the receiving waterbodies are treasured tidal creeks and salt marshes which have high ecological and aesthetic value. This includes functioning as aquatic nursery habitats for fish, shrimp, and crabs, feeding grounds for wading birds, and pollutant processing [8] . Previous research has shown that relationships exist between development of the upland and the environmental quality of tidal creeks [7, 12, 30] . This connection and rapid growth has led to Beaufort County requiring progressive stormwater runoff requirements [31] .\nStudies have identified a relationship between stormwater runoff and the amount of impervious surfaces and low permeable soils [17, 32] with which our study agrees. The four study watersheds vary in their size, impervious cover, land use, and soil types. All of these variables have the potential to affect the volume and rate of stormwater runoff. One of the runoff metrics SWARM provides is the initial abstraction or rainfall amount required to initiate runoff which is a useful indicator of relative runoff potential between watersheds. The initial abstraction is not affected by rainfall amount and is based solely on watershed characteristics (i.e., hydrologic soil groups and land use) and antecedent runoff conditions. The initial abstraction is also highly related to the runoff ratio for the modeled scenarios (r 2 = 0.99). At the Current level, the initial abstraction was found to be the highest in the most undeveloped watershed, Wallace. The lowest initial abstraction was in the Okatie watershed, with the second highest level of development but the lowest level of permeable soils. This combination of developed surfaces and low permeable soils also results in the lowest relative change in initial abstraction from Current to Build-out scenarios. The highest relative change from Current to Build-out occurred in Wallace, as expected, due to the large amount of land transitioned to developed.\nQuantifying runoff volume and peak rate provides useful metrics important for initial understanding of potential for both flooding on the land and for transport of pollutants from the upland into receiving waterbodies [6, 17] . These are critical factors for stormwater managers to consider in planning for the future. The hydrographs constructed for each watershed provide a visual representation of the changes in runoff volume and peak rate from building out the watershed, as well as for expected climate changes. The hydrograph curves for the four modeled watersheds reveal a larger relative change in volume (i.e., the area under the curves) from Current to Build-out for Wallace, Battery, and May watersheds compared to the Okatie watershed. This reflects the relatively high initial runoff potential for Okatie resulting from the combination of developed lands and low soil permability. Due to these watershed characteristics, the impact of the Build-out will be less for Okatie than for the other watersheds. For all of the watersheds, the steeper and higher hydrograph curves for the Build-out and the climate change scenarios slopes compared to the Current slopes are an indication of the tremendous impact of additional development and heavier rainfall.\nA summary of the relative change in volume and peak rate from Current (2010) to Build-out shows similar patterns to the initial abstraction with a range of 22% (Okatie) to 80% (Wallace). For climate change scenarios at Current, runoff volume and peak rate increased by a range of 64% (Okatie) to 90% (Wallace) for moderate and by a range of 158% (Okatie) to 243% (Wallace) for severe. For climate change scenarios at Build-out, runoff volume and peak rate increased by a range of 48% (Battery) to 64% (Wallace) for moderate and by a range of 112% (Battery) to 158% (Wallace) for severe.. These modeled increases for runoff volume and peak rate need to be mitigated. The use of Best Management Practices (BMP) is a common way to try to mitigate these impacts; however, most BMPs in coastal SC merely detain (rather than retain) the runoff. Beaufort County has implemented a parcel-level infiltration requirement to retain the first 49.5 mm (1.95 in) of rainfall. This should be effective but has yet to be tested, and only applies to unincorporated areas.\nThe development effect is less than the influence of the climate change scenarios; however, the temporal timeframes are different for these effects. Considering the level of current development, it is possible that watersheds modeled in this study could be built out in the near future-perhaps in five to ten years-and our approach to building out the watersheds was very conservative and assumed similar development patterns to those already in the watershed. Climate will change over longer time periods. Managers are faced with making short-term decisions related to coastal development to limit the impacts from stormwater runoff on receiving waterbodies, but they also need to have the ability to plan for long-term implications from changing climatic conditions.\nA conservative approach combined with a simple and robust model can provide local communities with an understanding of the potential changes with which they will be faced. People are migrating to coastal regions all over the world and development of these areas is inevitable. Along the coast of SC, managing stormwater is a requirement; however, it is conducted at the individual development level with no requirement to consider the overall watershed. Coastal stormwater managers need to be cognizant of watershed scale changes that may occur as a result of a changing climate (e.g., heavier rains) within the context of increasing development.\nAuthor Contributions: Anne Blair conducted modeling for the study sites.
