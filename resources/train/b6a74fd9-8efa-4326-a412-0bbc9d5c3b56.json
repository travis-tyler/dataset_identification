In medical imaging, longitudinal anatomical changes can be modeled thanks to non-rigid registration of follow-up images. The comparison of longitudinal trajectories requires the transport (or \"normalization\") of longitudinal deformations in a common reference frame. We previously proposed an effective computational scheme based on the Schild's ladder for the parallel transport of diffeomorphic deformations parameterized by tangent velocity fields, based on the construction of a geodesic parallelogram on a manifold. Schild's ladder may be however inefficient for transporting longitudinal deformations from image time series of multiple time points, in which the computation of the geodesic diagonals is required several times. We propose here a new algorithm, the pole ladder, in which one diagonal of the parallelogram is the baseline-toMarco Lorenzi and Xavier Pennec for the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.

This drastically reduces the number of geodesics to compute. Moreover, differently from the Schild's ladder, the pole ladder is symmetric with respect to the baseline-to-reference frame geodesic. From the theoretical point of view, we show that the pole ladder is rigorously equivalent to the Schild's ladder when transporting along geodesics.

For such purposes we need to analyze and compare the observed anatomical differences between follow-up sequences of anatomical images of different subjects. Non-rigid registration is one of the main instruments for modeling anatomical differences from images. The aim of non-rigid registration is to encode the observed structural changes as deformation fields densely represented in the image space, which represent the warping required to match the observed differences. This way, the anatomical changes can be modeled and quantified by analyzing the associated deformations."}, {"section_title": "Normalizing Longitudinal Deformations in a Common", "text": "Reference Frame\nWe can identify two distinct settings for the application of non-rigid registration: longitudinal and cross-sectional.\nIn the former, non-rigid registration estimates the deformation field which explains the longitudinal anatomical (intrasubject) changes that usually reflect biological phenomena of interest, like atrophy or growth. In the latter, the deformation field accounts for the anatomical differences between different subjects (inter-subject), in order to match homologous anatomical regions. These two settings are profoundly different, since in the cross-sectional setting we want to compare different anatomies which might have different topologies. In this case the deformations are often a scale of magnitude higher than the ones characterizing the usually subtle variations of the longitudinal setting.\nIn case of group-wise analysis of longitudinal deformations, longitudinal and cross-sectional settings must be integrated in a consistent manner. In fact, the comparison of longitudinal deformations is usually performed after normalizing them in a common reference frame through the inter-subject registration, and the choice of the normalization method might have a deep impact on the following analysis. In order to preserve and accurately quantify longitudinal deformations in a reference frame space, a rigorous and reliable procedure need thus to be defined.\nNormalization of longitudinal deformations can be done in different ways, depending on the analyzed feature. For instance, the scalar Jacobian determinant of longitudinal deformations represents the associated local volume change, and can be compared by scalar resampling in a common reference frame via inter-subject registration. This simple transport of scalar quantities is the basis of the classical deformation/tensor based morphometry techniques [3, 21] .\nIf we consider vector-values characteristics of deformations instead of scalar quantities, the transport is not uniquely defined anymore. For instance, a simple method of transport consists in reorienting the longitudinal intrasubject displacement vector field by the Jacobian matrix of the subject-to-reference deformation. Another intuitive method was proposed by [20] and uses the transformation conjugation (change of coordinate system) in order to compose the longitudinal intra-subject deformation with the subject-to-reference one. As pointed out in [7] , this practice could potentially introduce variations in the transported deformation and relies on the inverse consistency of the estimated deformations, which can raise numerical problems for large deformations."}, {"section_title": "Parallel Transport in Diffeomorphic Registration", "text": "Among these different normalization methods, the parallel transport of longitudinal deformations is a powerful and promising tool which can be used within the \"diffeomorphic registration\" setting, thanks to its rich mathematical background. Mathematically, parallel transporting a vector X along a curve \u03b3 (t) consists in translating it across the tangent spaces to the curve by preserving its parallelism, according to a given derivative operation called (affine) connection, and indicated with \u2207 \u03b3 (t) (X) . The connection \u2207 is a bilinear function which maps tangent vectors across nearby tangent spaces, and a vector is parallel transported along a curve if \u2207 \u03b3 (t) (X) = 0, for all t.\nA first formulation of diffeomorphic registration was proposed with the \"Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM)\" setting [5, 23] . In this framework the images are registered by minimizing the length of the trajectory of transformations in the space of diffeomorphism, once specified an opportune right invariant metric. The solution is the endpoint of the flow of a time-varying velocity field, which is a geodesic parameterized through the Riemannian exponential. The LDDMM deformations are thus Riemannian (metric) geodesics, which are also geodesics of the Levi-Civita connection, which is the unique torsion-free connection which preserves the metric. 1 Since LDDMM is generally computationally intensive, a different diffeomorphic registration method was later proposed with the stationary velocity field (SVF) setting [2] . In this case the diffeomorphisms are parameterized by stationary velocity fields through the Lie group exponential. The restriction to stationary velocity fields simplifies the registration problem and provides efficient numerical schemes for the computation of deformations. This time the flow associated to SVFs is a one-parameter subgroup, which is a geodesic with respect to the Cartan-Shouten connections [14, 17] . One-parameter subgroups are generally not metric geodesics, since there do not exist any left and right invariant metric on non-compact and non-commutative groups.\nIn both the LDDMM and SVF settings, the longitudinal deformation is encoded by the initial tangent velocity field. The transport of longitudinal deformations can be then naturally formulated as the parallel transport of tangent vectors along geodesics according to the underlying connection, i.e. the Levi-Civita connection in LDDMM, and the canonical symmetric Cartan-Shouten connection in the SVF setting.\nAs illustrated in abstract form in [1] , parallel translation can be approximated infinitesimally by Jacobi fields. Following this intuition, a computational method for the parallel transport along geodesics of the right invariant metric was proposed in the LDDMM context by [25] . This framework enables to transport diffeomorphic deformations of point supported and image data, and it was applied to study the hippocampal shape changes in Alzheimer's disease [18, 19] . Although it represents a rigorous implementation of the parallel transport, it comes to the price of the computationally intense scheme for computing geodesics. More importantly, it is limited to the transport along geodesics of the right invariant metric, and does not allow to specify different metrics for longitudinal and inter-subject registrations. While from the theoretical point of view parallel transporting along a generic curve can be approximated by the parallel transport on piecewise geodesics, the effectiveness of the above methods was shown only on LDDMM geodesics, and no general computational schemes were provided.\nThe parallel transport in the SVF setting was investigated in [14] , in which an explicit formula for the parallel transport with respect to the standard Cartan-Shouten connections (left, right and symmetric) in the case of finite dimensional Lie groups was derived. Then it was proposed to seamlessly apply these formulas in the infinite dimensional case of the diffeomorphic registration of images. Although further investigations would be needed to better understand the impact of generalizing to infinite dimensions the concepts and tools defined for the Lie Group theory in finite dimension, practical examples of parallel transport of longitudinal diffeomorphisms in synthetic and real images with respect to the Cartan-Shouten connections showed to be an effective and simple way to transport tangent SVFs."}, {"section_title": "Contributions and Paper Structure", "text": "In this paper we focus on explicit discrete algorithms for parallel transport.\nMore specifically, we contribute the pole ladder, a new general and computationally efficient method for parallel transport derived from the Schild's ladder. The proposed method rely on a solid mathematical background and can be easily used in the LDDMM and SVF registration settings where diffeomorphic transformations are parameterized by their initial tangent vectors.\nAlthough the Schild's ladder was known in gravitation theory for 40 years, there does not seem to be any numerical implementation of this algorithm before [13] , in which we turned it into an effective algorithm for the parallel transport of deformation vectors. This manuscript is an extension of our recent conference submission [15] , and elaborates over these preliminary works to provide a novel construction called the pole ladder. We show that is equivalent to the Schild's ladder when transporting along arcs of geodesics, but with the computational advantage of minimizing the number of estimation of geodesics when applied to the parallel transport of time series of deformations over multiple time points.\nIn Sect. 3 we detail the mathematical basis of the proposed method, while in Sect. 4 we show how these theoretical concepts can be effectively translated in the image registration context.

The method infinitesimally transports a vector along a given curve through the construction of geodesic parallelograms (Fig. 1) . The Schild's ladder provides a straightforward method to compute a first order approximation of the parallel transport of a vector along a curve using geodesics only. Let M a manifold and C a curve parametrized by the parameter \u03c4 with \u2202C \u2202\u03c4 | T 0 = u, and A \u2208 T P 0 M, a tangent vector on the curve at the point P 0 = C(0). Let P 1 be a point on the curve relatively close to P 0 , i.e. separated by a sufficiently small parameter value \u03c4 . The Schild's ladder computes the parallel transport of A along the curve C as follows:\n1. Define a curve on the manifold parametrized by a parameter \u03c3 passing through the point P 0 with tangent vector \u2202 \u2202\u03c3 | P 0 = A. Choose a point P 2 on the curve separated by P 0 by the value of the parameters \u03c3 . The values of the parameters \u03c3 and \u03c4 should be chosen in order to construct the Schild's ladder within a single coordinate neighborhood. 2. Let l be the geodesic connecting P 2 = l(0) and P 1 = l(\u03bb), we choose the \"middle point\" P 3 = l(\u03bb/2). Now, let us define the geodesic r connecting the starting point P 0 and P 3 parametrized by \u03c1 such that P 3 = r(\u03c1). By extending the geodesic at the parameter 2\u03c1 we reach the point P 4 . We can now pick a curve connecting P 1 and P 4 . The vector A tangent to the curve at the point P 1 is the parallel translation of A along C. 3. If the distance between the points P 0 and P 1 is large, the above construction can be iterated for a sufficient number of small steps.\nThe algorithmic interest of the Schild's ladder is that it only relies on the geometrical information encoded by the geodesics. Although the geodesics on the manifold are not sufficient to recover all the information about the space properties, such as the torsion of the connection, it has been shown that the Schild's ladder describes the parallel transport with respect to the symmetric part of the connection of the space [10] . An intuitive view of that point is that the construction of the above diagram is commutative and can be symmetrized with respect to the points P 1 and P 2 . If the original connection is symmetric, then this procedure provides a correct linear approximation of the parallel transport of vectors."}, {"section_title": "The Pole Ladder", "text": "We propose here a different construction for the parallel transport of vectors based on geodesics parallelograms. If the curve C is geodesic, then it can be itself one of the diagonals and the Schild's ladder can therefore be adapted by requiring the computation of only one new diagonal of the parallelogram. We define in this way a different ladder scheme, that we name the \"pole ladder\".\nWe now prove that the pole ladder is actually realizing the parallel transport. In the diagram of Fig. 2 , the parallel transport of the tangent vector v =\u010a to the geodesic C is specified through the Christoffel symbols \u0393 k ij by the geodesic equationv + \u0393 k ij v i v j = 0. In a sufficiently small neighborhood the relationships can be linearized to give and by integrating:\nBy renormalizing the length of the vector v so that C(\u22121)\n, we obtain the relations:\nSimilarly, we have along the second geodesic:\nNow, to compute the geodesics joining P 0 to P 1 and Q 0 to Q 1 , we have to use a Taylor expansion of the Christoffel symbols \u0393 k ij around the point M. In the following, we indicate the coordinate according to which the quantity is derived by the index after a comma:\nHowever, the Christoffel symbols are multiplied by a term of order O( A 2 ), so that only the first term will be quadratic and all others will be of order 3 with respect to A and v M . Thus, the geodesics joining P 0 to P 1 and Q 0 to Q 1 have equations:\nEquating P k 1 in the previous equations gives\nSolving for u as a second order polynomial in v M and A gives\nNow equating Q k 1 in the previous equations gives\nSolving for B k as a second order polynomial in v M and A gives:\nTo verify that this is the correct formula for the parallel transport of A, let us observe that the field\n(1) shows that the pole ladder leads to B k \u2212A k + 2\u0393 k ij A i v j . Thus the pole ladder is realizing the parallel transport for a length = 2 (remember that our initial geodesic was defined from \u22121 to 1).\nWe have thus demonstrated that the vector \u2212B of Fig. 2 is the transport of A and, due to the locally linear construction, it corresponds necessarily to the one transported by the Schild's ladder."}, {"section_title": "Application to Images", "text": "Let I i (i = 1 . . . n) be a time series of images with the baseline I 0 as reference.

In the sequel, we focus on the transport of a single image I 1 .\nTo apply the ladders in the context of the images, we define the paths in the space of images by action from the space of diffeomorphism.

If the distance between two images in the image space is defined in terms of diffeomorphisms [25] , then the Algorithm 1 Schild's ladder for the transport of a longitudinal deformation Let I 0 and I 1 be a series of images, and T 0 a reference frame. geodesics in the image space are defined by the action of the geodesic paths in the space of the diffeomorphisms. The Schild's ladder can be naturally translated in the image context (Algorithm 1), by requiring the computation of the two diagonal geodesics l and r.\nThe pole ladder is similar to the Schild's one, with the difference of explicitly using as a diagonal the geodesic C which connects I 0 and T 0 (Algorithm 2). This is an interesting property since, given C, it requires the computation of only one additional geodesic, thus the transport of time series of several images is based on the same baseline-toreference curve C (Fig. 3) ."}, {"section_title": "Effective Ladders by Using SVFs", "text": "We showed that Schild's and pole ladder are equivalent methods for transporting vectors with geodesic parallelogram. In this paragraph we provide an efficient implementation for the application to images within the SVF setting. Due to the similar nature of the proposed ladders schemes, in the following we refer generally to \"ladder\" to indicate the two techniques. Fig. 3 Geometrical schemes in the Schild's ladder (left), and in the pole ladder (right). By using the curve C as diagonal, the pole ladder requires the computation of half times of the geodesics required by the Schild's ladder Despite the straightforward formulation, Algorithms 1 and 2 require multiple evaluations of geodesics in the space of diffeomorphisms and a consequent high cost in terms of computation time and resources.\nMoreover, they assume an exact matching, which is bound to lead to important numerical problems. For instance, the definition of I 1 2 using the forward deformation on I 0 or the backward from T 0 leads to very different results. Finally, numerical approximations introduced by exponential and logarithm maps can introduce important errors that can propagate during the iteration of the ladder. For all of these reason, we propose here to reformulate the above scheme in a computationally efficient framework using only transformations.\nWe use the setting of the SVFs (SVF) diffeomorphic registration as provided for example by the log-Demons [24] algorithm. In particular we base the ladder on the geodesic defined by the Lie group exponential of vector fields. Given a pairs of images I i , i \u2208 {0, 1}, the SVF framework parametrizes the diffeomorphism \u03d5 required to match the reference I 0 to the moving image I 1 by a SVF u. The velocity field u is an element of the Lie Algebra g of the Lie group of diffeomorphisms G, i.e. an element of the tangent space at the identity T id G. The diffeomorphism \u03d5 belongs to the one parameter subgroup \u03d5 = exp(t u) generated by u. Notice that we use here the Lie group exponential and not the Riemannian exponential to parameterize deformations with SVFs. We can therefore define the paths in the space of the diffeomorphisms from the one parameter subgroup parametrization\nand the correspondent paths in the image space.\nComputing the ladders in the image space requires a number of interpolations and exponentiations, which could introduce biases due to the numerical approximations. Moreover the registration is constrained to be smooth and it is therefore impossible to reach a perfect match of correspondent intensities in the registered images. We take advantage of the symmetry of the geodesic parallelogram in order to define the following robust scheme. \nwhere E is a generic registration energy functional to be minimized.\nThe half space image I 1 2 can be defined in terms of v/2 as exp(\u2212v/2) * T 0 or exp(v/2) * I 0 . While from the theoretical point of view the two images are identical, the choice of one of them, or even their mean, introduces a bias in the construction. The definition of the half step image can be bypassed by relying on the symmetric construction of the parallelogram. \nThe transport of the deformation \u03d5 = exp(u) can be therefore obtained through the conjugate action operated by the deformation parametrized by v/2.\nSince the direct computation of the conjugation by composition is potentially biased by the spatial discretization, we propose a numerical scheme to correctly evaluate the transport directly in the Lie Algebra."}, {"section_title": "BCH Formula for the Conjugate Action", "text": "The Baker Campbell Hausdorff (BCH) formula was introduced in the SVF diffeomorphic registration in [6] and provides an explicit way to compose diffeomorphisms parameterized by SVFs by operating in the associated Lie Algebra.

In particular, for small u, the computation can be truncated to any order to obtain a valid approximation for the composition of diffeomorphisms. Applying the truncate BCH to the conjugate action leads to\nTo establish this formula, let consider the following second order truncation of the BCH formula\nThe composition\nThe second order truncation of the four terms is:\nFrom the additive and anticommutative properties of the Lie bracket, adding the four terms leads to (2) ."}, {"section_title": "Iterative Computation of the Ladder", "text": "Once defined the formula for the computation of the ladder, we need a consistent scheme for the iterative construction along trajectories. We recall that the transport by geodesic parallelograms holds only if both sides of the parallelogram are sufficiently small, which in our case means that both longitudinal and inter-subject vectors must be small. This is not the case in practice, since the inter-subject deformation is usually very strong. By definition, the ladder requires to scale down vectors to a sufficiently small neighborhood, in order to correctly approximate the transport by parallelograms. From the theoretical point of view, the degree of approximation of the ladder is proportional to the curvature of the space of deformations. This can be seen by the higher order terms that we dropped off in the proof of Sect. 3.2, which are all derivatives of the Christoffel symbols. While on a linear space the ladder is the exact parallel transport, when working on curved spaces the error resulting from the noninfinitesimal geodesic parallelogram is proportional to the distance between the points.\nFrom the numerical point of view, we notice that Formula (2) requires the computation of the Lie brackets of the velocity fields. Lie brackets involve the differentiation of the vector which is usually computed on images by finite differences, and which are know to be very sensitive to noise and to be unstable in case of large deformations.\nFor all these reasons we propose the following iterative scheme based on the properties of SVFs. To provide a sufficiently small vector for the computation of the conjugate we observe that\nThe conjugation can then be recursively computed in the following way:\n3. Let u = w. 4. Iterate the steps 2 and 3 n times.\nThe BCH formula allows to perform the transport directly in the Lie algebra and avoids multiple exponentiation and interpolations, thus reducing the bias introduced by the numerical approximations. Moreover, this method preserves the original \"ladder\" formulation, operated along the intersubject geodesic exp(tv). In fact it iterates the construction of the ladder along the path exp(tv) over small steps of size exp( v n ).

Right: The log-Jacobian determinant of the transported deformations shows that a larger step-size leads to more unstable results\nThe stability of the proposed method critically depends from the initial scaling step n, which determines the stepsize of the numerical scheme. Ideally the step-size should depend on the curvature, and should be therefore small enough in order to minimize the error in case of highly curved space. For this purpose, given the image domain \u03a9, we define a global scaling factor n in order to guarantee that the given SVF stays sufficiently close to 0, i.e. in order to satisfy the global condition max x\u2208\u03a9 v(x) /n < \u03b4, with \u03b4 = 0.5 * voxel _ size. This condition ensures reasonably small SVFs, and thus enables the iterative construction of the parallelogram in small neighborhoods.

The mathematical formulation was combined with an effective computational scheme in order to provide a solution for the transport of vector fields.\nFrom the applicative point of view, the availability of multivariate features in a common space could provide novel information for the understanding of biological processes. Moreover, although designed for transporting vector quantities, the method showed also good results in transporting scalar measures, by preserving smoothness of the corresponding spatial maps and providing accurate numerical evaluations. This is an interesting feature which could increase the power in TBM-like group-wise statistical analysis as well as opening the way to reliable multivariate groupwise analysis. The high spatial resolution of the statistical results on the experiment on the real data suggests a high precision of the procedure in transporting the different subject-specific trajectories. When associating the proposed transport with specific frameworks for the estimation of longitudinal trajectories, we were able to consistently model the longitudinal changes in clinical populations by including multiple time points, and to compare the progression of different clinical groups on a multidimensional basis [12] . As shown in the experimental section, the stability of the proposed ladder critically depends on the choice of the scaling factor.\nEven though the proposed scheme seems to provide reasonable and stable results, further perspective studies are required in order to investigate the numerical issues related to the step-size of the iterative computation. Finally, the comparison of the pole ladder with other computational schemes of the parallel transport, such as with the one proposed in [25] , might shed more light on the theoretical and numerical properties of different methods of transport."}]
