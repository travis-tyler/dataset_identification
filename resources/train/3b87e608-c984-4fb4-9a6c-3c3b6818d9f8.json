The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, United States", "text": "Background: Research shows that ethnic differences exist in hospice service election, with fewer African American patients enrolling in hospice and having lower satisfaction with care compared to Non-Hispanic Whites. Hospice is interdisciplinary, with nursing care and \"ancillary\" services (social work, chaplain, nurses' aide, volunteer). Little research exists about whether disparities exist in ancillary service election, and if patient demographics correlate with service utilization. We examined if ethnic or demographic differences exist among hospice beneficiaries in utilization of hospice services. Methods: Mixed-methods data collection took place from two community hospices. The quantitative arm involved retrospective chart review on new admissions from 2012 to 2016: acceptance of ancillary services and demographic data were collected as well as code status and outcome of hospice admission. The qualitative arm collected interview data from hospice personnel about thoughts on hospice care, which patients they think might decline ancillary services, and why. Results: Chart review was completed on 491 patient charts: interviews of hospice staff are ongoing. Sample was 55% female, 77% white, average age 77.8 years. Initial analysis on demographic data did not show statistical significance in utilization. Declination was lowest for social work (3.4% declined) and highest for hospice volunteer (88.9% declined). Initial interview themes involved need for patient education and role of health literacy. Discussion: Initial research does not show statistical ethnic or demographic differences in ancillary service utilization. However, broad utilization differences exist between services. Data can identify areas where hospices can improve care accessibility through patient education and personalization of services. Limited work has been performed in helping hospice agencies to care for persons with dementia (PWD) and their caregivers in an evidence-based manner despite the increasing number of PWD cared for in this setting. To change the culture of care for PWD and their caregivers receiving hospice, we adapted Aliviado Dementia Care, an evidenced-based interdisciplinary quality improvement program, for use in hospice. The purpose of this pilot study is to examine feasibility and applicability of implementing the Aliviado Dementia Care-Hospice Edition sequentially in 2 hospice agencies in preparation for a nation-wide pragmatic trial. In the first pilot, concluded in March 2019, seven hospice interdisciplinary clinicians were trained as program champions and completed a two-day in-person intensive training on dementia symptom assessment and management, and quality improvement processes. Additionally, 47 interdisciplinary team (IDT) members were provided training via a 5-hour, online program covering dementia symptom assessment and management. All champions trained (100%) reported being satisfied/very satisfied with the program and agreed that the training is applicable to hospice practices. All IDT members who completed the online training (100%) reported being satisfied/very satisfied with the program quality, or agreed/strongly agreed that the content was relevant. The high rates of satisfaction and applicability, reported by the hospice champions and IDT members, provided preliminary evidence supporting the feasibility and applicability of the Aliviado Dementia Care-Hospice Edition. The Manitoba Follow-up Study is in its 71st year of continuous operation. Since 1948, 3,983 aircrew recruits to the Royal Canadian Air Force during the Second World War have submitted routine medical examinations and completed questionnaires. On May 1, 2006, 1001 of these men (25%) were alive mean age of 86 years. The effects of 7 chronic diseases (CDs) diagnosed before 2006 were modeled with multinomial logistic regression to predict the pattern of decline of living and dying through an 11 year window to 2017. By 2017, 11% were still alive, 10% died very early in the window, 44% experienced a slow decline of a least three years to death, 17% experienced a step decline to death, and 18% experienced a terminal drop, death within six months of decline in functioning. Only 30% were free of CD in 2006; 36% had 1 CD, and 34% had more than 1 CD. As the number of CDs increased, the probability of remaining alive by 2017 decreased: 18% alive if no CD, 10% if 1 CD, 8% if 2 CDs, and 3% of >2 CDs. The chance of death with a terminal drop decreased: 22% if no CD, 20% if 1 CD, 14% if 2 CD, 11% if >2 CD. Conversely, the percent with a gradual decline to death increased with more CDs. Among old men are already in their 80s, a key determinant of the trajectory to end of life is the number of CDs. Background: Palliative Care (PC) is a valuable tool for improving the lives of people living with chronic illness. However, access to PC is limited in rural areas. The purpose of this study is to describe the current PC needs and barriers to care in a rural state. Methods: An online survey was disseminated through professional organizations, licensing boards, and the University of Wyoming. Rurality of counties was classified using Rural Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC). Descriptive statistics were calculated using SPSS. Results: Responses were received from 336 individuals across 20 of 23 counties (i.e., RUCC range 3 -9; 1=most metropolitan, 9=most rural). The majority worked in healthcare or social service sectors (n = 265, 78.8%). Approximately onehalf (n = 119, 50.6%) of these individuals endorsed providing PC (i.e., typically symptom management, supportive resources, and family support). Over one-half of respondents (n = 173, 51.5%) rated availability of PC services in their communities as \"poor\" or \"somewhat good.\" Key barriers to providing PC were lack of patient information and knowledge (n = 215), access to PC specialists (n = 183), and funding and reimbursement (n = 181). Approximately one third of healthcare professionals (n = 78, 32.8%) had received formal training in PC. A majority of healthcare and social service respondents (n = 139, 59.1%) endorsed interest in PC continuing education. Conclusions: This study provides insight into the state of PC across a rural state. Results highlight the need to design accessible education and implement system transformation to improve PC access. Background: An innovative educational program addresses two gaps in health professions education: lack of an emerging workforce comfortable caring for older adults and proficiency in working in an interprofessional (IP) setting. We sought to explore whether AIP provides grounding in pillars of IPE and geriatric competencies through experiential learning in IP teams with older adults in a community setting. Methods: Early health profession students n=37 (MD, MSN, PA, SW), working in teams of 3, made monthly visits to older adults' residences over a oneyear period. Workshops on core geriatric and IPE principles defined expected learning goals for client visits. Visits were followed by: 1) written field notes; 2) reflections based on pre-determined learning prompts; and 3) debriefing sessions with faculty members. Students completed pre and post program questionnaires including Attitudes Towards Social Issues in Medicine, Geriatrics Attitude Scale, ICCAS, and RIPLS. Pre-post results were analyzed using t-tests and qualitative analysis of comments. Results: 25 (68%) students completed pre-post questionnaires. Responses on the interprofessional collaboration scale significantly increased following the program (t=2.09; p = 0.047) and 94% responded that they could \"well\" or \"very well\" describe issues that impact older adults' health, quality of life, and convey appreciation toward older adults. Discussion: Students, engaging with older adults longitudinally in a community setting learned pillars of IPE, geriatric care competencies, and gained insights into this population. An interprofessional, experiential learning program is feasible and effective way to increase interest and self-efficacy in working with older adult populations. One of the biggest barriers to encouraging a new generation of students to consider careers in aging are the ageist attitudes that they hold and the negative images of aging that they are bombarded with through the media. Sociologists have learned that an effective way to combat ageism is to bring together individuals from different cultural groups, including different age cohorts, to improve social attitudes. In a 2018 AGHE presentation, Jill J. Naar, explored the idea of promoting age-friendly universities by creating intergenerational education tourism programs. In this presentation I share my experience in leading an intergenerational study abroad in Germany that included five generations studying the creation of public memory on the eve of the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. I will share some of the logistical considerations along with the way that the study abroad helped to meet some of the AGHE competencies for undergraduate programs in Gerontology. We investigated the feasibility of a Medicaid Home and Community-based Services home care aide (HCA) led health interview with clients (n=21) during usual care services provided by a single provider. We provided interview training in English and Spanish and HCAs (n=21) conducted five interviews using a card sort methodology to elicit client care preferences. The interviews consisted of five topics relative to care: 1) food and drink,"}, {"section_title": "CHRONIC DISEASE AND TERMINAL DECLINE IN", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "PALLIATIVE CARE NEEDS ASSESSMENT OF A RURAL AND FRONTIER STATE", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "SESSION 875 (POSTER)", "text": "ENGAGING"}, {"section_title": "THE FALL OF THE BERLIN WALL AND STEREOTYPES", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "SESSION 880 (POSTER)", "text": "FAMILY"}]
