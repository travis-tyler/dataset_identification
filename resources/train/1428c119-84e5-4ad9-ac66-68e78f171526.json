[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract Neuroimaging genetics has attracted growing attention and interest, which is thought to be a powerful strategy to examine the influence of genetic variants (i.e., single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) on structures or functions of human brain. In recent studies, univariate or multivariate regression analysis methods are typically used to capture the effective associations between genetic variants and quantitative traits (QTs) such as brain imaging phenotypes. The identified imaging QTs, although associated with certain genetic markers, may not be all disease specific. A useful, but underexplored, scenario could be to discover only those QTs associated with both genetic markers and disease status for revealing the chain from genotype to phenotype to symptom. In addition, multimodal brain imaging phenotypes are extracted from different perspectives and imaging markers consistently showing up in multimodalities may provide more insights for mechanistic understanding of diseases (i.e., Alzheimer's disease (AD)). In this work, we propose a general framework to exploit multi-modal brain imaging phenotypes as intermediate traits that bridge genetic risk factors and multiclass disease status. We applied our proposed method to explore the relation between the well-known AD risk SNP APOE rs429358 and three baseline brain imaging modalities (i.e., structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and F-18 florbetapir PET scans amyloid imaging (AV45)) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method not only helps improve the performances of imaging genetic associations, but also discovers robust and consistent regions of interests (ROIs) across multi-modalities to guide the disease-induced interpretation."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive impairment of memory and other cognitive functions in elderly people worldwide (Brookmeyer et al. 2007) . Effective prevention and treatment of AD is a major challenge, given that no disease-modifying medicine in AD is available. To address this challenge, many AD studies focus on systems biology of the brain to better understand complex neurobiological systems, from genetic factors, protein products, cellular components, and to the complex Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (www. loni.usc.edu/ADNI). As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report.

An emerging research field, imaging genetics, focuses on study genetics using imaging measures as intermediate phenotypes, which is different from case-control studies (Glahn et al. 2007; Gottesman and Gould 2003) , and may yield interesting results for us to understand the complex biological mechanism of the disease (i.e., AD).\nIn prior imaging genetics research, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed to identify the associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and imaging quantitative traits (QTs). To address the high dimensionality of the imaging genetics data, some hypothesis-driven approaches have focused on a small number of genetic variables and searched for their QT associations in the whole brain (Brun et al. 2009; Filippini et al. 2009 ). In contrast, some other studies have focused on a limited number of imaging QTs and searched for their SNP associations in the entire genome (Baranzini et al. 2009; Potkin et al. 2009 ). In recent studies, taking into account the inherent structure among genotype or phenotype data (e.g., spatial information in images or combining the effect of multiple genetic variants), some researchers have developed several generalized multivariate linear regression analysis or least square kernel machine methods to boost the detection power (Ge et al. 2012; Hibar et al. 2011; Kohannim et al. 2011 Kohannim et al. , 2012 Wang et al. 2012b) . Although those methods may have potentials to help discover structured phenotypic imaging markers related to some candidate risk SNPs, the problem of existing methods in imaging genetics is that phenotypes could be related to many genetic markers on different pathways that are not all disease specific. A valuable scenario would be to discover only those QTs associated with both genetic markers and disease status to better reveal the biological pathways specific to the disease. Thus, it is an important research topic to incorporate the subjects' diagnosis information (e.g., class labels), and to discover disease-specific imaging genetic associations on the chain from genetic data to brain to symptom.\nMore recently, some diagnosis information guided methods have been proposed in the field of imaging genetics. The method proposed in (Vounou et al. 2010 (Vounou et al. , 2012 ) employed a two-step procedure for detecting genetic factors associated with imaging biomarkers: 1) firstly, they pre-selected the disease relevant voxel level imaging phenotypes with high classification performance between AD and healthy control group using penalized linear discriminant analysis; 2) secondly, they identified the SNPs associated with the multivariate imaging biomarkers identified from the first step. Different from general linear regression models, another framework employed Bayesian theory for detecting genetic variants associated with disease related imaging QTs (Batmanghelich et al. 2013 ). The Bayesian model performed genetic identification and imaging feature selection simultaneously, and could identify interesting associations along the pathway from gene to imaging and then to symptom.\nIn addition, most of existing imaging genetic studies (Batmanghelich et al. 2013; Vounou et al. 2010 Vounou et al. , 2012 Wang et al. 2012a, b) have focused on the associations between only single imaging modality (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-voxel based morphometry (VBM) or FreeSurfer measures) and SNPs. These methods can identify interesting patterns within a certain modality, but are limited in discovery of consistent regional patterns across multiple modalities.\nTo address the above challenges, this work aims to identify consistent brain regions whose multimodal imaging measures can serve as intermediate traits between genetic risk factor and disease status. Our goal is to design a simple and powerful model to extract disease-relevant imaging genetic associations. Accordingly, we develop a novel diagnosis-guided multi-modality (DGMM) framework that can discover common regions of interests (ROIs) that are associated with both risk genetic factors and disease status (Hao et al. 2016) . In this study, to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our DGMM method, we perform extensive experiments on three modalities of phenotypes, voxel-based measures extracted from structural MRI, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)) scans, and 18-F florbetapir (AV-45) PET scans (i.e., amyloid imaging data). We examine their associations with apolipoprotein E (APOE) SNP rs429358 (the best known AD genetic risk factor, see those in the AlzGene database (www.alzgene.org)) (Filippini et al. 2009; Liu et al. 2015) . All the data are downloaded from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. The empirical results on ADNI show that our method not only yields improved performances under the metrics of correlation coefficient and root mean squared error, but also detects a compact set of consistent and robust ROIs across three imaging modalities which are relevant to the genetic risk marker."}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Given a genetic risk SNP, it is also important to identify its quantitative traits at brain structure and functional level to help understand the underlying biological mechanism.\nSome researchers have identified a number of genes in addition to APOE \u03b54 that may increase a person's risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), including BIN1, CLU, PICALM, and CR1, see those in Lambert et al. (Lambert et al. 2013 ) and the AlzGene database (www.alzgene.org). APOE \u03b54 is called a risk-factor gene because it increases a person's risk of developing the disease. To our knowledge, APOE (located on chromosome 19) has a key role in coordinating the mobilization and redistribution of cholesterol, phospholipids, and fatty acids, and it is implicated in mechanisms such as neuronal development, brain plasticity, and repair functions (Mahley and Rall 2000) . In imaging genetics research experiments, several whole-brain studies focused on mapping this genetic risk factor (Filippini et al. 2009; Liu et al. 2015) . Accordingly, in our experiments, we focus on the susceptibility SNP rs429358, which is determined using APOE \u025b2/\u025b3/\u025b4 status information (www.snpedia.com/index.php/APOE) from the ADNI clinical database for each participant. As shown in Fig. 1 , there are three subtypes according to the relationship between APOE \u025b2/\u025b3/\u025b4 and the two SNPs (i.e., rs429358 and rs7412). And the allelic variant on rs429358 corresponds to the absence or presence of APOE \u025b4: (1) allele C at rs429358 indicates an \u025b4 allele, and (2) allele T at rs429358 indicates a none-\u025b4 allele (i.e., \u025b2 or \u025b3).\nIn our experiments, rs429358 value was coded in an additive fashion as 0, 1 or 2, indicating the number of minor alleles (i.e., C alleles or APOE \u025b4 copies). If we considered APOE \u025b4 as our target genetic risk of AD, the value was also coded as 0, 1 or 2, but indicating the number of APOE \u025b4 copies. Thus, the association study results on rs429358 should be consistent with the results on APOE \u025b4.\nImaging Phenotype Data (Ashburner and Friston 2007) . 116 ROI level measurements of mean gray matter densities, FDG-PET glucose utilization, and AV45 amyloid values were further extracted based on the MarsBaR AAL atlas (Tzourio-Mazoyer et al. 2002) . After removal of cerebellum, the imaging measures on each modality (VBM, FDG or AV45) of 90 ROIs were used as QTs in our experiments. All the measures were pre-adjusted for age, gender, and education. In this section, we systematically develop our computational models to explore the association between risk candidate SNPs and imaging phenotypes. Our proposed method mainly addresses the problem based on the general linear (least square) regression approach. Given the imaging phenotypes X \u00bc x 1 ; \u2026; x n ; \u2026; x N \u00bd T \u2208R N\u00c2d as input and a pre-selected candidate SNP y \u00bc y 1 ; \u2026; y n ; \u2026; y N \u00bd T \u2208R N as output in the regression model, where N is the number of participants (sample size) and d is the number of imaging QTs (feature dimensionality). The association model is designed to solve:\nwhere R w \u00f0 \u00de is a regularization term and \u03bb is the corresponding regularization parameter. The weight vector w measures the relative importance of the imaging QTs in predicting the SNP genotype. To encourage the 'sparsity' among features, in the Lasso method a l 1 -norm regularization is imposed on the coefficients as follows:\nwhere \u03bb is a regularization parameter that controls the sparsity in the solution. The non-zero elements of w indicate that the corresponding input features are relevant to the regression outputs. This penalized regression method imposes l 1 -norm sparisty on the individual variables for feature selection (Kohannim et al. 2012; Tibshirani 2011) . Following the existing work (Wang et al. 2012a ), it's worth noting that the above mathematical formulations are also used for association studies between genotypes and phenotypes. In this prior work, the goal of the learned regression model was not only on the genotype prediction accuracy, but also on identifying biologically meaningful SNP and imaging markers and discovering the underlying complex biological mechanisms of the diseases, when the linear regression as the formulation of Eq. (1) was applied to exploring the imaging genetic associations."}, {"section_title": "Diagnosis-guided Single-modality Phenotype Associations", "text": "A risk genetic factor may affect multiple imaging QTs that are not all disease specific. We aim to discover only those imaging QTs associated with both the genetic factor and disease status, in order to have a better understanding of the biological pathway specific to the disease. In this study, we consider the relationship between imaging phenotypes and the diagnosis information which are not fully used in conventional imaging genetics methods. More specifically, we will utilize the subjects' diagnostic information, i.e., HC, SMC, EMCI, LMCI, or AD. If subjects are similar to each other in the original feature space, their respective response values (i.e., predicted genotype values) should be also similar. Figure 2 illustrates an example of embedding the diagnosis information (i.e., clinical status) from original data to the mapped data space. To address this issue, we induce a new regularization term that can preserve the class level diagnosis information: \nThe penalized term Eq. (3) enforces that, after being mapped into the label space, the distance between the within-class data will be small. The similarity between subjects within the same class can be defined as 1 if connected or 0 otherwise, which avoids the necessity of choosing hyperparameter compared to using heat kernel (Belkin and Niyogi 2003) . Equation (3) can be applied to an existing regression model (e.g., Eq. (2)) so that the mapping of the data into the label space will not only be determined by the regression model but also be regularized by Eq. (3). The goal of the Eq. (3) term is to encourage subjects from the same class to be close to each other in the label space.\nWith these observations, we induce the diagnosis labels constraint into the single modality phenotypic solution and then formulate the diagnosis-guided single modality (DGSM) phenotype association model as follows: The strength of DGSM method is that it explicitly models the priori diagnosis information among subjects in the objective function that minimizes distance within each diagnostic class for selecting the disease-relevant QTs associated with the SNP. Especially, the DGSM model can generalize and handle the progressive disease with multi-diagnosis status, comparing to the binary diagnosis analysis methods that were adopted in (Batmanghelich et al. 2013; Vounou et al. 2012 )."}, {"section_title": "Concatenating-modality Phenotype Associations", "text": "A common practice in data fusion is the concatenation of all features from different modalities into a longer feature vector, which may provide essential complementary information for this association study.

Furthermore, in order to investigate the relative contribution of each modality, we have extended weighted ensemble predictions denoted as DGMM (W-All). In our empirical study, we constrained the summation of individual weights was 1 and the optimal values were learned based on the training through a grid search using the range from 0 to 1 at a step of 0.1. The optimal weights have demonstrated that VBM and AV45 have larger contributions to the joint predictions. However, the contributed weight for each modality was not optimized from the objective function. Thus, it is an interesting future topic to apply our DGMM model to extend a one-step joint association framework considering the relative contribution of each modality.\nThird, as different imaging modalities can provide essential complementary information that can improve performances of accuracy, a lot of multi-modality based methods including concatenation and integrating among the feature level or other ensemble methods (Liu et al. 2012 ) such as kernel combination (Jie et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2011 ) and random forest (Gray et al. 2013 ) have been widely address the classification and prediction problem. However, our goal is to identify major ROIs whose multimodal measures can serve as intermediate traits, ignoring the diversity of the multi-modality phenotypes. We happen to induce existing multi-task learning aspect (Jie et al. 2015; Yuan and Lin 2006; Zhang and Shen 2012) for joint selecting the robust and consistent ROIs among different quantitative brain phenotypes for underlying the mechanisms of the disease. In order to balance the aspects of multi-modality phenotypic diversities and consistent ROIs selection in the association analysis above, we expect to use a more powerful model that can examine both individual (one ROI with certain modality phenotype) and shared features (the same ROIs among all modality phenotypes) of the different quantitative brain phenotypes to further improve our multimodal intermediate phenotypes identification. In the future work, we will address the above limitations for further improvement."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In summary, this study developed a diagnosis-guided multimodality (DGMM) framework for identifying neuroimaging quantitative phenotypes which can server as intermediate traits between a certain risk genetic factor and disease status. This approach explicitly utilized the priori diagnosis information among subjects in the objective function for selecting the most relevant multi-modality QTs associated with top risk SNP (i.e., APOE rs429358) in one step. The empirical experiments on the ADNI database showed that our method improved performances under the metrics of both correlation coefficient and root mean squared error compared with other competing methods. Specifically, the main contribution of this work was to identify a compact set of robust and consistent ROIs across the multimodal phenotypes (i.e., MRI-VBM, FDG-PET and AV45) to have a mechanistic understanding of AD biology. This general DGMM framework can be extended and applied to identify potential intermediate traits for genetic studies of other disorders."}, {"section_title": "Information Sharing Statement", "text": "Both the source code and documentation are available on request.
