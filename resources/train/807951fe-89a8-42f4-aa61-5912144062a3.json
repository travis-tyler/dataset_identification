[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "A recent f(JCUS in nearshore research has been large-scale coastal behavior (LSCB, THOJ{NTON et al., 2000), changes in nearshore hathymetry and beach topography with spatial scales of order kilometers and temporal scales of order years. It is at these scales that decisions are made in coastal zone management and at these scales that improvement to scientific understanding is needed. In order to accurately quantify the variability of large-scale coastal changes and to obtain a clearer understanding of the processes driving these changes, detailed measurement of large-scale morphology over regional scales is required. While change occurs over the entire active profile, the horizontal location and movement of the shoreline are two of the most commonly chosen variables of large-scale beach morphology and serve as direct indicators of erosion and accretion. Topographic maps IUSGS Quadrangles and NOS Topographic Sheets), rectified aerial photographs, and traditional beach profiles have been the most common source for long-term, large-scale measures of shoreline position (DOLAN 1'1 al., 19HO I. These historical shoreline locations are often compared to present shoreline locations to calculate rates of long-term shoreline chang\u00bb. Because of their long record length, maps O!06! rccciicc! ,() Muv :!OOf: \u00abccvpt,\u00ab! in recision 5 Fcbrua rv :!ltO:!. and aerial photographs are invaluahle Il1 quantifying longterm shoreline change."}, {"section_title": "Traditional Shoreline Proxies", "text": "Quantification of shoreline location, or the interface between the land and the water, usually involves a number of assumptions. Therefore, all estimates will have error associated with both the technique for measuring shoreline position and the assumptions made regarding the definition of the shoreline. Traditional methods using aerial photographs for shoreline measurement often involved non-stereo photography that has no vertical information. In this case, relationships must be assumed between some identifiable, horizontal feature and its assumed vertical elevation. For coastal change applications, the location of the high water line IHWL), defined as the landward extent of the last high tide (ANIlEI{S and BYI{NES, 1991;C!(()WELL ot al., 1991;DOLAN e! al., 19HO;STAFFOIUl, 1971), is commonly used to mark the position of the shoreline. Often the HWL may be difficult to identify or may appear as a gradational zone of change. Here, other physical features, such as the wet/dry line, (C!(()WELL ct al., 19911, vegetation line, drift line, or dune line (Motrro\u00bb, 19911 are used as a proxy for shoreline location. This leaves the determination of the location of this feature to t.he judgment of the operator IA\"IJI,: ItS and BYI{NES, 19911 and it may often be confused with the latest swash excursion, a debris line, an erosional scarp, or changes in sediment type or color (Cl{O\\VELL et al., 19911. Since the relationship of these proxies and an actual tidal datum 111ay vary depending on wave height, beach slope, storm surge, and sediment size (DOLAN ct til., 1980), errors can be potentially large and cannot be easily quantified."}, {"section_title": "Techniques for Identifying Shorelines", "text": "The earliest historical shorelines are available from maps dating back to the late 1800's (ANI>EHS and BYHNES, 1991). Topographic maps are most useful for cxarniniru; long-term trends in shoreline change since the maps are produced infrequently, limiting the amount of detail that can be obtained about short-term physical processes. Errors in shoreline location derived from maps may be attributed to surveyor error in identifying the shoreline feature, distortion of source maps (folding, tearing, shrinkage), and changes in the reference datum (ANDEHs and BYI{NES. 1991 L Since the 1920's, aerial photographs have been used to document shoreline position and change (ANDEI{S and BYl{NES, 1991 L Aerial photographs are first transformed to map coordinates using ground control points and then a proxy for the shoreline is digitized (CI{OWELL ct al., 1991). Aerial photographs were generally collected more frequently than maps were made and, therefore, may be used to develop a more detailed understanding of short-term shoreline variability. For unrectified aerial photographs, accuracy within or between images is limited by scale differences (caused by aircraft altitude changes), by camera geometry, by ground relief (CRO\\VELL et al.. 1991;DOLAN et ol., 1980;HAPKE and RICH-:YIOND, 2000), and by the precision of the digitizing equipment and of the operator in following the trace of the HWL (ANDERS and BYRNES, 1991l. Since the errors in measuring a shoreline from aerial photographs are not independent, cumulative errors may be large. CHOWELL et al. (1991) estimate the total (operational) combined error for 1:10,000 scale, non-tidal coordinated, aerial photography to be .~7.6 m, not including errors associated with inaccurate interpretation of the location of the HWL. Many of the errors associated with aerial photographs can be eliminated or reduced before features are identified within the image by using recent techniques involving softcopy photogrammetry where digital stereo images are used to georeference the image and remove distortion (HAPKE and RICH-MOND, 2000), Elevation contours are generated on the photograph through the creation of a digital terrain model and shoreline position, or a specified contour, can be measured from the stereo pair (OVEKI' ON and FISIlEI{, 1996). The accuracy of the extracted features depends on the known camera parameters, flight elevation, accuracy of ground control points, and the resolution of the image (HAPKE and RICH-:\\IOND, 2000). While the use of accurate digital images eliminates much of the error associated with aerial photographs, the process of identifying a shoreline and then extracting it from an image is very lahor intensive and makes the analysis of large areas more difficult. Shorelines have also ber-n rneasured from ground-hased surveys of cross-shore profiles of beach elevations. Si nee these surveys are relatively inexpensive to perform, closely spaced profiles can be collected frequently and used for detailed studies of short-term variation in shoreline change over a limited region (MoHToN, 1991 l. Whil\u00ab ground-has(\u2022d profiling techniques may yield an accurate muasure of xhorr-line location, the rneasurcments are spatially limited due to the intensive labor requirement of profi] ing. More rccc-ntlv. shoreline position has been measured using vchiclc-mou ntcd, ground-based GPS (global positioning system J surveys. AIlterrain vehicles equipped with C}PS antennae can quickly survey shore-parallel and shore-normal profiles (MO\\{TON ('( al., 1993), a single transect along the length of the beach ( 100 km or more in length) (LIST ct al., in press J, or a complete. detailed mapping of beach topography (4 km or mure in length) (PLANT et al., 1996;Ruc(;IEHO ct al., 1999;Rll(;(;II<:I{() and VOJ(;'!', 2000). Horizontal accuracy of shoreline positions measured using these techniques depends on, among other things, CPS accuracy, proximity of survey lines to the exact location of the shoreline, and beach slope. For example. using the vehicle-based mapping systems, on a beach with a 1:50 slope, the horizontal error in position is approximately 2.5 to 5.0 m (RUGGIERO et al., 1999). While the spatial coverage of the vehicle-based GPS ground surveys can be very extensive, it is still somewhat limited compared to the capabilities of an airborne system. Recent developments in GPS and scanning airborne laser capabilities have made available extensive data sets of fully threedimensional beach topography. These highly accurate and spatially dense surveys allow the possibility of rnaking an objective and detailed determination of regional-scale shoreline position. Using laser data to quantify shoreline position and change over regional scales will contribute to an improved understanding of large-scale coastal behavior on both long-term and short-term (storm) scales. Our objective is to develop a technique for measuring shoreline position from laser altimetry data. First, we describe the details of the lidar system and the lidar shoreline extraction technique. We then discuss the results of the ground truth test in the Outer Banks of North Carolina in September 1997. Additionally, the advantages and limitations of lidar data as a measure of large-scale shoreline position are illustrated through examination of three data sets of shoreline position collected at Assateague Island, Maryland/Virginia. Finally, we examine the statistics and longshore variability of the response of the island to the northeaster storm season of 1997-1998 using lidar-derived shorelines and beach slopes."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Airborne Topographic Mapper", "text": "NASA's Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) is a scanning laser altimeter originally developed to study climate change by mapping changes in the thickness of the Green land ice sheet (KI{ABILL et al., 1995).

The elevation of the total water level represents a maximum, not mean, total water level due to the superposition of wave crests. The 2fJr exceedence values for runup estimates, R:!((, were based on an empirical formulation of HOLMAN (1986), () is the Iribarren nurnber, and L() is the deep-water wavelength. Foreshore beach slope, f), was measured from each lidar profile. Data on wave height and period were obtained from NDBC station 44009 located outside of Delaware Bay. Tide data were obtained from NOAA tide gauge 8570283 located near Ocean City Inlet, Maryland. Wave heights and tide levels during the February 9, 1998 survey (H() = 3.0-2.5 m ) were both greater than that during the other two surveys (H()~0.7 m on September 15, 1997 and H;~LOrn on April 3, 1998). The total water elevation on February 9, 1998 during the lidar flight was 3.04 m, well above the elevation of MHW, 0.31 m NAVD88 (Figure 5b). Since the MHW datum was obscured in the February 9, 1998 data by elevated tide levels and large wave runup, z; extracted for the Assateague data set was 0.81 m (0.5 m above MHW), which still lies on the acti ve foreshore of the beach. Shorelines were calculated from all three data sets along the 60 km stretch of beach at profiles spaced 10 111 in the longshore. (The 10 m spacing was selected for a different application of the data in which smaller scale shoreline features were studied.) Figure 6 illustrates two example profiles from Septernber 1997 and February 1998. The large scatter seaward of x = 550 m is due to the reflection of the laser off of the water's surface. Since data passes are combined, the surface appears more like noise than actual waves. Along this profile, a well-defined berm was completely eroded and the shoreline recessed 32.4 \u00b1 0.8 m. Shoreline change was computed for all 5730 profiles between September 1997 and February 1998 ( Figure 7, black line) to examine the spatial variability of the response of the beach to the extreme storm events on January 28, 1998 and February 5, 1998. Error bars, indicating the 95(lr confidence interval about each estimate of shoreline change, were calculated as the rms of the combined variance of the two individual measures of shoreline position. The mean shoreline change indicates approximately 28.6 \u00b1 0.02 m of erosion: however, there is substantial spatial variability in the data (standard deviation of shoreline change, (f(~x), = 16.2 m l, ranging from nearly no net change to a maximum of~150 m of erosion. The shoreline position calculated from the April 1998 data set shows that the post-storm beach had started to recover to the pre-storm conditions (Figure 7, gray line). The mean shoreline change during this two-month recovery period was approximately 13.5 \u00b1 0.02 m of accretion (f(~x) = 11.0 m ). Both storm and recovery curves of shoreline change show the frequency drift inherent in both the ATM and SWASH GPS systems. This low-frequency drift is specific to GPS systems, in general, and is not particularly well understood or documerited. Based on a mean GPS drift of 8.7 cm and a mean beach slope of 0.08, the site-specific, horizontal error attributable to low frequency drift is on the order of \u00b1 1 m. (This horizontal GPS drift error is separate from the system noise error discussed above.) Since the GPS drift error has been realized just recently, the amount of drift at different sites generally will not be known. Several tests of stationary GPS systems (separate from the lidar GPS equipment) have been performed in different parts of the country and reveal a low frequency vertical drift of 6 to 8 cm over an hour period (SAL-LENCEI{ et al., in press). Based on this estimate, we feel the 1 m horizontal drift error is a conservative estimate and may be smaller in some locations. The total vertical accuracy of the ATM system (15 cm ) is a bulk estimate representing all potential error sources, including this GPS drift (SALLEN-(;EH et al., in press). Details of the comparisons between the raw data points and of the GPS drift can be found in SALLEN- (;EI{ et al. (in press) and KRABILL et al. (in press). The vertical offset between the raw ATM and SWASH data contains a trend that decreases to the north. In the southern region of the study area~ZIJ = 12 em while in the northern region~ZIJ 2 CITI. In order to examine the robustness of the technique and the ideal, expected error in the absence ofGPS low frequency drift, the longshore trend in vertical differences due to the drift was removed from the lidar elevation data. The corrected X,,_aill/yJ was then compared to x\"~\"II({\"I,(Y) which, for our ground truth study, represents the 'real' shoreline position. The corrected lidar-derived shoreline position closely agrees with the SWASH-derived shoreline with an rms differenco, (~x)\"/II'\" of 1.49; however it is still somewhat seaward of'the SWASH shoreline;~x\" = 0.44 m. Reasons for this seaward bias are explained above."}, {"section_title": "Application to Shoreline Change", "text": "The technique for extracting shoreline position from lidar profiles was applied to laser altimetry data collected on Assatcague Island in 1997 and 1998. Assateague Island is an undeveloped stretch of barrier island along the eastern shore of Maryland and Virginia (Figure 2, upper right). The moderately straight coastline is marked by areas of relatively high dunes alternating with low-lying areas that are frequently overwashed during large storm events. Shoreline position was measured over 60 km of coast from three lidar data sets. The first was collected on September 15, 1997 (1600-1900 G-MT) before the start of the winter storm season. The second overflight was on February 9, 1998 (1600-1900 GMT), after the passage of two major northeaster storms where maximum wave heights exceeded 7 m (SALLENCER et al., 1999a). Two months later on April 3,1998 (2200-2300 GMT), a third survey was conducted that documented the initial recovery stage for the island.
