This paper finds that, contrary to expectations, the revenue product analyzed is uniformly superior to yield insurance under both current (2002) and proposed (2008) Farm Bill structures of government payments.

Over the years, the support programs have been updated through a series of legislative acts commonly known as farm bills. Most recently, the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 modified some of the provisions of the farm payment program and introduced counter-cyclical farm income support. For the duration of the 2002 Farm Bill (2002 , eligible crop producers were receiving (fixed) direct payments (DPs) as well as loan deficiency payments (LDPs) and counter-cyclical payments (CCPs), which provided protection against low commodity prices. Several programs from the previous farm bills, in particular yield and revenue insurance as well as LDPs, will be continued in the new bill under the Producer Income Protection Title. From the risk management perspective, the most significant changes introduced in the legislation are the revenue-based CounterCyclical Payments (RCCPs) in the House version and Average Crop Revenue (ACR) program in the Senate version. Additional minor changes include a lower ceiling on received DPs and the end of the $75,000 limit on LDPs.\nThe RCCP proposal gives the producers a one-time option to select into a revenue-based CCP program for the entire duration of the new Farm Bill (2008 Bill ( -2012 instead of the price-based CCP made available in the 2002 Farm Bill (Shurley and Smith) . The current CCP program remains the default choice for producers who fail to signal their intentions. The primary difference between the CCP and RCCP programs is that whereas CCPs are determined by the target and seasonal (actual) market prices, RCCPs are triggered when a defined measure of the national average revenue for a given crop drops below a predetermined target revenue for that crop.\nThe Senate version of the bill gives producers the option to select the ACR program as a replacement for both DPs and CCPs. ACR consists of two parts: a fixed component (essentially a revised DP) and a revenue component (a replacement of CCP). The fixed component is a fixed per acre payment rate applied to 85% of base acres. 1 The revenue component of ACR is a payment made when the state-level average revenue, based on the harvest price, is less than the ACR program guarantee revenue. ACR is therefore similar to RCCP in that it replaces the current price-based CCP program with a revenue-based payment program.\nIn addition to the government payment programs, crop producers have access to government-subsidized insurance products administered by the Risk Management Agency (RMA). The most popular among those are Multiple-Peril Crop Insurance (MPCI) and Crop Revenue Coverage (CRC) programs. MPCI-also referred to as actual production history (APH) or yield insurance-provides protection against production risk, while CRC protects producers against cumulative revenue shortfall due to any unfavorable combination of yields and prices. 2 The choice of agricultural insurance coverage has been extensively studied in the literature. Relevant to the present study are two areas of inquiry. The first is concerned with the factors that explain the qualitative choice of a particular program among several alternatives, for instance revenue insurance as opposed to yield insurance. The second addresses the questions of under what conditions and to what extent do government support payments duplicate the safety net features of insurance products.\nUsing a survey of Midwestern corn and soybean farmers, Sherrick et al. find that insurance demand (particularly for revenue insurance) increases with leverage, risk, and farm size but decreases with wealth. Revenue insurance users tend to be younger, less experienced, more highly leveraged, and also tend to farm a greater number of acres, a smaller proportion of which they own. Determinants of revenue insurance demand differ from those of yield insurance. While the use of revenue insurance is increasing in farm size, debt-to-asset ratio, and in the importance given to risk management strategies, the use of yield insurance is decreasing in all of these factors.\nThe difference in the determinants of participation in revenue insurance versus yield insurance is also analyzed by Mishra and Goodwin using 1998 farm-level data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS). They find that government payments positively affect the yield insurance decision but not the revenue insurance decision, while conversely the value of production positively affects the revenue insurance but not the yield insurance decision. Education level, farm size, and tenure type also explain well the adoption of revenue insurance but not yield insurance.\nRevenue insurance programs appear to be more efficient and less costly to taxpayers than are traditional agricultural support programs (Gray, Richardson, and McClasky; Harwood et al.; Hennessey, Babcock, and Hayes) . In addition, revenue insurance programs appear to have lower administrative costs (Skees et al.) .\nA related issue is whether the choice of insurance products is affected by other gov-1 In contrast, direct payment is calculated as a fixed payment rate per unit of crop weight multiplied by a preset yield and also applied to 85% of base acres.\n2 This is certainly not an exhaustive list of insurance products available to the crop producers. A detailed description of various insurance programs can be found, for example, at the Risk Management Agency's website at http://www.rma.usda.gov. ernment payments. Makki and Somwaru find that crop (yield) insurance is widely perceived by recipients as an income supplement (i.e., subsidy). Hauser, Sherrick, and Schnitkey report that yield insurance but not revenue insurance is strongly negatively correlated with CCP.\nHow exactly indemnities of insurance payments are related to government payments is not a trivial question. For instance, revenue insurance is affected by both price and yield conditions but counter-cyclical payments are not, so that the two are not substitutes, contrary to the perceptions of many producers. At the same time, the structure of government payments closely resembles payoffs of market price risk management instruments such as options. In particular, loan deficiency payments can be interpreted as free put options with the strike equal to the marketing loan rate (Figure 1 ) and thus can be considered as substitutes for futures and options hedging (Coble, Heifner, and Zuniga; Mahul) .\nSimilarly, the payoff structure of CCP can be interpreted as a put option bear spread (Skully and Plato) . The bear spread is an option strategy that guarantees a payoff up to a certain level whenever the price of the underlying asset drops below the predetermined level (Figure 2 ).\nRevenue insurance is often seen as a better choice to manage revenue risk as it protects producers from revenue shortfalls regardless of whether they are caused by low prices or low yields. However, if realizations of prices and yields are relatively independent, then managing price and yield risk separately would have an overall effect similar to that achieved by using revenue insurance.\nThe main goal of this paper is to investigate the hypothesis that such government payment programs as LDP and CCP-which in effect act as costless or fully subsidized price insurance-combined with yield insurance may be a viable alternative to revenue insurance, at least in the case of crops and geographic regions for which yields and prices are relatively uncorrelated.\nMore specifically, we analyze the riskreducing effectiveness of APH insurance as opposed to CRC in the presence of government payments. Furthermore, we also investigate potential changes in the relative risk effectiveness of these contracts under the proposals of the 2007 Farm Bill, which essentially replace the price-based CCP program with a revenue-based one. A secondary contribution made at the theoretical level is the application of a copula approach to model the joint distributions of prices and yields. The copula approach allows for a more flexible and accurate representation of dependence between random variables compared with more restrictive assumptions, such as multivariate normality.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section presents a theoretical framework for the evaluation of revenues under different combinations of government payments and insurance contracts as well as the expected utility approach to compare risky alternatives. This is followed by a section that describes the modeling methodology (including a copula approach) and the data used in the analysis. The results are presented and discussed next. The last section provides concluding remarks."}, {"section_title": "Theoretical Framework", "text": "We assume a representative farmer receives revenue from the sale of crops on the spot market and collects government program payments, if applicable.

In addition, the ACR and RCCP proposals of the 2007 Farm Bill are considered. We further assume that the producer may purchase one of two primary insurance products-APH or CRC.

APH pays out when actual yield is less than a stated guaranteed yield. The latter equals the APH yield 4 times the producerchosen coverage level, g APH , which ranges from 50% to 85% in 5% increments. The APH per acre payment equals the yield shortfall multiplied by the indemnity price, which is selected by the farmer as 60% to 100% of the price established by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC). Overall,\nCrop Revenue Coverage CRC is the most widely available revenue insurance contract. It provides insurance against low yields, low prices, or both. An indemnity is paid if the actual gross revenue is less than the revenue guarantee. Furthermore, a majority of the CRC contracts are purchased with the harvest price option, which allows for calculation of the revenue guarantee using the larger of planting time and harvest time prices.

These include farm-level yield, y, harvest cash price, p, marketing year average price, p MYA , CRC harvest price, p Harv , realized average national yield, y US , and realized state average yield, y State . If a number of realizations of these variables are generated, a Monte Carlo approach can then be used to calculate the expected utilities of final wealth in Equations (8a-c).\nThe variables of interest have to be simulated based on historical data, with an emphasis placed on preserving the joint dependence structure between yields and prices. However, estimation of a full joint distribution of six variables is a challenging task complicated by the shortness of available data series and by distortions introduced by the agricultural policies.\nA common approach in the literature is to impose observed price-yield correlations on generated price and yield series, therefore essentially to model the price-yield relationship as a multivariate normal distribution (e.g., Coble, Heifner, and Zuniga). Farm-level yields are typically modeled as a parametric distribution around parametric or nonparametric distributions of county-level yields (e.g., Ker and Goodwin; Schnitkey, Sherrick, and Irwin; Vedenov et al.) . However, these approaches may impose rather strict and not always realistic assumptions. An alternative methodology for modeling joint distributions that provides more flexibility and that relies on less restrictive assumptions is a copula approach. Copulas are widely used in the financial literature (e.g., Cherubini, Luciano, and Vecchiato) but generally have not found their way yet into the agricultural economics literature."}, {"section_title": "Overview of Copulas", "text": "The following presentation is based on Nelsen, which provides a more thorough treatment of the subject. Generally speaking, a copula may be described as a function relating a joint distribution and its marginals. In a twodimensional case, a copula is defined as a function v 1 ) . 0. Any copula function by itself represents a joint distribution of two random variables with uniform marginal distributions on [0, 1].\nSklar's Theorem states that any continuous joint cumulative density function F(x, y) 5 Pr{X # x, Y # y} is related to its marginal density functions F x (x)5 Pr{X # x} and F y (y) 5 Pr{Y # y} through a unique copula function C F (?, ?) such that F(x, y) 5 C F (F x (x), F y (y)). Conversely, any copula function C(?, ?) applied to the cumulative density functions of any two random variables F x (x) 5 Pr{X # x} and F y (y) 5 Pr{Y # y} generates a cumulative density function F C (x, y) 5 C(F x (x), F y (y)) of x and y with the marginals F x (x) and F y (y). The latter property allows estimation of joint distributions given marginal CDFs of variables of interest and a choice of a copula. The selected copula function describes the dependence structure between the random variables without the need to explicitly specify the functional form of the joint CDF (Chen and Huang) .\nA copula approach can be applied to Monte Carlo analysis in a relatively straightforward fashion. Given an n-dimensional copula function C n (u 1 , u 2 , \u2026, u n ) and a vector of n marginal CDFs {F 1 , F 2 , \u2026, F n } of random variables {x 1 , x 2 , \u2026, x n }, the following method can be used to generate random draws from the joint distribution F C (x 1 , x 2 , \u2026, x n ) of these variables implied by the copula (Cherubini, Luciano, and Vecciato). First, the required number N of random draws of vectors {u 1 , u 2 , \u2026, u n } N i51 are generated from the copula itself. Second, each generated vector is transformed using the inverse CDFs {F 1 , F 2 , \u2026, F n }. The resulting random vectors\nare the desired random draws from F C (x 1 , x 2 , \u2026, x n ). The choice of a copula itself is a nontrivial matter, since there are an infinite number of functions satisfying copula conditions. Several functional forms for copulas have been used in the financial literature. The Gaussian copula, which corresponds to the joint multivariate normal distribution, is especially popular and can be used when the dependence structure between the random variables is elliptical (Nelsen) . An alternative approach is to use a nonparametric empirical kernel copula, which is related to multivariate kernel density distributions (Wand and Jones) . The advantage of the kernel copula is that it imposes no assumptions on the dependence structure between the random variables, but rather determines it from the data. We use both Gaussian and empirical kernel density copulas to generate the random draws required for the analysis. "}, {"section_title": "Simulation Approach", "text": "Historical data are available for national, state, and county yields, as well as for cash, MYA, and futures prices for major commodities. Yield series in some cases go as far back as 70-80 years. Price series are generally available for up to 40 years. However, farmlevel yield series are usually much shorter and rarely extend past 10-15 years. Given the data limitations, estimating a marginal distribution of yields for a single farm would be unrealistic. Instead, a representative farm in a given county was modeled. Since county data series are usually longer and more reliable, we used all available farm-level yield series for a given county to calculate farm-level shocks relative to the realized county yield. The marginal distributions of national, state, and county yields and farm-level shocks were then estimated from the historical data using the nonparametric kernel density approach (Ker and Goodwin; Wand and Jones) .\nFollowing Coble, Heifner, and Zuniga, we assumed that the local cash prices, p, and the marketing year average prices, p MYA , are driven by the harvest-time futures prices f 1 , which are also used by the RMA to determine the CRC harvest price, p Harv . Therefore, we modeled p and p MYA as\nwhere the residual terms are independent shocks with zero mean and appropriate variance. Furthermore, we modeled the harvest-time futures price f 1 as a log-normally distributed shock applied to the (known) planting time futures price f 0 so that\nFinally, since the futures markets are national in scope, we assumed that the dependence structure present in the historical data on national yields and harvest time futures prices adequately represents the relationship between yields and prices.\nThe necessary realizations of yields and prices were then generated in several steps. First, a Gaussian copula was used to generate draws from the joint distribution of d ln f and national yields y US . That is, the inverse lognormal CDF and inverse kernel-density CDF, respectively, were applied to the pairs of random draws generated from the Gaussian copula. 8 The generated realizations of d ln f 7 The issue of the optimal copula selection is outside of the scope of this paper.

The cash price, p, and MYA price, p MYA , were generated according to Equation (9) with additional random shocks drawn from the normal distributions implied by the regressions in Equation (9).\nAt the second step, a similar procedure was applied to generate realizations of state and county yields conditional on the national yields generated at the first step. In particular, the inverse kernel density marginal CDFs of the corresponding yield distributions were applied to the random draws from a threedimensional kernel copula derived from the historical data on national, state, and county yields and conditional on the previously generated national yields.\nFinally, realizations of farm-level yields, y, were generated using a two-dimensional kernel copula derived from the historical data on farm-level and county-level yields and conditional on the realizations of county yields generated at the second step.\nOnce the realizations of all the relevant variables were generated, the payoffs of government payment programs and insurance contracts in Equations (2-7) could be evaluated and the expected utility of the final wealth for each scenario in Equations (8a-c) calculated."}, {"section_title": "Data and Parameterization", "text": "For the purpose of the present paper, corn production was compared in Iowa and Texas. Iowa is the largest corn-growing state in the country and tends to have yields that are highly correlated with national prices. Corn production in Texas is on a much smaller scale and, as a consequence, yields are less closely related to prices. It was therefore hypothesized that the risk-reducing effectiveness of APH insurance combined with government payments (DP, LDP, CCP) may be comparable with, if not superior to, that of CRC in Texas, but not necessarily in Iowa. Representative farms were assumed to be located in Kossuth County, Iowa, and Jackson County, Texas. Both counties are among the largest corn-producing counties in their respective states. Each representative farm was assumed to consist of 100 acres, all of which were treated as base acres for the purposes of government payments. Initial wealth w 0 was set to $50,000.\nFarm-level yield data for Kossuth County, Iowa, (743 observations) and Jackson County, Texas (49 observations), from 1980 to 1994 were obtained from an RMA data set. County-, state-, and national-level yields from 1968 trough 2006 were collected from the National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS). Farm-level data were converted to multiplicative shocks relative to the corresponding county yields. For county, state, and national yields, a simple log-linear trend was fitted to each series and all observations were converted to multiplicative shocks relative to the trend. The year 2006 was selected as a base (trend) year, since it was the latest year for which all data were available.\nFutures prices for December corn contracts from 1969 through 2007 were obtained from the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). Following the RMA procedures (RMA 2003) , February average futures prices were used as the CRC base price, p CRC , as well as a proxy for the planting-time futures prices f 0 , while October average futures prices were used as the CRC harvest price, p Harv , as well as a proxy for the harvest-time futures prices f 1 . Normality of the log-difference of futures prices d ln f could not be rejected at the 92% confidence level, therefore the sample mean and standard deviation of the data series for d ln f were used as parameters of the normal distribution in (10).\nCash prices were approximated by the average October prices received by producers in corresponding states. 9 These and market year average prices from 1968 to 2007 were also obtained from NASS. Both data series were regressed on d ln f in order to determine the parameters in Equation (9). The information on and selected statistics of historical data series are summarized in Table 1 . Note that the detrended county yields and log-difference in futures prices exhibit much stronger negative correlation for Kossuth County, Iowa, than they do for Jackson County, Texas. Furthermore, the cash price basis in Texas is much higher than in Iowa, where national prices tend to be tracked quite closely. Parameters of the government payments and insurance programs for the base year (2006) were obtained from the RMA and Farm Service Agency (FSA) websites (FSA; RMA 2007) . For simplicity's sake, both DP and CCP yields were set to the corresponding 1998-2001 yield averages. Details on the proposed RCCP and ACR programs were obtained from Shurley and Smith and applied to the base year. APH price election was set to 100%. Actual premiums for APH and CRC insurance contracts for various coverage levels were obtained using the RMA premium calculator and county-specific information for 2006. The parameters of government programs are summarized in Table 2 .\nFor the analysis, 20,000 random draws of all relevant variables were generated following the procedure described above. The generated results were then used to calculate the expected utility of final wealth for different scenarios and coverage levels. A CRRA power utility function\nwas used for the expected utility analysis. Following Babcock, Choi, and Feinerman, the risk aversion parameter c was selected so as to represent the risk premium a producer would be willing to forgo in order to replace a risky payoff with its expected value. More specifically, for a given risk premium h and a risky payoff x, the corresponding parameter c of the utility function was determined from the condition\nRisk premiums were set to 0% (riskneutrality), 5%, and 10%, and the net wealth without any form of government support was used as the reference risky payoff in Equation (11). The corresponding levels of risk aversion c are summarized in Table 3 . Note that the same risk premium corresponds to a higher level of risk aversion for Iowa than for Texas, which reflects higher risk associated with crop production in Texas. 10 Table 4 are the maximum achievable levels of certainty-equivalent wealth for APH and CRC contracts in the presence of government payments under the provisions of the 2002 Farm Bill.

That the risk-neutral producer (risk premium of 0%) would select a coverage level 10 Intuitively, a producer must be less risk averse to forego the same portion of certain revenue when presented with higher risk than when presented with lower risk. higher than the minimum is explained by the fact that the insurance premiums are not actuarially fair, although in Texas this effect is not nearly as pronounced as it is in Iowa. For a risk-averse producer, CRC turns out to be a more efficient risk management instrument in both the Iowa and Texas counties analyzed. While the result for Iowa is as expected, the dominance of CRC in Texas is contrary to our hypothesis. However, the performance of APH is much closer to that of CRC for Texas than for Iowa.\nA possible explanation of this result may be the discrepancy between the APH and CRC contract prices. The former is established by the FCIC and does not change during the growing season. The CRC base price is based on the planting-time futures prices and may further increase during the growing season. In the base year (2006), the established APH price was $2.00/bu, while the CRC base price was $2.59/ bu in Iowa and $2.38 in Texas (Table 2) . To verify this conjecture, we ran simulations over a (counterfactual) range of higher APH prices, p APH , between $2.05/bu and $2.50/bu. The results of this analysis are presented in Table 5 as well as in Figures 5 and 6 for the case of a 10% risk premium.\nFor Iowa, APH does not catch up to CRC even for the established APH price set at $2.50/bu. For Texas, on the other hand, there is a range of reasonable contract prices at which APH matches or even dominates CRC. Specifically, APH becomes competitive with CRC at the APH price of p APH 5 $2.20/bu and dominates it at any coverage level at p APH Table 6 and in Figure 7 .\nThe results in Figure 7 show that the RCCP proposal improves the risk-reducing effectiveness of both APH and CRC regardless of location. On the other hand, ACR improves the effectiveness of both contracts in Texas but actually reduces their effectiveness in Iowa, particularly for high coverage levels. This suggests that the ACR program may replicate insurance contracts in high yieldprice correlation areas.
