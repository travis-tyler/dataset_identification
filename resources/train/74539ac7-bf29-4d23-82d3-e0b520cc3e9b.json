[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The impact of the Great Recession was widespread, with unemployment rates doubling for nearly all subgroups of the population. Recent college graduates, whose unemployment rate increased from 9% in 2007 to a peak of 17.6% in 2009, were no exception. 1 Research on previous recessions suggests this group will experience signicant earnings losses over their careers, relative to their luckier counterparts who graduated just before or just after the recession. 2 Research also suggests that college graduates face sizeable earnings dierences depending on their eld of study. 3 It is natural to then ask whether, and how, earnings dierences across eld of study interact with the business cycle. What kinds of students are most prone to the impacts of entry conditions? Does an engineering student, who typically earns 75% more than an education major, retain or even expand that advantage when graduating into a recession? Or, does the general lack of opportunity compress these earnings dierences? Why might recent graduates be particularly sensitive to economic conditions? Workers graduating into a recession will likely match to lower level starting jobs than their luckier counterparts (Devereux 2002). Highly mobile young workers (Topel and Ward 1992) may recover from early set-backs through job movement, though perhaps more gradually in the face of fewer vacancies per worker. However, a poor early start, possibly including time spent in unemployment, could put college graduates in jobs with fewer training and promotion opportunities, resulting in a lasting disadvantage."}, {"section_title": "4", "text": "Why might the eects of economic conditions at graduation depend on eld of study? College majors dier widely in the skill requirements of their degrees and subsequent jobs, 2 Kahn (2010) estimates that white men graduating in the worst part of the 1981-82 recession earned over 20% less, relative to those graduating in nearby peaks, and these eects partially persisted for [15][16][17][18][19][20] years. Oreopoulos, von Wachter, and Heisz (2012) nd somewhat similar eects on men in Canada over a twenty-year period, though magnitudes and persistence are weaker. They also nd impacts are worse for lower-skilled college graduates. 3 For example, Altonji, Blom, and Meghir (2012) show that earnings dierences across college majors can be as large as the overall college-high school premium. They provide a survey of the literature on the returns to college major. 4 Though the literature on the career eects of entry conditions is sparse on underlying mechanisms, Kahn (2010) suggests that human capital disparities are a likely driver. Consistent with this notion, eects are typically worse for higher human capital individuals for whom post-schooling skill accumulation is likely more important. For example, college graduates face larger, more persistent impacts than do high school graduates; white men experience worse wage outcomes than women and minorities (see Kondo (2008) and Hershbein (2012)). Human capital disparities across cohorts arise in Gibbons and Waldman's (2006) task-specic human capital model where workers entering rms in worse economies start out in lower level jobs and therefore lag behind on task-specic human capital in more important jobs years later. The Gibbons-Waldman model was designed to explain (among other things) persistent earnings dierences across rm-entry cohorts found in Baker, Gibbs, and Holmstrom (1994). In contrast Beaudry and DiNardo (1991) show that while labor market conditions at point of entry into a rm matter, the best labor market over a worker's tenure matters most for earnings. They posit this is driven by bargaining and imperfect mobility. as well as their labor market opportunities in good times. 5 These dierences could result in a dierential ability to nd good initial placements, which could lead to better career trajectories or help avoid path dependence and earnings losses that come from time spent outside of full-time work (Kroft, Lange, and Notowidigdo (2013), Bertrand, Goldin, and Katz (2010)). Ability dierences might also translate into a dierential ability to upgrade from poor initial placements. 6 It is also likely that training opportunities and skill appreciation will be more important for career paths in some majors than in others. For high-return majors, post-schooling human capital accumulation might be more important (though this is actually an open question), yielding more scope for negative impacts of entry conditions. Will a general higher ability of high-return majors help them weather an early downturn, or will a potential for greater mismatch between the degree and opportunities for skill accumulation and advancement in initial job placements cause relatively worse outcomes? In this paper, we analyze the short-and medium-term career outcomes of college graduates as a function of economic conditions at graduation and college major. The data requirements are formidable. We combine seven data sets with information on earnings and eld of study for U.S. college graduates graduating between 1974 and 2011. The combined data set yields coverage of multiple business cycles and features larger sample sizes than the typical cohort-based analyses in this literature. We characterize 51 college majors by the average earnings premium in the major. We then estimate impacts of graduating in times of higher unemployment across these skill groups for a range of labor market outcomes over the rst 13 years of a career. We address three main questions. First, what is the eect of graduating into a recession for the average college major? We improve on previous research by examining this question over a long time period in the U.S. with multiple expansions and recessions. Second, how does the eect of a recession vary by college major? Third, have the answers to these questions changed in the Great Recession? Consistent with the previous literature, we nd that graduating from college in times of higher unemployment is associated with signicant earnings losses for the average major. 7 Earnings decline by roughly 10% in the rst year after graduation for a worker who graduated with a four percentage point higher unemployment rate (the increase seen in a 5 For example, Turner and Bowen (1999) show substantial variation in average SAT scores across college major, and Arcidiacono (2004) and Altonji et al. (2012) show that the ordering of majors by average earnings is very similar to the ordering by average SAT math score. 6 Shimer (2004) points out that the expected return to job search will positively impact search intensity, and Oreopoulos et al. (2012) view their nding that in Canada, more-skilled graduates catch up more quickly from poor initial conditions as supporting a model of dierential search intensity. Furthermore, Wozniak (2010) nds that geographic location choices of college graduates are more sensitive to local labor market conditions than are those of high school graduates, supporting the idea that higher-skilled workers search more intensively. large recession). This eect partially persists for the rst several years of a career, averaging to a roughly 1.8% earnings loss per year over the rst 10 years. This result is similar to Oreopoulos et al.'s (2012) estimate but smaller and less persistent than Kahn's (2010). We then examine the channels through which recessions aect labor market outcomes, focusing on employment, full-time status, wage rates, and occupational attainment. We nd that the earnings losses are accounted for by a combination of hours reductions and wage rate reductions. We nd only modest impacts on the probability of being employed but larger impacts on the probability of working full-time. Workers are about 5 percentage points less likely to be working full time in their rst year out of college, though this eect does not persist past the rst three years after graduation. Wages are 4% lower in the rst year after graduating into a large recession, and average about 1.5% per year over the rst 10 years. We also nd small negative impacts on occupation quality, as measured by the earnings return to the occupation, but no eect on occupation match quality, as measured by whether the occupation is typical for one's major. Regarding the second question, we nd that those in high-paying majors are somewhat sheltered from the negative eects of graduating into a recession. A major that typically earns one standard deviation above the mean (such as civil engineering or accounting) experiences only about half the earnings losses of a major that typically earns at the mean (journalism or engineering technology). This means that high-return majors increase their earnings advantage by almost a third when graduating into a large recession, and this eect persists for 7 years into a career. By the same token, those in elds that typically earn one standard deviation below the mean (tness and nutrition, commercial art and design) experience earnings losses that are about 50 percent larger than those of the average major. The dierential earnings eect across college majors is due to a combination of dierential eects on wages, employment, occupational attainment, and hours. For example, highearning majors increase their wage advantage by 15% when graduating into a large recession, and this eect persists for several years. Occupations also seem to be an important margin for the dierential eects. Higher earning majors are dierentially more likely to be in higher paying occupations and in occupations that are typical for their major. the probability of attaining an advanced degree and nd small positive eects for those graduating into a recession. These eects are muted for higher-skilled majors, consistent with the relative changes in opportunity costs. This represents the broadest evidence to date on the subject of graduate educational attainment. It is possible that the relative advantage of higher-skilled majors graduating into a recession is driven by a dierential cyclicality in their labor demand. 10 To examine this mechanism, we construct and analyze the cyclicality of a major-specic unemployment rate; this is the rst such analysis to our knowledge. We use annual Current Population Survey data and the industry-occupation distribution for each major from a subset of our data to construct the unemployment rate in the industry-occupation cells that a given major tends to enter into. We indeed nd a negative correlation between skill level and cyclicality of the major-specic unemployment rate, but it is small. A one standard deviation increase in skill level of the major reduces its cyclicality by only 10%, relative to the average major. The nal set of results concerns those who graduated into the Great Recession of 2007-09. First, we present evidence that 2004-2011 graduates saw much larger per-unit impacts of the aggregate unemployment rate on earnings between two and three times the size of the earlier period. We document that these changes are associated with a large increase in the cyclicality of demand for college graduates. Second, the relative advantage of high-skilled majors graduating into a recession has been cut in half. This may be due in part to an increase in cyclicality of demand for high-skilled majors relative to the average major, although this is probably only part of the story. Therefore, it appears that the Great Recession was much harsher overall for recent graduates than we would have expected given the size of the aggregate unemployment rate increase, and these eects were more evenly distributed across majors. Our work is most closely related to Oreopoulos et al. (2012), who use Canadian universityemployer-employee matched data to study the earnings eects of graduating in times of higher unemployment, and how these eects vary with the skill level of the graduate. They nd smaller and less persistent eects for workers who went to better schools, majored in more dicult subjects, and received better grades. They nd that these groups are able to catch up more quickly through upgrading on rm quality. Our result that higher-skilled majors fare relatively better when graduating into a worse economy is entirely consistent with their work. We oer the rst results on this question for the United States, and provide an analysis over a long time horizon with large sample sizes. We also measure a number of other outcomes, such as employment, wage rates and occupational and educational attainment, that were unavailable in the administrative data set used by Oreopoulos et al. (2012). Though we cannot measure rm quality in our data, we use occupation earnings dierentials college attendance as a function of local labor market conditions. and the propensity to be in a popular occupation given one's major to assess the quality of jobs workers enter into over the business cycle and across college major. This paper proceeds as follows. We discuss our data sources and some measurement issues in section 2 before describing methodology in section 3. Section 4 presents our core results on earnings, wages, employment, and occupational and educational attainment for the average graduate and discusses how these results have changed for graduates in recent years, including the Great Recession. Section 5 examines dierential eects across major, including an examination of the eects of recessions and college major on graduate education. Section 6 examines demand cyclicality across college majors as a potential explanation for our results. Section 7 concludes."}, {"section_title": "Data 2.1 Data Sources", "text": "In order to estimate the short-and medium-term eects of initial economic conditions on labor market outcomes across college major, with coverage over several national expansions and contractions, we pool multiple data sources: two National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth "}, {"section_title": "11", "text": "These surveys are chosen because they contain information on both college major and labor market outcomes. To better align the length of time individuals can be observed postcollege graduation across data sets, we restrict attention to workers between ages 22 and 35 and those who are between 0 and 13 years out of college. 12 The pooled data contain college graduates who graduated between 1974 and 2011, with an unbalanced panel of labor market outcomes measured from 1977 to 2012. 13 Appendix table 1 reports this coverage by survey. We provide a description of each survey and details of specic variable creation in the online data appendix.\nWe do not use the 1985 SIPP panel, which does not have college major information, or the 1989 SIPP panel, which was abandoned and did not produce enough follow-up waves to be useable. 12 We also exclude workers who graduated before age 20 or after age 24 (roughly a quarter of graduates in surveys where we can determine timing of college graduation). We feel it is appropriate to restrict attention to a sample that more closely represents the typical student. In all surveys but the ACS, we know or can infer year of college graduation. For the ACS, we take advantage of quarter of birth information to impute graduation year as the year an individual was likely age 22 in May of that year, the most common graduation age in the other data sets. 13 Though we also have data on college graduates from 1971-73, the samples are small in those years, and are therefore lost when we apply cell-size restrictions, described below. The goal in this paper is to estimate the impacts of entry conditions on subsequent labor market outcomes. We use the census division unemployment rate in the year of college graduation as an indicator of entry conditions, hereafter U c . The subscript c stands for the college graduation cohort, which we dene as a division-graduation year. 14 The unemployment rate is highly visible and is the most commonly used measure of economic conditions in prior work (see, for example, Kahn (2010) and Oreopoulos et al. (2012))."}, {"section_title": "15", "text": "To provide a sense of sample coverage, appendix table 2 presents the number of observations in the pooled sample by U c and years since graduation (hereafter potential experience). We have substantial sample sizes at both low and high levels of unemployment. However, the pooled data are heavily skewed towards low graduation-year unemployment rates. This is because the ACS is much larger than the other data sets and its graduates tend to be from low unemployment years (with the exception of the most recent graduates from these surveys, who graduated into the Great Recession). This feature of our data leads us to employ a two-step estimation procedure, described in more detail below, that allows us to put equal weight on each cohort-potential experience cell. With this approach we can characterize the overall impact of graduating into a period of high unemployment across the long time period spanned by our data sets. Estimates from an unweighted sample would instead primarily reect the recent period.

Below, and in the data appendix, we describe our eorts to create a uniform data set, despite these dierences. We also provide a companion analysis using the Current Population Survey March Supplement (CPS). The main advantage of the CPS is that it provides fairly uniform coverage of labor market outcomes for all potential experience levels over a long time period. Its main disadvantages for our purposes are that it does not identify year of graduation or census division of graduation, and it does not contain information on college major. However, we can analyze the impact of entry conditions for the 14 We use annual measures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to reduce noise in the measure itself and because we cannot determine month of graduation in most data sets. 15 Our results are robust to using national unemployment rates, as well as state-level rates. While the national economy is likely the most relevant for college graduates, a more disaggregated measure provides useful variation to supplement the time series. However, local unemployment rates introduce noise generated by our inability to pinpoint the location of college graduation in some surveys. We instead must sometimes impute state of college graduation with current location of residence (see the online data appendix for details). Balancing these tensions, we compromise with the 9 census divisions as the geographic level of analysis. This takes advantage of spatial variation in entry conditions but does not generate as much additional noise as imputing state of college graduation even if workers move across state lines after college, they are less likely to move across divisions. average major, imputing timing of graduation by using the year of birth and assuming census division at graduation is the same as current census division.

In most data sets, we can easily classify college major into a set of 16 In the NSCG93, we cannot infer enrollment status. In the NLS72, we do not have enrollment status after 1976. 17 We restrict the sample to those earning at least $500 (in 2006 dollars) and top code at $400,000. We exclude earnings in the year of college graduation since this could partially reect income while in school. Earnings in the NSCG93 (non-census measure), NSCG03, and BB93 reect annual salary in the current job, since realized annual earnings is not available. 18 Wages are further restricted to be greater than $0 and are bottom-and top-coded to be between $5 and $250 per hour. 19 In principle, we could estimate a separate U c eect for each of the 51 major categories, but that quickly becomes intractable. Instead we categorize majors by the typical earnings return to the major and ask whether high-and low-return majors are dierentially impacted by entry conditions. We regress log earnings on major xed eects and controls in the pooled data (excluding the SIPP) on a sample of older workers (age 36 to 59) with at least a college degree who report being employed full time. 20 The age restriction excludes the regression sample used to estimate the eect of entry conditions on labor market outcomes, reducing any simultaneity concerns. 21 We then standardize the major xed eects to be mean zero and standard deviation one. 22 We denote these standardized xed eects as \u03b2 major . Table 2 reports the values of \u03b2 major for each of the 51 Department of Education major categories, from highest to lowest. 23 Chemical and electrical engineering, nance, and economics have the highest earnings returns, while philosophy and religion, several arts elds, and library science and non-secondary education have the lowest. 24 3 Econometric Model and Methods"}, {"section_title": "Regression Specication", "text": "To estimate the eect of the unemployment rate at graduation on labor market outcomes, and how this varies across college majors, we use the following specication. The exception is the SIPP, which has one classication of 20 categories in panels 1984-1993 and another with 18 categories from 1994-2008. We explain how we use and combine these categories below. 20 The controls in this regression are identical to those used in our main specication, described below, (excluding U c , \u03b2 major and their various interactions) except here we include a third order term in potential experience since this sample is much older. We also control for whether the worker has obtained an advanced degree to help distinguish the return to the major from returns to postgraduate education. We weight this regression with survey weights that are normed so that the weight of each survey is proportional to its size. In equation 1, Y ict is a labor market outcome measured in year t, for an individual i, in college graduation cohort c (division-graduation year), and X it is a set of control variables. 25 We also control for major xed eects (\u03b3 major ), and allow the earnings return to the major, \u03b2 major , to vary with P E it (potential experience). 26 We dene P E it as the number of years since college graduation rather than actual labor market experience, which could be endogenously related to U c and is not observed in most of our data sets. 27 U c measures labor market entry conditions, dened as the deviation of the division unemployment rate from the sample mean of 6.3% in the year of college graduation. The coecient \u03b2 2 on U c measures the impact of entry conditions on initial labor market outcomes (the year following graduation). 28 Since \u03b2 major , the earnings return to the major, is standardized to be mean 0, the main eect of U c is the impact for the average major. 29 To measure the persistence of this impact, we interact U c with a quadratic in P E it . Results are robust to only including a linear interaction, and to controlling for potential experience with 3-year buckets and allowing these to interact with U c . The coecient \u03b2 7 measures the dierential impact of entry conditions across college major on initial labor market outcomes. We include the three way interaction \u03b2 major  As we describe below, some of these will enter into the rst step regression while others enter into the second step. 26 We treat the early and late SIPP major categories as separate majors from the 51 Department of Education categories. This gives us a total of 89 majors. 27 In practice, we subtract 1 from P E it so that the interaction terms are 0 in the year after graduation, yielding a more natural interpretation for the main eects (the rst year after graduation). 28 One might worry that students endogenously respond to labor market conditions when choosing when to graduate from college. Kahn (2010) addressed this issue by instrumenting for graduating conditions with the unemployment rate at age 22. As a robustness check, we estimate the reduced form based on this instrument (since our two-step estimation procedure makes instrumenting dicult). Specically, we replace U c with a weighted average of unemployment rates experienced at age 22 and 23, with two-thirds weight on the former and one-third on the latter. We use the weighted average because graduation ages have increased compared to Kahn's sample period. We obtain very similar results, suggesting endogenous timing of college graduation is not a concern. One might also be concerned that students choose their college major in response to the business cycle. Blom (2012) does nd that students shift to higher-return majors when economic conditions are worse at age 20, resulting in an increased supply and possible negative selection of high-return majors graduating into a recession, relative to a boom. This selection would work against our ndings below that high-return majors fare relatively better than low-return majors when graduating into a recession. 29 We standardized based on the regression sample used to estimate \u03b2 major . Thus the average major is dened on the sample of workers age 36-59, employed full-time, with more weight placed on the larger data sets. 30 Results are robust to a number of additional control variables. Specically, the inclusion of surveygraduation year xed eects and survey-potential experience interactions, and \u03b2 major interacted with a cubic time trend do not change the point estimates and actually improve precision. The survey interactions are useful since outcome measures vary slightly across surveys (see online appendix table 1). The time trend in \u03b2 major controls for dierences in the return to skills over time. Results are also robust to educational attainment controls, though we prefer to omit these since they could be endogenously related to labor market Note that the interpretation of the parameters is aected by the fact that entry division unemployment rates are positively correlated with the unemployment rates at 1 and 2 years experience, so a worker leaving school in a recession is likely to experience more than just one bad year of labor market conditions. 31 Since we do not control for unemployment rates between the time of graduation and t, the terms involving U c absorb the eects of variation in labor market conditions between c and t. Our results can then be interpreted as the overall eect of graduating into a time of high unemployment, say, including a part that arises because the worker is likely to experience a couple of years of bad conditions. We could instead isolate the partial eect of U c by controlling for the values of unemployment during the years between c and t. Results are qualitatively robust to this specication, which we discuss in more detail below."}, {"section_title": "3.2 Two-Step Estimation Procedure", "text": "In practice, we cannot obtain the average eect of U c over the entire sample period by estimating the regression model in equation 1on the pooled data. These data are not balanced across time or across experience levels and are instead heavily skewed towards recent cohorts because of the ACS. We would prefer to weight the data more equally across years; this is especially important if the eect of U c varies over time. One way to estimate average eects over the time period we study is to weight each cohort-potential experience cell equally. However, this method is accompanied by a large loss in eciency, since it upweights noisy small cells and downweights precisely estimated large cells. There is no way around some degree of ineciency if we want equal weighting. However, we attempt to retain some of the precision given in the larger cells through a two-step estimation procedure. We rst estimate a regression of a labor market outcome on the control variables, weighting observations with survey weights (to take full advantage of the extra precision from larger data sets). We then collapse residuals to the major-cohort-potential experience cell (we denote this mcp-level, where m is major, c is division-graduation year, and p is potential experience) and use these in a second step regression to estimate the coecients of interest."}, {"section_title": "33", "text": "In this second step regression, we weight the data so that the distribution of observations entry conditions.

Thus, our estimates of the mcp xed eects control for dierential sorting across majors by gender and race/ethnicity. The remaining controls are included in the second step along with the key explanatory variables. We also include survey dummies in the second step because some of them are dropped in the rst stage due to collinearity within mcp-cell. Because values in the second step are collapsed to the mcp-level, the survey controls are the shares of each data set within each cell. across college majors, m, in a given cp-cell, matches the empirical distribution, but each cp-cell gets the same weight. 34 Since the unit of observation in the second step is at the mcp-level, we are naturally worried that some cells made up of very few observations will have too large an inuence. We address this concern in two ways. First, we drop all observations from graduation yearpotential experience cells with fewer than 100 observations to eliminate the inuence of the smallest cells. 35 Second, we trim the mcp-cell xed eects from the rst stage regression to eliminate extreme outliers. 36 We then estimate the second-step regression described above. In practice, we vary the control variables in the second-step regression depending on the parameters of interest, balancing concern for bias against concern for sampling error. The choice of controls drives the choice of how to cluster when estimating standard errors. When estimating the coecients \u03b2 2 , \u03b2 3 , and \u03b2 4 on U c , U c P E and U c P E 2 , we exclude graduation year xed eects. This exclusion allows both national and division-specic time series variation to contribute to identication of these parameters. Using the national variation reduces sampling error and reduces possible downward bias if division-specic variation in labor market conditions matters less for college graduates than national variation. On the other hand, unobserved trends in graduation year cohort characteristics could potentially aect the estimates. 37 The standard errors for \u03b2 2 , \u03b2 3 , and \u03b2 4 are clustered by cohort (division-graduation year), the level of variation underlying U c . For the parameters \u03b2 7 and \u03b2 8 governing the dierential eects of U c across \u03b2 major , time series variation is less important because of the variation in \u03b2 major , so we include graduation year xed eects. Given these and the major xed eects, we prefer to use robust standard errors that simply account for heteroskedasticity. Standard error estimates are typically larger when we instead cluster at the major-cohort level, but conclusions about statistical signicance remain the same in most cases. For example, in the earnings regression, the standard error for the coecient on U c \u03b2 major is about 25% larger when clustering at the major-cohort level."}, {"section_title": "38", "text": "34 Specically, we weight the second-step regression by the number of observations for a given dependent variable in the mcp-cell divided by the number of observations in the cp-cell. 35 For earnings, wages, and occupational attainment, we restrict the analysis to cells with at least 100 earnings observations, to keep these samples as similar as possible. This removes about 19,000 person-year observations, or 2.7% of our pooled, unweighted data. For employed and full-time status we drop cells with less than 100 observations for employed, removing about 4,000 observations, or 0.5% of our data. 36 We compute the residuals from a median regression of the mcp-cell xed eects on survey controls, a cubic time trend, a quadratic in P E, \u03b2 major , and \u03b2 major * P E, using second-stage regression weights. We 37 In practice, we obtain similar results when we use only the divisional variation by including graduation year xed eects. 38 We ignore serial correlation across clusters that might arise from sampling error in the estimated regressors that we use, including \u03b2 major , because we think it is a second order issue in our case.

The eect is entirely gone by year 7."}, {"section_title": "42", "text": "In 41 We t an unweighted average across the rst 10 years to avoid impacts of sample composition.\nAs mentioned above, the estimated eect of U c absorbs any impact of correlated unemployment rates in surrounding years. We have experimented with controlling exibly for intervening unemployment rates and nd fairly similar results. For example, following a similar specication to Oreopoulos et al. (2012), we allow each unemployment rate since college graduation to impact earnings with a quadratic decay in potential experience, but restrict adjacent unemployment rate years to have the same impact and decay pattern. With these controls, the impact of U c on earnings declines in magnitude by a quarter in the rst year out, by a fth in the second year out, and is otherwise very similar. Furthermore the impact of U c on earnings is far larger and more persistent than the impact of unemployment rates at 1 and 2 years of potential experience. 43 The CPS regressions, of course, do not include college major variables. Each potential experiencegraduation cohort cell is given equal weight to simulate the two-step estimation procedure we use in the main sample. We impute division at time of college graduation with current division of residence and dene -0.07 (0.016) loss in the rst year after graduation (panel A , column 1) but still signicant at the 1% level. Furthermore, the experience prole has a more shallow decay. This results in an average eect over the rst 10 years of experience of 0.022 (0.01) log earnings loss per year, about double the magnitude in the combined sample, and signicant at the 5% level. The estimates for the two data sets bracket the results of Oreopoulos et al. 2012, who nd that a 1 ppt increase in the national or provincial unemployment rate at college graduation reduces earnings by roughly 2% in the rst year (or by 8% for a large recession) before fading away over the next 5 years. They lie well below Kahn's (2010) estimates. She nds an initial decline in pay rates of more than 20% for white males who graduated in the worst part of the 1981-82 recession compared to those who graduated in the nearby booms, in the U.S. Her estimates diminish over time but remain signicant well past 10 years out of college. The remainder of tables 3 and 4 gives guidance as to whether these earnings eects are driven by dierences in time spent working, wage rates, occupational attainment, or some combination. Column 2 shows only modest impacts of entry conditions on the probability of being employed. In the combined sample (table 3, column2), the average impact over the rst 10 years of a career is a 0.007 (0.004) decline in the probability of being employed, statistically signicant at the 10% level. This is small compared to the mean probability of being employed in this sample, 0.89. The experience prole is also surprising in that we nd no eect early in a career. Sampling error is probably part of the story. In the CPS, where we have consistent, large samples throughout the time period, the eect on employment is a substantial -0.018 (0.005) in the rst year out, signicant at the 1% level. This eect halves by three years out, is only signicant at the 5% level, and becomes small and insignicant thereafter. We nd sizeable eects on the probability of full-time employment in both the combined sample and the CPS. In the combined sample (table 3, column 3), a worker graduating into a large recession is 0.066 (0.012) less likely to be employed full time in the rst year out of school, statistically signicant at the 1% level. Compared to the mean probability of fulltime employment for this sample, 0.77, this eect is quite substantial. It is also large enough to account for much of the rst-year earnings loss. 44 The eect then falls roughly in half by eects. When we restrict the sample to those working full-time (not shown) we nd earnings eects that are about half the magnitude of those presented here. We can also measure hours worked in the CPS (though we cannot in many of the constituent data sets in the combined sample). There we nd that even conditional on working during the year, the log of annual hours worked is 0.0358 (0.01) lower in the rst year out after graduating into a large recession, signicant at the 1% level ( Naturally, the T op5 measure can only be estimated in our combined sample. Results are reported in columns 5 and 6 of table 3 and column 5 of table 4. In both data sets, we nd modest impacts of graduating into a large recession on occupation quality. In the combined data, we estimate a large 0.026 (0.0089) reduction in earnings return to the occupation in the rst year out, signicant at the 1% level. This coecient is easily interpreted since the occupation earnings return is in log earnings units. Thus the eect is about one-quarter of the earnings eect and more than half the size of the wage eect, where one would expect impacts on occupation quality to be concentrated. By the third year out the coecient is less than half the magnitude and is no longer signicant. However, time spent in lower-paying occupations in the rst few years out of school might impact wages years later holding occupation constant, since it might put workers on dierent trajectories for training and advancement. Furthermore, the CPS shows the occupation eects themselves might persist. In table 4, column 5, we estimate a smaller eect in the rst year out, -0.015 (0.009), signicant at the 10% level. The experience prole shows initial convergence, but then divergence back to the same magnitude and signicance 10 years out. We do not nd any signicant impacts on our measure of match quality (table 3, column 6), the probability of being in a common occupation given one's major. The eect in the rst year is -0.011 (0.014) and averages to -0.013 (0.008) over 10 years. These eects are modest relative to the sample mean of 0.37. They are also unlikely to have a large impact on earnings, given the earnings return to T op5 of 26%. However, given sampling error, we cannot rule out modest-sized eects. To sum up, for the full sample period we nd that graduating into a time of high unemployment results in substantial earnings losses early in a career. The losses are driven partially by an inability to obtain work hours and partially from a loss in earning power. Results are qualitatively similar across the combined data and the CPS, though magnitudes do dier somewhat. The data sets are remarkably similar on full-time employment and wages. The probability of full-time employment is reduced initially by roughly 0.05 (taking an average of the two estimates), and by 0.013 on average per year over the rst 10 years. Wages are about 4% lower in the rst year and about 1.5% lower per year over the rst 10 years. For employment and occupation quality, average impacts over 10 years are pretty similar across data sets, though not the time path. While employment eects are small, it is likely that a diculty obtaining jobs in high-paying occupations can account for some of the wage and earnings losses. Point estimates on earnings eects are not quite as consistent across data sets, ranging from -0.07 to -0.12 in the rst year out and -0.0135 to -0.022 averaged over 10 years. Given that both data sets have advantages and disadvantages, we choose as our preferred estimate an average of the two, roughly 10% earnings loss in the rst year and and nd a signicant premium for workers who work in a eld related to their degree. They estimate a 30% return for science majors to working in a job related to their major, similar to what we estimate here for the full set of majors. 1.8% loss per year on average over the rst 10 years."}, {"section_title": "4.2 Changes in the Link between Entry Conditions and Outcomes", "text": "The national unemployment rate was 9.3% in 2009 and 9.6% in 2010, 3.5 and 3.8 ppts (respectively) above the national mean over this time period.

Panel B of tables 3 and 4 reports early career outcomes for those graduating into a large recession, allowing the eects to dier for those graduating in 2004 or later. We chose this cuto date so that the post period includes graduates from the Great Recession, as well as the preceding boom and subsequent recovery. 51 Naturally, for this group, we can only identify impacts early in a career. Both data sets show substantially larger, negative impacts in the rst year out in the post period. For example, column 1 of table 3 shows that in the pre-2004 period, workers graduating into a large recession earned 0.076 (0.0289) log points less in their rst year out. In contrast, the tted impact for the same sized recession (4 ppt unemployment rate increase) is more than three times as large for those graduating on or after 2004. Three years out, the tted impact is still double the magnitude in the post-period, compared to the pre-period. Eects are fairly similar in the CPS (table 4, panel B). Impacts on earnings in the postperiod are double that of the pre-period at both 1 and 3 years out. In both data sets, we also see much larger, negative employment eects in the post-period that are signicant at both 1 and 3 years out. Impacts on full-time employment are large, negative, and signicant in both pre-and post-periods, though the data sets dier on which period was worse. Wage 49 In section 2 we discussed the advantages and disadvantages of the CPS versus the combined sample. One important drawback in the CPS is an inability to date graduation. To the extent that eects on employment, full-time status, and hours are relatively temporary, this would inuence eects on earnings in the early years more than wage rates. 50 We have also investigated the possibility that the eect of a change is U c is bigger when U c is high, in which case the consequences of graduating during the Great Recession might be more severe than our results imply. We estimated a version of our model that allowed the coecient \u03b2 2 to depend on whether U c is above or below its sample mean. In the CPS, the point estimates of the slope coecients are very close for all labor market outcomes, and they are not signicantly dierent. In the combined data set, the estimates are less precise but, if anything, the estimated eect of U c is smaller in a recession than in a boom (not reported). For example, in the case of earnings, the coecient U c is -0.028 (.0065) when U c is above its mean and -0.035 (.0080) when it is below its mean. 51 Specically, we interact all of our key explanatory variables in (1) (P E, P E 2 , U c , U c P E, U c P E 2 , \u03b2 major , \u03b2 major P E, U c \u03b2 major , U c \u03b2 major P E) with an indicator equaling 1 if the worker graduated in 2004 or later (plus a main eect of graduating on or after 2004). Results in this section are similar when we use 2001 or 1998 as the cuto date. The regression coecients underlying the results in panel B of tables 3 and 4 can be found in appendix table 3 and online appendix tables 3-7, under columns labeled (4) and 7, respectively. rates exhibit a similar pattern to earnings, though in the combined data convergence is much more rapid. Eects on occupational attainment do not present a consistent pattern. On balance, tables 3 and 4 show that the recent period was a much more dicult time to graduate into a recession. Most eects remain worse three years after graduation, though it remains to be seen whether these larger eects will persist beyond that. 5 Dierential Eects Across College Major 5.1 Earnings Table 5 summarizes regression results on the interaction eects between \u03b2 major , the earnings return to the major, and the graduating unemployment rate (U c ). In panel B, we report the dierential impact of graduating into a large recession for a high-return major (\u03b2 major = 1), compared to the average major (\u03b2 major = 0), at various experience levels. 52 In panel A, we report the main eect of \u03b2 major as well the coecient on its interaction with potential experience from a regression that omits major xed eects (column 2 in appendix table 3 and online appendix tables 3-7). The main eect of \u03b2 major for a given dependent variable provides a natural benchmark in assessing the dierential impact of a large recession across college majors. We also compare the dierential impact to the estimates of the eect of U c (the impact on the average graduate) based on the combined data sets, although we are mindful of the fact that the CPS estimates of the average eect are somewhat dierent. Aside from the need for data on college major, estimation of the dierential eects is easier than estimation of the average eect, because it is identied primarily by variation within graduation year/division cohorts. In the rst year after graduation, the loss from graduating into a large recession is 0.055 (0.011) log points less for a high-return major. That is, a high-return major gains back nearly half the initial losses experienced by the average major (-0.12 from table 3). Earnings inequality across majors thus widens by almost an additional third for those graduating into a large recession (comparing the 0.055 to the main eect of a standard deviation increase in \u03b2 major on log earnings, 0.18). Over time, the dierential impacts gradually diminish. On average over the rst 10 years of a career, high-return majors lose 0.020 (0.006) log points less in earnings, relative to the average major graduating into a large recession. This is more than a complete oset to the main eect reported in deviation larger \u03b2 major (e.g., chemistry) will not experience a statistically signicant earnings loss, even in the rst year out of school. 54 The blue lines show earnings for \u03b2 major = 1.5 (electrical engineering, for example). The purple lines show earnings for \u03b2 major = 0 (e.g., journalism). The green lines show earnings for \u03b2 major = \u22121.5 (e.g., art history and ne arts). The solid lines show earnings for those graduating in the average economy for our sample (U c = 6.5); the dashed lines t a 4 ppt lower U c (boom). Finally, the dotted lines show a 4 ppt higher U c (bust). The average tted annual earnings in our sample is $92,000. Several interesting features stand out in this graph. First, the dierences in earnings across majors are large and widen with experience. Second, entry conditions also matter. At 1 year of potential experience, one can easily see the gap in earnings across boom and bust cohorts (dashed and dotted lines, respectively) within major. The gap is largest for the low-return major (green line). Correspondingly, the time it takes to overcome this gap is longest for the low-return major. Also, it is better to graduate in a boom as a low-return major than to graduate in a bust as an average major, at least initially (the dashed green line is higher than the dotted purple line at 1 year of experience). However, it is always better to be a high-return major, regardless of entry conditions, than the average major (all the blue lines are above all the purple lines). The reason for this is that busts tend to widen inequality, pushing workers away from the mean, while booms tend to narrow inequality. Thus a high-return major graduating in a bust widens his or her advantage over the average major, while a low-return major graduating in a boom narrows his or her disadvantage."}, {"section_title": "Other Labor Market Outcomes", "text": "Column 2 of table 5 presents results on the probability of being employed. Panel A shows that workers with high-return majors have a small, but statistically signicant, employment advantage that widens with experience; a major with a 1 standard deviation higher \u03b2 major is 0.004 more likely to be employed and this advantage widens by 0.0012 each year. Panel B shows that this initial employment advantage widens substantially when graduating into a large recession. For example, the 0.0067 (0.004) impact on the employment probability in the 53 We again point out that these eects subsume any impacts of economic conditions in the years surrounding college graduation, to the extent that unemployment rates are serially correlated. When we control for the stream of unemployment rates an individual faces between college graduation and the period when labor market conditions are measured, as described above, we obtain very similar results. Impacts on earnings are reduced by about 0.01 log point. 54 For each U c , \u03b2 major , P E combination, we t log earnings for a white woman in the omitted survey, using the constants from the rst stage regression and a second-stage regression with no major or graduation year xed eects, and coecients from our preferred specications for U c and U c \u03b2 major . The U c eect, its interactions with P E, and the main quadratic in P E come from the specication in column 1 of appendix table 3. The \u03b2 major main eect and P E interaction are from column 2, and the \u03b2 major interaction with U c is from column 3. To convert to expected earnings, we take the anti-log of this plus 0.5 times the residual variance from the rst stage, making the assumption that the errors are log normal. rst year out implies a more than doubling of the initial gap. This eect is only marginally signicant and fades quickly after the rst year. On the other hand, the probability of being employed full-time (column 3) shows much larger and more persistent dierential eects. From panel A, high-return majors are on average 0.051 more likely to be employed full-time, a large advantage relative to the base probability of 0.77. This advantage gradually declines in magnitude as workers gain experience. From panel B, high-return majors graduating into a large recession experience an additional 0.015 increase in their probability of being employed full-time over the rst 10 years of their career. The advantage is largest in the rst year out when high-return majors increase their initial advantage by 0.03 (or 59%), and it osets roughly half the impact on the average major (table 3, column 3). These eects remain signicant through the 7th year. Thus, the dierential impact of graduating into a large recession on job-nding capability can partially explain why the earnings eects are muted for high-return majors. At the same time, even full-time workers experience large earnings dierentials across college major. Though not shown here, we nd that the earnings eects are still about half as large when we restrict the sample to full-time workers. Thus the dierential earnings eects must be driven in part by a dierential impact on earning power, in addition to dierential impacts on the ability to obtain work hours. Indeed, column 4 shows that high-return majors graduating into a large recession also widen their advantage in hourly rates of pay. Panel A shows that a one standard deviation higher \u03b2 major is associated with a 0.15 log point higher wage rate in their rst year out, with this advantage widening by 0.003 each year. Panel B shows that this initial advantage widens by 15% when graduating into a large recession, with impacts persisting for roughly as long as the earnings eect. Again, the dierential impact for high-return majors osets roughly half of the initial eect on wages for the average major graduating into a recession (table 3, column 4). Columns 5 and 6 present results on occupational attainment. From column 5, panel A, high-return majors work in occupations that pay 0.13 log points more than the occupations of the average major. Panel B shows that this initial occupational advantage widens by 0.011 log points (8%) for those who graduate into a large recession. This dierential advantage dissipates with experience but is still signicant even 7 years out of school. Thus, a substantial part of the earnings and wage eects could be driven by lower \u03b2 major workers being relegated to lower quality jobs."}, {"section_title": "55", "text": "55 Our estimates imply that much of the earnings dierential across college majors can be accounted for by dierences in occupation quality. From panel A, a one standard deviation increase in \u03b2 major is associated with a 0.18 increase in log earnings (column 1, panel A), as well as an increase in occupational quality of 0.13 log earnings points (column 5, panel A). Taken at face value these estimates suggest that 71% of the earnings return to college major is associated with access to higher-paying occupations, although this is an overstatement because we did not control for college major when estimating the occupation xed eects. Furthermore, while high-return majors are not more likely to be found in an occupation common to other workers in their major (column 6, panel A), they are dierentially more likely to be found in a top-5 occupation when graduating into a large recession (panel B). Impacts actually become larger as workers gain experience, and are positive and signicant over the rst ten years on average. It could be that early diculty nding good work impacts one's ability to stay on track later in a career. Low \u03b2 major graduates are less successful in obtaining the types of jobs they had in mind when they chose their major, and likely experience earnings losses as a result. On balance, table 5 shows that high-return majors increase their already strong advantage when graduating into a recession; they experience signicantly milder eects along every dimension we can measure. Early on, ability or versatility serves high-return majors well in that they can nd higher paying jobs with more work hours. Early struggles for low-return majors appear to stay with them since they are more likely to be mis-matched even years later."}, {"section_title": "The Great Recession", "text": "Panel C presents estimates in which we allow the eects to dier for those graduating before 2004 and those graduating in or around the Great Recession (2004 or later)."}, {"section_title": "In tables", "text": "3 and 4, we found that the average major took a substantially larger earnings hit when graduating in this later period.

Employment dierentials essentially disappear, as does the dierential impact on obtaining a job in a high-paying occupation, while high-return majors actually face relative disadvantages in nding full-time work. We investigate these ndings further in the next section."}, {"section_title": "Additional Results and Discussion", "text": "We have estimated all of our results separately by gender and obtain very similar patterns. Also, our results are robust to a number of alternative measures of the skill level of the major, meaning our results are not particularly sensitive to the way we dene \u03b2 major . 57 Another way of characterizing college majors that is not necessarily reective of skill, but could be particularly relevant over the business cycle, is by the degree of occupational 56 Regression coecients underlying these estimates can be found in appendix table 3 and online appendix tables 3-7, under columns labeled (5). 57 For example, we nd similar results when using the average SAT math score in the major, as well as an SAT-ACT composite, with both measures obtained from the Baccalaureate and Beyond panels. Also, results are robust to using a proxy measure of the skill level required in the occupations a major typically enters into, which uses O*NET task data on critical thinking and problem solving. Details of these analyses are available upon request. concentration. Some majors typically enter into a narrower set of occupations than others. These majors might be more prone to sectoral shocks, since they have a less diverse set of options. We have explored whether the eects of graduating into a recession depend upon the occupational concentration of the major, dened as the share of graduates within a major who are in the top 5 occupations for that major. Nursing, computer programming, and civil engineering have the highest occupation concentration levels, while environmental studies, lm and other arts, and other social sciences have the lowest. We nd modest negative eects on earnings and wages in the rst few years out for majors with higher occupation concentration graduating into a downturn, as well as large, negative, persistent impacts on the probability of being in an occupation common to one's major. This is consistent with the notion that versatility of a major is an important factor in weathering a recession. However, we nd almost no correlation between average earnings return to a major and the occupation concentration of the major. Consequently, these eects cannot help explain our nding that earnings of high-return majors are less sensitive to recessions. Results for the occupational concentration measure are available upon request. We have also investigated the impact of entry conditions on graduate educational attainment, a subject that has received little attention in the past. 58 Dierences in educational attainment could aect earnings outcomes by altering the composition of recent college graduates in the labor force across the business cycle. And, if many students graduating into a recession are induced to obtain further schooling, they could eventually out-earn their counterparts who graduated in better times.

While these eects are intuitive, they are too small to substantially impact sample selection across years of potential experience. Including enrolled workers and controlling for educational attainments has little eect on the results reported above. 58 Kahn (2010) shows that students graduating in the worst part of the 1981 recession obtain an additional year of graduate school, on average, relative to those graduating in the best times.

First, for almost all of the sample period, the unemployment rate is highest for the low-earning majors (green line) and lowest for the high-earning majors (blue line). This illustrates a potential confounding factor: unemployment rates reect both labor demand conditions and the ability to nd employment given demand conditions. Below, we "}, {"section_title": "62", "text": "Second, all lines exhibit the same cyclical pattern, but, for much of the period, the amplitudes are quite dierent. The national unemployment rate (yellow dashed line) tends to have larger increases in recessions and decreases in booms than any of the major-specic unemployment rates, reecting the fact that the labor market for college graduates is overall less cyclical. Also, for much of the period, there is an analogous pattern across major-specic unemployment rates, with the lower \u03b2 major groups experiencing higher amplications. This suggests that lower \u03b2 major majors tend to be found in jobs that are more cyclically sensitive. Third, these cyclical patterns changed dramatically in the last decade. The size of the run up and run down of the unemployment rate surrounding both the 2001 recession and the Great Recession look very similar across groups of majors and more similar to the national unemployment rate. This suggests that labor demand for jobs that high-return majors tend to go into, and the market for college graduates as a whole, has become more cyclically sensitive. We now quantify the relationship between the major-specic unemployment rates and aggregate economic conditions by regressing U major c on the divisional value of U c , \u03b2 major and \u03b2 major * U c , plus a cubic time trend.

The results described below are similar when using this measure. However, the link between the change in employment and the level of employment demand may be more tenuous, which is why we prefer the unemployment rate. We do not use major-specic employment levels because the link between this measure and the aggregate unemployment rate is highly sensitive to how we detrend it. period 1971-2012, where an observation is a major-division-year. The coecient on U c is 0.25 (0.0173), which says that the unemployment rate for college graduates uctuates only about one fourth as much as that of the whole labor market. The coecient on \u03b2 major is negative and signicant, meaning that higher-skilled majors are less likely to be unemployed. The interaction term of -0.026 (0.004) on \u03b2 major * U c indicates that when aggregate unemployment rises, labor demand conditions deteriorate less for higher-earning majors, and also possibly that higher-earning majors adapt better to demand conditions."}, {"section_title": "63", "text": "The fact that demand for high-skilled majors is less sensitive to the business cycle could help account for the widening earnings advantage of high-skilled majors in recessions compared to booms.

That is, the labor market for college graduates became much more correlated with aggregate market conditions. This is reected in the gure, which shows that the run up in majorspecic unemployment in the Great Recession was very similar to that for the national rate. This could easily explain why the negative eects of entry conditions were much larger in magnitude for graduates from 2004 onwards.

For 1971-2003, demand for higher-skilled majors was 17.2% less cyclically sensitive than for the average major. It declined to 2.5% for the recent period. This may in part explain the reduced advantage for high-skilled majors graduating into the Great Recession, compared to the earlier period.

Most of the analysis pools information on the graduating classes of 1974-2011. However, we also examine whether labor market conditions matter more for recent college classes, which include those from the Great Recession. We use both the CPS and a combined data set that pools information from seven distinct surveys to provide the most comprehensive analysis of the eects of entry conditions on college graduates to date. Given that the nature of economic uctuations varies, the long time period we work with brings substantial added value to this question, as does our analysis across elds of study, which has received little attention in the literature. We nd that early careers are disrupted by poor labor market conditions. For college graduates on average, we estimate that earnings decline by roughly 10% in the rst year out after graduating into a large recession, and by about 1.8% per year on average over the rst 10 years. These eects mostly fade out over the rst seven years of a career. They are driven by short-term negative eects on the employment rate and especially the fulltime employment rate, as well as somewhat more persistent eects on wage rates. A shift to lower-paying occupations accounts for a substantial fraction of the initial wage loss, although the CPS and the combined data dier on the persistence of this occupational downgrading eect. We also nd that the early careers of higher-skilled majors (as measured by the earnings premium) are less sensitive to aggregate conditions at graduation. In other words, the earnings gap across college majors widens in recessions. A person in a typically high-earning major increases his or her earnings advantage by almost a third when graduating into a severe recession, relative to an average major, and this eect remains large for the rst seven years after college graduation. These dierential eects reect increases in the probability of employment and full-time employment for higher-skilled majors relative to lower-skilled majors graduating into a recession, as well as dierential eects on wage rates and occupational attainment. We investigate the extent to which dierences in labor demand cyclicality across college major can account for the dierential eects of entry conditions. While we do nd that the unemployment rates of higher paying majors are less sensitive to the business cycle, the dierences in sensitivity are too small to account for the dierential impacts on earnings. It could instead be that since lower-skilled majors spend more of their early experience years out of full-time employment, they suer more from hysteresis, due for example to skill depreciation. We had expected lower-skilled majors to be less sensitive to this depreciation, but evidence suggests that there are in general large penalties for time spent out of work Eects on occupation quality and match quality may be able to account for some of the dierential earnings and wage eects across majors. High-skilled majors graduating into a recession are relatively more likely to be in occupations that are both higher paying and more typical for their major, compared to lower-skilled majors. The occupation quality dierentials fade out over the rst 10 years of a career, but the match quality eects persist. This suggests that an initial ability to obtain quality work hours serves high-skilled majors well, prevents any negative impacts of early time spent out of full-time employment, and leaves them better set up to be in jobs that are a good t even years later. Though earnings and wage dierentials due to entry conditions do not persist across college majors, persistent dierences in the ability to attain a job one likely had in mind when choosing his or her major could result in persistent dierences in job satisfaction and well-being. We nd eects on earnings are substantially more negative for graduates from the Great Recession. The per unit eect of an increase in the aggregate unemployment rate for graduates from 2004-2011 one year after graduation is between 2 and 3 times the value for graduates from 1974-2003. A substantial part of this increase is probably explained by the fact that the unemployment rates of college graduates as whole became much more sensitive to aggregate economic conditions in the years surrounding the Great Recession. We also nd that the eects of economic conditions have become much more evenly distributed across college major. It looks as though the modern recession is more broadbased, impacting recent college graduates and higher-skilled majors to a greater extent than previous recessions. The two most recent recessions may then have leveled the playing eld to some degree across education groups and within college graduates; that is, college graduates bore something closer to their fair share, relative to non-college workers, and the same was      Notes: The sample is the combined data set described in the text.

Online appendix table 1 summarizes variable denitions by data set. We then describe the creation of characteristics of college majors and occupational attainment variables. Some variables are created in the same way in all of the data sets. In all data sets, information on race, gender, and age are straightforward to obtain. We code race/ethnicity in three categories: Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, and other non-Hispanic. 1 Potential experience is dened as year minus bachelor's degree graduation year. All earnings and wage measures are adjusted to 2006 dollars using the Consumer Price Index (CPI). We restrict to earnings greater than $500 in our main sample and top code annual earnings at $400,000. We exclude enrolled workers and those in the year of college graduation from the earnings sample. CPI-adjusted wages must be greater than 0 and are top-and bottom-coded to be between $5 and $250 per hour. Analysis of wages and the occupation measures is restricted to those with a valid earnings observation. The sample used to study employment and fulltime employment is restricted to the non-enrolled but includes observations from the year of graduation and includes people with 0 earnings. Our preferred measure of labor market conditions at graduation is the unemployment rate for the census division level of graduation. The U.S. Census Bureau denes nine divisions: New England, Middle Atlantic, East North Central, West North Central, East South Central, West South Central, South Atlantic, Mountain, and Pacic. We obtain the annual unemployment rate for each census division from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Local Area Unemployment Statistics. We restrict all of our analysis to workers who graduated college between ages 20 and 24, inclusive. This eliminates about 20% of the available observations in data sets other than the ACS, mostly from late graduates. We cannot impose this restriction on the ACS because graduation year is not available. We also restrict to workers age 22 to 35 with 13 or fewer years of potential experience. 1 Some data sets, including the ACS, have more detailed information on race/ethnicity, but others have only these three options, which is why we use them. Some data sets do not have a mixed-race option, so we cannot consistently code mixed-race respondents. We code those who indicate that they are mixed-race as other non-Hispanic when mixed race is an option. 1.1"}, {"section_title": "Data sets", "text": "The National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth  Because earnings are dened for the year prior to the survey year, we use information from the previous survey (if there is one available) to make restrictions on the earnings sample. However, we still use the current survey weight. For example, from the 1990 survey we obtain earnings in the previous calendar and the survey weight. We restrict to observations who report not being enrolled in the 1989 survey. (We also use employment and hours from the 1989 survey when those are relevant for sample restrictions, for example when dening \u03b2 major .) When there is no previous survey, we use the current survey. In earnings regressions we lag potential experience and calendar time variables. For wages and occupational attainment variables, we restrict the sample to those with non-missing earnings. 2 For example, the 1990 survey asks for earnings in 1989, and we code these as 1989 annual earnings. For the NLSY's, this means those with non-missing earnings from the next survey, which refers to earnings measured over the same time period. Year of college graduation is straightforward to create since both surveys contain questions about educational attainment each year. In the NLSY79, we use the response to the year of degree question in the rst year after graduation, and then ll in missing values by going forward. In the NLSY97, we use the BLS-created variable for date of bachelor's degree. We use the restricted-access geocodes to gain information on state (and census division) of college degree and current location. If the graduation year is a survey year, we dene state of graduation as the state of residence at the time of the survey. Respondents who graduated before 1979 are excluded from our analysis. Less than 10 respondents t this category. The NLSY surveys each have their own college major categories; the NLSY79 has hundreds of categories, while the NLSY97 has only about 50.

The sample frame is those who reported having a college degree in the previous decennial census (1990 and 2000, respectively). Given our age restrictions, workers in the NSCG93 sample graduated from college between 1976 and 1990, while the NSCG03 sample graduated between 1986 and 2000. We obtain the NSCG93 data from the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), which links respondents to the 1990 decennial census. This allows up to two earnings observations per worker for the NSCG93: 1990 and 1993. We obtain the public-use NSCG03 data from the National Science Foundation website, which does not allow us to link the data to the 2000 census, leaving labor market data measured only in 2003.

This only counts earnings in the primary job. Employment, enrollment, and full-time status refer to either the time of the survey or the reference month, depending on the survey wave. Full-time status is a direct question asking full-time or part-time status in the primary job. Highest degree completed and occupation in the primary job at the time of the survey (or in the reference month) are taken from direct questions. The BB has only about 40 occupation categories, which we map into 1990 occupation codes using names of occupations. We treat the three waves BB93 as one survey and the BB08 as another when dening our survey xed eects. Year of college graduation is straightforward since in each survey all respondents graduated in the same year. For location of graduation, we utilize a direct question about the state of the respondent's undergraduate institution. Majors are given in about 100 categories in the BB93, which we crosswalk to the Department of Education categories using our own mapping. The BB03 gives majors in CIP codes, which are very similar to the Department of Education codes, so this crosswalk is simple."}, {"section_title": "The National Longitudinal Study", "text": "The National Longitudinal Study (NLS72) is a panel survey administered by the Department of Education. The sample is about 16,000 high school seniors in 1972, with the bulk of eventual college graduates graduating in 1976. We exploit two waves of the survey with post-graduation information (1979 and 1986); most sample members provided information about 1977 and 1978 in the 1979 wave, while in 1986 a smaller subset of the sample (roughly 40%) was asked for job and pay information about the years between 1979 and 1986, giving us multiple years of observation. We obtain year of college graduation using the 1976, 1979, and 1986 follow-up waves and questions regarding intervening years. If no other information is available, we assign graduation year as the rst year in which a respondent says he or she has at least four years of college. Because these workers are in a single high school graduation cohort, the NLS72 provides little variation in economic conditions at the time of graduation. Thus the same caveats apply here as those described with the BB data sets. The NLS72 gives us the starting and ending/current wage in the most recent job. Our wage measure is the average of the two. We multiply wages by hours worked in the past year in the most recent job (a direct question) to get the annual earnings measure. Employment and occupation are at the time of the survey. Occupation is given in 1970 3-digit census codes, which we map to 1990 codes using the mapping from Ruggles et al. (2010). Highest grade completed is based on a direct question about years of school completed. We do not use enrollment information beyond 1976. Thus we must include all observations meeting the other criteria in our analyses that typically exclude the enrolled. The waves of the NLS72 are treated as one survey from the perspective of our survey xed eects. Location of college graduation is determined by using the zip code in the year of presumed graduation, which we map to the state level. College major information is derived from data on the respondents' college transcripts. This has about 50 categories, which we map to the Department of Education codes using our own mapping. The earnings measure is total wage and salary income in the past 12 months. Unfortunately, we do not know when the respondent was interviewed, and thus we do not know if the earnings refers mostly to the prior year, to the current year, or equally to both. We therefore follow the ACS's own reporting practices and assign the earnings as being measured in the survey year, rather than the prior calendar year. To construct wages, we divide annual earnings by the product of weeks worked in the prior 12 months and usual hours per week. Employment and enrollment are dened at the survey date. We dene a worker as being The ACS unfortunately does not contain time or location of college degree. We instead impute the year of graduation as the year a respondent was likely 22 (the modal age in the other data sets) in May. For workers born in the rst two quarters of the year, the year of graduation is birth year plus 22. For workers born in the second half of the year, graduation year is birth year plus 23. 11 We use current state and division of residence as the graduating state and division. The ACS has its own categories for college major, which we map to the Department of Education categories based on major names. We calendar year. Construction of thevariables used in the analysis of eects of entry conditions for college graduates as a whole (Table 4) are fairly standard, so we will not go into details. We also use the March CPS from 1971 to 2012 to generate supplemental information on employment and unemployment across occupations and industries. (Table 6 and Figure   2). For each 3-digit 1990 census occupation and one-digit industry ( We restrict the sample to employed college graduates aged 25 to 59. An occupation-industryspecic unemployment rate is dened as the number of unemployed workers who were most recently employed in that occupation-industry, divided by those unemployed workers plus employment in the occupation-industry. We then aggregate these unemployment rates to the major level using a major to occupation-industry mapping, which we describe in the next section. We use a similar approach to generate a major-specic employment growth measure (the rst dierence in log employment)."}, {"section_title": "Major Characteristics", "text": "In all data sets but the SIPP, it is straightforward to map majors into 51 categories used by the Department of Education. We regress log annual earnings on controls (gender, race, region, potential experience, and year dummies) and major xed eects, separately for the pooled data and the SIPP, with psychology as the excluded category in each regression. The major xed eects are the major earnings measure. This regression is performed on those aged 36 to 59, which excludes the main estimation sample to avoid any simultaneity concerns. We standardize the major xed eects by subtracting each sample mean (the combined or the SIPP) and dividing by the combined sample standard deviation (so the units are comparable in the SIPP). The occupational concentration of the major is also obtained for the 51 major categories and then mapped into the SIPP. For this variable, we pool the non-SIPP data and compute the fraction of people in each major that go into each 1990 census 3-digit occupation. Our preferred measure is the share of workers from each major that go into the ve most common occupations, but results are similar for the top three and top seven as well. This measure is obtained using only those age 25 to 36. For the major-specic demand measures described in the previous section (using the March CPS), we require a major to have an occupation-industry mapping. We obtain this by pooling the ACS and NSCG03 (the NSCG93 does not have information on industry). Using employed college graduates aged 25 to 59, we nd the share of employment from each major in each occupation-industry cell, using 3-digit occupation codes and 1-digit industry codes, both from the 1990 classication. We then apply this mapping to the occupationindustry measures from the March CPS to get major-level measures.

The rst is the estimated earnings return to the 3-digit 1990 census occupation averaged over the 4 survey years (2009-2012). For a sample of non-enrolled, full-time employed workers aged 25-59, earning at least $500 in the past 12 months, we regress log annual earnings on worker characteristics (the standard controls included in all the previous regressions plus a cubic in potential experience and year eects) and occupation xed eects. We use these occupation xed eects as our measure of occupation quality, merging them at the 3-digit census code level for the occupations reported in the pooled data. We could have instead estimated occupation return from our pooled data sets, but we prefer the precision and consistency of the large ACS samples. We have also estimated a wage return to occupation (estimating the regression described above but on log wages earnings divided by the product of weeks and usual hours) and obtained extremely similar results. This is not surprising given a 0.98 correlation between the two measures. For the SIPP, this measure is the average earnings return across all months in the year with a valid occupation observation. The second occupation, measure which we use as an indicator of match quality in the current job, is an indicator for whether the current occupation (reported in the pooled data) is among the top 5 occupations for a given major, using 1990 census 3-digit occupation codes.
