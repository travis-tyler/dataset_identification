Between 1992 and 1997, the U.S. Census of Agriculture shows the number of U.S. farms growing nursery and greenhouse crops increased by 43%, to a total of 67,816 establishments [U.S. Department of Agriculture/National Agricultural Statistics Service (USDA/NASS)].\nSales have also exhibited strong growth. Correcting for inflation, producer sales of floriculture and greenhouse products rose by more than 18% from 1991 to 2000, exceeding $13.2 billion [USDA/ Martin Shields is Assistant Professor of Agricultural and Regional Economics, and Fern K.

The authors thank two referees for their valuable suggestions. 1 The term \"Environmental Horticulture Industry\" refers to all businesses engaged in the production, retail, wholesale, re-wholesale, and/or installation or maintenance of green goods (plants, trees, sod, cut flowers, etc.) and related hard goods (tools, mulch, pavers, fertilizers, plant containers, etc.)."}, {"section_title": "Economic Research Service (ERS)]. While data", "text": "are not yet available for analysis from the 2002 agricultural census, it appears likely the industry has continued to expand. Moreover, this growth has not been limited to the production of plants and trees. An analysis of County Business Patterns (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2000) data shows that an increased demand for EHI products and services had led to growth in a number of related sectors, such as landscaping goods, wholesale and retail trade operations, and the landscape service industry. Thus, EHI growth has not only created jobs in agriculture, but has also helped affiliated businesses prosper.\nThe increasing importance of the EHI in the Northeast relative to other agricultural sectors suggests this sector may offer new opportunities to strengthen the region's agricultural economy. First, because many growers ship their products out of the region, the industry provides a stimulus for increasing regional agricultural exports, injecting new monies into the regional economy. Second, the industry's production practices foster opportunities to maintain a strong agricultural base in an everchanging economy. Specifically, nursery and green-house production generally requires less land than most agricultural activities-likely a desirable attribute in an increasingly urbanized region. Indeed, Heimlich and Barnard (1992) identified \"adaptive farms\" (defined by high values per acre, and including EHI producers) as an important component of the future of agriculture in the Northeast, noting adaptive farms are \"likely to survive and increase because they can better compete economically with urban land uses\" (p. 59).\nGiven the increasing importance of the sector, an improved understanding of the nature and extent of the EHI and its wider economic contribution is needed.\n2 For individual businesses, basic industry information provides a needed perspective in planning for growth and marketing. As an expanding presence in the agricultural economy, the industry can use this information to further its objectives with regard to market growth, competitiveness, and government assistance. Lacking clear information, political leaders, government agencies, educators, researchers, and the public may overlook or downplay the industry's importance and its contributions to the region's economic and social well-being.\nWhile it is generally recognized that the U.S. EHI has expanded to meet the increasing demand for its products, careful economic analysis of the industry's scope and contribution has been limited. At the national level, Turner and Kriesel (1995) used the IMPLAN input-output (IO) model to examine the role of the EHI in the U.S. economy. Using IMPLAN-provided data from 1990, they constructed employment and output multipliers, concluding that the industry was the second leading employer in production agriculture and the sixthranked production agriculture sector in terms of output in the United States.\nSeveral researchers have also examined the industry within individual states in the South and West, including Arizona (Cox, Leones, and Hollyer, 1995) , Louisiana (Hughes and Hinson, 2000) , and Florida (Hodges and Haydu, 2000) . These statelevel analyses also employed the IMPLAN model, supplemented by survey data, to examine issues such as linkages between producers and service industries (Arizona) and broadly defined industry contributions (Louisiana and Florida).\nLittle is known, however, about the role of the EHI in the agricultural economy of the Northeast.\n3 To our knowledge, only one peer-reviewed research study examining the economic contribution of the EHI in a northeastern state (New Jersey) has been published (Tavernier, Li, and Thatch, 1995) . These researchers used base IMPLAN data to assess the industry's production side and reported a total contribution of $144 million in employee compensation spread over 10,308 jobs.\nA similar analysis has been conducted in Delaware (Tanjuakio, Madiraju, and Hastings, 1997) . These authors also use the base IMPLAN model, but expand the definition of the industry to include landscape and garden services, and retail and wholesale trade, in addition to production. For 1993, they found the industry generated 4,032 jobs and $102 million in value-added.\nWhile both of the above studies help improve our understanding of the industry, they are subject to scrutiny because they rely on the national coefficients (i.e., nonsurvey) that underlie the IMPLAN database. The national data may not accurately reflect what is happening in the Northeast. Consequently, a survey-based approach can enhance the accuracy of such estimates.\nRecently, Perry and Berg Stack (2000) conducted such a survey of the industry in New England to document sales and growth. While their study provides a good overview of select industry trends, it does not offer a detailed economic analysis of the industry; especially notable is the absence of an analysis of the industry's multiplier contributions.\nAlthough a clearer picture of the growth of the EHI in the region is emerging, additional analysis is needed to document both its historic growth and its overall economic contribution. Because of weather differences, evidence from California and the southern states (where the industry is driven largely by exports) may provide little insight into the northeastern situation where it is largely seasonal and locally focused. Moreover, slower population growth in the Northeast relative to these other areas may affect the nature and rapidity of the industry's future development.\nThis research provides information on the EHI in the northeastern United States by examining three types of data. First, extant secondary data from U.S. government sources are analyzed to provide a general overview of the industry's scope. Second, information from a survey of industry businesses in one northeastern state (Pennsylvania) is analyzed using the IMPLAN input-output model to provide estimates of the direct and secondary economic contributions of the industry in that state. Finally, information from the same survey is utilized to explore the views of participants concerning important issues facing the industry now and in the future."}, {"section_title": "Environmental Horticulture Trends in the Northeast", "text": "As noted in the introduction, the EHI has experienced strong growth relative to other agricultural sectors. In this section we describe recent trends in the industry, drawing on several data sources."}, {"section_title": "Floriculture and Nursery Crops", "text": "The U.S. Census of Agriculture (USDA/NASS) and the Floriculture and Nursery Crops Yearbook (USDA/ERS) provide data documenting the growth of EHI production in the northeastern United States. 12), and had a total annual payroll of $2.2 billion.\nThe importance of sales and services underscores the fact that the EHI is more than plant production. Landscaping services, including design, installation, and maintenance, contribute in important ways to the size and effect of the industry on the region's economy."}, {"section_title": "An Economic Analysis of Pennsylvania's Environmental Horticulture", "text": "As documented in the previous section, the EHI represents an important part of the agricultural economy in the Northeast. The industry generates jobs in a variety of sectors, and farm-level sales have been growing faster than the overall regional average. To date, however, the economic contributions of the industry are not well understood; research on the broader contributions of the industry in both the Northeast region and its individual states is needed. To partially address this void, an economic analysis of Pennsylvania's EHI is carried out using the Pennsylvania IMPLAN IO model, which is extensively modified using data collected in a statewide survey of industry participants. This survey was necessary because data sets such as those described above are marked by several problems. First, they individually consider only certain aspects of the industry, such as production and retail. Second, even in instances where data are gathered, the information is categorized in ways that are not amenable to a study focusing specifically on the EHI. For example, at the retail level, stores such as Home Depot and Wal-Mart are important sellers; yet sales data for these nonspecialized stores are often reported in other categories. Thus, secondary data fail to provide sufficient information for obtaining an adequate picture of the EHI."}, {"section_title": "The Survey", "text": "To obtain information for analyzing Pennsylvania's EHI, a sample of 4,015 units was drawn from the year 2000 listing of all 7,435 certified nursery growers and dealers in the state. The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture (PDA) requires certification for all businesses, organizations, and individuals who sell (retail or wholesale) living plants or parts of plants. Of the total sample, 1,044 units were retail establishments which were part of larger \"chain stores,\" 2,909 were independent dealers or growers, and 62 were not businesses (e.g., youth and school groups, community organizations, conservation districts, and charitable agencies). These \"nonbusinesses\" were removed from the sample.\nSurvey forms were mailed to the 2,909 \"nonchains\" in October 2000, requesting information on their involvement in the EHI, including their major sources of income (sales of green goods and related hard goods, landscape design, installation, and maintenance), gross income, number of employees, total payroll, taxes, and other business characteristics. Participants were also asked their opinions about various issues related to the EHI. In an effort to increase response rates, a postcard reminder followed the initial mailing and, several weeks later, a duplicate survey along with a second request for participation was mailed. Of the 2,909 survey forms mailed to members of the sample, 183 establishments were no longer in business, and 96 were not at the listed address and the materials could not be forwarded. A total of 842 of the 2,630 independent businesses contacted returned usable questionnaires (yielding a 36% response rate).\nFor this analysis, information available from the certification records was used to classify each establishment into one of four type-of-business categories: growers, landscape contractors, garden centers, and distribution/mail order. 5 A comparison (table 3) of the distribution of the various \"types\" in the sample with the total population of \"nonchain\" businesses on the PDA list of certified nursery dealers and growers revealed the sample contained disproportionately fewer garden centers (18%) than did the total population of certified dealers and growers (24%), and somewhat more landscape contractors (32%) and growers or nursery production establishments (48%) than did the population (29% and 45%, respectively).\nIn developing population estimates from the survey data, a three-step procedure was used. First, we determined the averages of employment, wages, sales, and other relevant information (call this y) for each type of business ( j). Recognizing the potential for scale economies, we compiled an \"average-by- sales\" for each of 11 sales ranges (i) for each business type, i.e.,\nwhere n is the number of businesses in a category, and\nIn the second step, a typical \"business profile\" was developed for each of the four types of businesses. To produce this profile (S j ), the average-bysales was weighted by the sample's distribution-bysales (i.e., S j = E( y j ) ( n j /N j ).\nIn the third step, the sample was expanded to the population for each type of business ( p j ) by multiplying assorted facets of the business profile by the type-of-business population in order to derive a category total (T j ) (i.e., T j = S j ( p j ). The effect was a relative weighting to reflect the population distribution,\nThe 1,044 chain outlets in the sample represented 64 separate companies. Because we anticipated that the individual stores would be unable or unwilling to provide the needed data, we telephoned regional or national offices directly. Information was obtained for 266 establishments, representing 26 different chains. Citing company policy, two major retailers-Wal-Mart and K-Mart-refused to participate in the study. For the economic analysis, estimated values for these stores, based on national data sources including those published in Nursery Retailer Magazine, were utilized.\nFurther, recognizing there are differences among the stores, we classified chain outlets into the following categories: grocery stores, convenience stores, home centers and hardware stores, general merchandise stores, and stores specializing in EHI plants and products. Similar to the procedure outlined above, the sample data were weighted by these categories to match the distribution of chain outlets in the population listing (table 3) ."}, {"section_title": "Economic Impacts", "text": "The first goal of the state-level analysis which follows is to highlight the industry's direct contributions to the state's economy, focusing on sales, employment, payroll, value-added, and taxes. The second goal is to quantify the industry's secondary contributions to the state's economy by documenting the multiplier effects of business and employee spending using the 1999 IMPLAN model."}, {"section_title": "Direct Contributions", "text": "Generally, an industry's economic contribution is reported in terms of total sales, employment (expressed as jobs or wages and salaries), and valueadded. Value-added represents the portion of total sales directed to employee income, taxes, rent, and profit. 6 Estimates of the direct contribution of the EHI on the state's economy obtained using the survey data showed the industry generated more than $3.3 billion in total sales in 1999. Highlights include:\nP Sales by growers, landscapers, retail garden centers, and distributors totaled about $3.1 billion.\nP Chain stores sales were estimated at nearly $200 million.\nP Value-added totaled almost $1.5 billion for the industry.\nThe EHI is an important employer in Pennsylvania. Based on the survey results, industry employment in 2000 was estimated at more than 73,000 workers. Findings of note include: P The industry employed approximately 35,000\nfull-time workers.\nP Part-time employment exceeded 12,000 workers.\nP The industry employed more than 25,000 seasonal workers.\nP Total industry compensation and payroll exceeded $1 billion.\nThe survey results further suggest the EHI is a major source of federal, state, and local tax revenues. Growers, landscapers, retail garden centers, and distributors reported paying more than $18.6 million in EHI related taxes. While the data do not allow for quantification of the tax payments of EHI chain stores, they likely are substantial. Furthermore, based on the sales data shown above, the EHI is also clearly an important contributor to state sales tax revenues (currently at 6% of sales). However, an examination of this contribution is beyond the scope of this study."}, {"section_title": "Indirect and Induced Contributions", "text": "Quantifying the direct economic contribution of an industry-as was done above-is the first step in conducting an economic analysis. But an industry's economic contribution is much more substantial when one considers its multiplier effects. These effects are both indirect (the local economic activity created by business purchases) and induced (the local economic activity driven by employee household spending).\nThe IMPLAN model is especially helpful at quantifying the relationships among local industries, as it allows users to examine how the demand for locally produced goods and services affects the output decisions of all local producers. The IMPLAN software and database (described more fully online at www.IMPLAN.com) establishes the characteristics of economic activity in terms of 10 broad industrial groups, involving as many as 528 sectors. In practice, IMPLAN is used in every state and hundreds of communities across the nation to catalog economic activity and predict the effects of alternative policies and various economic changes."}, {"section_title": "7", "text": "The IMPLAN model is based on national surveys of industry and household purchasing patterns. A key feature of the model is that it allows users to estimate the extent to which industries locally purchase those inputs necessary to produce their products. Fully capturing these local inter-industry relationships is an integral function of the model because changes in local industry output are essential to determining the widespread industry contribution of local economic activity. IMPLAN provides information on a number of important aspects of economic change including employment, earnings, income, value-added, and output."}, {"section_title": "Modifications to the Pennsylvania IMPLAN Model", "text": "Although the basic IMPLAN model offers a comprehensive picture of a state economy, the model is not disaggregated enough to examine some key individual sectors in the EHI. In particular, basic data provided for many of the important retail channels through which EHI products are sold (e.g., home centers and discount stores) are just too aggregated to use, with industry sales lumped in with other sales such as hardware or building supplies. Thus, without a survey such as ours, it is not possible to adequately assess the industry's economic contribution. Fortunately, the basic IMPLAN model 6 Technically, adding total sales from any two sectors can involve some double-counting, where one sector's output becomes another sector's input. For example, in Pennsylvania, there are a number of wholesale nurseries that sell to local retail garden centers. If the sales of both the intermediate and final sellers were simply added, it would overstate the true economic contribution of the final sale. Value-added excludes the cost of intermediate inputs, and as such, is a better measure of the net economic gain to the region. 7 In addition to the studies previously cited, Tanjuakio, Hastings, and Tytus (1996) show how the IMPLAN model can be used to estimate the role of agriculture in a state economy (Delaware). These authors do a good job of discussing the fundamentals of the IMPLAN model, database, and software. is quite flexible, allowing users to alter both the basic data set as well as a number of parameters, and in this study we modified the Pennsylvania model using the survey data to describe the specific character of the state's EHI. A brief summary of the key changes is given below.\nThe essence of our modeling effort was to introduce what amounts to a \"hybrid\" IMPLAN industry, which we call the EHI sector. As noted above, this industry is comprised of IMPLAN's Greenhouse and Nursery Products and Landscape and Horticultural Services, and portions of the model's Wholesale Trade, Building Materials and Gardening Centers, General Merchandise Stores, Grocery Stores, and Miscellaneous Retail sectors.\nIn building this hybrid industry, most of our efforts were aimed at refining the value-added and total industry output measures of the basic Pennsylvania model. Using our survey data on industry sales, employment (part-and full-time), and business expenditures on wages and benefits, taxes, and other operating expenses, we were able to construct a detailed expenditure profile for each sector of the hybrid industry. Our survey also asked respondents to report on the extent to which their EHI business plant sales were derived from plants they grew and propagated themselves, versus those they purchased. This was a necessary step, especially at the retail level, because it allowed us to avoid double-counting by focusing exclusively on value-added business activity.\nAnother adaptation worth noting is our recognition that some sectors of the state's EHI purchase inputs from out-of-state suppliers, and our data were further modified so as to separate local and out-of-state purchases. This approach allowed us to modify the regional purchase coefficients (RPCs) of the basic IMPLAN model. For several sectors, these modifications were fairly important. For example, in the basic model, the (average) default RPC for Greenhouse and Nursery Products is 0.55; based on our survey, the (average) RPC for this sector was estimated at 0.81. Similarly, other notable changes in the RPCs occurred for Landscape and Horticultural Services (default average = 0.59; adjusted average = 0.33) and Building Materials and Gardening (default average = 0.95; adjusted average = 0.45)."}, {"section_title": "8", "text": "After making these adjustments, we were outfitted with newly constructed measures of valueadded, which served as the basis for editing the base IMPLAN data on value-added, output, and employment in the sectors of interest.\nWhile the alterations occurred across the board, the primary change worth mentioning is our revision of the Greenhouse and Nursery Products sector. In the 1999 IMPLAN database, this sector was reported to provide about 9,500 jobs, with about $68,000 in output per worker and $15,546 in earnings per worker. Our survey data, however, showed there were far more workers employed in this sector in Pennsylvania (about 29,000), but output per worker ($40,190) and earnings per worker ($10,809) were substantially lower than the IMPLAN database. When discussing these discrepancies with industry experts, our modifications to the IMPLAN model seemed more consistent with their view of the industry, in terms of both size and compensation."}, {"section_title": "Implementing the Modified Pennsylvania IMPLAN Model", "text": "After tailoring the model to Pennsylvania's EHI, IMPLAN was used to estimate the secondary economic contributions of the EHI, employing the three-step procedure outlined in \"IMPLAN Pro Case Studies\" (Minnesota IMPLAN Group, 1997) . For the first step, we created the type II multipliers for the state model. For the second step, we took the hybrid industry's value of production for the year, and divided it by the type I (direct and indirect) multiplier. (This procedure avoids double-counting when examining entire industries, and ensures the direct and indirect effects will sum to the total value of production.) For the third step, this (lower) value was then entered as a new event to \"shock\" the hybrid EHI sector of the IMPLAN model. For the retail trade sectors, the default margins in IMPLAN were applied to the total sales figures so as not to overestimate the contributions of this sector.\nThe results of the IMPLAN analysis are presented in tables 4 and 5, showing both the direct and secondary contributions. It is important to note these estimates are based on the assumption that Pennsylvania residents' current expenditures on EHI products are considered import substitutes. In other words, if these goods and services were not available in the state, residents would choose to import them, rather than spending their money on other in-state activities. In this case, then, the local 8 Users can also modify the production functions in IMPLAN. While we generally found no need to do so, the production function was slightly altered for one industry (wholesale trade). In an IMPLAN-based study of Minnesota's poultry industry, Lazarus, Platas, and Morse (2001) note that the magnitudes of impacts are more sensitive to changes in RPCs than they are to changes in the parameters of the Leontief production function. industry is preventing money from leaking out of the state, and the results can be seen as the additional contribution to the state's economy. 9 Still, because this assumption is strong, the estimates of the secondary effects should be viewed as an upper bound, as some EHI goods and services would surely be imported, but other monies might be spent on substitutes (albeit with a likely loss in consumer surplus). Table 4 reports the industry's contribution to value-added. (Note that the indirect and induced contributions within the industry itself are included as a direct contribution.) In the right-hand column of the table, we show the percentage share of the respective industry totals. P The industry generated nearly $3.3 billion in value-added economic activity, representing about 0.5% of the total Gross State Product.\nP Of this amount, about $1.5 billion is contributed directly, and $1.8 billion is contributed through indirect and induced effects.\nOverall, the results indicate the industry has a valueadded multiplier of 2.2. This means that for every dollar the EHI generated in value-added, $1.20 is generated in secondary (multiplier) contributions."}, {"section_title": "10", "text": "The secondary contribution is largest in the Services and the Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate (FIRE) sectors, which largely reflects industry demand for business and real estate services and employees spending their wages and salaries. Table 5 reports the employment contribution of the industry, as derived from the survey and the IMPLAN model. Here, it can be seen that the industry is an important contributor to state employment. Key findings include: P The Environmental Horticulture Industry supported more than 107,000 jobs, representing about 1.6% of total state employment.\nP Of these jobs, 73,208 were created directly by the industry, while an additional 33,981 jobs were created as the secondary effect.\nP The employment effects of the industry generated more than $2.2 billion in proprietors' and employees' income (including wages and benefits).\nOverall, results indicate an employment multiplier of 1.5. Alternatively, for every job generated by the EHI, an additional 0.5 job was created by secondary (multiplier) effects, mostly in trade and services."}, {"section_title": "11", "text": "In the aggregate, the total employment contribution represents about 1.5% of the state's total employment."}, {"section_title": "A Few Words About Industry Exports", "text": "As noted above, the analysis provided here rests on the assumption that Pennsylvania residents would choose to allocate their EHI expenditures on out-ofstate purchases if the industry was not present in the state. Recognizing this is a strong assumption, we briefly turn our attention to the export side of the industry in order to gain a better understanding of the economic contributions of the industry's out-ofstate sales. This analysis is possible because we asked survey respondents to indicate the portion of their sales to out-of-state buyers. Because it was mostly growers who reported any significant amount of out-of-state sales, we limit our analysis to this category. This information is useful when assessing the potential effects of stepped-up efforts to market EHI products as part of the state's economic development strategy.\nAccording to our survey, 41% of all grower sales were made out-of-state (by comparison, garden centers and landscape contractors reported out-ofstate sales of 5% and 4%, respectively). Using IMPLAN, growers are estimated to contribute, through out-of-state exports, 10,641 direct jobs and 5,638 indirect and induced jobs to the state's economy. In terms of value-added, this represents $140.7 million in direct contributions and $264.5 million in indirect and induced contributions. Translating these contributions into multipliers, we find a type II employment multiplier of 1.5 and a type II value-added multiplier of 1.9."}, {"section_title": "Emerging Industry Issues", "text": "The EHI today faces challenges related to its rapid expansion and unique needs, and an understanding of these can contribute to enhancing the viability of the industry in the future. In our survey, participants were asked to indicate what priority they felt should be given various issues facing the industry. Given similarities in business and industry structure (e.g., size and sales), their responses may be suggestive of general concerns of participants across the Northeast.\nRespondents were requested to indicate whether each of 12 issues was \"not a priority,\" \"low priority,\" \"high priority,\" or \"highest priority.\" The list was developed in consultation with representatives of the Pennsylvania Landscape and Nursery Association (PLNA). To explore differences in responses by different types of industry participants, the answers were tallied separately for 10 It is interesting to note how our results compare to the base IMPLAN model. While we describe above an example of how our estimates of employment and output differ substantially from the base data set (for example, with Greenhouses and Nurseries we found more employment but less earnings per worker), our \"adjusted multipliers\" were slightly higher than those supplied in the base IMPLAN model for comparable sectors. In our hybrid model, the type II value-added multipliers are 2.8 and 2.1 for Greenhouse and Nursery Products and Landscape and Horticulture Services, respectively. By comparison, the default multipliers in the base IMPLAN model are 2.5 and 1.8 for the respective sectors.\n11 Like the value-added multipliers, our employment multipliers for comparable sectors were close to those provided in the base IMPLAN model. In our hybrid model, the type II employment multipliers for Greenhouse and Nursery Products and Landscape and Horticulture Services were 1.5 and 1.7, respectively. In the base IMPLAN model, the default multipliers are 1.7 and 1.4, respectively. growers (n = 407), landscape contractors (n = 270), and garden centers (n = 150). In table 6, the 12 issues are ranked from highest to lowest importance, sorting responses by industry category. The table also reports statistically significant differences among respondent groups. Ranking among the top issues of concern were those dealing with increasing the understanding of policy makers and the public concerning the contributions of the EHI. More than 70% of the growers, landscape contractors, and garden center representatives gave at least high priority to educating legislators and government officials about the importance of the industry to the economy (issue 1); and more than 60% reported that increasing public awareness of the industry (issue 3) should be an item of high priority. Developing industrywide promotion of the industry (issue 6) also was supported by more than half of the respondents. Agricultural economists and cooperative extension staff can assist in achieving these goals by providing detailed industry analyses and educational programming. The publication and use of research directed toward understanding its contributions can bring attention to the current and growing economic and social contributions of the EHI to the region.\nAnother issue receiving a large percentage of high priority ratings concerned the development of improved pest management procedures (issue 2). As this is generally a production-level issue, it was especially important to growers, with more than 80% of the growers viewing it as an important area. Support of this issue was also high (approximately 70%) for the other two respondent groups. Development of new plant varieties (issue 10) is considered important by a somewhat smaller proportion of the respondents, but nearly half reported that this should also be an issue of high priority. New and strengthened partnerships among state and federal departments of agriculture and the land grant institutions can explore new pest management strategies for the industry, and contribute to the development of new varieties of plants.\nResponses to several other issues suggest opportunities for cooperative extension educational programming. A majority of all three industry groups gave high priority to educating industry members concerning advances in horticultural technologies (issue 4). Most growers and landscape contractors were also interested in education targeted to improving farm and business management skills (issue 5). More than 7 out of 10 landscape contractors gave high priority to increasing programs to train EHI workers (issue 7), suggesting the opportunity for workforce development programming.\nThe survey provided some insight into industry views of government regulation. With respect to business operations, establishing professional standards and strengthening licensing requirements (issues 8 and 9) received lukewarm support from growers and garden centers, but were viewed as deserving of high priority by most landscape contractors. Based on personal discussions with industry experts, there seems to be a common feeling among contractors that \"unqualified\" businesses are: (a) damaging the profession's reputation, and (b) taking away business. The issue of relaxing government regulations concerning chemical usage in the EHI (issue 12) received support from only a minority of the industry participants."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions", "text": "Far outpacing the average growth of production agriculture in the Northeast, the Environmental Horticulture Industry has emerged as an important driver of the region's agricultural economy. The industry is an important employer in the region, generating hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in employee compensation. This remarkable growth has been driven, in part, by the rapid economic expansion of the 1990s, as homeowners and businesses increased purchases of EHI products and services.\nThe fact that the industry has shown inflationadjusted growth suggests an area of opportunity for agricultural economic development. Given the increased prominence of land use as an important policy topic in the Northeast, the apparent profitability of the sector, coupled with its relatively concentrated production activities, suggests the industry could help maintain the viability of production agriculture at the urban-rural interface.\nBeyond documenting industry trends, this study also demonstrates the economic importance of the myriad industry activities related to the industry in one northeastern state. Using a modified IMPLAN input-output model, our research shows that the industry contributes to Pennsylvania's economy through more than $3.3 billion in total sales. These sales translate directly into nearly $1.5 billion in value-added income, providing more than 73,000 jobs with total employee compensation exceeding $1 billion. Millions of additional dollars are generated in tax revenues. But the contribution is even more widespread. Our estimates show the industry's secondary effects contribute an additional $1.8 billion in value-added and nearly 34,000 additional jobs to the state economy. Furthermore, the industry brings substantial jobs to the state via exports, with nearly 15% of direct industry employment generated by out-of-state sales.\nThe growth of this industry offers policy makers, state and federal agencies, and land grant institutions a number of promising opportunities for promoting agricultural economic development. In this study several key issues have been identified that are critical to industry members, including outreach to policy makers and the general public, as well as working directly with growers on emerging research issues. In the Northeast, most land grants are seemingly well positioned to deliver research and extension programs that address grower, contractor, and retail needs."}]
