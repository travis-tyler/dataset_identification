[{"section_title": "", "text": "December 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, causes a respiratory illness called COVID-19, which can spread from person to person. 1 cases and 858 deaths in 27 countries during the 2012 MERS outbreak. 7, 8 Coronaviruses are known to circulate in mammals and birds. Previous studies revealed that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic in origin, originally coming from bats, [9] [10] [11] [12] with SARS-CoV spreading from bats to palm civets to humans, [13] [14] [15] and MERS-CoV spreading from bats to camels to humans. 16, 17 Recent research has also reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus likely originated in bats, a proposal based on the similarity of its genetic sequence to that of other known coronaviruses. 18 However, like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and many other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV-2 virus may have been transmitted to humans by an intermediate animal host. 19 Therefore, the identity of the animal source of SARS-CoV-2 remains a key and urgent question. Furthermore, to stem future outbreaks of this type and preventing the transmission of zoonotic diseases to humans should be a top research priority.\nThe existence of an intermediate animal host of SARS-CoV-2 between a probable bat reservoir and humans is still under investigation.\nThe discovery of a virus closely related to the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 in a data set from pangolins sampled more than a year ago illustrates that the sampling of other mammals handled or consumed by humans could uncover even more closely related viruses. 20 During a press conference on 7 February 2020, two researchers (Shen Yongyi and Xiao Lihua) from the South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou identified the pangolin as a potential source of the SARS-CoV-2 virus based on genetic comparison of coronaviruses taken from pangolins and from humans infected during the recent outbreak. By analyzing more than 1 000 metagenomic samples and using molecular biology testing, they found that the positive rate of \u03b2 coronavirus in pangolins was 70% and that the genome sequence of an isolated virus strain was 99% similar to that of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\nThus, whether pangolins acted as a direct intermediate animal host of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is worth further investigation.\nIn the present study, we performed analyses of the transmission dynamics and evolutionary history of the virus based on 70 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 strains sampled from Australia (n = 4), Belgium (n = 1), China (Hubei Province, n = 19; Guangdong Province, n = 16; Zhejiang Province, n = 4; Taiwan, n = 1), Finland (n = 1), France (n = 4), Germany (n = 1), Japan (n = 1), Korea (n = 1), Singapore (n = 3), Thailand (n = 2), United Kingdom (n = 2), and United States (n = 10) with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 3 February 2020. We reanalyzed two of the 21 pangolin metagenome samples from previously published data 20 (Table S1 ).\nTo investigate the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 (between originating animal and human hosts), two samples (SRR10168377 and SRR10168378) obtained from previously reported Malayan pangolin (Manis javanica) viral metagenomic sequencing data (Bio Project PRJNA573298) were downloaded from the NCBI SRA public database. 20 After assembly, the SRR10168377 and SRR10168378 genomes were 16 999 and 6 392 bp in length, respectively. We defined another data set (\"dataset_6\") composed of six genome sequences of coronavirus strains. BetaCoV/Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 (EPI_ISL_402125) was grouped as \"Clade A,\" one (BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013; EPI_ISL_402131) and two (bat-SL-CoVZC45; MG772933 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21; MG772934) SARS-related coronaviruses were grouped as \"Clade B\" and \"Clade D,\" respectively. The two assembled genomes from SRR10168377 and SRR10168377 were grouped into \"Clade C.\" The two data sets (\"dataset_70\" and \"dataset_6\") were aligned using MAFFT v7.222 22 and then manually curated using BioEdit v7.2.5. 23 "}, {"section_title": "| Recombination and phylogenetic analyses", "text": "To assess the recombination of \"dataset_70,\" we employed the pairwise homoplasy index (PHI) to measure the similarity between closely linked sites using SplitsTree v4.15.1. 24 The best-fit nucleotide substitution models for the two data sets were identified according to the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) method with 3 (24 candidate models) or 11 (88 candidate models) substitution schemes in jModelTest v2.1.10. 25 To evaluate the phylogenetic signals of \"dataset_70\" and \"dataset_6,\" we performed likelihood-mapping analysis 26 using TREE-PUZZLE v5.3, 27 with 25 000 to 175 000 randomly chosen quartets for the two data sets.

Likewise, 25.9% of the quartets from \"dataset_6\" were distributed in the center of the triangle, indicating a strong phylogenetic signal ( Figure 1B) . The split network generated for \"dataset_70\" using the NeighborNet method was highly unresolved, and the phylogenetic relationship of \"data-set_70\" was probably best represented by a network rather than a tree ( Figure 1C ).

Both the NJ and ML phylogenetic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 \"dataset_70\" also showed star-like topologies, in accordance with the likelihood-mapping results (Figures 2 and S1 ). The ML phylogenetic tree showed greater star-like topology than the NJ phylogenetic tree, indicating that the ML method was more reasonable for \"dataset_70.\" Root-to-tip regression analyses between genetic divergence and sampling date using the best-fitting root showed that (Table 1) . Furthermore, based on Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis using the tip-dating method, the estimated TMRCA dates and evolutionary rates from \"dataset_70\" ranged from (Table 1) .

We also found that a unique peptide (PRRA) insertion region in the spike protein at the junction of S1 and S2 junction in the human SARS-CoV-2 virus (\"Clade A\") induced a furin cleavage motif (RRAR), which could be a predicted polybasic cleavage site, and thus a unique feature of SARS-CoV-2, in comparison with the other three clades (\"Clade B,\" \"Clade C,\" and \"Clade D\") ( Figure S6 )."}, {"section_title": "| DISCUSSION", "text": "On the basis of \"dataset_70,\" our likelihood-mapping analysis confirmed additional tree-like signals over time compared with our previous results. 46, 47 This result implies increasing genetic divergence of SARS-CoV-2 in human hosts ( Figure 1A) , consistent with the findings of our earlier studies. 46, 47 Split network analysis for SARS-CoV-2 \"dataset_70\" human-to-human transmission ( Figure 1C ). These results are consistent with the ML phylogenetic analyses, which showed polytomy topology from \"dataset_70\" (Figure 2 ). However, NJ phylogenetic analyses showed a more bifurcating tree topology compared with the ML phylogenetic analyses ( Figure S1 ). This is a good example showing the differences between NJ and ML phylogenetic construction methods. \"Dataset_70\" had a minor strong positive temporal signal based on root-to-tip regression and ML dating analyses (Figures 3 and S2) , with the estimated TMRCA dates and evolutionary rates for SARS-CoV-2 found to be nearly identical using both analyses ( Table 1 ). The estimated TMRCA dates and evolutionary rates for SARS-CoV-2 were very similar across different clock models and coalescent tree priors using the tip-dating method. The estimated TMRCA dates and evolutionary rates for SARS-CoV-2 were also very similar across different clock models using the constraineddating method, but highly distinct across the different coalescent tree priors ( Table 1 ). The TMRCA estimated by the tip-dating method was relatively narrower than that determined by the constrained-dating method, consistent with our previous studies. 46, 47 Bayesian analyses with the tip-dating method using a strict clock as well as constant size coalescent tree prior indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is evolving at a rate of 1.24 \u00d7 10 \u22123 substitutions per site per year (Table 1 ), in accordance with our prior research 46, 47 and similar to that found for other human F I G U R E 4 Estimated maximum-clade-credibility tree of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using tip-dating method.

Structure of inferred SARS-CoV-2 transmission clusters from \"dataset_70\" using genetic distances of <0.001% substitutions/site is shown. Nodes (circles) represent connected individuals in overall network, and putative transmission linkages are represented by edges (lines). Nodes are color-coded by sampling locations coronaviruses. 41 Our results also suggest that the virus originated on 24\nNovember 2019, which is in further agreement with our earlier studies. 46, 47 We identified eight phylogenetic clusters (number of sequences 2 to 7) with posterior probabilities between 0.99 and 1.0 using Bayesian inference ( Figure 4) . We also identified six transmission clusters (number of sequences 2 to 23) when the genetic distance between the SARS-CoV-2 strains was <0.001% substitutions/site ( Figure 5) . However, our conclusions should be considered preliminary and explained with caution due to the limited number of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences presented in this study. As more genome sequences become available, there may be stronger among-lineage rate variation over time as to warrant using a relaxed clock model, but we anticipate that the evolutionary rates and TMRCA dates will be broadly similar to those estimated here. As the number of substitutions is still small, it is tempting to speculate that sequencing errors could have a considerable impact on the evolutionary rate and TMRCA date estimates. We removed three SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences (ie, BetaCoV/Wuhan/IPBCAMS-WH-02/2019, EPI_ISL_403931; BetaCoV/Shenzhen/SZTH-001/2020, EPI_ISL_406592;\nBetaCoV/Shenzhen/SZTH-004/2020, EPI_ISL_406595) with potential sequencing errors, but these may have less impact on the above estimates when more substitutions of SARS-CoV-2 are accumulated over time. We also expect that as more SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences become available, the estimated 95% BCIs of the evolutionary rates and TMRCA dates will be narrower.\nWe found that the Pangolin-CoV virus from the two pangolin samples was clustered with the SARS-CoV-2 virus with 100% bootstrap support; however, BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 was more similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus than to the pangolin coronavirus and the human SARS-CoV-2 virus (\"Clade A\") showed a unique peptide (PRRA) insertion not found in the other three clades (\"Clade B,\" \"Clade C,\" \"Clade D\"). This insertion constitutes an RRAR motif in the spike protein at the junction of S1 and S2 junction in the human SARS-CoV-2 virus, after considering the next amino acid (R) of the unique peptide (PRRA) ( Figure S6 ). Of note, the highly favored motifs for furin cleavage are Arg-X-(Arg/Lys)-Arg (RXRR or RXKR), and the minimal motifs for furin cleavage can be RXXR. 48 We also note that some of the other coronaviruses have a furin motif in almost the same location in their spike proteins. 49, 50 Lentiviruses have an RKXR (R, arginine; K, lysine; X, any amino acid) site between gp120 and gp41, cleaved by furin to convert gp160 into subunits. [51] [52] [53] [54] Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that cleavage or lack of cleavage of the spike protein at this site could significantly impact host range and transmissibility. Taken together, the pangolin coronavirus samples (SRR10168377 and SRR10168378) were less similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus than to the BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/ RaTG13/2013 virus and did not have the RRAR motif. Therefore, we concluded that the human SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is responsible for the current outbreak of COVID-19, did not come directly from pangolins. However, due to the limited viral metagenomic data obtained from pangolins, we cannot exclude that other pangolins from China may contain coronaviruses that exhibit greater similarity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\nIn conclusion, our results emphasize the importance of further epidemiological investigations, genomic data surveillance, and experimental studies of the role of the unique furin cleavage motif (RRAR) of SARS-CoV-2 in the spike protein at the junctions of S1 and S2. Such work could positively impact public health in terms of guiding prevention efforts to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission in real time, and to stem future outbreaks of zoonotic diseases."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "This study was supported by a grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31470268) to Prof. Yi Li.
