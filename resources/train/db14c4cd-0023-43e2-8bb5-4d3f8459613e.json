[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Shelf break fronts (SBFs) mark a thermohaline transition frequently observed between relatively shallow continental shelves and the neighboring deep ocean. SBFs are characterized by high phytoplankton biomass, enhanced activity at higher trophic levels [Longhurst, 1998], and sustain intense fishing activity [Heileman, 2009]. Consequently, SBFs may also play an important role in the biogeochemical cycle of carbon of marginal seas [Walsh, 1991;Muller-Karger et al., 2005]. Improving the knowledge of the physical processes associated with SBFs is central to better understand the interaction of these regions with the surrounding ocean and their biological and biogeochemical significance. over the shelf break during spring and summer [Carreto et al., 1995;Romero et al., 2006;Garcia et al., 2008;Lutz et al., 2010]. This is in contrast with the sharp decrease in surface chlorophyll observed in summer in the northern midshelf region due to the combined effect of nutrient depletion during the preceding spring bloom and the development of strong vertical stratification [e.g., Carreto et al., 1995;Romero et al., 2006]. The abundant phytoplankton sustains higher trophic levels, including several economically important pelagic and benthic species [S anchez and Ciechomski, 1995;Rodhouse et al., 2001;Acha et al., 2004;Bogazzi et al., 2005]. The substantial primary production at the shelf break [Garcia et al., 2008;Lutz et al., 2010] promotes the absorption of large quantities of atmospheric carbon dioxide [Bianchi et al., 2005[Bianchi et al., , 2009. The shelf break productivity requires a substantial nutrient flux to the upper layer, but the processes that mediate these fluxes are unknown. The strong linear correlation between temperature and nitrate (r 2 5 0.97) observed over the shelf at 388S suggests that the MC is a significant nutrient source in the northern portions of the shelf [Carreto et al., 1995]. Signorini et al. [2009] have found a nonlinear nitrate versus temperature relationship (r 2 5 0.93) that holds over the shelf and neighboring deep ocean in a wide latitude range ($258S-468S). Thus, influx of nutrients to the outer shelf may be associated with cooling events such as those observed near 418S, which create high peaks in surface chlorophyll a concentration [Piola et al., 2010]. It has also been hypothesized that quasi-permanent shelf break upwelling is associated with a divergence of the MC flow as a result of bottom friction over the sloping bottom, thus leading to nutrient injection to the upper layer [Matano and Palma, 2008]. Recently, high-resolution simulations corroborate these findings and indicate that the upwelling is modulated by the strength of the MC and is insensitive to changes in local wind forcing [Combes and Matano, 2014]. Nevertheless, the physical processes that lead to strong cooling, and presumably nutrient flux into the photic zone, required to sustain the growth of phytoplankton over the shelf break throughout the summer are poorly understood. The purpose of this paper is to investigate these processes by analyzing the variability of water mass properties and currents at the shelf break. Hydrographic and current meter data collected on the PSB are analyzed together with satelliteretrieved sea surface temperature (SST) and surface chlorophyll a concentration (CSAT). The data and methods are described in section 2. Though the study is focused primarily on processes leading to changes in the temperature distribution, to understand their relation with changes in the circulation, the results presented in section 3 include a brief description of the nature of the variability of the currents and water mass structure in the time and frequency domains. In section 4, we discuss the mechanisms leading to temperature variability and concluding remarks are presented in section 5."}, {"section_title": "Data and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Moorings", "text": "The present study is based on the analysis of in situ data collected on two mooring deployments in the northern PSB. The moorings were deployed at the shelf break at 43.88S from 16 October to 5 December 2005 (site A) and at 418S from 25 September 2006 to 8 March 2007 (site B) ( Figure 1 and Table 1). The mooring configuration is presented in Figure 2. It consists of an oceanographic buoy holding a set of atmospheric sensors (air temperature, humidity, and wind speed and direction). The underwater sensors include a hullmounted Sea-Bird temperature-conductivity SBE 37-IM MicroCAT at a nominal depth of 1 m and a downward looking Nortek Continental 190 kHz acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP). During the first deployment at site A, temperature and conductivity were measured at five additional depth levels using Sea-Bird MicroCATs mounted on an inductive cable for real-time data transmission to the surface buoy and satellite telemetry to land (see Table 1). The system configuration during the second deployment at site B was identical except that only the hull-mounted MicroCAT was installed. Data from both sites were transmitted to land every 3 h through a satellite link and hourly data were stored on site. The present analysis is based on hourly recorded data. At both sites, the ADCP measured the current speed and direction of nearly the full water column. Current velocity estimates are based on acoustic backscatter observations from 10 m bins and recorded at 10, 30, 50, 70, 100, 130, and 160 m. Velocity was decomposed into orthogonal long-shore (V) and cross-shore (U) components. Based on the orientation of the continental slope, the reference axes were rotated 208 and 408 from true north at sites A and B, respectively. Except for the determination of coherence and variance spectra discussed in section 3, the velocity components, temperature, and salinity data have been low-pass Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans"}, {"section_title": "10.1002/2015JC011002", "text": "filtered with a cutoff period of 40 h. The filter effectively removes the strong tidal and inertial components observed in some of the original hourly records. The variability retained in the filtered data is referred to as low-frequency variability.\nAqua. High-resolution (twice-daily, $1 km resolution) level 2 data (reprocessing version 2013.1.1) were processed with the standard flags and empirical algorithms (OC3M) [O'Reilly et al., 2000], binned, and mapped to 2 km resolution. Satellite data are distributed by the Ocean Biology Processing Group at NASA (http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov). The areal-averaged nonseasonal SST anomaly (aSST) time series presented in section 3.3.2 is based on 3 day MODIS-Aqua SST composites. The aSST was determined by subtracting the annual and semiannual cycle from the areal-averaged SST. In addition, and since our interest is focused on temperature changes at subseasonal time scales, to remove any additional interseasonal temperature variations, we applied a high-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 90 days. The areal-averaged CSAT time series presented in section 3.3.3 is based on 3 day MODIS-Aqua CSAT composites. To avoid spikes due to cloud contamination, composites with more than 30% of cloud-covered pixels were excluded from the analysis. The resulting time series of aSST and CSAT contains 80% and 65% of valid data, respectively. Gaps in the time series were then filled using a cubic spline interpolation. Daily net surface heat fluxes were obtained from two sources: the Objectively Analyzed Air-sea Fluxes project (OAFlux, http://oaflux.whoi.edu/) [Yu and Weller, 2007;Yu et al., 2008] and the National Center for Environmental Prediction reanalysis (NCEP, http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/-psd/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis. html) [Kalnay et al., 1996].\nAt both sites, the time averaged cross-shore component is 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than the longshore component, indicating that the mean flow is predominantly parallel to the bathymetry. Thus, both records indicate that the flow is strongly steered by the bottom topography, in good agreement with previous observations collected farther offshore, within the MC core [Vivier and Provost, 1999]. The strongest variability is observed at the surface in the cross-shore component of the current at both sites (Figures 4e and 4f). The observed mean near-surface currents at site A ($41 cm s 21 ) is in agreement with estimates based on Lagrangian drifters in the outer shelf near 438S [Piola et al., 2013]. Direct current observations over the 1000 m isobath at 408S present mean velocities of $36 cm s 21 at 274 dbar [Spadone and Provost, 2009]. The magnitude and direction of the latter observations are in agreement with near-bottom velocities (160 m) observed at site B (Table 2). Palma et al. [2008] compared model derived annual-averaged surface currents with the observations at sites A and B and found magnitude and direction discrepancies smaller than 10%, ascribing the discrepancy to a poor bathymetric representation of the shelf break in the model. Direct current measurements collected in the midshelf near 438S showed significantly lower velocities than reported here, with a mean northeastward flow of $10 and 5 cm s 21 at 17 and 67 m depth, respectively [Rivas, 1997]. Such sharp velocity increase in the outer shelf and slope is also apparent in surface drifters [Piola et al., 2013] and models [Palma et al., 2008] and suggests that the flow at sites A and B is strongly influenced by the MC.\n3.3. Cold Events in the Outer Shelf 3.3.1. Anatomy of a Cold Event Relatively intense and vertically coherent low-frequency T and S fluctuations are observed at both sites (Figure 4). For example, a sharp cooling ($0.58C) and salinity increase ($0.1) are observed at intermediate levels at site A in late October 2005. During this event, the surface temperature and salinity dropped below 78C and 33.9, respectively (Figures 4a and 4c). The event is associated with isotherms and isohalines rising $10 m d 21 ( Figure 5). Similarly, an intense temperature decrease of $38C in 2 days is observed at site B during the second half of January 2007. At this time, the salinity increased 0.27, also exceeding 33.9. This event was associated with a vertically coherent acceleration of the long-shore velocity component (Figure 4h). Due to cloud coverage, it was not possible to examine the spatial pattern of the cooling event at site A in late October 2005 based on high-resolution satellite observations. However, inspection of infrared-based and microwave-based SST data ($25 km resolution, AVHRR1AMSR) [Reynolds et al., 2007] confirms that the event was characterized by a relatively weak cooling rate ($0.28C d 21 ). Moreover, the low-resolution SST data also show that the event was localized in the vicinity of the mooring site, over the area where frequent MC intrusions have been observed [Piola et al., 2010] (not shown). Because high-resolution satellite observations are necessary to resolve the spatial scales of the PSB front, to analyze the regional setup, we focus on the event observed at site B in mid-January 2007 ( Figure 4b). MODIS SST composites collected before and during the event are presented in Figures 8a and 8b. South of 458S, the SST patterns near the shelf break present three distinct branches of relative cold waters (SST < 118C, white contour, Figure 8a). Franco et al. [2008] showed that low SST branches create multiple thermal fronts along the shelf break and within the MC. Prior to the development of the cold event, the spatial pattern of the 12.58C isotherm (blue contour in Figures 8a and 8b) suggests that the two onshore branches converge at $448S and extend north as a single cold branch to about 408S, with its axis located offshore from the 200 m isobath. The cold event that developed after 13 January 2007 is also associated with two distinct strips of cold water (SST < 11.58C), with the inshore band now extending to $408S along the 200 m isobath, reaching site B (Figure 8b). The cooled region spanned the outer shelf and shelf break, although the largest cooling is centered over an elongated band extending $500 km along the outer shelf between 398S and 438S ( Figure 8c). Cooling of surface water at rates higher than 20.58C d 21 between the 100 and 200 m isobaths north of 438S is associated with the presence of waters anomalously cold relative to the January climatology (SST < 158C) along the outer edge of the shelf during the event (Figures 8b and 8d). The in situ observations collected at site B and described in section 3.2.1 provide further insight on the time evolution of the cold event of January 2007. The surface temperature time series depicts the intense cooling ($38C) in approximately 2 days (13-15 January), in agreement with the satellite-derived SST rate of change for 13 January (Figures 4b and 8c). The surface waters remained relatively cold ($11.58C) for about a week, and warmed back to >148C after 31 January (Figure 9a). During the low SST period, the surface salinity increased about 0.3, peaked at $33.9, and slowly decreased after the event. The near-surface cross-shore velocity was negative (onshore, $213 cm s 21 ) prior to the cooling period and positive (offshore, $15 cm s 21 ) prior to its termination (Figure 9b). This suggests that cross-shore advection might be partly responsible for the cooling observed in January 2007. The cold event was also characterized by a vertically coherent acceleration of the long-shore component of the flow (Figure 9c). The highest long-shore near-bottom velocities (>40 cm s 21 ) of the 6 months record were observed during this event (Figures 4h and 9c), with maxima exceeding 50 cm s 21 between 60 and 80 m depth (Figure 9c) and an average acceleration at the surface of $2.5 cm s 21 d 21 from 9 to 16 January. To evaluate the impact of the cooling event on surface water characteristics, in situ temperature anomalies at 1 m were determined by subtracting the annual and semiannual cycle fitted to the daily SST data at site B (Figure 4b). The resulting SST anomalies at 1 m shown in Figure 10 plotted against the 1 m salinity exhibit a general negative correlation. The largest negative SST anomalies are observed during the cold event of January 2007 and exhibit the highest surface salinity and deep long-shore velocity of the entire record (S > 33.8, V > 40 cm s 21 , Figure 10b). Though the above observations are consistent with an onshore displacement of the water mass structure and the MC core, as will be discussed in section 4, the cross-shelf flow cannot explain the temperature fluctuations observed at site B during the event.\nto each event. Although there are substantial discrepancies in the magnitude of the net heat flux between these data sets, only two events present estimates with opposite signs (events beginning on 20 January 2005 and 10 February 2008). The remaining events during which both estimates are available exhibit positive (into the ocean) net heat flux, except in April 2009. Five other events with negative NCEP net heat flux estimates are observed after 2009, although no OAFlux data are available for comparison. To investigate the spatial extent of these events, the rate of SST change (@SST/@t) of selected events was estimated using 5 day SST composites and mapped over the study region (Figure 12). Since two consecutive composites are necessary to produce these maps, some of the events depicted in Figure 12 cannot be displayed due to cloud contamination in either composite. All the available events present a cooling rate <20.48C d 21 in the vicinity of the shelf break and onshore of the 200 m isobath (red contour in Figure 12). The net heat flux estimates during the events are either positive or exhibit opposite signs between OAFlux, when available, and NCEP. The largest cooling rates were observed over the continental shelf and upper slope in March 2011 and March 2013. During both events, the ocean lost heat to the atmosphere at rates of 27 and 43 W m 22 , respectively (Table  4). Note, however, the large SSTs decrease over the outer shelf and upper slope (@SST/@t < 20.88C d 21 , white contour and @SST/@t < 21.38C d 21 , yellow contour, Figure 12). Though part of the observed cooling during these two events might be due to heat loss to the atmosphere, below we will show that this mechanism cannot explain by itself the observed cooling rate in the outer shelf.\nTo determine which processes lead to the observed cooling, in addition to air-sea fluxes, horizontal advection and vertical advection are considered. To this end, we evaluate a simplified equation of temperature integrated over the mixed layer depth. Following the formalism proposed by Vialard and Delecluse [1998]: Figure 12. Rate of SST change (@SST/@t, 8C d 21 ) and surface chlorophyll difference over a 10 days period (DCSAT, mg m 23 ) during selected cooling events (see Table 4). Red, white and yellow contours indicate 0.4, 0.8, and 1. Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans where x and y are the cross-shore and long-shore directions, T m represents the mixed layer temperature, U m and V m represent the mixed layer cross-shore and long-shore velocities, respectively, Q 0 is the net heat flux through the sea surface, q 5 1022 kg m 23 and C p 5 3940 J kg 21 8C 21 are the seawater density and specific heat, respectively, H is the mixed layer depth, and T 2H and w 2H are the temperature and vertical velocity at the base of the mixed layer, respectively. To derive equation 1, it is assumed that H is vertically and horizontally homogeneous and constant in time, the temperature and horizontal velocity within the mixed layer are vertically homogeneous, and the horizontal and vertical diffusivities are negligible. We assume H 5 10 m, which is close to the mixed layer depth observed at site A (e.g., Figure 5). As mentioned above, the estimated net heat flux through the sea surface during 13-14 January at site B is positive (e.g., into the ocean, $100 W m 22 ). However, the net surface heat flux required to cause a 38C temperature decrease in 2 days over a 10 m water column is approximately 2700 W m 22 . Thus, whatever mechanism leads to the observed cooling it must also overcome the excess heat input through the sea surface. Note that using a deeper mixed layer implies a proportionally larger heat loss requirement (equation 1). During the cooling period of 13-14 January, the average 10 m velocity observed at site B was almost in the long-shore direction (U m 5 1 cm s 21 ; V m 5 36 cm s 21 ). The estimated cross-shore SST gradient is @T m /@x $ 23 3 10 22 8C km 21 , thus, the cross-shore temperature advection is estimated as U m \u00c1@T m /@x $ 20.028C d 21 . According to equation 1, because U m > 0, the cross-shore advection acts to warm the outer shelf region rather than cool it. The large reservoir of cold water located south of site B (e.g., Figure 8a) suggests that northeastward (long-shore) advection might contribute to the sharp cooling observed at that location. To estimate the long-shore temperature advection, we computed the long-shore temperature gradient from satellite SST @T m /@y $ 22 3 10 23 8C km 21 following a constant ambient planetary potential vorticity contour passing over site B (2.2 3 10 27 m 21 s 21 ) and over a distance of 200 km. Using these values, the long-shore temperature advection is V m \u00c1@T m /@y $ 0.068C d 21 , which accounts for $4% of the observed cooling rate. Moreover, given the observed long-shore SST gradients, for long-shore advection to fully account for the observed cooling rates, a long-shore velocity of 8.7 m s 21 would be required. To estimate the vertical heat advection, the vertical gradient in the third term of the right-hand side of equation 1is estimated using the water column temperature data collected at site A. The averaged vertical temperature gradient at the base of the mixed layer for the last 30 days of the time series is (T 2m -T 2H )/H % 0.0528C m 21 , where we use the temperature at 1 and 10 m depth to evaluate T m and T 2H , respectively. Thus, neglecting all other terms in equation 1, the vertical velocity necessary to generate a temperature change of 21.58C d 21 is Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans\nw 2H $ 29 m d 21 . Though the implied vertical velocity is quite large, this estimate is in agreement with the results derived from realistic numerical simulations in the shelf break region [Combes and Matano, 2014]. Alternatively, we can use the higher vertical temperature gradient observed at station 64 in late March 2006 ( Figure 3b, (T m 2 T -H )/H % 0.1138C m 21 ). The larger vertical temperature gradient requires a somewhat reduced, but still relatively large vertical velocity of w 2H $ 13 m d 21 . We also estimated the Ekman pumping (w E ) at site B between 10 and 15 January 2007 based on the wind stress fields derived QuikSCAT surface winds (not shown). w E is smaller than 1 m d 21 throughout this period, indicating that it does not significantly contribute the inferred vertical velocities. Thus, we conclude that shelf break upwelling is the most likely mechanism leading to the cooling observed in the outer shelf in January 2007. There have been few attempts to estimate the vertical velocities associated with shelf break upwelling from direct observations, the majority of these studies were carried out off the Mid-Atlantic Bight. Based on the Lagrangian velocities inferred from the evolution of dye tracers injected within the bottom boundary layer, Houghton [1997] detected onshore flow on the offshore side of and close to the shelf break front south of Martha's Vineyard. This flow implies convergence within the bottom boundary layer and upwelling of nearbottom waters. A similar experiment yielded upwelling velocities of 4-7 m d 21 [Houghton and Visbeck, 1998]. This estimate is close to the 9 6 2 m d 21 inferred from the distribution of suspended particles and by integrating the near-bottom horizontal velocity convergence observed during a high-resolution hydrographic, optical, and current survey at a nearby location [Barth et al., 1998]. Vertical velocity estimates were also derived from the analysis of the displacements of a neutrally buoyant float leading to a mean alongisopycnal vertical velocity of 17.5 m d 21 over a 2 day period, and maxima of 31 m d 21 between tidal cycles [Barth et al., 2004]. These observations in the Mid-Atlantic Bight are consistent with predictions of the detachment of the bottom boundary layer at the foot of the shelf break front based on numerical simulations [Gawarkiewicz and Chapman, 1992;Chapman and Lentz, 1994]. Recent simulations indicate that upwelling at the shelf break drives an interior secondary circulation and forms a shelf break jet [Benthuysen et al., 2015]. Numerical and analytical models suggest that other mechanisms may play a more significant role in generating upwelling along the PSB [Matano and Palma, 2008;Miller et al., 2011]. Matano and Palma [2008] argued that a combination of bottom friction and lateral diffusion in a slope current flowing in the direction of coastal trapped waves (e.g., with the coast at the left in the southern hemisphere) generates the onshore spreading of the slope current, leading to the development of an along shelf pressure gradient and divergence of the along shelf geostrophic velocity near the shelf break. The divergence of the along shelf flow leads to shelf break upwelling. The model also indicates that the intensity of upwelling is modulated by the strength of the slope current [see also Miller et al., 2011]. Our direct current observations show that the mid-January 2007 cooling event was associated with a coherent acceleration of the flow. Thus, maximum velocities (>60 cm s 21 ) observed in the 60-80 m depth range and near bottom (160 m, >40 cm s 21 ) may have enhanced the upwelling during the January 2007 event. The realistic high-resolution model of Combes and Matano [2014] shows that the time averaged vertical velocity presents intense, $50 km diameter, upwelling and downwelling cells distributed along the shelf break between 478S and 398S. Despite the complex spatial structure of the vertical velocity, the study also shows that its areal average along shelf break strip within the same latitude range is significantly correlated (r 5 0.66) with the transport of the onshore portion of the MC. To assess the impact of upwelling at the shelf break in the model, Combes and Matano [2014] injected a virtual tracer along the shelf break at depths greater than 150 m between 468S and 41.58S and found the tracer emerged at the surface in the outer shelf northeast of the injection region (their Figure 19). The distribution of high tracer concentration in the model resembles the pattern of largest cooling revealed by the in situ and satellite observations described in section 3.3 (Figure 8c). Although our estimated vertical velocity are in agreement with the model results, we point out that the time scale required by the model to produce such an extensive area of upwelled tracer is significantly higher ($180 days) than the time scales observed in site B ($5 days). The analysis of satellite-derived SST anomalies relative to the mean regional SST reveals 16 cooling events, including the event of January 2007 (Figure 11a). The duration of the events ranges from 3 to 18 days. Although it is not possible to evaluate the temperature advection during these events due to the lack of current observations, because long-shore SST gradients and cross-shore velocities are small, both longshore and cross-shore advection appear to be too small to account for the observed cooling rates.

To investigate this hypothesis, the arealaveraged CSAT was estimated over the same region where aSSTs were computed, as detailed in section 2.3. The time series from December to April of each year is presented in Figure 11b. Changes in CSAT (DCSAT) were also determined based on a centered difference over a period of 6 days. Results are shown in Figure 11c. An increasing in CSAT generally follows most of the cooling events (Figures 11a and  11c), although substantial differences are observed. For example, in January 2005, a local CSAT maximum is observed almost simultaneously with a local aSST minimum, whereas a delayed response is observed after the January 2003 cooling event and no clear CSAT response is observed during January 2007 and March 2013. DCSAT associated with intense cooling events are quantified in Table 4. Finally, the spatial distribution of changes in CSAT concentration during selected cooling events was also analyzed. To this end, differences in CSAT concentration before and after each event were computed over a 10 day period using 5 day composites (Figure 12). Note that north of 388S, near-coastal locations may have a significantly contaminated CSAT signal due to dissolved and suspended organic and inorganic matter derived from Plata River discharges. All events exhibit a significant increase of CSAT over the outer shelf (>2 mg m 23 , heavy black contour in Figure 12), although differences in the spatial extent of each event are observed. Interestingly, the events in which there was substantial heat loss to the atmosphere as well as enhanced cooling over the shelf break (i.e., March 2011 and March 2013) also led to noticeable CSAT increment over this region. It must be noted, however, that the cold event of January 2007 described in section 3.2.1 is associated with a general CSAT decrease in the shelf break and somewhat weaker increase in the outer shelf.\n10.1002/2015JC011002 below the seasonal thermocline during the observation period.

In October, the incipient thermocline (and pycnocline, Brunt-V\u20ac ais\u20ac al\u20ac a frequency, N $ 5 cph) is located around 50 m depth and outcrops at the outer shelf break between stations 34 and 35, creating a weak thermal front onshore of the shelf break (e.g., @T/@x $ 21.98C/100 km), and a weakening in vertical stratification (N < 2 cph, Figure 3a). Fluorometer data from a sensor attached to the CTD reveal high fluorescence at the shelf break, with highest concentration in the upper 50 m of the water column, and relative high concentration (>3 mg m 23 ) extending vertically beyond 100 m depth at station 35  Figure 1 for locations). The system configuration at both sites was identical except for subsurface temperature-salinity (T,S) sensors between 10 and 100 m, which where only installed at site A. Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2015JC011002 ( Figure 3e). Satellite-derived chlorophyll a suggests that this feature extends over 1200 km along the shelf break from $508S to 398S (Figure 1). The data collected on 29-30 March 2006 displays a well-developed pycnocline (N > 10 cph), which is most intense in the midshelf region (e.g., station 67, N $ 16 cph) in response to the sharp seasonal warming of the upper layer, and weakens offshore ( Figure 3b). In agreement with previous analyses of seasonal SST variability [Saraceno et al., 2004;Franco et al., 2008;Rivas and Pisoni, 2010], the surface expression of the PSB is more intense in summer (@T/@x > 28C/50 km, Figure 3b). Throughout the year, the salinity stratification over the shelf is weak as a result of a combined effect of low continental runoff, tidal mixing and convective sinking in winter, and strong wind mixing (Figures 3c and  3d) [see also Guerrero and Piola, 1997;Rivas and Piola, 2002;Palma et al., 2008]. However, there is a welldefined offshore salinity increase throughout the year (Figures 3c and 3d In this section, we first describe the variability of temperature and velocity in the time and frequency domains at sites A and B, close to the transition between shelf waters (S < 33.80) and MC water (S > 34). Aside from the progressive seasonal warming displayed in the upper layer in spring, the data at both sites present significant fluctuations, particularly in both velocity components. At site A, the upper 100 m of the water column exhibits a weak thermal stratification from October until early November when the seasonal thermocline develops (Figures 4a and 5a). The base of the mixed layer stabilized at $10 m in mid-November and presented vertical displacements of only a few meters during the remaining of the record. Virtually no net warming was observed at depths >50 m,   (Figure 4c). In addition, vertically coherent T and S pulses at $10 day intervals are observed (Figures 4a and 4c). The amplitude of these fluctuations is $18C and 0.1 in the upper 30 m and decays to $0.48C and 0.04 at 100 m. These salinity variations at fixed levels are associated with large vertical oscillations of isotherms and isohalines, which are particularly intense during the first half of the record (Figure 5). At 100 m, the salinity varies within the 33.75-33.95 range. Given the offshore temperature decrease and salinity increase ( Figure 3), these T and S oscillations suggest intrusion of cold-salty (<5.58C, >33.95) slope waters in the lower layers. Near-surface salinity at site B exhibited variations of 0.08 around 33.7 during most of the record (Table 1). However, in early February 2007, a progressive salinity decrease of 0.008 day 21 reaching minimum values lower than 33.5 was observed. To determine whether such freshening has been previously observed in the region, the historical hydrographic data from the World Ocean Database [Boyer et al., 2013] was inspected. We selected 77 salinity observations within the upper 30 m of the water column in the region between 408S and 458S, located between the 150 and 500 m isobaths and collected during January, February, and March. No water data fresher than 33.78 were found neither in summer nor throughout the year (S > 33.707, not shown). Thus, it is likely that the freshening observed in the last 25 days of the record at site B is at least partly due to a conductivity sensor drift. The velocity time series from three selected levels at sites A and B show a remarkably steady and vertically coherent flow (Figures 4e-4h). Basic statistics for the upper, midlevel, and bottom ADCP velocity bins reveal that the currents are relatively intense at all levels, and somewhat weaker at site B than at site A (Table 2).

Velocity variance spectra from selected levels at site B are presented in Figure 6. Spectra from current records at all levels at site B are presented in supporting information Figure S1. The analysis is carried out on the unfiltered hourly data to retain the high-frequency variations. To increase the stability of the variance estimates, the time series were divided in 15 day pieces and averages at each frequency are presented. Spectral estimates are somewhat more reliable from observations at site B because the record is longer at that location (164 days against 52 days at site A). Though there are some spectral differences, the spectra computed at both sites for data collected during the same time of the year (from mid-October to early December, though in 2005 at site A and in 2006 at site B), and equal record lengths, are in good qualitative agreement. Thus, the results described below are generally representative of the northern shelf break region regardless of the specific location (e.g., supporting information Figures S2 and S3). To quantify the frequency distribution of the horizontal kinetic energy, the variance of both velocity components was summed at each frequency. The total kinetic energy was then subdivided into low-frequency (periods longer than 40 h) and high-frequency band (periods between 2 and 40 h, Table 3). Table 3 also presents variance estimates for diurnal, inertial, and semidiurnal bands. At 10 m depth, both velocity components present sharp inertial, diurnal (K 1 and O 1 ), and semidiurnal (M 2 ) peaks ( Figure 6a). The inertial peak, which dominates the variability at 10 m depth, decreases downward, while the energy in the semidiurnal band in the cross-shore component is vertically coherent. In addition, at both sites, the cross-shore variance at M 2 frequency is consistently higher than the long-shore variance. The velocity variance at diurnal frequency decreases at 100 and 160 m (Table 3) and the O 1 harmonic is somewhat more energetic than K 1 at 100 m for the cross-shore component and at 160 m for the long-shore component. For periods longer than 12 h at 100 and 160 m, the long-shore velocity component is more energetic than the cross-shore   and 6c). At low frequency, the variance of the cross-shore component decreases below 30 m, while the long-shore variance remains relatively high throughout the water column ( Figure  6b). This cross-shore variance decrease with increasing depth is less intense at site B in the 50-100 m depth range (supporting information Figure S2). A more detailed description of the energy partition in the highfrequency bands is provided in the supporting information. To understand the processes causing the temperature variability, particularly the strong cooling events observed at both locations (Figure 4), which presumably also lead to nutrient injection to the outer shelf, it is useful to describe the nature of the thermohaline variations. The temperature variance is high at low frequency and presents well-defined semidiurnal and diurnal peaks, particularly in the upper levels ( Figure 6d and supporting information Figure S4). Though at inertial frequency, the temperature variability decays     Table 3). Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2015JC011002 sharply below 10 m, it is relatively high at diurnal (K1) and semidiurnal frequencies ( Figure  6d). As will be shown below, the semidiurnal cross-shore velocity fluctuations are highly coherent with the temperature variability at all depths. To better understand the nature of the shelf break variability, it is also relevant to examine the relationship between temperature and salinity variations. The coherence and phase spectra at 1 m and at 100 m depth are presented ( Figure 7). No significant coherence is observed at the surface (Figure 7a). This observation indicates that recurrent surface temperature and salinity variations are produced by uncoupled processes, most likely in response to surface heat and freshwater fluxes. As will be shown later, this is in contrast with large amplitude events during which near-surface salinity fluctuations are clearly associated with temperature fluctuations at low frequency. Below 50 m depth and at periods longer than 2 days, significant coherence between temperature and salinity is observed. For example, at 100 m temperature and salinity are significantly coherent over a wide frequency range and exhibit a phase shift of $1808 (Figures 7c and 7d). This is corroborated by the high anticorrelation of unfiltered T and S data at 100 m (20.88). Because the shelf break marks a temperature decrease and salinity increase in the offshore direction (Figure 3), the coherent and 1808 out of phase fluctuations of T and S observed below 50 m (e.g., Figure 7c) could be associated with crossshore exchanges between warm-fresh outer shelf waters and cold-salty slope waters. To test to what extent temperature variations are correlated with local velocity variations, the coherence spectra between temperature and the two velocity components at site A were estimated (Figures 7e and 7g). Temperature fluctuations at 100 m are significantly coherent with both velocity components only at semidiurnal frequencies while coherence at other frequencies and at all levels is marginal or nonsignificant (Figures 7e  and 7g). Since fluctuations of the thermohaline properties are not associated with the variability of the cross-shelf flow, except at semidiurnal frequencies, other processes must induce the observed variations at other frequencies.

To determine if similar events occur in this area, the aSST was estimated over a region of the northern Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2015JC011002 portion of the outer shelf and the upper slope, between 398S and 468S, as detailed in section 2.3 (see Figure 8a for location). The time series of aSST is presented in Figure 11a. The strongest cooling events in terms of SST are detected from late austral spring to midfall. Thus, in Figure 11a, we only present the period from December to April for each year. Several minima associated with sharp cooling events are observed in the time series (aSST < 21.38C, vertical lines in Figure 11a), including the event of mid-January 2007, which manifests itself as a local minimum (aSST $ 22.38C). The rate of the temperature change and the magnitude and duration of each event are presented in Table 4. The duration was computed as the period during which the magnitude of (negative) aSST remained below 70% of the lowest aSST for each event. Because the heat lost to the atmosphere may have a strong impact on the evolution of the SST over the continental shelf [e.g., Rivas and Piola, 2002], Table 4 also presents the net surface heat fluxes from NCEP and OAFlux when available.

To investigate to what extent the cooling in these regions is associated with the same process, we analyze the atmospheric conditions during the event. Figure 13a depicts the atmospheric circulation on 13 January 2007, 1 day before the onset of the cooling event. The pressure and wind fields are derived from the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CSFR; http://cfs.ncep.noaa.gov/cfsr/) [Saha et al., 2010] and Quickscat, respectively. A low-pressure system centered on (588S, 518W) and a high-pressure system located west of South America generated an intense zonal atmospheric pressure gradient, and strong southerly winds (>10 m s 21 ) over the outer Atlantic Patagonian Shelf. This is a distinctive pattern of the year-round atmospheric circulation which causes frequent incursions of cold air in the lee side of the Andes [Garreaud, 1999[Garreaud, , 2000. One consequence of the outbreak of cold air is a significant decrease of the otherwise large midsummer net heat flux into the ocean. In January 2007, the outbreak of cold air caused a reduced heat gain over the shelf north of 468S (Q < 100 W m 22 , Figure 13b). Note that the extended region where heat is lost to the atmosphere is over the southward extension of the Brazil Current, and not over the shelf. Thus, the atmospheric event was not strong enough to overcome the large incoming solar radiation, and the net heat flux over the shelf was into the ocean, except for a narrow band close to shore near 408S (Figure 13b). The net surface heat flux from NCEP presents a somewhat more extended region of heat loss to the atmosphere over the continental shelf ($50 W m 22 , not shown). As will be shown below, this heat loss to the atmosphere would be insufficient to produce the observed cooling. Since the surface heat flux cannot explain the temperature evolution, other processes, such as mixing and advection, must play significant role in the heat balance [e.g., Rivas and Piola, 2002]. Over the region where maximum cooling at the outer shelf occurred, between 398S and 438S, positive net heat flux is observed (Q > 100 W m 22 , Figure 13b). Although enhanced vertical mixing in response to the strong southerly winds may partially explain the sharp surface cooling in this area, the noticeable asymmetry in the intensity of the cooling rates (Figure 8c) suggests that other physical processes must play a significant role in the temperature balance in the outer shelf. OAFlux and NCEP averaged over 3 days prior to each date; DCSAT: surface chlorophyll difference (mg m 23 ) over a 6 days period. Events indicated in bold are depicted in Figure 12. Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans"}, {"section_title": "CSAT Response to Cooling Events", "text": "Cold events plausibly associated with shelf break upwelling may generate a nutrient flux that enhance phytoplankton growth over the outer continental shelf. Increased CSAT is observed after most of the cooling events when distributions of SST rate of change are available (Figure 12). Some of these events show a remarkable coincidence between areas of sharp cooling and increasing CSAT (e.g., January 2003 andFebruary 2008). DCSAT maps also indicate enhanced chlorophyll a increase in the vicinity of 418S during cold events, a region characterized by maximum nonseasonal surface chlorophyll variability [Piola et al., 2010]. Our results show that 75% of the analyzed cooling events are concurrent with a CSAT increase (Table 4). On average, the chlorophyll concentration increased 1.0 mg m 23 during the identified events, however, DCSAT values are highly variable between events. Moreover, events with similar cooling intensity exhibit opposite CSAT response. For example, during the December 2003 event, where aSST 5 21.978C, the observed CSAT increment was of 1 mg m 23 . On the other hand, the January 2007 event (aSST 5 22.288C) is associated with a CSAT decrease of 1.1 mg m 23 . During both events, NCEP and OAFLUX estimates of net heat flux were positive. The vertical structure of chlorophyll a does not seem to explain these differences. Vertical sections occupied north of site B ($398S) in late spring and summer present a maximum chlorophyll a at the seasonal thermocline, which outcrops offshore [Carreto et al., 1995, Figures 2 and 8]. Thus, chlorophyll a is nearly homogeneous through the upper $40 m of the water column offshore from the 100 m isobath, the region of largest observed cooling. A plausible explanation for such differences is that chlorophyll may respond to other environmental conditions, such as vertical stratification, and to different phytoplankton species present at the time of the event. Thus, similar cooling events may effectively promote or depress the response of phytoplankton."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Simultaneous in situ observations of temperature, salinity, and velocity profiles from two mooring deployments have been used to identify mechanisms leading to temperature variability in the northern Patagonian continental shelf break. Our results indicate that temperature and salinity fluctuations are not locally associated with either the cross-shore or the long-shore velocity component, except at semidiurnal frequencies at 75 and 100 m, thus implying a net offshore heat flux and onshore salinity flux below the thermocline. Our analyses indicate that the mean cross-shore heat flux below 80 m depth associated with the M 2 frequency represents 60% of the total mean cross-shore eddy heat flux. Significant coherence is observed between temperature and salinity at time periods longer than 18 hs, suggesting that cross-shelf exchanges between warm-fresh shelf water and cold-salty slope water occur at the shelf break. Relatively intense and vertically coherent low-frequency T and S fluctuations are observed at both sites. The analysis of in situ temperature, salinity, and velocity data together with satellite-derived SST observations provided evidence of upwelling at the outer shelf and upper slope during a cold event recorded in January 2007. SST data indicate that the decrease in surface temperature extended $500 km along the outer shelf. By evaluating a simplified temperature balance at the mooring site, we found that neither the cross-shore exchanges nor the heat exchanges between the atmosphere and the ocean account for the observed cooling rate. Instead, a vertical velocity of 29 m d 21 is necessary to sustain the recorded decrease in surface temperature. This value is in agreement with vertical velocities estimated in recent realistic numerical simulations in the shelf break region. The vertically coherent acceleration of the long-shore flow observed during the cooling event is also in agreement with numerical model results, which suggest a positive correlation between the intensity of the shelf break upwelling and the strength of the onshore portion of the MC. Other cooling events over the outer shelf and shelf break were detected as nonseasonal SST anomalies minima. These events are also characterized by enhanced cooling in the shelf break region, and given the observed surface heat flux exchange with the atmosphere, it is likely that shelf break upwelling events account for the observed decrease in SST. The impact of the upwelling events on nutrient enrichment was also analyzed using CSAT as a proxy for biomass growth. Our results show that 75% of the analyzed cooling events are concurrent with a CSAT increase over a period of 5 days after the cooling events. Moreover, some of these events show a remarkable coincidence between areas of sharp cooling and increasing CSAT. Nevertheless, differences in CSAT response suggest that phytoplankton communities respond differently to similar cooling events. In summary, our results indicate that shelf break upwelling is in large part Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 10.1002/2015JC011002 responsible of the observed cooling events and subsequent nutrient enrichment processes on the PSB. Continuous measurements of currents and physical properties and dedicated physical-biogeochemical models will be essential to obtain a better understanding of the Patagonian shelf break dynamics and its interaction with the local ecosystem."}]
