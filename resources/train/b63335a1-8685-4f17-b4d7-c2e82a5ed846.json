INTRODUCTION", "text": "In 2010, a report by the U.S. Government Accountability Offi ce (GAO) set off a heated debate by alleging unscrupulous recruiting practices and fraud in the federal fi nancial aid programs at several large for-profi t colleges (GAO, 2010) . In response, the Department of Education instituted controversial new rules which specifi ed that for-profi t institutions could maintain eligibility for federal student aid programs only if their students met strict income-to-debt ratios and loan repayment rates (Federal Register, 2011) .\n1 Although questions of for-profi t college cost and quality are central to the debate over the regulations, few empirical estimates of these measures exist.\nIn this paper, I fi rst provide a summary and analysis of the economics of for-profi t higher education, highlighting studies that have contributed to our understanding of the sector. I focus on for-profi t institutions that offer two-year and less-than-two-year certifi cates and degrees, which comprise the vast majority of this sector. These institutions provide education and training to thousands of low-and middle-skilled workers every year and are the primary target of the Department of Education's proposed regulations.\nI next assess the social costs and benefi ts of the two-year, for-profi t, higher education sector. I generate a rough estimate of the annual per student cost to taxpayers of federal and state grant aid, appropriations, and contracts fl owing to these institutions, as well as the cost of defaults on federally subsidized student loans. I also estimate the out-of-pocket educational expenses and foregone earnings of for-profi t students. I fi nd that for-profi t two-year colleges cost taxpayers roughly $7,600 per year for a full-time equivalent student, while students bear most of the cost of their education, in the form of foregone earnings, tuition, and loan interest amounting to $51,600 per year. I perform sensitivity analyses for variations in the most uncertain parameters. My estimates of the total costs to students and taxpayers of for-profi t education range from $52,000 to $65,000 per student per year. These fi gures correspond to total costs for the for-profi t sector of $14 billion to taxpayers and just under $100 billion for the 1.8 million students enrolled in these institutions each year.\nI contrast these costs with similar estimates for public community colleges, including the direct subsidization of this sector by state and local taxpayers. I fi nd that community colleges cost taxpayers more than for-profi ts -about $11,400 per year -but that students incur only about $32,200 in costs per year of attendance. Considering both public and private costs, community colleges are thus roughly $15,600 less expensive per student per year than for-profi t colleges. In aggregate, taxpayers spend $75 billion supporting the 6.6 million community college students in the United States.\nI also calculate the future earnings gains necessary to fully offset the costs to students and taxpayers in each sector. For for-profi t students, earnings gains of 8.5 percent or more per year of education would result in positive net benefi ts -a fi gure that is somewhat higher than recent studies of the returns to for-profi t institutions (Cellini and Chaudhary, 2011; Turner, 2011) . In contrast, students in community colleges require a minimum increase in earnings of 5.3 percent per year of schooling to break even. Thus, relative to community colleges, for-profi t higher education appears to be less expensive for taxpayers, but much more costly for students and society as a whole.\nThe paper proceeds as follows. Section II describes the economic research on forprofi t colleges, highlighting studies that focus on the supply and demand for for-profi t education, the impacts of fi nancial aid policy, and student outcomes. Section III describes the data and the methodology of my cost-benefi t analysis, Section IV discusses the valuation of costs, and Section V describes the benefi t calculations. Section VI presents extensions and policy implications, while Section VII concludes."}, {"section_title": "II. THE ECONOMICS OF FOR-PROFIT EDUCATION", "text": "There is surprising little economic research on for-profi t postsecondary education given its prevalence. The primary reason is that few publicly available educational data sets explicitly identify for-profi t institutions and students. Nonetheless, new data sources and methods have led to signifi cant strides in our understanding of these institutions in recent years. In this section, I review the economic literature on for-profi t postsecondary education, highlighting what we know about these institutions as well as the gaps in the literature. I divide the literature into four broad categories: studies of the supply side of the market, focusing on for-profi t institutions; demand-side studies emphasizing student characteristics; research on fi nancial aid policy; and studies of for-profi t student outcomes."}, {"section_title": "A. The Supply Side: For-Profi t Institutions", "text": "Research on the institutional behavior of for-profi ts can be divided into two primary lines of inquiry: the size and growth of the sector, and competition between the public and for-profi t sectors.\nRemarkably, generating a count of the total number of for-profi t institutions in the United States has eluded researchers until recently. The reason is that the U.S. Department of Education only tracks schools that are eligible for federal fi nancial aid programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act and, as recent research shows, this misses a substantial number of for-profi t institutions. Further, assessing the growth of the sector over time -even just the growth in aid-eligible institutions -was nearly impossible until recently because it was not until the late 1990s that the Department of Education made an effort to track down all aid-eligible for-profi t institutions (Cellini, 2009 ). This effort, as well as new data sources on non-aid eligible institutions, is for the fi rst time allowing economists to fully assess the size and growth of the sector. Cellini and Goldin (2012) provide the fi rst comprehensive assessment of the total number of for-profi t institutions in the United States. Using data from the regulatory agencies of fi ve states, we fi nd that institutions that are not federal aid-eligible outnumber aid-eligible institutions. Overall, we estimate that there are 7,550 for-profi t institutions in the United States, serving 2.5 million students. Of these, 2,940 institutions and 1.8 million students are Title-IV eligible and refl ected in offi cial Department of Education counts.\nDeming, Goldin, and Katz (forthcoming) explore the growth of the sector. Focusing on federal aid-eligible institutions in the Department of Education data, they document the tremendous growth of for-profi t education over the last decade. Enrollment in aid-eligible for-profi ts now accounts for about 11 percent of all enrollment, up from just 4 percent in 2000. This growth is largely driven by chains and on-line institutions. Deming, Goldin, and Katz (forthcoming) report that aid-eligible for-profi ts currently confer 42 percent of all postsecondary certifi cates, 18 percent of associate's degrees, and 5 percent of bachelor's degrees.\nSeveral theories regarding the growth of for-profi t higher education are explored in a chapter by Breneman, Pusser, and Turner (2006) , in an excellent volume on for-profi t higher education edited by the same authors. On the supply side, the authors point to several innovations implemented in the for-profi t sector that have contributed to lowering the costs of education provision, allowing opportunities for greater profi ts. Examples include online learning, variable tuition pricing, and the use of non-tenured faculty. These supply-side innovations have allowed for-profi t institutions to capitalize on increased demand for education, particularly among older, non-traditional students, as they respond to labor market conditions and the rising returns to education and training over the last few decades.\nFor-profi ts also appear to respond strongly to the demand for education among the traditional college-age population. In the same volume, Turner (2006) explores the differential growth of for-profi ts across states, fi nding a strong correlation between the percentage change in the population ages 18 to 24 and for-profi t growth rates. States like California, Colorado, and Arizona witnessed the largest growth in both college-age population and for-profi t enrollment between 1995 and 2000. Turner further details the distribution of degrees offered by for-profi t institutions by fi eld of study. As expected, public and non-profi t institutions offer a much higher percentage of associate's and bachelor's degrees in arts and sciences and liberal/general studies, while for-profi t degree programs are concentrated in business, health professions, engineering-related technologies, and computer science. She attributes the for-profi t focus in these areas on several factors, such as: skills in these fi elds are relatively easy to certify (e.g., through exams or job placement), practitioners are capable of teaching the necessary skills, physical plant requirements are minimal, and interdisciplinary training is not necessary for success.\nDespite these differences in the proportion of degrees awarded in various fi elds, Turner (2006) , Cellini (2009), and Bailey, Badway, and Gumport (2001) all document substantial overlap between the degrees and certifi cates offered in the for-profi t, public, and not-for-profi t sectors, particularly at the two-year college level. In California, for example, my previous work demonstrates that in most fi elds, including business, construction, health, and technical trades, the number of associate's degree and certifi cate programs offered in the for-profi t sector is roughly equal to the number of programs offered in the public sector in the average county.\nThe degree of program overlap drives another strand of economic inquiry that focuses on the extent and nature of competition between for-profi t colleges and other sectors. Bailey, Badway, and Gumport (2001) argue that although there is overlap between the degrees and certifi cates offered by public community colleges and for-profi ts, because of the small number of for-profi t schools and students, any competition between the two sectors is negligible. Their contention is based on the U.S. Department of Education's data in the 1990s, and therefore undercounts the number of institutions and students; nonetheless, the numbers of institutions and students were still likely quite small. Moreover, their in-depth case study of a multiple-branch for-profi t school and local community college indicates that community college administrators generally do not view for-profi t schools as competitors. The authors conclude that the existence and success of for-profi t schools is not likely to exert a signifi cant negative effect on community college enrollment.\nIn Cellini (2009) , I provide the fi rst causal evidence that public and for-profi t two-year (and less-than-two-year) colleges do, in fact, compete for students. I use a regression discontinuity design based on close votes on community college bond measures to control for unobservable tastes for education that may bias ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates. My results reveal that when public community colleges receive increased funding and media attention with the passage of a bond measure, students switch from for-profi t colleges to community colleges, driving some for-profi t colleges out of the market. The magnitude of the effects in each sector are remarkably similar, suggesting strong competition between for-profi ts and community colleges. The timing of the reaction also suggests that students may not have full information about two-year college options."}, {"section_title": "B. The Demand Side: Student Characteristics", "text": "An understanding of the demand side factors infl uencing the size and growth of forprofi t education requires an understanding of the characteristics of the students attending these institutions and how these students differ from students attending public and non-profi t institutions.\nTwo studies in the 1980s fi nd that private two-year college students are more likely than public community college students to be women, minorities, and come from lower-income and less-educated families (Apling, 1993; Cheng and Levin, 1995) . More recent studies suggest that these patterns persist (Bailey, Badway, and Gumport, 2001; Cellini, 2005; Chung, 2009a; Rosenbaum, Deil-Amen, and Person, 2006) . Chung (2009b) uses a multivariate analysis of student-level data from the 1988 National Education Longitudinal Study to study differences in the characteristics of for-profi t students and those in other sectors. She fi nds that for-profi t students have less parental involvement in their education, higher levels of high school absenteeism, and are more likely to be young parents than students in other sectors.\nDeming, Goldin, and Katz (forthcoming) corroborate the patterns found previously, exploiting new data on fi rst-time college freshmen from the 2004/09 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study. For-profi t students in this sample are more likely to be female, black, and Hispanic relative to students in other sectors. Compared with those in community colleges, for-profi t students are disproportionately single parents, have much lower family incomes, and they are almost twice as likely to have a general education diploma (GED), rather than a high school diploma.\nAll of the aforementioned studies rely solely on U.S. Department of Education data on students in institutions that are eligible for federal fi nancial aid programs. Studentlevel data on ineligible institutions are not available, but studies based on more inclusive data, such as the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, fi nd similar patterns of female and minority attendance. However, as might be expected, the more inclusive set of institutions reduces disparities in household income between for-profi t and community college students (Cellini and Chaudhary, 2011) ."}, {"section_title": "C. The Impact of Policy: Financial Aid", "text": "The biggest difference between for-profi t and public colleges is undoubtedly their price: required tuition and fees for public community colleges average just $2,136, while for-profi t, two-year colleges charge over $10,000 more, averaging $13,725 in 2008-2009 (National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), 2010). Because of their higher tuition, and due to the fact that aid-eligible, for-profi t institutions attract (or recruit) a large numbers of students who come from low-income families, for-profi t institutions receive a disproportionate share of federal student fi nancial aid under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. In addition, suggestions that the for-profi t industry is overly reliant on revenue from aid programs and allegations of fraud and abuse in fi nancial aid have plagued the sector and driven policy in the last few years (GAO, 2010; Federal Register, 2011) . In light of these allegations, studies of the impact of fi nancial aid policy on student and institutional behavior are critical in developing sound public policy.\nDeming, Goldin, and Katz (forthcoming) point out that for-profi ts account for 24 percent of Pell grant disbursements and 26 percent of federal student loan disbursements even though they enroll only 12 percent of students. Further, they point out that federal grants and loans received under Title IV of the Higher Education Act account for the vast majority of funding that these colleges receive. In 2008-2009, federal aid program accounted for 74 percent of the revenues of Title IV-eligible, for-profi t institutions (Deming, Goldin, and Katz, forthcoming) .\nIn the fi rst quantitative study to address the relationship between fi nancial aid and for-profi t enrollment, Turner (2005) shows that Pell Grant recipients are more likely to enroll in for-profi t institutions than in public and non-profi t institutions in response to cyclical labor market fl uctuations. Specifi cally, she fi nds that as unemployment rates and public tuition rise, enrollments of Pell Grant recipients in for-profi ts rise, while enrollments decline with increases in state appropriations.\nIn Cellini (2010) , I assess the impact of the federal Pell Grant program, the GI Bill, and California's Cal Grant program on for-profi t college openings and closings. I ask whether the generosity of these programs infl uence the net number of for-profi t colleges in a market. I fi nd that for both Pell and Cal Grants, increases in the per-student maximum award encourage for-profi t college entry. The relationship is particularly strong in counties with high adult poverty levels, where more students are eligible for aid. This paper provides the fi rst evidence that federal and state fi nancial aid policies have signifi cant impacts on for-profi t college behavior.\nIn more recent work, Cellini and Goldin (2012) test the \"Bennett Hypothesis,\" which suggests that the availability of federal fi nancial aid may induce some for-profi t institutions to raise tuition above the cost of education. To answer this question, we compare the tuition in programs and institutions that are eligible for federal aid under Title IV against observationally similar programs that are not eligible. We fi nd that aid-eligible institutions charge about 73 percent more than similar ineligible programs, and this effect does not appear to be driven by differences in college quality.\nExtending work on the relationship between fi nancial aid and enrollments in forprofi ts, Darolia (2011) uses a dynamic regression discontinuity design to assess whether institutions that lose federal fi nancial aid eligibility experience lower enrollment and slower enrollment growth than similar institutions that narrowly miss cutoffs for eligibility for Title IV. He fi nds that enrollment levels and growth rates both decline substantially for schools that lose eligibility, and that these effects are particularly strong among forprofi t institutions. Moreover, he fi nds that the effect is attributable to a decline in the number of new students rather than existing students transferring to other institutions."}, {"section_title": "D. For-Profi t Quality: Student Outcomes", "text": "The issue of the quality of a for-profi t education is a central concern for both students and policymakers. If for-profi ts institutions are providing high quality education to underserved students, then their reliance on federal aid may be warranted and even desirable. Conversely, if these institutions fail to provide benefi ts to students suffi cient to offset their costs, then public support through federal aid programs may be unjustifi ed.\nEconomic theory suggests that the best measure of education quality is the labor market return, or the growth in earnings, that can be attributed to a student's education. Over the past half-century, an expansive body of literature has developed to measure the returns to education. Reviews of the literature by Card (1999) , Ashenfelter, Harmon, and Oosterbeek (1999) , and Kane and Rouse (1995a) report that one additional year of schooling causes earnings gains in the range of 6-9 percent, depending on the method, sample, and time frame of the analysis, while more recent and better identifi ed analyses reveal much higher returns, averaging 10-15 percent per year (Card, 2001; Goldin and Katz, 2008) . The vast majority of the research in this area has focused on high school and four-year college returns, with relatively few studies emphasizing differences in various sectors and levels of schooling (Ashenfelter, Harmon, and Oosterbeek, 1999) .\nVery few studies have generated credible estimates of the private return to education for for-profi t students. Three studies have generated cross-sectional comparisons of average earnings, rather than gains, of for-profi t and community college students (Grubb, 1993a; 2 Chung, 2008; Deming, Goldin, and Katz, forthcoming) . Chung controls for selection on observable characteristics and Deming, Goldin, and Katz implement propensity score matching, but none can control for unobservable student characteris-tics that might bias cross-sectional estimates. Nonetheless, these studies generally fi nd no or few differences in earnings between students in the two sectors. Conditional on employment, Deming, Goldin, and Katz fi nd no earnings difference, but when they include students with zero earnings, for-profi t students appear to have 8-9 percent lower earnings than students in other sectors.\nIn Cellini and Chaudhary (2011), we generate what we believe to be the fi rst causal estimates of the earnings gains to two-year private (mostly for-profi t) institutions. We use a student-level fi xed effects approach to control for time-invariant unobservable characteristics of students in the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. We fi nd no statistically signifi cant difference in the returns to associate's degrees and vocational certifi cates in private institutions relative to community colleges. Both sectors generate earnings gains of around 8 percent per year for students who complete associate's degrees and do not continue onto four-year colleges.\n3 At most, point estimates, though insignifi cant, suggest that the earnings gains might 1-2 percentage points higher for forprofi t students. Among students who attend for-profi ts but do not complete degrees, we fi nd returns of about 6 percent per year and no signifi cant differences between sectors.\nBuilding on this work, Turner (2011) draws on income tax data to implement a similar student fi xed effects approach to assess the differential return to attendance in for-profi t and not-for-profi t institutions. Turner's data allow him to look at older students and students in both two-and four-year institutions. His preliminary results reveal that earnings gains are about 8 percent lower in for-profi ts, relative to not-for-profi ts. He obtains small negative, but imprecise, estimates of the absolute return to a for-profi t education.\nLabor market returns are undoubtedly the central concern of economists studying the quality of education, but other student outcomes may reveal the mechanisms through which for-profi ts affect student earnings and shed light on the types of educational services that are of most value in the labor market. Deming, Goldin, and Katz (forthcoming) offer cross-sectional OLS and propensity score estimates of a host of other student outcomes. Conditional on observable characteristics, they fi nd that for-profi t students are more likely to default on student loans, are more likely to be unemployed, and are more likely to leave school because of \"dissatisfaction.\" Cellini and Chaudhary (2011) fi nd no discernable differences in the likelihood of being employed or being in fulltime employment across sectors. Much more research on student outcomes is needed, particularly on degree completion and transfer rates of for-profi t students."}, {"section_title": "III. COSTS AND BENEFITS OF A FOR-PROFIT EDUCATION", "text": "Despite the renewed research interest in for-profi t colleges, few academic studies have attempted to conduct cost-benefi t analyses in the sector. 4 Early versions of Chaudhary (2011) and Turner (2011) included rough estimates of the costs and benefi ts to students and/or taxpayers, but to date, there has been no comprehensive comparison of the costs of the for-profi t sector relative to the public sector. In the remaining sections of the paper, I provide such a valuation. Several caveats are in order. First, I generally draw on the U.S. Department of Education's data on revenues, expenditures, and student aid. Therefore, my cost estimates only include the costs to taxpayers and students of aid-eligible programs in for-profi t colleges. Since these institutions receive all federal Title IV funds, which are a large part of the costs of taxpayer costs of for-profi ts, omitting non-aid eligible institutions will not impact my assessment of federal taxpayer support, but may cause me to understate the burden on state taxpayers if non-Title-IV eligible institutions receive substantial state aid. Second, given the substantial heterogeneity in for-profi t colleges, I focus on comparing the costs of two-year for-profi ts with the costs of public two-year community colleges. I would ideally like to compare the costs of educating a student in an associate's degree program in the two sectors, but the Department of Education data limits my analysis to institutions that offer two-year degrees as their highest degree. 6 As such, many students in these institutions may actually pursue less-than-two-year degrees or certifi cates. Moreover, a large portion of students in for-profi ts classifi ed as four-year institutions, which are omitted in my base case analysis, are actually pursuing two-year degrees -but the same is not usually true for not-for-profi t and public four-year colleges. As a result, my estimates of tuition and debt may be understated. I consider students in four-year for-profi ts in an extension below.\nThird, I leave out of my analysis any effects accruing to for-profi t institutions themselves. A true social cost-benefi t analysis should account for all costs and benefi ts accruing to these institutions (and there are undoubtedly large positive profi ts for forprofi t colleges), but the relevant policy question is whether the benefi ts to taxpayers and students outweigh the costs to these groups.\nFinally, I begin my analysis by evaluating the average costs associated with educating one full-time, full-year student for one year in a two-year, for-profi t college, relative to a baseline assumption that the student does not attend any other postsecondary education. I carry out the same calculation -the costs and benefi ts for a full-time student relative to a baseline of no college -for a community college student for comparison. Of course, many, if not most, students in two-year colleges work while in school and attend only part-time (Scott-Clayton, 2012) and others may be unemployed, causing me to overstate the opportunity cost of attendance. However, as long as both community college and for-profi t two-year students are equally likely to attend part-time (Cellini 2009) , the differential costs between the sectors should be unaffected. Further, the full-time calculation avoids assumptions (due to a lack of data) about the number of hours worked by students in each sector. Finally, given that I consider two-year programs, all fi gures should be doubled to assess the costs associated with the completion of an associate's degree."}, {"section_title": "7", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "IV. VALUING COSTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. Financial Aid", "text": "The most controversial aspect of the for-profi t sector is undoubtedly its reliance on federal student aid programs. To assess the cost of this support for both for-profi t, twoyear colleges and their public counterparts, I draw on data provided in NCES (2010), Table 355 . I look separately at grant aid and loan aid, as grant aid goes directly to institutions and represents a direct cost to taxpayers, while loans (or more specifi cally, the interest on those loans) accrue to students, with the exception of defaults. I calculate the value of student loan defaults accruing to taxpayers separately.\nA few details of the fi nancial aid calculations merit discussion. Since the NCES fi gures of average grant and loan amounts are calculated only for aid recipients, I multiply the average awards accruing to each recipient by the percentage of full-time, full-year students receiving each type of aid (federal and non-federal, grants and loans) to arrive at estimated costs per student. I use these \"effective\" grant and loan amounts for all subsequent calculations (e.g., defaults and interest).\nAn additional complication is that grant aid is not listed separately for two-year, for-profi t institutions, but rather combines two-year institutions with four-year institutions. To better isolate aid amounts for for-profi t two-year institutions and in order to be conservative, I average the amount listed for \"two-year and above\" for-profi t institutions with the lower amounts presented for \"less-than-two-year\" institutions. The idea is that two-year institutions offer associate's degrees as their highest degree, but both private and public two-year colleges also offer less-than-two-year certifi cate and diploma programs. It is also worth noting that a high percentage of students in four-year institutions actually pursue two-year degrees. To the extent this occurs, my calculations will underestimate the cost to taxpayers of two-year, for-profi t colleges. Grant aid is reported separately for two-year public institutions.\nFederal grant aid includes all Title IV grants as well as programs administered through the Department of Defense and Veteran's Affairs (e.g., GI Bill). As shown in the fi rst row of Table 1 , under the base case (representing the most plausible values of all parameters), federal grant aid averages $2,376 per full-time-equivalent student in a two-year, for-profi t college. In the fi rst row of Table 2 , the same value is calculated for public community colleges. Federal taxpayers pay $1,272 in grant aid for each student in the public sector. Note that all values are calculated as one-year values, so students attending for two years would cost taxpayers twice this amount.\nFederal loans include Stafford, Perkins, and PLUS loans. 8 In the base case, I use a 35 percent default rate for for-profi t institutions. This fi gure refl ects the cumulative lifetime default rate over 10 years, as calculated by the U.S. Department of Education, based on the cohort of students entering repayment in 1997. For the public sector, in the base case, I use the analogous 10-year cumulative lifetime default rate of 26 percent. Source: Author's calculations using data from NCES (2010) . See text for detailed explanation of calculations. 1 Educational expenses (\"edex\") include books and supplies.\n8 PLUS loans are parental loans, but I attribute them to students for simplicity. 9 The Department of Education spreadsheet can be downloaded from FinAid (2011). The 15-year default rate rises to 40 percent for for-profi ts and 31 percent for community colleges (as reported on fi naid.org, but not verifi ed with Department of Education data). Finally, two-year cohort default rates (based on students, rather than loans) reveal rates of 12.5 and 8.4 percent for the for-profi t and public two-year colleges, respectively (available from the Department of Education). I use these values in sensitivity analysis.\nTo monetize the impact of defaults, I multiply the average total student loan amount in each sector by the relevant default rate (one might interpret this as each student having a probability of default equal to the average default rate). I then multiply this fi gure by 0.9, under the assumption that a student defaults on 90 percent of his total loan amount. I vary this assumption in sensitivity analysis.\nI am able to separately identify average institutional aid in each sector: $38 for twoyear for-profi ts and $1,007 per full-time-equivalent in a community college, based on expenditure data (NCES, 2010, Tables 378 and 373, respectively). For for-profi t colleges, I subtract this amount from non-federal grant aid reported by NCES, which includes state, private, employer, and institutional aid, since the goal is to refl ect only taxpayer and student costs in the analysis (i.e., I exclude profi ts and costs to for-profi t institutions). In Table 1 , non-federal grant aid therefore includes only state, private, and employer aid. In Table 2 , for community colleges, I leave institutional aid in the nonfederal grant aid calculation, since it accrues to taxpayers. However, to avoid double counting, I subtract institutional aid from total direct expenditures for community colleges (discussed below). For simplicity, I attribute the full cost of non-federal grant aid to state taxpayers, although some portion undoubtedly is covered by the private sector."}, {"section_title": "B. Direct Public Expenditures", "text": "Student aid is not the only mechanism through which taxpayers support for-profi t education. Data on for-profi t revenues refl ect sizeable federal, state, and local appropriations, grants, and contracts (NCES, 2010, Table 369 ). As shown in Figure 1 , outside of federal aid (which is captured in the \"tuition\" category in the fi gure), for-profi t two-year colleges report receiving a sizeable $1,736 per student from federal sources -more than three times federal support of community colleges. Support for for-profi ts through state and local appropriations, grants, and contracts amounts to another $171 per student (NCES 2010, Table 369 ). It is clear that these federal funds do not include student aid programs, but I can fi nd no other details on the programs and sources of this funding.\nSource: NCES (2010 , Tables 362 and 369 This fi gure may include funding secured through federal job training programs under the Workforce Investment Act and others. To assess the degree to which the federal government, states, and local areas support public community colleges, I report grants and appropriations from each level, as revealed in NCES (2010 , Table 362 ) and displayed in Table 1 . I assume that local revenues include annualized per-student funding from voter-approved infrastructure bonds and other local sources.\nRevenues, however, may not fully refl ect the costs to taxpayers of providing public education. I therefore include as a cost to state taxpayers the balance of expenditures per full-time-equivalent student (net of the federal and local revenue sources, counted above, as well as tuition and institutional aid). For community colleges, this balance amounts to $4,337 and includes instructional expenses (including salaries and wages), research, public service, academic support, student services, institutional support, operation and maintenance of plant, capital depreciation, auxiliary enterprises, and other items.\nFigure 2 displays expenditures for both the for-profi t and public sector. Community colleges spend much more on instruction than for-profi t institutions ($12,000 vs. $4,000). For-profi ts spend more on student services, academic, and institutional support ($7,000 vs. $4,000). Notably, for community colleges, total revenues and expenditures differ only by about $840. Among for-profi t colleges, the difference is larger, suggesting a profi t of about $2,187 per student."}, {"section_title": "10", "text": "Finally, one cost that I do not value for either sector is the cost of capital. For for-profi t colleges, one would want to account for rental costs, assuming that the institution is a traditional \"brick-and-mortar\" institution, rather than an online entity.\n11 For community colleges (which also offer a mix of brick-and-mortar and online delivery), the relevant capital cost is the opportunity cost of public land. One plausible approach to valuing the opportunity cost of public land is to use private sector rental rates, as these represent their best foregone alternative use (Boardman et al., 2011) . For this reason, at least for brick-and-mortar classroom space, per-student capital costs may be comparable in the two sectors. Non-instructional facilities, such as gyms, pools, etc., may push the cost of capital higher for public institutions. However, operation and maintenance of these facilities is already included in my calculations of expenditures above."}, {"section_title": "C. Student Costs", "text": "The largest cost to students is undoubtedly the earnings they forego while in school. I assume, for simplicity, that the students enrolling in the private and public two-year colleges are demographically similar. To the extent that for-profi t students are more likely to be women and minorities, my calculations may overstate foregone earnings of students in the for-profi t sector. I address this in the sensitivity analysis below.\nTo calculate foregone earnings of full-time students in either sector, assuming they would have worked full-time if not attending, 12 I average two sets of earnings from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. I use the median weekly earnings of individuals age 16-24 ($443 per week) averaged with the median earnings of individuals age 25 and over who have a only high school diploma ($618), since a high proportion of students in both sectors are non-traditional age.\nOther costs to students include tuition, fees, educational expenses, and room and board. I draw on NCES (2010 , Table 345 ) to obtain these costs for two-year for-profi ts ($24,669) and two-year public institutions ($7,567) for students attending in-state institutions in [2008] [2009] . To avoid double counting, in Table 1 I report tuition, fees, educational expenses, and room and board net of effective grant aid, which is already attributed as a cost to federal taxpayers and state taxpayers.\nFinally, since students largely rely on loans to pay for tuition and educational expenses, I include the interest paid on the average effective student loan amount (calculated as noted above by multiplying the average loan amounts by the percentage of students taking out those loans) as an additional cost to students. 13 For federal loans, I base my interest calculations on a 6.8 percent interest rate, the rate applied to both subsidized and unsubsidized federal direct Stafford loans in 2007-2008. 14 I assume a 1 percent origination fee and repayment over 10 years. I use the student loan calculator available at www.Finaid.org to calculate the interest owed based on these parameters. 15 For nonfederal loans, I apply a conservative 10 percent interest rate, based on the average of a typical range of 6.75 to 12.75 percent for private student loans (FinAid, 2011) . Based on these calculations, for-profi t, two-year colleges cost students $3,354 in interest each year, compared to $98 for public sector students."}, {"section_title": "D. Base Case Cost Analysis", "text": "As reported in Table 1 , in the base case, for-profi t institutions cost society about $59,200 per full-time equivalent student. Most of this burden falls on students, who incur $51,600 in costs, or 87 percent of the total. Foregone earnings are, of course, the largest cost of attendance for students, but tuition, fees, educational expenses, room and board, and the interest on loans used to pay these expenses, amount to about $26,600 (or 52 percent of the total cost) for students in for-profi t institutions.\nTaxpayers fund the remaining $7,600 in costs, of which 78 percent -or $6,000 -comes from federal sources. Federal student aid programs and loan defaults account for about $4,200 per student (70 percent of the federal funding). Federal appropriations and grants to institutions account for another $1,700.\nComparing for-profi t costs to public sector costs in Table 2 , I fi nd that a community college education costs society roughly $43,600 per full-time equivalent student, or about $15,600 less than a for-profi t education. Costs to students amount to $32,200, almost $20,000 less than for their for-profi t counterparts. Net tuition, educational expenses, and interest are only about $5,600, or 17 percent, of the student's cost, as the bulk of the cost to students is foregone earnings.\nTaxpayers pay about $11,400 for a full-time equivalent student in a community college, about $3,800 more per student than for a for-profi t education. Of this total, state and local taxpayers fund the majority of community college expenditures, covering 69 percent of the total or $7,700 per student. Still, federal taxpayers pay about $3,600 for a community college student, 42 percent of which comes through federal student aid. Figure 3 reveals the difference in the total costs to taxpayer and student costs in the two sectors graphically. Figure 4 reveals differences by source of funding. Federal support for for-profi ts is much higher than for public sector institutions, but state and local funding for community colleges outstrips for-profi t support. Figures 5A and 5B break federal funding down into its components in the two sectors. Despite the policy focus on loan defaults in the private sector, these comprise only 31 percent of the federal spending on for-profi ts. In the public sector, defaults account for just seven percent of federal spending. Grant aid accounts for 40 percent of the cost to federal taxpayers, and appropriations, grants, and contracts account for the remaining 29 percent of federal support in the for-profi t sector."}, {"section_title": "E. Sensitivity Analysis", "text": "To test the sensitivity of my assumptions, I re-calculate for-profi t costs under both a best-and worst-case scenario. I report these estimates in columns (2) and (3) of Table 1 .\nUnder the best case scenario, I assume that for-profi t students have a lower opportunity cost of attendance than community college students. This may be the case, if, for example, for-profi t students are disproportionately minority, female, or young. I therefore use the lower of my two earnings estimates, the median for young people age 16-24 ($443) . This is conservative estimate, considering that the median earnings for One of the most uncertain parameters, and one that has a signifi cant impact on the analysis, is the percentage of students receiving loans and grants, which is used to calculate effective per-student aid costs. In the base case, I used the average proportion listed for \"two-year or more\" institutions and \"less-than-two-year.\" In my best case scenario, I rely on the lowest proportion listed for either of these two levels of education, in order to lower the burden on taxpayers to the lowest possible levels. In the worst case scenario, I use the highest proportion. Notably, a higher proportion of less-than-two-year students receive federal grants, presumably due to the inclusion of veteran's benefi ts (72 percent vs. 60 percent). But a much higher proportion of two-year-or-more students take out federal loans (93 percent vs. 69 percent). This proportion impacts all of the aid variables in the analysis.\nI use two-year cohort default rates (12.5 percent) in the best-case scenario and 15-year cumulative lifetime default rates in the worst case scenario (40 percent). Finally, I vary the proportion of the student loan that is not paid back under default. In the best case, I assume 70 percent of the total amount, and I use 100 percent in the worst case.\nAs shown in Table 2 , the results of analysis yield a best-case cost to society of $52,100 and a worst-case cost of $65,500. Even under the best case scenario, the costs remain well above the base case community college costs of $43,600. Under the best case scenario, taxpayers pay only $5,200 per full-time equivalent students, compared to about $9,900 under the worst case -still about $1,500 less than the taxpayer burden of community colleges."}, {"section_title": "V. VALUING BENEFITS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. Private Returns to Education", "text": "The costs of both sectors, of course, need to be evaluated relative to their benefi ts. The most obvious benefi t for students and society generally is the gain in earnings that students experience as a result of their education. As noted above, very few studies have"}, {"section_title": "Figure 5A", "text": "Federal Support for For-Profi t Two-Year Colleges\nFigure 5B generated credible estimates of this private return to education for for-profi t students. At best, the research suggests the returns to for-profi ts are about 6 percent per year for students who attend with or without completion, which is similar to community college returns (Cellini and Chaudhary, 2011) . At worst, for-profi ts may result in zero gains or even losses (Turner, 2011) . Rather than relying on either of these estimates, in Table 3 , I instead calculate the magnitude of returns needed to offset student and taxpayer investments in for-profi t education under the base case costs described above. Assuming annual earnings of $30,900 (the average earnings of adults over age 25 with no college), 16 a 30-year career, and a discount rate of 3 percent, I calculate the present value of lifetime earnings of an individual with no college to be $664,000. Comparing this to the $51,600 of student costs, a return of 8.5 percent return per year of education would be needed to fully offset the cost of one year of education incurred by the student. Including taxpayers in the calculation would require a 9.8 percent return. These fi gures are substantially higher than returns to for-profi ts estimated in Cellini and Chaudhary (2011) , but they remain barely within the 95 percent confi dence interval.\nThe comparable fi gures for community college returns are considerably lower. Under the same set of assumptions, students in community colleges require a return of 5.3 percent to offset their costs, while society requires a 7.2 percent return. These estimates are well below the returns to community colleges estimated in Cellini and Chaudhary (2011) and other well-identifi ed studies of public sector returns (Jepsen, Troske, and Coomes, 2010; Jacobson, Lalonde, and Sullivan, 2005) . "}, {"section_title": "B. Social Returns to Education", "text": "Although earnings gains, or private returns, are typically the largest benefi ts of college education, they are by no means the only benefi ts. The social returns to education refl ect externalities to human capital accumulation that benefi t other members of society in a number of ways.\n17 First, more educated workers may increase the productivity of those around them if, for example, less-educated individuals learn by interacting informally with better-educated colleagues. Second, more educated individuals may be less likely to engage in criminal behavior, saving substantial costs to society. Third, better educated individuals may be more engaged in civic life, leading to more informed voting behavior and better public policy.\nThe literature on social returns to education is much smaller than the literature on private returns. As is the case in studies of private returns, research on social returns must overcome a number of empirical challenges to generate plausibly causal estimates. A few notable papers have addressed these challenges. To assess the magnitude of productivity spillovers, Moretti (2004) compares similar industrial plants in cities with different proportions of college-educated workers. He fi nds that a 1 percentage-point increase in the share of workers with a college education results in a 0.5-0.7 percent increase in productivity, holding all else equal. Lochner and Moretti (2004) fi nd evidence that education reduces crime. They estimate the magnitude of the social savings from reduced crime to be 14-26 percent of the private return to education. Evidence on civic participation also reveals a strong link. Dee (2004) uses an individual's proximity to two-year colleges (private and public) as an instrument for college attendance to assess the causal impacts of education on civic participation. He fi nds that college attendance increases voter participation by 17-22 percentage points.\nDespite some credible evidence of social returns to college education generally, there are no studies that differentiate between the social returns to various types of colleges. It might be expected that education in the public sector generates greater civic participation as students become more invested in the fate of their college. For example, in California, voters routinely vote on bond measures to support infrastructure improvements in their local community colleges. Differences in productivity spillovers and reductions in crime between sectors are less obvious. Because of the lack of evidence, any valuation of differential social returns between for-profi t and public two-year colleges would be little more than speculation, so I omit it from my calculations."}, {"section_title": "C. Other Benefi ts", "text": "Beyond private and social returns to education, colleges may generate additional benefi ts to society outside of their educational services. Community colleges may have recreational or other facilities that are open to the public. For example, public colleges often offer low-cost or free access to gyms, athletic fi elds, pools, or libraries that may generate substantial value to the community. For-profi t colleges are less likely to offer reduced-cost services to the broader community, and may not even have recreational facilities or libraries. Additional societal value may be generated from faculty or student research, although this is not a traditional function of either private or public two-year colleges, and thus is likely to be small in both cases.\nExpenditures on research and public service in the two sectors may provide an indication of the relative importance each sector places on these activities, but these values do not, of course, refl ect the willingness-to-pay for these services in the broader community. As shown in Figure 2 , for-profi t, two-year colleges spend just $8 per student on research and public service combined, compared to $196 per student spent by community colleges.\n18 Community colleges spend an additional $1,500 per student on capital (depreciation and operations and maintenance). Comparable values are not calculated by NCES for for-profi ts, but are included along with other expenses in a category called \"other\" that averages $1,200 per student. Again, these values do not refl ect the value to society of these facilities to the community, which may be a particularly important consideration for community colleges.\nAnother benefi t to society not previously discussed is the corporate tax revenue collected from for-profi t colleges. Corporate tax receipts offset some portion of the cost to taxpayers of a for-profi t education. Accurate estimates of the per-student tax liability of for-profi t institutions are diffi cult to obtain, but cost estimates presented by the University of Phoenix suggest a corporate tax liability of about $625 per student (de Alva, 2010) . Projections of the tax liabilities of two-year colleges derived by consultants for Kaplan, Inc. suggest corporate tax revenues of $485 per student (Shapiro and Pham, 2010) . Including these (potentially overstated) estimates in the analysis would not result in a substantial change in my estimate of the taxpayer burden associated with for-profi ts and would do little to close the gap in the total societal costs between the private and public sectors.\nFinally, to the extent that college attendance results in increased earnings, students in both sectors would also pay more in personal income taxes and be less reliant on public assistance. Apart from any distortionary effects, these taxes and subsidies represent a benefi t to society, but a cost to students: I therefore consider them a pure transfer in this analysis. Moreover, without more accurate estimates of earnings gains, it is unclear how taxes and public assistance would differ across sectors."}, {"section_title": "VI. EXTENSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. Aggregate Estimates", "text": "The analysis thus far has focused on per-student costs and benefi ts, but an understanding of the aggregate costs to taxpayers and students of the for-profi t sector merits discussion. Title IV eligible two-year and less-than-two-year for-profi t institutions enroll roughly 624,000 students, based on fall enrollment counts. Using the fi gures calculated in the base case, this implies aggregate costs to society of $37 billion per year. As noted above, most of this cost accrues to students as foregone earnings, but taxpayers contribute $4.8 billion to two-year, for-profi ts annually.\nIf we assume that four-year college students accrue roughly the same costs as twoyear students, then we can extrapolate costs to the 1.2 million students in four-year for-profi ts. As noted above, since the four-year designation applies to the highest degree offered by an institution, many students listed as enrolled in four-year institutions are actually enrolled in associate's degree or non-degree programs within those institutions. These students may face similar opportunity costs, and possibly similar tuition and debt levels relative to students in two-year institutions. To the extent that four-year students (including those in bachelor's programs) pay higher tuition and assume additional debt, my estimates based on two-year college costs will underestimate the costs to taxpayers and students of these students.\nTaking all 1.8 million students enrolled in federal aid-eligible, for-profi t institutions into account, I estimate total social costs at $106 billion, with $14 billion accruing to taxpayers and $92 billion to students. In contrast, the 6.6 million students enrolled in community colleges, together incur $214 billion in costs with taxpayers paying $75 billion.\nTo assess the plausibility of the for-profi t fi gures, it is useful to compare the taxpayer burden to spending on federal student aid programs. Offi cial reports of federal expenditures on Pell Grants reveal that $4.3 billion was spent on students in for-profi t institutions in 2008-2009 (U.S. Department of Education, 2011). In addition, GI Bill funds accruing to for-profi ts account for another $1.6 billion (U.S. Senate HELP Committee, 2011). The remaining $8 billion difference is attributable to student loan defaults, a myriad of other grant aid programs, and the somewhat vague albeit large category of \"federal appropriations, grants, and contracts\" described above."}, {"section_title": "B. Policy Implications", "text": "In light of the vast amount of money spent by students and taxpayers on for-profi t colleges and the limited evidence of their effectiveness, it seems appropriate to consider whether further regulation of the for-profi t industry can be justifi ed. The U.S. Department of Education's new gainful employment regulation will undoubtedly cause some forprofi t institutions to close, but the magnitude of this effect is unclear. The Department of Education suggests that about 3 percent of aid-eligible for-profi t programs would lose eligibility (Federal Register, 2011) , while opponents of the regulation suggest that 7 percent (or more) would lose eligibility (Guryan and Thompson, 2010) . It is not clear whether the analogous proportion of institutions would close, or whether some might continue to operate without Title IV eligibility (see for example, Cellini and Goldin, 2012) , making these impacts even more uncertain.\nFurther complicating analyses of this policy is the uncertainty regarding the extent to which community colleges could and would absorb students from the for-profi t sec-tor. If community colleges have the capacity to add students from the for-profi t sector, the gainful employment regulations may save students substantial costs, but require increased investment from taxpayers. On the other hand, some taxpayer savings would also result from the reduction in grant aid and loan defaults in the newly-ineligible programs. Still, it is not clear whether students in ineligible schools will be absorbed by community colleges or whether they will forego their education altogether."}, {"section_title": "VII. CONCLUSION", "text": "Research on the economics of for-profi t education is still in its infancy but, like for-profi t colleges themselves, the fi eld is rapidly growing. Over the last few years, we have learned much about the responses of for-profi t institutions to fi nancial aid and competition with the public sector, and have fi nally generated an accurate estimate of the number of for-profi t institutions in the country. We are beginning to learn about student outcomes, and have the fi rst few estimates of labor market returns.\nStill, there are few data sources on for-profi ts, so estimation of the costs of a forprofi t education remains a challenge, and defi nitively assessing its benefi ts is even more diffi cult. My estimates of the social costs of education in the for-profi t sector suggest that the costs to taxpayers of educating a student in a for-profi t institution are roughly $7,600 per year per student. Students incur annual costs in excess of $50,000 in foregone earnings, tuition, and loan interest in two-year for-profi t institutions. Although taxpayer costs are almost $4,000 higher in the public sector, the combined costs for students and taxpayers suggest that community colleges are roughly $16,000 per student per year lower than their for-profi t counterparts. To cover their personal costs, for-profi t students need to generate earnings gains of at least 8.5 percent per year of education. By comparison, community college students require earnings gains of only 5.3 percent to obtain net benefi ts from their education.\nThese fi ndings suggest that unless the private and social returns to for-profi t education can be shown to be substantially higher than the returns to a community college education -which the current literature does not support -then many students would be better off in lower-cost community colleges. Given the large tuition differences between the two sectors, the student savings that could be realized by a switch to the public sector appears to outweigh the greater taxpayer burden of public education.\nThis analysis, however, omits several important costs and benefi ts of for-profi t institutions, not least of which are their profi ts earned by for-profi t institutions. I also omit the social benefi ts of education and the externalities associated with research, public service, and the use of college facilities by the broader community. Further, state budget cuts may render community college expansion politically infeasible for the foreseeable future and changes to tuition and fi nancial aid programs will alter the estimates presented above. As the research on for-profi t education develops, more detailed assessments of the costs and benefi ts of a for-profi t education can and should be undertaken."}]
