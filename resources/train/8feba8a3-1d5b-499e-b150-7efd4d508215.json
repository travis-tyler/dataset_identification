Several features render adiponectin an attractive and tractable biomarker for large epidemiologic studies, such as its long half-life, high ex vivo stability, and minimal diurnal variability [8, 9] .\nWhile adiponectin levels are highly heritable (30-70%) [10, 11, 12] , several well-designed studies have shown variable association between common polymorphisms in the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ), possibly due to small sample sizes and different panels of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), ethnicities and clinical outcomes [12, 13, 14] . This has lead some observers to call for a more complete and systematic characterization of the genetic determinants of adiponectin levels [12] .\nOur study therefore sought to address 2 questions: first, what are the common genetic determinants of adiponectin levels both at ADIPOQ and elsewhere? And second, do the variants robustly associated with adiponectin levels influence metabolic traits and risk of metabolic disease?\nTo comprehensively assess the influence of common genetic variation on circulating adiponectin levels, we undertook a largescale meta-analysis of 3 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for circulating adiponectin levels from population-based cohorts (n = 8,531 participants). From this first stage, we chose SNPs most strongly associated with adiponectin levels (P,10"}, {"section_title": "24", "text": ", n = 250), and tested these for their association with adiponectin in 5 additional population-based cohorts (n = 6,202).

Since adiponectin is an adipocytederived circulating protein which has been inversely associated with risk of obesity-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) and coronary heart disease (CHD), we next sought to understand if the identified variants influencing adiponectin levels also influence risk of T2D, CHD, and several metabolic traits. In addition to confirming that variation at the ADIPOQ locus influences adiponectin levels, our analyses point to a variant in the ARL15 (ADP-ribosylation factor-like 15) locus which decreases adiponectin levels and increases risk of CHD and T2D. Further, this same variant was associated with increased fasting insulin levels and glycated hemoglobin. While the function of ARL15 is not known, we provide insight into the tissue specificity of ARL15 expression. These results thus provide novel insights into the physiology of the adiponectin pathway and obesityrelated diseases.\ntowards higher HOMA-IR (P = 0.01, n = 24,188) and HOMA-B (P = 0.02, n = 24,130) ( Table 4 ).

We identified that ARL15 was expressed most abundantly in skeletal muscle at a level 4-fold that of the mean of all other tissues, with adipose expression detectable but low ( Figure 3 ). Using biopsied tissue from insulin-sensitive tissues (liver, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue) in healthy volunteers, immunoblots confirmed ARL15 expression in skeletal muscle, although it was detectable in all 3 tissues (Figure 4 )."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "By conducting a GWAS for the adipocyte-derived protein adiponectin, we have identified a novel susceptibility variant in ARL15, which is associated with lower adiponectin levels and increased risk of T2D and CHD. Our results also help clarify which variants at ADIPOQ influence adiponectin levels, thus expanding our understanding of the adiponectin pathway.\nARL15 is widely expressed [20] . However its function is unknown, and there have been no phenotypes previously associated with this gene. Based on its predicted protein sequence, ARL15 is structurally similar to ADP-ribosylation factors and Ras-related GTP-binding proteins which play key roles in the regulation of intracellular vesicle trafficking [19] , and which have been specifically implicated in insulin signaling and insulin-stimulated glucose transport [21, 22, 23, 24] . Our preliminary data demonstrate that ARL15 is expressed in insulinresponsive tissues, including adipose tissue. Interestingly, expression was highest in skeletal muscle, which is the main site of insulinmediated glucose disposal, but which does not synthesize adiponectin. Thus, ARL15 is a good candidate to be involved in cellular insulin resistance and/or adiponectin trafficking and secretion. Its implication in metabolic diseases by a non-hypothesis-based genetic approach provides strong impetus for further functional studies. Table 2 . Relationship of SNPs achieving genome-wide significance for their association with adiponectin levels (n = 14,733 from the 8 studies in Table 1 ). Our study sheds further light on the role of ADIPOQ SNPs on adiponectin levels -which has been the source of several inconsistent reports [12, 13, 14, 25 Table 3 . Association of genome-wide significant SNPs with risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and coronary heart disease (CHD) (n = 10,128 for T2D; n = 22,421 for CHD). previously associated with adiponectin levels at ADIPOQ, the rs1648707 SNP achieved genome-wide significance in our analysis for adiponectin. rs1648707 is in moderate linkage disequilibrium with rs266729 (r 2 = 0.74), which has previously been associated with adiponectin levels, but not consistently with T2D [12] . We did not assess rare variants, and were thus unable to test the association of rs17366743 (minor allele frequency = 0.075) with adiponectin levels, which has been previously associated with T2D and with fasting glucose, but not with adiponectin levels [13] .\nInterestingly, ADIPOQ SNPs that showed genome-wide significant associations with adiponectin levels did not show associations with T2D or CHD. This raises the question of how ARL15 interacts with adiponectin to influence disease risk. The demonstrated relationship of ARL15 with the metabolic traits and diseases may represent adiponectin-independent effects of ARL15 -a hypothesis that could be tested by adjusting the relationship between ARL15 and CHD or T2D for adiponectin levels (which was not possible in this study, as the disease cohorts had no measured adiponectin levels). Alternatively, recent evidence suggests that adiponectin may be influenced directly by insulin exposure [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] , allowing adiponectin to act as a surrogate marker for integrated total insulin exposure as a result of its stable half-life and relatively low diurnal variability. Consequently, ARL15 may be an upstream mediator of the relationship between insulin and adiponectin, and may thus impact upon T2D and CHD through an insulin-dependent pathway which involves, but is not entirely dependent upon, adiponectin. In addition, since we demonstrated that the ARL15 variant was associated with adiponectin levels across all age ranges, including children in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort, this variant likely affects lifelong adiponectin levels, which may influence its relationship with T2D and CHD.\nIn conclusion, this study expands our understanding of the genetic influences on adiponectin levels. We have implicated a novel locus, ARL15, in the regulation of adiponectin levels and clarified the role of variants near ADIPOQ on adiponectin levels. Finally, we provide further evidence that the variant at ARL15 may influence risk of T2D and CHD, thus providing impetus for further study of ARL15."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "We undertook a GWAS to detect SNPs which were associated with adiponectin, and tested the physiologic and clinical relevance of these SNPs by assessing their association with indices of glucose homeostasis and BMI in European populations, and with T2D and CHD in large clinical cohorts (Figure 1 )."}, {"section_title": "Ethical Considerations", "text": "All studies including biopsy of liver, skeletal muscle or adipose tissue from healthy volunteers for immunoblotting studies were approved by institutional ethics review committees at the relevant organizations.
