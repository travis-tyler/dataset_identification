Over the past two decades, the subject has received increased attention as scholars have sought to explain the growing wage gap between skilled and unskilled U.S. workers and the decline of the U.S. manufacturing sector. 1 This paper focuses on a related but distinct issue. We analyze human capital adjustments in response to trade-driven changes in labor market conditions. In particular, we employ the methodology developed by to examine changes in U.S. public high school graduation rates in the face of increased competition from Chinese imports between 1990 and 2007. Controlling for a wide range of potentially confounding demographic, economic and educational factors, we nd that as import competition increased, labor market opportunities deteriorated for individuals without a high school degree, and local high school graduation rates rose. Our most restrictive estimates imply that moving from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile in the distribution of changes in import exposure would have increased a local labor market's graduation rate by 3.64 percentage points between 2000 and 2007. To our knowledge, this is the rst paper to empirically link the graduation rate to international trade in the U.S.\nOur identication strategy is motivated by the asymmetric eect that China's export growth has had on regional labor market conditions in the U.S. Although Chinese exports to the U.S. increased more than tenfold during our sample, the increase was not uniform across industries. For example, while air conditioning and heating equipment imports (SIC 3585) increased by a factor of more than 10, robe and dressing gown imports (SIC 2384) increased by only 70 percent, and imports in industrial gases (SIC 2813) fell by over 55 percent. use such variation to examine dierential eects of Chinese import competition across local labor markets, or commuting zones, that diered in their industrial structure. They nd that commuting zones in which a large share of initial employment 1 On the wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers, see Feenstra and Hanson (1996) and Bernard and Jensen (1997) . On the decline of U.S. manufacturing, see and Pierce and Schott (2015) . was accounted for by industries that saw large increases in Chinese imports experienced declines in employment and wages, as well as an increase in transfer payments. Importantly for the present paper, nd particularly sharp reductions in employment and labor force participation among individuals with less than a college education, suggesting that the relative returns to education shifted during this period.\nFocusing exclusively on individuals ages 25 and under, we provide further evidence of shifting employment opportunities for workers with low levels of education. We nd that increased import exposure led to reductions in employment prospects among individuals who had not completed high school, both in absolute terms and relative to individuals with higher levels of educational attainment. Per thousand dollars of import exposure, employment as a share of the population fell 1.2 percentage points for those without a high school degree relative to degree holders. Additionally, we document signicant reductions in wages among individuals with and without a high school degree during this period. These same labor markets saw large increases in graduation rates. Our results are thus consistent with a setting in which would-be dropouts weigh increased future earnings potential from further education against the opportunity cost of current labor market opportunities foregone.\nThe decision to complete high school is of considerable economic interest beyond the eld of international economics. As noted by Heckman and LaFontaine (2010) , in the United States nearly one quarter of 9\nth grade students will fail to graduate four years later. For black and Hispanic students, the number rises to one third. The economic costs of such numbers are substantial. Levin et al. (2007) estimate that each additional high school graduate among a cohort of 20-year-olds generates a lifetime net public benet ranging between $65, 000 and $150, 000.\nBecause of these large eects, the factors aecting high school graduation rates have received a great deal of attention from scholars. A wide range of potential determinants of the decision to drop out have been analyzed at the level of the student, the family, the school and the community.\n2 The primary factor of interest for the present paper is the set of labor market opportunities available to students. As early as Duncan (1965) , economists recognized that shifting labor market conditions aected the opportunity cost of continued education. In recent years, scholars have examined changes in high school completion rates in response to changes in unemployment rates, the number of individual hours worked, and minimum wage laws. 3 Consistent with our results, these authors have generally found that improvements in labor market conditions pull students out of school and into the labor market.\nOur approach has several advantages relative to the existing literature. First, unlike changes in the policy variables mentioned above, Chinese export growth is exogenous to local policy makers. This allows us to avoid endogeneity concerns that plague studies exploiting changes in state-or local-level policy variables to assess the responsiveness of the graduation rate to economic conditions. 4 Additionally, as the labor market changes examined here are triggered by long run trends in international markets, they are likely to be viewed as permanent. The decision to dropout or to remain in high school aects not only present income levels, but also the stream of all future income. In choosing to remain in school, forward-looking students weigh the cost of present income foregone against the benet of increased wages in the future. Labor market changes that are likely to persist are thus particularly relevant for educational outcomes.\nOur ndings also contribute to the literature on trade and human capital. Individual skill acquisition was famously modeled in a trade setting by Findlay and Kierzkowski (1983) and has since received attention both theoretically and empirically. 5 Recently, Gonzaga et al. (2006) and Dix-Carneiro and Kovak (2015) have provided evidence that regional trade shocks aect local skill premia. We build on these results by showing that Chinese import exposure dierentially aected employment opportunities for those with low levels of education and document human capital adjustment consistent with these changing skill premia. As the welfare consequences of trade for low-skilled workers are largely dependent upon the human capital adjustments made in response to trade shocks, our paper provides evidence of a crucial component in analyzing the labor market eects of trade.\n3 See Rees and Mocan (1997), McNeal (1997) , and Chaplin et al. (2003) , respectively.\n4 For example, one may be concerned that state-level minimum wages respond to economic conditions that might simultaneously aect graduation rates. This makes identication of a causal channel dicult.\n5 For theoretical examples, see Kreickemeier (2009 ), Falvey et al. (2010 and Davidson and Sly (2014) . Hickman and Olney (2011), and Hummels et al. (2012) Blanchard and Olney (2015) nd that increases in a country's skillintensive exports increase educational attainment, while increases in agricultural or low-skill manufacturing exports decrease educational attainment."}, {"section_title": "Empirical analysis includes", "text": "Most closely related to the present paper is recent work by Atkin (2015) , who exploits variation in the timing of manufacturing plant openings across municipalities in Mexico to examine the eect of increased job market opportunities for high school dropouts. Atkin (2015) nds that local plant openings that provide low-skill employment opportunities increase dropout rates among those eligible for employment. His results are analogous to ours, in a setting in which job opportunities for low-skilled individuals are expanding rather than contracting.\nFinally, our paper adds to a rapidly growing literature on the eects of trade on local labor markets. Beginning with Topalova (2010) economists have begun taking advantage of regionally disaggregated production data evaluate the distributional consequences of trade policies. Topalova (2010) used such data to evaluate the impact of trade liberalizaiton on poverty in India in 1991. Gonzaga et al. (2006) and Dix-Carneiro and Kovak (2015) explore the eect of trade liberalizations on skill premia in Brazil. In the United States, , Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2015) , and Acemoglu, Autor, Dorn, Hanson, and Price (2015) use the identication strategy employed in the current paper to examine a range of local labor market eects of increased import competition, while Feler and Senses (2016) examine the eects of Chinese import competition on U.S. housing prices and economic activity, and the subsequent eect on the size of local government. Finally, Hakobyan and McLaren (2016) examine U.S. labor market responses to tari reductions following NAFTA, nding substantial negative eects on wage growth in the industries and local labor markets most aected by increased Mexican imports.\nThe paper proceeds in six sections. Section 2 describes the variable construction and data used in our empirical analysis. Section 3 discusses the estimation strategy. Section 4 presents evidence of the eect of import exposure on graduation rates. Section 5 documents the labor market mechanisms that link rising import exposure to the observed rise in graduation rates.\nSection 6 contains a brief discussion and concludes."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "Our measure of import competition comes from , who examine the impact of changing exposure to imports from China on employment and income at the level of the U.S. commuting zone (henceforth c-zone).\n6 Specically, we focus on changes in import penetration per worker, as dened by Equation 1:\nThe change in U.S. imports from China in industry j (\u2206M U.S. jt (0,1) ) is scaled by the national labor force in industry j (L U.S. jt 0 ). This provides an average change in import exposure per worker in the U.S. This is weighted by the fraction of the labor force in c-zone i engaged in production in industry j, L ijt 0 L it 0 , to account for the fact that c-zones are not equally aected by 6 C-zones are geographic constructs which encompass areas with strong interior labor market ties, but weak ties across c-zones. They were used as the unit of analysis in Tolbert and Sizer (1996) and . changes in import competition in each industry. Finally, the industry-c-zone-specic value is summed over all industries j. The result is a c-zone-level measure of changes in import exposure that varies according to a c-zone's concentration in sectors competing with Chinese imports.\nThis measure is created using trade data at the six-digit HS product level taken from the Our educational outcome of interest is the educational attainment of high school students within a c-zone. Our primary measure of this is the 17 year-old graduation rate, dened as the number of diplomas awarded within the c-zone in a given year divided by the population of 17\nyear-olds in the c-zone. Annual data on diplomas awarded by U.S. public schools are provided at the school district level by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) through the Common Core of Data (CCD).\n10 The CCD also includes data on student enrollment, expenditures and the number of teachers at the school district level. This data set is widely used in the literature on U.S. high school performance, and is generally considered the best source for analyzing the performance of U.S. public schools. As with import exposure, we focus our analysis of the 17 year-old graduation rate on changes in c-zones between 1990 and 2000 and between 2000 and 2007. To obtain a czone count of diplomas for this measure, we take three year average of diplomas awarded in reporting school districts in 1989-1991, 1999-2001, and 2006-2008. 12 We then aggregate these district-level diploma totals to the c-zone level to match the import exposure measure, and divide the diploma count by the c-zone population of 17 year-olds. This leaves us with 716 c-zone graduation rate observations each in 1990, 2000, and 2007 . We experiment with alternative measures of educational attainment in Section 4.4 below.\nSummary statistics for the 17 year-old graduation rate and its changes, as well as import competition are provided in Table 1 . The changes in Chinese imports per worker to the U.S. are in thousands of 2007 USD. We see a modest increase in the average graduation rate during our sample, and a large increase in Chinese imports per worker. However, as we will discuss in the subsequent sections, these simple averages mask the substantial variation that exists across c-zones and time in both measures.\nTo assess the impact of import exposure on the returns to a high school education and the incentives of those currently enrolled in high school, we make use of data on wages and employment from IPUMS. We restrict our attention to individuals between the age of 16 and 25 in each c-zone, and consider several measures of changes in the potential labor market opportunities facing groups with diering levels of education. 13 For each c-zone we consider three subsets of the 16-25 year old population: those without a high school degree, those with a high school degree but no further schooling, and those with at least a high school degree but without a bachelor's degree. The latter two groups serve as comparison groups for individuals choosing whether to pursue further education or not. Column 1 of Table 2 displays the share of the 16-25 year old population that falls into each educational category.\n12 We drop district-years with missing data and average across the remaining district-years in each three\nyear window. This leads us to drop an average of 70 of more than 17,000 districts in each three year period.\nThe only state in which public school districts do not report in each year is Nevada, which accounts for less than 0.5% of public high school enrollment. C-zones that partially overlap with Nevada are thus also dropped.\n13 We also exclude those who are in group homes or institutionalized.\nWhile those with a high school degree or more account for 53% of our sample, those without a diploma account for 38% of this age group.\nThe rest of Table 2 documents the primary sectors of employment for each of our educational groups. The sectors included are manufacturing, agriculture, mining, and construction, retail, professional services, personal services, public administration, nance, and other non-manufacturing sectors. As our import exposure measure focuses on manufacturing imports, it is important to note that manufacturing accounted for a signicant share of employment for each educational group. For individuals without a high school diploma, the manufacturing sector accounted for 12.5% of employment. Those with only a high school degree had the highest share of manufacturing employment at 18%, while among those with at least a high school degree but no bachelors degree, manufacturing accounted for 14.8% of employment. All three educational groups were thus subject to competition from Chinese imports. Across the remaining sectors, the most stark dierence is in the share of employment accounted for by the retail sector. While approximately 30% of employment among those with at least a high school degree is accounted for by the retail sector, the number rises to 48.55% for those without a high school degree.\nWith this information in mind, we construct measures of shifting employment opportunities, as well as wages conditional on employment, among the respective educational groups. More specically, we calculate changes in the the share of each educational group that falls into the following categories: employed in manufacturing, employed in agriculture, employed in retail, employed in other non-manufacturing industries, unemployed, and not in labor force. As with changes in graduation rates, we focus on changes in between 1990\nand 2000 and between 2000 and 2007. To assess the eect of import exposure on wages, we also calculate the log change in average weekly wages for each educational group as well as for each educational group by sector of employment."}, {"section_title": "Estimation", "text": "As documented by , increased import exposure to China had considerable eects on local labor market conditions in the US. To the extent that jobs available to high school students were among those aected, import competition would also aect the opportunity cost of education. To assess the labor market and human capital eects of import competition, we turn to our main empirical specication, dened in Equation 2. We regress the change in the outcome of interest, y \u2208 (graduation rates, employment status, wages), for c-zone i on changes in import exposure per worker and additional covariates X:\nwhere the outcomes of interest are as described above. We discuss the specic controls included in X in detail below. OLS estimates of Equation 2 are subject to bias if there are demand shocks that simultaneously aect both labor market conditions and imports. To see this, imagine an exogenous increase in the demand for tennis shoes in the U.S. This would likely increase employment in regions specializing in tennis shoe production. However, rising demand is also likely to increase tennis shoe imports from China. Failing to control for the change in demand would thus lead to biased estimates of the eect of imports on domestic employment. To the extent that deteriorating labor market conditions aect educational investment, estimates of the eect of import competition on graduation rates would also be biased. In order to avoid such concerns, we follow in instrumenting for \u2206ImportExposure U.S.\nHere, the change in Chinese exports to the U.S. in industry j is replaced by the change in exports to a set of other large developed countries (\u2206M Other jt (0,1) to a discussion of the impact of import exposure on graduation rates as well as a discussion of the specic controls in X."}, {"section_title": "Human Capital Adjustments", "text": "To gain a sense of the relationship between changing trade conditions and educational outcomes, we rst estimate a univariate regression of the change in graduation rates on changes in import exposure. In this and all future regressions, standard errors are clustered at the state level to control for any state level policies related to trade adjustment assistance or other changing labor market policies which may have been changed during our sample. 15\nAdditionally, c-zone observations are weighted by their start-of-period share of the U.S. population. Column 1 of Table 3 reports results for an OLS specication using changes in import exposure in the U.S. as the explanatory variable, as in Equation 1. Consistent with the notion that students may be discouraged from leaving school by deteriorating labor market conditions, we see that increases in import exposure are correlated with an increase in the graduation rate. The point estimate of 0.013 is signicant at the 1% level, and indicates that a $1000 increase in imports per worker increases c-zone graduation rates by 1.3 percentage points.\nWhile the OLS estimate suggests a positive eect of import exposure on graduation rates, failure to account for demand-side changes in the U.S. is likely to introduce bias in this estimate. Thus, in column 2 we report results for a two-stage least squares regression of the change in graduation rate on the instrumented change in import exposure, using the instrument described in Equation 3.\nAs in the OLS specication, increases in import exposure lead to increases in graduation rates. Furthermore, the magnitude of the two-stage-least-squares estimate is nearly twice that of the OLS specication. 16 Without controlling for additional covariates, a $1,000 15 Trade growth from 1991 to 2000 and from 2000 to 2007 has been multiplied with the factors 10/9 and 10/7, respectively in order to put the two periods on a comparable decadal scale. We do this for all variables reported in changes in their respective period.\nincrease in imports per worker in a c-zone is accompanied by a 2.4 percentage point increase in the graduation rate. As indicated by our rst stage F-statistic and coecient respectively, we document a very strong positive relationship between the proposed instrument and observed import exposure per worker.\nTo put this number in context, the interquartile range of the distribution of changes in import exposure was $602 and $1093 from 1990-2000 and 2000-2007, respectively. This point estimate implies that moving from the 25 th to the 75 th percentile of the distribution of changes in import exposure would have increased a c-zone's graduation rate by 2.6 percentage points between 2000 and 2007, ceterus paribus. This is a substantial eect.\nWhile these simple specications seem to corroborate the view that increases in exposure to Chinese imports reduced the opportunity cost of education for high school students, we consider several alternative explanations for this nding. As our primary focus is on tradeinduced changes to labor market conditions leading to changes in educational attainment, we rst consider other local labor market factors that may drive this result. An initial concern is any pre-existing trend within c-zones that might aect long-term employment and educational decisions.\n17 While the rst dierence approach used in all specications removes the eect of any time invariant features within c-zones, long run c-zone specic trends are not accounted for.\nWe address this concern by including c-zone xed eects in the specication in Column 3. This implies that we are exploiting deviations from long run c-zone trends to identify the eect of import exposure on graduation rates. In addition, to eliminate the eect of any economy-wide shocks aecting both employment and educational attainment in either time period, we also include a time xed eect. Adding both xed eects to our two-stage least squares specication in column 1, we estimate a 3.5 percentage point increase in graduation rates per additional $1, 000 of import exposure per worker in a commuting zone. 18 17 For example one may have in mind cities such as Detroit, for which an economic decline pre-dated increasing import competition from China. That Detroit's population began large-scale decline in the 1950's would likely aect graduation rates in ways unrelated to import exposure.\n18 While we see a reduction in the t-statistic on import exposure from 4.57 to 2.16 we suspect this is due to the loss of 717 degrees of freedom from including our c-zone and time dummy variables."}, {"section_title": "Coincidental Labor Market Changes", "text": "The years in our sample involved a number of labor market changes unrelated to increased trade with China. For example, the period witnessed a general decline in the manufacturing sector driven in part by technological changes in production processes Acemoglu and Autor, 2011 ). An additional concern is that employment opportunities for potential dropouts may be changing due to these broader shifts in the economy, rather than increased import exposure. If such changes were greatest in c-zones in which import exposure increased the most, failure to account for them would result in biased estimates.\nAs an attempt to eliminate the eect of such broader trends, in Table 4 we include controls for a range of start-of-period dierences across c-zones that may have led to dierent labor market experiences, independent of trade."}, {"section_title": "19", "text": "In column 1 of Table 4 , we include the start-of-period c-zone log population. One might suspect, for instance, that changing technology aected returns to agglomeration throughout our sample. We include the share of the employed population ages 16-25 working in the manufacturing sector in a c-zone to control for the general manufacturing decline described above. The two variables enter insignicantly, and leave the point estimate on changes in import exposure largely unaected in magnitude and signicant at the 5% level.\nTo the extent that the technological changes during our sample were skill-biased, one would expect dierent outcomes for c-zones with high initial levels of education compared to those with lower initial levels. Thus, in column 2 we account for the start-of-period share of the c-zone population 35 and older that has earned no more than a high school degree. We focus on the population 35 years old and older as these individuals will largely have made decisions regarding educational levels prior to our sample period. As expected, c-zones with larger initial population shares with no more than a high school degree experience reductions in graduation rates relative to c-zones with a more educated population. Inclusion of this variable increases the point estimate on the eect of import exposure slightly. A $1, 000 increase in imports per worker increases graduation rates by 4% percentage points.\nTo this we add a control for the share of the c-zone population that is foreign-born in column 3. This control has little impact on our main coecient but enters positively suggest-19 That is, for the 1990-2000 change, we control for c-zone characteristics in levels in 1990.\ning that c-zones with greater initial shares of foreign-born workers were likely to experience increases in graduation rates. Finally, in column 4 we account for the initial shares of c-zone populations who identify as Hispanic, black, American-Indian, a separate minority category, and male. Including these variables reduces our estimate of import exposure slightly, but leaves it statistically and economically signicant. We nd that a $1,000 increase in import exposure per worker leads to a 3.7 percentage point increase in the graduation rate."}, {"section_title": "School Quality and Community Determinants of Graduation", "text": "Having addressed concerns regarding alternative labor market explanations for the rise in graduation rates, we now consider a range of other individual-and local-level factors recognized in the literature to aect educational outcomes.\n20 Insofar as import exposure may be related to these various factors, such as school expenditures, omitting them from our regressions will result in biased estimates. For all specications in this section, we include and suppress the variables indicated in column 4 of Table 4 .\nWe begin by controlling for changes in state-level policy that might have altered graduation rates. Compulsory attendance policies have been shown to increase retention at the individual level by Angrist and Krueger (1991) , among others. These policies typically increase the age at which students are legally able to drop out, thereby reducing the ability of students to respond to changes in local labor market conditions. If areas that experienced increases in import competition were also those that increased the compulsory attendance age, the results identied above are biased. During our sample period, 245 c-zones increased the minimum age to drop out of high school.\nTo control for such changes, in column 1 of Table 5 we include a variable that indicates the proportion of a c-zone's population that experienced an increase in compulsory attendance. 21 Consistent with prior literature, compulsory attendance increases graduation rates. However, the import exposure variable remains signicant at the 5% level. A $1,000 increase in import exposure is associated with an increase in the graduation rate in a c-zone of 3.9 percentage points.\n20 For examples of this literature, see, e.g., Card and Krueger (1992) ; Angrist and Lavy (1999); Ehrenberg and Brewer (1994) .\nIn columns 2 and 3 we introduce controls for teen birth rates and the share of the c-zone population that identies as having been divorced.\n22 Both teen pregnancy and parental divorce have been shown to reduce the probability that students graduate from high school,\nand were plausibly altered in response to changing economic conditions resulting from shifts in import competition. 23 While increases in teen birth rates lead to declines in graduation rates, divorces are insignicantly related to graduation rates. Neither variable's inclusion substantively aects our estimate of the impact of increases in import competition on graduation rates.\nFinally, in columns 4 and 5 we control for changes in school quality. One might be concerned that trade-induced changes in the local economy aected school funding or stang levels, thereby altering the graduation rate through omitted quality channels. To address this concern, in column 4 we control for changes in the c-zone teacher to student ratio, and in column 5 we include the c-zone level expenditure per student (in tens of thousands of dollars).\n24 The two variables enter positively and signicantly, and increase our point estimate slightly, while leaving the qualitative story unchanged."}, {"section_title": "Mobility", "text": "A nal threat to our identication strategy is the potential for migration of low-skilled workers from high import exposure to low import exposure commuting zones. While Autor et al.\n(2013) do not nd evidence of net migration as a function of import exposure, we additionally consider selective migration. Specically, it is well known that parental education levels are a strong predictor of children's educational attainment.\n25 One may thus be concerned that the migration of adults with low educational levels would simultaneously move students most at would be rising graduation rates where import exposure increased the most, mimicking an increasing graduation rate caused by the labor market channel we hypothesize.\nTo address this concern, we directly account for changes in the demographic and educational composition of the labor force within c-zones. We return to the specication described in column 3 of Table 5 , which includes c-zone employment and demographic controls in startof-period levels, as well as changes in c-zone divorce rates, teen birthrates, and compulsory schooling laws. To this, we add changes in demographic patterns that are likely to be correlated with changes in educational outcomes. We rst control for simple net migration by including changes in c-zone log population in column 1 of Table 6 . Net migration has a positive and marginally signicant eect on graduation rates, but does not meaningfully alter our results.\nIn addition to controlling for changes in total population size, in column 2 we include changes in the share of the population age 35 or older with no more than 12 years of schooling.\nThis is intended to capture the movement of individuals and families with low education levels away from the c-zones most strongly aected by import competition, as described above.\nThe eect is not statistically signicant, and inclusion of this variable does not alter the point estimate of interest.\nIt is of course possible that there is selective migration in response to import competition by groups with diering propensities to graduate that is not captured by the simple measure included in column 2. In columns 3 and 4, we thus control for changes in a wide range of demographic factors that are potentially correlated with changes in graduation rates. In column 3 we include controls for the change in the share of the population that is foreignborn and the change in the share of the population that identies as Hispanic. 26 That such changes might matter is suggested by the work of Cadena and Kovak (2013) , for instance, who nd that low skilled Mexican workers are highly geographically responsive to changes in local labor market conditions. This is important for the present paper, as Heckman and LaFontaine (2010) nd that Hispanic students are the demographic with the lowest graduation rates. Inclusion of these measures does little to alter our estimates. As shown in 26 As noted above, while suppressed for space, we also include these measures in start-of-period levels.\ncolumn 3, we nd that a $1000 per worker increase in import exposure per worker leads to a 3.7 percentage point increase in the graduation rate.\nTo further control for changes in graduation rates caused by dierential mobility across demographic groups, in column 4 we account for changes in the share of the c-zone population that identies as black, American-Indian, a dierent minority group, and male. The point estimate on import exposure decreases slightly, to 3.43 percent per $1000 increase in imports per worker, but remains signicant at the 5% level."}, {"section_title": "Alternative Graduation Measures", "text": "To this point we have dened c-zone graduation rates as the number of diplomas awarded within a c-zone divided by the number of 17 year-olds in the c-zone. Our goal is to measure the educational attainment of individuals within the c-zone, while controlling for the size of the student base within the c-zone -the number of individuals who might potentially earn a diploma within a given year. While we believe that the 17 year-old graduation rate captures precisely this, we experiment with a range of other potential measures of graduation rates.\nIn Table 7 , we repeat the specication from column 4 of Table 6 , in which we control for coincident labor market changes, changes to school quality and local policy, and changing migration patterns. These controls are suppressed to save space.\n27 We experiment with four alternative measures of high school completion. First, we allow the age range in the denominator of the graduation rate to vary. Specically, we divide the number of diplomas awarded in a c-zone by the total number of 16-18 year-olds in the commuting zone, divided by three. This serves to emphasize the fact that our results are not dependent upon the choice of a base age of 17. As can be seen in column 1, this is the case. The point estimate is reduced slightly relative to Table 6 , but is still statistically signicant at the 5% level and is economically meaningful. A $1,000 increase in imports per worker increases c-zone graduation rates by 3.2 percentage points.\nSecond, we consider the number of diplomas awarded in a given year divided by the number of eighth graders in the c-zone four years earlier.\n28 That is, we divide the number 27 Unabridged tables are available in an online appendix.\n28 Data on annual eighth grade enrollment at the school district level is provided by the CCD. of diplomas awarded by the number of students we would expect to graduate if all students entering high school four years prior had graduated on time. This is the on-time graduation rate widely used in the literature on high school performance. We prefer the measure used throughout the paper for several reasons. First, we ultimately are concerned with nal educational attainment, whether it occurs on time or not. By ignoring delayed graduation, we potentially misstate the eect of trade on educational outcomes. Second, the majority of research on the on-time graduation using the CCD data is focused on changes at the state or national level. Missing data on enrollment by grade level at the school district level create diculties in calculating an on time graduation rate at the local level.\n29 Nevertheless, due to its wide use in the literature on graduation rates, we include this measure here as a robustness exercise. As can be seen in column 2, our results employing the on-time graduation rate provide a larger point estimate but are broadly similar to those reported throughout the paper.\nIn column 3, we consider log changes in diplomas awarded within c-zones, rather than changes in graduation rates. This alleviates concerns that changes in graduation rates may be driven by changes in the student base, rather than actual changes in educational outcomes. In addition to the covariates included in columns 1 and 2, we control for the log changes in the population of 17 year-olds, so that we are considering changes in high school graduation conditional on changes in the number of students who can potentially graduate.\nThe point estimate is positive and statistically signicant. There is an absolute increase in the number of diplomas awarded in response to rising import exposure, conditional on any population shifts. We are thus condent that the results above are driven largely by changes in educational outcomes, rather than changes in the student population.\nFinally, in column 4 we employ an entirely distinct measure of educational attainment.\nRather than examining changes in diplomas awarded within a particular c-zone, we examine changes in the share of the c-zone population between ages 18 and 25 with at least 12 years of education, as reported in the IPUMS Census data. Throughout the paper, we have preferred to use annual data on diplomas awarded, as reported by the CCD for several reasons. First, 29 In approximately 10 percent of the c-zone-year observations, we calculate an on-time graduation rate greater than one. In private correspondence, the NCES acknowledged this as an inherent diculty in using the enrollment data at this level of disaggregation.\nas noted by Heckman and LaFontaine (2010) , the Census data on high school completion does not distinguish between individuals earning a diploma and those who complete a GED. Given the extremely low returns to a GED estimated by , this is a serious shortcoming. Second, any measure that considers the share of the population with a diploma will be particularly susceptible to problems related to migration, given the mobility of individuals following high school completion. However, this alternative measure does allow us to capture changes in educational attainment at non-public as well as public high schools.\nFurthermore, it relies entirely on Census data, rather than the CCD data, and thus serves as a robustness check on the CCD data itself. Thus, while we prefer measures based upon the CCD data, we include the measure based upon Census data here as a robustness check.\nAs can be seen from column 4, our results obtain even when considering this substantially dierent measure of educational attainment. A $1,000 increase in imports per worker leads to complete high school for such students. Thus, it is not surprising that the magnitude of the eect is reduced in this specication. Nonetheless, that we still nd an eect using such a distinct measure, and using a separate data source, gives us condence that we are in fact identifying a shift in educational outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Labor Market Outcomes by Education Levels", "text": "Thus far we have focused on the human capital response among young individuals to increased import competition. As general labor market conditions declined in the c-zones most aected by import competition, there is reason to suspect that young individuals increased educational attainment in response to declining labor market prospects. However, as more direct evidence of this labor market channel, we now turn our attention to changing labor market conditions for those between age 16 and 25 in response to import competition."}, {"section_title": "5.1", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Changes in Labor Market Status", "text": "We begin by examining the impact of import exposure on the employment prospects of 16 to 25 year olds with dierent levels of education in Table 8 . As Chinese exports are largely concentrated in low skill manufacturing products, one might anticipate changes in employment outcomes favoring individuals with higher levels of education relative to those with lower levels of education. With this in mind, we consider the eect of changes in import exposure on employment among three groups: those without a high school degree, those with a high school degree but no further education, and those with at least a high school degree but without a bachelor's degree. Specically, we consider changes in the share of each of the three educational group reporting the following employment status: employed in manufacturing, employed in agriculture, employed in retail, employed in other non-manufacturing sectors, unemployed, and not in the labor force.\n30 We focus on these three sectors as they account for over 70% of all employment for those without a high school degree. Our results are largely unchanged by including further divisions of sectors, such as in Table 2 . Panels A, B, and C provide estimates for those without a high school degree, those only with a high school degree, and those with a high school degree or more, respectively. All specications in this section include the covariates introduced in Table 7 , which are suppressed to save space.\nThis ensures we are exploiting the same variation to identify the labor market eects that we deemed relevant for clean identication of the educational response to import exposure.\nTurning rst to Panel A of Table 8 , we nd declines in the share of the population employed in each sector among those without a high school degree. All eects are signicant at the 1% level. The share of the population employed in the manufacturing sector fell by 0.854 percentage points per thousand dollars of import exposure. In addition to the reductions in manufacturing employment, this group also experienced substantial reductions in the share of the population employed in agriculture, construction and mining, as well as other non-manufacturing sectors. The largest reductions in employment for those without a high school degree, however, was a 1.9 percentage point reduction in employment in the retail sector per thousand dollars of import exposure.\nSumming across all industries, a $1000 increase in imports per worker led to a reduction 30 This is similar to Table 5 in . We thank an anonymous referee for the suggestion.\nin employment of 4.3 percentage points for those without a high school degree. If high school students are myopic, as suggested by Oreopoulos (2007) , then this loss of immediate employment opportunities alone may be enough to increase graduation rates. If, however, students are forward looking, then it is the relative change in employment opportunities compared to their more educated peers that may drive human capital decisions. With this in mind, in Panel B and Panel C we examine the employment eects of import competition on more educated groups. In the rst column we see that a $1000 increase in imports per worker reduced the share of employment in the manufacturing for those with only a high school diploma and for those with at least a high school diploma but no bachelor's degree by 2.8 and 2.4 percentage points, respectively. That is, Chinese import competition had an even larger eect on the manufacturing employment opportunities for those with a high school degree than those without. Looking to the second column, which accounts for agriculture, mining, and construction, we see similar losses to those without a high school diploma a roughly 0.8 percentage point reduction in the share of the population employed.\nThe retail sector, however, paints a dierent picture. While those without a high school degree saw a 1.9 percentage point reduction in employment, those with more eduction actually saw slight increases in employment in this sector. Whether students continued schooling beyond high school, or not, import exposure was associated with an increase in the share of the respective population employed in retail between 0.7 and 0.8 percent per $1000 increase in imports per worker. Using the shares of the population accounted for by each educational group in Table 2 (38% without a degree as compared to 54% with high school or more), back of the envelope calculations suggest that those with a high school degree or more took over over half (52%) of the jobs lost by those without a high school degree in the retail sector.\nIn addition to potential aggregate reductions in labor demand due to import exposure, it seems that in the retail sector there was a substitution away from those without a diploma in favor of those who were more educated.\nSumming the rst four columns within each panel in Table 8 yields the net eect of Chinese import exposure on employment within each educational group. On net, we see that the share of the population that was employed fell by 4.3 percentage points, 3.07 and 2.56 percentage points per thousand dollars of import exposure for those without a high school diploma, those with only a high school diploma and those with a diploma or more, respectively. Thus, employment opportunities deteriorated for high school dropouts not only in an absolute sense, but also relative to their more educated peers."}, {"section_title": "31", "text": "In the nal two columns of Table 8 , we see that the reduction in employment for those without a high school degree is split between a 1.6 percentage point increase in unemployment and a 2.7 percentage point decrease in the labor force participation rate, both signicant at the 1% level. This decline in labor force participation is what one would expect if individuals experiencing declines in labor market opportunities opted to obtain additional education. In this light, it is worth noting that among the groups with a high school degree, the eect of import competition on labor force participation is substantially smaller."}, {"section_title": "Changes in Wages", "text": "We now turn to the eect of import competition on wages for the various educational groups.\nIn Table 9 we regress the log change of c-zone average weekly wages on changes in import exposure. As in Table 8 , all additional controls are omitted for the sake of space. As is clear from the table, all three educational groups experienced substantial reductions in wages.\nHowever, unlike the eect on employment, the eect on wages is not disproportionately concentrated among those without a high school degree. All three groups experienced reductions in weekly wages ranging between between 5.2% and 5.9% per $1000 increase in imports per worker. These results should be interpreted with caution, however. If, in the face of import competition, employers were more likely to keep their most productive workers, the selection eect would bias the eect on wages upwards. The consequence is that we may understate the impact of import exposure on wages, and the extent to which the eect is understated would depend on the extent to which educational groups experienced selective reductions in employment. Given the employment eects observed in the previous table, we know that dierent educational groups experienced signicantly dierent changes in employment conditions. It is thus dicult to interpret the magnitude of the eect of import competition on wages directly. 31 While omitted for the sake of space, separate regressions show that these dierences are statistically signicant.\nFinally, in Table 10 we examine changes in average weekly wages by educational group in each of the previously discussed sectors. Panel A reports results by sector for individuals without a high school degree, Panel B for those with only a high school degree, and Panel C those with a high school degree but not a bachelor's degree. Beginning with the manufacturing sector, in Column 1, we nd an insignicant eect of import exposure on average weekly wages. That is, in the manufacturing sector, losses were driven by reductions in employment rather than reductions in wages among those maintaining employment. This is consistent with the results found by . In the agriculture, mining, and construction sectors, as well as in the retail sector, all educational groups saw reductions in wages. Those with a diploma or more saw 4.1% and 4.7% reductions in weekly wages in agriculture, mining and construction and in retail, respectively. For those without a diploma, reductions in wages were substantially larger in both industries. Average weekly wages fell by 7.5% and 8.7% in agriculture, mining and construction and in retail, respectively, for those without a high school degree. Again, the retail sector is the primary sector of employment for those without a high school degree. Such declines in relative wages are thus potentially quite relevant to the choice to pursue further education or not.\nIn sum, then, we do nd evidence of a reduction in relative labor market returns for the least educated individuals in response to rising import competition. There was a reduction in employment levels both in absolute terms and relative to more educated groups, while all groups experienced similar declines in wages in aggregate. In the sector accounting for nearly half of employment of those without a high school degree, retail, wages and employment fell both in absolute terms and relative to more educated individuals. We also nd particularly strong eects on labor force participation for the least educated group, consistent with our ndings on increased graduation rates. Would-be dropouts responded to reduced labor market opportunities by leaving the labor force entirely, with at least some pursuing further education.\nInterestingly, the eect on the least educated individuals was, to some extent, an indirect one. As noted, by far the largest employer of young individuals without a high school degree is the retail sector, and it is in this sector that individuals with low levels of educational attainment experienced the greatest reduction in employment and wages. As noted in Table 8 , the share of employment accounted for by the retail sector actually rose slightly for more educated groups in response to import competition. There is evidence, then, of a crowding out eect, as individuals with a high school education were driven from the manufacturing sector in the face of increased import competition and replaced less educated individuals in the retail sector. Our results are also consistent with the ndings of Hakobyan and McLaren (2016) , who nd a substantial regional eect of increased import competition following NAFTA independent of the industry-specic eects. That is, while it was the manufacturing sector that was directly aected by increased import competition, this led to a broader economic decline in the regions most aected, reducing employment and wages in non-manufacturing sectors as well."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In this paper we provide evidence that the rise of Chinese import competition in the U.S.\nfrom 1990-2007 led to a decline in labor market opportunities for individuals without a high school degree, resulting in increased high school graduation rates in the most aected labor markets. Increasing import exposure led to reductions in wages for all levels of education, and a reduction in employment for those without a high school degree relative to the more educated. The share of the population without a high school diploma that was employed fell by 4.3 percentage points per $1000 increase in imports per worker, with more than half of this eect accounted for by reductions in labor force participation.\nInterestingly, in addition to the direct eect of import competition on the manufacturing sector, there is evidence of crowding out of less educated individuals in the retail sector.\nAs import competition rose, the share of the low skilled population employed in retail fell sharply, while the share of the population with at least a high school degree employed in the retail sector rose slightly. This suggests that as individuals with a high school degree were driven from the manufacturing sector, retail employers may have replaced lower skilled labor with higher skilled workers.\nWe nd that these labor market declines had substantial eects on human capital accumulation among young individuals. For each $1000 of additional import exposure we see an increase in the graduation rate of roughly 3.43 percentage points. Given the fact that the interquartile dierence in import exposure between 2000 and 2007 was $1061, movement from the 25 th to the 75 th in the distribution of changes in import exposure increased c-zone graduation rates by approximately 3.64 percentage points. Our ndings are the rst to link international trade in the U.S. to high school graduation rates, and provide evidence of an important channel through which trade might aect long run welfare.
