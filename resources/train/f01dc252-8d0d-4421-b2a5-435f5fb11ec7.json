[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The nursery and greenhouse industry generates a significant economic impact on the United States economy. Recent estimates showed that the annual economic contribution of the industry amounted to $31.25 billion (Hodges et al., 2015). The industry also created 240,809 jobs, generated $13.71 billion labor income, and paid $713 million in business taxes. Recent U.S. data on industry employment and wages indicate that greenhouses and nurseries paid total annual wages amounting to $5.27 billion to 154,917 workers in 2018 (BLS, 2019). The usefulness of computers in a greenhouse environment had been expressed by Ting (1992) who described computers as 'effective in rapidly processing information, generate status reports, provide decision support, gather sensor signals, and instruct machines to perform physical tasks.' Recently, Trafton (2019) reported that researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Open Agriculture Initiative are demonstrating that the future of agriculture is computerized. Initial results of this initiative showed that \"they have created basil plants that are likely more delicious than any you have ever tasted (Johnson et al., 2019).\" The use of computers had significant application to horticulture marketing. Peterson et al. (2018) conducted \"a survey to gauge the extent of the use of new-media marketing by ornamental horticulture businesses across the U.S. The results of the survey showed that a majority of the sample (89%) were involved in new-media marketing, and all new-media users made use of at least one new-media tool. Facebook was used by more than 90% of new media users, followed by the business' website, which was used by 82% of respondents.\" Using the 2014 National Green Industry Survey, Torres et al. (2019) managerial decisions involving the use of online advertising, how much to invest in these methods and determine the factors influencing these decisions such as market outlets, product types, firm characteristics, and owner's perceptions. The use of computers had serious implications for the labor market. Plant et al. (2019) assessed the impact of computerization on the U.S. labor market during the past seven decades starting from the use of mainframe computers (1950-1980), personal computers (1980-1994), network era (1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007), mobile period (2007-2014), and the internet of things (2014present). Krahe and Campbell (2016) examined the impacts of technology use on full-time and part-time workers in the green industry. The 2017 Farm Computer Usage and Ownership report showed that 71 percent of U.S. farms had Internet access, but only 47 percent of the operations used computers for farm business (USDA, 2019a). The number of farm businesses which had access to computers rose from 38 percent in 1977 to 64 percent in 2007, and 73 percent in 2017 (Fig. 1). Less than half of the agricultural operations used computers for the farm business (20% in 1997, 35% in 2007, and 47% in 2017). The number of farm businesses which had access to the internet rose significantly during the 20-year-period (13% in 1997, 55% in 2007, and 71% in 2017). Source: USDA (2019a)."}, {"section_title": "Figure 1. Computer Use in U.S. Agriculture", "text": "Several investigators evaluated the influence of firm and manager's characteristics on the adoption and successful use of computers in agriculture. Baker (1992) found out that computer adoption among New Mexico agribusinesses was significantly enhanced by firm characteristics such as size and type of business. He concluded, however, that the manager's characteristics, including age and education, did not have any significant effect on computer use. Further, the success of the computer system was highly influenced by the personal involvement of the agribusiness manager (Baker, 2006). Among Ohio commercial farmers, Batte et al. (1990) reported that older farmers were less likely to adopt computers. The older farmers considered in as less useful and made fewer computer applications in their business. A positive association between the level of education and computer adoption and a higher number of computer applications was observed among commercial Ohio farmers. Among German male workers, an analysis of the German Socio-Economic Panel individual data showed that a strong and negative relationship between the age of workers and computer use was observed (Schleife, 2006). The impacts of higher levels of education and better employment status on the use of computers were significantly enhanced. In a later report, it was observed that Ohio farmers continued to expand the use of computers (Batte, 2003). The primary use for computers by the Ohio farmers were financial accounting and the use of the internet for information collection. Among the Great Plains farmers, however, the use of the internet for farm-related businesses resulted in no economic benefits (Smith et al., 2004). In a 2003 national survey of the U.S. nursery and greenhouse industry, Campbell et al. (2009) reported that computer usage considerably increased due to every-day tasks involving computer applications. In the same national survey, the Mountain region recorded the highest level of computer adoption for production, marketing, and management . A lower percent of computer use (25%) was estimated at the 2008 National Green Industry Survey as compared to the percent use (27.5%) observed in the 2003 survey. The Mountain region maintained a higher percent of computer use in the 2008 survey.  Hodges et al. (2010). Posadas et al. (2018) summarized the initial results of the computer usage of the 215 growers which participated in the socioeconomics of nursery automation survey conducted in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Computer usage was measured as a binary variable. The answers to the questions of whether the listed nursery functions are computerized or not are either 1 or 0. All growers surveyed were asked a series of questions to determine what nursery and greenhouse tasks were performed using computers (Table 1). The survey results indicated that \"there are extensive and marked differences in computer use in nursery and greenhouse operations throughout the surveyed U.S. Southern States. The most frequently performed computer tasks in the three surveys described above were word processing, communications, internet commerce, and accounting and cost analysis. The less frequently accomplished computer tasks were inventory management, financial investment and analysis, production scheduling, and greenhouse production controls. The most infrequently done computer tasks by nursery and greenhouse operations were digital imaging for disease diagnosis, use of CDs for marketing, barcoding, and grading. Posadas et al. (2018) asserted that \"the increased availability and ease of use of computing devices such as tablets and smartphones should contribute to a marked increase in computer usage within the nursery and greenhouse industry. As computers become more widely used in the industry to aid in required tasks, firms can better allocate assets (i.e., labor) to help the firms operate more efficiently, in turn, increasing profits and morale.\" Posadas et al. (2018) concluded that \"the statistical results showed stability in the use of computers for word processing by the participating nurseries and greenhouses. However, there remained a sizeable proportion of horticulture growers who did not use computers during the period under study.\" They suggested that \"further econometric analysis be conducted to identify the significant factors enhancing or limiting the use of computers in horticultural operations. These factors will include, among others, the operational characteristics of the participating establishments and socioeconomic characteristics of its owners and operators.\" This paper attempts to identify the significant determinants of computer usage among nursery and greenhouse operations. Specifically, it identifies and measures the influence of owner/operator characteristics, firm operational characteristics, firm location, and the great recession on computer usage among participating nursery and greenhouse operations."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": "A regional socioeconomic survey of randomly selected wholesale nursery and greenhouse operations was conducted in eight selected Southern states as a part of a research program undertaken by the Mississippi Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station (MAFES) and the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) entitled 'Enhancing labor performance of the green industry in the gulf south.' The survey consisted of eight parts, namely workers' demographic characteristics, nursery characteristics, nursery mechanization, greenhouse mechanization, labor and capital markets, pesticide and chemicals, working conditions, and respondents' characteristics (Posadas, 2018a;2018b;Posadas et al., 2008;2010a;2012;2014). The overall goals of the regional socioeconomic survey were to develop a socioeconomic profile of horticulture workers and to evaluate the impact of automation on their employment, earnings, safety, skill levels, and retention rates. The scope of this work, however, was limited to the determinants of the decisions involved in the use of computers in the horticulture industry. Earlier publications using the databases mentioned above collected from Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama covered the socioeconomic characteristics of workers and working conditions [Posadas et al., 2010a), nursery and greenhouse operational characteristics (Posadas et al., 2010b), and socioeconomic impacts of mechanization and automation (Posadas et al., 2008;2012). Addition al publications covering all the participating nurseries and greenhouses in eight Southern states included current mechanization systems (Coker et al., 2010;, socioeconomic impacts of mechanization and automation (Posadas et al., 2008;2012), and hiring preferences (Posadas et al., 2014). Recently, the determinants of mechanization (Posadas, 2018a) and socioeconomic characteristics of owners and operators were explored (Posadas, 2018b). A national survey of nurseries and greenhouses is conducted every five years by a multistate research committee named Sustainable Practices, Economic Contributions, Consumer Behavior, and Labor Management in the U.S. Environmental Horticulture Industry (NIMSS, 2019). The National Green Industry Surveys conducted by the multi-state research committee in 2003 and 2008 included questions on computer usage by horticulture businesses which participated in the surveys. From the data collected by the fourth and fifth national nursery surveys conducted by the multi-state research committee, there were 2,485 valid responses in 2003 and 3,043 valid responses in 2008. No questions on computer use were asked in the succeeding national green industry surveys. Hall et al. (2006) reported that the primary research data on the structure of the nursery industry was generated by the Fourth Nursery Industry Survey conducted by the multi-state regional research committee in early 2004. The multi-state regional research committee conducted the Fifth National Nursery Survey in all 50 states in 2009 (Hodges et al., 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Primary Data Collection", "text": "Face-to-face interviews with wholesale nurseries and greenhouses were conducted in eight Southern States -Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Florida, Tennessee, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia from Dec. 2003to Nov. 2009 (Posadas, 2018a;2018b). This length of time was required due to the distance traveled to complete the interviews, the availability of the growers, and the major hurricanes in 2005 and 2008. Official lists of certified nurseries were retrieved from state departments of agriculture or state nursery associations. Only wholesale growers were included in the selection of survey participants. The wholesale growers in each state included in the survey were identified and numbered from 1 to N (Posadas, 2018a;2018b). Using Excel (Office 2003; Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA), 50 random integers were individually generated from 1 to N, where N = the number of wholesale growers in each state. Individual letters of introduction were sent to the 50 selected nurseries and greenhouses in each state in advance. Follow-up telephone calls were made to each of the nursery or greenhouse which were chosen to determine their willingness to participate and availability for the interviews. The survey respondents were the owners or operators of the selected nurseries or greenhouses (Posadas, 2018a;2018b). These growers were contacted via mail and were asked to return a prepaid postcard indicating their willingness to participate in the survey. The nurseries or greenhouses showing a willingness to engage were then reached by phone, and interviews scheduled. A total of 215 personal interviews were completed with wholesale nurseries (N = 88), greenhouses (N = 52) and mixed nursery or greenhouse operations (N= 75) in Mississippi (32), Louisiana (29), Alabama (26), Florida (27), Tennessee (17), South Carolina (30), North Carolina (30), and Georgia (24). The socioeconomic data consisted of variables dealing with labor, technical, and economic information about the nurseries and greenhouses in the eight Southern states (Posadas, 2018a;2018b;Posadas et al., 2008;2012;2014). The owners or operators' characteristics included, among others age, formal education completed, horticulture business experience, and perceptions of the availability of labor and capital. The operational characteristics including but not limited to the quantity and quality of workers, growing area, annual gross sales, level of mechanization, the computer uses, and year established. The horticulture firm's economic and operational characteristics collected by the 2003 and 2008 National Green Industry Surveys included among many others computer use, firm size in acres, and annual gross sales, number of workers, regional location. Additional economic characteristics included year established and wholesale or retail trade. All the 2003 national survey respondents were recruited to join the survey through the mail survey. About 10 percent of the 2008 National Green Industry Survey participants responded through an online survey. It was expected that the online survey participants have higher levels of computerization in their operations than those who did the mail survey."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Models", "text": "The empirical model used in identifying and measuring the impacts of the significant determinants of computer usage among nurseries and greenhouses in the eight Southern states is as follows (Eq. 1): where computer use = number of computer uses by participating nurseries and greenhouses, HC = characteristics of human capital, LC = perceptions of availability labor and capital, QS = quantity and skills of the workers, OC = operational characteristics, LR = location and recession, E = error term, and \u00dfi = regression coefficients.

In 2008, a total of 3,043 valid responses were compiled from the participating horticultural farms from a national survey in 50 states. The empirical results of the models showed that the socioeconomic characteristics of owners and operators from the eight Southern States have limited influence on the computerization of horticulture operations. It seemed that older owners and operators were less inclined to use computers in their horticultural operations. The level of formal education, horticultural experience, and satisfaction of current lifestyle did not have any significant effects on computerization. The perceptions of the availability of labor to the industry encouraged more use of computers in operations. The perceptions of the availability of capital for the industry did not have any significant effects on computerization. In the 2003 and 2008 national green industry surveys, however, no data on the socioeconomic characteristics of owners and operators were collected. The number and quality of workers played a significant influence on computerization from both the eight Southern States and the national green industry surveys. The more workers employed by the firms, the higher is the level of computerization reported by these firms. However, horticulture firms with more new workers with horticulture skills and more migrant workers tend to have a lesser level of computerization of their operations. The type of horticulture operations exercised mixed influences on the computerization of horticulture operations. Among the nurseries and greenhouses from the eight Southern United States, there were no significant differences in the level of computerization among the nurseries-only, greenhouse-only and mixed greenhouse-nursery operations. Among the horticulture operations with a higher percentage of sales sold wholesale from the 2003 and 2008 national green industry surveys, however, exhibited a slightly higher but insignificant level of computerization. The level of automation of workers' tasks from horticulture firms in the eight Southern States encouraged the level of computerization of operations. The size of the land area under production in both the regional and national surveys, however, tend to have no significant effects on the level of computerization of operations. The number of years since the establishment and the form of business organization among the horticulture firms in the eight Southern States did not have any significant influence over the level of computerization. Among the horticulture firms from the 2003 and 2008 national green industry surveys, however, those who have been in business longer tend to have a lesser level of computerization. The annual gross sales of horticulture firms have significantly influenced the level of computerization among the nurseries and greenhouses from the 2003 and 2008 national green industry surveys. Firms with higher annual gross sales enhanced the level of computerization of their operations. There was no significant influence on computerization among the horticulture firms in the 2003-09 regional survey in eight Southern States. Finally, the state or regional location of the participating horticultural operations have significant impacts of computerization. The firms located in the Mountain and Pacific regions reported higher level of computerization of their operations. The Great Recession in Dec. 2007 to June 2009 tend to have encouraged the participating firms to improve the computerization of their horticultural operations."}]
