Traveling the coast from Brownsville, Texas to the shores of New England, seasonal tropical storm and hurricane systems create many unique and challenging circumstances which residents choose to endure. Historically, these seaside communities had very little warning time to prepare for an impending storm, and most residents simply hunkered down and waited for the storm to pass (Barnes, 2007). Once the storm had passed, then began the sometimes all too familiar tasks of recovery and rebuilding. While these storms have been long understood to be life threatening, population growth along vulnerable coastlines has continued unabated (Crowell et al., 2010;National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, 2004;Van Vuren et al., 2004). Considering the growing number of permanent and seasonal residents, coastal population vulnerabilities continue to rise as well. Coastal populations experience greater risk from tropical cyclones due to their proximity to open waters of the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. A number of existing studies indicate that those residents who live closer to the shore incur greater diversity as well as intensity of tropical cyclones (Bellomo and Crowell, 2010;Cutter et al., 2003;Islam et al., 2010;NOAA, 2004, Ozyurt andErgin, 2010;Rowley et al., 2007). Likewise, local vulnerabilities to tropical cyclones are also greater closer to the shore. For example, residents who live in a house adjacent to the beach are more likely to experience greater amounts and frequency of flooding from storm surge than those residents who live further inland (Southwest Florida Regional Planning Council, SWFRPC, 2010). Regardless of scientific evidence suggesting an increased danger to reside near the coast, real estate values and residential demand for coastal living has ceased to decline. Though technology has provided the ability to lessen the potential for lives lost to damaging storms, for example by constructing more wind resistant buildings, many of the same historical problems remain a challenge to ensure the safety of all residents in the event of a storm. Pre-existing socioeconomic circumstances result in an inability or at least limited ability for some permanent residential populations to seek adequate evacuation transportation and shelter during and/or after a storm event. Parallel to coastal population growth is the increasing number of residents who are socially vulnerable to near shore hazards. Social vulnerabilities are currently best described as individual characteristics which are products of pre-existing social inequalities that present harm to a group and govern the ability to respond to a natural disaster, such as: age, race, income, health, employment, and type of dwelling unit (Cutter et al., 2003). For example, populations with an income level below the national poverty line may experience greater difficulty accessing timely transportation to adequate shelter before and/or after a storm event. Further explanation provides that socially created vulnerabilities to natural hazards are \"largely ignored, mainly due to the difficulty in quantifying them\" (Cutter et al, 2003). The relatively little amount of existing research and difficulty to quantify socially created vulnerabilities might explain why social aspects of loss are not included in many after-disaster loss estimation reports (Cutter et al., 2003). Local focus on socially vulnerable circumstances remains limited when planning for and responding to a storm event. Great consideration and resources are appropriated to estimate risk and mitigate the loss of financial assets from hurricanes (Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, 2001). The copious attention to protect financial asset is understandable considering the nature of these resources is easily defined by their assessment in quantifiable value (Cutter, et al., 2003). While socially vulnerable population research and planning is outnumbered by focus towards quantifiable economic loss, this does not diminish the real impact felt by those residents who are less able to prepare for and recover from a tropical cyclone and further enforces the need for additional research on the topic. The need to better understand social vulnerability is evident considering the somewhat small amount of existing research and planning for these sensitivities. Current research largely measures social vulnerability at the national scale using county jurisdictional boundaries as enumeration units for comparison. There currently appears to be very little research (Cutter, et al., 2000;Islam, et al., 2010;Klienosky, et al., 2006;Odeh, 2002) which approaches the inner-county level analysis. Research on inner-county vulnerability dynamics presents an opportunity to provide descriptive information for assisting local emergency management officials to more effectively allocate critical resources during and after a storm event. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina ravaged the northern Gulf of Mexico. The American public watched news reports from New Orleans of residents who did not or, more likely, could not evacuate and remained stranded on rooftops for days after the storm as sewage festering flood waters swirled below. While this does not suggest malice to abandon residents, it does point to a much larger problem of sufficient resources for socially vulnerable populations . As well, the reality of an existing population who cannot provide transportation or adequate shelter before, during, and/or after a tropical cyclone is larger than most counties have resources to accommodate (Cutter et al., 2006;SWFRPC, 2010). County emergency management officials put great time and effort into accounting for population needs when planning for disaster mitigation. However, the majority of data and literature on disaster management planning focuses on the logistical concerns for notifying residents to evacuate and facilitating the movement of residents out of harm's way (Lee County Florida, 2009;SWFRPC, 2010). These two efforts account for the greatest challenges due to the bulk of the population will have access to a vehicle and/or access to shelter for evacuation and sheltering purposes (SWFRPC, 2010). Local emergency management plans do account for those populations without personal transportation and/or adequate shelter access (Lee County Florida, 2009). However, the populations of a community who are frequently marginalized due to economic and demographic considerations on a regular basis, apart from a disaster scenario, are more likely to receive less assistance during an evacuation scenario (Cutter et al., 2003). This suggests that while plans exist for the accountability of all residents, application of written plans can fall short. Thus, current plans for reaching locations of socially vulnerable populations may be underserved and thus illustrate an obligation to better understand diverse community safety needs in order to more effectively appropriate resources."}, {"section_title": "Coastally Significant Terms Defined", "text": "SLOSH (Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes) is a computerized model developed by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to estimate storm surge heights and winds resulting from historical, hypothetical, and predicted hurricanes by taking into account: pressure, forward speed, size, track, and winds (NOAA, 2004). Figure 1 displays the SLOSH coverage for the United States, which extends coastally from the Gulf of Mexico throughout New England along the Atlantic Ocean. The SLOSH basin for this study is a bi-polar elliptical where the center of gravity is two focal points from where the grid emanates. Figure 2 displays the SLOSH grid itself which is a network of squares which gain size when traveling away from the foci. Analysis for this study provides the SLOSH as a contributing piece of data which was necessary to generate the storm surge GIS file during a previous research effort. This effort was conducted by the SWFRPC in 2010. Direct geoprocessing of SLOSH data is not a function of this study. Rather, the SLOSH definition is provided here as a reference for greater background depth.  (Cutter et al., 2003). They developed a metric, the Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI), for determining social vulnerabilities to natural disasters nationwide using county level jurisdictional boundaries as enumeration units. They illustrated the SoVI metric at the county extent from utilizing US Census county aggregated Figure 2 The SLOSH basin for southwest Florida socioeconomic data. This research will also use census data as the identifier for representing socioeconomic characteristics though within a county rather than between counties. Storm surge inundation layer is the product of a GIS modeling effort where the SLOSH, inland stretches of contiguous water, and elevation data (Digital Elevation Model, DEM) are integrated into an overlay analysis to determine the maximum amount of potential overland flooding from storm surge at high tide. The storm surge GIS file was created as part of an earlier study conducted by the SWFRPC in 2010 (SWFRPC, 2010). The storm surge data itself is a GIS layer classified into polygons of intensifying category of storm from the coast traveling inland (tropical storm, categories 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). The storm surge is used here to demonstrate the increasing magnitude of vulnerability as a storm increases and how inland populations are affected."}, {"section_title": "Research Objective", "text": "The research objective is to modify methods developed by Cutter et al. (2003) for measuring social vulnerabilities to natural hazards at the county level to determine potential social vulnerabilities to storm surge flood water within Lee County, Florida. The intent here is to organize the participating datasets and variables into an overlay analysis where simple addition returns the final numeric value which represents the level of vulnerability intensity. Social vulnerability is a real concern for emergency management officials who seek current, detailed information to better plan for disaster scenarios. While Cutter et al. (2003) research provides valuable methodology for federal and state agencies to better understand county aggregate vulnerabilities during a real storm event, local emergency management plans, which are the first to be ordered, require greater detail for inner-county realities. County emergency management officials are only responsible for the population within their given jurisdiction. This sub-county research model will award local emergency management officials expanded analytical tools to appropriate additional resources in possible underserved locations. US Census county extent data is used by Cutter et al. (2003) at the national level for comparison between counties. While the national extent is a powerful research scale for understanding sensitivities in an entire country, most disasters are local or regional in scope and are initially approached with local mitigation and resources before state and federal allocation (SWFRPC, 2010). This county extent approach provides an opportunity to create additional tools to assist disaster management to better account for residents who may be otherwise marginalized during normal times and require additional effort for disaster scenario planning."}, {"section_title": "Study Area", "text": "The study area for this research is Lee County, Florida. Lee County is a coastal community located in southwest Florida along the Gulf of Mexico. Figure 3 displays Lee County and adjacent counties.    (Cutter et al., 2000). This seminal research utilized GIS overlay analysis and established population vulnerabilities based on geographic vicinity (hazard of place) to existing potential hazards. For example, residential location to rivers or coastline, dams, and power plants would prove higher vulnerability than those dwellings farther away from similar locations. Furthermore, they briefly focused on the term social vulnerability, but the difference here is that the demographic variables used were not weighted variables included in the calculation formula for the measured social vulnerability intensity. Weighted variables provide a numeric quality that helps to quantify the pre-existing circumstances which are exacerbated during and after a storm event. Rather, they presented the demographic information as the raw number of those classified populations affected by a potential hazardous event and not how the pre-existing socioeconomic inequalities contributed to social vulnerabilities during a storm event. While this 2000 study enumerated vulnerability into socioeconomic classification, the SoVI metric had yet to be developed. SoVI analysis focuses on a wide range of hazards including but not limited to hurricane derived storm surge for coastal areas. Cutter et al. (2003) metric is holistic in scale which includes variables that are not coastally deterministic sensitivities for southwest Florida such as: wildfire, earthquake potential, and hazardous waste. This research will provide analysis results that are specific to southwest Florida's greatest disaster threat: hurricane storm surge. While Cutter et al. (2003) research is broad focused, the general nature can accommodate a scaled down approach. Since the original research is based on a calculation of interchangeable, yet similar variables, and these records are available for every location in the country, the SoVI approach is quite malleable in function. They specifically explained that their method is flexible enough to use for any natural disaster and to include local socioeconomic dynamics as the circumstances require for a given location. This scaled down approach awards the user an introductory understanding of inner-county social vulnerabilities and assists in highlighting where resources may be expanded. SoVI has been referenced and studied at length by Dr. Cutter, but validation of SoVI functional value is evident in the distinct application by others in the emergency management field.  (CDCP, 2007). SoVI is not only a tool for assessment, but has also become a topic of discussion in its theory and usage. Levine (2007) used SoVI to research population and housing issues from disasters. Lowe et al., (2007) applied Cutter et al. (2003) work for hazards of place to risk assessment for volcanic islands. Kumpulainen (2006) used Cutter et al (2003) definition of social vulnerability to discuss conceptual issues in hazard assessment methods. These studies have incorporated SoVI directly or its theory in concept, to distant locations and geographic scale. While certain methodological aspects of these published studies are each similar to this research scope, none of these are specific to southwest Florida. Existing research and discussion of social vulnerability for the state of Florida is very general in scope and little effort has been conducted to apply scientific tools for empirical evidence in order to better understand location-based social vulnerability to storm surge. There is currently limited sub-county social vulnerability research conducted for  Florida, 2009). However, the ETOP is largely dependent upon pre-registration of special needs population. While a contact method may be an effective form of service for many residents of the county to seek assistance, linguistically isolated populations are at an immediate loss when incapable of notifying emergency services of their need. Nepal et al. (2009) emphasize that language barriers are a common obstacle for immigrants to gain local knowledge about disaster preparedness and seek assistance or resources. In addition, undocumented migrants in southern Florida are a fast growing demographic who, not only have limited language competency, but may also have an apprehension towards contacting emergency services for fear of deportation (Nepal et al., 2010). The ETOP also mentions specific neighborhoods in the county where higher populations of low and low-middle income residents live (Lee County Florida, 2009). This plan provides transportation for residents who do not have reliable transportation, at designated high ridership bus stops. This is an important procedure to maintain during and after a storm event, but behavioral analyses suggest that many residents will wait until the last minute to make an evacuation decision and/or will seek shelter in a primary residence (SWFRPC, 2010). The Lee County ETOP makes effort to deliver evacuation and recovery services to all residents in need, but considering limited disaster preparedness knowledge, language barriers, lack of personal resources to evacuate, and the potential stubborn human behavior; the need for additional social vulnerability awareness is desperately needed at the local level. In addition to the functional application of SoVI is the attention SoVI research has attained by Dr. Cutter's own testimony on Capitol Hill in 2006 (Cutter, 2006). Regarding the need for expanded social vulnerability research, Dr. Cutter testified before the House of Representatives Subcommittee on Research about the importance of social science in disaster preparedness and response. Dr. Cutter explained to the subcommittee that the discipline of, \"vulnerability science is an emergent multi-disciplinary field\", where there needs to be, \"improvements in the metrics, models, and methods for social vulnerability assessments\". Cutter also explained that existing efforts in disaster field research, \"tells us that there are pre-existing conditions that make certain social groups -the poor, the elderly, non-English speaking residents -more vulnerable to and slower to recover from disasters\". Cutter then described the SoVI metric and displayed mapping examples at the county level for where socially vulnerable populations reside. While SoVI is an established metric, it is not alone when assessing social vulnerabilities. Other studies have provided indicators of social vulnerability and most agree on the contributing characteristics to social vulnerability, but have different approaches for measuring these pre-existing conditions. Social vulnerability requires the quantification of the human condition, Dwyer et al. (2004) provided a method for quantifying social vulnerability in western Australia using thirteen vulnerability indicators. In May 2010, the US Department of Transportation (USDOT) published a report for special needs population evacuation for hurricane planning (USDOT, 2010). USDOT identified previous research, similar to SoVI, where spatial analysis tools utilize Census data for better understanding social vulnerability. Though the USDOT study is intended for coastal communities where hurricane evacuation planning is necessary, the tools mentioned are applicable across different geographic regions. For example, Clark et al. (1998) used thirty-four census variables and conducted calculations using percentages of the population. Kleinosky et al. (2006) used fifty-seven variables at the block group level. Odeh (2002) used population density for vulnerability assessment. The SoVI measurement process itself has also been tested to understand how it functions under adjusted variations. Schmidtlein et al. (2008) focused on altering the indices of the SoVI methodology to understand the sensitivity of the model. This particular study is important to note in that it altered the scale and variables in various geographic locations to test its strength for reproduction of accurate social vulnerability assessments regardless of scale, location, and variables. This study concludes in stating confidence in SoVI application, but cautions users to gain detailed knowledge in scale and location because local characteristics are unique. Though SoVI is not alone in its focus, the intent for this research study is to utilize the SoVI methodology and research background for creating an introductory analyses of social vulnerability for Lee County, Florida. completed one of the first SLOSH model and storm surge inundation analysis projects in the country (SWFRPC, 2010). This analysis has traditionally been updated within a larger evacuation study conducted by the eleven Regional Planning Council (RPC) agencies across the state. While the RPCs have the unique regional capacity and expertise to execute such a voluminous study, this resulted in different methodologies as well as update timelines. In 2006, the state of Florida contracted with the eleven RPCs across the state to update all existing evacuation studies in one coordinated effort. This endeavor has benefited the state with the 2010 publication of eleven regionally conducted studies with one methodology and one consistent template as a foundation for future updates (SWFRPC, 2010). This statewide effort provides copious material for local emergency management planning officials for adjustment and adaptation of existing and future plans to effectively preserve the wellness of its population."}, {"section_title": "A History and Assessment of Storm Surge Research", "text": "While each regional study contains valuable storm surge data for the state of Florida, there is little consideration for social vulnerability assessment. Attempts to isolate populations that are potentially at risk to storm surge due to an established lack of personal resources for securing evacuation transportation or adequate shelter do not provide substantial information for determining the location of those sensitive residents. The location is important for emergency management officials to better plan for the after disaster first responders to understand where residents are located who may need attention first. There are local plans to provide assistance to members of the population who may not have resources to evacuate, yet these plans are focused on the rider population at bus stops in order to determine the locations for providing transport busses to emergency shelters (Lee County Florida, 2009). This method does not account for residential locations of sensitive populations, but rather the bus stop location. Furthermore, this plan accounts only for those residents who are physically incapable of evacuation and no mention for residents who are vulnerable due to pre-existing socioeconomic conditions. Local emergency management plans can benefit from information which suggests where these sensitive populations generally reside along with the locations of bus stops with high ridership numbers. Socially vulnerable populations, who do not maintain resources to evacuate out of harm's way, often seek shelter within their respective residence or a nearby residence with other residents who experience similar socioeconomic circumstances (SWFRPC, 2010;USDOT, 2010;Nepal et al., 2010). Considering the reality that certain members of the population will seek shelter within a residential location, it is imperative that local emergency management officials understand that during, and after a storm event, there exists a portion of the population who are not only sheltered in a potentially unsafe structure, but also lack the means to properly care for themselves following a storm. These residents require unique attention during the planning stages of disaster mitigation and this research provides an additional tool to account for more of the local population. This method does not make adjustments for the potential to double count residents who fit into more than one of these pre-storm socioeconomic characteristics. It is quite possible that some residents possess all three of these pre-storm conditions and are represented in all three variables. However, a percentage is used here as a standardized numeric format for calculation, representing a ranking of sensitivity and not the actual population amount. It is likely this method does in fact double or triple count population, but the result simply highlights a higher social vulnerability for a location. Fourth, the storm surge data is reclassified by using each category of storm to determine an intensity rating. This intensity rating is a cumulative percentage where tropical storm receives the lowest intensity rating due to its lower destructive nature and category five storm will receive the highest rating due to its large magnitude of destructive capability. Fifth, Census tract data is converted into raster format from vector format. Sixth, storm surge GIS data is organized by category of storm into six individual GIS raster layers; these six layers represent each of the storm categories: tropical storm, and categories 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Raster format is used here for the calculation to operate within the spatial context as the layers overlay one another rather than a tabular calculation. This research set raster cell size for all raster images at one hundred linear feet. One hundred linear feet was chosen based upon the original storm surge model output resolution, ten linear feet. Ten foot resolution contains one hundred times greater detail than one hundred foot resolution, meaning that the cell size of a one hundred linear foot cell is one hundred times as large, thus less detail. The decision to use one hundred foot resolution was based solely on computer processing time. Processing two raster images for six iterations at ten linear feet was exponentially greater than increasing the raster cell size to one hundred linear foot resolution and processing those larger cells. Spatial analysis tools award raster processing greater functionality than vector format when calculating data between multiple layers. Seventh, an overlay process is conducted in six iterations where each category of storm surge intensity rating is added to the census numeric value from step three, above. Finally, all six GIS layer outputs are presented to display the location and severity of residential social vulnerability for a given storm."}, {"section_title": "Description of Data Sources", "text": "In order for this research to utilize storm surge GIS data, it is imperative that the storm surge model integrate vital pieces of spatial data which are specific to that modeling process. The GIS data used for creation of the storm surge layer   The Lee County DEM covers all land features and has a five foot linear resolution. Lee County DEM is used in the storm surge inundation model by providing land elevation. Specifically, if the SLOSH surge value is higher than the elevation value, that particular model raster cell is classified as wet and given the surge tide height value. By using the extent of each SLOSH grid cell, this process is repeated until all areas within one SLOSH grid cell is calculated. The SWFRPC chose ten foot linear resolution for this process to achieve a desired local detail (SWFRPC, 2010)."}, {"section_title": "Census Data Preparation", "text": "The  Census tract variables will have higher numeric values for those locations where there are more residents sharing similar socioeconomic circumstances. These three attributes are separated into individual fields for each census tract record within the county and, when summed, generate an overall portrait of the local pre-existing socioeconomic circumstances contributing to social vulnerability."}, {"section_title": "Storm Surge Data Preparation", "text": "Social vulnerability to storm surge flood water requires the use of existing modeled data to detail the potential for overland storm surge from a hurricane event. The storm surge inundation layer for Lee County is a GIS polygon model output completed in 2010 by the Southwest Florida Regional Planning Council.  "}, {"section_title": "Storm Surge Reclassification", "text": "The storm surge inundation layer does not have a numeric weight for participation in the social vulnerability calculation and needs an appropriate value for severity of disaster potential. This is accomplished by using the storm category to represent the severity of storm surge impact on a given location. Functionally, the storm surge layer will suggest that, for example, a tract which is within a category 2 storm surge receives a lower value of intensity (.49) than does a tract within a category 4 storm surge (.83). Furthermore, this process is cumulative, meaning the intensity of a tropical storm will not weigh as much as a category five storm, ensuring that less intense storms are not measured the same as their more fierce counterparts."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "This research conducts complex analysis from existing data through adjusting an established methodology, but it is also important to provide the research findings in simple graphic terms. Given the known census data limitations and the nature of storm surge information, there are additional limitations which require attention. Each census variable used here remains within their respective data range without normalization of variables into one common scale. The absence of normalizing these three variables into one range does not allow for a standard comparison between variables to understand the impact each variable may have on vulnerability intensity. A normalized data range is not applied here as the individual analysis of variables is not the intent of this research endeavor.   Step two determines if the three variables from step one need to be divided by the total tract population in order to return a percentage of the population. Since all three variables are presented as raw values these are divided by the total tract population. Linguistically isolated populations maintain a disproportionately higher level of difficulty for finding access to adequate transportation or shelter as well as comprehending local evacuation plans due to language barriers (Nepal et al., 2009). The Census Bureau classifies a household as linguistically isolated, \"if all household members 14 years or older speak a language other than English and have limited English proficiency\" (United States Census Bureau, 2003). Households with no vehicle and the population below the poverty line are locations with fewer personal resources to travel to adequate shelter before, during, or after a storm event and require special assistance (Cutter et al., 2003;SWFRPC, 2010). Step three sums the three census variables and populates these summed values into a new field. This is a new single field for each tract record in the county which represents a total numeric value of intensity for the pre-existing socioeconomic circumstances contributing to social vulnerability during and after a storm event. This summed value is used in the subsequent overlay calculation with each of the six storm surge raster images. Table 3 displays a table with the fields containing, from left to right: tract number, percent population with no vehicle, percent population that speaks English less than very well, percent population below poverty, and finally the summed socioeconomic vulnerability intensity before a storm. One whole number is added to the sum of the three census variables, across all records, acting as a normalized weight to the socioeconomic condition before a disaster event. This normalized value is to weigh the socioeconomic condition greater than that of the storm surge when compared separately. The intention is not to allow the highest storm surge value to be larger than the lowest socioeconomic value.  .33, .49, .66, and .83, respectively. Step five converts the census tract feature class to a raster image. This step is important for the overlay analysis to conduct addition calculation with each of the six raster images. This conversion allows the user to set the raster resolution for the newly created image. Here, the chosen resolution is 100 foot linear pixel resolution. Step six extracts each of the six unique storm surge intensity values through raster conversion using the previously calculated storm surge intensity field from step four. This conversion provides the user with the ability to identify a field to assign values to the new raster file. These six raster files represent the spatial extent for only that category of storm. Figure 9 through 14 present these raster spatial extents for each category of storm. Step seven performs separate mathematical addition calculations between each of the six storm surge files and the summed Census tract socioeconomic variables. This is an overlay process where the numeric storm category intensity rating is added to the Census vulnerability intensity rating. This calculation returns a numeric value representing the spatial distribution for social vulnerability intensity within Lee County, Florida. Step eight manually reviews calculation results from step seven for errors and consistency between the six output files. This step highlights the calculation limitations when using raster files for mathematic operation. These review methods are not automated and require attention to tabular and spatial detail. Familiarity with tabular data is necessary for manual review of calculation results. Inconsistencies are largely isolated in steps 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. These five steps are data reclassification and conversion functions which may contribute to erroneous final results if not followed accurately. For example, if the final results for category three storm covers more area or has greater social vulnerability rates than the results for category four storm, then it is possible that the category of storm reclassification, or perhaps conversion step, were incorrectly labeled or converted by switching the spatial and tabular information. This hypothetical mishap may be a label error at best or demand complete spatial and tabular recalculation at worst. This step also examines social vulnerability spatial distribution characteristics within the county. If errors are found, this step is the point of review to isolate the error and return to the necessary step for revision. Step nine presents the final results of social vulnerability to storm surge for Lee County, Florida. This step identifies the analysis limitations, highlights what has been accomplished, creates cartographic representations for visual aide, and begins the narrative explanation for the entire process. CHAPTER 4 ANALYSIS RESULTS AND DISCUSSION"}, {"section_title": "Census Data Analysis Results and Discussion", "text": "Census data availability, update timeline, and compatibility issues required considerable attention and alteration to proposed research methodology and necessitated additional data manipulations. However, these unavoidable challenges were accommodated in fashion to remain loyal to the intended focus of this research endeavor: to study inner county social vulnerability dynamics to storm surge flood waters for Lee County, Florida. Successful Census data manipulation provided one file containing all three identified socioeconomic variables; these records were summed into one new field. The summed value is a numerically weighted intensity rating which highlights locations in the county where the propensity for greater vulnerability during and after a storm is examined before a storm event. Figure 15 provides the pre-storm, inner county, socioeconomic profile between the three variables used in this research: population below poverty line, population with a language barrier, and population without personal vehicular means of transportation. The values in figure 15 are thirteen quintile classification ranges. Thirteen classified ranges were chosen in order to provide more detailed differentiation between variables that are numerically close, but whose value represents a reality which is quite distinct and are functionally distant human social circumstances. The small range of values is 1 to 1.7; however these values have enough places behind the decimal to further describe the differences in socioeconomic profile. This range is only within one numeric value: greater than 1 and less than 2. The data reclassification process calculated the percentage of population for the three Census variables in each tract. The percentage of the population represents the social condition, but also the potential socioeconomic vulnerability. These three field percentage values were added together as numbers behind the decimal into a new field. Then, one whole number (1) was added to that summed value, for each tract record, as a normalized weight against the storm surge intensity. The overall numeric range of values is rather small and a dramatic color pallet is also used to further express the reality of the social condition. The three highest ranges were highlighted with a darker color to distinguish these values from those, statistically nearby, slightly lower, ranking. This was also done to draw attention to those locations for the highest level of pre-storm vulnerability potential. In Lee County, barrier island communities are located in the western portion of the county. These communities are geographically disconnected from the mainland county by water. Access to most of these locations is available by traveling over connecting bridges. In figure 15, we find that pre-existing socioeconomic conditions are not great concerns for the island communities, but rather inland locations exhibit significant differences than locations closer to the coast. In particular is the location between State Highway 41 and Interstate Highway 75. Other higher values persist in disconnected locations in south and east Lee County. It is important to understand the pre-storm conditions in order to digest the final social vulnerability results. These pre-storm conditions are the main contributor to the overall social vulnerability intensity."}, {"section_title": "Storm Surge Data Analysis Results and Discussion", "text": "Storm surge data required little manipulation, relative to the challenges Census data presented. The spatial analysis process between storm surge and Census geography are location dependent measurements where population characteristics within a tract and the intersecting category of storm intensity be summed for creating unique social vulnerability intensity values for an ultimate county wide comparison of inner county dynamics. Considering the nature of overlay analysis, where no one census tract has only one storm surge value, storm surge physiology is not absolute and is a rather complex, irregular composition. The need to visualize inner county dynamics through all categories of storms, it was imperative that each storm category be extracted from the aggregated file for efficient and effective mathematical operation. Furthermore, separating each category of storm was necessary to accurately apply a storm category intensity rating for each storm category full geographic extent. Figure 7 provides the aggregated storm surge. Note in figure 7 that all six storm categories are represented, yet to use this file would return a misleading social vulnerability rating. For example, the storm category closest to the coast is a tropical storm which has a numeric intensity rating of .16 and the farthest overland stretches of inundation is a category five storm with a .96 intensity rating. If this aggregated file were used locations nearest the coast would use the .16 value only and some inland locations would use the .96 rating only. This method is incorrect in that it suggests that the coastal locations do not experience the ferocity of a category five storm, quite the contrary. In fact, residents nearer the coast will undoubtedly experience more property damage and be exposed to greater danger from flooding than those residents who are farther inland (SWFRPC, 2010). This is largely due to the proximity to open water and lower elevations at the coast. This brief example and figure 7 explain that, without individual files representing only one storm category, the county wide storm characteristics from one storm category to another cannot be visualized. Storm surge inundation is a cumulative effect where all storms travel from the coast inland and the next higher storm picks up relative to where the lower storm stopped and continues overland. Using the aggregated file, which is only intended for cartographic purposes, will not allow the mathematic operation to accurately provide each tract with social vulnerability intensity for each storm category. This problem is accommodated by extracting each spatial extent of storm surge into six separate raster files. Each newly created raster image maintains the full spatial extent of each category of storm. The surface which each storm inundation represents is the farthest inland stretch of storm surge flood water and that inundated area contains one constant storm intensity value over the entire flooded landscape. For example, a category two storm surge, where inundation is represented, provides a constant value of .49 for the entire surface. Upland locations, where flood waters are not estimated, are considered areas without storm surge inundation thus are dry portions with no data and receive a value of zero. These locations do not participate in the social vulnerability calculation, but the underlying pre-existing socioeconomic profile is represented by itself as these areas do not intersect the storm surge inundation."}, {"section_title": "Overlay Analysis Results", "text": "The culmination of this research endeavor is to estimate social vulnerability to storm surge flood waters for Lee County, Florida. When the addition function is finished, a new raster is created, representing the sum of two raster images. This process is iterative where the raster containing unique values of pre-existing socioeconomic conditions is combined to one of the six storm category raster files. Figures 16 through 21 display the six final outputs from the calculation process. The social vulnerability for tropical storm and category one is not clear due to the slight inland extent of storm surge potential. Not until category two storm do we begin to have a better visualization for comparative analysis. Category two is the first inland extent of potential storm surge flood water which intersect locations identified, in figure 15, exhibiting higher pre-storm vulnerability potential. While only small portions are calculated, the locations of higher social vulnerability to a category two storm are just south of the river and in the extreme southern portion of the county. We also begin to see how the barrier island communities in western Lee County already have a lower social vulnerability to storm surge when compared to measured locations inland. Categories three and four further exemplify the locations of concentrated high social vulnerability. Western Lee County is a location with generally moderate social vulnerability whereas the barrier island communities continue to be the lowest concentrations of socially vulnerable residents. However, we still do not have the fullest extent of storm surge.  With each increasing storm category the intensity range increases. New locations are only included in the calculation as the storm inundation extent increases. Some locations which exhibit high pre-storm vulnerability values may not be included until larger storm intensity maps. This means that when the locations which have higher pre-storm vulnerability values are included in the inundation calculation, the intensity range increases too. The overall range for all category storms, from low to high, is 1.01 to 2.73.  All output raster files do not account for the entire county extent. This is the biggest limitation for adequate assessment of county population vulnerability. However, the socioeconomic realities within Lee County can be understood by reviewing data between any of the final maps. For example, in figure 22 we find that the tropical storm extent is rather slight, only existing along the near shore and barrier island locations. These locations have the highest distribution of wealth and some of the lowest population densities in the county (SWFRPC, 2010). The ability for many of these residents to use personal resources for evacuation is very high. By comparing the calculated areas to those outside of the tropical storm extent, we find distant locations experiencing greater vulnerability without even participating in the overlay analysis calculation. The barrier island and near shore communities have lower final social vulnerability ratings than that of some inland locations where the pre-existing socioeconomic circumstances persist at greater volumes than that of wealthier, coastal communities who have participated in the overlay calculation. Social vulnerability concerns for most barrier island communities do not necessitate great resource allocations in a disaster event. Figures 22 through 26 can be misleading in that they display green symbology for many of the uncalculated areas of the county. This suggests that, for a given storm category, those locations are not vulnerable. This is actually best described as those census tracts which are simply not participating in the calculation rather than a lesser storm vulnerability. The reality is that hurricane danger will not cease based on the edge of hypothetical inundation line. The best cartographic product for understanding the county social vulnerability is figure 27. Category five storm surge provides a spatially equal calculation which provides a constant value across the landscape for understanding storm surge affected socioeconomic sensitivities. Likewise, barrier islands maintain lower vulnerability to storm surge based on personal resources than some inland locations. Local knowledge suggests that barrier island and near coast communities maintain higher income and property levels than some inland locations. It is not surprising to find this pre-storm economic reality is the catalyst for social vulnerability intensity. The final six output raster images depict a range of intensity for residential social vulnerability locations to storm surge for each category of tropical cyclone. This intensity range is a product of several data reclassifications and overlay calculations. Each final raster image provides insight for the residential locations of socially vulnerable population concentrations for a given storm. This research assigns an intensity value to the extent of each storm category due in part to the format in which the storm surge data is delivered from the storm surge model. The final output from the storm surge model provides a range of flood water for each storm category. This research is dependent upon the addition of values with places behind the decimal. To incorporate additional data requires that data to, at the very least, be in the form of an integer. There is no discernable way to add a range of flood water to unique numeric values. Also, the intent of this research is not the amount of flood water or location of that flood water. Rather, this study focus is based upon sensitive populations who may be unaccounted or less than considered for during a storm event. It is true that there is no variation within each storm category to express the flood differences across the landscape. However, as the analysis results show, some locations have higher social vulnerability without storm impact than other near shore locations do with storm impact. For example, in tropical storm and category one storms flood inundation impacts the barrier island and near shore communities and returns a social vulnerability which is lower than some inland locations that these same storms do not impact. This suggests that there are areas of the county which have prestorm social vulnerabilities that are higher without storm impact than other locations with the added storm affect. In addition, considering that flood water will always be greater closer to the shore, it is possible that using flood water amounts will again overshadow the near shore locations while losing sight of the Census variables were added together to create one numeric vulnerability ranking. This calculation utilized ACS data which is not cross-tabulated. This means that it is likely residential populations may belong to more than one of the chosen socioeconomic characteristics for this research, thus, resulting in double or triple counting of individual residents. Though, double and triple counting is likely, this method was applied equally across the extent of the study area allowing for all Census tracts to participate based upon these chosen variables. While double or triple counting of residents may appear to artificially inflate the social vulnerability of a location, it is not a focus of this research to study the amount of potentially affected population. However, in an operational setting it is imperative to understand the unique circumstances of the local population to better serve those needs. These are concentrations of human vulnerabilities and if an individual possesses more than one of these characteristics, that puts that person a greater disadvantage than an individual who only belongs to one or none of these categories. This vulnerability is exacerbated when spread out over many residents. In order to create concentrations of vulnerable populations, many individuals share similar socioeconomic characteristics. This means that large populations reside within several adjacent Census tracts and, when visualized within the county spatial context, these areas present highly compacted concentrations of potentially vulnerable residents. Population percentage is used in this research as a standardized numeric format for ease of calculation and is not used to accentuate the sensitive population. Furthermore, raw population numbers are not used in analysis or discussion due to possible misleading conclusions which double or triple counting presents. While double or triple counting is likely in this research, it is intended here to highlight local circumstances for ultimate functional usage in an operational setting. If an individual belongs to all three Census variables, then that does create a greater sensitivity which can be digested as a whole or extracted to understand the elements leading to vulnerability. These variables can be itemized to better understand local vulnerabilities and assist local emergency management officials to allocate appropriate resources for these unique, localized circumstances. When consumed as a whole, this data provides concentrations of population who share these socioeconomic characteristics. The preceding research focus is consistently attentive to county geographic and population dynamics. While storm surge does affect residents closer to open water more dramatically than further inland locations, local knowledge and empirical data suggest that barrier island and near shore communities maintain a greater ability, through personal resources, to evacuate from and to seek shelter during and after a storm event. Finally, this study begins to shed light on preexisting socioeconomic circumstances at the local level which minimize the ability for residents to access evacuation transportation and seek adequate shelter during and after a tropical cyclone event. These preexisting conditions help to explain how a community can stress the resource limitations during a storm event to assist local residents to seek economic empowerment through identifying local disparities and thus enriching the community in normal times, apart from a storm scenario. Within each storm category the dynamic nature of a storm is not equal for all locations. This research provided one numeric intensity value over the entire category of storm extent. More attention should focus on the variation within each category of storm. For example, within any given storm the destructiveness is not always the same inland as it is near shore. It is important to provide a method which begins to more accurately replicate how a storm affects all communities based upon location. However, close consideration of this item is necessary in order to remain focused on social vulnerabilities and not let the dramatic nature of flood water, for example, over shadow the intent to provide research on the human condition. More in-depth analysis of the local infrastructure is necessary for an inner county research project to gain attention. Incorporating cadastral data from the county property appraiser will provide building information from parcel to parcel. This can help to understand potential property loss value, isolate residential buildings, and understand the structural integrity of a given structure during a storm. The amount of storm surge flood water is another important future research consideration. Expansion of this research should incorporate the amount of flood water as a driving variable. However, using storm surge flood amount should be used with extreme caution when conducting social vulnerability. Near shore communities will have persistently higher flood amounts than inland locations. This creates the potential for coastal communities to appear more socially vulnerable than other inland locations, may generate erroneous analysis, and ultimately prove to be a disservice to the residents this type of research is intended to represent. Future research should utilize such data, but only when many new socioeconomic variables are considered and a normalizing factor is used. This can be achieved by simply adding a weight to the entire socioeconomic landscape. This will allow for those truly sensitive locations to be portrayed truthfully alongside the more affluent locations when flood water begins to impact the study area. This data has been developed by the SWFRPC in 2011 and is ready for analysis inclusion. The amount of storm surge can be used with the parcel fabric to understand the potential amount of flooded buildings, property loss, vertical flood depth for shelter vulnerability, and the ability to travel on roadways. Future research should remain at the county level by focusing on the inner county characteristics, but a more regional extent may be of greater value. While Future research should remain loyal to highlight socioeconomic disparities within local communities. These unfortunate realities persist as glaring blemishes contributing to the inability for human safety during a natural disaster (Cutter et al., 2003). The immediate desired result of this sort of study is to better accommodate residents who require additional resources to evacuate and seek adequate shelter during a hurricane event. Long term aspirations are to quantify an unpleasant social reality and encourage economic empowerment at the local level. Nationwide scale cannot account for the high detail of unique local community characteristics that the inner county extent is capable. The scale of this project should remain local with the intent that local scale is the appropriate location to enact meaningful change for a prosperous future for all residents. Local communities are better equipped to facilitate the needs of a marginalized population, understand the various personalities and relationships involved, and maintain a more personal atmosphere which often cultivates better communication. Finally, accepted research is validated through the application of scientific methods to quantify individuals, though personal safety is an immeasurable requirement all biotic life shares. Hopefully, this research can begin to assist populations on the fringes of society to provide safety mechanisms without the prerequisite of personal income to determine amount of safety."}]
