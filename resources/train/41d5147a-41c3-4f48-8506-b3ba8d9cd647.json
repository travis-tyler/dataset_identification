[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract: Rural areas of New York State (NYS) have higher rates of alcohol-related motor vehicle (MV) crash injury than metropolitan areas. While alcohol-related injury has declined across the three geographic regions of NYS, disparities persist with rural areas having smaller declines. Our study aim was to examine factors associated with alcohol-related MV crashes in Upstate and Long Island using multi-sourced county-level data that included the Crash Outcome Data Evaluation System (CODES) with emergency department visits and hospitalizations, traffic citations, demographic, economic, transportation, alcohol outlets, and Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCCS). A cross-sectional study design employed zero-truncated negative binominal regression models to assess relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Counties (n = 57, 56,000 alcohol-related crashes over the 3 year study timeframe) were categorized by mean annual alcohol-related MV injuries per 100,000 population: low (24.7 \u00b1 3.9), medium (33.9 \u00b1 1.7) and high (46.1 \u00b1 8.0) (p < 0.0001). In multivariable analyses, alcohol-related MV injury was elevated for non-adjacent, non-metropolitan counties (RR 2.5, 95% CI: 1.6-3.9) with higher citations for impaired driving showing a small, but significant protective effect. Less metropolitan areas had higher alcohol-related MV injury with inconsistent alcohol-related enforcement measures. In summary, higher alcohol-related MV injury rates in non-metropolitan counties demonstrated a dose-response relationship with proximity to a metropolitan area. These findings suggest areas where intervention efforts might be targeted to lower alcohol-related MV injury."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Declines have been reported in alcohol-related motor vehicle (MV) crashes in New York State (NYS) over the last decade; however, improvements have not been uniform across the three distinct NYS geographic areas: New York City (NYC), Long Island, and Upstate (the rest of NYS) [1] [2] [3] . The counties comprising these regions vary in the degree to which they possess characteristics previously reported to be associated with alcohol-impaired driving, crash risk and crash-related injury and mortality [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] ."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": "We employed a cross-sectional study design using the NYS Crash Outcome Data Evaluation System (CODES) [13] containing medical and law enforcement information with other multi-sourced county-level characteristics to examine our hypotheses related to factors associated with disparities in alcohol-related MV injury rates observed in regions of NYS.

Specifically, in the two less urban regions of NYS, Long Island and Upstate, we employ multi-sourced county-level data [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] , including categories created from Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCCs) [22] , to examine county-level factors associated with alcohol-related injury across low, medium and high alcohol-related MV injury counties."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources", "text": "NYS CODES data links police and motorist MV crash reports to discharge records from hospital inpatient care and emergency department visits collected through the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS). Multiple identifying factors such as gender, date of birth, social security number and name are used to link individuals from the crash reports to the hospital records. Probabilistic linkage then uses the identifying factors to estimate the probability that two of the records are in fact the same person from the same event through use of the software, LinkSolv 8.3 (Strategic Matching, Inc., Morrisonville, NY, USA), a product from Strategic Matching, Inc. LinkSolv, used widely to link records for many different purposes, has been used extensively by traffic safety researchers to prepare and link police crash records, EMS ambulance response records and emergency department and inpatient hospital treatment records [13, 23] . Cases require both a crash report as well as an inpatient or outpatient record. Probabilistic linkage uses identifying factors to estimate the probability that two of the records are in fact the same person from the same event. The CODES linkage is robust, with strong and consistent linkage probabilities, and a high sensitivity for accurately linking cases. Based on calculations performed using the Strategic Matching, Inc. (Linksolv 8.3), there was a sensitivity of 99.96% and a specificity of 82.98% pooled across three linkage iterations.\nAll county-level injury and mortality data provided by the NYS Department of Health (NYS DOH) [13] was merged with a county-level analytic data set built by aggregating and then merging publicly available data sources [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] .

"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This study used multi-sourced data to identify counties in the Upstate and Long Island regions of NYS with high rates of alcohol-related MV crash injury. Higher alcohol-related MV injury rates occurred in non-metropolitan counties and demonstrated a dose-response relationship with proximity to a metropolitan area. In addition to inter-regional disparities, this study documents significant intra-regional differences and provides clues to areas where focused intervention efforts might be effective in lowering NYS alcohol-related MV injury. Increasing distance from a metropolitan area was associated with more alcohol-related citations per 100,000 population, but there was no difference across regions in the proportion of alcohol-related citations to total moving citations and there was a significantly lower proportion of interlock citations to total alcohol-related citations in the less metropolitan areas. Although numbers were small, neither on-premise or off-premise serving alcohol establishments per 100,000 population differed across the RUCC categories, but there were significantly fewer transportation alternatives-fewer licensed taxis-in the less metropolitan areas.\nA unique feature of the study is that it used linked hospital and police data to identify and categorize counties into three levels of alcohol-related MV injury and then examined how population, transportation, enforcement and economic factors differed across the three levels of alcohol-related MV injury. Earlier work had demonstrated disparities and an uneven decline in alcohol-related MV injury across the three major regions comprising NYS (NYC, Upstate, and Long Island) [1] [2] [3] . This study extends those findings and documents that disparities also exist within the sub-regions comprising the large number of counties in Upstate where metropolitan areas and areas adjacent to metropolitan areas experience lower alcohol-related MV injury than nonadjacent areas.\nAn inverse association was observed between alcohol-related MV injury and proximity to a metropolitan area. In the Long Island region, metropolitan areas exhibited the lowest alcohol-related MV injury rates, followed by non-metropolitan areas adjacent to a metropolitan area, with the highest alcohol-related MV injury rates being in non-metropolitan areas not adjacent to a metropolitan area. This pattern was observed despite metropolitan areas having a significantly greater number of alcohol establishments per road mile. Although this finding is consistent with previous examinations of the three major areas comprising NYS that show metropolitan NYC to have the lowest rates of alcohol-related MV injury [1] [2] [3] , this extends the findings of previous reports which did not examine the large Upstate region's 55 counties by RUCCs, socioeconomic, transportation or population characteristics.\nOur study demonstrated an inconsistent association with alcohol establishment selling density depending on whether it was measured per capita or per road mile. Per capita serving for on-premise consumption and selling for off-premise consumption showed a non-significant bivariate relationship to MV injury, while alcohol-related MV crash injury per road mile showed an inverse relationship for both on-premise and off-premise alcohol establishments. Previous studies in California and elsewhere found positive associations between bar density and risk of alcohol-related MV crashes [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] although it should be noted that some of these studies also included property damage only crashes as well as those producing injury or did not control for other environmental factors such as rurality, geographic proximity to an urban area, socioeconomic factors or alternative transportation availability and accessibility.\nThe finding of lower availability of alternative transportation such as taxis and lower income levels, suggests that the impact of recently introduced ride hailing services, not available during the timeframe of this study [15] , may be muted by lower income levels and affordability. Alternative transportation may be limited in rural areas contributing to lower use of taxi services in counties with fewer licensed taxicabs if the wait time is prohibitively long or costs are prohibitively high.\nThe availability and affordability of alternative forms of transportation, such as subways, buses, ride hailing services, safe ride services and taxis, have been noted previously to impact DWAI rates [32] . Expansion of the hours of operation of the Washington, DC Metro by three hours was associated with a decrease in the probability of being arrested for a DWAI in neighborhoods with at least one bar within 100 meters of a metro station. The number of alcohol consumers who chose to drive home decreased by nearly 20%. Other results from a small study analyzing surveys collected from users of safe ride services at bars found that safe ride services attract patrons at high risk for DWAI [32] . These reports, coupled with the findings of our study that show increased alcohol-related MV injury in areas with limited transportation alternatives, suggest that offering alternative forms of transportation may have a significant role in reducing impaired driving.\nWe observed higher alcohol-related citations in counties in the medium and high alcohol-related injury categories compared to counties with low alcohol-related injury, but we were not able to differentiate those given because of a crash. Similarly, alcohol-related citations comprised a higher proportion of all moving traffic citations in the medium and high alcohol-related injury categories. Since the implementation of the Child Passenger Protection Act of 2010 (Leandra's Law), any person convicted of driving while intoxicated (DWI)/DWAI in NYS is mandated to have an alcohol ignition interlock device installed on all vehicles they own or operate [33] . While alcohol citations were higher in geographic areas with increased injury, there was no difference observed in the proportion of interlock citations among alcohol-related citations in these areas. In fact, when examined by RUCC category, the proportion of interlock citations to total alcohol-related citations was inversely related to both alcohol-related injury and to metropolitan status. It is not clear whether law enforcement in rural areas, with the highest alcohol-related MV injury, is not detecting, not ticketing or whether rural residents are more compliant with their interlocks.\nThe implementation of mandatory interlock devices for alcohol driving violations has been reported to lower recidivism while they are in place [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . Drivers enrolled in interlock programs have been reported to be 15%-65% less likely to be re-arrested for driving under the influence (DWAI) [34] . Meta-analysis studies found that alcohol ignition interlock devices are effective at reducing drunk driving recidivism while installed in participants' vehicles [34, 39] . In a randomized trial, a 65% reduction in re-arrests for DWAI was observed in the interlock group compared to a control group [34] . However, other studies have suggested interlocks are effective only as long as they are installed in the vehicles of impaired drivers [35] . A case-control study observed a significant difference in the rate of DWAI recidivism comparing first-time offenders with installed interlocks to first-time offenders without interlocks. The differences in recidivism disappeared when the group with interlocks had them uninstalled [39] . These findings suggest the need for further investigation of this approach as a potential avenue through which less metropolitan areas of NYS might lower their alcohol-related MV injury rates."}, {"section_title": "Study Limitations", "text": "This study has limitations. We did not stratify by citations issued during a road stop that was not associated with a crash. Future analyses should use the NYS CODES to differentiate citations given in road stops from those issued following a crash to disentangle and differentiate preventive alcohol-related driving enforcement from DWAI citations conferred post-crash due to an alcohol-related crash. We used alcohol-related and interlock-related law enforcement citations. These citations could have been based on breathalyzer, blood or an officer's sobriety assessment. A major limitation of county-level analyses is that the sample size is small and counties can be heterogeneous in terms of environmental factors and overlook individual neighborhood characteristics. These findings suggest that future analyses with individual level crash data and smaller geographic area detail could be used to address this heterogeneity. Some of the differences in rates near cut points that categorized counties into low, medium and high were small. Another potential limitation is a couple of counties whose nearest hospital is in an adjacent state could contribute to an underestimate of the alcohol-related injury in these counties. However, our analyses that examined and reported proportions of alcohol-related citations to total citations and similarly alcohol-related MV injury compared to total MV injury should not be affected significantly. This study may have missed alcohol-related crashes where injury was minor and did not require medical treatment at an emergency department or hospital or where that medical treatment occurred at an out-of-state hospital. In addition, alcohol-related driving captures only those drivers who were \"caught\" and may underestimate the true incidence of alcohol-impaired driving."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Collectively, these findings suggest the need for further study regarding potentially modifiable factors associated with rural alcohol-related MV injury as well as areas where shifting transportation trends could widen existing alcohol-related MV injury disparities. This study identified higher alcohol-related MV injury risk in less metropolitan areas where travel distances can be longer, alternative transportation choices fewer, and costs for those higher. Of importance, although this study was conducted using data prior to the introduction of ride-hailing services in Long Island and Upstate NY, it suggests that future studies should strive to monitor the possibility that socioeconomic disparities observed in this study could lead to a widening of current disparities in alcohol-related injury in poor rural areas.
