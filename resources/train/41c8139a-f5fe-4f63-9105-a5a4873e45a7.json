Additionally, the levels of functional connectivity within and between brain networks have been associated with cognitive performance in healthy adults. Aiming to explore potential synergistic effects, we investigated the relationship of inter-network functional connectivity, A\u03b2 burden, and memory decline among healthy individuals and individuals with preclinical, prodromal, or clinical Alzheimer's disease.\nIn this longitudinal cohort study (ADNI2), participants (55-88 years) were followed for a maximum of 5 years. We included cognitively healthy participants and patients with mild cognitive impairment (with or without elevated A\u03b2) or Alzheimer's disease. Associations between memory decline, A\u03b2 burden, and connectivity between networks across the groups were investigated using linear and curvilinear mixed-effects models.\nResults: We found a synergistic relationships between inter-network functional connectivity and A\u03b2 burden on memory decline. Dose-response relationships between A\u03b2 and memory decline varied as a function of directionality of internetwork connectivity across groups. When inter-network correlations were negative, the curvilinear mixed-effects models revealed that higher A\u03b2 burden was associated with greater memory decline in cognitively normal participants, but when inter-network correlations were positive, there was no association between the magnitude of A\u03b2 burden and memory decline. Opposite patterns were observed in patients with mild cognitive impairment. Combining negative inter-network correlations with A\u03b2 burden can reduce the required sample size by 88% for clinical trials aiming to slow down memory decline.\nThe direction of inter-network connectivity provides additional information about A\u03b2 burden on the rate of expected memory decline, especially in the preclinical phase.

While A\u03b2 does not relate well to cognition cross-sectionally, it has a dose-response relationship with cognition in healthy adults [7] . However, dementia-related pathologies, including A\u03b2, only explain 41% of variation in cognitive decline [8] and a low signal-to-noise ratio of biomarkers in the asymptomatic stages of the disease for entry criteria in clinical trials has been reported as a reason for trial failure [9] .\nHealthy aging has previously been associated with reduced activity within the default mode network (DMN), a network often associated with memory-related processes such as thinking about the future, episodic memory, and autobiographical memory [10] . Reduced connectivity within the DMN, as measured with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, is also associated with impaired cognitive performance in old age [11] . Additionally, levels of functional connectivity within cognition-related intrinsic brain networks, such as the DMN, and A\u03b2 burden have a synergistic effect on memory decline in clinically normal older individuals [12] . Various networks predict cognitive decline which may indicate that A\u03b2 burden impacts the interaction between networks. Negative correlations between the DMN and task-positive networks has been positively associated with cognitive performance in young individuals [13, 14] . These negative correlation patterns are also referred to as \"anti-correlations\" in the literature and have been described as intrinsically organized antagonistic activation patterns between networks in the brain [15] . These patterns are reported to be part of a mechanism that facilitates cognition, possibly by reinforcing connections between two loci in the brain dedicated to cognitive functions [14, 16] .\nPrevious studies have reported attenuated effects of aging with negative correlations between resting-state networks, with negative correlations further decreasing in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD [17] [18] [19] . While detrimental effects of A\u03b2 on cognition and on functional connectivity within networks have been shown [2, [20] [21] [22] , it remains unknown whether A\u03b2 modulates functional connectivity between networks. Given the close relationship between inter-network connectivity and cognitive decline and these first reported associations with A\u03b2, combining information from inter-network connectivity with A\u03b2 may reduce noise when selecting asymptomatic individuals at risk for AD in clinical trials aimed at slowing down cognitive decline.\nTo that end, we investigated whether functional connectivity between the DMN and task-positive networks predicts memory decline differently among cognitively normal individuals, MCI patients with and without elevated A\u03b2, or AD patients. Additionally, we investigated whether the relationship between inter-network connectivity and memory decline depends on A\u03b2 levels in a dose-response type relationship. We expected that, as the magnitude of negative correlations decreases, memory performance would be lower, and that the strength of these associations would show a dose-response relationship with A\u03b2 burden.

Because of their ability to deal with missing data in longitudinal studies without being subject to complete-case bias [33, 34] , longitudinal analyses were performed with linear and curvilinear mixed-effect regression analyses using maximum likelihood, utilizing nlme version 3.1-128 [35] . Fixed effects were predictor of interest, a random intercept for each participant, and random slope for time. Time was calculated as the number of years since baseline assessment.\nDuring the construction of statistical models, we first investigated effects in the whole sample. In case of a significant effect, the sample was split based on clinical groups and the level of amyloid burden, for which interactive analyses were performed with the cognitively normal group as reference. We also performed within-group analyses to better understand the patterns.

An association was found between functional connectivity between the DMN and FPN and executive functions across the entire sample at baseline. Further analyses of the association between functional connectivity and executive functions within the diagnosis groups reveal an association in the amyloid-negative MCI group (Additional file 1: Table S5 ). Linear mixed-effect models were performed to investigate effects of functional connectivity and group on memory decline over time. The associations between functional connectivity between the networks and time for the whole sample were not significant (Additional file 1: Table S6 ).\nUsing the cognitively normal group as a reference level, a significant three-way interaction effect of time, group, and functional connectivity was found in comparison with the MCI + group for the DMN-DAN and DMN-SN correlations, but not for the DMN-FPN correlations ( Table 2) . Adding inter-network functional connectivity to the models with the covariates contributed significantly to the explained variance of memory decline for the DMN-DAN (R 2 difference = 0.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.07; p = 0.04), but not for the DMN-SN (R 2 difference = 0.001, 95% CI \u22120.001 to 0.01; p = 0.21) or the DMN-FPN (R 2 difference < 0.001, 95% CI \u22120.001 to 0.01; p = 0.48). Figure 1 and Table 2 show significant associations between DMN-DAN and DMN-SN functional connectivity and memory decline between the cognitively normal and MCI + groups. Post-hoc linear mixed models within each group confirmed that, for the cognitively normal group, positive correlations between these network pairs are positively associated with memory performance over time, whereas in the MCI + group positive correlations were negatively associated with memory performance (Additional file 1: Table S7 ). No significant associations were found for executive functions (Additional file 1: Table S8 ).\nAs the cognitively normal group consisted of 11 individuals with A\u03b2 levels above the threshold, we also examined associations between functional inter-network connectivity, A\u03b2 as a continuous variable, and memory decline in the cognitively normal group. These results showed that this interaction was significant for the DMN-DAN and the DMN-SN, but not for the DMN-FPN. This shows that A\u03b2 moderates the association between functional connectivity and memory decline also in the cognitively normal group in such a way that negative correlations were associated with memory decline with elevated A\u03b2 (Table 3 ). Similar findings are observed when grouping cognitively normal individuals based on the A\u03b2 cutoff value (Additional file 1: Table S9 )."}, {"section_title": "Longitudinal curvilinear effects of functional connectivity and amyloid-beta on memory", "text": "Since our linear mixed model results showed opposite moderations by A\u03b2 on the association between functional connectivity and memory performance across the diagnostic groups, we examined curvilinear (quadratic) mixed-effect models for these network interactions using A\u03b2 as a continuous variable to investigate a possible dose-response relationship with memory decline. To ensure that individuals with the highest A\u03b2 levels would not drive associations, we excluded the AD group from these analyses. In the whole sample, excluding the AD group, a quadratic three-way interaction effect of functional connectivity, A\u03b2, and time was found for the DMN-DAN, but marginally not for the DMN-SN correlations (Table 4 ). To visualize this interaction, we plotted simple slopes for different values of 18 F-AV-45 florbetapir standardized uptake value ratio in both groups, broken down by positive and negative inter-network correlations and holding all other fixed effects constant (Fig. 2) . Values for A\u03b2 were chosen to reflect A\u03b2 Figure 2 shows that the dose-response relationship between A\u03b2 and memory decline is modulated by both diagnosis and the direction of DMN-DAN correlations. Within the cognitively normal group, negative DMN-DAN correlations have a curvilinear dose-response relationship with memory decline. However, when networks are positively correlated, we found no significant association between A\u03b2 and memory decline. Conversely, in the MCI group, positive DMN-DAN correlations were associated with a linear dose-response relationship between A\u03b2 and rate of memory. No moderation effects of A\u03b2 were found for the MCI group with negative correlations, although linear effects approached significance (Table 4) .\nPower estimations were performed in the cognitively normal group to investigate the added value of adding functional inter-network connectivity to higher levels of A\u03b2 burden as an inclusion criterion on the required sample size per arm in clinical trials (Fig. 3) . Table 4 Curvilinear associations between functional inter-network connectivity, amyloid-beta burden, and memory decline These results show that selecting cognitively normal participants with higher levels of A\u03b2 burden and who also have a negative DMN-DAN correlation may greatly reduce the sample size needed to detect amyloid-related changes in memory decline in clinical trials as compared with only including preclinical AD individuals or those with positive correlations. For instance, the required sample size per arm to detect an effect size of 0.3 (30%) can be reduced by 88% when using both amyloid and negative inter-network correlations (n = 37) as inclusion criteria in clinical trials towards asymptomatic AD, as opposed to considering only amyloid (n = 318) in the inclusion process.\nWhile functional inter-network connectivity is a relatively affordable and easy measure to collect in participants, this additional requirement can increase the rate of screen failures at inclusion."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This study provides evidence for a dose-response relationship between A\u03b2 burden and inter-network connectivity on memory decline over 4 years in both healthy and patient populations. Previous studies suggested that negative correlations between task-positive and task-negative networks might have a beneficial effect on memory in young individuals [13, 14] . We now show that in older adults these associations depend on disease stage and the burden of A\u03b2. In cognitively normal older individuals, negative correlations were associated with memory decline, and this association became stronger in individuals with higher levels of A\u03b2. Conversely, in patients with MCI, the magnitude of A\u03b2 burden predicted the rate of memory decline associated with positive inter-network correlations. These results suggest that the direction of baseline inter-network connectivity can provide additional information when combined with baseline A\u03b2 burden about the rate of expected memory decline and can add important information to the complexity of factors contributing to cognitive decline. Additionally, these findings can have prognostic implications when using functional connectivity as a potential biomarker and show the importance of including both the direction of inter-network connectivity and A\u03b2 burden for projecting cognitive trajectories as outcome, especially in preclinical AD.\nInterestingly, the associations we observed involved mainly the DMN-DAN correlations. The DMN is one of the most investigated networks and is among the first networks where A\u03b2 accumulates significantly early in the disease [41] . It is therefore likely that other functional networks, especially networks tightly coupled to the DMN, are indirectly susceptible to A\u03b2-related alterations. Animal and electrophysiological studies have provided evidence that A\u03b2 burden leads to synaptic dysfunction and network disorganization [42] .\nWidespread inter-network reorganization under the influence of A\u03b2 have indeed been reported for the coupling between DMN and DAN [43] , DMN and SN [19] , and DMN and FPN [43] , suggesting that topographical closeness to certain hubs, such as the association cortices of the DMN, may put networks at increased risk for A\u03b2 toxicity. Our findings now show that functional implications of the interactions between large-scale brain networks and amyloid in relation to memory decline were mainly observed for the DMN-DAN correlations, with borderline significant associations for the DMN-SN correlations. This is in line with previous research suggesting that an optimal interaction between these specific networks is important for cognitive functioning [13, 14, 44] . The fact that we observed associations between greater positive inter-network correlations and better memory performance over time in clinically normal individuals suggests the presence of compensation mechanisms involving possible reconfiguration of large-scale networks [45, 46] . In the context of preclinical AD, this compensation may provide the architectural basis for maintaining optimal memory performance in old age [45, 47] . These compensation mechanisms may be moderated by cognitive reserve [46] . Individuals with preclinical AD may be able to compensate for AD pathology in the form of positive inter-network correlations. Furthermore, previous studies reported differential connectivity patterns for the anterior versus posterior DMN [48] . Increased within-network functional connectivity in the anterior DMN was associated with higher levels of amyloid pathology in preclinical AD [21] , indicative of regional compensatory mechanisms. However, as the disease progresses, compensatory mechanisms may be dependent on cognitive reserve to stave off memory decline. Attenuated negative correlations between the DMN-DAN may signal impending neuronal breakdown resulting from A\u03b2 toxicity in the prodromal phase, a finding consistent with previous work [46] .\nThe DMN and DAN may operate in a negative correlation pattern to facilitate attention-related processes during cognitive tasks. The DAN is thought to coordinate cross-talk between brain networks, especially during memory tasks. The coordination between brain networks may become especially important in MCI, where medial temporal lobe structures become functionally isolated from other regions or networks. In MCI, a coordinated antiphase functional connection between the DMN and DAN may be fundamental in maintaining optimal levels of memory performance [46] .\nFinally, functional connectivity deteriorates as the disease progresses to more advanced stages [48] . This may partially explain the lack of connectivity-related findings in the AD group, as coherent connectivity patterns between networks may dissipate leaving no association between inter-network connectivity and cognition.\nOur dose-response findings relating A\u03b2 burden to memory decline, depending on functional connectivity status, showed different patterns between cognitively normal individuals and patients with MCI. This has important implications for early detection of individuals at risk of Fig. 3 Power analysis in the cognitively normal group. To assess the effect of including inter-network connectivity as an inclusion criterion in clinical trials, we performed a power analysis in the cognitively normal group. The x axis describes the memory slope reduction in percentages and the y axis describes the number of participants needed per arm to detect this reduction with 80% power and \u03b1 = 0.05 in a 4-year trial with annual assessments. The green line shows the sample size needed when only amyloid is used as an inclusion criterion and inter-network connectivity between the DMN and DAN is not considered. The orange line shows the required sample size when positive inter-network correlations between the DMN and DAN and amyloid are used as inclusion criteria. The blue line shows the required sample size when negative inter-network correlations between the DMN and DAN and amyloid are used as inclusion criteria cognitive decline and the selection of preclinical and prodromal AD individuals for trials using a combination of functional connectivity and A\u03b2. Patients with MCI showed a dose-response relationship between A\u03b2 and memory decline for positive DMN-DAN correlations. In clinically normal individuals, A\u03b2 has a dose-response relationship with memory decline when DMN-DAN correlations are negative. Selecting preclinical AD individuals with positive DMN-DAN correlations could lead to the selection of individuals where individuals with higher levels of A\u03b2 have similar practice effects as individuals with lower levels of A\u03b2 burden. Thus, the direction of inter-network connectivity in combination with A\u03b2 burden can have important implications for participant selection in clinical trials. This notion is further outlined by the results from our power analysis showing that the selection of cognitively normal individuals with elevated A\u03b2 levels and negative inter-network correlations reduced the required sample size by 88% to slow down memory decline by 30%.\nFurthermore, we did not observe independent or synergistic effects of inter-network connectivity or A\u03b2 on cognition in patients with AD in the 2-year follow-up period. This could be related to widespread deposits of both A\u03b2 and tau that may have impacted the integrity of the entire brain. We also did not observe between-group differences in inter-network connectivity of the DMN-DAN at baseline, which is in contrast to previous reports in similar populations [17] [18] [19] . These discrepancies may be related to sample size, methodological differences (regional versus network-based analyses), and the larger age range of the participants in our study.\nInterestingly, the results found in our study seem to be domain-specific for memory. This may be explained by the DMN being specifically associated with memory functions [10, 46] . Since we found the most convincing results in the DMN-DAN correlation, this may emphasize the domain-specific nature of the interaction between DMN-DAN correlation, amyloid burden, and memory decline in preclinical AD."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Due to the observational nature of our study, our data do not allow for any causal inferences between changes in functional connectivity between networks or A\u03b2 deposition. Determining the temporal direction of the three-way association between amyloid, memory decline, and inter-network functional connectivity requires further experimental investigation. Furthermore, longitudinal data of the AD group are limited to a follow-up period of 2 years. This may partially explain the lack of significant results found in this group, although it is also possible that the disease process and associated pathological accumulations are too widespread and may have affected functional networks in multiple ways, all associated with cognitive decline."}, {"section_title": "Future directions", "text": "With the recent development of tau positron emission tomography tracers, future studies can investigate how tau pathology may impact inter-network connectivity since research has suggested a dynamic influence of tau on connectivity within networks, depending on A\u03b2 levels [49] [50] [51] . Results from such a study could ultimately culminate in clinical trials where participants can be chosen using multi-modal selective criteria for memory decline due to AD.\nAdditionally, future studies should investigate whether carriers of the apolipoprotein \u03b54 allele show stonger synergistic effects between AD pathology [52, 53] and inter-network correlations on cognitive decline. Such investigations may further refine the selection criteria for trials and may have implications for determining response to treatment.\nFinally, previous research has shown that AD variants, such as posterior cortical atrophy and early-onset AD, may have unique networks that are preferentially affected in the disease process [54] . Thus, future research may want to investigate how A\u03b2, inter-network correlations, and cognitive decline are associated in these different variants of AD and whether inter-network correlations may be associated with different cognitive domains in these variants."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In conclusion, our results show that the direction of inter-network connectivity provides additional information to baseline A\u03b2 burden about the rate of expected memory decline.
