We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to investigate genetic influences on three important CSF biomarkers (A\u2424 , t-tau, and p-tau 181p ) and 2 ratios (p-tau 181p /A\u2424 and t-tau/A\u2424 ) in the ADNI cohort. We hypothesized that APOE and the adjacent gene, TOMM40, would be strongly associated with CSF biomarkers and sought to discover additional genes that may be related to amyloid and tau pathophysiology in AD and MCI. METHODS Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Data used in this study were obtained from the ADNI database (www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI). ADNI was launched in 2004 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies, and nonprofit organizations, as a $60 million, multiyear public-private partnership. The Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California-San Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many coinvestigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations. ADNI includes more than 800 participants, aged 55 to 90, recruited from over 50 sites across the United States and Canada, including approximately 200 cognitively normal older individuals (i.e., healthy controls) to be followed for 3 years, 400 patients diagnosed with MCI to be followed for 3 years, and 200 patients diagnosed with early AD to be followed for 2 years. Longitudinal imaging, including structural 1.5-T MRI scans collected on the full sample and [ 11 C] PIB and [\n18 F]FDG PET imaging on a subset, and performance on neuropsychological and clinical assessments were collected at baseline and at follow-up visits in 6-to 12-month intervals. Of particular relevance to the present report, APOE and genome-wide genotyping is available on the full ADNI sample and longitudinal CSF markers were obtained for approximately half of the cohort. Further information about ADNI can be found in previous publications 11 and at www.adni-info.org.\nStandard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents. This study was approved by institutional review boards of all participating institutions and written informed consent was obtained from all participants or authorized representatives.\nParticipants. In this study, 374 (AD \u03ed 96, MCI \u03ed 176, healthy controls \u03ed 102 at baseline) non-Hispanic Caucasian individuals from the ADNI cohort whose data met all quality control (QC) criteria were included. The restriction to nonHispanic Caucasian participants served to reduce the likelihood of population stratification effects in the GWAS. Detailed QC steps for CSF 1 and genotype data 12 have been previously reported and are briefly described below.\nCSF measurements and quality control. Baseline CSF samples were obtained from 416 ADNI subjects, enrolled at 56 participating centers using previously reported methods for CSF measurements as described. 1 In summary, baseline CSF samples were obtained in the morning after an overnight fast. Lumbar puncture was performed and CSF was collected into tubes provided to each site, then transferred into polypropylene transfer tubes followed by freezing on dry ice within 1 hour after collection, and shipped overnight to the ADNI Biomarker Core Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center on dry ice. Aliquots (0.5 mL) were prepared from these samples after thawing (1 hour) at room temperature and gentle mixing. The aliquots were stored in bar code-labeled polypropylene vials at \u03ea80\u00b0C.\nAmyloid-\u2424 1-42 peptide (A\u2424 ), total tau (t-tau), and tau phosphorylated at the threonine 181 (p-tau 181p ) were measured using the multiplex xMAP Luminex platform (Luminex Corp, Austin, TX) with Innogenetics (INNO-BIA AlzBio3; Ghent, Belgium; for research use-only reagents) immunoassay kit-based reagents. Among 416 samples, 410 samples passed quality control 1 and an additional subject later failed ADNI screening resulting in 409 valid CSF samples. The demographic, clinical, and APOE genotyping results of these samples were comparable with those of the entire ADNI cohort. 1 Considering the relatively small number of samples for a GWAS, further quality control was performed to reduce the potential influence of extreme outliers on statistical results. Mean and SD of each of the 3 baseline CSF measures and 2 ratios (t-tau/A\u2424 and p-tau 181p /A\u2424 ) were calculated, blind to diagnostic information and subjects who had at least one value greater or smaller than 4 SD from the mean value of each of 5 CSF variables were regarded as extreme outliers and removed from the analysis. This step removed 6 additional participants, resulting in 403 valid CSF samples.\nGenotyping and quality control. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping for more than 620,000 target SNPs was completed on all ADNI participants using the following protocol. 13 A total of 7 mL of blood was taken in EDTAcontaining Vacutainer tubes from all participants and genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Lymphoblastoid cell lines were established by transforming B lymphocytes with Epstein-Barr virus.\n14 Genomic DNA samples were analyzed using the Human 610-Quad BeadChip (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocols (Infinium HD Assay; Super Protocol Guide; rev. A, May 2008). Before initiation of the assay, 50 ng of genomic DNA from each sample was examined qualitatively on a 1% To restrict the present analysis to non-Hispanic Caucasians, these subjects were identified using ethnic and racial information from the clinical database. Among 403 subjects whose CSF sample passed the quality control, explained above, 374 were nonHispanic Caucasian individuals with genotype data.\nStandard QC assessment was performed on these 374 samples using the PLINK software package (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/\u03f3purcell/plink/), release v 1.07, 15 as described previously. 12 Given the smaller size of the current sample (374) as compared to previous analyses, only SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) greater than 20% were retained for analysis. This more stringent threshold was chosen to reduce the likelihood of false-positive results in the context of modest sample size. At the same time, elimination of relatively rare markers reduced the severity of the multiple comparison correction which in turn enhanced statistical power. After the QC procedure, all 374 participants remained in the analysis but only 322,557 out of 620,903 markers, including 2 APOE SNPs (rs429358, rs7412), were considered for analysis. The overall genotyping rate for the remaining dataset was \u054699.5%.\nAPOE genotype is an established risk factor for LOAD. 16 The 2 previously identified APOE SNPs (rs429358, rs7412) that define the \u24402/\u24403/\u24404 alleles important for AD susceptibility were not available on the Illumina array. These SNPs were genotyped by PCR amplification followed by HhaI restriction enzyme digestion and Metaphor Gel and were available in the ADNI database. 17 They were added to ADNI genotype data based on the reported APOE \u24402/\u24403/\u24404 status before the assessment of sample quality. One SNP (rs7412) was removed due to the low MAF (\u03fd20%). Also, APOE \u24404 status was included in the statistical analysis as a dichotomous variable with \u24404-positive classification indicating 1 or 2 \u24404 alleles."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analyses.", "text": "To examine the main effect of each SNP on the 5 CSF biomarkers, a separate GWAS was performed for each of the quantitative CSF variables using PLINK. We tested the additive genetic model, i.e., dose-dependent effect of the minor allele. Baseline age and sex had no significant influence on any of the CSF biomarkers and hence they were not included in the model. APOE \u24404 status was entered as a covariate for analyses of other SNPs. To address the issue of multiple testing, Bonferroni correction was applied and SNPs with corrected p \u03fd 0.01 (uncorrected p \u03fd 3.10 \u03eb 10 \u03ea8 , i.e., 0.01/322,557 markers)\nwere considered genome-wide significant. Manhattan and linkage disequilibrium (LD) plots were generated in Haploview v4.2 (http://www.broadinstitute.org/haploview/haploview) 18 and haplotype blocks were defined by 95% confidence bounds on D\u0408. A block was created if 95% of informative comparisons were in strong LD. 19 Heat maps and hierarchical clustering 12, 20 were employed for visualization of multiple statistical results and selecting important groups of genotypes and phenotypes for further analysis. Table 1 shows the demographic information for the final set of 374 non-Hispanic Caucasian participants and summary statistics for the 5 CSF biomarkers (3 baseline measurements and 2 ratios). The obtained genomic inflation factors 15 of all CSF biomarker associations (between 1.001 and 1.018) indicated low risk of confounding due to population stratification. All 5 CSF biomarkers were different ( p \u03fd 0.05, after Bonferroni correction) across the 3 diagnostic groups. figure 2 . All genome-wide significant SNPs were analyzed further to examine possible interactions between baseline diagnosis and genotypes on associated CSF biomarkers. However, the cell sizes of one or more subgroups, defined by diagnosis and each SNP marker, were small, as indicated in figure 3 . Therefore, no significant interactions were detected. However, the linear trend in mean CSF levels was observed within and across all diagnostic groups for all retained SNPs. Figure 3 shows the mean \u03ee standard error for CSF biomarkers as a function of genotype and baseline diagnosis for the most significant SNP within each identified gene. DISCUSSION A GWAS was performed on 374 ADNI CSF samples to investigate the influence of genetic variation on CSF biomarkers, A\u2424 , t-tau, and p-tau 181p . The use of quantitative traits in GWAS has been shown to have increased power over case-control designs. 21 The use of CSF biomarkers as quantitative traits in this study enabled us to identify a novel AD candidate gene in addition to examining the influence of well-known AD genes on CSF biomarker levels. Four SNPs in the regions of APOE, LOC100129500, TOMM40, and EPC2 showed evidence of genome-wide association with one or more CSF biomarkers. APOE (rs429358) and TOMM40 (rs2075650) are significantly associated with A\u2424 and t-tau/A\u2424 1-42 , but not with t-tau. The significant association of these SNPs with t-tau/A\u2424 1-42 seems to have been driven by A\u2424 . APOE is one of the most robust risk factors for LOAD. 22 The presence of one or more APOE \u24404 alleles was associated with decreased levels of A\u2424 in AD and healthy controls 10 and greater reduction in CSF A\u2424 1-42 levels was observed with increasing number of APOE \u24404 alleles in cognitively normal subjects 23 and in the ADNI cohort."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "1 LOC100129500 is a hypothetical gene that overlaps the APOE and APOC1 genes. rs439401 lies in the intron of this gene (figure e-2) and has been studied for the association with LOAD. 24 TOMM40, adjacent and approximately 15 kb upstream to APOE, was recently identified as a candidate gene for AD 17, 25, 26 and is associated with multiple neuroimaging phenotypes. 12 One exploratory study of healthy subjects without dementia examined the association between CSF apoE levels and SNPs in the region surrounding APOE. 27 Although APOE genotype did not predict CSF apoE level, these authors did find a strong association signal between several TOMM40 SNPs and CSF apoE. The A\u2424 , t-tau, and p-tau 181p CSF biomarkers examined here were not investigated in the previous study 27 or analyzed by GWAS. A novel finding in the present study is the association of EPC2 with t-tau level. EPC2 (enhancer of polycomb homolog 2) belongs to the polycomb protein family and is involved in the formation of heterochromatin. 28 Dysregulation of epigenetic mechanisms and chromatin remodeling may play a role in neurodegenerative and cognitive disorders such as AD.\n29 EPC2 is one of the genes deleted in 2q23.1 microdeletion syndrome leading to severe mental retardation, short stature, and epilepsy and therefore EPC2 may be causally involved in mental retardation. 30 The functional role of EPC2 has not been fully characterized and its association with AD or neurodegeneration has not been previously reported. Although only one EPC2 SNP (rs4499362) reached genome-wide significance, many other SNPs in this region reached the uncorrected p threshold levels of 10 \u03ea6 or 10"}, {"section_title": "\u03ea5", "text": ". All SNPs, highlighted with colored rectangles in figure 3 , are within 3 haplotype blocks (represented by black triangles), encompassing the EPC2 gene. The possible role of this gene in AD pathogenesis warrants detailed investigation.\nIn addition, we found that one SNP (rs7364180) in CCDC134 was associated with A\u2424 1-42 (uncorrected p \u03fd 10 \u03ea6 ). This gene is associated with transcriptional activity of Elk1 and phosphorylation of Erk and JNK/SAPK, 31 but direct association of this gene with AD or neurodegeneration has also not been studied.\nAmong genes listed in table e-1, association of several genes with AD were previously studied, including ABCG2 (ATP-binding cassette, subfamily G [WHITE], member 2), NFATC4 (nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic, calcineurindependent 4), and SREBF2 (sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 2).\n32-34 These genes have not previously been associated with CSF biomarkers. ABCG2 was found upregulated in AD brains and hypothesized as a gatekeeper at the blood-brain barrier for A\u2424 peptide 32 and this gene is expressed in brain endothelial cell blood vessels 35 and the developing human CNS. 36 Morphologic changes occurring around amyloid plaques in AD was studied and it was found that an active form of phosphatase calcineurin and NFATC4 was enriched in the nuclear fraction from the cortex of patients with AD. 33 This gene is expressed in numerous regions in the human brain including the hippocampus 37 and it was reported that neurotrophin-mediated synaptic plasticity played a role in learning and memory. 38 Overexpression of SREBF2 in cortical neurons of transgenic mice was associated with mitochondrial cholesterol accumulation, increasing susceptibility to A\u2424 induced oxidative stress and release of apoptogenic proteins 39 and this gene was previously hypothesized as a genetic factor involved in the pathogenesis of vascular dementia. 40 Although relatively large for a CSF study, a limitation of this report is the modest sample size for a GWAS, which precluded stratified analyses for each diagnostic group or as a function of biomarker results. Hopefully, larger studies in the future will be able to incorporate such analyses. In ADNI-2, all subjects will undergo lumbar punctures for CSF data collection, which will increase statistical power, and participants with early MCI will be included to broaden the sampling of prodromal stages of disease. In addition, RNA will be collected from peripheral blood so that a more dynamic picture of the longitudinal relationship of CSF abnormalities and gene expression should become available. We applied a more stringent MAF threshold (MAF \u03fe 0.20) and a Bonferroni-corrected p value \u03fd 0.01. Due to this, we Figure 3 Mean CSF biomarker levels as a function of baseline diagnosis and genotype\nMean and standard errors of amyloid-\u2424 1-42 peptide (A\u2424 ) and total tau (t-tau) are shown for groups defined by baseline diagnosis and associated single nucleotide polymorphisms reaching genome-wide significance.

AD \u03ed Alzheimer disease; HC \u03ed healthy controls; MCI \u03ed mild cognitive impairment.\nmay have excluded less common SNPs associated with CSF biomarker levels. Another limitation is that although we applied a stringent correction of individual p values for each CSF phenotype, we did not apply a global or family-wise p value correction for all 5 association tests. Since the CSF markers and derived ratios are not independent and the genetic markers are also not independent, we determined that additional Bonferroni corrections would be overly stringent 21 and likely to result in false-negative errors.\nReplication studies with independent, larger samples will be important to confirm these findings. ADNI plans to substantially expand the available sample and to include CSF and DNA collection on all new participants. Future directions also include looking at the interaction of SNP and diagnosis and gene or pathway-based analyses to further investigate associations with CSF biomarker levels. Longitudinal GWAS are also planned with regard to CSF changes and clinical progression. It will be important in future studies to assess if a panel of genetic markers can be combined with CSF analytes to better predict longitudinal outcomes or response to emergent therapeutics.
