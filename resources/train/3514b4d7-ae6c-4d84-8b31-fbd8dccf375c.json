[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Nowadays surface parameterization has been used for a wide variety of applications like pattern recognition and medical imaging. Many prominent approaches, such as conformal mapping [18] and Ricci Flow [20] which have been employed to shape analysis [27, 7] and surface registration [35] . However, an accurate isometric parameterization is impossible for general surfaces.\nThe conformal mapping may bring huge area distortions in certain surfaces, e.g. a slim surface of brain caudate nucleus. In turn, such distortions usually introduce much difficulty for following shape analysis. As the clinical questions of interest move towards identifying very early signs of diseases, the corresponding statistical differences at the group level invariably become weaker and increasingly harder to identify. A stable method to compute some other mapping with alternative invariants may be highly advantageous for visualization and shape analysis in this research area.\nIn this work, we propose a novel method to compute area preserving mapping between surfaces. The mapping is diffeomorphic and unique under normalization. Moreover, the mapping is invariant under isometric transformations. We tested our algorithm on cortical and caudate nucleus surfaces extracted from 3D anatomical brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Figure 1 demonstrates the unique power that the area preserving mapping provides for brain cortical surface visualization when compared with its counterpart conformal mapping result. On cortical surfaces, the area preserving may also provide good visualization function to visualize those deeply buried sulci areas which otherwise are usually visualized with big area distortions. In a classification study, our algorithm achieved 87.50% \u00b1 0.55% average recognition rate with 95% confidence interval in a brain image dataset consisting of images of 50 healthy control (CTL) subjects and 50 Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients.

The results show that conformal mapping has much more area distortions on the areas close to the boundary while the area preserving mapping provides a map which preserves the area everywhere.\nMonge considered the transportation cost for moving a pile of dirt from one spot to the other, then formulated the Optimal Mass Transport problem.

The optimization of energy Eqn.1 is converted to a linear programming problem with n 2 variables.\nIn our current method, we only discretize the target domain \u03a9 1 to n points, then determine n power weights for them, so that the power Voronoi diagram induced by the points and their power weights gives the optimal mass transport map. Furthermore, the n power weights can be obtained by optimizing a convex energy.\nComparing to Kantorovich's approach, Brenier's approach has the following merits from computational point of view:\n1. Complexity: Existing method has n 2 unknowns, whereas ours has only n variables. 2. Uniqueness: Due to the convexity of the energy, our method has a unique solution. 3. Diffeomorphism: If the domains are convex, The optimal mapping is guaranteed to be diffeomorphic. 4. Efficiency: Due to the convexity of the energy, it can be optimized using Newton's method. 5.

The caudate nucleus is a nucleus located within the basal ganglia of human brain. It is an important part of the brain's learning and memory system, for which parametric shape models were developed for tracking shape differences or longitudinal atrophy in diseases, such as Alzheimers Disease [25] and Parkinsons disease [4] , etc.\nFigure 2 (a) shows the triangular mesh of a reconstructed left caudate surface segmented by FIRST. The long and slim surface is challenging to compute its parametric surface. For example, a conformal mapping on slim surface usually introduces area distortions at the exponential level and may cause big numerical problems. In contrast, our method evenly embeds the caudate surface to the parametric domain and keeps the area element unchanged. For implementation, we cut a small hole at the bottom of (a) to get an open boundary to make its topology consistent with a disk's. Figure 2 (b) shows that most parts of conformal mapping result shrink towards the center, while the area preserving method shown in Figure 2 (c) gives a good mapping, keeping the same area element, without much numerical error.

And early researches [30, 13] have demonstrated that surface-based brain mapping may offer advantages over volume-based brain mapping [5] to study structural features of brain, such as cortical gray matter thickness, complexity, and patterns of brain change over time due to disease or developmental process. According to prior AD researches [15, 14] , the brain atrophy is an important biomarker of AD. The atrophy may not only be area shrinkage, but also have anisotropic directions. Therefore, a good shape signature contains both area and angle deformation information may have a good potential to be a practical biomarker.\nIn this work, we proposed to use Beltrami coefficients [16] computed from area preserving mapping result to conformal mapping result, as a shape signature to analyze the human brain cortical surfaces among AD patients and CTL subjects. This kind of signature combines both area and angle information so that it may provide more powerful statistical ability in the AD diagnosis in the early stage.\nData Source: Our data included baseline MRI images from 50 AD patients and 50 healthy control (CTL) subjects (Age: AD: 75.86 \u00b1 7.65; CTL: 74.56 \u00b1 4.16; MMSE score: AD: 22.96 \u00b1 2.15; CTL: 29.02 \u00b1 1.04). We used Freesurfer's automated processing pipeline [13] for automatic skull stripping, tissue classification, cortical surface extraction, vertex correspondences across brain surfaces and cortical parcellations.

Both algorithms compute a diffeomorphism map between the cortical surface and a unit disk. The results show that the conformal mapping results have much more area distortion on the areas close to the boundary while the area preserving mapping provides a map which preserves the area of each individual functional area. The area preserving mapping has a potential to better visualize certain sulci areas which are deeply buried under gyri, and hence to provide a tool for a more accurate manual landmark delineation operation.

The histograms show the norm of Beltrami coefficients of cortical surfaces of AD patients are obviously larger than those of healthy control subjects.
