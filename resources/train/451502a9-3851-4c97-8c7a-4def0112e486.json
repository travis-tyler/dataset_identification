[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "With the general population reaching higher ages, a surge in Alzheimer's disease (AD) incidence will happen in the coming decades, putting a heavy burden on families and healthcare systems Worldwide. This emphasizes the pressing need for AD therapeutic interventions. Accumulating evidence indicates that inflammation is prominent both in the blood and central nervous system of AD sufferers. These data suggest that systemic inflammation plays a crucial role in the cause and effects of AD neuropathology. Capitalizing on our experience from a previous clinical trial with thalidomide, we hypothesize that modulating inflammation via the pleiotropic immunomodulator lenalidomide may alter AD if administered during a proper time window in the course of the disease. Thus, in this Phase II, proof-of mechanism study, 30 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) subjects will be treated with lenalidomide at 10 mg/day for 12 months on a 1:1 ratio, followed by a 6 months washout period. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of lenalidomide on cognition, which is assessed at regular intervals. The secondary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of lenalidomide in aMCI patients evaluated through adverse events, vital signs, clinical biochemistry, and physical and neurological examinations. Tertiary objectives are to analyze the effects of lenalidomide on brain amyloid loads (Florbetapir PET imaging) and neurodegeneration (volumetric MRI) by comparing pre-and post-dosing data."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Currently, there are no FDA-approved medications indicated for the treatment of AD. All monotherapy clinical trials with a focus on disease modification completed to date have failed to meet the clinical endpoint of significantly slowing cognitive decline in dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). This includes trials examining BACE1 inhibitors, 1 \u03b3secretase inhibitors and modulators, 2 and active and passive immunization against monomeric, oligomeric, and protofibril amyloid beta (A\u03b2). 3 Surprisingly, the failure of BACE1 inhibitors in recent clinical trials was associated with an exacerbation of cognitive decline, in addition to displaying toxicities due to the inhibition of not only amyloid precursor protein processing, but also the blocking of processing of all BACE1 substrates. 4 These results emphasize the urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches that reduce several AD neuropathologies simultaneously, without worsening cognition.\nInflammation is prominent in many neurological disorders, yet no clinical trial has demonstrated the efficacy of anti-inflammatory agents for AD. 5, 6 Interestingly, chronic peripheral low-grade inflammation is associated with aging and increases the risk for disease and mortality, including AD. 7 Accumulating evidence indicates that nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukins (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, and IL-6), and chemokines (e.g., IL-8) are elevated both in the blood and central nervous system (CNS) of AD patients. 7 These data strongly suggest that inflammation plays a critical role in the cause and effect of AD neuropathology. 8 Interestingly, the anti-cancer drug lenalidomide is one of the very few pleiotropic agents that not only lowers the expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-8, but also increases the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-10). Thus, lenalidomide modulates both innate and adaptive immune responses. 9 Preliminary tests showed a significant decrease in brain TNF-\u03b1 mRNA, BACE1 mRNA and protein levels, and A\u03b2 plaque loads, as well as improved cognitive measures in APP23 mice administered lenalidomide (unpublished observations; work done under IACUC protocols at Banner Health #1102, at Arizona State University #16-1456R and 19-1669R, and at Cleveland Clinic #2019-2206). Therefore, capitalizing on our experience with a recent thalidomide clinical trial we conducted in house 10 and on our animal observations, in the current project, we aim to test the central hypothesis that lenalidomide reduces inflammatory and AD-associated pathological biomarkers and improves cognition.

The investigator (or qualified designee) will also document his/her review of the EKG printed at the time of evaluation, the final overread EKG, and any alert report.\nPhysical Examination-A complete physical examination, will be performed per Table  1 . An abbreviated physical examination, to include an ophthalmic (routine fundoscopic) examination and routine examination of the heart, lungs, abdomen, skin, and oral cavity will also be performed. Sitting vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature) after each subject sits quietly for 5 mins and body weight will be assessed at the Screening Visit and at each subsequent visit.\nVital Signs-Body temperature (oral or tympanic) will be measured as specified in Table  1 , and as clinically indicated. Blood pressure and pulse rate (PR) will be measured as specified in Table 1 , and as clinically indicated. Blood pressure and PR should be measured after at least 5 mins sitting.\nBody Weight and Height-Body weight and height will be recorded as specified in Table 1 , and as clinically indicated.\nNeurological Examination-A directed neurological examination will be performed by the investigator at the time points specified in Table 1 . Any clinically significant change from baseline on follow-up physical/neurological examinations should be recorded as an AE. If additional amyloid-related imaging abnormalities -edema/effusions, or amyloidrelated imaging abnormalities -hemosiderin deposition are detected, an additional neurological exam may be performed by the investigator.\nTolerability Assessment and Management -Adverse Events-The condition of each study subject will be monitored throughout the study. Signs and symptoms of possible AEs may be observed by the staff, elicited by asking the patient and/or study partner/ informant an open or indirect question (e.g., \"How have you felt since your last clinic visit?\"), or volunteered by the subject and/or study partner. All adverse events, whether observed by the investigator or staff, elicited from the subject or study partner, or volunteered by the subject or study partner will be recorded. Data will include start and end dates, investigator-specified severity and relationship to study drug, and action taken. Whether the event resulted in death, required (or prolonged) hospitalization with persistent or significant disability/incapacity, required intervention to prevent any of the above outcomes, and/or whether it was reported as serious to the medical monitor, DSMB, IRB, and study sponsor will also be recorded.\nKnowledge of a serious adverse event occurring or worsening in a study subject at any time during the trial must be reported by telephone within 24 hrs (if physically possible) to the investigator who will immediately inform the medical monitor, DSMB, and IRB. At any time following the study, the investigator should immediately notify the medical monitor, DSMB, and IRB if he learns of the occurrence of any malignancy or pregnancy involving the participant of this clinical trial, of any serious adverse event that could possibly be related to study drug, or of any congenital anomaly in an offspring of a participant.\nTolerability of lenalidomide in study subjects will be derived from the frequency of AEs and study withdrawal motivated by subjects' discomfort during the dosing period. During visits at the study site, we will collect blood samples and carry out blood counts and comprehensive metabolic panels to monitor hematologic and metabolic toxicities. The results will be shared with neuro-oncologists for expert opinions on whether or not the study subjects suffer lenalidomide-related toxicities. If toxicity is identified, we will follow clinical recommendations published previously, 26 i.e., if platelets fall below 50,000/\u03bcL and/or neutrophils fall below 1,000/\u03bcL, we will interrupt lenalidomide treatment (10 mg initial dose) for a minimum of 7 days. Then, we will confirm that platelets return to \u226550,000/\u03bcL and/or neutrophils return \u22651,000/\u03bcL before re-administering lenalidomide at 5 mg/day for the remaining of the trial. If study subjects continue developing neutropenia and thrombocytopenia under 5 mg/day dosing, the treatment will be stopped, and the patient retested 7 days later. After two successive failures to maintain normal counts of platelets and/or neutrophils under 5 mg/day, the subject will be terminated and recorded as early termination without replacement.\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript or a regional equivalent) designated by the site principal investigator must assess or evaluate the subject for adverse events prior to injection and prior to discharge from the imaging center.

Sequences will include a high resolution 3D T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE) (TE=Min Full, Flip Angle=8, NEX=1, FOV=22, imaging matrix=192\u00d7192, slice thickness=1.2 mm). For clinical safety and secondary measures, a T2 weighted FLAIR image sensitive to strokes and edema, and long TE gradient echo acquisition for microhemorrhage will be performed. Hippocampal, ventricular, and whole brain volumes will be determined by automated segmentation using Freesurfer 6.0. Cortical thicknesses of each brain region are also determined from this automated segmentation. Voxel-wise measures of regional gray matter volumes (corrected for the total intracranial volume) are determined using voxel-based morphometry in SPM12, and the longitudinal whole brain atrophy are estimated using iterative principal component analysis. 27 Furthermore, voxel-wise whole brain morphological changes are determined using deformation-based morphometry with high resolution 3D T1 images as input.\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript plasma C-reactive protein, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 by multiplex ELISA (Meso Scale Discovery platform).\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript\nAuthor Manuscript Cognitive Assessments\nx a\nx b\nx c\nx d\nx c\nx e\nx f\nx g\nConcomitant Meds "}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "This study will adhere to the protocol and ethical principles stated in the most recent version of the Declaration of Helsinki, as well as all applicable federal, state, and local laws, and institutional rules, and regulations.

Its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties have been studied in singledose 15 and chronic 16 administration paradigms. For example, in myeloma patients, C max occurs 0.5-4h post-dose both on days 1 and 28, and area under the concentration is 57% higher than in healthy male volunteers. Multiple dosing does not result in drug accumulation, elimination half-life is 3h, and most of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine within 24 h. 16 In primates, lenalidomide crosses the blood brain barrier (BBB) and is detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with PD properties paralleling those of plasma. 17 However, to our knowledge, no data have been reported in humans.\nDrug dosing is crucial for this clinical trial. Our previous thalidomide trial failed because of too many adverse events (AEs) related to high drug doses. 10 When lenalidomide was licensed initially in 2005, doses of 40 mg/day were typical to treat relapsed multiple myeloma (MM). In the past 5 years, lower doses (10-25 mg/day) have been shown to be similarly effective with a greatly reduced incidence of AEs in MM. 18 While AEs are far from trivial using 15 mg/day in elderly patients with MM, the context of the disease appears to be of fundamental importance. For example, MM toxicities are likely to be problematic at any dose sufficient to be effective in treatment. 19 However, when lenalidomide is used to treat non-hematological malignancies, the risks of cytopenias appear modest and the drug is well tolerated overall. For example, a systematic review of lenalidomide use in prostate cancer showed that grade 3/4 AEs occurred only with doses substantially higher than the range we propose to use in the present study. 20 In addition, and very importantly, the use of lenalidomide has not been studied in healthy subjects for more than one month. Thus, we want to use a dose range known to be effective (5-10 mg/day), but that induces the minimum toxicity possible in non-cancer subjects. Here, safety dictates a fixed dose rather than an escalating dose regimen.\nBased on all these data, and after consulting with neuro-oncologists who have experience prescribing this drug, we propose to administer lenalidomide at 10 mg/day to 15 aMCI patients (and 15 placebo controls). This dose is within the best theoretical range described in clinical pharmacology, which is delimited by the area between the minimum effective dose and minimum toxic dose."}, {"section_title": "Outcome Measures", "text": "The endpoints selected for this study are appropriate measures of treatment effect.

For brain amyloid loads assessment, subjects will undergo 18F-florbetapir imaging on a Siemens Biograph mCT PET/CT scanner. Subjects will receive a single intravenous bolus injection target dose of 370 MBq (10 mCi) of 18F-florbetapir, followed by a saline flush.

This is usually temporary and confined to the lower back. A persistent low-pressure headache may develop after LP, probably due to leakage of CSF. Although the frequencies of post-LP headaches have been reported to be as high as 10% using standard 20 gauge spinal needles, rates of less than 2% have been reported in elderly subjects when atraumatic (Sprotte) needles are used. 28 If a post-LP headache persists, it may need additional treatment, e.g., with fluids and analgesics. Uncommonly, a blood patch (injection of some of the subject's blood to patch the CSF leak) may be needed. Potential, but rare risks of lumbar puncture include infection, damage to nerves in the back, bleeding into the CSF space, and death.

The duration of double-blind treatment within each treatment group and compliance rates will be summarized by descriptive statistics (mean, standard error, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, and sample size) for days of treatment and for total days of exposure, and by the distributions of patients exposed to various durations of treatment categories. Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by descriptive statistics for all patients in each treatment group. Paired data tests will be used to assess eventual biomarker changes between pre-and post-treatment datasets. Measure of associations through bivariate correlations and generalized linear models will be employed to determine the impact of dose-response for lenalidomide on the biomarkers investigated. Missing data will not be imputed and all descriptive summary statistics will be reported based upon the observed data. For limited analyses where formal inferential statistics are needed, likelihood and Bayesian estimates will be employed for subjects missing follow-up assessments. A p<0.05 will be considered statistically significant."}, {"section_title": "Adverse Events.:", "text": "The incidence of all treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) and treatmentrelated AEs will be tabulated by treatment received. These AEs will be classified by system organ class and preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). For incidence reporting, if a subject reported more than one AE that was coded to the same system organ class or preferred term, the subject will be counted only once for that specific system organ class or preferred term. A TEAE is defined as an event that first occurs or worsens in intensity after the administration of study drug. Events recorded between the time the informed consent is signed and the first study drug administration will be listed. An overview of AEs, which includes subject incidence of TEAEs, treatmentrelated AEs, SAEs, deaths, and AEs leading to discontinuation, will be constructed. For AEs presented by severity, the worst severity during the study will be presented for each subject. A summary of values will be examined for significant differences using the appropriate generalized linear model."}, {"section_title": "Serious Adverse Events.:", "text": "All SAEs will be listed and summarized in a similar manner to AEs."}, {"section_title": "Clinical Laboratory Results.:", "text": "Clinical laboratory values will be measured by a central laboratory. Descriptive statistics for actual values and for changes from baseline will be tabulated for laboratory results by scheduled visit. Subjects with clinical laboratory values outside of the normal reference range at any post-baseline assessment will be noted and appropriate binary measures employed. Changes in baseline laboratory values (to worse severity per subject) will be noted so the appropriate test statistics can be used."}, {"section_title": "Electrocardiogram Results.:", "text": "The EKG parameters (heart rate, PR interval, QRS interval, QT interval, and QTc interval) at each time recorded (scheduled for screening and study end), as well as the change from screening will be summarized with descriptive statistics.

For this, all subjects will be assessed by MMSE, CDR, and ADAS-cog 14 at baseline and after dosing to assess whether the drug has a positive effect on cognitive performance. Additional testing will be carried out after 6 months of drug wash out to assess the mid-term effect of the drug on cognition. These factors will be included in a generalized linear mixed model to address their impact. "}, {"section_title": "Aim 2", "text": "Given therapeutic intervention may be given for a long period of time, it is important to assess the safety and tolerability of lenalidomide in aMCI patients. Interestingly, lenalidomide is used for more than 15 years for blood cancer treatment, thus, its adverse events are well documented and consist mainly of neutropenia (20-45%) and thrombocytopenia (30-55%), although its adverse events in non-cancer patients and at lower doses are much less known. All study subjects will be monitored regularly by blood counts during the course of the study. Per clinical recommendation for this drug, subjects showing abnormal blood counts will stop taking lenalidomide until blood counts come back to normal and will resume treatment with 5 mg/day until the following visit. These repeated measures along with the key factors are included in a repeated measures factor analysis with random effects to account for the inherent correlation."}, {"section_title": "Aim 3", "text": "As an exploratory effort to identify surrogate biological markers of treatment efficacy, we will test whether inflammatory and AD-specific markers are altered in aMCI subjects treated with lenalidomide. First, we will compare brain amyloid loads pre-and post-dosing via PET imaging to assess whether the regimen used in this study lowers amyloid burden. Second, we will measure the AD-related CSF markers A\u03b240, A\u03b242, tau, and phospho-tau via multiplex ELISA. Third, we will also measure CSF inflammatory markers, including TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8, by multiplex ELISA. Finally, we will measure plasma inflammatory markers by multiplex ELISA on all samples collected during the study in order to confirm that lenalidomide modulates inflammation in the periphery. The pre-and post-measures, along with the AD and CSF markers, form the systematic component of a generalized linear mixed model used to identify significant drivers."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Alzheimer's disease is a multifactorial and complex neurodegenerative disorder with multiple symptoms and pathophysiological processes developing over time. 29 Consequently, the use of monotherapies with very precise targets is unlikely to slow down or cure the disease. Instead, the use of combination or pleiotropic therapies will likely be more successful to treat the disease. 30 Furthermore, because scientists are currently unable to regenerate brain tissue with of the ability to encode personal memories, the first successful AD therapies will likely be administered at early stages of the disease, i.e., before severe neurodegeneration develops. In the present clinical trial, we will use the pleiotropic immunomodulator lenalidomide on amyloid positive aMCI subjects to assess its potential at slowing down the clinical progression of AD over a year of treatment. Because nothing is known about the study drug in the context of neurological disorders, our first study is a proof of concept trial conducted on a small number of subjects to determine whether lenalidomide could be used as an AD prevention therapy in the future. To reach this goal, we have carefully selected clinically relevant endpoints, including cognitive measures, amyloid brain imaging, and volumetric MRI. Further, we will explore the theragnostic potential of minimally invasive and affordable blood biomarkers to assess treatment efficacy, and we will compare those peripheral markers to clinical markers (i.e. cognitive measures, amyloid imaging, and volumetric MRI). Given the urgent need for therapeutic interventions to prevent the AD pandemic predicted to happen in the coming decades, 31 we strongly believe that repurposing clinically relevant drugs in well-defined pilot studies will dramatically accelerate the discovery of the first effective AD treatments, that will lead to the development of novel interventions, while minimizing toxicity. The present study is designed to obtain accurate data about the repurposing of lenalidomide for AD treatment in the shortest time possible."}]
