There is a long tradition in labor economics estimating the relationship between various is a long tradition in labor economics estimating the relationship between various types of test scores and the earnings of early-career workers (for example, Murnane, types of test scores and the earnings of early-career workers (for example, Murnane, 2 The data requirements for measuring heterogeneity in teaching effectiveness are high. First, one needs longitudinal data on achievement for individual students matched to specifi c teachers. Second, achievement data are needed on an annual basis to be able to track gains for each student over a single school year. (Prior to the No Child Left Behind legislation, many states tested at longer intervals, such as fourth and eighth grade.) Third, panel data on teachers are required as well, to be able to track performance of individual teachers over time. Teacher-level panel data are needed to account for school-level or classroom-level shocks to student achievement that contribute to the measurement error in classroom-level measures. In this journal, Kane and Staiger (2002) showed that conventional estimates of sampling error cannot account for the lack of persistence in school-level value-added estimates. There appear to be other school-level and classroom-level sources of error. 3 Aaronson, Barrow, and Sander (2007) report the variance in teacher quality to be .02 to .06 gradelevel equivalents (adjusted for sampling error). In table 1, they report the standard deviation in grade-level equivalents of eighth grade students to be 1.55 ( \u221a _ .02 /1.55 = .09, \u221a _ .06 /1.55 = .16). Their study adjusted for sampling variation, but not for other classroom level sources of error. Willett, and Levy, 1995; Neal and Johnson, 1996) . Willett, and Levy, 1995; Neal and Johnson, 1996) . 4 4 Kane and Staiger (2002) esti- Kane and Staiger (2002) estimated that the value of a one standard deviation gain in math scores would have mated that the value of a one standard deviation gain in math scores would have been worth $110,000 at age 18 using the Murnane et al. estimates, and $256, 000 been worth $110,000 at age 18 using the Murnane et al. estimates, and $256,000 using the Neal and Johnson results. This implies that a one standard deviation using the Neal and Johnson results. This implies that a one standard deviation increase in teacher effectiveness (that is, one that leads to an increase of about increase in teacher effectiveness (that is, one that leads to an increase of about 0.15 standard deviations of student achievement for 20 students) has a value of 0.15 standard deviations of student achievement for 20 students) has a value of around $330,000 to $760,000. around $330,000 to $760,000.\nAs several recent papers remind us, the statistical assumptions required for the As several recent papers remind us, the statistical assumptions required for the identifi cation of causal teacher effects with observational data are extraordinarily identifi cation of causal teacher effects with observational data are extraordinarily strong and rarely tested (Andrabi, Das, Khwaja, and Zajonc, 2009; McCaffrey, strong and rarely tested (Andrabi, Das, Khwaja, and Zajonc, 2009; McCaffrey, Lockwood, Koretz, Louis, and Hamilton, 2004; Raudenbush, 2004; Rothstein, Lockwood, Koretz, Louis, and Hamilton, 2004; Raudenbush, 2004; Rothstein, 2010; Rubin, Stuart, and Zanutto, 2004; Todd and Wolpin, 2003) .

First, of variation in teacher effects is driven by real differences in teacher quality. First, estimates tend to be highly correlated across a wide variety of specifi cations (Harris estimates tend to be highly correlated across a wide variety of specifi cations (Harris and Sass, 2006) . Second, researchers have consistently found strong correlations and Sass, 2006). Second, researchers have consistently found strong correlations between teacher effect estimates and evaluations made by school principals and between teacher effect estimates and evaluations made by school principals and other professional educators (Murnane, 1975; ; Harris other professional educators (Murnane, 1975; Harris and Sass, 2009; Rockoff and Speroni, 2010; Tyler, Taylor, Kane, and Wooten, 2010). and Sass, 2009; Rockoff and Speroni, 2010; Tyler, Taylor, Kane, and Wooten, 2010) . Third, while most studies of teacher effects rely on assumptions regarding matching Third, while most studies of teacher effects rely on assumptions regarding matching of students with teachers at the classroom level, Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain (2005) of students with teachers at the classroom level, Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain (2005) use a completely different approach that does not rely on this assumption and fi nd use a completely different approach that does not rely on this assumption and fi nd similar estimates to the rest of the literature. similar estimates to the rest of the literature.\nFinally, two studies based on random assignment of teachers to classrooms Finally, two studies based on random assignment of teachers to classrooms have found variation in teacher effects consistent with nonexperimental estimates, have found variation in teacher effects consistent with nonexperimental estimates, suggesting that estimated differences in teacher effectiveness are not driven by suggesting that estimated differences in teacher effectiveness are not driven by student sorting. Nye, Konstantopoulos, and Hedges (2004) reexamined data from student sorting. Nye, Konstantopoulos, and Hedges (2004) reexamined data from the Tennessee STAR classroom size experiment, in which teachers were randomly the Tennessee STAR classroom size experiment, in which teachers were randomly assigned to classes of a given size. The differences in classroom-level student assigned to classes of a given size. The differences in classroom-level student achievement that emerged within given class size groups were larger than would achievement that emerged within given class size groups were larger than would have been expected to occur due to chance and strikingly similar in magnitude to have been expected to occur due to chance and strikingly similar in magnitude to those estimated in nonexperimental studies. Kane and Staiger (2008) study a recent those estimated in nonexperimental studies. Kane and Staiger (2008) study a recent experiment in Los Angeles Unifi ed School District in which pairs of teachers were experiment in Los Angeles Unifi ed School District in which pairs of teachers were 4 Murnane, Willett, and Levy (1995) estimate that a one standard deviation difference in math test performance is associated with an 8 percent hourly wage increase for men and a 12.6 percent increase for women. These estimates may understate the value of academic achievement since the authors also control for years of schooling completed. Neal and Johnson (1996) , who do not condition on educational attainment, estimate that an improvement of one standard deviation in test performance is associated with 18.7 and 25.6 percent increases in hourly wages for men and women, respectively. Of course, the cross-sectional relationship between tested achievement and earnings may overstate the causal value of academic achievement. However, while there have been attempts to estimate the causal value of years of schooling, we are not aware of estimates of the causal value of academic achievement. randomly assigned to classrooms within the same elementary school and grade. randomly assigned to classrooms within the same elementary school and grade. They found that nonexperimental value-added estimates from a pre-experimental They found that nonexperimental value-added estimates from a pre-experimental period were able to predict student achievement differences following random period were able to predict student achievement differences following random assignment: a one-point difference between randomly-assigned teachers in preassignment: a one-point difference between randomly-assigned teachers in preexperimental value added was associated with a one-point difference in student experimental value added was associated with a one-point difference in student achievement following random assignment. Thus, the nonexperimental estimates achievement following random assignment. Thus, the nonexperimental estimates for individual teachers were unbiased predictors of a teacher's impact on student for individual teachers were unbiased predictors of a teacher's impact on student achievement in the experiment. achievement in the experiment. Ideally, estimates of the amount that teachers affect student achievement would Ideally, estimates of the amount that teachers affect student achievement would be the same across classrooms or from year to year within the same teacher, but this be the same across classrooms or from year to year within the same teacher, but this does not hold true in practice. The error in estimates of teacher effects on student does not hold true in practice. The error in estimates of teacher effects on student achievement derives from at least two sources. The fi rst is sampling variation. achievement derives from at least two sources. The fi rst is sampling variation. The typical elementary classroom may have 20 to 25 students per year (although The typical elementary classroom may have 20 to 25 students per year (although middle and high school teachers have somewhat larger classes and typically teach middle and high school teachers have somewhat larger classes and typically teach multiple sections). With samples of such modest size, naturally occurring variation multiple sections). With samples of such modest size, naturally occurring variation in the make-up of a teacher's classroom from year to year will produce variation in the make-up of a teacher's classroom from year to year will produce variation in a teacher's estimated effect. However, volatility in teacher (and school) effects in a teacher's estimated effect. However, volatility in teacher (and school) effects exceeds that predicted by sampling error alone (Kane and Staiger, 2002; exceeds that predicted by sampling error alone (Kane and Staiger, 2002; Kane, Rockoff, and Staiger, 2008) . The source of this second type of error-which can Rockoff, and Staiger, 2008) . The source of this second type of error-which can perhaps more accurately be thought of as nonpersistent variation in estimates of perhaps more accurately be thought of as nonpersistent variation in estimates of teacher effects on student achievement-could include a broad range of factors teacher effects on student achievement-could include a broad range of factors infl uencing the measured achievement gains of groups of students: for example, infl uencing the measured achievement gains of groups of students: for example, interactions between a specifi c teacher's lesson plans and the test used in a given interactions between a specifi c teacher's lesson plans and the test used in a given year, an (unpredictably) disruptive student that drags down his/her classmates, a year, an (unpredictably) disruptive student that drags down his/her classmates, a dog barking in the parking lot on the day of the test, or more mysterious forces that dog barking in the parking lot on the day of the test, or more mysterious forces that fall under the broad category of \"classroom chemistry.\" fall under the broad category of \"classroom chemistry.\"\nFor present purposes, any nonpersistent variation in a teacher's measured For present purposes, any nonpersistent variation in a teacher's measured impact on student achievement represents estimation error. One approach to impact on student achievement represents estimation error. One approach to estimating the proportion of variance due to nonpersistent sources is to study the estimating the proportion of variance due to nonpersistent sources is to study the correlation in estimated impacts across classrooms taught by the same teacher. If correlation in estimated impacts across classrooms taught by the same teacher.

Table 1 reports the standard deviation in estimated teacher effects, the estimated reliability reports the standard deviation in estimated teacher effects, the estimated reliability (as measured by the correlation across classrooms taught by the same teacher), and (as measured by the correlation across classrooms taught by the same teacher), and implied standard deviation in true teacher impacts ( implied standard deviation in true teacher impacts (\u03c3 \u03c3 ) for teachers in two school ) for teachers in two school districts: Los Angeles Unifi ed and New York City. When reported in terms of the districts: Los Angeles Unifi ed and New York City. When reported in terms of the student-level standard deviation in test scores in a given grade and subject, the student-level standard deviation in test scores in a given grade and subject, the standard deviation in estimated value added for teachers was remarkably similar standard deviation in estimated value added for teachers was remarkably similar in the two districts, with estimates in both math and English Language Arts in the in the two districts, with estimates in both math and English Language Arts in the narrow range from .23 to .27. Although the estimated reliability of teacher effects narrow range from .23 to .27. Although the estimated reliability of teacher effects was higher in math than in English Language Arts, and higher in Los Angeles than was higher in math than in English Language Arts, and higher in Los Angeles than in New York City, all the reliability estimates suggest that there is considerable error in New York City, all the reliability estimates suggest that there is considerable error or volatility in the teacher impact estimates. Indeed, more than half of the variation or volatility in the teacher impact estimates. Indeed, more than half of the variation in estimated impacts in math and English Language Arts are nonpersistent. The in estimated impacts in math and English Language Arts are nonpersistent. The standard deviation of the persistent teacher effect is between .12 and .19, similar to standard deviation of the persistent teacher effect is between .12 and .19, similar to that found in the previous literature discussed above. that found in the previous literature discussed above.

This fi nding has been replicated in a number on the job and then fl atten out. This fi nding has been replicated in a number of states and districts (Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain, 2005 ; Clotfelter, Ladd, and of states and districts (Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain, 2005; Clotfelter, Ladd, and Vigdor, 2006; Harris and Sass, 2006; Jacob, 2007) .

However, less than observably similar students assigned to experienced teachers. However, the achievement gains of students assigned to second-year teachers lagged those in the achievement gains of students assigned to second-year teachers lagged those in (2007) carefully studied costs of teacher recruitment and hiring in a large urban Midwestern school district. They estimate total costs and hiring in a large urban Midwestern school district. They estimate total costs of roughly $8,200: recruiting costs per vacancy of $1,100 in central offi ce staff of roughly $8,200: recruiting costs per vacancy of $1,100 in central offi ce staff time and $2,600 in school-level staff time, plus $4,500 for the cost of training time and $2,600 in school-level staff time, plus $4,500 for the cost of training a new teacher. In addition, some of these costs will be defrayed by the salaries a new teacher. In addition, some of these costs will be defrayed by the salaries earned by new teachers, which are typically lower than the salaries of the teachers earned by new teachers, which are typically lower than the salaries of the teachers they replace. they replace.\nBased on the gains that teachers make in their fi rst few years of experience, Based on the gains that teachers make in their fi rst few years of experience, every time a school district loses an experienced teacher with two or more years every time a school district loses an experienced teacher with two or more years of experience and is forced to hire a novice teacher, the students assigned to the of experience and is forced to hire a novice teacher, the students assigned to the novice teacher over the fi rst two years of their career lose roughly .10 standard novice teacher over the fi rst two years of their career lose roughly .10 standard deviations in student achievement. As discussed above, estimates suggest a .10 standeviations in student achievement. As discussed above, estimates suggest a .10 standard deviation gain in math scores has a value of roughly $10,000 to $25,000 per dard deviation gain in math scores has a value of roughly $10,000 to $25,000 per student. Thus, the economic cost of lost academic achievement when replacing an student. Thus, the economic cost of lost academic achievement when replacing an experienced elementary teacher with a novice would be roughly $10,000 to $25,000 experienced elementary teacher with a novice would be roughly $10,000 to $25,000 times 20 students per class-or $200,000 to $500,000. This is obviously a back-oftimes 20 students per class-or $200,000 to $500,000. This is obviously a back-ofthe-envelope calculation, but it dwarfs the direct costs of teacher hiring. the-envelope calculation, but it dwarfs the direct costs of teacher hiring. Reliable screening at the hiring stage would be an effi cient tool for raising Reliable screening at the hiring stage would be an effi cient tool for raising student achievement because it avoids the cost of placing ineffective teachers in student achievement because it avoids the cost of placing ineffective teachers in front of students. Unfortunately, there is scant evidence that school districts or front of students. Unfortunately, there is scant evidence that school districts or principals can effectively separate effective and ineffective teachers when they principals can effectively separate effective and ineffective teachers when they make hiring decisions. Indeed, this notion is supported by the fact that most of make hiring decisions. Indeed, this notion is supported by the fact that most of the variation in teacher effects occurs among teachers hired into the same school. the variation in teacher effects occurs among teachers hired into the same school.\nOne of the most interesting pieces of evidence on this topic comes from a One of the most interesting pieces of evidence on this topic comes from a natural experiment that occurred in California in the late 1990s (Kane and natural experiment that occurred in California in the late 1990s (Kane and Staiger, 2005) . Beginning in the academic year 1996-1997, the state of California Staiger, 2005) . Beginning in the academic year 1996-1997, the state of California provided cash incentives to school districts to keep class sizes in kindergarten provided cash incentives to school districts to keep class sizes in kindergarten through third grade to a maximum of 20 children. To take advantage of the state through third grade to a maximum of 20 children. To take advantage of the state incentive, school districts throughout the state dramatically increased hiring of incentive, school districts throughout the state dramatically increased hiring of new elementary teachers. In the years before 1997, the Los Angeles Unifi ed School new elementary teachers. In the years before 1997, the Los Angeles Unifi ed School District hired 1,200 to 1,400 elementary school teachers per year, but in 1997 Los District hired 1,200 to 1,400 elementary school teachers per year, but in 1997 Los Angeles nearly Angeles nearly tripled the number of elementary school teachers it hired, to 3,335, the number of elementary school teachers it hired, to 3,335, and continued to hire at more than double its earlier level for the next fi ve years. and continued to hire at more than double its earlier level for the next fi ve years.\nIf the district were able to discern teacher effectiveness in the hiring process, If the district were able to discern teacher effectiveness in the hiring process, we would have expected a large increase in hiring to have had a negative effect on we would have expected a large increase in hiring to have had a negative effect on the average effectiveness of the teachers hired. Such an effect would likely have the average effectiveness of the teachers hired. Such an effect would likely have been heightened by the fact that nearly every other school district in California was been heightened by the fact that nearly every other school district in California was on a hiring spree because of the same state law, the fact that teacher compensation on a hiring spree because of the same state law, the fact that teacher compensation in Los Angeles did not increase more than usual during this period, and that the in Los Angeles did not increase more than usual during this period, and that the proportion of new hires in L.A. without teaching credentials rose from 59 percent proportion of new hires in L.A. without teaching credentials rose from 59 percent to 72 percent. to 72 percent.\n5 5 However, Kane and Staiger (2005) fi nd that, despite the size of the However, Kane and Staiger (2005) fi nd that, despite the size of the hiring bubble, value added in the period 2001-2004 for teachers hired in 1997 was hiring bubble, value added in the period 2001-2004 for teachers hired in 1997 was no worse than for teachers hired in the years immediately before 1997. no worse than for teachers hired in the years immediately before 1997.\n6 6 Overall, Overall, there was no evidence that tripling the number of new hires had any effect on their there was no evidence that tripling the number of new hires had any effect on their average effectiveness in the classroom. average effectiveness in the classroom. Other evidence on this issue comes from decades of work in which researchers Other evidence on this issue comes from decades of work in which researchers have tried, unsuccessfully, to link teacher characteristics observable to both have tried, unsuccessfully, to link teacher characteristics observable to both researchers and principals to student outcomes (see reviews by Hanushek, 1986 Hanushek, , 1997  researchers and principals to student outcomes (see reviews by Hanushek, 1986 Hanushek, , 1997 Jacob, 2007) .

With the exception of teaching experience, there is little to suggest that the credentials commonly used to determine teacher certifi cation and pay are that the credentials commonly used to determine teacher certifi cation and pay are related to teachers' impacts on student outcomes.

Some studies fi nd that a teacher's academic background (like college grade point average or SAT test scores) is related academic background (like college grade point average or SAT test scores) is related to student outcomes, but Ballou (1996) fi nds that teaching applicants with strong to student outcomes, but Ballou (1996) fi nds that teaching applicants with strong academic records are no more likely to be hired by school principals. academic records are no more likely to be hired by school principals.\nMore recent work suggests that selecting teaching candidates who are likely More recent work suggests that selecting teaching candidates who are likely to be effective is diffi cult, but not impossible. For example, several studies have to be effective is diffi cult, but not impossible. For example, several studies have estimated the effect of novice teachers recruited under the Teach for America estimated the effect of novice teachers recruited under the Teach for America program (Decker, Mayer, and Glazerman, 2004; Boyd, Grossman, Lankford, Loeb, program (Decker, Mayer, and Glazerman, 2004; Boyd, Grossman, Lankford, Loeb, and Wyckoff, 2006; Kane, Rockoff, and Staiger, 2008) .

Data from the Baccalaureate and Beyond study indicate that roughly one in fi ve college graduates receive teaching certifi cation in the ten years after graduation, but 45 percent of college graduates that obtained teaching certifi cation are not teaching, and 15 percent have never taught (author's calculations using National Center for Education Statistics QuickStats on 6/8/2010). 6 Their analysis focuses on grades two through fi ve in Los Angeles from 2001 through 2004. By 2001, roughly two-thirds of both the 1996 and 1997 hiring cohorts were still employed by the district; thus, there is little evidence to suggest any differential selective attrition for the larger cohort. Also, while their value-added model controls for baseline scores and other student characteristics, there was virtually no difference in the types of students to which the cohorts had been assigned. 7 This evidence runs counter to the prevailing wisdom among some policy analysts that it was a decline in the average quality of the teaching force that accounts for the failure to see an increase in achievement in California resulting from the class size reduction (Bohrnstedt and Stecher, 2002) . points (0.095 standard deviations) higher in math and no higher in reading than points (0.095 standard deviations) higher in math and no higher in reading than those assigned to other teachers.

However, after teachers accept a job, the school which ones will actually succeed. However, after teachers accept a job, the school can observe the gains that students make in test scores. Thus, the principal faces can observe the gains that students make in test scores. Thus, the principal faces a search problem: the principal draws teachers from the applicant pool, observes a search problem: the principal draws teachers from the applicant pool, observes noisy signals over time about teacher productivity, and decides whether to dismiss noisy signals over time about teacher productivity, and decides whether to dismiss unproductive teachers and start the process over again.

The optimal reservation value depends on a set of underlying parameters complex. The optimal reservation value depends on a set of underlying parameters similar to those already discussed: the extent of variation in performance across similar to those already discussed: the extent of variation in performance across teachers, the return to experience, the number of years before tenure, the exogteachers, the return to experience, the number of years before tenure, the exogenous turnover rate, the size of the applicant pool, and the magnitude of other enous turnover rate, the size of the applicant pool, and the magnitude of other hiring and fi ring costs. For example, if teachers are more heterogeneous, then the hiring and fi ring costs. For example, if teachers are more heterogeneous, then the potential benefi ts of greater selection are higher. However, if there is more noise potential benefi ts of greater selection are higher. However, if there is more noise (and thus uncertainty) in the estimates of teacher heterogeneity, then the benefi ts (and thus uncertainty) in the estimates of teacher heterogeneity, then the benefi ts of selection are lower. If the gains from teacher experience are worth more, then of selection are lower. If the gains from teacher experience are worth more, then the cost of dismissing experienced teachers and replacing them with novices is the cost of dismissing experienced teachers and replacing them with novices is larger. If the exogenous turnover rate of teachers is high, then the optimal cut-off larger. If the exogenous turnover rate of teachers is high, then the optimal cut-off for tenure falls because there is less benefi t to giving tenure to highly effective for tenure falls because there is less benefi t to giving tenure to highly effective teachers if they do not stay long. Overall, the principal must set the bar to trade off teachers if they do not stay long.

This aggressive strategy would raise the average value added of teachers in fi rst year. This aggressive strategy would raise the average value added of teachers in the school to just over 0.08; put differently, the effectiveness of the average teacher the school to just over 0.08; put differently, the effectiveness of the average teacher (including the rookies) would be greater than roughly 70 percent of the tenured (including the rookies) would be greater than roughly 70 percent of the tenured teachers under the old system.

Indeed, until the principal from dismissing the very lowest-performing teachers.

While these results are surprising relative to current practice, there are a While these results are surprising relative to current practice, there are a number of clear reasons why principals might choose to dismiss a large proportion number of clear reasons why principals might choose to dismiss a large proportion of novice teachers. Even unreliable performance measures such as value added can of novice teachers. Even unreliable performance measures such as value added can identify substantial and lasting differences across teachers. Differences in teacher identify substantial and lasting differences across teachers. Differences in teacher effects are large and persistent relative to the short-lived costs of hiring a new effects are large and persistent relative to the short-lived costs of hiring a new teacher. Since the typical teacher getting tenure will teach for ten years or more, teacher. Since the typical teacher getting tenure will teach for ten years or more, the benefi t from setting a high tenure bar will be large. Of course, such unrelithe benefi t from setting a high tenure bar will be large. Of course, such unreliable measures make mistakes. But the long-run cost of retaining an ineffective able measures make mistakes. But the long-run cost of retaining an ineffective teacher far outweighs the short-run cost of dismissing an effective teacher. Moreteacher far outweighs the short-run cost of dismissing an effective teacher.

In general, for reasonable variations in the enumerate a number of them here. In general, for reasonable variations in the parameter values, these issues do not alter our qualitative conclusions. parameter values, these issues do not alter our qualitative conclusions.\nFirst, we may have understated the hiring and fi ring costs facing a principal. First, we may have understated the hiring and fi ring costs facing a principal. As we discussed earlier, the main cost of turnover is the lower effectiveness of new As we discussed earlier, the main cost of turnover is the lower effectiveness of new teachers, which corresponds to a cost of well over $100,000 in terms of foregone teachers, which corresponds to a cost of well over $100,000 in terms of foregone future student earnings. However, even if we double the difference in value added future student earnings. However, even if we double the difference in value added between rookies and experienced teachers (that is, from 0.07 to .14 student level between rookies and experienced teachers (that is, from 0.07 to .14 student level standard deviations), the optimal dismissal rate remains over 75 percent. standard deviations), the optimal dismissal rate remains over 75 percent.\nSecond, we may have understated turnover rates among tenured teachers, espeSecond, we may have understated turnover rates among tenured teachers, especially if principals focus on their own school (rather than the district as a whole) cially if principals focus on their own school (rather than the district as a whole) and highly effective teachers are more likely to move to other schools. Similarly, and highly effective teachers are more likely to move to other schools. Similarly, principals may discount the future more highly because of their own likelihood of principals may discount the future more highly because of their own likelihood of leaving the school, or because they believe that teacher effects will not persist into leaving the school, or because they believe that teacher effects will not persist into the future (although the evidence suggests otherwise). However, if we double the the future (although the evidence suggests otherwise). However, if we double the exogenous annual turnover rate from 5 to 10 percent, the optimal dismissal rate exogenous annual turnover rate from 5 to 10 percent, the optimal dismissal rate remains over 70 percent. remains over 70 percent.\nThird, we may have understated the cost of recruiting teachers. The simulation Third, we may have understated the cost of recruiting teachers. The simulation indicates that a dismissal rate of 80 percent would result in more than 20 percent indicates that a dismissal rate of 80 percent would result in more than 20 percent of the workforce being novice teachers at any time, more than double the current of the workforce being novice teachers at any time, more than double the current proportion of novices in Los Angeles and New York City. Districts would have to proportion of novices in Los Angeles and New York City. Districts would have to hire many more teachers to accommodate this strategy, and these new hires would hire many more teachers to accommodate this strategy, and these new hires would presumably demand higher wages to compensate for the substantial risk of being presumably demand higher wages to compensate for the substantial risk of being dismissed. This is particularly true if we continue to require costly up-front teachingdismissed. This is particularly true if we continue to require costly up-front teachingspecifi c training. However, even a doubling of current teacher salaries would not be specifi c training. However, even a doubling of current teacher salaries would not be enough to offset the benefi ts of an aggressive dismissal policy, since a .08 annual enough to offset the benefi ts of an aggressive dismissal policy, since a .08 annual increase in student achievement is worth more than $100,000 per teacher. increase in student achievement is worth more than $100,000 per teacher.\nFourth, our simulations focus on the steady state, and we have ignored what Fourth, our simulations focus on the steady state, and we have ignored what happens along the way. This may be important if we discount the earnings of future happens along the way. This may be important if we discount the earnings of future children relative to current children. Specifi cally, for a school that starts with all children relative to current children. Specifi cally, for a school that starts with all new teachers, an aggressive dismissal policy will result in high fractions of inexpenew teachers, an aggressive dismissal policy will result in high fractions of inexperienced teachers in the short run even if the equilibrium percentage of rookies is rienced teachers in the short run even if the equilibrium percentage of rookies is lower. For example, if we compare a policy of retaining the top 20 percent of new lower. For example, if we compare a policy of retaining the top 20 percent of new teachers with retaining 90 percent, average teacher effectiveness would be slightly teachers with retaining 90 percent, average teacher effectiveness would be slightly lower in the fi rst two years after implementing the more aggressive policy, turn lower in the fi rst two years after implementing the more aggressive policy, turn positive in year three, and approach the steady state gains after roughly ten years. positive in year three, and approach the steady state gains after roughly ten years. Nevertheless, we fi nd the optimal dismissal rate is still above 70 percent for annual Nevertheless, we fi nd the optimal dismissal rate is still above 70 percent for annual discount rates in a reasonable range (say 2 to 8 percent), and falls to 50 percent only discount rates in a reasonable range (say 2 to 8 percent), and falls to 50 percent only with annual discount rates on the order of 15 percent. with annual discount rates on the order of 15 percent.\nFifth, there may be spillover effects in teaching, where good teachers help Fifth, there may be spillover effects in teaching, where good teachers help raise the achievement of their colleagues' students (Jackson and Bruegmann, raise the achievement of their colleagues' students (Jackson and Bruegmann, 2009; Koedell, forthcoming) . This has two offsetting effects in the context of our 2009; Koedell, forthcoming). This has two offsetting effects in the context of our analysis. Spillover effects imply that our estimate of the variation in how teachers analysis. Spillover effects imply that our estimate of the variation in how teachers impact their impact their own students is overstated (because some of the observed effect is due students is overstated (because some of the observed effect is due to their colleagues). However, if this bias is roughly 20 percent, as suggested by to their colleagues). However, if this bias is roughly 20 percent, as suggested by Jackson and Bruegmann (2009) , so that the true standard deviation in persistent Jackson and Bruegmann (2009), so that the true standard deviation in persistent teacher effects was 0.12 rather than 0.15, the optimal dismissal rate would still be 79 teacher effects was 0.12 rather than 0.15, the optimal dismissal rate would still be 79 percent in our model. Moreover, spillover effects will also increase the benefi ts of percent in our model. Moreover, spillover effects will also increase the benefi ts of fi lling schools entirely with highly effective teachers and could easily imply higher fi lling schools entirely with highly effective teachers and could easily imply higher optimal dismissal rates. optimal dismissal rates.\nSixth, we have assumed that teachers who do not receive tenure exit the teaching Sixth, we have assumed that teachers who do not receive tenure exit the teaching workforce. If teaching effectiveness is measured with error and principals have no workforce. If teaching effectiveness is measured with error and principals have no power to screen among candidates, then dismissed teachers could move to another power to screen among candidates, then dismissed teachers could move to another school and hope for better luck in their evaluation. If this occurred, the average quality school and hope for better luck in their evaluation. If this occurred, the average quality of the applicant pool would decline. This type of phenomenon-poorly performing of the applicant pool would decline. This type of phenomenon-poorly performing teachers moving to new schools, typically those serving more disadvantaged students teachers moving to new schools, typically those serving more disadvantaged students (discussed in Boyd, Grossman, Lankford, Loeb, and Wyckoff, 2008)-is already well-(discussed in Boyd, Grossman, Lankford, Loeb, and Wyckoff, 2008)-is already wellknown in education, and is referred to as \"the dance of the lemons.\" This suggests known in education, and is referred to as \"the dance of the lemons.\" This suggests that principals could benefi t their colleagues at other schools by sharing performance that principals could benefi t their colleagues at other schools by sharing performance information on teachers. However, if schools were highly selective in granting tenure, it information on teachers. However, if schools were highly selective in granting tenure, it might also be true that teachers who receive a bad signal regarding their effectiveness might also be true that teachers who receive a bad signal regarding their effectiveness would have less incentive to \"shop around.\" would have less incentive to \"shop around.\" Seventh, there is evidence that the impact of a teacher on the achievement of Seventh, there is evidence that the impact of a teacher on the achievement of current students may fade out over time as those students progress through their current students may fade out over time as those students progress through their remaining years of school (Jacob, Lefgren, and Sims, 2008; remaining years of school (Jacob, Lefgren, and Sims, 2008; Kane and Staiger, 2008) . It is unclear whether this greatly weakens the case for raising teacher quality. 2008). It is unclear whether this greatly weakens the case for raising teacher quality. We do not know whether fadeout is a general phenomenon or whether it is a result We do not know whether fadeout is a general phenomenon or whether it is a result of current levels of heterogeneity in teacher effectiveness. For example, having a of current levels of heterogeneity in teacher effectiveness. For example, having a highly effective teacher in the previous year may do students little good if they are highly effective teacher in the previous year may do students little good if they are placed with a highly ineffective teacher this year, or if their classmates were placed placed with a highly ineffective teacher this year, or if their classmates were placed with a highly ineffective teacher the previous year. In other words, teacher effects with a highly ineffective teacher the previous year. In other words, teacher effects might not fade out if a group of students is given a sequence of highly effective might not fade out if a group of students is given a sequence of highly effective teachers. Moreover, raising a student's academic achievement as measured in a teachers. Moreover, raising a student's academic achievement as measured in a particular grade may still be valuable even if the student's score in later grade levels particular grade may still be valuable even if the student's score in later grade levels do not remain at the improved level. For instance, a better knowledge of numerical do not remain at the improved level. For instance, a better knowledge of numerical operations may still be valuable in the labor market even if it does not lead to better operations may still be valuable in the labor market even if it does not lead to better test scores in algebra. Nevertheless, we do view \"fade-out\" as a primary empirical test scores in algebra. Nevertheless, we do view \"fade-out\" as a primary empirical issue, not just in studies of teachers, but in studies of educational interventions issue, not just in studies of teachers, but in studies of educational interventions more broadly (for example, Currie and Thomas, 1995). more broadly (for example, Currie and Thomas, 1995) .\nFinally, we may have overstated the reliability of value-added measures.

In other words, to avoid unnecessary turnover the principal may choose to wait a year before dismissing a teacher who turnover the principal may choose to wait a year before dismissing a teacher who the principal believes is \"below the bar\" so long as there is a reasonable chance the principal believes is \"below the bar\" so long as there is a reasonable chance that this evaluation could change. Thus, the principal dismisses teachers whose that this evaluation could change. Thus, the principal dismisses teachers whose expected effectiveness lies below a bar that increases with teacher experience. expected effectiveness lies below a bar that increases with teacher experience. Overall dismissal rates do not change much as the principal is allowed to wait until Overall dismissal rates do not change much as the principal is allowed to wait until year 2, 3, or 4 to make a decision, but the extra time allows the principal to better year 2, 3, or 4 to make a decision, but the extra time allows the principal to better identify the remaining subset of teachers for tenure. identify the remaining subset of teachers for tenure.\nIn contrast, In contrast, requiring principals to delay tenure review-that is, removing the principals to delay tenure review-that is, removing the option of dismissal until year 2, 3, or 4-would lead to lower average teacher value option of dismissal until year 2, 3, or 4-would lead to lower average teacher value added, relative to the baseline case.
