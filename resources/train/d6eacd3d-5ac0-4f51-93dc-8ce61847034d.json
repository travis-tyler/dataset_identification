[{"section_title": "", "text": "What is the study about? This study used data from the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS:88) to examine the effects of dual enrollment programs for high school students on college degree attainment. The study further reported on whether the impacts of dual enrollment were different for first generation college students. Dual enrollment programs allow high school students to take college courses and earn college credits while still in high school. The intervention group in the study was comprised of NELS participants who attended a postsecondary school and who participated in a dual enrollment program while in high school (n = 880). The study author used propensity score matching methods to create a comparison group of NELS participants who also attended a postsecondary school but who did not participate in a dual enrollment program in high school (n = 7,920). What did the study report? The study reported that dual enrollment programs significantly increased the likelihood of attaining (a) any college degree and (b) a Bachelor's degree. The study also examined whether dual enrollment programs were effective for first generation college students and whether there were differences in degree attainment for students taking different numbers of dual enrollment courses. These subgroup analyses will be explored more fully in a forthcoming report. "}]
