Downscaled regional climate models, informed by a multimodel ensemble of global climate models provided projections of future climate conditions for Guam. These projected climate conditions provided input to surface-water and groundwater models developed for Guam's hydrology. Guam's water resources in a future climate condition (2080-99) are projected to diminish relative to the recent climate condition. Projected average temperature increases, and average rainfall decreases will lead to reduced streamflow in southern Guam and reduced groundwater recharge to the Northern Guam Lens Aquifer (NGLA). Projected average temperatures in southern Guam will increase about 5.8 \u00b0F (3.22 \u00b0C), overall rainfall will decrease about 7 percent, and streamflow will consequently decrease 18 percent in important areas of southern Guam. Similarly, across the NGLA, future groundwater recharge will be 19 percent less than estimated recharge from 2012. Reduced future streamflow will decrease water availability from the Fena Valley Reservoir; however, the reservoir is expected to be able to supply water at recent demand rates without lowering the reservoir level to the elevation of the water-supply intakes throughout the simulated period of a future climate. A twelveyear simulation indicates that the reservoir can supply about twice the 2018 demand without lowering the reservoir level to the water-supply intakes. By following mitigation strategies to increase reservoir water availability, the withdrawal rate can be increased by 1.7 percent if the water-supply intakes are lowered 5 ft, by 3.5 percent if the spillway height is raised 5 ft, and by 5.3 percent if both strategies are combined.

During the early 1970s to 2010, groundwater withdrawals from the limestone of the Northern Guam Lens Aquifer (NGLA), the main freshwater source on the island, nearly tripled to almost 45 million gallons per day (Mgal/d) (Gingerich, 2013). Because of a proposed military relocation to Guam and expected population growth, freshwater demand on Guam is projected to increase further. Added to this projected demand are the potential adverse climate-change effects to Guam's surface-water and groundwater resources on which U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) installations and the civilian Guam Waterworks Authority (GWA) rely to supply the island's population. Changes in sea level, rainfall, and evapotranspiration, along with changing typhoon frequency and intensity, will affect streamflow, sediment loads, groundwater recharge, and salinity of groundwater withdrawn from wells. A joint U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), University of Hawai\u02bbi, University of Guam, University of Texas, and East-West Center study was undertaken to (1) provide basic understanding about water resources for DoD installations on Guam and (2) assess, on the basis of historic information, sea-level rise predictions, global climate model (GCM) temperature and rainfall output, surface-water models, and a groundwater model, the effect of sea-level rise. This information is needed to develop climate-change adaptation plans for DoD infrastructure and associated water resources, as well as to develop adequate response strategies by providing the range of parameters under which infrastructure and freshwater supplies may realistically be threatened. As part of meeting study objectives, the availability of accessible information to local stakeholders interested in Guam's water resources was prioritized.

In southern Guam, an updated bathymetric survey of the Fena Valley Reservoir provided data for improved stage-capacity and reservoir sedimentation models. A rainfall-runoff watershed model, calibrated to historic conditions, provided estimates of streamflow under projected future hydrologic conditions. These two surface-water models were then used together to project reservoir storage conditions under a variety of future surface-water withdrawal scenarios. In northern Guam, a water-budget model, using projected climate as input, provided estimates of future groundwater recharge supplying Guam's limestone aquifer.

The island's southern province consists primarily of rugged volcanic uplands and gently sloping foothills that have been cut by streams creating a surface-water dominated hydrographic setting (Tracey and others, 1964;Gingerich, 2003). The island's northern province is a broad limestone plateau bordered by steep cliffs and discontinuous coastal lowlands. Most of the plateau lacks stream channels, but it has many closed depressions and is a groundwaterdominated hydrographic setting underlain by the NGLA (Ward and others, 1965;Gingerich, 2003, Gingerich, 2013."}, {"section_title": "Surface-Water Resources in Southern Guam", "text": "The Fena Valley Reservoir (FVR) ( fig. 1) is the DoD's primary water source for Naval Base Guam and the nearby civilian residents in villages near the base (Marineau and Wright, 2015).

The water-supply intake is about 45 ft below the dam's spillway. The FVR receives streamflow from the 5.89 mi 2 Fena Valley watershed ( fig.1), which includes three gaged rivers, (Maulap, Almagosa [including inflow from Almagosa Springs], and Imong) and one ungaged area. The amount of water supplied from the Fena Valley watershed is estimated to have ranged from 3.7 to 13.5 Mgal/d and averaged 9.2 Mgal/d during 1990-2014 but averaged only 5.5 Mgal/d during 2010-14, because of reductions in water supplied by Almagosa Springs (at the time of publication, water-supply data had not been published by the U.S. Navy).

Here, the water table is no more than six feet (1.8 meters) above sea level, and the hydraulic gradient is nearly flat. The \"basal\" freshwater lens in these limestone rocks is relatively thin and is underlain by the saline water of the transition zone and further underlain by saltwater ( fig. 2). The \"para-basal\" freshwater lens extends downward from the limestone into the low-permeability volcanic rocks underneath. This part of the freshwater lens is the prime target for groundwater development because it is less vulnerable to saltwater intrusion from below. The geologically young, eogenetic limestone of northern Guam generally has extremely high permeability (Ward and others, 1965;Vacher and Mylroie, 2002). Faults transecting the plateau complicate the structure and regional permeability distribution of the aquifer (Mylroie and others, 2001;Jenson and others, 2006). In modeling studies, the regional horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the main limestone aquifer generally is estimated to be thousands of feet per day (Contractor and Srivastava, 1990;Jocson and others, 1999;Jenson, 2000, Gingerich, 2013). Recharge was estimated to be about 238 Mgal/d for the collective area of the six aquifer systems in northern Guam that represents the general area underlain by the NGLA (Johnson, 2012). Ninety-seven percent of recharge is from rainfall and the remainder is from irrigation, leaky water mains, and septic systems.

Results demonstrate the highly skewed nature of daily sediment deposition such that intense typhoondriven runoff events can contribute sediment volumes capable of reducing the overall reservoir capacity by as much as 3 percent in a few days ( fig. 7).

Projecting hydro-climate conditions for the end of the current century is known to be associated with uncertainties. To reduce uncertainties, a subset of five well-performing GCMs (from a pool of 41) were selected (the process is described below) that best represent present-day rainfall and seasonal temperature climatologies and their annual cycle, as well as the relationship between the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and rainfall at interannual timescales. This selection is based on the assumption that models that best represent the recent  climate and its variation are expected to provide a robust estimate of future climate and thereby reduce uncertainty. The regional-model experimental design warrants that only the current ENSO and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) conditions are maintained and assumes no changes to these variabilities in the future (a limitation of this pseudo-warming experimental design). A pseudo-warming experimental design is conducted by using a constant lateral boundary condition and adding the future change in the atmospheric field of a GCM to objective analysis data (Kimura and Kitoh, 2007). However, a focus on the longterm changes (trend) in climate variables is preserved. This 20-year (yr) multimodel formulation is preferred because it accounts for projected end-of-century climate trends caused by changes in radiative forcing and reduces the variability introduced by using just one global climate model. All of the available CMIP5 GCM historical simulations (table 1) were assessed on the basis of how well each model's simulated variables (for example rainfall, temperature) matched historical observations of the mean climatology over the tropical Pacific, annual climate cycle around islands near the monsoon trough (including Guam), and interannual teleconnections inferred from linear regressions of tropical Pacific-wide fields onto sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the Ni\u00f1o 3.4 region (5\u00b0N-5\u00b0S, 170\u00b0W-120\u00b0W). All GCMs were ranked by their temporal and spatial correlations, root mean square errors, and Taylor skill scores (Taylor, 2001). Five well-performing GCMs were selected from this ranking (highlighted in red in table 1).

For the recent and future periods, the daily water-budget model and model inputs (soil and land-cover conditions, irrigation, septic leachate, and water-main leakage) were the same that Johnson (2012) previously used to compute recharge for the 1961-2005 period on Guam. Other model inputs (rainfall, runoff, and reference evapotranspiration) for the recent period were derived from historic records on Guam. For the future recharge, these three inputs were estimated from the future climate projections as detailed in appendix 1."}, {"section_title": "Estimating Future Groundwater Salinity", "text": "An existing numerical groundwater model of the NGLA (Gingerich, 2013) was used to simulate freshwater-lens conditions in a future climate with lower recharge, higher sea level than present, and various groundwater withdrawal scenarios (model data files available in Gingerich, 2019). Guam's coastline, under sea-level-rise conditions evaluated, was reduced on the basis of island topography and modeled by increasing the number of onshore pressure nodes that represent the new and higher sea level in projected inundated areas. Additionally, the specified pressures of the offshore nodes were increased to represent the appropriate seawater depth. Simulations of future conditions (except those evaluating just an increase in sea level) used the spatially distributed estimate of mean annual recharge to the NGLA for 2080-2099. Changes in simulated chloride concentrations at Guam's production wells were evaluated for the different model scenarios. As was described in Gingerich (2013), simulated equivalent chloride concentrations were converted from simulated salinity values in the SUTRA output by dividing the salinity value (expressed as a percentage of seawater) by 100 and multiplying the result by the assumed seawater chloride concentration (19,600 mg/L). Simulated salinity values are a flow-weighted average of all nodes representing the well. The volume-weighted chloride concentration of water produced from the entire set of production wells used in each scenario was calculated using: (1) where C ave is the volume-weighted chloride concentration of all production wells [mg/L], pw is the number of production wells, C is simulated chloride concentration at production well n, [mg/L], and, R is the withdrawal rate of production well n. [cubic liters per unit of time (L 3 /T)] This volume-weighted chloride concentration (or composite concentration) represents an overall average concentration in which all the produced water is blended to create a uniform concentration for distribution. Individual production wells were also grouped into three categories: threatened (> 500 mg/L chloride), cautionary (200-500 mg/L chloride), or acceptable (< 200 mg/L chloride) based on the simulated chloride concentration of pumped water (after Gingerich, 2013). Maps showing changes in simulated concentrations and concentration categories were compared to evaluate the model scenarios."}, {"section_title": "Results and Discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Future Rainfall and Temperature", "text": "Simulated rainfall across the western Pacific Ocean during the historical period  and future projections of rainfall change for 2069-89 can be compared for the five well-performing GCMs (fig. 12). The results for boreal summer (June through August) season are shown in the left panel and those for the winter (December through February) season are shown in the right panel. In contrast to SST projections, where the entire tropical Pacific Ocean region is expected to experience increased temperature, rainfall projections indicate a mixed response. During summer and winter seasons, the CMIP5 GCMs project an overall increase in rainfall this century along the equatorial and tropical northwestern regions of the Pacific Ocean near Guam. The projected rainfall increase is larger during the summer (wet) season. During future winter (dry) seasons, the projection shows a narrow east-west stretching zonal band of decreased rainfall that extends from south of Guam to the equator. Based on modeled rainfall estimates from the RCP8.5 scenario for Guam (Zhang, 2016), Guam's annual rainfall in a future climate (2080-99) is projected to be about 94 percent of recent (1990)(1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009) rainfall ( fig. 13A). Drought-like conditions (defined here as more than 20 percent below mean annual historic rainfall) will occur more frequently. Records of rainfall measured at the Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport ( fig. 1) (available at https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov) indicate that, during a recent 50-year period (1966-2015), annual rainfall was more than 20 percent below recent (1990-2009) rainfall only 16 percent of the time. In comparison, future rainfall that is based on downscaled climate models, will be at least 20 percent below recent rainfall 40 percent of the time. In other words, Guam is projected to experience drought-like rainfall conditions 4 years out of every 10, whereas historically, drought-like conditions occurred about 1.6 years out of every 10. Future rainfall projections indicate a decline (relative to 1990-2009 observed conditions) in overall rainfall of about 7 percent in the modeled regions of southern Guam (Rosa and Hay, 2017a). Rainfall decreases by about 12 percent during the wet season (July through December) and increases by about 9 percent during the dry season (January through June). Future temperature projections indicate an average 3.2 \u00b0C (5.8 \u00b0F) increase in daily temperature for the collective area of the modeled regions in southern Guam. As a result, about 2.4 times as many days in the future-climate scenarios will have average maximum air temperatures over 32.2 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) in the modeled regions of southern Guam (Rosa and Hay, 2017a). In the twelve years of modeled future climate (the shortened period modeled because of missing data), the number of days over 32.2 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) increased in the range of 115-257 days per year depending on the years modeled.   Simulated change in rainfall, in percent Temperature, in degrees Celsius Projections of future-climate variables using the downscaled local climate model show an overall decrease in rainfall amounts, whereas the CMIP5 GCM results indicate a wetter climate for the region. However, downscaled local climate model results showing drier conditions were used in this study to project future streamflow and recharge conditions and are considered more reliable because local orographic conditions for Guam are included in the analysis. Tropical cyclone genesis counts (per year) are similar between historical data, also referred to as reanalysis products, (78 observed storms; fig. 14A) and high-resolution atmospheric model integration (72 simulated storms; fig. 14B). Similarly, the tropical cyclone track assessed from the objective algorithm indicates that the high-resolution model captures the overall tracks obtained from the reanalysis products ( fig. 14C and 14D). From these analyses, the TRACK algorithm successfully detects tropical cyclones in the reanalysis and climate models, although there are biases in CMIP5, such as too many tropical storms in the central Pacific Ocean and not enough typhoons in the northwestern Pacific Ocean (for example near Guam). To address such spatially dependent biases, climate-change projections are presented either as the difference between future and historical simulations or by scaling the occurrence of tropical cyclones around island regions so that the mean of the historical period matches that of observations (Widlansky and others, 2018). Furthermore, for all future change analyses, the signal-to-noise ratio was maximized by considering the high future greenhouse-gas concentration scenario (RCP8.5) and also by calculating the multimodel mean. Greenhouse warming produces an overall decrease this century in the number of tropical storms and typhoons likely affecting Guam (20-30 percent decrease; multimodel average; Widlansky and others, 2018) ( fig. 15), although year-to-year variability in storm occurrence is projected to continue with variations in the tropical circulation and atmospheric moisture necessary for tropical cyclone genesis (Camargo and others, 2007;Gray, 1979). However, an above-average typhoon year in the future will still be more active than the historical average. No significant increase in the interannual occurrence of tropical cyclones by the end of the 21st century was found ( fig. 15); in fact, the range of likely number of"}, {"section_title": "TC genesis (AMIP high-resolution) TC genesis (reanalysis)", "text": "A B"}, {"section_title": "D C", "text": "TC tracks (AMIP high-resolution) TC tracks (reanalysis) 180\u00b0 W 140\u00b0 W 100\u00b0 W 60\u00b0 W 1 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 storms decreased slightly for Guam (Widlansky and others, 2018). A possibility of enhanced ENSO-related tropical cyclone interannual variability remains, because some climate-change experiments suggest that the atmospheric environment during future El Ni\u00f1o events will be more conducive for storm genesis (Chand and others, 2017). Yet, at least for the models considered, any future increases in year-to-year variability seem to be overwhelmed by mean state changes (less tropical cyclones). Averaging over future years, in contrast, Widlansky and others (2018) found pronounced long-term changes that are mostly consistent with other studies. The majority of the most realistic climate models from CMIP5 project that the overall tropical cyclone occurrence southeast of Guam will decrease with greenhouse warming ( fig. 16A) as less moisture rises to the layer of the atmosphere where convection is strongest. Decreased tropical cyclone numbers are likely a manifestation of the expected future weakening of tropical circulation (Knutson and others, 2010). Although decreased numbers of tropical cyclones are projected, the same models project that the tropical cyclones that occur are likely to be stronger, especially in the northcentral Pacific Ocean where directly simulated maximum intensity also increases ( fig. 16B). This is because higher SSTs provide more thermodynamic energy to convert to wind (Emanuel, 1999).   ; blue line), and the future (RCP8.5; orange line) climate with greenhouse warming (2071-2100) around Guam (modified from Widlansky and others, 2018).

The range of storm counts expected during about 68 percent of years is in parentheses (\u00b11 standard deviation from the mean). Simulations are scaled to remove model biases in storm genesis and tracks. Tropical cyclones per year Probablility of occurrence, in percent enesis potential index The decrease in the mean number of tropical cyclones projected to affect Guam with continued greenhouse warming is consistent with expected future weakening of the tropical circulation and a decrease globally in the number of storms forming (Christensen and others, 2013). Less vertical lift and a drying middle part of the troposphere, which has been shown to limit tropical cyclone genesis (Knutson and others, 2010), are noted in the future-climate model simulations. Whereas future higher SST and a more unstable atmosphere are consistent with more intense typhoons (for example Emanuel, 1995), future intensity changes cannot be directly assessed using coarseresolution (greater than 100 km [62 mi]) GCMs because they do not simulate well the strongest typhoons."}, {"section_title": "Projected Impacts on Surface-Water Resources", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Streamflow Under Future Conditions", "text": "Streamflow is projected, for the twelve modeled regions, to decrease by 12 to 36 percent in a future climate relative to streamflow in the historic period as modeled by the PRMS_2016 model.

Projected streamflow declines in the individual HRUs range from 2 to 78 percent (fig. 17); PRMS_2016 estimates that for the domain of the PRMS_2016 model, total streamflow for the time periods evaluated will be about 18 percent less. Streamflow decreases are due to decreased future rainfall and increased actual evapotranspiration. Increases in future minimum and maximum temperatures will cause as much as a 29-percent increase in actual evapotranspiration in the modeled regions."}, {"section_title": "Fena Valley Reservoir Storage Under Future Conditions", "text": "Future FVR water levels were estimated on the basis of future climate conditions for a range of constant water-withdrawal rates (5.0 to 11.0 Mgal/d) using multiple FVR_2016 model simulations (table 3; fig. 18). The withdrawal rates simulated are about 1 to 2 times the average withdrawal rate (5.5 Mgal/d) during 2010-14 and cover the range of water-supply rates used to meet demand in the area that receives FVR water. This time period represents the last five years of accessible withdrawal data and is the most representative time period to summarize recent demand. Expected future demand is unknown, but the pumping range evaluated in the scenarios is greater than any expected potential increase. These simulations assume constant reservoir storage capacity to apply the reservoir stage-storage capacity curves (Marineau and Wright, 2015) in the FVR_2016 model and assume that the initial water level of the reservoir was at capacity. The simulated FVR water levels are compared with conservation levels I to V where level I is the most restrictive and level V is the least restrictive (Naval Base Guam, 2012).   Results indicate that under future climate conditions, FVR water levels remain in level V most of the time at the lowest rate (5 Mgal/d) but fall into level IV for one month during the 12-year simulation. At the highest rate (11 Mgal/d), FVR water levels fall into level IV 67 percent of the time, into level III 41 percent of the time, and into level II 15 percent of the time (table 3; fig. 18). Although the FVR water levels fall into level I for one month, they always remain at least 12.5 ft above the level of the pump intakes. In comparison, simulations for the historic (1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009) climate period and the lowest withdrawal rate indicate that FVR water levels remain at level V for the entire simulation. At the highest rate, FVR water levels fall into level IV 46 percent of the time, into level III 17 percent of the time, and into level II 3 percent of the time (table 3; fig. 18). For the lowest withdrawal rate considered (which is most similar to the 2010-14 withdrawal rate of 5.5 Mgal/d), model results indicate that FVR water levels are in level IV for one month more during future conditions relative to historic conditions. A trial-and-error procedure using the FVR_2016 model indicated that a maximum withdrawal rate of 11.4 Mgal/d would maintain water levels above the pump intake elevation (shown as 45 ft below the dam spillway in Kennedy Engineers, Inc., 1974) for 12 years of the future climate conditions. Two-year drought simulations were run using the minimum annual rainfall from the 12-year future climate (year 2088) for two years back-to-back to simulate an extended period of drought and a range of water-withdrawal rates. At sustained water-withdrawal rates less than 9 Mgal/d, progressively more serious conservation levels are reached, but the reservoir still recovers after the dry season with water levels returning to the elevation of the spillway at the end of the two-year drought (table 3; fig. 18). However, simulating sustained pumping at the highest water-withdrawal rate (11 Mgal/d) during the projected two-year drought shows that the reservoir will not recover after the dry season and the water level decreases to the elevation of the pump intake after 20 months in the 24-month period simulated."}, {"section_title": "Fena Valley Reservoir Sedimentation Under Future Conditions", "text": "Results of FVR-sedimentation-model simulations, using future streamflow conditions for the FVR, indicate that the future sediment load discharged into the reservoir will decrease by about 32 percent relative to the modeled sediment load for the historic period because of the decrease in streamflow. At this estimated future sediment load, the reservoir will lose about 0.46 percent/yr of its storage capacity in the future compared with 0.68 percent/ yr during 1951-2014. However, because historically about 81 percent of the total sediment load to the FVR was generated from the five largest daily streamflow events (Marineau and Wright, 2017); the future sedimentation rate depends on the occurrence of the rarest but most intense storms. The projection of less frequent but stronger tropical cyclones near Guam for the RCP 8.5 scenario (Widlansky and others, 2018) would suggest that the sediment load discharged into the FVR could increase due to the increased intensity of these rare storms. Currently available climate models of future conditions are not able to accurately predict rainfall intensity for any particular storm; therefore, accurately quantifying how future typhoons could increase the sedimentation rates is not possible."}, {"section_title": "Mitigation Strategies for Increasing Future Surface-Water Availability", "text": "Several possible strategies that increase FVR water availability in a future climate with less stream discharge into FVR were evaluated by applying the 2088-99 streamflow estimates from the PRMS_2016 model.

Kennedy Engineers, Inc. (1974) investigated the possibility of increasing the spillway height by as much as 40 ft but only considered the implications to the dam infrastructure and did not estimate the increased reservoir capacity. Estimates of increased FVR capacity for a 5-ft spillway elevation increase, using an extension of the 2015 stage capacity curve (Marineau and Wright, 2015) and a 2013 aerial Light Detection and Range (LiDAR) survey (U.S. Geological Survey and others, 2015) to estimate the topography above the spillway elevation around the reservoir, indicate that capacity increases of 14-15 percent could be expected (see appendix 2). The extended stage capacity curve (appendix 2) was also incorporated into the FVR_2016 model to simulate increasing the FVR spillway elevation by 5 ft. FVR_2016 model simulations indicate that a constant withdrawal rate of 11.8 Mgal/d could be maintained during 12 years of the future climate conditions without lowering the water level to the water-supply intake during any of the driest periods. This results in an increased withdrawal rate of 3.5 percent compared to a simulation with future climate and the existing spillway configuration. The relatively small increase in available withdrawal despite the larger increase in reservoir capacity is because the amount of streamflow during each year of the 12-year simulation is not sufficient to fill the reservoir to the added capacity gained by raising the spillway. Therefore, the total annual withdrawal rate is limited not by the capacity of the reservoir, but by the projected amount of streamflow available to fill the reservoir."}, {"section_title": "Lowering FVR Water-Supply Intake Elevation and Increasing FVR Spillway Height", "text": "This strategy is a combination of the previous two strategies; lowering the intake elevation by 5 ft and increasing the spillway height by 5 ft.

For just the part of the island underlain by the NGLA, mean annual recharge for the future period was estimated to be 193 Mgal/d, also 15 percent less than that estimated for the 1990-2009 period, and 19 percent less than that estimated by Johnson (2012) for the 1961-2005 period ( fig. 19).

Wells impacted the most by increased sea level are those completed deeper into the aquifer and with open intervals closer to the transition zone between freshwater and saltwater in the aquifer.

Calibration and verification were done for a specific time period and range of streamflow or groundwater conditions; therefore, it is uncertain how the models will perform under different conditions. The accuracy of groundwater recharge estimated using the water-budget model is limited by the quality and availability of data needed to develop model input-land cover, rainfall, irrigation, runoff, soil properties, and evapotranspiration. Initiation of and continued research to characterize these parameters would improve overall confidence in recharge estimates. The primary limitations of the Fena Valley reservoir sedimentation model are related to the use of a stable relation between discharge and sediment load. This relation can change over long timescales (for example, watershed land use changes) and short timescales (for example, limited sediment supply during individual flood events and seasonal changes). However, because of its simplicity and easy application with daily discharge data, which is often available, the stable dischargesediment load relationship provides an attractive alternative to develop a first-order estimate of the daily variability in reservoir deposition rates in a data-sparse environment. The projections of future water-resource conditions are, of course, limited by the uncertainty in the estimates of future climate. The estimates of future climate are based on an averaging of global climate models that all contain inherent uncertainty. The assumption is that the selected models that \"best\" represent the recent climate and its variation are expected to provide a robust estimate of future climate, and thereby reduce uncertainty. Combining output from global climate models and dynamical and statistical downscaling models using advanced averaging, weighting, and pattern scaling approaches can result in more relevant and robust future projections (Hayhoe and others, 2017). The regional-model experimental design warrants that only the current ENSO and PDO conditions are maintained and assumes no changes to these variabilities in the future (a limitation of this pseudowarming experimental design). A focus on the long-term trend in climate variables is preserved; however, changes in future ENSO or PDO conditions could produce different results than are projected here. Furthermore, the RCP8.5 radiative forcing scenario reflects the upper range of the open literature on carbon emissions, but it is not intended to serve as an upper limit on possible emissions nor as a reference scenario for other scenarios of less radiative forcing. Within the RCP family, individual scenarios have not been assigned a formal likelihood (Hayhoe and others, 2017). Likewise, the results presented in this study, which are based on the RCP8.5 scenario, are not assigned a likelihood of occurring."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Guam's water resources in a future climate condition (2080-99) are projected to diminish relative to the recent climate condition. Future average temperature increases, and average rainfall decreases will lead to reduced streamflow in southern Guam and reduced groundwater recharge to the Northern Guam Lens Aquifer (NGLA). In the projected future climate, average temperatures in southern Guam will increase about 3.2 \u00b0C (5.8 \u00b0F), overall rainfall will decrease about 7 percent, and, streamflow will consequently decrease 18 percent in parts of southern Guam. Similarly, across the NGLA, future groundwater recharge will be 19 percent less than average estimated recharge during 1961-2005. Reduced future streamflow will decrease water availability from the Fena Valley Reservoir (FVR). Withdrawal rates representative of recent (2010-14) demand will lead to one more month in conservation level IV (the second least-restrictive level), during future climate conditions. However, the FVR is expected to be able to supply water at recent demand rates without lowering the reservoir level to the elevation of the water-supply intakes throughout the simulated period with a future climate. Simulations with increased withdrawal rates in a future climate indicate that the maximum rate the FVR can supply over the 12-year simulation without lowering the reservoir level to the intakes is 11.4 Mgal/d, about twice the recent demand. The evaluated mitigation strategies to increase FVR water availability in a future climate with less streamflow were lowering the water-supply intakes, increasing the spillway height, and a combination of both. Each of these strategies allow a higher constant withdrawal rate from FVR (with the constraint of keeping the reservoir level just above the elevation of the water-supply intake), when compared with the rate allowed in a future climate with the same constraint but without modifying the intake elevation or spillway height. Specifically, the constant withdrawal rate can be increased (1) by 1.7 percent if the water-supply intakes are lowered 5 ft, (2) by 3.5 percent if the spillway height is raised 5 ft, and (3) by 5.3 percent if strategies 1 and 2 are combined. Higher sea level and reduced future recharge will decrease water availability from the NGLA. The composite chloride concentration (an overall withdrawal-weighted average concentration) from production wells increases to 304 mg/L (well above the drinking water standard of 250 mg/L) for 2010 withdrawal rates under future climate conditions, compared with 126 mg/L under historic climate conditions. Most of this increase is due to reduced groundwater recharge because higher sea level only has a small role in increasing withdrawn water salinity. A redistributed withdrawal scenario in which the composite concentration is 291 mg/L offers only slight improvement. Should future droughts reduce recharge proportionally to the decreases observed during historic droughts, the composite concentration would be about 900 mg/L after two years of drought and more than 70 percent of Guam's production wells would produce water with a composite concentration greater than 500 mg/L. The evaluated mitigation strategies for increasing the potable yield of the NGLA in a future climate were reducing depths of deep production wells and reducing the withdrawal rates in selected wells projected to have higher chloride concentrations. A simulation including both strategies for the redistributed withdrawal scenario shows a significant improvement in composite concentration and volume of withdrawn water. The composite chloride concentration is lowered to 191 mg/L and the available yield is increased by 9 percent. In practical terms, these strategies would most likely have to be implemented by abandoning the deep wells and replacing them with shallower wells, by installing variable speed pumps in all production wells to allow each well's actual withdrawal rate to be set at its ideal withdrawal rate, and by having a fully integrated water system that would allow water to be piped to areas of greatest demand from areas of greatest supply. sum of which was uniformly distributed as recharge to all subareas in the south part of storm-drain zone 2 without the \"urban-builtup\" land-cover designation.

Soil types varied spatially and were assigned the same available-water-capacity values that were used by Johnson (2012). Land-cover designations also varied spatially, as shown in fig. 4 of Johnson (2012). The land-cover designation assigned to each subarea was used to assign four additional time invariant input parameters (pervious fraction, crop coefficient, root depth, and depletion fraction), as shown in table 2 of Johnson (2012). Only two land-cover classes, \"urban builtup\" and \"urban cultivated,\" were assigned pervious-fraction values less than 1.00, meaning subareas with these land-cover designations were assumed to contain impervious surfaces such as roads, buildings, and other paved areas. All remaining land covers were assigned pervious fraction values of 1.00. For all subareas with one of the seven forest land-cover designations, the Guam models computed net precipitation on the basis of daily precipitation (see Rainfall section below), canopystorage capacity (0.035 in), and a daily constant (1.095), as described in Johnson (2012). Forest-canopy evaporation was calculated as precipitation minus net precipitation. For all remaining subareas, those without a forest land-cover designation, net precipitation equaled precipitation, and forest canopy evaporation was set to zero in results of the Guam water-budget models. For subareas with the \"water\" land-cover designation, recharge was set at 12 in/yr, and actual evapotranspiration was computed by the models as the difference of precipitation and runoff minus 12 in. None of these subareas had water-main leakage or septic leachate. This approach also was used by Johnson (2012)."}, {"section_title": "Rainfall", "text": "Water-budget model inputs for rainfall consisted of mean monthly rainfall distribution for 1990-2009, annual rainfall weighting factors, and monthly sets of daily rainfall fragments. Precipitation equaled rainfall for all subareas because fog interception was assumed negligible for all parts of Guam, the same assumption used by Johnson (2012). The Guam waterbudget models synthesized daily rainfall for each subarea as the product of monthly rainfall and a daily rainfall fragment (each daily rainfall fragment represents the fraction of the monthly rainfall that occurred on that day), ranging from 0 to 1, as described in Johnson (2012). Monthly rainfall values for each year during 1990-2009 were computed in the models as the product of mean monthly rainfall values for 1990-2009 and an annual rainfall weighting factor. Monthly sets of daily rainfall fragments were assigned to each of the 18 Thiessen polygons shown in figure 2 of Johnson (2012). For a given subarea, the set of daily rainfall fragments used for a given month was selected randomly by the Guam water-budget models from among all available sets for the month and for the Thiessen polygon containing the subarea. Maps of mean monthly rainfall for 1990-2009 were not available for Guam. Previously, Johnson (2012) assigned each subarea a mean monthly rainfall value for 1971-2000 using the mean monthly rainfall maps of Daly and Halbleib (2006). For our analysis, 1990-2009 mean monthly rainfall for each subarea was estimated as the product of its 1971-2000 mean monthly rainfall value and a mean monthly rainfall-adjustment factor. Examination of available rainfall data obtained from the National Climatic Data Center (https://www.ncdc.noaa. gov) indicated that the station located at the Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport (see station labeled 226 in fig. 2 of Johnson, 2012) was the only station on Guam with complete rainfall records during 1990-2009. Therefore, rainfall records from this station were selected to compute one set of mean monthly rainfall-adjustment factors that was assigned to all subareas. Using the selected rainfall records, each of the following rainfall-adjustment factors was computed as the ratio of mean monthly rainfall during 1990-2009 to mean monthly rainfall during 1971-2000: 0.952 (January), 0.866 (February), 0.625 (March), 0.772 (April), 0.656 (May), 1.238 (June), 1.052 (July), 1.120 (August), 1.023 (September), 0.932 (October), 1.031 (November), and 1.132 (December). Using the same approach as Johnson (2012), rainfall records from the station located at the Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport also were used to compute one set of 20 annual rainfall-weighting factors for 1990-2009 (table 1.1). Each annual rainfall-weighting factor for a given year during 1990-2009 equaled the ratio of annual rainfall for the year to mean annual rainfall for 1990-2009. The annual rainfallweighting factors were applied to all subareas in the Guam water-budget models' calculations. To compute monthly sets of daily rainfall fragments, daily-rainfall records from stations on Guam were obtained from the National Climatic Data Center and from the USGS at https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis. Next, records from 14 stations were selected on the basis of location and record completeness during 1990-2009. Locations of the 14 selected stations are shown in figure 2 of Johnson (2012) with identification numbers of 001, 025, 156, 226, 275, 229, 468, 727, 950, 131105144405166, 131729144393766, 132132144422366, 132264144441966, and 132617144423366. The four additional stations used by Johnson (2012), shown with identification numbers of 193, 278, 827, and 133209144545301, were excluded from the analysis because their rainfall records were less than 20 percent complete during 1990-2009 and because nearby stations had more complete records during 1990-2009. Next, the daily rainfall records for the selected stations and the method described in Johnson (2012) were used to compute monthly sets of daily rainfall fragments. Fragment sets for each selected station were assigned to the station's Thiessen polygon shown in figure 2 of Johnson (2012). Fragment sets for stations 132132144422366, 275, 727, and 950 also were assigned to the nearby Thiessen polygons of stations 193, 278, 827, and 133209144545301, respectively.\nModel inputs used to simulate rainfall during 2080-99 consisted of (1) mean monthly rainfall estimates for 2080-99 for each subarea, (2) one set of 20 annual rainfall weighting factors assigned to all subareas, and (3) monthly sets of daily rainfall fragments assigned to each Thiessen polygon shown in figure 2 of Johnson (2012). For each subarea, mean monthly rainfall for 2080-99 was estimated as the product of its mean monthly rainfall values for 1990-2009 and mean monthly rainfall change factors. Each subarea was assigned one set of mean monthly rainfall change factors from the WRF-model grid cell that encompasses the subarea. The mean monthly rainfall change factors for each WRF-model grid cell were computed as the ratios of simulated mean monthly rainfall for 2080-99 to simulated mean monthly rainfall for 1990-2009 (see Using Modeled Climate Variables to Compute Change Factors for Simulating Rainfall and Reference Evapotranspiration During 2080-99 section above). Mean monthly rainfall change factors assigned to the subareas ranged from 0.528 to 1.814. One set of 20 annual future-rainfall weighting factors was used for the 2080-99 scenario (table 1.1). The weighting factors were derived from simulated rainfall values from the WRF model for 2080-99. For each WRF grid cell, simulated rainfall values were converted from depth to volume using the cell's area that overlapped the domain of the Guam models. Each annual rainfall weighting factor was computed as the ratio of Guam's simulated annual rainfall volume for an individual year during 2080-99 to Guam's simulated mean annual rainfall volume for 2080-99. Monthly sets of daily rainfall fragments for the 2080-99 scenario were derived from \"future\" daily rainfall records that were modified versions of the historic daily rainfall records used to create the monthly sets of daily rainfall fragments for the 1990-2009 scenario in the following manner: To modify the historic records, each Thiessen polygon shown in figure 2 in Johnson (2012) was assigned one set of mean monthly rainfall change factors and one set of mean monthly rain-day change factors. For a given Thiessen polygon, the assigned mean monthly rainfall change factors were computed as the quotient of (1) the average of the simulated 2080-99 mean monthly rainfall values for the WRF-model grid cells overlapping the Thiessen polygon and (2) the average of the simulated 1990-2009 mean monthly rainfall values for the WRF-model grid cells overlapping the Thiessen polygon. The same method was used to compute one set of mean monthly rain-day change factors for each Thiessen polygon. Because of the method used to round the simulated daily rainfall values derived from the WRF-model datasets, only days with rain amounts of at least 0.025 cm were considered rain days, and all remaining days were considered dry days. For each historic rainfall record that was assigned to a given Thiessen polygon (see Rainfall section above), the method described in the supplemental material of Gingerich and others (2017) was used to compute a record of \"future daily rainfall values\" based on the polygon's assigned rainfall and rain-day change factors. As described in the supplemental material of Gingerich and others (2017), the method used to compute the future daily rainfall values randomly selects new rain days and new dry days. To mitigate the effects of such random selection, 20 separate future daily rainfall records were created for each historic daily rainfall record. The future daily rainfall records and the method described in Johnson (2012) were used to compute monthly sets of daily rainfall fragments for each Thiessen polygon for the 2080-99 scenario.

Unlike septic leachate, water-main leakage was assumed to enter the soil at depths where it was not subject to ET."}, {"section_title": "Runoff", "text": "To compute runoff in the Guam water-budget models, subareas were grouped into the runoff regions shown in figure 8 of Johnson (2012). In all runoff regions other than regions 1 and 11, the models computed daily runoff for a given subarea as the product of daily rainfall and the region's assigned mean monthly runoff-to-rainfall (RR) ratio for the corresponding month (table 1.2). Methods used to estimate each region's mean monthly RR ratios are described next. Using the same approach as Johnson (2012), runoff regions 1 and 11 were assigned mean monthly RR ratios of zero. Runoff region 1 consisted of subareas where runoff to the ocean from all surfaces was assumed negligible. In runoff region 11, runoff from pervious surfaces also was assumed negligible, but runoff from impervious surfaces was accounted for using estimates of captured stormwater, as described earlier in the Captured Stormwater and its Allocation to Runoff or Recharge section. For all remaining runoff regions, mainly in southern Guam, mean monthly RR ratios used for 1990-2009 were greater than zero (table 1.2) and were estimated using the same method that Johnson (2012) used to estimate RR ratios for 1971-2000. Daily streamflow records were obtained for 13 USGS stream-gaging stations (table 1.2) and the following process was followed: 1. For each streamflow record, daily runoff values were estimated using the hydrograph-separation program of Wahl and Wahl (1995), as described in Johnson (2012). Values of N (number of days) and f (turning point test factor) in the hydrograph-separation program were respectively set to 4 and 0.9 for all stream-gaging stations. 2. Daily runoff values were summed into monthly values for each gaging station. 3. Three stream-gaging stations (16847000, 16848500, and 16858000) were selected as index stations to use for adjusting all mean monthly runoff values to 1990-2009 for the remaining 10 stations. Previously, Johnson (2012) selected the same three stations to use as index stations. Runoff records for the index stations were nearly complete during 1990-2009, and their few missing runoff values were estimated using the methods described in Johnson (2012). 4. For each index station, mean monthly RR ratios for 1990-2009 were computed as the ratio of its mean monthly runoff values for 1990-2009 to mean monthly rainfall for 1990-2009 averaged over its drainage basin. 5. One index station was assigned to each of the 10 non-index stations (table 1.2), using the same assignments as Johnson (2012). 6. For each non-index station, mean monthly direct runoff was calculated for the non-index station and for the assigned index station for an overlapping period when both stations were concurrently measuring streamflow (see \"Period of record used in calculation\" column in table 3 of Johnson, 2012). 7. For the assigned index station, mean monthly runoff during 1990-2009 was divided by mean monthly runoff during the overlapping period, resulting in 12 mean monthly runoffadjustment factors. Each mean monthly runoff value for the non-index station during the overlapping period was multiplied by the appropriate runoff-adjustment factor to compute 12 adjusted mean monthly runoff values. 8. For each non-index station, mean monthly RR ratios for 1990-2009 were computed as the quotient of (1) its adjusted mean monthly runoff values, and (2) mean monthly rainfall values for 1990-2009 averaged over its drainage basin. 9. The 1990-2009 mean monthly RR ratios for the 13 stations were used to assign ratios to each runoff region, using the same methods as Johnson (2012) and shown in table 1.2.\nA separate set of mean monthly RR ratios (table 1.4) was used in the Guam water-budget models for the 2080-99 scenario, because the distribution of Guam's mean monthly rainfall for 2080-99 is estimated to be different than the distribution estimated for 1990-2009 ( fig. 1.1). Jan. Feb. Mar. Apr. May June July Aug. Sept. Oct. Nov. Dec. The monthly RR ratios used for the 2080-99 scenario were estimated as the product of the RR ratios used for the 1990-2009 scenario (table 1.2) and a set of mean RR change factors assigned to each runoff region. Mean monthly RR change factors were estimated using runoff and rainfall results of Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) model simulations for southern Guam for historic and future periods (Rosa, 2017). The PRMS model output of Rosa (2017) included daily results for 317 areas termed hydrologic response units (HRUs) in southern Guam (fig. 3). All HRUs were selected for computing RR change factors except for the HRU representing FVR. Daily PRMS results selected for computing RR change consisted of results for 1990-2009 and 2080-99 for all selected HRUs except those in the Almagosa West, Almagosa, Imong, Maulap, and FVR_ungaged regions ( fig. 3), for which results were available for 1998-2009 and 2088-99 only. The set of RR change factors assigned to each runoff region was determined using the following steps: 1. For each runoff region, the area of each HRU within the region was delineated. 2. The selected PRMS results for the historic periods were used to compute mean monthly runoff in units of depth for each of the selected HRUs. The sum of two PRMS components, surface runoff and interflow, was considered runoff for this analysis. 3. For each area where an HRU overlapped a runoff region, mean monthly runoff volumes for the overlapping area were computed as the product of mean monthly runoff depths for the HRU and the overlap area. 4. The results of the previous step were summed by runoff region and by calendar month to compute mean monthly runoff values for each runoff region for the historic periods. 5. The previous three steps were repeated to compute, for each runoff region, mean monthly rainfall for the historic periods, mean monthly runoff for the future periods, and mean monthly rainfall for the future periods. 6. Results from the previous step were used to compute a set of historic mean monthly RR ratios and a set of future mean monthly RR ratios for each runoff region. 7. For a given runoff region and calendar month, the mean RR change factor was computed as the future mean monthly RR ratio divided by the appropriate historic mean monthly RR ratio. The estimated change factors ranged from 0.579 to 1.368 for runoff regions 2 through 10. The Fena Valley Reservoir, Guam, was surveyed in February 2014 by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). At full capacity, the surface area extends 192 acres, and it was determined that the storage capacity below the spillway crest was 6,915 acre-feet. The procedures used to measure the reservoir and calculate the storage capacity are documented in U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2015-5128 (Marineau and Wright, 2015). The original storage capacity estimated from pre-dam engineering drawings by Frederic R. Harris, Inc. (1949), was reported as 8,365 acre-feet. This indicates a decrease of 1,450 acre-feet of storage (or 17 percent) over the 63-year period of operation. A possible management scenario to be evaluated includes an estimate of the reservoir storage capacity under the condition of a 5-foot increase in dam and spillway height. This discussion provides that estimate using two different methods. The two estimates provided in this report use indirect methods to calculate the additional storage capacity above the spillway; however, the uncertainty of either estimate could not be readily calculated and thus, a quantification of uncertainty is not provided in this report."}, {"section_title": "Reference ET", "text": "Reference ET, as defined for our analysis, is the ET rate of a hypothetical grass surface completely shading the ground, of uniform height, and optimum soil-water conditions for given climatic conditions.

The potential ET, the maximum ET rate from the plant-root zone, was computed in the Guam water-budget models by multiplying the reference ET by the subarea's assigned crop coefficient. Water-budget model inputs used to simulate reference ET during 1990-2009 consisted of (1) mean annual reference ET (67.6 in, table 1.3), (2) one set of 20 annual reference-ET weighting factors (table 1.1), and (3) one set of 12 mean monthly reference-ET weighting factors. Each mean monthly reference-ET weighting factor equaled the ratio of mean monthly reference ET for 1990 (table 1.3) to 67.6 in. All three model inputs were derived from 1990-2009 daily reference-ET values that were computed using the method described in Allen and others (1998) and using daily climate records and solar-radiation estimates from the station at the Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport. Daily climate data (minimum air temperature, maximum air temperature, dew point temperature, and mean wind speed) during 1990-2009 were obtained from the National Climatic Data Center at https://gis.ncdc.noaa.gov/maps/ncei/cdo/daily. Daily incoming solar radiation was computed from hourly incoming solarradiation estimates obtained from the 1961-90 and 1991-2010 National Solar Radiation Databases, available at http://rredc.nrel. gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/. Rainfall and reference ET for the future 2080-99 period used inputs for the 1990-2009 period that were modified by mean monthly change factors. Climate variables for 1990-2009 and 2080-99 that were produced by simulations of the WRF-model analysis for Guam (Zhang, 2016) were used to compute change factors (Arnell andReynard, 1996 andothers, 2000) and prepare rainfall and reference-ET inputs for the Guam water-budget models for the 2080-99 scenario. The change factors represent ratios of WRF-modeled climate conditions for a future period (2080-99) to WRF-modeled climate conditions for a historic period (1990)(1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009). The change factors were used to modify historic rainfall and reference-ET datasets, and the resulting, modified datasets were used to create rainfall and reference-ET inputs for the Guam water-budget models for the 2080-99 scenario (see Recharge Model Inputs for 2080-2099 Scenario section below). Gingerich and others (2017) also used the changefactor approach to prepare model inputs for simulating future rainfall and reference-ET conditions in a similar water-budget analysis for Roi-Namur, Kwajalein Atoll. Computation of simulated reference-ET and rainfall values was done in the following manner: \u2022 For each WRF-model grid cell, the selected variables were used to compute simulated hourly reference-ET values for 1990-2009 and for 2080-99. Simulated reference-ET values were computed using the method described in Allen and others (1998) and by using separate surfaceresistance values for daytime (50 seconds per meter [s/m]) and nighttime (200 s/m), as recommended in Allen and others (2006). \u2022 The simulated hourly reference-ET values were summed into monthly and annual values. \u2022 For each WRF-model grid cell, hourly rainfall values from WRF model datasets were summed into simulated daily rainfall values, which were rounded to the nearest 0.025 cm (0.01 inch). \u2022 The simulated daily rainfall values for each WRF model grid cell were summed into monthly and annual rainfall values for 1990-2009 and for 2080-99. The climate variables in the WRF-model datasets were not directly used as model inputs to Guam water-budget models because these variables likely would have required adjustments for biases, and these bias adjustments would require additional efforts that were beyond the scope of our analysis. Instead, by using the change-factor method, the climate variables from the WRF-model simulations were assumed to represent relative changes between 1990-2009 and 2080-99."}, {"section_title": "Water-Budget Model Inputs for 2080-99 Scenario", "text": "A separate set of model input files was prepared for the 2080-99 scenario and was used in both Guam water-budget models.

New model inputs were developed to simulate rainfall, the relation of runoff to rainfall, and reference ET."}, {"section_title": "Method 1-Extrapolation of the 2014 Stage-Capacity Curve", "text": "A stage capacity curve at 0.1-foot intervals was generated from the 2014 bathymetric survey. All elevations in the 2014 survey were referenced to the Guam Vertical Datum of 2004 (GUVD04; Carlson and others, 2009). The curve generally follows a smooth form, and the upper 30 feet (between about 80 feet GUVD04 and the elevation of the spillway crest) can be approximated well by a 4th-order polynomial regression equation ( fig. 1). The spillway crest was measured at 110.8 feet GUVD04 during the 2014 survey (Marineau and Wright, 2015). Using the regression equation, the volume was computed for the elevation of 115.8 feet GUVD04, which is 5 feet above the elevation of the spillway as surveyed in 2014. Total storage capacity using this method was estimated to be 7,890 acre-feet (increase of 975 acre-feet over the 2014 storage capacity).

The lidar data were referenced to GUVD04. Bare-earth elevation points (laser penetrates between vegetation and reflects off the ground) and vegetation elevation points (in which the laser reflects off vegetation) are categorized during post-processing. If there are too few bare-earth elevation points in a given grid cell, the land-surface elevation at that grid point is reported as invalid. Dense vegetation along much of the shoreline caused many of the lidar grid points to be invalid (about 50 percent). These invalid grid points generally were spread uniformly between valid grid points, and most distances between valid grid points typically were only about 3-13 feet. The valid elevation data near the reservoir above the spillway elevation were merged with the 2014 bathymetric data points. Elevation between valid grid points was estimated using a spatial interpolation algorithm to create a continuous surface. Elevation data from the continuous surface were tabulated in a similar manner as the 2014 bathymetric data to create a stagecapacity curve that extends above the spillway elevation. The volume estimated using this method was 7,967 acre-feet (increase of 1,052 acre-feet over the 2014 storage capacity).

Although there is some uncertainty associated with each method, this uncertainty was not quantified for this report. The results from these two methods agree within 10 percent and may provide a general range in the potential additional capacity gained by a 5-foot increase in the elevation of spillway and dam."}, {"section_title": "Appendix 2.

The overarching goal of stakeholder outreach was to enhance the usefulness of the information generated in this research for individuals responsible for water-resource management. Stakeholder outreach during this study emphasized the iterative development of information deemed most relevant by decision makers managing water resources on Guam. In a series of engagements, the effect of alternative information presentation formats (for example, tabular, graphical, spatial/map-based, range) on decision makers' understanding and use of climate and hydrology information was examined. This outreach approach is well suited for both the resources and political environment in Guam, as it allowed the researchers flexibility in incorporating the dynamic on-the-ground reality of decisions related to water management on the island with desired future outcomes, both technical and policy-based, in the face of a changing climate. Risk communication and behavioral decision-making research provides a theoretical and methodological framework for understanding how climate science can be used by decision makers to establish management priorities. Several decades of behavioral decision research have demonstrated that the way information is presented affects how it is interpreted and weighted in decisions (for example, Finucane and Gullion [2010] Slovic, 1995). Prior work suggests that the use of uncertain information (and its impacts on judgments and decisions) is influenced by characteristics of decision makers, task information, and broader contextual factors. Building on this prior work, stakeholder outreach for this study aimed to explore: \u2022 What are decision makers' perceptions of the utility of alternative information formats in scenarios? \u2022 Which formats of information presentation (for example, tabular, graphical, spatial/map-based, range) affect decision makers perception of their understanding of climate and hydrology information?"}, {"section_title": "Stakeholder Outreach Objectives", "text": "The objectives of the stakeholder assessment and engagement activities were to: \u2022 Conduct initial assessment of key characteristics of the stakeholders, information about climate change and its impacts, and the broader contextual factors influencing understanding of and preferences for alternative management options; \u2022 Examine stakeholders' current use and understanding of climate and hydrology information; and \u2022 Explore stakeholders' perceptions of the usefulness of new information resulting from this project."}, {"section_title": "Appendix 3.

Each of these themes and related findings are described in more detail below. Engagement with scientists viewed as valuable-In general, interviewees were appreciative of previous work by USGS and enthusiastic about engaging in future work. Interviewees were particularly interested in learning about the influence of climate change on Guam's water resources and receiving support related to various water-management and communication strategies. Decisions that would benefit from climate projections are diverse-Interviewees identified many types of watermanagement decisions for which information about future climate conditions would be useful (table 3.2). Existing resources vary in familiarity and perceived usefulness-Existing resources, such as the USGS report \"The Effects of Withdrawals and Drought on Groundwater Availability in the Northern Guam Lens Aquifer, Guam,\" (Gingerich, 2013) were perceived as familiar and useful to decision makers. Respondents indicated a variety of uses for this report. Some suggested the report is helpful for increasing knowledge or getting \"a feel for what's going on.\" This increased knowledge was useful for briefing leaders in respondents' organizations and providing input for discussions about managing Guam water resources, particularly regarding how to redistribute pumping to minimize salinity. Other ways in which the report's scientific information is used includes: making presentations to others, citing information in another report, and using the information to justify another planning decision. Maps were considered the most useful way to display information, particularly if they reflect island-wide information so that water uses can be coordinated broadly. Information in tables is considered valuable for verifying that correct information has been used in the modeling. Some respondents suggested that the report should be used in conjunction with other documents, such as Guam's wellhead protection plan, especially when making development and planning (land use) decisions that might affect vulnerable areas. Comparative information is believed particularly valuable for decision makers. Respondents suggested that information is most useful when it allows comparison of the effects of existing pumping conditions on well salinity for alternative future climate conditions (including drought) and land-use conditions (including military buildup). Such comparisons allow planners to explore future pumping scenarios that could minimize effects of greater demand or reduced supply. Climate information is more difficult to understand than hydrological information and should be tied to actions-Respondents had most difficulty interpreting information about typhoon track figures and in integrating information about historical and future projected numbers of typhoons. In particular, confusion persisted about which storm tracks are considered \"near\" to Guam. Some found it difficult to see subtle differences in the shades of blue used to indicate average annual number of storms and typhoons, suggesting that alternative textures would be easier to interpret. Information about probability distribution functions seemed hardest for interviewees to understand. Some were unsure of the meaning of the height of the gray bars (observations) and suggested that it would be more easily understood if the bars were related more explicitly to the blue line (historical simulation) and associated management actions implied. Preferred information format depends on intended use and audience-As evidenced by respondents' range in familiarity with and ability to use climate and water information, decision makers have a wide range in background technical knowledge. Some need more time than others to study a graph to glean relevant information. Importantly, some may have the technical knowledge but do not have the time due to competing demands and multiple responsibilities they are managing as part of their leadership positions. Some respondents noted that decision makers are often multitasking, so scientists need to explain information simply with words (rather than numbers) in a very short time. One respondent emphasized that scientists need to be more \"consumer centric\" and to interpret the bottom line of the report for decision makers.

They noted that while not everyone has a good understanding of a map, understanding can be improved with recognizable landmarks (for example, local gas station, funeral home) from which they can compare other land uses. This information may provide perspective that may be valuable for both members of the public and resource managers in government and non-government agencies. Stakeholders had suggestions for improving the usefulness of climate and water information-Several general issues could be addressed on the basis of respondents' insights revealed during the interviews to improve the usefulness of climate and water information for water managers in Guam: \u2022 Conduct basic training on the issue of climate change (immediacy, experiences of neighboring island communities, and actions to be taken) and how to interpret climate information. \u2022 Create synthesis documents that are short and from a trusted source. \u2022 Provide executive summaries of climate projections and implications for water resource management that are no longer than two pages, in bullet format, and as selfexplanatory as possible. \u2022 Test messages to ensure intended meaning is being conveyed to specific audiences. \u2022 Ensure information (for example, basin boundaries) is consistent across different reports. \u2022 Establish relationships between scientists and decision makers and build trust and knowledge over time. Bidirectional communications in working group meetings along the way as research is being done and reports are being developed helps to improve readers' understanding when the final figures are produced because decision makers do not have to sit and study it in detail. In addition, several improvements were suggested to improve how climate and water information is presented: \u2022 Use different symbols or textures instead of shades of one color (especially important for government agencies without color printers). \u2022 Ensure that when using symbol size to convey variation, the different sizes can be distinguished by the reader. \u2022 Zoom in on Guam (and a little south and east) when presenting storm tracks because that is the most pertinent information for Guam decision makers. \u2022 Provide comparative information where possible to show change from average historical conditions and to provide information that indicates when action thresholds are implicated. \u2022 Ignore scenarios that are not economically feasible. \u2022 Embedding results in animations were of great interest to show the temporal components of water and climate projections. \u2022 When possible, have a bulleted sentence on a figure that simply states the take-home message for decision makers. Decision makers need training, collaboration, and technical information-Many interviewees, especially early in the study, report limited knowledge about climate variability and change and potential impacts on the water resources of Guam. Current models of recharge, water distribution systems, and stormwater drainage use historic/observed trends about rainfall, sea level, and streamflow. Interviewees suggested that a lack of technical expertise and budget limitations explained why climate projections have not been part of decisions about future water-management options. Most interviewees expressed strong interest in trainings and information exchange to improve understanding of climate variability and change impacts on Guam's water resources. Many expressed the concern that they have insufficient expertise to interpret climate information such as ENSO forecasts, but that such information would be helpful in managing water resources in the face of climate variability. GWA and NAVFAC expressed interest in working together and communicating about how to manage a shared resource. They support a collaborative dynamic and a need to precoordinate meetings. During the last year of the project, GWA and NAVFAC water managers started regularly meeting under the OneGuam framework to better coordinate, manage, and share information related to water supplies in Guam (see next point for additional information). New research results are considered interesting and helpful for water management-Respondents generally reported that USGS is considered a trusted source of information and their new research results are interesting and helpful in supporting their efforts to manage water resources on Guam. Several respondents were keen to make sure that their colleagues from other organizations (for example, Consolidated Commission on Utilities) were aware of the results and taking the new information into account in their decision-making processes. One example of the perceived value of the new results is in support of the OneGuam initiative by NAVFAC Marianas and GWA, which supports decision making aimed at creating a water-management system for Guam that better integrates federal and local government needs and goals. The OneGuam initiative includes a Technical Advisory Group that is a source of scientific expertise for the federal and local partners. A more codified mechanism was recommended for ensuring bidirectional flow of information between decision makers and scientists. For instance, if a decision (for example, to drill a new well or renovate an existing well) is being considered by OneGuam partners, then they should ask scientists to provide the latest data or information relevant to that decision to determine if it is consistent with longterm adaptive management goals (for example, to keep salinity at an acceptable level). Interviewees generally agreed that the most helpful information displays were maps, especially of example adaptive pumping scenarios in a future-climate scenario. Conveying specific spatial information (for example, how far inland should we move roads and utilities?) was considered important by some interviewees. Some limitations of the new information were noted by interviewees. For instance, some wanted more detailed description of how accurate the projections of the future climate conditions are (for example, confidence intervals or ranges). Others wondered about how water resources would be affected under future climate projections if two additional management actions were taken: (1) fixing leaky pipes and (2) redirecting stormwater into aquifers to recharge the groundwater supply. For instance, if we reduced leakage by 50 percent, how much of the climate-change impact on supply would that address? Or, if storm water management was more efficient, how would that change the need to consider alternative pumping scenarios? In general, specific analyses would be necessary to support specific objectives of resource managers (for example, if GWA needed the Public Utilities Commission to provide relief, such as through a bond, for a specific capital investment such as drilling new shallower wells). Finally, the new information was viewed as limited by some because of a mismatch with decision-makers' needs. For instance, the timeframe of the future-climate scenario (end of the century) did not correspond well to planning timelines of people responsible for short-term (for example, 3-5 years) decisions. Another example is that information about future reservoir levels needs to be consistent with other tools used by water managers (for example, information should be described so it relates to each GWA water-pressure zone). Interviewees recommended summaries separately address four main areas: \u2022 Background concepts: Summaries need to explain the bigger picture, such as (1) how Guam's groundwater and surface-water systems work (for example, what is a watershed and how does it affect the Northern Guam Lens Aquifer?); and (2) that climate change may lead to rainfall decrease which leads to less recharge and(or) increased sediment loads. A graphic of the freshwater lens and how it is impacted by a changing climate should be included. This background information was considered important for both lay and technical audiences. \u2022 Climate projections: A summary of projected changes in key climate variables was considered valuable (for example, rainfall, temperature, days over 90 \u00b0F, drought conditions, sea-level rise). This summary could be an updated version of the current two-page document about Guam climate and should include an \"as of X date\" to indicate when it is published. \u2022 Integrated climate-water model results: Analog conditions were considered most valuable for contextualizing results (for example, drought of record). A recharge map was also considered helpful, as was a threepanel figure showing the separate and combined effects of sea-level rise and decreased rainfall. \u2022 Examples of management options: Summaries need to respond to questions such as \"What should I do?\" or \"How do we implement capital improvement projects (that is, should we invest in changing the distribution or treatment system to deal with unacceptable salinity) to prepare for a 6-percent decrease in rainfall?\" Providing information about alternative management scenarios will help make the information actionable (for example, \"to avoid salinity problems, Guam needs to drill more wells-only to the recommended depth of 40 feet-with less productivity, rather than maintain fewer wells with more productivity\"). A key message several interviewees wanted to convey was that we should not presume rainfall will stay the same; whatever recharge ends up in the aquifer, we need to manage it appropriately so that it is a reliable resource for future generations."}, {"section_title": "Outreach and Communication Products", "text": "Upon request from stakeholders, several products were created, separate from technical reports and peer-reviewed manuscripts that clearly and concisely summarize the project's background, simplified main findings, and displayed a manageroriented style.
