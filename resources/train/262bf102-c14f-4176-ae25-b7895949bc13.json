[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "We report on a longitudinal study designed to assess possible sex differences in math achievement, math ability, and mathrelated tasks during the primary school age years. Participants included over 200 children from one public school district. Annual assessments included measures of math ability, math calculation achievement scores, rapid naming and decoding tasks, visual perception tests, visual motor tasks, and reading skills. During select years of the study we also administered tests of counting and math facts skills. We examined whether girls or boys were overrepresented among the bottom or top performers on any of these tasks, relative to their peers, and whether growth rates or predictors of math-related skills differed for boys and girls. Our findings support the notion that sex differences in math are minimal or nonexistent on standardized psychometric tests routinely given in assessments of primary school age children. There was no persistent finding suggesting a male or female advantage in math performance overall, during any single year of the study, or in any one area of math or spatial skills. Growth rates for all skills, and early correlates of later math performance, were comparable for boys and girls. The findings fail to support either persistent or emerging sex differences on non-specialized math ability measures during the primary school age years. D"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The relative predominance of men in mathematically intensive careers has been attributed, at least in part, to the reported gender gap in mathematics achievement (National Research Council, 1989) . Despite consensus regarding, and concern for, this gender disparity in mathematically oriented careers even among mathematically gifted male and female students (Benbow, Lubinski, Shea, & Eftekhari-Sanjani, 2000) , there is much controversy regarding the degree to which this disparity results from inherent vs. culturally influenced sex differences in math ability and performance. The research has been inconsistent in demonstrating whether sex differences in math are valid (e.g., Casey, Nuttall, & Pezaris, 2001; Ginsburg & Russell, 1981; Geary, 1994; Maccoby & Jacklin, 1974) , of significant magnitude (e.g., Friedman, 1989; Gonzales et al., 2004; Penner, 2003; Swiatek, Lupkowski-Shoplik, & O'Donoghue, 2000) , broad enough to affect overall math performance (e.g., Hyde, Fennema, & Lamon, 1990a) , or age-dependent (e.g., Hyde, Fennema, Ryan, Frost, & Hopp, 1990b; Leahey & Guo, 2001; Voyer, Voyer, & Bryden, 1995) . The present study was designed to examine boys' and girls' math performance during the primary school age years. Our aim was to assess the early manifestation of possible sex differences in math achievement, math ability, and math-related skills, including reading-related skills and visual spatial ability, on these commonly observed tasks. Although these issues have been examined in the literature to date, the present study contributes to the existing data by virtue of its longitudinal design. This allowed for assessment of growth curves in math skills during the first 4 years of school among a relatively random sample of primary school age children. Of interest is whether sex differences are apparent during the primary school age years overall, whether girls or boys are overrepresented in either the upper or lower quartiles of math performers, whether rates of growth in math-related skills differ for boys and girls, and whether there are potential sex differences in predictors of poor math achievement.\nReports of sex differences can influence beliefs and expectations of gender stereotypes (Brescoll & LaFrance, 2004) . Despite the fact that empirical reports of sex differences are predominantly attributed to a limited number of skills, particularly specific higher order tasks observed in later school years or adulthood (e.g., Hyde et al., 1990a; Pratarelli & Steitz, 1995) , discussion of sex differences in the media and lay publications may inappropriately lead to expectations for observable sex differences in the context of daily primary school activities. In order to address this notion, in the present study we examined performance on measures reflective of the kinds of tasks observed among primary school children in regular classroom settings."}, {"section_title": "Sex differences in math skills", "text": "Prior studies have reported conflicting results about the validity of sex differences in math, as reviewed in depth by Hyde et al. (Hyde et al., 1990a) . Reports in favor of boys refer to advantages in general math performance (Lummis & Stevenson, 1990; Maccoby & Jacklin, 1974; Mau & Lynn, 2000) ; while additional findings reflect superior performance on only specific tasks, such as those relying on spatial-mechanical skills (Casey, Nuttall, & Pezaris, 1997; Casey et al., 2001; Gallagher et al., 2000; Geary & DeSoto, 2001; Lummis & Stevenson, 1990) . Sex differences in favor of girls are reported at younger ages through preadolescence (Ginsburg & Russell, 1981; Kaplan & Weisberg, 1987; Marshall & Smith, 1987) . However, other studies have reported no significant sex differences in math abilities and achievement (Alyman & Peters, 1993; Geary, 1994; Tate, 1997) .\nIn cases where sex differences in math are indicated, the magnitude of these differences correlates with problem difficulty (Bielinski & Davison, 2001; Penner, 2003) and appear more pronounced among groups of lowor high-scoring individuals (Swiatek et al., 2000) . Although sex differences increase in magnitude with age, existing sex differences in math are small, and appear to be diminishing over generations (Friedman, 1989; Hyde et al., 1990a) . The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS study, Gonzales et al., 2004) reported a male advantage on general math skills in both fourth and eighth grades in 2003, however effect sizes were small at best (Cohen's d = 0.11 and 0.07, respectively), and both boys' and girls' mean scores had increased, by comparable amounts, since 1995. One consistency in the literature is the claim that the magnitude of differences varies with age (Hyde et al., 1990a,b; Leahey & Guo, 2001; Voyer et al., 1995) . For example, true sex differences are reported as nonexistent in infancy, minimal in early and later elementary school years, emerging at adolescence, and more consistently reported through adulthood. Studies of infants' mathematical skills typically fail to show sex differences in early skills, such as the ability to discriminate between small sets of numbers (Antell & Keating, 1983; Starkey, Spelke, & Gelman, 1990; Strauss & Curtis, 1981) , and in how quantity is affected by addition and subtraction (Starkey, 1992) . The understanding of basic numerical concepts is uniform across the sexes, in a variety of cultures, through the preschool and kindergarten years (Geary, 1994) . Indeed, few or no sex differences in quantifiable math abilities (i.e., counting skills, conceptual knowledge, or simple arithmetic skills) have been found before first grade (Lummis & Stevenson, 1990) . Four-and five-year old girls outperform boys, to minimal degrees, on simple arithmetic skills (Ginsburg & Russell, 1981) but in general there is no clear advantage of one sex over the other at this age.\nDuring the early school years, reports of sex differences in math continue to be inconsistent. Differences are either reported as nonexistent (Geary, 1994) , slightly favoring girls (Ginsburg & Russell, 1981) or favoring boys on specific tasks (Lummis & Stevenson, 1990) . Lummis & Stevenson (1990) claim that first grade boys demonstrate an advantage over girls in solving word problems and on problems that utilize visualization strategies. In the present study, we examine differences in math and visual spatial performance at four time points during the primary school age years on measures that reflect the types of tasks typically observed in regular classroom settings.\nAlthough our study focuses on the first 4 years of schooling, research on sex differences after primary school years is relevant to the present study because of its implication for potential indicators of emerging sex differences in early childhood. Yet research findings on the late elementary and middle school years are inconsistent. In a longitudinal study of over 7000 children, Marshall & Smith (1987) found no sex differences in third to sixth graders' basic conceptual understanding on arithmetic problems, although the girls outperformed boys due primarily to boys' procedural errors. Yet between elementary and junior high school years, boys surpass girls in their math skills (Leahey & Guo, 2001; Maccoby & Jacklin, 1974) . However, studies of math abilities in high school and adulthood typically report sex differences in favor of boys (Gallagher et al., 2000; Leahey & Guo, 2001; Mau & Lynn, 2000) ."}, {"section_title": "Sex differences among high achievers", "text": "The greatest sex disparities may occur among the highest-and lowest-achieving students (e.g., Benbow, 1992; Carr & Davis, 2001; Hyde et al., 1990a) , across all age groups. Leahey and Guo (2001) found that sex differences in math were most pronounced among a subset of high-achieving students from elementary school through high school. Among high-achieving groups, boys outperform girls on math tasks from third to sixth grade (Swiatek et al., 2000) and from eighth grade to post-high school (Reis & Park, 2001) . Boys have a slight advantage on easy math problems, and a greater advantage on more difficult math problems, with problem difficulty defined by the percentage of incorrect answers across the population (i.e., easy problems are those with a low percentage of incorrect answers; Penner, 2003) . Benbow (1992) reports that males outnumber females in both high ability and low ability groups in mathematics from adolescence through adulthood, although the differences are more pronounced in the higher achievement groups. Based on these findings, in the present study we examine differences not only in overall group means using analysis of variance tests but also in the frequency with which males or females are represented in the highest and lowest achievement groups using odds ratios. While the ANOVA tests for the level of variance within and between groups (boys and girls) from the mean, it does not directly address the level of variation among the extremes (highest and lowest achievers), which is of interest given the above findings. For this reason, we use odds ratios to consider the frequencies of participation in these groups."}, {"section_title": "Sex differences in spatial skills", "text": "Some aspects of mathematics are believed to have a spatial component (e.g., as reviewed by Fias & Fischer, 2005) , and correlations between math and visual spatial skills have been reported in early grades (Kulp, 1999; Kurdek & Sinclair, 2001; Mazzocco & Myers, 2003) . The shift toward male superiority in math, in higher grades, has been attributed in part to an increasing reliance on spatially based strategies, which boys are alleged to use more often (Benbow, 1988; Casey et al., 2001; Maccoby & Jacklin, 1974) . This notion is somewhat controversial, as it has not been supported in all studies, such as in Manger and Eikeland's (1998) study of sixth graders' mathematics and spatial visualization skills.\nComparable to findings on math skills, studies on sex differences for spatial abilities across the lifespan have yielded inconsistent findings. Levine, Huttenlocher, Taylor, and Langrock (1999) report a difference in favor of boys, at 4 years of age, on both rotation and translation skills. Kaplan and Weisberg (1987) found that third-grade girls performed significantly better than boys on tasks involving recognition of embedded figures. Vasta, Regan, and Kerley (1980) found no significant sex differences among 10-year olds on fine motor and gross motor skills, consistent with Manger and Eikeland's (1998) report of no sex differences among sixth graders on spatial visualization tasks. As noted by Voyer, Voyer, and Bryden (1995) , sex differences on spatial tasks do not appear at one age, rather, they emerge on different tasks at different preadolescent and adolescent ages, and their magnitude increases with age. In contrast to this notion, Johnson and Meade (1987) report a consistent male advantage on spatial performance starting at age 10 years and continuing through age 18. In adulthood, studies typically report more consistent findings of a male advantage on spatial cognition and ability measures (Geary, Saults, Liu, & Hoard, 2000) , with the largest discrepancy in favor of men on mental rotation skills (Crucian & Berenbaum, 1998; Geary, Gilger, & Elliott-Miller, 1990; Voyer et al., 1995) . Indeed, some argue that the spatial superiority reported for males is limited to very specific tasks, such as mental rotation tasks and location learning in young adults (Astur, Oritz, & Sutherland, 1998) . This means that sex differences may not be apparent on global tests of general spatial abilities, as Alyman and Peters (1993) have reported in their cross sectional study of spatial abilities using everyday prompts, from childhood to adulthood.\nThus the range of spatial skills used across studies is broad in terms of both the nature and complexity of skills required for success, which contributes to the inconsistency across findings. In the present study, we use a variety of spatial tasks limited to those commonly used in primary school activities or assessments. If spatial aspects of mathematics underlie some of the sex differences reported for math ability, it will be useful to assess whether rates of growth in spatial abilities differ for boys and girls."}, {"section_title": "Correlates of math performance", "text": "Studies have highlighted the interplay between both spatial and verbal skills and mathematics achievement across multiple school grades. For example, reading-related skills are as correlated with math achievement as are visual spatial skills, at least during the primary school age years, as both concurrent (Mazzocco & Myers, 2003) and predictive factors (Kurdek & Sinclair, 2001) . Auditory memory number skills and visual discrimination skills in kindergarten together predict variability in mathematics achievement in fourth grade (Kurdek & Sinclair, 2001 ). Both geometry grades and SAT-Verbal performance are strong predictors of SAT-Math achievement in collegebound students (Casey et al., 1997) . In the present study, we examine both verbal and spatial correlates of math performance, and whether the presence or strength of these associations varies between primary school age boys and girls."}, {"section_title": "Rationale for the present study", "text": "If it is true that sex differences in math and spatial skills are most apparent during middle or high school, there are three possibilities related to the emergence of these differences that together motivated the present study of primary school age children. The first possibility is that primary school age girls do not have any inherent difficulty with math or spatial skills, consistent with reports of no sex differences before seventh grade (e.g., Marshall & Smith, 1987; Vasta et al., 1980 ). An alternative possibility is that the differences that do exist are subtle, or limited to specific skills not commonly measured at younger ages and thus not as readily apparent, even if studied empirically. This notion is consistent with reports of sex differences with small effect sizes such as those reported by Manger and Eikeland (1998) and Hyde et al. (1990a) . The third possibility is that significant sex differences do exist, but have not been sufficiently examined. We address these possibilities, through a longitudinal study of over 200 children seen four times during their primary school age years.\nIn the present study, we sought to assess whether sex differences are evident during the primary school age years. Based on existing findings, we hypothesized that differences to emerge would have relatively small effect sizes. We examined whether there would be significantly more (or fewer) boys among the weakest or strongest math performers. To address the notion that male superiority in math emerges over time, we examined whether sex differences become more apparent over time, in the same group of children seen over 4 years; and whether growth rates for math and spatial skills are slower for girls. It is possible that sex differences in primary school age children are too subtle to be detected cross-sectionally and that growth rates may demonstrate significant differences. Finally, we explored whether the association between early and later math scores differs for boys vs. girls, using measures of skills commonly assessed during the primary school age years."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Participants were primary school students from a large suburban public school district who had enrolled in the longitudinal study while in kindergarten.

We administered an IQ test for descriptive purposes, whereas measures of mathematics ability, mathematics achievement, and spatial ability were administered to obtain the primary dependent variables of interest.

We administered the WASI one time, when participants were in third grade. We obtained IQ scores during third grade rather than sooner, because IQ scores obtained after age 7 years are more stable over time than IQ scores obtained before age 7 years (as reviewed by Sattler, 2001, p. 171 Response accuracy is based on conventional English phonology.

The version we used included four pages of 50 test stimuli that the child was to name aloud as quickly as possible. Although the RAN was administered during all 4 years of the study, age appropriate subtests were administered as follows: during only the first 2 years of the study, children were asked to name pictures of five common objects (e.g., brush, clock). During all 4 years of the study, children were given three subtests that involved naming colors, single digit numbers, or single letters.

First, we examined whether sex differences emerged on reading, spatial, or math skills at ages 5 through 8 years. For measures given two or more times, we carried out a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), using a 2 (Sex) \u00c2 2, 3, or 4 (Grade Level) design. This allowed us to assess possible main effects of sex, and possible grade by sex interactions. Main effects of grade were not of interest in the present study, given the expected increases in performance level over time for raw scores and the lack of a main effect of grade expected for age-referenced standard scores. Thus, grade effects are not reported in the results below. For measures obtained during only 1 year, we used unpaired t-tests, assessing only possible effects of sex.\nSecond, we examined whether the frequency of boys or girls was higher in the groups of children performing in the highest or lowest quartile, relative to their peer group. We used a generalized linear model to estimate the odds ratio (OR), and to determine statistical significance. In this case, logistic regression is most appropriate because we had only one binary predictor variable (boys vs. girls). In order to identify upper and lower quartiles, we had to consider that the tests administered in this study yield discrete test scores. Therefore, it was necessary to determine the position of the 25th percentile at a break-off point as close to the 25th percentile position as possible. In the cases for which a cutoff point was not straightforward, we selected to err on the side of fewer children in a group, to remain below (or above) the designated quartile.\nThird, to determine whether growth in reading, spatial, or math skills differed for boys vs. girls, we used growth curve modeling (GCM). GCM was carried out as a structural equation model, using the software package AMOS (Arbuckle & Wothke, 1999) , with sex (male, female) entered as a time-invariant predictor of both initial status and rate of growth in performance on the outcome variables of interest.\nFinally, we addressed whether there were sex differences in how well early verbal or spatial scores predicted later math achievement. The predictor variables included scores from the DTVP-2 Position in Space and RAN tests, both of which were positively correlated with a concurrent TEMA-2 score, as reported in another study (Mazzocco & Myers, 2003) . For this set of analyses, we carried out multiple regression models, including sex as a predictor variable.\nFor all analyses, the null hypothesis (H 0 ) was that there are no sex differences on overall group comparisons within a point in time, on comparisons of the upper and lower kth percentiles in a given point in time, or in rate of growth over time. We also predicted that verbal and spatial skills would be equally predictive of later math performance, for boys and girls. We used a significance level of a = 0.05 on all analyses, and assumed normality for the sampling distribution for all the data because of the large sample size. Table 1 shows the total sample sizes for each year of the study. Standard scores are presented for all tests, unless otherwise noted."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Preliminary analyses", "text": "Outliers were removed prior to data analysis. An outlier was defined as a score more than three standard deviations from the child's group (boy, girl) mean score. For each variable examined, the number of outliers represented was less than 3% (zero to six) of the total sample (~200 children). Outliers were omitted from ANOVAs and t-tests. They were not omitted from Odds Ratio analyses, because Odds Ratios are based on relative, rather than absolute, scores.\nWe used t-tests to determine whether there were IQ or age differences in our two groups, and found that mean IQ scores did not differ between boys and girls, p = 0.18, nor did the variance in IQ scores, p = 0.13. Therefore, IQ scores were not considered in the subsequent analyses. We also found that boys were slightly older than girls during each year of the study (see Table 1 ). This difference was statistically significant for all 4 years, from kindergarten through third grade, t(247) b 0.01, t(234) b 0.001, t(222) b 0.001, t(212) b 0.01, respectively. Since standard scores adjust for age, and raw scores do not, it was necessary to consider possible age confounds when main effects of sex emerged. Specifically, if a test is used to measure skills influenced predominantly by formal instruction (e.g., paper and pencil math calculation scores), then boys may have lower standard scores than girls simply because they are older than girls at the time of testing, and thus score blowerQ even if they receive the same grade-appropriate raw score. For this reason, when significant differences in standard scores were found in favor of girls on formal achievement tasks, we also examined raw scores to determine if the difference existed also in the actual number of correct responses. This was applicable to the WJ-R, KeyMath-Revised, and Math Facts tasks. As the TEMA-2 tests both formal and informal skills, we also examined the raw scores for this measure.

We report the results in terms of adjusted r 2 values. Table 4 is a summary of the correlations resulting from those analyses. As expected, kindergarten and first grade TEMA-2 scores were both strongly correlated with third grade TEMA-2 scores, ps b 0.0001. For each grade, earlier TEMA-2 performance accounted for approximately 30% to 40% of variation later observed in third grade TEMA-2 scores, adjusted r 2 = 0.315 and 0.412, respectively, and correlations were comparable when the regression models included only boys, or only girls, ps b 0.0001.\nWe ran three more sets of analyses. One set included both the RAN and DTVP scores combined, and the subsequent two models separately examined the degree to which each individual variable was correlated with the third grade TEMA-2 score.\nWhen using both the DTVP Position in Space and RAN Colors or Numbers subtests in the multiple regression, the results were significant whether the entire sample or only boys or girls were included, ps ranging from 0.03 to b 0.0001, and accounted for approximately 18% of the variation seen in third grade TEMA-2 scores, adjusted r 2 = 0.192, and 0.169, respectively.

Similar to the combined model described above, the RAN variables alone accounted for more variance in boys' third grade TEMA-2 performance, adjusted r 2 = 0.166 and 0.216, respectively, than in girls' third grade TEMA-2 performance, adjusted r 2 = 0.071 and 0.041, respectively. Our final model considered only the kindergarten or first grade DTVP Position in Space variable alone as a predictor for third grade TEMA-2 performance. Similar to the other models, the results were significant whether the entire sample or only boys or girls were included, ps ranging from 0.03 to b 0.0001. The DTVP Position in Space subtest scores accounted for 5% to 12% of the variation seen in third grade TEMA-2 scores, adjusted r 2 = 0.124 and 0.054, respectively.

The strength of these correlations was either comparable across boys and girls, or slightly stronger for boys, as summarized in Table 4 . The latter finding could be due to the greater variance in test scores seen in boys, providing a less restricted range of scores from which correlations can be measured."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The present study was designed to expand upon existing studies of sex differences in math skills during the primary school age years. Although sex differences in math skills have been studied extensively, findings regarding sex differences in early elementary school years are inconsistent. As such, we sought to add to the existing literature in three ways. First, we examined math scores from a variety of tasks indicative of those seen in primary school age classrooms, and we also examined performance in skills known to correlate with math performance, including reading-related and visual spatial skills. Second, we examined potential sex differences longitudinally, with a sample of sufficient size to detect relatively small effect sizes. Our longitudinal design also allowed us to examine whether sex differences become more apparent over time, in the same group of children, during the primary school age years, and whether growth rates for math and related skills differ between boys and girls. Finally, we explored whether the association between early and later math scores differs for boys vs. girls. We acknowledge that these findings are limited to children from one large school district, and that while a broad range of socioeconomic status levels was represented in our sample, the sample excluded students from the lowest and highest SES categories.\nOur findings predominately support the notion that sex differences in math, on standardized tasks similar to those seen in school for primary school age children, are minimal or nonexistent. There was no overall persistent pattern of findings suggesting a male or female advantage in math performance overall, nor during any one single year of the study or in any one area of math skills, such as paper and pencil calculations or counting skills. The same was true regarding children's performance on the spatial skills we assessed. While there were some main effects of sex from analyses of variance for some of the spatial and math tests, the majority of math and spatial variables did not demonstrate significant main effects that persisted over each year of the study. By design, the measures used in this study did not address any very specific skills or tasks on which differences have been seen unless these skills or tasks are in common use in a primary school setting, where sex differences may have a real effect on students' advancement or on teachers' perceptions and expectations.\nThere was also no consistent pattern of findings suggesting a male or female advantage for all of the math tasks, or all of the spatial skills. Indeed, there were as many significant results in favor of girls outperforming boys as there were for boys outperforming girls. The latter was observed only among a small subset of the math variables included in the study. Perhaps the most consistent finding in this study is simply that effect sizes remained relatively small, never exceeding moderate levels, and typically falling below 0.25. From the 73 effect sizes calculated, across 24 tests and subtests given over 1 to 4 years, 52 (71%) were b0.25, and 22 of these (42%) were V 0.10. Even the sex differences in the strength of the correlations we examined were neither consistently present nor consistently remarkable. In no case was a correlation significant among only boys (or girls), among those examined in the present study. Thus our findings fail to support a persistent, general male or female advantage on the math or spatial skills in use during the primary school age years.\nOur findings are consistent with many studies that report minimal or no sex differences in math skills in primary school age years. Several studies report no sex differences in basic conceptual understanding, from preschool and kindergarten (Geary, 1994; Lummis & Stevenson, 1990) , or from third through sixth grades (Marshall & Smith, 1987) . Our findings expand upon the previous report by showing no change in rate of growth of math skills from kindergarten through third grade.\nWe also acknowledge that there are studies suggesting a valid sex difference in early math skills. The discrepancy between our findings and those of others' may be due to cohort effects, age effects, or to the types of math and spatial tasks examined in the present study. Cohort effects could reflect the notion that, as some researchers have argued, widespread sex differences in math are diminishing over generations (Friedman, 1989; Hyde et al., 1990a) , as well as sex differences in math self-competence beliefs task values (Jacobs, Lanza, Osgood, Eccles, & Wigfield, 2002) . While earlier studies reported widespread sex differences (Maccoby & Jacklin, 1974) , recent studies generally report more consistent findings of sex differences at later ages (e.g., Leahey & Guo, 2001; Mau & Lynn, 2000) , among high ability samples (e.g., Benbow, 1992; Carr & Davis, 2001 ). A thorough discussion of possible causes for these cohort effects is beyond the scope of this paper. To summarize briefly, a range of environmental influences have been proposed as primary or mediating factors affecting the diminishing gender gap in math. For example, as disparities in gender roles have decreased over time, so too may any corresponding sex differences in math abilities, due to these socialization issues. For example, Kiesler, Sproull, and Eccles (2002) make specific reference to the influence of such socialization issues on girls' use of, and resulting performance in, computing activities from childhood through adolescence, high school, and college. Still, others have rejected arguments towards the influence of such socialization issues, including Kaplan and Weisberg (1987) , who found girls' performance on spatial tasks in third and fifth grades to be unaffected by societal interference. Others have argued that temperament of the child, reinforced by societal expectations, parental influence, and stereotypes, are key contributing factors to the existing gap between males' and females' math achievement (Penner, 2003; Leahey & Guo, 2001 ; as reviewed by Ben-Zeev, Duncan, & Forbes, 2005) . Whatever complex forces may be acting upon the proposed sex differences in math, our study fails to support the existence of such differences in young school age children.\nIt is possible that our current findings would have differed if our sample had been studied beyond third grade. Although some researchers argue that sex differences do not emerge until later grades, it is also possible that the findings of the current study are likely to persist with this cohort of children, at least until the 6th grade. We base this notion on the findings from others, such as Gross-Tsur, Manor, and Shalev (1996) , who failed to find differences in prevalence of math disabilities in fifth graders drawn from a cohort of over 3000 children. Sex differences may appear after that point, as other researchers claim that male superiority in math is most evident after puberty (Maccoby & Jacklin, 1974) , possibly as a consequence of hormonal changes alleged to affect specific math and spatial skills (Gouchie & Kimura, 1981) , and still limited to selective tasks. For example, Casey et al. claimed that by eighth grade, girls' poorer spatial-mechanical skills influenced their poorer performance on the male-favored items on the Third International Mathematics and Science Study, such as pictorial imagery and mental manipulation of images, while boys' superior performance on these items was due to the indirect effects of males' spatial-mechanical skills and their mathematics self-confidence (Casey et al., 2001; Gonzales et al., 2004) . It remains to be seen whether the cohort in the present study will manifest sex differences beyond third grade, but our current findings fail to support widespread or emerging sex differences during the primary school age years on the types of tasks that would lead to observable differences in the classroom.\nFinally, an additional explanation for the lack of sex differences in our study relates to the types of skills examined across our study and those of other researchers. Findings of sex differences in math during the primary school age years typically reflect highly specific skills, rather than a broad disparity between the sexes. Specific tasks include items such as simple arithmetic skills (favoring girls; Ginsburg & Russell, 1981) , problems that rely on visualization strategies (favoring boys; Lummis & Stevenson, 1990) , or math-related spatial-mechanical skills (e.g., Casey et al., 2001; Gallagher et al., 2000) including mental rotation (e.g., Astur et al., 1998; Levine et al., 1999) . In our study, we examined composite scores on a broad range of math ability, paper and pencil calculation, and counting skills, and a similarly broad array of visual perception or visual motor skills, as typically assessed in primary school children. Although we do not propose that findings of sex differences on very specific tasks are necessarily invalid, we do propose that, based on our findings and those of others (e.g., Geary, 1994 ; as reviewed by Alyman & Peters, 1993; Tate, 1997; Marshall & Smith, 1987) , there is much evidence to support the lack of either widespread, persistent, broad, or emerging sex differences in observable classroom achievement in primary school age children. Thus our findings support the notion that the existing evidence for sex differences in math and spatial skills are not justifiable grounds on which primary school teachers should base expectations or explanations for their young students' performance.
