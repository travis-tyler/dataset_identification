[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The objectives of the study were to characterize male sexual functioning as related to age in community-dwelling older men. In 1989, a random sample of men aged 40-79 y (n \u00bc 2115) without prior prostate surgery, prostate cancer, or other conditions known to affect voiding function (except benign prostatic hyperplasia) was invited (55% agreed) to participate in the Olmsted County Study of Urinary Symptoms and Health Status Among Men. In 1996, a previously validated male sexual function questionnaire was administered to the cohort. The questionnaire has 11 questions measuring sexual drive (two questions); erectile function (three) and ejaculatory function (two), as well as assessing problems with sex drive, erections, or ejaculation (three); and overall satisfaction with sex life (one). Each question is scored on a scale of 0-4, with higher scores indicating better functioning. Cross-sectional age-specific means ( 7 s.d.) for drive, erections, ejaculation, problems, and overall satisfaction declined from 5.2 ( 7 1.5), 9.8 ( 7 2.5), 7.4 ( 7 1.4), 10.7 ( 7 2.2), and 2.6 ( 7 1.0), respectively, for men in their 40s to 2.4 ( 7 1.6), 3.3 ( 7 3.4), 3.6 ( 7 3.2), 7.7 ( 7 3.8), and 2.1 ( 7 1.2) for men 70 y and older (all Po0.001). The cross-sectional decline in function with age was not constant, with age-related patterns differing by domain. The percentage of men reporting erections firm enough to have intercourse in the past 30 days declined from 97% (454/468) among those in their 40s to 51% (180/354) among those in their 80s (Po0.001). In age-adjusted analyses, men reporting regular sexual partners had statistically significantly higher levels of sex drive, erectile function, ejaculatory function, and overall satisfaction than those who did not report regular sexual partners. Sexual drive, erectile functioning, ejaculatory functioning, and overall sexual satisfaction in men show somewhat differing cross-sectional patterns of decline with advancing age. Active sexual functioning is maintained well into the 80s in a substantial minority of community-dwelling men."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "With the advent of new therapies for erectile dysfunction (ED) have come a proliferation of studies reporting the prevalence of ED. ED has been shown to increase with increasing age with prevalence estimates in community-based populations ranging from less than 1 to 11% for men in their 40s to 15-79% for men 70 and over. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] The wide variation in estimates may be partly because of the disparate definitions of ED between studies. Many of these studies focused largely on ED alone, and did not provide information on other important aspects of sexuality in men.\nThe brief male sexual function inventory was developed as a validated, parsimonious way to characterize sexual function by clinicians and researchers. 14 The questionnaire consists of questions regarding sex drive, erectile function, ejaculatory function, sexual problems with drive, erections and ejaculation as well as overall satisfaction with sex life. This report describes the prevalence of various aspects of male sexual functioning as measured by the Brief Male Sexual Function Inventory, and relates these measures to age and other factors in a randomly selected, populationbased sample of men."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "The Olmsted County Study of Urinary Symptoms and Health Status Among Men is a prospective cohort study begun in 1989 and has been described in detail in previous publications. 15, 16 Briefly, an age-stratified random sample was drawn from an enumeration of nearly all Caucasian male Olmsted County, MN residents between the ages of 40 and 79 y. Subjects were excluded if they had prior prostate surgery, prostate cancer, or any of a number of specified medical conditions that would affect normal urinary function (other than BPH). At baseline, participants in the community cohort (n \u00bc 2115; 55% response rate) were visited in their homes and completed a previously validated selfadministered questionnaire with a field research assistant present. 15 Follow-up of participants by questionnaire has been conducted approximately every 2 y. Details of the cohort follow-up have been published previously. 15, 16 Men lost to follow-up were replaced by others from the community. 16 In an effort to better understand their sexual function, a previously validated male sexual function index 14 was included in the questionnaires administered to this cohort in 1996. The questionnaire consists of 11 questions comprising five sexual function domains: sexual drive (two items), erectile function (three items), ejaculatory function (two items), sexual problem assessment (three items), and sexual satisfaction (one item). Details on sexual function questionnaire development and validation are presented elsewhere.\n14 All questions were scored on a scale from 0 to 4 with domain scores equalling the sum of the individual questions comprising the domain. The range of the domain scores were 0-8 for sexual drive, 0-12 for erectile function, 0-8 for ejaculatory function, 0-12 for sexual problem assessment, and 0-4 for overall satisfaction with sex life, respectively. Lower domain scores indicate impaired sexual function.\nDescriptive statistics and cumulative percentile plots were used to describe the distributions of the various domains by age group and frequency of responses for each question by age group. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were used to describe the inter-relation between the various domains of the sexual function inventory (see Table 1 ). Analysis of covariance was used to investigate differences between individual sexual function domains while adjusting for age. Since the questionnaire elicited questions of a sensitive nature, some men refused to answer some of the questions. Missing data ranged from 12 to 14% for individual questions. A total of 1883 men provided at least one answer on the sexual function questions. Missing questions within any domain resulted in a missing domain score for that domain. All available data were used in the analyses."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The mean age of the cohort at questionnaire completion (n \u00bc 1883) was 59.3710.5 y of age. In addition, the cohort was predominantly Caucasian with 91% reporting being married or living with a partner and 88% reporting having completed high school or higher. All domain scores appear to decline with advancing age, but sexual interest, problem assessment, and satisfaction showed less decline than erectile and ejaculatory function. Domain scores tended to be moderately to highly inter-related with Spearman's correlations ranging from 0.39 to 0.70 (Table 3 ). The cumulative percentile curves indicate a clear shift in the entire distribution toward greater sexual dysfunction with increasing age (Figure 1 ).

In the Cologne Male Study involving almost 4500 30 to 80-y-old German men, Braun et al 7 reported rates of ED ranging from 9.5% in 40 to 49-y-old men to 53.4% in men 70-80 y old. 7 In a population study of almost 2200 men in Finland, 3% of men in their 50s reported complete ED defined as intercourse does not succeed compared to 30% for men in their 70s. In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, ED reported for men in their 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s were 8, 25, 55, and 75%, respectively. 12 The wide variability of ED seen between studies may be due in part to differences in definitions of ED as well as differences in study design. Our results were similar in magnitude to those found in the MMAS where the study design was comparable. In contrast, our results were lower than that found in the Cologne study, where a mail-based questionnaire was sent to an age-stratified population of 8000 German men 30-80 y of age."}, {"section_title": "Ejaculatory dysfunction", "text": "Very few population-based studies have assessed ejaculatory function. In our study, the proportion of men reporting 'a lot of difficulty' ejaculating when they have been sexually stimulated ranged from 1.8% for men in their 40s to 6.8% for men 70 y and older. Nine percent of 40 to 49 and 50 to 59-y-old men participating in the National Health and Social Life Survey reported that they were unable to achieve orgasm. 6 In a community-based study of 50 to 79-y-old French men, subjects reporting that they had ejaculation difficulty 'each time' ranged from 3% for men in their 50s to 12% for men in their 70s. 2 In the Krimpen study of male urogenital health, it was found that 4% of men younger than 65 y reported a complete absence of ejaculation when stimulated compared to 16% of men 65 y and older. 9 In addition to ejaculatory difficulty, even fewer studies have reported problems with ejaculate volume. This may be because of the fact that respondents tend to poorly report ejaculatory function.

A later follow-up of this group indicates that only 20% of men were still sexually active by age 78 y. 11 In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, 55% of men age 75 y, and 75% of men age 80 y report no erections at all. 12 "}, {"section_title": "Problem assessment", "text": "Men vary greatly in the way they are affected by sexual dysfunction.

In the same study, 18-21% of men reporting reduced ejaculation stated that reduced ejaculation was a problem. In our study, 2.3-8.8% of men 40-70+ y reported that their ability to get and keep erections was a big problem, 0.9-3.4% of men 40-70+ y reported that the amount of semen that they ejaculate was a big problem, and 1.3-9.3% of men 40-70+ y reported that their lack of sex drive was a big problem."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "As found in previous studies, an age-related decrease in erectile function and sexual functioning was found for all sexual function domains assessed. Distribution of a brief sexual inventory in community men MP O'Leary et al\nAs life expectancy nears 80 y in most developed countries, concern with sexual problems and interest in therapeutic strategies will likely increase. In this cohort of community men, it is clear that although all domains of sexual function decline with age, sexual desire is maintained well into the eighth decade in most men, and a substantial minority of these men still report good overall sexual function. In this population, men with regular partners report better sexual function than those who have none. This seems intuitive, but it has not been well documented in previous studies.\nThe age-related cross-sectional decline in self-report of ejaculatory ability is less rapid than self-reported erectile ability. Men report that their ejaculatory ability declines less rapidly than erectile ability. The reasons for the decline in sexual function in this study cohort are not clear, and are no doubt multifactorial, including psychological as well as physiological causes. However, given the crosssectional nature of these results, no causal inference can be made. In addition, disparate definitions of sexual function components between studies may have also contributed to the wide variability of reported results. This study provides normative data for various aspects of sexual function in a randomly selected community-based sample of men. This parsimonious set of questions has been shown to be both valid and reliable, and can be used by urologic researchers in the evaluation of men on treatment or with conditions that may affect their sexual function. In addition, this questionnaire may be useful in the office setting to assess sexual function as part of everyday care, especially since normative population data are now available. Further research is needed with the Brief Male Sexual Function Inventory to determine which cut points of the sexual function domains are optimal for identifying clinically significant sexual dysfunction. Moreover, normative data of the Brief Male Sexual Function Inventory in other countries need to be established to facilitate comparisons between cultures."}]
