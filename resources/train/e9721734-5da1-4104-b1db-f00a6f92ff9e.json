The availability of proteases in the host such as furin, TMPRSS2, trypsin, cathepsins and human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT) cleave spike proteins that largely determine whether CoVs enter cells through plasma membrane or endocytosis (25) .\nFor fusion and the release of viral RNA genome into host cytoplasm, the virion undergoes various modifications by lysosomal cysteine proteases, cathepsin L and cathepsin B in the endolysosomes and this step is found to be highly pH-dependent. Highly acidic endosomal pH is needed for the fusion and eventually uncoating of the envelope (25) . Further, the viral genomic RNA is released into the cytoplasm and translates into two viral replicase polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab that encode non-structural proteins, and form replication-transcription complex (RTC) (26) . Continuously the polymerase produces a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs and finally translates into relevant viral proteins. Furthermore, endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi together assemble the newly formed genomic RNA, envelope, nucleocapsid and glycoproteins in vesicles thereby the virion fuses with the plasma membrane to release outside the cell. The envelope protein E has conserved the functional features, such as ion-channels and a PDZ-binding motif (PBM) which is required to induce virulence (27). The virus can infect ACE2-bearing cells in organs such as lung, esophagus, mouth, heart, intestines, bladder, and kidney (28) (Figure 3 ). J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f from BAL or throat swab from nine patient samples and found interesting observations that the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences exhibited more than 99\u00b798% sequence similarity among different patient samples tested, which shows that the smaller degree of diversification. They also found an 88% similarity to bat derived SARS like CoVs including bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Interestingly, this study also compared the similarity to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, where it was observed a 79 and 50% similarity which indicates that these viruses are distinct to SARS-CoV-2. Surprisingly, in late December Wuhan bat species were in hibernation and were not available for sale in the seafood market. This report also speculates that and various evidences has been described in Table 2 .\nCoV-2 infections as well and studies may be designed to evaluate the same in vitro and clinical conditions (101) . The FDA approved antiparasitic drug Ivermectin is widely used as an essential medicine to treat lymphatic filariasis, strongiloidiasis, ascariasis, head lice, scabies, and river blindness etc (102) . Ivermectin was tested for its repurposing antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, where it has shown excellent antiviral activity. The in vitro results suggest that\nIvermectin reduced viral RNA load >5000 fold with 5 \u03bcM concentration at 48 h (103) . It might be a good repurposing drug in treating SARS-CoV-2 infections and further studies are required for this specific use."}, {"section_title": "SARS-CoV-2 transmission, symptoms, incubation, and clinical characteristics", "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious with powerful transmissibility. The current evidence suggest that human-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by coughing or sneezing from the infected individual through respiratory droplets (droplet particles >5-10 \u03bcm in diameter) in close contact (within 1 meter) or as droplet nuclei (particles <5\u03bcm in diameter) which can remain in the air for long periods and be transmitted to others over distances greater than 1 meter. The transmission is also possible with the indirect contact with surfaces in the immediate environment exposes to the mucosa by nose and mouth or conjunctiva (eyes) for the viral entry During an emerging pandemic outbreak of an infectious disease, it is essential to know the level of transmission and the contagiousness which can be estimated by \"R naught\" (R0), a mathematical term which is the basic reproduction number that determines the average number secondary cases who are previously free of infection gets infected by one sick host. If the R0 is less than one the existing infection causes less than one infection, in such cases the spread J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f declines and disappears. If R0 value equals 1, each existing infection causes one new infection. If R0 is more than 1, each existing infection may spread on an average more than one individual which may lead to dramatic increase in transmission and may result in epidemic (45). The R0 value of SARS was ranging from 1 and 2.75, while the R0 of MERS-CoV was <1. The R0 of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China was estimated to be in the range of 2.24 to 3.58 in the early phases (46). Steven Sanche et.al found that R0 of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be 5.7 (47). Data from six different studies estimated that R0 could range from 1.5 to 6.49, with an average of 4.2.\nHowever, WHO estimates R0 from 1.4 to 2.5 (48). COVID-19 affected people patients serum show SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid viral load (RNAaemia)(49) and exhibits the symptoms which include fever, coughing, sneezing, throat pain, anorexia, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting dyspnea, the other characteristics most commonly exhibited are prolonged prothrombin time and lymphopenia. However, there are documented additional fatal complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, and incidence of grand-glass opacities (an area of increased attenuation in the lung on computed tomography (CT) with preserved bronchial and vascular markings in the periphery of the lungs with haziness overlying an area of the lung) (50) in some cases which lead to increased mortality rate (51). Recent evidence suggest that 97.5% of infected individuals develop symptoms within 11.5 days and the median incubation period to develop symptoms was estimated to be 5.1 days and 101 out of every 10000 cases were found to develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine (52).\nBy Jan 2, 2020, SARS-CoV2 complications were studied in a case series on initially hospitalized 41 COVID-19 confirmed patients. Among the cases 73% of the infected patients were men, 20% diabetes, 15% had hypertension and 15% of cases had other cardiovascular diseases. All patients J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f in common had pneumonia. The other common symptoms were fever, myalgia or fatigue, cough, and the less common symptoms were hemoptysis, sputum production, lymphopenia, dyspnoea, diarrhea, and the other complications are ARDS and secondary superinfections (53).\nCytokine storm refers to an aberrant or uncontrolled release of proinflammatory cytokines that lead to acute inflammation and pyrexia, which begins at a local site and spreads throughout the body via the systemic circulation. The previous out breaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have witnessed acute lung injury (ALI), ARDS and death which is accompanied by rapid virus replication that led to excessive inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokine storm (54). Similarly, now in COVID-19 outbreak, elevated cytokine levels are observed in critically ill patients. A case report by Chen et al, has observed a markedly higher levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-10, IL-2R, and IL-6, with remarkable reduction in CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, nearly in all 11 severe cases tested as compared to 10 moderate cases. The reduction in T lymphocyte number may further reduce the production of IFN-\u03b3 (55). These findings are in line with Pederson et.al and Diao et.al which demonstrated that the depletion of T cells and dysfunction in COVID-19, which can be implicated with the cytokine storm through the activation of highly inflammatory macrophages that produce the inflammatory cytokines and may dampen adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, an increase in the inflammatory indicators such as D-dimer and procalcitonin were found (56,57). Based on the clinical data by Hui Li many critically ill COVID-19 patients developed typical sepsis symptoms such as cold extremities, shock weak peripheral pulses and severe metabolic acidosis and hypothesized that the viral sepsis could be one of the critical clinical manifestations in cytokine storm. However, very little is known about the involvement of Toll like receptors (TLR) (58). In another case study, the COVID-19 patients plasma samples were analyzed for cytokines by multiplex assay, where IL-1\u03b2, IL-7, IL-10, IL-8, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f IL-9, basic FGF, IL1-RA, GM-CSF, G-CSF, IP-10, MIP-1A, MIP-1B, MCP-1, PDGF, TNF-\u03b1,   VEGF, and IFN-\u03b3 were found to be elevated in both (Intensive care unit) ICU and non-ICU   patients, while no apparent changes were found in the levels of IL-15, IL12p70, IL-5, Eotaxin, and RANTES when compared to healthy adults. On the other side, the higher plasma levels of IL-7, IL-2, IL-10, GSCF, TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and IP-10 were observed in ICU patients in comparison with non-ICU patients. This data suggest that the disease severity might be through the involvement of cytokine storm with SARS-CoV-2 infected critically ill patients (53).\nAnother case series was on 138 hospitalized patients, where the symptoms are consistent with the previously mentioned case report, all of the 138 patients showed bilateral involvement, critical illness was seen in older patients with co-morbidities. Apart from these symptoms, prolonged prothrombin and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels were observed in 80 and 55 patients, respectively. Another observation was a gradual increase in blood urea, creatinine levels, neutrophils and lymphocytes counts before death. The other major complications during hospitalization are shock, arrhythmia, ARDS, and acute kidney injury (59). Chen and colleagues based on a retrospective, single-center study on 99 cases (20), subsequently, Qian and colleagues reported that in 67.03% infected patients had multilobe infiltration in 53.85% patient population and an elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) was seen, further in 15.39% patients elevated levels of procalcitonin was detected. Interestingly, in one case report COVID-19 had been detected from the rectal swab, who suffered from abdominal symptoms but tested twice negative by throat swab (60). Therefore, along with the antiviral therapy it may be crucial to use antiinflammatory agents in treating COVID-19 patients. Theoretically, corticosteroids may suppress lung inflammation, and they have been prescribed in 72.2% of ICU patients (61) but its efficacy in treating the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients is still controversial as the concerns J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f centered around their short-and long-term adverse effects as well as promotion of viral rebound and ARDS (62).Therefore, it is important to identify the cytokine storm in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the mechanism behind the cytokine storm. It would also be important to elucidate the role of anti-inflammatory agents against SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammation."}, {"section_title": "Prevention of COVID-19 entry and its transmission", "text": "WHO Director-General constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern for the outbreak of COVID-19, recommends the options to prevent the disease in new areas and possible reduction in human-to-human transmission to curtail its further spread that can be achieved by the strict quarantine, which involves the movement restriction or separation from the rest of the population with sustained and intense hygiene measures (63). Avoiding mass gatherings in enclosed spaces, maintaining the distance of at least 1 meter from any person with respiratory symptoms (e.g. coughing, sneezing); wearing a medical mask for an adequate level of protection combined with hand hygiene frequently by using an alcohol-based hand rub or soap is recommended. The people who develop a febrile illness or respiratory symptoms at any point during the quarantine period should be treated and managed as a suspected case of COVID-19 (64) . Healthcare personnel must use the personal protective equipment (PPE) such as N95 or FFP2 standard masks, gowns, gloves, eye protection shields to protect themselves, patients, and others when providing the care (65)."}, {"section_title": "Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors in SARS-CoV-2 patients", "text": "RAS and ACE2 inhibitors are widely used in treating patients with hypertension. As described earlier ACE2 is the target receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and is highly expressed in epithelial cells in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the oral mucosa (66) . Additionally, this protein is widely expressed in immune reactive cells such as macrophages, lungs, blood vessels and intestine (67) . Clinical findings suggest that circulating ACE2 levels were significantly increased in diabetic and cardiovascular patients, however, this protein is aberrantly expressed with ACE inhibitors Lisinopril alone (68) .\nBut the ACE2 activity is not altered correspondingly, while cardiac ACE2 mRNA expression was increased with RAS receptor inhibitor Losartan. Combination of Losartan and Lisinopril did not affect the ACE2 activity compared with Losartan alone, but on other side, ACE2 mRNA was highly expressed with Losartan alone (69) . Thus there is a lack of correlation between up and down expression of ACE2 mRNA with ACE2 activity. However, there is a debate on the use of RAS and ACE inhibitors in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia infections and few clinical trials are going on for the usage of Losartan among patients who have not previously administered with RAS inhibitors and are either hospitalized (NCT04312009) or not hospitalized (NCT04311177) (70, 71) . The selective ACE2 inhibitor DX600 might show beneficial results in SARS-CoV-2 infections; however its clinical significance in COVID19 has not evaluated (72) . Further, in one promising study, circulating recombinant human soluble ACE2 protein upon intravenous administration produced significant blockade of initial stages of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and infections by preventing the binding of viral spike protein onto cell host cell surface ACE2 receptors (73) .\nJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f used to treat amebiasis (75) and other autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (76) and lupus erythematosus syndrome (77) . Chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine inhibit the heme polymerase in malarial trophozoites, preventing the conversion of heme to hemozoin. Plasmodium species continue to accumulate toxic heme, killing the parasite and exhibits antimalarial activity (78) . Whereas the antiviral activity of chloroquine is exerted by diffusing into the host cells and accumulating in endosomes, lysosomes and Galgi complexes, where it is converted into protonated form, then this moiety is deposited in organelles and further involve in raising the surrounding pH (79) . The raised pH in endosomes and lysosomes prevent viral fusion and inhibits the viral entry by endocytosis into the cells (80) . ACE2 is the target receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 for viral fusion, however, chloroquine does not affect the ACE2 levels but downregulated the terminal glycosylation of ACE2 (79, 81, 82) . Insufficient Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine has been used extensively to understand the mechanism of Nanoparticles uptake into cells. It was used as inhibitor of Nanoparticles uptake via endocytosis pathway. Similar kind of viral particle entry through endocytosis route is proposed to be inhibited by Chloroquine (83) . Artemisone found to be effective against human cytomegaloviruses, but effect of these compounds on SARS-CoV-2 needs to be evaluated (89,90). Moreover, the severe inflammatory cytokine storm observed in multiple organs may be curtailed by Chloroquine due to its immunomodulatory effects."}, {"section_title": "Antibacterial and antihelmintic drugs", "text": "Azithromycin is a renowned antibacterial drug belongs to the class of macrolide antibiotics. patients.\nThe fluoroquinolone antibacterial drug Ciprofloxacin is used to treat respiratory tract infections.\nApart from its antibacterial activity, it can reduce the replication of polyoma BK virus.\nCiprofloxacin reduced the viral load with IC 50 value (50% virus inhibitory concentration) of 216.67 \u00b1 16.7 \u03bcg/ml, whereas, Coumermycin showed the IC 50 value of 10.6 \u00b1 3.9 \u03bcg/ml (96).\nThe aminoglycoside antibiotics including Neomycin, Kasugamycin, and Streptomycin inhibited herpes simplex, influenza A and Zika virus replication by upregulating the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) (97).
