[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Supported by Goal Six of the Goals Act, several Federal programs and initiatives currently are underway to counter and deter crime and violence in schools. In connection with these efforts, Congress passed legislation requiring the National Center for Education Statistics to collect data to determine the frequency, seriousness, and incidence of violence in elementary and secondary schools in the States. The data will be used to evaluate the impact of Federal programs and initiatives designed to prevent violence in schools. ESSI/AIR presents in this report an overview of the extant national datasets that can be used to satisfy the legislation. We describe the information related to school crime and violence present in the datasets, and, when possible, we provide a brief assessment of the quality of that information. We also identify and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of a report to Congress based upon the most recently collected data. Finally, we provide recommendations for developing a survey system designed to collect rigorous and detailed information on crime and violence in schools."}, {"section_title": "Definition and Discussion of the Constructs used to Assess Crime and Violence in Schools", "text": "In order to delineate the task of screening the datasets for information pertinent to the seriousness, frequency, and incidence of crime and violence in schools, we first defined the terms \"crime,\" violence\" and \"school.\" We also identified operational definitions for the constructs typically used to measure crime and violence, including incidence and rates of victimization and prevalence. Below, we define and discuss these terms and constructs."}, {"section_title": "School Crime and Violence", "text": "We defined crime as any violation of a statute or regulation or any act that the government has determined is injurious to the public, including felonies and misdemeanors, committed on school property (after The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act, Model Data Collection System, and Law Dictionary). Such violation may or may not involve violence, and it may affect individuals or property (school or personal). Although the legislation requires information only on violence in schools, we included nonviolent crimes that research suggests are associated with an undisciplined and unsafe environment. For example, violent crimes on school property include homicides, assaults, and rapes (which also are crimes under public law), as well as more common forms of violent behavior requiring disciplinary action, including bullying and fighting. However, the concept of violence does not cover non-violent school crimes, such as thefts, use and sale of drugs, and weapons possession on school property. While specific acts such as thefts, use of drugs, and carrying weapons to school do not, in and of themselves, constitute violence, they do contribute to an unsafe and undisciplined environment in schools, and the prevalence and incidence of these acts can serve as indicators of school safety and discipline in concrete, measurable terms. For example, research indicates that the use of drugs creates serious educational problems for students, and it is associated with student misbehavior, delinquency, and suicide (Reaching the Goals: Goal 6, 1993). Similarly, other research shows that weapons play a major role in serious crimes. For example, in 1991, 55 percent of a sample of incarcerated, serious juvenile offenders had carried guns all or most of the time prior to incarceration, and another 28 percent had carried guns at least occasionally (Sheley, S., & Wright, J. D.,1995). (This finding does not imply that among students who carry guns, an equally high proportion are likely to become serious juvenile offenders. However, it does show that guns play a large role in juvenile crime.) Therefore, understanding the frequency, seriousness, and incidence of both violent and nonviolent crimes in schools is, in our view, important, as these types of crime are interrelated and pertinent to Goal 6, Safe, Disciplined, and Drug-free Schools, of the Goals 2000 Act. Thus, in order to capture both violent and non-violent phenomena associated with unsafe and undisciplined schools, we defined the scope of work more broadly than is indicated in the legislation. For the purposes of this study, we categorized specific criminal acts as follows': Use or Sale of Drugs: alcohol, marijuana, other illegal drugs, and tobacco. Property Crimes: arson, breaking and entering or burglary, larceny or theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Violent and Personal Crimes: attacks*, battery, bullying*, homicide, kidnapping, robbery, sexual battery, sexual harassment, suicide*, threat or intimidation, \"violent acts.\" Other Behaviors against School Regulations: disorderly conduct, fights, trespassing, verbal insults*, weapons possession. 1 The list of criminal and violent acts was developed by the Crime, Violence, and Discipline Reporting Task Force, National Education Statistics Committee, National Forum on Education Statistics. The starred items (except \"suicide,\" which is not included in the list) are from the surveys we reviewed, and are intended to measure crime in schools. However, in some cases, we could not readily classify the information these items yield under the categories developed by the task force. For example, the term \"attacks\" could be interpreted as referring to battery, or it could be interpreted as referring to a verbal insult. Furthermore, an item measuring \"violent acts\" does not yield information on a specific type of violence."}, {"section_title": "School", "text": "We defined \"school\" as an education institution comprising one or more of grades K through 12, or an education institution providing elementary and secondary education to children ages 5 through 21. \"School property\" includes school buildings, school buses, school grounds, and places that are holding school-sponsored events, even though they are not officially on school grounds."}, {"section_title": "Incidence", "text": "A specific criminal act or offense involving one or more victims and one or more offenders is an \"incident.\" (In some cases, however, the act might involve only one offender and no victims. Such acts might include drug use, weapons possession, and suicide.) \"Incidence\" refers to the number of criminal acts per person or per 100 persons of a given population during a specific period of time. It is based on the total number of incidents occurring in the population during a specific period of time (after National Health Interview Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 1992, Notes). (Incidence can also be defined as the number of incidents per given unit [e.g., a school] during a specific period of time.) The rate of criminal acts (incidence) does not necessarily equal the number of victims or perpetrators of crime within a given period. This is the case because some incidents may involve numerous victims (e.g., two students may be the victims of a robbery) or perpetrators (e.g., several students may be involved in a theft). In other words, the number of incidents may be less than the number of victims or the number of offenders. Incidence can be calculated only if the total number of incidents are reported for the whole unit (e.g., a school) by a single cognizant individual (e.g. the principal). For example, only an individual who keeps track of fights on school grounds would be able to provide an accurate count of such incidents. (Individual, student-survey reports of such incidents would lead to an overcount, as each fight could have involved numerous students, and each student could refer to the same fight in his or her report.) Furthermore, items regarding general respondents' knowledge of incidents of crime or violence against others in the school cannot be utilized in the calculation of incidence, as reports of incidents would tend to depend upon the salience and visibility of events. For example, if an incident involved a student threatening another with a gun with a witness at hand, several respondents might hear (possibly embellished) accounts of the incident and report it in surveys. This situation of multiple reports of the same incident would tend to inflate the estimate of incidence based upon questions about awareness or knowledge of events, even in a sample-based survey."}, {"section_title": "Victimization", "text": "\"Victimization\" refers to the percent of the population directly affected by crime in a given period (after Bastian, L.D. & Taylor, B.M., 1991). This rate is based upon specific information elicited directly from the respondent regarding crimes committed against his or her person, against his or her property, or against an individual bearing a unique relationship to him or her (e.g., a particular child, a particular student, a particular group of students). It is not based upon perceptions and beliefs about, or reactions to, criminal acts. An example of a question eliciting information about victimization is: During the past six months, did anyone steal something from your desk, locker, or some other place at school? (After National Crime Victimization Survey, School Crime Supplement, 1989.) \"Average victimization\" refers to the average number of victimizations per person or per 100 persons victimized, and is based upon the number of crimes experienced by the respondent. An example of a question eliciting information regarding the number of times the respondent has been victimized during a given period is: Has a student attacked you in the past 12 months? How many times? (After Schools and Staffing Survey, 1993-94)."}, {"section_title": "Prevalence", "text": "We defined \"prevalence\" as referring to the percent of the population directly participating in some criminal activity or behavior against school regulations in a given period. The prevalence rate also is based upon specific information elicited directly from the person committing the crime or behavior against school regulations. An example of a question eliciting information on prevalence is: During the past 30 days, on how many days did you carry a weapon such as a gun, on school property? (after Youth Risk liehavior Survey, 1993). \"Average prevalence\" refers to the average number of participations per person or per 100 persons, and is based upon the number of times the respondent participated in a crime or behaviors against school regulations. An example of a question eliciting information regarding the number of times the respondent has participated in a criminal activity during a given period is: During the last 12 months, how often have you damaged school property on purpose? (after Monitoring the Future, 1995)."}, {"section_title": "An Overview of the National Data Reviewed", "text": "We screened several sources of information and reviewed only those surveys and datasets that contain information on crime and violence within the scope of the areas we defined.

The National Household Education Survey is based upon students enrolled in grades 3 through 12. The survey is household-based, and information for students enrolled in grades 3 through 5 is collected from the students' parents.

However, the response categories do not distinguish between school administrators and teachers."}, {"section_title": "Schools", "text": "None of the datasets we reviewed is designed to elicit school-level information on violent and non-violent crime. Two surveys, the National Crime Victimization Survey (and its School Crime Supplement) and the National Household Education Survey, are householdbased, and, therefore, cannot provide school-level estimates of crime and violence. The other surveys are school-based, but designed to collect and reflect teacher-or student-level information. The sampling plans of these surveys are not designed to enable the calculation of school-level estimates. The National Educational Longitudinal Survey in 1988 was designed to be representative of grade 8 students and schools,22 but with a sample size of only about 23 students within each school, the school-level estimates of crime and violence (for grade 8) are likely to have very large standard errors. The 1992 survey was designed to collect information on the NELS cohort of grade 12 students, not to be representative of high schools. (None of the school administrator or teacher surveys elicits any objective, direct information on crime in school.) The Monitoring the Future, the Youth Risk Behavior, and the Metropolitan Life surveys also are based upon student samples clustered within schools. In the case of the Monitoring the Future survey, up to 400 students may be selected from each of about 130 schools, and student information can be aggregated up to the school level. However, schoollevel information calculated through this method would apply only to grades 8, 10, or 12, (whichever is chosen for the survey at a given school). In addition, since the number of schools in the sample is small, inferences based upon the school-level estimates, such as the proportion of schools with high levels of drug use, will have large standard errors. (The information required to connect students to schools is not publicly available; only the researchers responsible for the survey are authorized to conduct such analysis. In the case of the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, although several students (one or two English or social studies classes) are sampled from within each school in the sample, the student-level data cannot be traced back to the school (Dr. Laura Kann, Centers for Disease Control, personal communication). In the case of the Metropolitan Life study, only 52 schools participated in the study, with approximately 23 students in each school. Thus, the school sample and the student sample within each school are too small for estimating reliable school-level statistics. In sum, none of the surveys we reviewed provides information that can be used to estimate school-based rates of non-violent and violent crime. However, it is possible with 22 National Educational Longitudinal Study: 1988. Base year: school component data file user's manual, p.7. several of these datasets to stratify the student or teacher sample by school level (e.g., elementary, middle, and high) and by some other school characteristic (e.g., public and private) in order to estimate the student-level rate of victimization and incidence at those types of schools.

Another example comes from the National Household Education Survey: Do you know of any students or teachers being physically attacked, or involved in fights, during this school year? Did it happen to you this school year? In addition, many of the survey items do not clearly elicit information on whether the student was \"attacked\" or \"threatened,\" and whether the student was attacked with a weapon or without.

For a subset we also examined the responses by background characteristics (household income and urbanicity of residence). Thus, for Monitoring the Future, we used the 1994 data and for the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, we used the 1993 data, since the more recent datasets were not available. We expected the pattern of findings within each dataset to parallel the pattern of findings in the other datasets. For example, within each dataset, we expected a higher percentage of male students to report weapons possession than female students. Thus, this first step allowed us to examine whether the different datasets captured and exhibited the same \"story.\" The pattern of findings was, in general, consistent across datasets and consistent with our expectations. We then performed reliability and validity checks within and across the databases for select items. Our objective was to determine whether the information elicited by these items was consistent both across datasets and complementary with information elicited from other items. We could not conduct reliability checks for most items because of skip patterns in the survey, a lack of similar items within the survey (for inter-item consistency), and a lack of item, sample, and timeframe overlap among surveys. We also reviewed some existing studies to inform our own findings. Below, we discuss the potential issues and problems we have identified with the information in the datasets. General items regarding crime and violence may be subject to wide interpretations. Our analysis suggests that general items such as \"attacks\" and \"bullying\" are likely to be subject to wide interpretations. An example of a general item most likely being interpreted widely comes from the Schools and Staffing Survey. The survey contains questions asking teachers whether or not they have been threatened or attacked by students. A higher percentage of elementary school teachers reported being attacked by students than did secondary school teachers."}, {"section_title": "School Level", "text": "Attacked Percent (95% C.I.)

Another example comes from an analysis of the National Household Education Survey data (Student Victimization at School and Student Strategies to Avoid Harm at School, NCES, October, 1995). Data show that similar percentages of white students (in mostly white schools) and black students (in mostly black schools) report being bullied (8%), physically attacked (3%), and robbed (1%). However, more blacks students in mostly black schools (31%) were likely to stay away from certain places in school than were white students in mostly white schools (13%). These data suggest that the nature of attacks or bullying might be quite different for students in these two types of schools. Questions about behaviors that have occurred during a more recent period of time may elicit more reliable answers. Our analysis indicates that respondents may more accurately recall behaviors that have occurred relatively recently. For example, in the Monitoring the Future study, the percentage of students who indicated they had used alcohol during the last year is close to the that of students who reported they had been under the influence of alcohol during the last four weeks. During last year (Form 1) Percent Use (95% C.I.) Use of alcohol in school 7.8 (\u00b1 2.0)25 Illegal drug use in school 10.8 (\u00b1 2.4) During last four weeks (Form 2) Under the influence of alcohol while at school 6.8 ( 2.0) Under the influence of marijuana/illegal drugs while at school 10.2 (\u00b1 2.4) While the questions are distinct, both questions would apply to students who used alcohol and were under the influence of alcohol in school. The difference is that one question also applies to those students who used alcohol in school, but were not under the influence, and the other question also applies to those who used alcohol outside of school, but came to school under their influence. The questions regarding alcohol use are as follows: Form 1: On how many occasions Of any) have you had alcohol to drink (more than a few sips) ... during the last 12 months? When you used alcohol during the last year, how often did you use it in each of the following situations ?... At school? Form 2: During the last four weeks, on how many days (f any) were you under the influence of alcohol while you were at school? Given the differences in the two populations, the results would imply that many more students use alcohol outside the school and come to school under the influence. However, the questions may not be distinctly interpreted, and the pattern of results may imply that the students who were under the influence of alcohol in the past four weeks are the same as the students who used alcohol during the last year (stated differently, the number of students using alcohol in school does not expand during the course of the year). However, it is quite likely that the number does, in fact, expand, but students tend to remember only relatively recent uses of alcohol. A third explanation is that the same students respond positively to both items, regardless of when they have used alcohol or drugs. The medium of data-collection influences student responses to sensitive questions. We compared responses to some items on the National Household Education Survey (NHES) with responses to similar items on the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), since both surveys cover high school students and were conducted during approximately the same time period. The percentage of students in grades 9 through 12 reporting carrying weapons to schools is higher in the YRBS26 than it is in the NHES. 27 While 11.8 (\u00b11.4) percent of the YRBS sample reported carrying a weapon to school in the last 30 days, only 4.4 (\u00b11.0) percent of the 9 through 12 grade NHES sample reported doing so this school year. In addition, while 16.2 (\u00b11.2) percent of the YRBS sample indicated being in a physical fight on school property during the last 12 months, only 2.8 (\u00b1.8) percent of the 9 through 12 grade sample in the NHES reported being physically attacked or involved in fights during this school year. The questions in the surveys are phrased as follows: NHES: (Have you heard/Do you know) of any students or teachers being physically attacked, or involved in fights, during this school year? Did it happen to you this school year? YRBS: During the past 12 months, how many times were you involved in a physical fight on school property? Although the two questions capture slightly different time periods, the NHES responses would be expected to be higher, since the latter part of the NHES question is phrased to tap into both attacks and fights experienced by the respondent. Similarly, 7.3 (\u00b1 0.9) percent of the YRBS respondents indicated being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property, but about 1 percent (\u00b10.5) of the 9 through 12 grade NHES students reported having things taken from them by force and about 3 percent (L0.8) indicated that they were attacked or involved in fights. This is an unexpected finding. The percentage of students reporting being threatened or injured with a weapon would be expected to be lower than the percentage of students reporting being forced, attacked, or involved in fights, since fighting is generally expected to be more commonplace on school grounds than is being threatened with a weapon. Students' responses in the two surveys were possibly influenced by survey methodology, causing differences in the obtained results. The YRBS sample completed a self-administered survey in school from February through May, 1993, and the NHES sample was interviewed at home, over the telephone, from January through April, 1993. Low interrater reliability regarding criminal victimization. In the NHES, both 6 through 12 grade students and their parents reported crime and violence experienced by the students. Counterintuitively, victimization rates based on parents' responses are higher than those based on students' responses. The percentages of parents and students indicating that students had been victimized by various types of crimes are as follows: Rates of Victimization (95% C.I.) Although students are likely to be the best reporters of their own experiences of crime, it is possible that they underreport crimes to strangers."}, {"section_title": "Parents", "text": "In addition to the discrepancies in the overall rates, there is little overlap between students' reports of victimization and parents' reports of their children's victimization. For example, among students who reported having had things taken by force, only 24 percent of their parents reported the same crime. Conversely, among parents who reported that their children had something taken by force, only 13 percent of their children reported the same crime. (See Appendix B, Table 1). In this case, the correlation between parents' responses and students' responses is quite low (r=.15, p<.001). Similarly, among students who reported being attacked or in a fight, 25 percent of their parents also reported the incidents; among parents who reported that their children were attacked or in a fight, only 19 percent of their children also reported the incidents (r=.2, p<.001). These results suggest that both students and parents may be exercising selective recall in reporting crime and violence, or they may be conceptualizing the terms differently from one another. The method of eliciting information influences the respondents' answers."}, {"section_title": "p p", "text": "We compared responses to the School Crime Supplement (SCS) with response to the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), and found that the responses on the SCS are not consistent with the responses on the NCVS. Overall, the violent crime victimization rate based on the SCS is 1.6 percent, and on the NCVS it is 2.2 percent. The crosstabulations between responses to the primary instrument and responses to the supplement exhibit little overlap (see Appendix B, Table 2). For example, only 31 percent of the respondents indicating a violent crime on the NCVS also reported it on the SCS. Conversely, only 36 percent reporting robberies or attacks on the SCS also reported such incidents on the NCVS. The correlation between responses on the two surveys is quite low (r=.34, p< .001). This is a surprising finding, since the NCVS was administered before the SCS, which prompted the respondents to remember the crimes they had reported on the NCVS. While it is the case that the items in the two surveys are constructed and worded quite differently, and while some discrepancies are inevitable, positive SCS responses (i.e., \"yes\" to questions regarding victimization) would be expected to be a subset of positive NCVS responses, since the NCVS questions were more detailed and contained more probes than did the SCS questions. This finding reveals the subjectivity involved in interpreting questions about crime and victimization."}, {"section_title": "a a", "text": "The structure of the response categories may yield low estimates of mean number of victimizations and participations. Five of the eight surveys reviewed provide information on the average number of victimizations or participations per person or per 100 persons. These surveys include: Monitoring the Future, Youth Risk Behavior Survey, the National Crime Victimization Survey and its School Crime Supplement, and the Schools and Staffing Survey. In the case of Monitoring the Future and the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, the calculation of the mean number of victimizations or participations is artificially constrained. The items in those surveys provide response categories, and the top response category is bounded by an upper limit. For example, in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, one question asks: During the past 30 days, on how many days did you carry a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club on school property? The response categories provided for this question are: \"0 days,\" \"1 day,\" \"2 or 3 days,\" \"4 or 5 days,\" \"6 or more days.\" In this case, the top response would be coded as 6, 7, or 8, in order to calculate the mean number of times (i.e., days) a student carried a weapon to school. Thus, this number is likely to be an underestimate. Items in the National Crime Victimization Survey and its School Crime Supplement, and the Schools and Staffing Survey elicit free responses, thus providing more accurate information for estimating the mean number of victimizations or participations. Another potential problem with the data is that, for some crimes, average victimizations or participations can be determined for a period spanning one month, while for others it is over a 12 month period or over the school year, thus yielding incomparable results. (This problem also is true for rates of victimization and prevalence.) Collectively, our findings suggest the need for revising the items and for developing a more rigorous method of data collection on crime and violence in schools."}, {"section_title": "Data Available for Report to Congress", "text": "Based upon our review of the databases, we suggest that the datasets listed below be utilized to develop the report to Congress.

Nonetheless, the databases listed below can begin to provide an initial view into the problem of crime and violence in schools: The data from the first two surveys will become available by May of 1997, and the data from the latter three surveys currently are available. We suggest including information from the 1994 Schools and Staffing Survey and the 1993 Metropolitan Life survey even though it will have become dated by the time the report is produced as there is a dearth of information on crime and violence experienced by teachers. (Teachers constitute a significant portion of the school population, and not providing information on their experiences would miss a large part of the picture.) These two surveys contain some information on teacher victimization, even though the information is limited and superficial. In addition, the Metropolitan Life survey asks teachers whether they have ever brought something to school for their protection, including knives and guns. Although this information is not elicited for a given time period, it would parallel the information provided by students, and it would provide insights into what teachers do in order to protect themselves in what they perceive to be an unsafe environment. We suggest not using the National Educational Longitudinal Study (1988,1990,1992), as it contains no information that is not already available in more recent databases. Similarly, most information in the National Household Education Survey (1993) is available in the more recent datasets. Although the National Household Education Survey does contain information on students in grades three through five (a population not represented in the datasets we have recommended), the information is given by parents, not by students. Given that the interrater reliability between parents and students responses is low, we suggest using this information with caution."}, {"section_title": "Information Available through the Recommended Databases", "text": "Below, we discuss the information that will be available through the databases. Tables 9 to 12 provide an overview of the information available, the school populations represented, and the type of information available. The information can, in most cases, be broken down by respondents' (students and teachers) personal characteristics, including gender and ethnicity, background characteristics, including household income level and region or urbanicity of the respondent's residence, and whether the school is public or private. The Monitoring the Future and the Youth Risk Behavior Surveys collectively provide information on student drug-use and students' experience of being offered drugs in school. The information, however, is restricted to students enrolled in grades 8 through 12. Using these databases, the percentage of students in grades 8 through 12 who used drugs and were offered drugs for sale, and average drug use can be estimated.

The NCVS provides information on victimization of individuals ages 12 and above due to thefts and, specifically, motor vehicle thefts on school property. The SCS, MTF, and the YRBS collectively provide information on student victimization for students enrolled in grades 6 through 12. The National Crime Victimization survey, supplemented with information from the SCS, can provide fairly detailed information on victimization, grades 6 through 12, from violent crimes that are not restricted to the list given above, including attempted rape and rape, and attempted and completed robberies, with or without injuries. In addition, the NCVS provides information on victimization of adults on school property.

The missing pieces include student samples from Kindergarten through grade 5, information from teachers regarding their own drug or alcohol use on school premises, and detailed information on teacher and school staff victimization. Even though the NCVS identifies the employment category of victims, it does not distinguish between teachers, administrators, and other staff. In addition, at present, there is very little information available on the proportion of students who participate, within any given period, in criminal or against-regulations behaviors, including stealing, injuring others, and destroying school property. Furthermore, the report cannot provide information on homicides, attempted or completed suicides, and kidnappings for any school population. Apart from information on school populations, the report cannot contain information on victimization and incidence with the school as the unit of analysis. Thus, for example, it will not contain information on the percentage of schools in the nation that are home to high levels of crime and violence. Finally, the report can provide only limited state-level information on teacher victimization through SASS, and a range of information for 24 states, on high school students, through YRBS. Despite these drawbacks, a report to Congress can provide a first, relatively comprehensive picture of violent and non-violent crime in schools. It can provide information on crime victimization, rates of participation in against-regulations activities, and the average number of victimizations and participations, since the data are from respondents' reports of their own experiences and behaviors, not upon their perceptions of crime and violence in schools. However, it cannot provide information on the incidence of violent and non-violent crimes in schools, as no surveys simultaneously measure the incident, the number of individuals victimized, and the number of perpetrators of crime. A potential strength of the report to Congress could be the provision of information based upon a rigorous assessment of the quality of the data. There is considerable overlap in the populations represented in the MTF, SCS, and YRBS surveys, all three of which were conducted over roughly the same period of time. Thus, responses to items that are similar across datasets can be examined to assess the reliability and validity of those items. If a similar item generates different results across datasets, the results will be less believable, but the information will form the basis for further investigation."}, {"section_title": "General Recommendations for Future Surveys", "text": "Based upon our review, we suggest that NCES design a survey (or system of surveys) to collect comprehensive and detailed information on crime and violence in schools. For this survey, we recommend taking the steps to design features outlined below. 1. Develop survey items that probe in detail the nature of the crime or violence experienced by the respondents. The redesigned National Crime Victimization Survey can serve as an example of the kinds of items required to elicit information on crime and violence experienced by survey respondents. 2. Design items to elicit information on only one type of crime, or only one aspect of one type of crime. 3. Build in item reliability checks, such as including questions about the same incidents occurring over two different time periods, one of which is a subset of the first, and design questionnaires without skip patterns. 4. Design free response formats to capture more accurately the number of times the respondent has been victimized or has participated in some unlawful activity, and use randomized response techniques. 5. For significant yet relatively rare crimes, such as rapes, attempted and completed suicides, attempted and completed murders, and kidnappings, include a survey for a school-level respondent who would provide information on the school as a whole. 6. Design survey items to obtain information on incidents, including number of individuals victimized and number of individuals participating in the criminal activity. 7. Develop a stratified school sample, with a sufficiently large student sample within each school, to enable the calculation of school-level estimates. The student and teacher sample clusters within each school must be large enough to develop reliable school-level estimates for victimization and against-regulations behaviors not readily known by school authorities. The Fast Response Survey System and the Schools and Staffing Survey also could be designed to include some key items on crime and violence in schools."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions", "text": "The National Center for Education Statistics is Congressionally mandated to produce a report on violence in schools. Data from some recently conducted surveys can be used to satisfy this legislation. These surveys include Monitoring the Future (1995), National Crime Victimization and its School Crime Supplement (1995), Youth Risk Behavior Survey (1995), Schools and Staffing Survey (1994), and the Metropolitan Life Survey of the American Teacher (1993). The first three surveys contain information on student drug-and alcoholuse, victimization due to property and violent crimes, participation in fights, and possession of weapons on school grounds. The information is restricted to students in grades 8-12 for drug-use, grades 6-12 for victimization due to property or violent crimes, and grades 8-12 for participation in fights and carrying weapons to schools. The Schools and Staffing and the Metropolitan Life surveys include information on teacher victimization and possession of weapons on school property, and the National Crime Victimization Survey includes information of victimization of school employees. Collectively the surveys provide a relatively large picture of the extent of crime, violence, and other against-regulations behaviors in schools. However, significant pieces of the picture remain missing. Students in grades K through 5 are not included in the samples, and little specific information is available on teachers and administrative staff. In addition, school-level prevalence of crime cannot be estimated using these data, since the surveys were not designed to collect school-based information. More significantly, some of the results from these surveys might be unreliable due to the construction of the survey items. Some items are phrased in general terms and, therefore, are subject to wide interpretation. Other items elicit information spanning a relatively long period of time, and respondents may not accurately recall the information elicited by the item. These issues imply that a rigorous assessment of the quality of the data will be essential, prior to developing a report to Congress. For the future, we recommend that NCES develop a survey system focused upon school crime and violence, in order to collect comprehensive information on student-level, teacher-level, and school-level violence. The development of this system will require the construction of items that discriminate among different types of non-violent and violent crimes, and against-regulations behaviors.
