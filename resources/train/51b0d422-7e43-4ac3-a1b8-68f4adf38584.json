However, in some occupations that demand more high skilled labor such as information technology (IT), engineering and computer sciences, IV estimates indicate no negative wage effect on the U.S natives. O n u r A R S L A N | 3"}, {"section_title": "1-Introduction", "text": "The H-1B is a type of visa which allows companies and employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations in the United States. According to regulations, specialty occupations are defined as highly specialized knowledge in human files such as, engineering, biotechnology, mathematics, physical sciences, social sciences, architecture, medicine and health, education, law, accounting, business specialties, theology, and the arts, and requiring the attainment of a bachelor's degree or its equivalent as a minimum level of education with the exception of fashion models. The process takes approximately a year from submitting files to the Department of Labor to issuing visa by the U.S embassy or consulate abroad. In the last few years there has been a substantial increase in the H-1B visa applications in the United States. According to the Bureau of Consular Affairs, applications for H-1B visa increased nearly three times from 2000 to 2010. At the same time, number of approved H-1B visa applications raised from 45.000 to over 100.000 in a yearly base. Based on the report released by the U.S Department of Labor, there are about 450.000 foreign born high skilled workers who have H-1B temporary work visa. This outstanding increase in the supply of high skilled foreign born workers might have a significant impact on the wages of high skilled U.S born native workers. Total number of high skilled immigrants is controlled by the immigration department and skilled immigrants' inflow is restricted by the policies. Even thought, demand for high skilled immigrants has been increased over the years, policies and restrictions on skilled immigrants haven't been faced a significant change. Last ten years, a serious debate has been going on between companies and government about the restrictions on skilled immigrants. On the one hand, companies that demand skilled labor force like information technologies (IT) lobby the government to increase the gap for temporary work visa (H-1B) in order to hire more qualified immigrants. These companies claim that there is a shortage of high skilled native born labor force in the labor market. On the other side, after the great economic recession in 2008, the new economic stimulus plan signed by President Barack Obama requires banks to give hiring priority to U.S born native workers over temporary H-1B visa holders. These policy changes regarding to high skilled migration program have significant implications on the U.S economy and labor market. There are O n u r A R S L A N | 4 number of studies that look at the effects of high skilled immigrants on productivity and innovation in the U.S. 1 But there is little known about the wage consequences of H-1B visa program. The main objective of this thesis is whether non-immigrant temporary workers (H-1B visa holders) depress real wages of U.S born high skilled native workers or not. This question has raised debates in the political and academic arenas especially after the great economic recession in 2008. With nearly half a million temporary H-1B visa holders working in high skilled oriented jobs in the United States, the impacts of non-immigrant H-1B labor force on the U.S labor market is one of the most important political and economical debated issues in contemporary immigration policy. The main reason for that, immigration has a positive impact on labor supply side. It increases the supply of labor force and it is generally claimed that increase in labor supply will decrease wages and make jobs more scare for natives. Competition for highly paid skilled jobs between natives and nonimmigrants (H1-B holders) has been getting more intense since the H-1B visa program started. The latest report from National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics indicates that there are about 12.4 million individuals classified as engineers and scientists in the U.S as of January 2011. Nearly 5.4 million persons out of 12.4 were directly employed in science and engineering occupations and 7 million individuals were employed science and engineering related occupations. The same report finds out that around 550 thousand individuals which are approximately 11 percent of all engineers and scientists are non-US citizen temporary residents who have temporary work visa (H-1B). 2 Additionally, as indicated chart 1 above, high skilled non-immigrant share has been increasing every year by the extension of H-1B visa approval. Consequently, the H-1B visa program might have important implications on the United States labor market. Increase in the number of visa approved (gap extension) provides more high skilled workers available for the companies. However, there is limited information on how high skilled non-immigrants workers affect wages of native workers in the labor market. So, this paper aims to analyze the effect of H-1B visa program on natives' wages by 1 Hunt and Louselle (2008) analyze innovation behavior by focusing on foreign born scientists and engineers. In addition, other authors such as Kahn (2007), Ginther (2008), and MacGarvie (2010) examine the affects of high skilled immigrants on productivity. 2 Non-US born permanent residents (green card holders) are excluded in this statistical ratio calculation. O n u r A R S L A N | 5 using the general equilibrium approach. While the previous researchers use the data from 1993 to 2006, I use the latest available data including 2010 Science and Engineering Statistical Database. Another difference is that I use state dummy variables to measure the local effects of high skilled non-immigrant influx on the wages. In addition to the constant elasticity of substitution (CES) model, I use Borjas Index to calculate elasticity between high skilled non-immigrant and native workers. Based on findings from CES model and Borjas Index, I can reject the alternative hypothesis that high skilled non-immigrant and native workers are not perfect substitutes. In other words, H-1B holders and natives are perfect substitutes in the same experience and educational level. I also use instrumental variable (IV) approach to estimate individual-level effects and find out that H-1B holders have little but statistically negative impact on the wages on native workers in the same occupation. This finding is also consistent with the hypothesis test result."}, {"section_title": "2-Literature Review", "text": "This issue of immigration and wages is controversial and has attracted significant amounts of study, often leading to wildly differing conclusions. Some research has documented only small effects on wages (Card, 2001) and some have found negative effects (Borjas, Freeman, Katz, 1997) or positive effects (Friedberg, 2001). There is some consensus about long-run effects are controversial but there may be some negative short-run effects on wages for fixed capital (Borjas, 1995 and but with a positive effect on return to capital due to complementarities between factors. There has also been work done focusing on the effects of immigration on relative wages, particularly comparing different levels of education, with Borjas arguing that less educated workers are more sensitive to wage effects (Borjas, Freeman, Katz, 1997). However there are disagreements on the magnitude of that effect with some claiming that the pressure on wages is smaller and possibly insignificant (Card, 2001). With this in mind it is obvious that we still have a long way to go. There is much left to be said about the matter of immigration and its effect on the economy and we have only barely scratched the surface of this topic. Some papers regarding with the impact of immigration on the wages of natives use very complex approaches in order to distinguish their study from others. However, most of O n u r A R S L A N | 6 the papers related with this topic take usually one of the two main approaches to estimate the regressions. The first approach is the general equilibrium (national) approach which simply depends on a Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) production function and calculates the elasticity of substitution among natives and immigrants. As a next step, the researchers run simulation to find out the wage effect of immigration on different groups of native workers by using that elasticity coefficient. Second approach is the area studies approach which examines the impact of the immigration in one area and its effect on the local economy. In this approach, the researchers use reduced form estimations instead of measuring the elasticity of substitution, so that they can study the correlation between the increased number of immigrants in one location and wages in the same location. Camarota (1998) uses general equilibrium approach in order to study the effects of immigration on the low skilled labor market. His study employs a log-linear regression model including 12 control variables such as the level of experience, the level of unionization, education, age, gender and etc. In order to avoid the problems associated with cross city comparison (area studies), his empirical method measures the effects of immigration directly comparing the real wages between natives and immigrants in the same area and industry. According to regression equations, the researchers indicate that immigrants have a negative impact on both weekly and hourly wages of natives. In addition, he states that increase in immigration has decreased the average wages of native in low skilled occupations by nearly 12 percent. However, the study concludes that the effects of immigration on wages are relatively small when all natives considered together. 3 Furthermore, overall effects of immigration on wages are statistically not significant for higher skilled occupations. Peri and Ottaviano (2010) analyze the effects of immigration on the wages of U.S born natives by using the national approach. He uses two different steps to calculate effects of immigration on the wages. The first step is to calculate elasticity of substitution among different groups of workers. As a second step, the authors estimate the total wage effects of immigration on U.S born natives by using the underlying production function and the estimated elasticity. The researchers find that there is a small but significant level of O n u r A R S L A N | 7 imperfect substitution between immigrant and native workers. Moreover, according to the estimated elasticity analysis, the study shows that in the short run, immigration has a minor effect (between -0.1% and 0.6 %) on the wages of native workers with no high school diploma. However, immigration effect on average native wages is significant and positive (+0.6%) in the long run. A similar approach used by Orrenius and Zavodny (2006) in order to examine the effects of immigration on low-skilled and high-skilled oriented occupations by using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). The researchers especially focus on differential effects by skill level and use occupation as a proxy for skill. They find that the total wage effects are -0.43, -0.82, and -5.15 percent for professional, service, and manual workers, respectively. Additionally, the paper suggests that flows of new legal immigrants have very small negative impacts on the wages of U.S born native workers, but highly statistically significant and concentrated among low-skill occupations. For this group, wages are about 8% to 10% lower as a result of the increase in the share of workers who are new immigrants. Furthermore, the authors didn't find evidence of adverse wage impacts on medium and high skilled native workers. In fact, increases in the newly arriving immigrant share of workers within professional jobs actually have positive wage effects, \"suggesting that there may be complementarities between native workers and newly arrived immigrants in the top skill categories\" (Madeline, 2006). Although, most previous studies of the effect of immigration on wages use a crossarea approach that compares the number of immigrants in an area with wages within area, this study (Orrenius and Zavodny, 2006) offers different approach by using INS database. The INS data contains a complete count of new legal immigrants and allows them to distinguish between newly arriving immigrants and those who adjust status while already in the U.S. In addition, they use several years of data from 2000 to 2005 whereas most previous cross-area and occupation-level studies relied on a cross-sectional approach. Even though, the INS data list 25 different occupations, which are more detailed for skilled workers and unskilled workers, the researchers organize occupations under three diverse groups which are professionals, service workers and manual laborers. In addition, CPS data includes all new lawful permanent residents aged 16-64 who report an occupation. The study indicates that immigration inflows can negatively or positively impact natives' wages, depending on the degree of substitution or complementary between immigrant and native workers. The degree of substitution between immigrants and natives is a main determinant of the effect of immigration on native wages. In order to determine these effects they use a simple model from labor economics. \"Holding capital constant and assuming constant returns to scale production technology, an increase in labor supply due to immigration will lower wages if immigrants and natives are substitutes and labor supply is not perfectly elastic with respect to wages\" (Borjas, 2003). Furthermore, the magnitude of the negative effect increases with the degree of substitution between the immigrants and natives and with the size of the immigrant inflow. In the immigration literature, most of the empirical studies with regard to immigration effect on native wages focus on low skilled workers and minimum wage offered occupations. However, there are a few studies that specifically analyze the effect of high skill immigrants. One of the studies by Borjas (2007) analyzes the effects of foreign students on the earnings of doctorate degrees. The researcher develops an alternative approach which can be used to directly estimate the factor price elasticity instead of estimating the generic recession (national approach) model to determine relation between the wage of native and immigrant worker. 4 Using database from the Survey of Doctoral Recipients (SDR) and the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED), the study shows that the foreign student influx in the U.S collages might have a significant impact in the labor market on high skill native workers. The empirical analysis reports that foreign students' share in the earning of doctorate degrees increase sharply from 11.3 percent to 24.4 percent between 1992 and 2002. Moreover, in the year 2002, international students received 36.5 percent of all doctorates awarded in physical science, 50.7 percent of doctorates awarded in engineering and 25.7 percent of doctorates awarded in life sciences. According to estimation results, a 10 percent increase in the supply of doctorate degree earned by foreign students decreases the earnings of doctorate by around 3 to 4 percent for native students. Furthermore, the study finds out that constant increase in the number of doctorate received by foreign students has reduced economic opportunities for natives and it can be a significant factor to drive native students to other PhD programs to | 9 avoid foreigners. Therefore, this study points that U.S born undergraduates are motivated to pursue their professional occupations to fields that haven't been targeted by foreign students. Another study by Huang and Hsueh (2009) examine the impact of high skilled immigrants on the U.S born native wages. Similar to Borjas (2007), the researchers use national approach which relies on elasticity estimation between natives and immigrants by using the Scientist and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTA). In addition to the elasticity estimation, individual level instrumental variable regressions are estimated in order to calculate effects of immigration influx on wages of natives. For more detail analysis, they split the sample into two separate categories as young workers who are under 45 and older workers who are over 45. According to least square estimates, the study indicates that high skilled immigration influx in the United States has adverse effect on the earnings of high skilled native workers. Increase in the ratio of immigrants to natives by ten percent reduces the wage of older natives by 3.4 to 4.8 percent. In addition, the effect of immigration on the wages is greater among the young native workers and it lowers the average wages of young natives by 7.6 percent. The empirical results suggest that there is an intense competition between young native and immigrant workers terms of lending highly paid occupations in Science and Engendering fields. This study also provides geographic information about immigrants. Based on analysis by driving the sample geographically, the study shows that immigrants are more concentrated on the coast areas, especially West Coast and East Coast. Weighted percentage of the immigrants is 16.9 percent in the areas located on the coasts, however weighed percentage drops to 10.3 percent in the areas located in the South and Midwest. 5 Further to point, the Individual Variable (IV) analysis indicates that the effect of the immigration on native wages is negative both in the center part and on the coasts of the United States. The immigration influx reduced average wages of natives by 2.5 percent on the coast areas and 4.4 percent in the center regions. These results reported that negative effect of high skilled immigrants has small geographic differences, which is consistent with the idea that labor market for highly educated workers is national because high skilled workers have more mobility relative the less educated workers. In conclusion, all these indicators tell us that the degree of substitution between immigrants and natives is likely to vary across skill levels and over time. Wage effects O n u r A R S L A N | 10 generally become more negative as skill levels decrease and become more positive as immigrants' time in the U.S. increases. Substitution is likely to be easier in industries with less skilled workers because employees are more interchangeable and training costs are lower than in industries with skilled workers. In skilled jobs, the need for English language proficiency and institutional knowledge may make it difficult for employers to substitute immigrants for native workers. However, majority of the studies claim that there is a perfect substitution between highly skilled foreign born immigrant and U.S born native workers in the same occupation."}, {"section_title": "3-Data Description and Descriptive Statistics", "text": "For this research paper, the primary database will be the Science and Engineers Statistical Data System (SEDS) and Labor Certification Applications (LCA). The time window for the database will be 2001 through 2011. The main reason for this specific timeslot is to make sure having constant publications for these separate datasets 6 . The Department of Labor has some earlier publications about the LCA files, but it doesn't give us enough information to run regression analysis. The SEDS dataset is a longitudinal database that is a combination of three biennial surveys which are the National Survey of Recent College Graduates, the National Survey of College Graduates, and the Survey of Doctorate Precipitins. The Advantage of these surveys is to have specific information on individuals' educational background in three highest degrees (Bachelors, Masters and Doctorate) including the fields of major and specialization. Moreover, it is possible to know respondent's work activity on the job along with level of experience in the occupation. Therefore, the SEDS dataset is preferred to be used for this study due to providing quality and detailed information about non-immigrant and native individuals. Information of this detail and quality is not provided in other databases. The National Survey of College Graduates has been available since 1993. However, in this study, in order to match timeline with the other dataset (LCA), the NSCG in 2001NSCG in , 2003NSCG in , 2006NSCG in , 2008  Due to detailed information on citizenship status, it is easy to identify foreign born high skilled individuals who have H-1B temporary work permits. In this study, part time and self employed individuals are excluded from the sample. Additional restrictions applied on the age. Therefore, the sample includes only individuals who are between 23 and 75 years old. Respondents with missing citizenship information and individuals who don't report their annual salary are excluded from the sample. 9 In this study, I restrict the analysis to individuals who received bachelor's degree or higher degree and employed in Engineering and Science oriented occupations between 2001 7 After 2001, The National Survey of College Graduates cover only 12 to 14 million individuals in Science and Engineering related majors. 8 The SEDS database follows the individuals over the time if they decide to pursue higher education. For example, if any college graduates with the bachelor's degree decide to do master's education, they are followed by the next NSRCG survey. 9 This restriction on annual earning and citizenship status eliminates nearly 8446 respondents which are approximately 2.03% of the full sample. Database don't collect data which specifically clarifies the type of visa that a foreign born individual has in order to enter country legally, it contains information about visa status of foreigners when they came to the U.S. Therefore, I use three different variables which are citizenship status, birth place and visa status (visa status of foreign individuals) in order to identify individuals who have temporary work visa (H-1B). First of all, by using the \"citizenship status\" variable provided in the database, citizenship status of a person can be identified as a native born citizen (born in the U.S and U.S territories), a naturalized citizen (a foreign citizen has a permanent residency) and noncitizen (individuals who have temporary visa). Moreover, another variable which is called \"birth region status\" can be used to determine individual's birth place. The variable provides information as U.S born (born in the U.S and U.S territories), non-U.S born (foreign born) and logical skip (individuals who skip the question in the survey). As a third control mechanism, \"visa status\" variable helps us to track permanent U.S resident visa holders, temporary resident visa holders (temporary resident visa for study or training) and other temporary visa holders such as J1 visa which gives the visa holders to legally work and travel in the United States for less than 6 months visitation. Throughout the analysis in this paper, I describe a \"non-immigrant\" to be a foreign born individual who is holding a H-1B temporary work visa. Because, only foreign born individuals who have bachelor's or higher degree are qualified to apply for temporary work visa (H-1B) prior to their graduation. Therefore, even though the SEDS doesn't include any data for type of visa that is issued by the U.S embassies for non-citizen foreign born individuals, by using these three variables (selecting \"non-citizen\", \"foreign born\" and \"temporary resident visa for study or training\") we can identify non-immigrant H-1B visa holders working in Engineering and Science fields. There are other fields where a non-immigrant individual can legally work with H-1B visa such as agricultures, art, history, language, etc. However, their portion in the H-1B visa applications is about 7 percent which is very small compare to the volume of applications for Engineering and Science related jobs. 10 Furthermore, as indicated in the introduction, this study only focuses on the effects of non-immigrants (H-1B visa holders) on the wages of natives in E&S related fields. Therefore, I excluded individuals who work in other fields beside E&S.   The ratio increased as much as two times in one decade from 0.075 to 0.158. However, the table finds out interesting results in year 2008 and shows that the ratio of non-immigrants to natives has similar values with the previous year's (2006) ratio findings. We don't observe significant increase in the ratio for any occupation cell in that particular year. This situation might occur due to 2008 financial crisis in the U.S. Because during the economic recession, many companies laid off employees regardless of their status. Therefore, one would expect that economic crisis has a downward pressure on hiring H-1B visa holders. Another indication of this case, since H-1B visa program started, the United States Department of Labor has always received more applications than official gap for H-1B visa except the year 2008. The first time in H-1B visa program, the number of total applications stayed under the official number of visas that are supposed to be issued. Therefore, due to weak demand, The Department of Labor extended the deadline for the applications to draw more high skilled foreign workers. The following years, especially in 2010 the ratio increased significantly in computer, engineering, biological and health related occupations. It is important to emphasize that not all of the non-immigrants who received their degree from U.S Universities will directly effect to labor marker in the United States. Some of these newly graduated foreign born individuals who have student visa (F-1) prefer to return their home countries at the end of their education in the U.S. However, it turns out that the vast majority of international students intend to stay it the U.S regardless of their visa O n u r A R S L A N | 16 status at the time they receive their degree. As indicated earlier, the SES database doesn't report individual's visa status at the time the degree was awarded. But, The SESD asks the newly graduated foreign born students if they intend to work or live in the United States after graduation. Over 87 percent of respondents who have student visa (F-1) tend to remain in the U.S. by having a temporary work visa (H-1B). In sum, the H-1B visa program for foreign born high skilled individuals has an influence on the U.S labor marker. By using the data in SESD which gives us information on whether the international student intends to stay in the U.S. prior to degree granted, an alternative measurement of the non-immigrant labor supply can be calculated in order to estimate the trend of foreign born students who actually stayed in the U.S."}, {"section_title": "\u123a\u123b", "text": "\nConsider the aggregate production function for a labor market at time t is given by a CES production model: In the equation four, Y represents total output, K gives aggregate capital input and L gives aggregate labor input.

In the total sample, the both OLS and IV coefficients are not statistically significant across the four specifications. Similar to findings based on the total labor market in Hsueh and Huang (2009), the parameter estimates (\u0d46 \u08d4 ) in this regression analysis are robust to small changes in sampling methods. The second sample of the table 3 reports the parameter estimates for only male non-immigrant and native workers. The ordinary least square coefficients are not statistically significant except the fourth specification which is only significant at the 5 percent level (sample 2, row 1 and column 4). Similarly, instrumental variable estimations are only statistically significant under the fourth specification. Therefore, the inverse elasticity of substitution is sensitive to the choice of sampling and specifications methods. The regression results indicate the null hypothesis that non-immigrant and native male are perfect substitutes cannot be rejected in the male sample. However, based on specification (4) and (5), there may be very weak imperfect substitution between H-1B holder and U.S born men. The last sample of table 3 presents estimated coefficients for non-immigrant and native female by using OLS and IV methods.

Empirical studies using the general equilibrium approach generally don't explain which set of specifications is the most accurate in capturing relative demand shocks. 15 Based on richer set of fixed effects, the table suggests that there may be imperfect substitution between female non-immigrants and natives.

That's an indication that non-immigrant workers are drawn to highly paid occupations. Thus, wage consequences of non-immigrant influx on natives in these occupations can be negative. In other words, increase in the share of non-immigrant workers over native workers in a particular occupation may reduce wages of natives employed in that specific job.

The most of the studies with regard to immigration influx on natives' wages generally used the stock of immigrants as an instrument in the lecture. 16 For instance, in O n u r A R S L A N | 27 these studies the authors assume that there is a correlation between immigrants in the previous period and the current period. They simply believe that new coming immigrants generally follow other experienced immigrants. However, this argument is not valid in the sense that as an instrument the stock of immigrants in the last period can be correlated with the wages in this period. Another exogenous variation with regard to the entry of non-immigrants into an occupation can be determined from non-immigrants level of education in a field related to occupation which is relevant to that particular education. For instance, a high skilled nonimmigrant with a bachelor's degree in a field is likely to work in the relevant occupation which requires that specific education. Therefore, I examine the total number of non- "}, {"section_title": "6-Least Square (LS) and Individual Variable (IV) Estimates", "text": "In order to analyze the impact of high skilled non-immigrant workers in science and engineering fields on the wages of their native counterparts, I use the pooled Science and  (Column 1 to 4). These estimates suggest a negative correlation between the ratio of H-1B holders to natives in occupation c and the wages of natives in the same occupation. The coefficient of \u07da \u0b35 is ranging from -0.496 to -0.645 and it is statistically significant in both specifications. The Negative coefficient value means that a ten percent increase in the ratio of H-1B holders to natives decreases the wages of native workers by 4.96 to 6.45 percent in corresponding occupations. The magnitude of the negative impact is slightly higher than  and Borjas (2007)  shows that the instrument used in this analysis is not weak.

The correlation output finds that the instrumental variable is highly correlated with the corresponding endogenous variable in this regression model. 18 The table 4 also displays estimated coefficients for individuals' highest degree earned (row 4, 5 and 6). It is not surprising to see that each of the educational variables contains positive coefficient values with the 1 percent significance level. Increase in the level of education has positive impact on the wages of natives. Therefore, it is observed that coefficient values raises depending on the type of advanced degree awarded. For instance, having master's degree as a highest education has a positive impact on wages by 1.8 to 1.9 O n u r A R S L A N | 30 percent. Similarly, holding a doctorate degree boosts wages by 3.6 to 4.1 percent, and professional degree holders have statistical positive impact on wage rates by 5.7 to 6.1 percent.

The instrumental variable regression results also suggest that increase in non-immigrant labor supply has no significant effect on wages in these occupations. The results indicate that non-immigrant influx by the H-1B visa increase statistically has no significant negative impact on natives' wages. Both LS and IV regression results show positive coefficients raging from 0.124 to 0.286 in the sample 1. These results can be interrupted as ten percent increase in the ratio of H-1B holders to natives increases the wages of natives by 1.24 to 2.86 percent. In addition, the second estimated variable (the ratio of H-1B holders to natives BA/BS in field c) are statistically significant and shows positive coefficient values which means that the relative supply of non-immigrant bachelor's degree holders in IT related fields is positively correlated with the relative supply of H-1B workers in the same occupation (column 2 and 4). These findings are consistent with the results in Zavodny (2003) and Lincoln and Kerr (2010).  "}, {"section_title": "B) Effects of Gender", "text": "As a next step, I examine the sample by gender to determine elasticity of substitution effect on the wages. As indicated in the previous table (table 3)  The second sample displays coefficients for female H-1B holders and natives by using the same specification in sample 1. The ordinary least square and instrumental variable estimations are negative similar to first sample. However, the magnitude of the impact is much smaller than male sample which is lowest -0.112 and highest -0.275. These estimates indicate adverse wage effects of increased non-immigration (increase in the supply of H-1B visa) on U.S born female. A one percent increase in the ratio of H-1B holders to natives lowers the wages of female native workers by 0.11 to 0.27 percent (sample 2, row 2, column 2 and 4). Interestingly, the baseline instrument has very small coefficient value and its O n u r A R S L A N | 35 significance level is weaker than male sample which is only significant at 10 percent level in both specifications (Sample 2, row 3, column 2 and 4). These findings are consistent with the elasticity of substitution estimation in table 3, which suggest that female non-immigrants and natives may not be perfect substitute. Even though, there is imperfect substitution between female natives and non-immigrants based on national approach, this result is not effective across to all occupations and work activities that are used in this study. For instance, in four out of eight occupations (social, physical, health and life sciences), increase in the supply of female non-immigrants has negative impact on the wages. However, in two out of eight occupations (engineering and computer sciences) the presences of female non-immigrants has virtually no impact on native wages and interestingly, in other science and engineering related occupations, the impact of female H-1B holders become slightly positive and statistically significant. Similarly, the difference between non-immigrants and natives in female sample varies across to work activities. The difference is larger than male sample in most activities such as management, applied research, accounting, finance, teaching, employee relations, design, productivity and quality management, development and professional services. These findings provide supporting evidence for the claim that non-immigrant and native female are farther substitutes than nonimmigrant and native male. In other words, the substitution effect between non-immigrant and native in man sample is stronger than the substitution effect in female sample.

It is clear that older workers annual wage rates are higher than younger workers in the work place. However, empirical results show that younger employees experience more rapid wage growth than older employees on average. Due to difference in the growth rate of the wages, magnitude of the wage effect of non-immigrants might be different between young and old workers. Therefore, I examine the effects of high skilled non-immigrants on wages separately for old and younger natives. While previous empirical research such as Huang and Hsueh (2009) has used 45 as cutoff age, this estimation might not be appropriate for non-immigrant H-1B workers, given that many H-1B holders are in their late 20s and early 30s when they finish their degree. Therefore, I split the sample into three different groups which are age under 30, age between 30 and 45 and age over 45. Chart 2 shows the age & earning profile for high skilled workers in science and engineering related occupations and indicates that wage growth mostly occurs between age 25 and 45. In addition, the graph shows that wage growth doesn't stop until late 40s. Due to difference in the growth rate of the wages between young and old workers, it is normal to expect small difference in the size of non-immigrant effect on the wages of young and older natives. It is possible that younger natives and non-immigrants are less alike than older natives and non-immigrants in terms of unobservable characteristics (Huang and Hsueh, 2009). According to Vidgor (2009), the degree of immigrant assimilation increases with the number of years spent in the host country. Since younger non-immigrants have lived in the U.S less than old non-immigrants on average, they are likely to be less assimilated into the American Society and therefore they compete with younger native individuals more intensively. In addition to the difference in assimilation level, the occupational mobility of younger non-immigrants might be higher than the mobility of older workers. In other words, young workers are more flexible in terms of moving out to other states for occupational purposes. The table 7 presents estimated effects of non-immigrant workers on the wages of natives by age groups. The sample one of table 7 displays the least square and instrumental O n u r A R S L A N | 38 variable estimates for individuals who are 30 years old and younger. Both of the estimations are negative and statistically significant at the 1 percent significance level (sample 1, row 2, columns from 1 to 4). These findings are similar to table 4 which ranges from -0.409 to -0.555. A ten percent increase in the ratio of H-1B holders to natives in an occupation decreases the wages of native workers by 4.0 to 5.55 percent in the same occupation. The baseline instrument shows positive correlation with the endogenous variable (RATIO ct ). It means that increase in the ratio of H-1 holders to natives in terms of bachelor's degree holders has a positive impact on the supply of non-immigrant workers (sample 1, row 3, columns 2 and 4). Similar to the sample 1, the second sample that presents the effects of H-1B policy on natives who are between 30 and 45 years old also indicates a negative correlation between the presence of H-1B holders and wages of natives (sample 2, row 2, columns from 1 to 4). On the other hand, the magnitude of non-immigration impact on wages is lower in the sample three which presents the LS and IV estimations for individuals who are 45 years old and older. The sample three of table 7 indicates that increase in the ratio of non-immigrants to natives has very small negative impact on the wages of U.S born native workers. The regression analysis shows that the magnitude of the effects ranges from lowest -0.116 to highest -0.213 and all of the coefficients are statistically significant (sample 3, row 2, columns from 1 to 4). These findings imply that a ten percent increase in the ratio of H-1B holders to natives lowers the wages of native workers by 1.16 to 2.13 percent. These results are consistent with the least square and instrumental variable estimates presented in appendix table 1, which suggest that younger non-immigrants may cause higher negative impact on the wages of natives due to intense competition with the young native corresponding workers. "}, {"section_title": "D) Region", "text": "In order to analyze the local effect of non-immigrant influx on the wages of natives, I examine the effect in different geographic regions. In the main equation 1 of non-immigrants on the wages of natives. This robustness check is very similar to area study approach which examines the effect locally. Because H-1B holders are more likely to live on the coasts especially east coast and west coast, the negative impact of H-1B visa program on the wages may be more severe in these regions. Opposite to expectations, the least square and instrumental estimates report no big difference between the regions. The region one in table 8 presents the estimations for individuals who live in the states where it's located in west coast of the United States. Similar to previous regression analysis, increase in the relative supply of non-immigrants has negative impact on the wages on native workers in west coast region. The magnitude of the negative impact is almost close to national level impact which is around 4 to 5 percent (region 1, row 2, columns from 1 to 4). In addition, the baseline instrument is positively correlated with the corresponding variable similar to other estimations. The positive impact ranges from 0.375 to 0.378, which implies that a ten percent increase in the presence of non-immigrant bachelor's degree holders raises the relative supply of workers who have H-1B visa by average of 3.6 percent (region 1, row 3, columns 2 and 4). The region two of table 8 displays the LS and IV estimations for sample group who lives in east coast of the United Stated. It is also observed that the direction and magnitude of the impact are quite similar to the region one sample. A possible explanation is that there is a growing labor demand for computer, engineering and O n u r A R S L A N | 41 IT related occupation on the coasts, which can decrease the negative impact of H-1B program on native wages by observing more non-immigrant workers from the labor market. The last sample of the table 8 reports outputs for individuals who live in center America including Midwest region. The main difference in this region is that the volume of the impact is slightly lower than other two regions; however the estimated coefficients are statistically significant only at the 10 percent significance level. These findings means that a ten percent increase in the ratio of H-1B holders to natives decreases the wages of native workers in Midwest region by 2.0 to 3.9 percent (region 3, row 2, columns from 1 to 4). Additionally, the baseline instrument is positively correlated with the RATIO ct variable and it is also significant at the 10 percent level.          "}]
