[{"section_title": "LIST OF TABLES", "text": ": Independent and Dependent Variables ........................................................................82 Retention and Attainment, 2006........................................................................................................123   Descriptive data indicated that, proportionally, engineering and engineering technologies completers were mostly White, married, middle income, employed part-time, enrolled full-time, did not hold a high school diploma or certificate, completed Trigonometry/Algebra II, had a father who's highest education level was an associate's degree, but did not know their mother's highest level of education, completed remedial coursework, and started college with the goal of earning an associate's degree. While more males enrolled in the programs, males and females demonstrated similar completion rates, proportionally-with females showing a slightly higher percentage of completion. Results from the logistic regression further indicated that the variables significant to completion in associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies were gender and enrollment size. Findings suggested that female students were more likely to earn the degree, and that the larger the institution, the more likely the student would become a completer. However, since a major limitation of the study was the small weighted sample size, the results of the study are inconclusive in terms of the extent to which the viii findings can be generalized to the population of students in associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies. This study fills a gap in the literature of what is known about engineering and engineering technician students. It also contributes to the body of research on an understudied STEM educational and professional pathway, the associate's degree in engineering and engineering technologies. 1"}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION", "text": "Nationwide, the demand for a skilled and educated workforce of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) technicians in the United States is greater than the supply. Not only are there demands to fill newly created positions in the STEM field, but there is also a need to fill existing and projected job vacancies that require an associate's degree at a minimum (Carnevale, Smith, & Melton, 2011). Of the new and replacement engineering and engineering technologies jobs, at least 25% will require an associate's degree (Carnevale et al., 2011;Carnevale, Smith, & Strohl, 2010). This represents the largest proportion of any of the five STEM occupational subgroups requiring an associate's degree. Broadly speaking, the National Research Council (NRC) (2012) defines engineering as, \"any engagement in a systematic practice of design to achieve solutions to particular human problems,\" (p. 11). In practice, engineers apply scientific principles in the design and development of said solutions or technologies. In turn, engineering technologies are, \"all types of human-made systems and processes\u2026and result when engineers apply their understanding of the natural world and of human behavior,\" (NRC, 2012, p. 11-12). Engineering technicians support other STEM professionals on exponentiating technologies from design and development to testing and installation. Specifically, engineering technicians focus on the practical application of the technologies to human problems by assisting engineers and other professionals with implementing and executing the designs; testing methods; manufacturing devices; and operating and maintaining equipment, systems, and other infrastructure (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, 2011;Lebold, 1985;National Society of Professional Engineers, 2013; The College Board, 2013). The need for engineering and engineering technicians with associate's degrees is greater in comparison to other fields because the academic programs prepare graduates with the fundamental knowledge and skills in at least eight types of engineering occupations (i.e., aerospace; civil; electrical and electronics; electro-mechanical; mechanical; environmental; industrial; survey and mapping). other subject areas doubled their number of associate's degree recipients (Aud, Rathburn, Flicker-Wilkinson, Krisapovich, Wang, & Zhang, 2013). Even more drastic was the overall drop in the number of female graduates from engineering and engineering technologies programs (25.3%) (Planty, Hussar, Snyder, Kena, KewalRamani, Kemp, Bianco, & Dinkes, 2009). There is clearly a need to understand more comprehensively the issue of low completion rates at community colleges. Forty-four percent of all U.S. undergraduates and 46% of first-time freshmen matriculate at community colleges-the largest percentage enrollment among all institutional types (Wild & Ebbers, 2002). However, Kopko and Cho (2013) found that almost 70% of first-time college students leave their community colleges without completing a program, and within 5 years of initial enrollment, only 15% receive a degree. Further, only 45% of first-time students meet their degree goal within six years of entering community college (Center for Community College Student Engagement, 2012). Despite a public declaration in Democracy's Colleges: Call to Action, the demand for more associate's degrees in advanced technological education (ATE) programs, and the creation of other national initiatives (i.e., the 21 st Century Initiative), community colleges are still plagued by problems of high attrition and low graduation rates (Coryn, Gullickson, & Ritchie, 2006;Hull, 2012;Westine, Gullickson, & Wingate, 2010). The cumulative consequences of dropping out and the economic and social benefits related to non-completion for the individual, institution, and economies are significant and cause for concern (Shuh & Gansemer-Topf, 2012;Tinto, 2012). Not only do non-completers leave college without a degree, but also many depart in debt (Gladieux & Perna, 2005;Wei & Horn, 2013). Nearly 25 percent of non-completers whose first institution was a community college took out federal student loans and they borrowed more money per credit than completers (Gladieux & Perna, 2005;Wei & Horn, 2013). Ultimately, those who borrowed funds and dropped out of community colleges experienced greater economic hardship and were more than likely to default on loans than borrowers that earned an associate's degree (Gladieux & Perna, 2005). The associate's degree holders can earn at least $15,000 more or $2,254,765 in lifetime earnings versus a student with some college, but no degree, and 15% to 30% more than high school graduates (Carnevale et al., 2010;Bailey, 2008). While graduates of community colleges experience the benefits from the returns on investments, a cohort of first-time, full-time freshmen (FTFT) that do not return and complete a program incur an opportunity cost of $3.8 billion in lifetime earnings (Schneider & Yin, 2011). When students depart college without graduating, there are immediate and long-term direct and indirect costs to the institution such as the loss of investment in students through recruitment and persistence programs and financial aid appropriations (Shuh & Gansemer-Topf, 2012). According to Johnson (2012), thirty-three percent of expenditures at community colleges are associated with students who leave without completing a degree compared to half as much of the cost at public universities and a quarter of the expenditures at private universities. Other negative financial implications of non-completion and attrition for institutions are the loss of income from tuition, fees, and other revenue-generating services and changes to instructional and administrative staffing and salaries (Shuh & Gansemer-Topf, 2012). Further, state and federal governments incur substantial losses in appropriations and potential tax income when students leave without completing a degree. Approximately $730 million in potential tax revenue for the federal government does not materialize (Schneider & Yin, 2011). Federal, state, and local appropriation losses associated with FTFT community college students who dropped out during the course of five academic years (2004-2005 through 2008-2009) totaled $4 billion (Schneider & Yin, 2011). These considerable personal and political costs necessitate further research of community college attrition and degree completion (Summers, 2003). While research on college attrition and persistence dates back nearly 80 years, studies were largely focused on students at 4-year institutions (Bailey, Alfonso, Calcagno, Jenkins, Kienzl, & Leinbach, 2004;Braxton, 2000;Nakajima, Dembo, & Mossler, 2012). Throughout, various definitions were used to define attrition and persistence. Tinto (2012) described the construct of attrition as the termination from college before degree completion. Persistence and completion, often used synonymously, can be defined as the start, continuation, and completion of a higher education degree (Tinto, 2012). That is to say, attrition refers to the action by noncompleters and persistence corresponds to that of completers. Among the research on community college persistence an even smaller fraction were multivariable studies whereas most explored a single variable (Nakajima et al., 2012;Sexton, 1965). However, an eventual consensus was found among researchers that single variables cannot predict attrition or persistence and is instead influenced by the interaction of more than one variable (Nakajima et al., 2012;Summers, 2003). Nevertheless, variables in previous studies can be considered either student or institutional factors (Sexton, 1965). Moreover, student and institutional factors were both found to be associated with departure and completion (Tinto, 2012;Tinto, 1993). The current study aims to address the gaps of the existing body of knowledge by exploring the two types variables (i.e., student and institutional) in student non-completion and completion at community colleges. Student variables are typically associated with attrition and persistence including students' demographic information such as age, gender, and ethnicity; family education background; finances; pre-college characteristics like high school GPA; college GPA; and, enrollment status (Habley, Bloom, & Robbins, 2012). Previous studies also point to institutional variables related to attrition and persistence and include static (e.g., geography), campus (e.g., size of total student population and sub-groups, number of part-time faculty members), and financial characteristics (e.g., cost of tuition, expenditures, financial aid distributions) (Bailey et al., 2004;Bailey, Calcagno, Jenkins, Kienzl, & Leinbach, 2008). However, the influences and interactions between multiple variables such as student-related and institutional variables are yet to be determined for completion at community colleges, and therein is another gap in the literature (Nakajima et al., 2012). Existing literature is laden with research on attrition more so than completion; and while informative, applying recommendations related to non-completing students is not entirely helpful and may be counterproductive in efforts to improve degree completion (Hagedorn, 2012;Mohammadi, 1996;Tinto, 1993;Tinto, 2012). A major limitation of findings from studies of attrition is that they are only valid with respect to types of non-completion (e.g., dropping out, stopping-out, transferring) and not the construct of degree completion (Tinto, 2012). Thus, the literature and comprehension of community college completion is incomplete and requires additional research (Berger, Blanco Ramirez, & Lyons, 2012;Tinto, 2012;Nakajima et al., 2012;Summers, 2003). Further, whereas characteristics of community college enrollees and non-completers are known, what are also unknown are the characteristics of community college completers and noncompleters of specific associate's degree programs. That is also to say that what is also absent is a study predicting factors of completion and non-completion in the context of specific occupational strands. Unfortunately, studies of engineering and/or engineering technologies associate's degree program completers and non-completers are sparse; and, even little is known on students who participate in these programs. Existing data on the state of STEM education and the engineering workforce are too broad, and researchers are missing important steps in methodology (Hagedorn & Purnamasari, 2012). Hagedorn and Purnamasari (2012) maintained that what is missing from previous scientific attempts is a disaggregation of student background information following the identification of specific STEM-occupational shortages. Therein lies a gap in higher education research on roles that student and institutional variables play in the context of engineering and engineering technologies at community colleges. Thus, research exploring the differences among completers and non-completers of associate's degree programs and the significant student-related and institutional contributors of completion of associate's degree programs in the context of engineering and engineering technologies programs is warranted."}, {"section_title": "Purpose of the Study", "text": "The purpose of this ex post facto study was to describe completers and non-completers of associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies at community colleges and determine whether completion in these programs is a function of selected student-related variables and institutional variables. For the purposes of this study, completion was defined as finishing the curricula in a program of study as signified by the outcome of an associate's degree awarded by the community college. Completers referred to students who were awarded an associate's degree, and non-completers were students who did not possess or were not awarded an associate's degree prior to departing. Serving as the context of the study, engineering was The second objective of the study was to determine whether and to what extent selected student-related variables related to demographic background, pre-college performance, and college performance and institutional variables such as institutional size, location, and percent minority enrollment, predict associate's degree completion in the fields of engineering and engineering technologies by analyzing a sample of students who completed the specific programs at community colleges. The identification of the variables stemmed from the existing literature and conceptual framework. As an example, the research on the predictive ability of gender as determinant of degree completion is mixed. On one hand, Gantt (2010), Craig and Ward (2008), Liu and Liu (1999), and Sewell and Shah (1967) contend that there is no difference between the graduation rates of men and women at community colleges, yet Jaeger and Eagan (2009) concluded the opposite. To achieve the purposes of this study, the researcher used 3-and 6-year completion rates and 17 variables available in the BPS: 04/09. the study is rooted in Vincent Tinto's seminal theory of student integration and organized according to Alexander Astin's \"Input-Environment-Outcome\" (I-E-O) Model. Tinto (1993) described the behaviors of completion and attrition as a longitudinal decision-making process influenced by student and institutional characteristics. Specifically, completion and departure are a result of the individual's demographic and pre-college attributes, finances, goals and commitments, institutional experiences, and integration (Tinto, 1993). While the components related to student departure (i.e., student and institutional) in Tinto's theory of student integration are also present in completion, their influences and interactions are yet to be determined for completion at community colleges (Tinto, 2012). Given what the literature says about student and institutional variables associated with student college outcomes, the study also draws from the theoretical model of Alexander Astin's Theory of Student Involvement. Astin's theory was the result of a longitudinal study that sought to identify the factors that affected student persistence in college. Astin (1991) and his colleges suggested an approach to examining student outcomes in which student outcomes are a direct function of inputs and inputs plus the environment. Known as the \"Input-Environment-Outcome\" (I-E-O) Model, the \"I\" in the I-E-O Model stands for Inputs that are the student's personal qualities that he or she enters the educational context with and would be used in research studies as an independent variable for those employing the Model (Astin, 1991). This includes the same student variables described by Tinto (1993) (i.e., demographic background, academic performance [past and present], and pre-college experiences). \"E\" is the Environment, and would also be used as an independent variable (Astin, 1991). As is the case with Tinto's theory and institutional variables, examples of \"E\" include student and faculty population demographics, academic and social programs, and institutional and programmatic characteristics or variables. Lastly, \"O\" or Outcomes, are the intended \"talents\" that the institution or program wants to develop or influence (i.e., college completion), and would be considered the dependent or criterion variable(s) (Astin, 1991). Omitting one of the three constructs in research renders the model incomplete, generates results that are ambiguous, biased, or difficult to interpret, and subsequent policy and programmatic decisions are misinformed and ineffective (Astin, 1991). The conceptual framework constructed for the purposes of this study is therefore an integration of two major theoretical strands: Tinto's Student Integration Model and Astin's \"Input-Environment-Outcome\" (I-E-O) Model. The result is a modification of Astin's I-E-O Model into a conceptual framework examining the key student-related and institutional factors of the output of program completion. The researcher explored in the construct the individual variables commonly referenced in the literature related to completion, measurable among the student population and institutions, and within the scope of the BPS: 04/09 dataset. Finally, the framework was used to interpret the results of the executed research methods."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Inherent limitations to this study existed in the sampling and data collection procedures from the BPS: 04/09. The BPS: 04/09 and National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) used self-reported information from interviews and institutionally reported data. NPSAS and BPS cohorts consisted of first-time beginning students (FTB) or students attending postsecondary education for the first time at any sample institution during the [2004][2005] academic year. Data for students were only as reliable as what was self-reported, and to maximize the number of participants, students were given three options or environments for interviews (via web, telephone, or in-person). The options to submit institutional responses were via secured fax or FedEx. Therefore, multiple methods of data collection were used. Second, because the design of the BPS: 04/09 study involved follow-up interviews with students and sourcing institutional data from other surveys, there were likely non-respondents and students and institutions ruled ineligible between the first study and the follow-up and between the second and third follow-up. For example, NCES asserted that there was a higher rate of non-response when using computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI), which NCES used in BPS (Wine, Cominole, Wheeless, Bryant, Gilligan, Dudley, & Franklin, 2006). Quality of data, response rates, and representativeness may decrease while costs and burden rates associated with CATI increase (Wine et al., 2006). Related, one limitation of IPEDS, the originating survey for institutional data in BPS: 04/09, is that it encompasses distinct reporting methodologies that do not include items pertaining to ancillary services and programs and other institutional statistics specific to individual community colleges (e.g., faculty office hours, faculty-student ratios). Therefore, if they were not reported on the IPEDS survey, the potential variables were excluded from the BPS: 04/09 dataset and omitted as part of the present study's methodology. The impact of the omitted variables could not be measured."}, {"section_title": "Delimitations", "text": "This study is delimited to graduates of public, 2-year colleges with associate's degrees. At 2-year colleges, students enter and depart willingly. Identifying the factors related to student attrition (e.g., stopping out, dropping out, or transferring institutions) is not the purpose of the study. Second, not all students attend college to earn a 2-year degree. Some are interested in specific credit or non-credit coursework; others intend only to complete general education requirements to transfer to a 4-year university. There are also a proportion of students that complete industry certificates. This study is not concerned with the aforementioned but rather focuses on the population of students that received associate's degree conferrals because these are records kept by institutions and can be reported to the NCES. If students earned enough credits to graduate and officially complete the degree program but did not receive the conferral, they were omitted from the sample of completers. Third, the focus of this study is restricted to student retention from the specific classification of program (CIP) codes 14 and 15 engineering and engineering technologies programs. The study is generalizeable for the student population in said programs but not generalizeable for students in other CIP codes. A related delimitation is that the sample excludes students who completed a professional credential, even in CIP codes 14 and 15. Lastly, the study is delimited to information and variables within the scope of the survey administered in the BPS: 04/09. Related, the data was extracted from the BPS: 04/09 public-use dataset. The NCES pre-coded and deleted individually identifiable information from the survey for public use. The NCES also created a federally protected, restricted-use file that includes confidential and individually identifiable information from student interviews and institutions. Access to the restricted-use file and its contents can be obtained on a case-by-case basis following the submission of an application for a license and subject to additional security procedures. Obtaining a license to NCES restricted-use data typically requires demonstrated experience with the public-use dataset and a justifiable need to greater access because of the proven insufficiency of publically available data."}, {"section_title": "Significance of the Study", "text": "Community colleges are a valuable source of well-prepared graduates feeding into the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce and educational pipeline of university and college baccalaureate programs. However, long-standing issues for American community colleges are low degree completion and high attrition rates relative to the sheer number of students that enroll. This study advances education research by examining the variables related to the completion of STEM degrees, specifically at the sub-baccalaureate level, and fills the gap in the literature on engineering and engineering technician students. An examination of student-related and institutional variables from BPS: 04/09 will be used to explore the phenomena of low completion in engineering and engineering technologies programs at community colleges. The advantages of using BPS: 04/09 are such that data can be delineated between programmatic codes, and it surveyed traditional and non-traditional students on a number of student and institutional variables that were neither used in the past to study STEM students and nor are available in other datasets. Using selected variables from the BPS: 04/09, the multiple regression analyses will reveal whether any variables are significantly related to completion. Colleges will then be able to better concentrate efforts and resources on the significant student and institutional variables to increase completion (Hagedorn & Purnamasari, 2012). Community college and program administrators will then be able to obtain a firmer grasp on the students to which institutional action should be directed (Hagedorn & Purnamasari, 2012;Tinto, 2012). Student profiles will emerged that may inform recruitment initiatives, support services, and curricular design, for example.

Experienced engineers, for example, felt they were ill equipped, inexperienced, and too few in numbers to continue to meet the rising demand for quality on-the-job training (Nienkamp, 2010;Reynolds, 1992). Aspiring engineers learned their craft for a number of years as apprentices at worksites and offices shadowing private practicing engineers (Reynolds, 1992). The manual labor training allowed engineers to invent machines, create processes, and manage construction (Nienkamp, 2010). Early engineering manuals and books used in the United States were written in French or translated from French, and, it was largely French-educated engineers who directed engineering projects (Grayson, 1985). To meet the growing demands of the workforce in the U.S., charitable societies of mechanics, agriculturalists, and other groups began establishing schools for factory workers and children (Barlow, 1976;Gordon, 2008). The model of postsecondary engineering education in the United States was influenced by higher education military institutions-specifically, the United States Military Academy at West Point, Norwich University, the Virginia Military Institute, and the Citadel (Grayson, 1980;Reynolds, 1992). Even then, however, the U.S. Army corps of engineers learned their craft through apprenticeship-like training combined with military instruction, a curriculum influenced by the French military (Grayson, 1980;Reynolds, 1992). It was not until 1817, after Colonel Sylvanus Thayer had returned to West Point from France, that postsecondary engineering education began to take shape (Grayson, 1980;Reynolds, 1992). Thayer outlined a program requiring cadets to attend four yearly classes and write weekly reports, and he detailed the subjects required for graduation (Grayson, 1980). Like military engineering education, schools for the public were modeled after lyceums and polytechnics in Germany and France (Grayson, 1980). The Gardiner Lyceum, founded in 1823, focused its programs on practical applications and offered a 3-year engineering course of study (Grayson, 1980;Reynolds, 1992). The Rensselaer Institute created a one-year, civil engineering degree program that later developed into a 3-year engineering degree program. Similarly, the Polytechnic College of Pennsylvania offered 2-year engineering programs that lead to bachelor's degrees. Engineering curricula largely typified what is now civil engineering as the United States continued to acquire land that required skills in design, fieldwork experience, and the construction of new infrastructure (Grayson, 1980). The expansion of engineering education was suspended or permanently discontinued during an economic depression that lasted from 1837 to 1843 (Reynolds, 1992). Once the depression lifted, thousands of people could not gain entry into or were not interested in traditional colleges that taught law, medicine, Latin, and ministry. Prospective engineers and others later instrumental in designing and building the American transit network favored more industrial curricula and scientific inquiry (Grayson, 1980;Reynolds, 1992). The overwhelming critiques of traditional colleges and unique dual demands for professional training and education paved the way for the grass-roots mission of land-grant institutions (Grubb & Lazerson, 2007;Reynolds, 1992). Created by Congress under the Morrill Act of 1862, the purpose of land-grant institutions (one college required in each state in the Union) included the following: Teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and mechanic arts, in such manner as the legislatures of the State may respectively prescribe, in order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life. (\"Morrill Act of 1862,\" 1862) Approximately 227 colleges participated in the Engineering, Science, Management, and War Training Program between 1940and 1945(Grayson, 1979. The Program consisted of short courses to increase engineering technicians, engineering assistants, drafters, testers, and other similar positions (Grayson, 1979). The training program was introduced in response to a shortage of trained technicians during wartime as a program available for veterans under the G.I. Bill of Rights and was not seen as competition for the existing engineering degree programs (Grayson, 1979). The trend of higher enrollments after the war signified a rise in both the educational and economic levels among middle-class and skilled working engineers who saw the benefits of some college (Grayson, 1979)."}, {"section_title": "Current Workforce Demands and Trends", "text": "Nationwide, the demand for a skilled workforce is greater than the supply. In economic terms, there is a labor shortage. A labor shortage is defined as, \"a market disequilibrium between supply and demand in which the quantity of workers demanded exceeds the supply available and willing to work at a particular wage and working conditions at a particular place and point in time,\" (Pindus, Tilly, & Weinstein, 2002, p.2). Between 2008 and 2018, an associate's degree or some training or education will be required in half of the 20 fastest growing occupations (Carnevale, Smith, & Strohl, 2010). Among 9 occupational clusters, \"Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)\" holds the spot for the third-fastest growing category behind \"Healthcare Professional and Technical\" and \"Healthcare Support;\" and, is ranked second in terms of growth rate of job openings requiring at least some college (Carnevale et al., 2010). Approximately 313,000 new and replacement STEM occupations will require an associate's degree (Carnevale et al., 2010). Of the new and replacement engineering and engineering technology jobs, nearly 25% will require an associate's degree (Carnevale, Smith, & Melton, 2011). Even with the existing supply of engineering graduates, it is still not guaranteed that these students will enter or continue with an engineering or STEM occupation. According to Carnevale et al. (2011), forty-three percent of STEM Bachelor's degree holders do not work in a STEM occupation immediately after graduation and 46% of the resulting workforce are expected to leave the field 10 years later. In other words, for every 100 students that enter college and graduate with a Bachelor's degree, 19 of those students are STEM majors, 10 of who will work in a STEM occupation immediately after college, and 8 of who will be working in a STEM occupation 10 years later (Carnevale et al., 2011). Where are these graduates going? STEM graduates tend to move into occupations with higher pay and areas where their skills are transferrable and core values and interests compatible. In the long run, STEM graduates can earn higher income in non-STEM fields. For example, although Bachelor degree holders in STEM may earn higher wages immediately after college in a STEM occupation, by mid-career, STEM occupational earnings are surpassed by Managerial and Professional occupational earnings by at least $10,000 (Carnevale et al., 2011). Even more convincing, healthcare professional workers with a graduate degree can earn $50,000 more than a STEM graduate by the age of 35 (Carnevale et al., 2011). STEM and non-STEM employers are competing for the same type of worker and it appears that the trend among the workforce is to go where the money is or the non-STEM employer that provides greater financial security in the long run. All industries and labor markets are realizing the value and transferability of STEM competencies, both cognitive (i.e., knowledge, skills, and abilities) and non-cognitive (i.e., work values and interests) (Carnevale et al., 2011). Collected by Carnevale et al. (2011), among the O*NET STEM Knowledge competencies associated with STEM are production and processing; computers and electronics; design; building and construction; physics; chemistry; and, biology. STEM Skills in demand include mathematics; science; critical thinking; active listening; programming; troubleshooting; systems analysis and evaluation; and, operations monitoring (Carnevale et al., 2011). Last, but not least among the cognitive competencies, STEM Abilities are those related to problem solving; deductive, inductive, and mathematical reasoning; perceptual speed; control precision; and, number facility (Carnevale et al., 2011 innovative; artistic; enterprising) (Carnevale et al., 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Trends in the Engineering Industry and Profession", "text": "Current workforce demands and trends in STEM are driven by the emergence of new and exponential changes to existing technologies-all of which are subject to a form of Moore's Law. In a 1965 publication, Gordon Moore, founder of Intel Corporation, plotted the complexity or the number of components put into chips from 1956 to 1965, observed a doubling each year, and predicted an increase by a thousand-fold another ten years later (Brock, 2006). Moore (2005) updated his prediction in 1975 to state that every two years the number of transistors per chip would double. While Moore's Law was originally stated in reference to the trend in the speed of microprocessor chips, the direction of the semiconductor industry as a whole, and economics associated with integrated electronics, Moore's Law is now ubiquitous with technological change and innovation of any size and scope (Brock, 2006). The most notable areas of technology experiencing exponential growth as identified by Duder (2008) are in the areas of information technology, biotechnology, and nanotechnology. Further, along with exponentiating technologies, he expects the contexts of an \"info-bio-nano\" convergence, disruptive technologies, and technologies to social change to challenge engineering. Currently, the doubling-time is 9 to 12 months for digital technology components like memory and bandwidth (Duder, 2008). Duder (2008) predicts computing power to progress from \"giga\" (i.e., 10 9 ), to \"tera,\" (i.e., 10 12 ), \"peta\" (i.e., 10 15 ), and \"exa,\" (i.e., 10 18 ) possibly in two decades time. Another type of technology also doubling in power every ten years or increasing in capacity between a hundredfold and thousand-fold are the components of \"cyberinfrastructure,\" or technologies for information and communications and that which connects computer hardware, software, people, businesses, institutions, etc. (Duder, 2008). Duder (2008) concluded that the engineering profession would continue to be influenced by national interests in technological innovation, biological processes, and economic competitiveness in cultural and geopolitical contexts. For example, off-shoring and near-shoring electronics manufacturing and call-centers to Asia and South America as a means of lowering costs is an ongoing phenomenon for years now (Donahoe & Pecht, 2003;Duder, 2008). Hightech companies are following the trend by globally sourcing other engineering functions including software engineering, design, research and development, consulting, and services out of the U.S. to places where engineering skills are improving such as India and China (Donahoe & Pecht, 2003;Duder, 2008). At the same time, foreign direct investments by companies looking to expand operations and plants in the U.S. (e.g., Samsung, GE) promote in-sourcing and job creation in the U.S. (Oberst & Jones, 2006;Power, 2013). American electric automobile manufacturer, Telsa, and Japanese electronics company, Panasonic, are partnering to construct a \"gigafactory\" in Reno, Nevada. It is touted to be the largest and most advanced factory in the world upon completion in 2017. By 2020, Tesla will employ 6,500 workers directly and possibly create up to 15,000 more jobs indirectly due to the \"multiplier effect,\" (Beasley & Woodyard, 2014). The Nevada Manufacturers Association executive director, Ray Bacon, believes the three categories of the workforce that will be needed are, 1) workers with a high school diploma or equivalent, manufacturing skills, and gain on-the-job training from Tesla; 2) top-level, professional engineers, scientists, engineers, quality testers; and, 3) manufacturing professions and mid-level management (Beasley & Woodyard, 2014). Bacon further specifies the educational and training requirements and sources. The first group of workers can be sourced from Career and Technical Education (CTE) high school centers and receive additional training at Nevada community colleges sponsored by Tesla (Beasley & Woodyard, 2014). The second set of professionals would include those with a Bachelors degree plus industry experience. Requirements for the third group would be employees with associate's degrees and/or certificates (Beasley & Woodyard, 2014)."}, {"section_title": "Trends in Employment for Engineering Technologists", "text": "Graduates with an associate's degree in engineering and engineering technologies are eligible to apply and obtain employment in one of at least 8 broad technician occupations and 14 disciplines described by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. Faster than the average for all other occupations, the need for environmental engineering technicians is expected to grow by 30% through 2018 (Carnevale et al., 2010). This represents the largest proportion of any of the other four STEM subgroups (i.e., Computer; Mathematical Science; Architects, Surveyors, and Technicians; and, Life and Physical Science) (Carnevale et al., 2011). As another example, each year, employers are specifically searching for at a minimum, associate's degree holders in engineering and engineering technologies to fulfill the need for 30,000 welders in addition to replacements for the 40-60% of energy utilities workers who are now eligible for retirement (as cited in Advanced Technological Education Centers, 2013). According to the U.S. Department of Labor 2014 Businesses may be additionally attracted to hiring technicians that were trained by community colleges for their positive impact to the operations. Engineering and engineering technologies graduates employed in biotechnology and chemical engineering technician positions that were trained by community colleges through Process Technology education (PTEC), \u2022 Improved plant asset utilization by as much as 4% \u2022 Reduced hiring costs by 80 to 90% \u2022 Lowered two-year turnover by recent hires by 50% \u2022 Reduced the cost of on-the-job-training by 40%; and, \u2022 Experienced 37% fewer industrial accidents, (NAPTA, 2015). One of the fastest growing occupations between 2012 and 2022 is for environmental engineering technicians. Compared to the average projected growth for all other occupations, employment in environmental engineering technicians is projected to grow faster (18 percent) (U.S. Department of Labor, 2014). The high demand for environmental engineering technicians will continue to be driven by state and local infrastructure projects related to effective and efficient wastewater treatment, water use, and contamination and clean-up. Compliance with Congressional mandates, state and federal environmental regulations, as well as additional directives by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), for example, is where the technician's help will be most utilized (U.S. Department of Labor, 2014). Another job with excellent prospects for employment is for wind turbine service technicians or \"windtechs.\" According to the BLS (2015) the U.S. was already facing a shortage of windtechs by the end of 2015. Faster than the projected growth for all other occupations, employment for these technicians are expected to grow by 108 percent through 2024 (U.S."}, {"section_title": "Department of Labor, 2015", "text": "). More job opportunities are likely where there are consistent and prevalent winds (i.e., coastal and Midwestern states) and if individual states provide incentives to wind farms (U.S. Department of Labor, 2014). In addition, the job growth projection can also further increase depending on offshore project prospecting (U.S. Department of Labor, 2015). Tasks include installing and maintaining wind turbines. Considering the working conditions (i.e., great heights, confined spaces), barriers to entry into this workforce are non-existent and there is little competition for jobs. Additional technicians will be needed on a consistent basis as interest in renewable or sustainable energy sources such as wind electricity engineering increases. Another employment area also projected to grow faster than the average for all occupations through 2022 is for geological and petroleum technicians (15 percent) (U.S."}, {"section_title": "Department of Labor, 2014", "text": "). The higher than average employment growth is attributed to the increasing demand for natural gas, high oil prices, and those around the world holding middleclass wealth (U.S. Department of Labor, 2014). Geological and petroleum technicians assist in the exploration, extraction, production processes, and monitoring of natural resources such as natural gas and as well as other minerals (e.g., coal, metals) and oil. Similarly, the employment of nuclear technicians is also expected to grow by the same amount (15 percent) as geological and petroleum technicians (U.S. Department of Labor, 2014). The projected employment growth of nuclear technicians is also driven by the increasing interest, research, and demand for nuclear and other alternative energy sources to those that emits greenhouse gasses. The job of nuclear technicians includes, but is not limited to, helping scientists and engineers in nuclear research, development, and production projects. These projects may be found in areas related to national defense, waste management, and medical technology. They may operate special equipment to monitor radiation levels and assist in the design of reactors and fuels that are more efficient and safer for the environment. In general, the employment growth outlook for nuclear technicians through 2022 is promising as those who retire or depart the industry for other reasons increases the amount of job openings for others to enter (U.S. Department of Labor, 2014). Close in projected job growth is employment of survey and mapping technicians at 14 percent (U.S. Department of Labor, 2014). Demand for these technicians is expected to continue with the digital revolution. Existing and historical maps are digitized and data inputted into geographic information systems (GIS) by the technicians. This information is especially useful for private and prospective landowners as well as urban and regional city, county, and state planners for infrastructure purposes. Heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration (HVACR) technicians is another type of job projected to grow at a faster than average rate (21 percent) than all occupations (U.S. Department of Labor, 2014). The increased demand can be attributed to the recovery from the recent recession by the construction industry. Qualified HVACR technicians will continue to be needed to install, climate-controlled systems in new commercial and residential buildings. In addition, the technicians will be in demand to upgrade, replace, and retrofit existing systems, and these types of overhauls are typically undertaken every 10 to 15 years. The employment growth is additionally driven by increased efforts at reducing pollution, regulations barring the emission of environmentally hazardous refrigerants, and interest in becoming energy efficient (U.S. Department of Labor, 2014).  (Bailey & Morest, 2003)."}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of Community Colleges", "text": "In Volume I, \"Establishing the Goals,\" the commission emphasized ways in which general and vocational education taught by community colleges are essential, complementary, and interdependent in developing the breadth and depth of a student's economic intelligence and person (President's Commission on Higher Education, 1947). The commission charged community colleges with the responsibility of satisfying the needs of the economy with qualified workers that possessed social understanding and technical competence. According to the report, to accomplish these objectives, 2-and 4-year terminal programs, workshops, refresher courses, and centers of adult education should be provided by community colleges and be made accessible to the entire postsecondary population. The commission recognized the specific need and forecast the demand for electrical technicians and aviators among other fields that training programs specifically at community colleges would be able to supply. The core missions outlined by the commission are some of the facets that distinguish the community colleges from other types of 2-year, associate's degree-granting institutions (i.e., private not-for-profit, for-profit). In 2011-2012, there were 970 public 2-year institutions or community colleges, 90 private not-for-profit or \"independent\" colleges, and 670 private forprofit colleges offering associate's degrees (Aud et al., 2013). A majority of the public colleges are located in rural areas (CCCSE, 2014). As expected, the methods of executing the missions (e.g., tuition and fees structure, institutional offerings, resources) at community colleges are also different from private, for-profit, and other community colleges. Community colleges are well- known for their open-access to higher education, whereas for-profits target students, accept students at lower rates, and offer less programs (Aud et al., 2013;Bender, 1991;Goan & Cunningham, 2007). In 2011-2012, fifty-percent of private non-profits and 79% of private colleges had open admissions policies (Aud et al., 2013). Net tuition (i.e., published tuition minus financial aid) is highest at private not-for-profit, followed by for-profits, and community colleges (Goan & Cunningham, 2007). Since community colleges make less revenue from tuition and fees, there is less access to capital (Bailey, Badaway, & Gumport, 2001). At least 87% of the revenue at 2year for-profit and 70% at private non-profit colleges comes from tuition and fees compared to only 16% at public colleges (Goan & Cunningham, 2007). In contrast, public colleges receive 72% of revenue from government grants, contracts, and appropriations. Thus, it appears that forprofits, for example, have greater flexibility financially to support new and changing infrastructure (including technology), supplies and equipment, and curricula (Bailey et al., 2001). Though, it still is more common to find remedial services, day-care, and work-study at community colleges as opposed to the private and for-profit colleges (Goan & Cunningham, 2007). While there may be more non-academic, ancillary services (e.g., counseling, admissions, placement, career planning, financial aid, student and registrar services) at community colleges, they are less integrated and streamlined (Bailey et al., 2001;Grubb, 2001). For example, counselor-student ratios are much lower at community colleges (Bailey et al., 2001). While all colleges employ the same percentage of instructional faculty as part-time staff members (73% to 78%), the percentage of full-time instructional faculty at for-profits are typically higher (Goan & Cunningham, 2007)."}, {"section_title": "Goals of the Engineering and Engineering Technologies Education", "text": "Successful completion of associate's degree programs prepares graduates for entry into the trade and positions in an industry requiring technical skill and competencies as well as the ability to transfer units earned to a 4-year institution. Engineering and engineering technologies educational programs fall under the CIP codes 14 and 15, respectively. The engineering CIP code 14 includes \"instructional programs that prepare individuals to apply mathematical and scientific principles to the solution of practical problems\" (NCES, n.d., n.p.). The NPSE 2013described engineering programs as those \"geared toward development of conceptual skills, and consist of a sequence of engineering fundamentals and design courses, built on a foundation of complex mathematics and science courses\" (n.p.). Two-year engineering programs typically require two years of calculus and advanced math, one year of chemistry, and one year of physics or a similar calculus-based theoretical science (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology [ABET], 2011; Lipset, 2012). Whereas engineering program curricula are theoretical in nature and prepare students to be designers, engineering technologies programs focus on the practical applications and the implementation of designs, testing methods, and measuring devices of others (ABET, 2011;Lebold, 1985;NSPE, 2013). Programs under engineering technologies CIP code 15 are \"instructional programs that prepare individuals to apply basic engineering principles and technical skills in support of engineering and related projects or to prepare for engineering-related fields\" (NCES, n.d.). Similarly, the NSPE (2013) defined engineering technologies programs as those \"oriented toward application, and provide their students introductory mathematics and science courses, and only a qualitative introduction to engineering fundamentals\" (n.p.). Two-year engineering technologies programs typically require students to engage in math sequencing that includes a progression from algebra to trigonometry to applied calculus (ABET, 2011). At least one semester of calculus and business or managerial coursework is required, but courses beyond calculus are not required (Lipset, 2012). Over half of the technical courses include work in the laboratories, unlike engineering programs, which require only half as much laboratory courses (Lipset, 2012). Absent of government control over higher engineering education curricula, programs engage in voluntary, peer-review accreditation through either regional agencies that assess entire institutions or private, professional organizations that accredit individual programs of study (Schachterle, 1999 (Aud et al., 2013;Goan & Cunningham, 2007;CCCSE, 2012). Of students who attended public colleges part-time, fifty-two percent were under the age of 25 compared to 40% at private non-profits and 39% at for-profits (Aud et al., 2013). The percentages among part-time students ages 35 and above was at or near one-quarter at each of types of campuses (Aud et al., 2013). Of students who attended public colleges full-time, seventy-one percent were under the age of 25 compared to 59% at private non-profits and 47% at for-profits (Aud et al., 2013). Full-time students typically entered college after graduating from high school (Kotamraju & Blackman, 2011). In the 2010 \"Survey of Entering Student Engagement Survey,\" (SENSE) of entering community college students, almost 80% noted an intention to earn an associate's degree, and 70% aspired to transfer to a four-year college or university (CCCSE, 2014). However, a majority of students these students require some type of remedial or developmental coursework (CCRSE, 2012). Sixty-six percent or 75,587 student respondents needed to take developmental coursework in at least one area after taking a placement test for entry (CCRSE, 2012). In a subsequent survey by the CCCSE, seventy-two percent or 93,989 survey respondents needed to take developmental coursework in at least one area after taking a placement test for entry (CCRSE, 2012). Some type of financial aid is disbursed to nearly half of community college students with more than 2 million students receiving Pell grants in 2005 (AACC, 2014). Low-income students are more likelier than students from middle-or high-income families to attend public 2-year institutions because they are cheaper than private not-for-profits and for-profits (Goan & Cunningham, 2007). Except, the percentage of independent students with incomes less than $15,000 is proportionally lower at public colleges (Goan & Cunningham, 2007). Private not-forprofits publish tuition rates higher than community colleges; but, their students and for-profits receive more financial aid (i.e., Stafford loans, Pell grants, federal aid, private loans), receive higher incomes than those attending community colleges; and, still pay at least $4000 more in net tuition (Bailey et al., 2001;Goan & Cunningham, 2007). In addition to differences in financial sources among students who attend the 3 classifications of colleges, there are also differences proportionally according to ethnicity, age, gender, and enrollment. The percentages of Caucasians and Asians are higher at public 2-year colleges than those at private non-profits and for-profits. In contrast, the percentages of Native American/Alaskan Natives attending private non-profit and Blacks attending private colleges are higher than their institutional counterparts (Aud et al., 2013;Goan & Cunningham, 2007). Whereas more women enroll at public colleges more men attend private for-profits (Goan & Cunningham, 2007)."}, {"section_title": "Trends in Completion", "text": "Community colleges still possess a lower share of conferred associate's degrees by fulltime and part-time students compared to other classifications of 2-year, associate's degreegranting institutions (Goan & Cunningham, 2007). According to the Chronicle of Higher Education (2014), of the first-time, full-time students that entered college in 2004 and graduated between 2008 and 2010, one hundred and nineteen thousand degrees were conferred by community colleges, followed by 121,000 by for-profits, and 292,000 from private colleges. Community colleges for these graduates were concentrated mainly in the West, Midwest, and Northeastern parts of the U.S. However, the institution with the highest graduation rate (1,020) was Valencia Community College in Florida. Of note, these numbers are not an accurate count of completers since part-time students, drop-outs, and transfers (but earned a degree from another college) were omitted from the dataset used (IPEDS). On the other hand, the NSC (2012b) used unduplicated, student-level data that included part-time and full-time completers. There was a decrease in the amount of degrees awarded at 2-year public institutions in 2011-2012 across all age groups (i.e., under 25, 25-39, 40 and above) (NSC, 2012). Compared to 4-year institutions, the percentage of timely completions at community colleges was significantly higher between 1980 and 2009 (Aud, KewalRamani, & Frohlich, 2011). The time-to-completion rates of associate's degree programs at community colleges (public 2-year) were also longer than private and for-profit 2-year institutions (Horn, 2010). There was little variation among time-to-completion rates among community colleges. For example, in a study of the spring 1987 associate's degree graduates of the City College of Chicago, 4% graduated in two years or 100% of regular time and 20% graduated in 10 years or 500% of regular time (Garcia, 1994). Similarly, Grosset (1993) found that among 765 spring of 1990 associate's degree graduates at a large urban community college, 5.9% graduated within two years, the largest percentage of graduates (30.3%) took longer than six years to graduate. In a study of three San Diego Community College districts' associate of arts programs, among students graduating in June 1992, the average number of years to earn the degree was 5 (Peterman, 2010). Whereas African Americans averaged 4.6 years to graduate, it took Latinos an average of 8.6 years. However, length of time-to-completion differences by gender and age were insignificant (Peterman, 2010). Comparably, one of the shortest average graduation rates was noted in the Peralta Community College District's institutional report for their spring 1990 graduates, with 4.5 years or 9.13 terms (Spinetta & Phillips, 1991 1996, 1997, and 1998, there was an almost 50% income increase (Gillum & Davies, 2003). As separate cohorts, two years after completion the 1996 cohort experienced an increased earnings power of 56.7%, 1997 cohort's earnings power was 43.9%, and 1998 cohort earnings power was 45% (Gillum & Davies, 2003). Associate's degree holders can earn at least $15,000 more or $2,254,765 in lifetime earnings versus a student with some college, but no degree, and 15% to 30% more than high school graduates (Carnevale et al., 2010;Bailey, 2008). Graduates with associate's degrees in a CTE concentration can earn as much as $21,000 more than graduates who studied humanities and social sciences (Carnevale et al., 2011;Jacobson & Mokher, 2009). At any level of educational attainment, STEM workers can earn \"family-sustaining earnings,\" (Carnevale, 2011). Specifically, engineering and engineering technicians with an associate's degree can earn on average $63,000 per year or almost $21,000 more than those in non-STEM occupations (Carnevale, 2011 "}, {"section_title": "Trends in Non-Completion", "text": "Students who began at 2-year institutions were twice as likely to dropout as their counterparts attending 4-year institutions (Mohammadi, 1996;NCES, 2004;Tinto, 1993). Noncompletion at 2-year, public institutions is most common among underserved, low-income, and ethnic minority students and their departure often occurs soon after enrolling (Bailey et al., 2004;Elkins, Braxton, & James, 2000). Approximately three-fourths of all students who drop out leave at some time during their first year and as early as a month and half into the semester (Elkins, Braxton, & James, 2000 (Elkins, Braxton, & James, 2000). In a study by the Community College Research Center of 14,617 first-time college students, sixty-eight percent left the college without completing a program and within five years of initial enrollment during the 2005-2006 academic year only 16% received an award (Kopko & Cho, 2013). In a similar 5-year study by Jaeger and Eagan (2009), only 19% of the 178,985 community college students earned an associate's degree. Departure rates for vocational concentrators at community colleges are even higher than the general student population and those attending 4-year universities (Ko, 2005). Within three years of first enrolling, seventy-one percent of vocational education students dropped out of their community college (Ko, 2005). In examining occupational strands, students enrolled in vocational programs other than science, math, humanities, and liberal arts are less likely to earn an associate's degree (Jaeger & Eagan, 2009). For students who entered the engineering and engineering technologies programs in 1995-1996, only 15% earned an associate's degree, 19% were still enrolled, and 28% were not enrolled (Chen & Wako, 2009). Compared with graduates from other CTE programs, the number of graduates from engineering and engineering technologies is experiencing the most dramatic of declines. In both the 2000-2001 and 2010-2011 academic years, engineering and engineering technologies failed to make it among the top three programs awarding the most associate's degrees (Aud et al., 2013). While other programs experienced more than 100% increases, the number of associate's degrees awarded decreased in engineering and engineering technologies by 16% or fewer than 6,800 (Aud et al., 2013). Comparing the academic year 2007-2008, the total number of associate degrees awarded was 51,226 or 7.9% less than the number of degrees conferred in 1997-1998 (Aud et al., 2010). The number of total associate degrees awarded continued to fall the following academic year when in 2008-2009 only 50,662 associate's degrees in engineering and engineering technologies were conferred. This represents an 11.6% decrease in the total number of degrees conferred compared to 1998-1999 (Planty, Hussar, Snyder, Kena, KewalRamani, Kemp, Bianco, & Dinkes, 2009). Even more drastic was the drop in the number of women with degrees awarded from this specific degree program (25.3%), (Planty et al., 2009). During the academic year 2005-2006, women were awarded only 15% of all Associate degrees under the engineering CIP code and no more than 17% in engineering technologies at rural, suburban, and urban colleges (Hardy & Katsinas, 2010). Where graduates of community colleges experience the benefits from the returns on investments, a cohort of first-time, full-time freshmen (FTFT) that do not return and complete a program incur an opportunity cost of $3.8 billion in lifetime earnings (Schneider & Yin, 2011). Further, state and federal governments incur substantial losses in appropriations and potential tax income when students do not return. Approximately $730 million in potential tax revenue for the federal government never materializes (Schneider & Yin, 2011). Federal, state, and local appropriations lost to FTFT community college students who dropped out during the course of five academic years (2004-2005 through 2008-2009) totaled $4 billion (Schneider & Yin, 2011). According to Johnson (2012), thirty-three percent of expenditures at community colleges are associated with students who leave without completing a degree compared to half as much of the cost at public universities and a quarter of the expenditures at private universities. Age. It is not uncommon in education research to consider \"age\" as a factor in degree completion, and it is not uncommon to find mixed results. For example, Kolajo (2004), Napoli and Wortman (1998), and Porchea, Allen, Robbins, & Phelps (2010) discovered that the older a student was the greater the chances of degree completion. The conclusion regarding a student's age was contradictory to other literature that indicated that younger students had higher graduation rates Liu & Liu, 1999;Nakajima, Dembo & Mossler, 2012;Settle, 2010). Findings from Gantt (2010) were similar for graduates in the workforce education strands of accounting, business management, horticulture, and computer science at a community college in Texas where all graduates were between the ages of 21 and"}, {"section_title": "35.", "text": "Gender. The literature presents conflicting evidence of the predictive ability of gender as a determinant of degree attainment in community colleges, and the debate is still on-going. On the one hand, Gantt (2010), Craig and Ward (2008), Liu and Liu (1999), Perrakis (2008), and Sewell and Shah (1967) contended that there is no difference between the persistence and the graduation rates of men and women. Ko (2005) did not observe any gender differences in the 3year completion rates and Gantt (2010) found a low and insignificant relationship between gender and graduation rates among vocational students. Then, in sample of 178,985 students from 107 California community colleges in , Jaeger and Eagan (2009 found that women were 6% more likely than men to earn an associate's degree. Ethnicity. The enrollment of ethnic minorities is increasing on college campuses, as is interest in the ethnic background of students who depart and complete their programs. If looking at institutional graduation rates, they declined as minority enrollment increased at community colleges (Bailey et al., 2004;Jacoby, 2006;Kotamraju & Blackman, 2011). In closer examinations, it becomes evident that graduation rates and reasons for departure vary by ethnic background (Bailey et al., 2004;Cabrera, Terenzini, & Pascarella, 1999;Jaeger & Eagan, 2009;Ko, 2005). Findings point to lower completion rates among African Americans and Hispanics at community colleges (Bailey et al., 2004). Jaeger and Eagan (2009) found that Caucasians were 1% to 2% more likely than African Americans, Latinos, and \"other\" ethnicities to earn a degree. Programmatically speaking, graduation rates among African-American and Caucasian vocational students in Missouri's 2-year colleges were statistically significant (Ko, 2005). In Ko's (2005) study, no African Americans graduated during a 3-year period compared with 12.5% of Caucasians and 8.6% self-identified as \"Other.\" Nearly 82% of African Americans, 70% of \"other\" ethnicities, and 70% of Caucasians dropped out of vocational degree programs during the first 3 years (Ko, 2005). Collectively, academic ability and performance, goal and institutional commitment, parental encouragement, and perceptions of prejudicial practices accounted for 55% of the reasons for persistence in African American students and for 39% of the variance among the Caucasian students' decision to persist in college in a study by Cabrera et al. (1999). These types of differences, however, may be mitigated by location. Student outcomes were not directly influenced by ethnicity in the study by Perrakis (2008) of African American and Caucasian students in the Los Angeles Community College District."}, {"section_title": "GPA.", "text": "There is evidence to suggest that demographic variables are not the primary predictors of persistence in an associate's degree program. Exhaustive research established the positive effect of first-semester GPA on degree attainment at 2-year institutions. Jaeger and Eagan (2009) found that there was a 7% greater likelihood of a student persisting for each unit increase in GPA during the first year. There is also growing evidence of the positive correlation between cumulative GPA and associate's degree attainment (Craig & Ward, 2008;Jaeger & Eagan, 2009;Makuakane-Dreschel & Hagedorn, 2000;Nakajima et al., 2012). The strongest predictor in a stepwise regression of 1,729 full-time community college students graduating in 1998 by Craig and Ward (2008) was cumulative GPA followed by second-semester GPA. Cumulative GPA was also the strongest predictor from the multivariate logistic analysis of Nakajima et al. (2012) of 427 students at a southern California community college in the fall of 2007 and fall of 2008. Jaeger and Eagan (2009) found that there was a nearly 16% greater likelihood of a student earning an associate's degree for each unit increase in cumulative GPA. Unfortunately, Jaeger and Eagan (2009)  Developmental education. One of the core missions of the community college is the offering of developmental education programs (Bailey & Morest, 2004). A majority of community colleges offer at least one remedial course and require entering students to complete placement assessments such as math, reading, and writing (Shults, 2001). Nearly half of all freshmen of the 22-campus California State University's (CSU) new class in 1994 needed assistance in English or math prior to enrolling in college-credit courses (Ignash, 2002). This reflected the national trend of remedial enrollment where in 2000, forty-two percent of new students at community colleges and up to 24% at other colleges and universities registered in at least one developmental reading, writing, or math course (NCES, 2003). During their college career, at least half of community college students will take at least one remedial course (Bailey, Jeong, & Cho, 2009). On average, a student will enroll in one or two remedial courses; 46% complete the course(s) in less than one year, 90% take a full year to finish, and they are able to do just as well in standard college courses as their classmates who had not taken any remedial courses (Boylan, 1999;Day & McCabe, 1997;Kozeracki, 2002;Lake, 2001). Although developmental education programs aims to increase access to higher education, research on its overall effectiveness is mostly unreliable, suggestive, and consists of mixed results (Bailey et al., 2009). The student may not get over the initial shock of learning that their performance on the assessments(s) necessitates remediation affecting goals and motivation (Bailey et al., 2009). Among students who complete the requirement, a number of them do not persist in future terms of subsequent college-level coursework (Bailey, 2009). The need to take developmental coursework extends the anticipated time to graduation and places additional academic and financial burdens on students that subsequently reduces chances of degree completion (Bailey et al., 2009;D'Amico, Morgan, & Robertson, 2011). The student must enroll and pay for these additional units, and most often before beginning college-level coursework. Depending on financial aid policies, the student may use all, some, or none of the funds towards remedial education credits (Bailey et al., 2009). Upon completion of a developmental course, a majority of institutions only give the student institutional credit or no credit instead of applying the credit to his or her degree (Shults, 2001). These reasons may explain why students who do not need to complete developmental coursework are more likely to persist to degree attainment and graduate sooner (D'Amico et al., 2011). With respect to student retention and completion rates, there appears to be little success (Torraco, 2014). From a general linear regression model by D'Amico et al. 2011, significant predictors of degree attainment of the South Carolina Technical College System's workforce cluster were age, gender, developmental math coursework, and credits earned each semester. Females were more likely to graduate from these programs, and the chances of graduation were 2.63 times greater if developmental math was not needed, 1.4 times greater if the average number of credits earned each semester increased by one credit, and 0.96 times greater for every year increase in age (D'Amico, et al., 2011). In addition, when D'Amico et al. 2011constructed models for each workforce cluster, the coefficients varied and there were additional cluster-specific predictors that arose. Caucasians were 0.3 times less likely to graduate than African Americans, and the chances of graduating increased threefold for those not needing to take a developmental math course (D'Amico et al., 2011). Required enrollment in a developmental English course and residence in a \"distressed\" county were significant predictors for students in the advanced manufacturing program (D'Amico et al., 2011). Those who took one or more developmental math courses were 2.63 times less likely to graduate from one of the workforce clusters in South Carolina (D'Amico, 2011). Proponents may say that developmental education programs are ineffective at improving student outcomes from retention to degree attainment and employment; but there are findings that prove otherwise. First, it was shown that it is possible for enrollment in developmental education to improve retention rates to that higher than students who do not enroll (Fleischauer, 1996;Ramirez, 1997;Morante, 1986;Smith, O'Hear, Baden, Hayden, Gorham, Ahuja, and Jacobsen, 1996;Waycaster, 2001). In a 1995 longitudinal, comparison study of supplemental (SI) and non-supplemental instruction (NSI) students, Ramirez (1997) identified that those who participated in SI (i.e., students pre-identified as academically underprepared) had the highest persistence rates during the 8-semester study. What was most astonishing in the study were the 83% \"highly motivated\" and 78% \"low-motivated\" SI students who entered into the program as sophomores at the college. They remained in college and eventually graduated. As for the NSI group, only 53% persisted. Ten years after beginning developmental courses, 98% of students in the study by Lake (2001) who enrolled in the courses were employed and 90% were earning above the minimum wage. Nearly two-thirds were in technical and office careers (Lake, 2001). Secondary schooling. Just as developmental education has a pronounced presence in the college curriculum and research literature, high school performance is correspondingly scrutinized for its potential role in future educational attainment. Past academic performance and preparation in high school was correlated to persistence across higher education, and in some cases, the strongest or single predictor (Astin, 1999;Elkins, 2000;Feldman, 1993;Goble, Rosenbaum, & Stephan, 2008;Habley & McClanahan, 2004;McDaniel & Graham, 2001;Napoli & Wortman, 1998;Perrakis, 2008;Porchea et al., 2010;Tinto, 1975). Meaning, higher high school GPA's and more rigorous schoolwork are associated with higher college completion rates, and lower GPA's and weaker curricula associated with lower rates of completion. Horn and Kojaku (2001) studied the relationship between high school curricula and persistence in college and found that 78% of those who completed \"rigorous\" high school curricula consisting of 3 years of math, 3 years of social studies, 3 years of science, and 4 years of English persisted at their institutions. Similarly, Makuakane-Dreschel and Hagedorn (2000) found that CTE students who attended urban high schools, locations assumed by the researcher to have a heavier workload and better quality of education, were 36.2% more likely to persist in college compared with those who attended rural schools. Whereas the student characteristic rated as contributing the most to student attrition in Habley and McClanahan's study (2004) was \"inadequate preparation for college work,\" (p.12)."}, {"section_title": "Financial aid.", "text": "Whether it is in the form of loans, grants, federal tax credits, or another type of aid, most college students receive financial aid (Dynarski & Scott-Clayton, 2013). Twothirds of full-time students are grant recipients (Dynarski & Scott-Clayton, 2013). With such an abundance of information and existing accountability measures, even as of recent, there is still not enough rigorous research to support inquiries of which or whether student aid can help increase completion rates (Dynarski & Scott-Clayton, 2013). The limited number of predictive studies of the impact of financial aid on student outcomes produced inconclusive, mixed, and contradictory conclusions due to reasons such as different types of aid packages, debt load, debt aversion, geographic nuances, fluctuating state unemployment rates, and varying institutional policies (Gross, Zerquera, Inge, & Berry, 2014;Dowd & Coury, 2006;Dynarski & Scott-Clayton, 2013;Jacoby, 2006). It remains long-held that financial aid is positively linked to college completion and evidence exists to support the position. Several research studies documented the positive and significant effect of financial aid on completion (Gross et al., 2014;Bailey et al., 2004;Dynarski & Scott-Clayton, 2013). Gross et al. (2014) demonstrated that any amount and type of financial aid (i.e., need-based aid, loans, grants, work study, loans, and other aid) is positively and significantly associated with completion. Cofer and Somers (2001) concluded that the Reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1992, with its creation of the federally unsubsidized loan program and easier access to loans, allowed the students surveyed in their study attending 2-year colleges to persist to graduation. In Jaeger and Eagan (2009), students were 3% more likely to earn an associate's degree if they needed and received financial aid, but the researchers were not able to control for socioeconomic status because of inconsistencies in family and student income variables. Second to GPA, the most predictive variable of persistence for students pursuing CTE degrees in Hawaii community colleges was financial aid, at 24.9% (Makuakane-Dreschel & Hagedorn, 2000). Yet, the likelihood of graduating from an energy workforce cluster increased twofold if the student was not eligible for Pell Grants (Cofer & Somers, 2001). The probability of liberal arts students persisting with financial aid was predicted as having a 49.3% greater chance than students not receiving financial aid (Makuakane-Dreschel & Hagedorn, 2000). Financial aid in the study by Makuakane-Dreschel and Hagedorn 2000was not limited to subsidized and unsubsidized loans, fellowships, and grants. Similarly, Mendoza, Mendez, and Malcolm (2009) concluded in a study of second-year students enrolled in associate's degree programs at Oklahoma community colleges that Stafford loans, Pell grants, and Oklahoma state financial aid program (Oklahoma Higher Learning Access Program) in combination or alone were also predictive factors albeit moderated by income and ethnicity. Students attending 2-year colleges who already incurred a substantial amount of debt were more likely to persist than students, typically first-year or semester students, with low levels of debt (Horn & Berger, 2005;Cofer & Somers, 2001). Over the course of their postsecondary studies, nearly half of the students enrolled in Horn and Berger's (2005) study borrowed money. The thought of leaving college in debt may have motivated these students to stay enrolled, lest they want to start the repayment process, but such intentions were not studied (Horn & Berger, 2005). A common limitation among studies is the inability to control for student motivation behind applying for financial aid (Gross et al., 2014;Horn & Berger, 2005). Despite documented positive outcomes, financial aid could still be barriers to completion depending on the form of disbursement and length of time in school (Gross et al., 2014;Cofer & Somers, 2001;Guilleroy & Wolverton, 2008). Dowd and Coury (2006) only focused on subsidized loans in multivariate and logistical regression procedures with a sample of community college students in BPS: 90/94. They found loan reliance decreased associate's degree attainment levels over a 5-year span (Dowd & Coury, 2006). The positive effect of financial aid initially seen in Gross et al. (2014) was also observed to decrease over time. Additionally, inadequate financial aid packages and eligibility issues could be viewed as barriers to persistence (Gross et al., 2014;Dynarski & Scott-Clayton, 2013;Guilleroy & Wolverton, 2008). When Valeri-Gold, Kearse, Deming, Ericco, and Callahan (1999) interviewed 23 students and asked what was the greatest barrier in their collegiate career, 26% agreed that financial obligations was the greatest difficulty to overcome and had to work more hours to cover the cost of tuition. A little over half of the students (53%) received financial aid sometime during their academic career-forty-two percent in the form of the Hope Scholarship; but, only one student said he was able to maintain at least a B-average through graduation with a bachelor's degree. A second student said she maintained the B-average but her Hope Scholarship ended after she completed 130 hours of coursework-the maximum number of hours allowed under her state's provision. Gross et al. (2014) concluded that a student's financial needs cannot be met by grant aid and may affect the odds of degree completion. Degree attainment by Latinos who received financial aid in the study by Gross et al. (2014) were mixed because the likelihood of earning a degree decreased as total grant aid increased. Parents' educational attainment. Variables that positively affected first-to secondsemester persistence were high school academic achievement and parental education (Elkin, 2000). Following a sample of 3,582 sub-baccalaureate students from the Beginning Postsecondary Student Longitudinal Study of 1989-1994 (BPS: 89/04), Alfonso (2006) concluded that students whose parents held bachelor's degrees were 12% more likely to complete an associate's degree than those whose parents only earned a high school diploma (Alfonso, 2006). However, there are others such as Gantt (2010) who found family education background and graduation rates among CTE students to be insignificant."}, {"section_title": "Dependents.", "text": "The literature suggests that too many job and family demands, especially for single parents, and compounded by fewer financial resources, can significantly affect a student's persistence in college (Guilleroy & Wolverton, 2008;Habley & McClanahan, 2004). If the student had dependents, he or she was 87% less likely to persist, and if the student worked offcampus, he or she was 36% less likely to persist (Nora et al., 1996). Compared with students who entered college as parents, students who did not have a child when they started were 79% more likely to complete an associate's degree (Alfonso, 2006). While the highest level of education attained by parents and the students' own parental status were predictors in Alfonso's (2006) logistic regression, included in her operational definition of associate's degree completers were students who had transferred to 4-year institutions even though they did not receive the conferral. This detail can lead to misinterpretations of the findings because it cannot be determined which students fully completed the associate's degree curriculum and which were shy of graduating yet ably transferred. In contrast to previous literature cited in this sub-section, correlation coefficients calculated in Gantt (2010) found that students' number of dependent children and graduation rates among CTE students to be statistically insignificant. Degree goal and commitment. Given there is wide disagreement on the applications of social integration theories to the community college environment, it is not surprising that the researcher found correspondingly mixed results in the literature for those that use social integration and psychosocial variables. Among the assertions are that students that are more motivated, demonstrate academic discipline, and display stronger college commitment are more likely to earn a degree (Porchea et al., 2010;Lotkowski, Robbins, & Noeth, 2004). Lotkowski et al. (2004) found that self-confidence in the academic environment, academic goals, and academically related skills such as time management and study habits exerted the strongest positive influence on student persistence. Interestingly, when Porchea et al. (2010) considered distance between home and college as a form of commitment, those who traveled farther earned a degree. However, the social integration and psychosocial variables (i.e., academic goals, career goals, self-efficacy, social self-efficacy) used in Nakajima et al. 2012were not predictors. The NCES defined college degree commitment according to a student's college attendance intensity pattern and desire to either transfer to a 4-year institution or earn a college credential (Horn, Nevill, & Griffith, 2006). Horn et al. (2006) created the \"Community College Taxonomy\" using the two factors as a measure to further classify the commitment to degree completion of the 25,000 community college students that participated in the [2003][2004] National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS: 04). Nearly half (49%) of the study sample were considered \"More Committed,\" based on consistent enrollment of more than half time and reporting an intent to either transfer to a 4-year college or attain a community college degree or credential (Horn et al., 2006). Sixty-three percent of these students cited earning an associate's degree as a reason for attending community college. \"Less Committed\" students were registered in a degree program, but they did not meet the criteria of the first taxonomic level with continuous enrollment of half-time (Horn et al., 2006). Thirty-nine percent of students fell into this category. These students were characterized as disinterested in earning a sub-baccalaureate degree even though enrolled in a formal program (Horn et al., 2006). The most commonly cited reasons for attending community college were for personal reasons (54.8%), acquisition of job skills (41.7%), and completion of an associate's degree program (23.7) (Horn et al., 2006). Lastly, those classified as \"Not Committed\" constituted the remainder of the population (12%) because they were neither matriculated in a formal degree or credential program at the community college nor indicated intent to eventually transfer to a 4-year university (Horn et al., 2006). The most commonly cited reasons for attending community college was for personal reasons (55.6%), acquisition of job skills (41.7%), and completion of an associate's degree (22.6%) (Horn et al., 2006). Students who were older and less traditional tended to fall in either the \"Less Committed\" or \"Not Committed\" categories and enrolled in non-degree programs (Horn et al., 2006). 2001, forty-four percent attended a community college, but less than 30% graduated with an associate's degree (Tsapogas, 2004). Further, only 22% of all engineering bachelor's and master's graduates received an associate's degree, which is the lowest percentage of associate's degree conferrals compared to other science and engineering fields in the study (Tsapogas, 2004). Science and engineering graduates that previously attended at a community college were also more likely to be married females with children (Tsapogas, 2004). Survey respondents who graduated with a bachelor's or master's degree in 1997 and 1998 mentioned that the main reasons for enrolling at a community college was not to attain an associate's degree which ranked sixth of the nine reason options. The top two reasons for attending community college was to transfer credits to a bachelor's program (74%) and improve one's jobs skills and knowledge (50%) (Tsapogas, 2004). Wentling and Camacho (2008) pursued the following research question among female engineering majors: \"What factors have assisted women in deciding to pursue a degree in engineering?,\" (p. 86). Of the high school factors most commonly cited as influencing their decision, ninety-percent of survey respondents said that it was because of their individual performance in STEM classes, STEM classes taken in general (88%), excellent STEM teachers (73%), encouraging STEM teachers (55%), and participation in STEM-related extracurricular activities. Explicit content in engineering in some of these courses were said to be helpful in their decision to pursue engineering as a career (Wentling & Camacho, 2008). Of the family factors most commonly cited in the study as assisting in decision-making, forty-four percent (39 students) indicated the presence of a male (i.e., father, brother, uncle) engineering role model and 16% or 14 students indicated the presence of a female (i.e., mother, sister, aunt) engineering role model. In the same study, the most commonly cited factor that hindered the students during high school from pursuing an undergraduate degree in engineering was the lack of knowledge related to the engineering career (45%) (Wentling & Camacho, 2008). As high school students, almost half noted that they lacked career information that explained the nature of the work of engineers as compared to other social service jobs that may be more visible to the community or easier to explain in layman's terms; and along the same lines, thirty-nine percent stated school counselors provided little guidance with respect to engineering career options and opportunities and the standards for admissions into engineering programs (Wentling & Camacho, 2008). One participant in a follow-up focus group conducted by Wentling and Camacho (2008) of 24 female engineering majors stated of her high school, \"It was a great school academically, and I did really well, but I don't feel there was much help regarding careers. I really didn't even know what I was going to be doing when I started my engineering program,\" (Wentling & Camacho, 2008, p. 92). At the same time, another participant mentioned, \"It was that my high school was lacking in these areas [science and math] and I didn't have the background needed for engineering when I started my undergraduate degree program,\" (p. 93). Once an engineering college student, fifty-six percent of the original survey respondents questioned their career goals (Wentling & Camacho, 2008 undergraduate degree in engineering, mathematics, and computer science were explored. Women rated careers in education, social services, and medicine as more interesting than did men, thought they were less competent than men in the physical and mathematical science careers, perceived less opportunities in science and math for interpersonal involvement, and made career choices because of people-oriented reasons (Morgan et al., 2001). These findings could be supported by the 20% of former computer science majors surveyed by Bunderson and Christensen (1995) that changed majors to one that was more people-oriented. Attendance intensity. With the various possible attendance and enrollment statuses for community college students, a unique characteristic compared with other postsecondary institutions, it is necessary to include the category as a factor related to persistence in degree programs at these colleges. Enrollment in community colleges is consistently chaotic and intermittent with sporadic changes between full-time and part-time enrollment. Crosta (2013) identified 4,585 distinct patterns of enrollment among 14,429 students attending one of five community colleges. Students who attend on a full-time basis are predicted to be more likely to earn an associate's degree (Alfonso, 2006;Jaeger & Eagan, 2009;Porchea et al., 2010). The heavier the course load or the more credits a student enrolled in, the fewer the amount of terms the student needed to enroll in to graduate, the less likelihood there was of stopping-out, and the quicker he or she was be able to complete his or her degree program (Horn, 2010). If students were enrolled part-time or did not enroll for one term, the actual time-to-degree was longer (Grosset, 1993;Horn, 2010). The likelihood of degree attainment improved with each semester the student enrolled full-time (Alfonso, 2006). Interruption in enrollment at any time during the student's community college tenure decreased the likelihood of degree completion by 9% (Alfonso, 2006), and part-time students were more at risk for attrition (Alfonso, 2006;Jacoby, 2006;Jaeger & Eagan, 2009;Schmid & Abell, 2003). In Jaeger and Eagan (2009), students were 15% less likely to earn an associate's degree if they enrolled part-time. Almost half of students who did not earn a credential and departed Guilford Technical Community College (GTCC) between 2000 and 2001 said they simultaneously held full-time jobs and needed to reduce the amount of credit hours taken (Schmid & Abell, 2003). These students were 13% more likely to be financially independent compared to GTCC graduates (Schmid & Abell, 2003). Size. Research indicates that a college's size as well as ethnic make-up affects graduation rates (Bailey et al., 2004). A statistically significant factor from regressions predicting associate's degree completion rates at community colleges was the size of the institution (Alfonso, 2006;Bailey et al., 2004;Goble et al., 2008;Jacoby, 2006;Jaeger & Eagan, 2009). That is to say, the smaller the size of the college (i.e., a student body of 2,000 students or fewer), the higher the likelihood a student graduated with an associate's degree or earned enough units to transfer to a 4-year institution (Alfonso, 2006;. Conversely, there was a negative effect related to students in larger campuses where it was 16% less likely a student would graduate if the college's enrollment population were 2,001 to 10,000 (Alfonso, 2006). Similar to the dependent variable in Alfonso (2006), Goble et al. (2008) examined the completion rates of students with an associate's degrees or higher. Of the significant findings from Goble et al. (2008), college students categorized as high and middle achievers from high school test scores and attending colleges with 2,500 to 5,000 and 10,000 to 15,000 experienced higher completion rates. Related, lower graduation rates at colleges were found among campuses with larger percentages of ethnic minorities (Bailey et al., 2004;Kotamraju & Blackman, 2011). Location. Location of the of the college where the student is enrolled would be categorized as an institutional variable since it is indicative of state funding, employment rates, job prospects, programmatic availability, and socioeconomic conditions of the community. State unemployment rates as a dependent variable was statistically significant as a predictor to graduation rates; however, its effects are sensitive to local conditions (Jacoby, 2006). Significant for middle achievers in the study by Goble et al. (2008) were higher completion rates at colleges located in suburban than urban locations. To ascertain the effect to which year-to-year labor market shifts impact community college enrollment and degree attainment, Kienzl, Alfonso, and Melguizo (2007) analyzed timevariant explanatory variables (i.e., in-state tuition, Toblert and Sizer's commuting zones) and NELS: 88/2000 in a multi-level cost-benefit equation. Not surprising because of its design limitations, attrition from community college was not predicted in the model by average wages and in-state tuition, but the model did estimate associate's degree attainment to be higher at institutions that charge higher in-state tuition. The theoretical explanation behind the surprising result was that students view high tuition payments as an additional incentive to graduating before institutions decide to raise rates even higher (Kienzel et al., 2007). Major weaknesses to the study and equation were the exclusion of unemployment rates, student demographics, and other institutional variables and costs other than in-state tuition. Faculty. Numerous studies point to the negative impact of part-time faculty on persistence and associate's degree attainment at community colleges (Bailey et al., 2004;Goble et al., 2008;Jacoby, 2006;Jaeger & Eagan, 2009). The number of parttime faculty can negatively affect completion rates (Bailey et al., 2004;Goble et al., 2008;Jacoby, 2006). Based on a multiple regression model, Jacoby (2006) found a statistically significant and large negative impact on completion as the part-time faculty ratios increased at community colleges. The model explained 34-36% of the variance (Jacoby, 2006). After Jaeger and Eagan (2009) controlled for student background characteristics in a hierarchical generalized linear model, the researchers concluded that a greater presence of part-time faculty decreased the likelihood of associate's degree completion. If the exposure to part-time faculty increased by 10%, the probability of attaining an associate's degree decreased by 1%. This finding was meaningful considering that part-time faculty taught 40-60% of the course units earned by more than 9,000 students (Jaeger & Eagan, 2009). In contrast, Porchea et al. (2010) found that degree attainment could not be significantly predicted by a greater number of full-time faculty. Another inconsistency found in the literature was that there was no direct correlation between both formal and informal faculty interaction and a student's intent to persist or persistence to degree completion, but faculty concern was a significant predictor (Tovar, 2014;Nakajima et al., 2012). Previous studies of faculty involvement did not categorize students by concentration except in Gantt (2010). Findings from the survey of horticulture, computer science, accounting, and business management students by Gantt (2010) revealed a higher graduation rate 71%among respondents that agreed on the positive influence of access to faculty during office hours. Related, filing an official degree plan (i.e., an advising tool documenting progress to degree) was significantly correlated with graduation rates among CTE students (Cramer's V = 0.265, p = 0.020) (Gantt, 2010). In Gantt 2010 to a 4-year university. Students interviewed provided positive feedback to the plan expressing how creating, keeping focused, and seeing their own progress on the academic pathway saved them time and money (Starobin & Laanan, 2008). Support services. Closer examinations of campus support services (i.e., counseling, advising) and special programs (i.e., dual enrollment, summer bridge, mentoring) finds positive influences of these programs on the student participant's intentions to persist and outcomes (Karp, 2015;Douglas & Attewell, 2014;Tovar, 2014;Kolenic, Linderman, & Karp, 2013;Jaeger & Eagan, 2009;Guilleroy & Wolverton, 2008;Cedja & Rhodes, 2004;Habley & McClanahan, 2004;Lotkowski et al., 2004;Tinto, 1997). Among the 2-year public institutions that completed the 2003 Institutional Data Questionnaire by Habley and McClanahan (2004), fifty-five \"high performing\" colleges (i.e., those with high three-year degree completion rates) reported using math centers/labs; writing centers/labs; reading centers/labs; advising interventions with special student populations; learning communities; foreign language centers; and, programs for ethnic minorities at nearly 10% to 25% more than low performing colleges (Habley & McClanahan, 2004). Support services where the goal is to increase graduation rates are counseling and advising. It was shown in past studies to be influential to both students who need and do not need remedial education (Linderman & Kolenic, 2013). In the study conducted by Kolenic et al. (2013) the most significant predictor of 2-year graduation among City University of New York's Accelerated Study in Associate Programs (ASAP) students was advising. The three-year graduation rate for the initial cohort was 30% versus the comparison group's graduation rate of 11% (Linderman & Kolenic, 2013). ASAP includes features such as a cohort design, block scheduling, summer and winter sessions, remedial education (if needed), and mandatory support services (i.e., academic assistance, advising, career development). However, a major limitation of the quasi-experimental design was that the first ASAP cohort was not representative of the general community college student population since only 28% of study participants needed and completed remedial coursework prior to enrolling in ASAP, students did not need additional remediation while in ASAP, and full-time enrollment was required (Kolenic et al., 2013). A majority of the students accepted for subsequent cohorts did need remedial education. Still, ASAP was impactful for the second cohort with a three-year graduation rate as 55% versus the comparison group's graduation rate of 22% (Linderman & Kolenic, 2013). Along with advising, research and publication of past success of formal mentoring programs at community colleges indicates its ability to improve persistence (Cejda & Rhodes, 2004). Examples of mentoring activities include teaching, modeling, coaching, advising on the daily, transferring tacit knowledge, career counseling and development, assisting with employment, serving as a role model, and building trust (Cejda & Rhodes, 2004). A mentoring component is found in most, but not all, curricula of occupational or work-based learning programs such as apprenticeships, cooperative education, professional-clinical training, and internships (Stromei, 2000;Bragg & Griggs, 1997;Price, Graham, & Hobbs, 1997). In these programs, all parties involved (i.e., student, employer, and college) benefit through reciprocal feedback, students gain on-the-job experience and in some instances, pay, and employers get assistance at the workplace with the student-employee (Stromei, 2000;Price et al., 1997). However, student persistence could not be predicted by mentoring, social integration, and institutional and goal commitment variables by (Crisp, 2000). Crisp (2000)  While support services are available to the entire student population, the effect of support strategies on the associate's degree attainment of CTE students is encouraging yet hardly looked at or attempted in research. Gantt (2010) was one who conducted a correlation analysis of the engagement in student activities. Overall, a higher graduation rate (81.8%) was associated with CTE students who did not participate in student activities; and, of students who graduated within three years from CTE programs eighty-four percent did not participate in student organizations."}, {"section_title": "Current National Initiatives and Recommendations", "text": "In 2009, President Barack Obama proposed the American Graduation Initiative. The overarching goal of the initiative is for the United States to regain the number one position as the country with proportionally the most college graduates. The Obama administration intends to achieve the goal by reforming and strengthening community colleges through investments that help 5 million students attain associate's degrees and certificates by 2020 (The White House, 2009). While there are doubts that the 2020 goal can be reached because of the re-allocation of previously earmarked funds and budget cuts to public higher education, the need to increase community college completion rates had been brought to the national forefront. Following the announcement of President Obama's education agenda, in 2011, the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) announced its own initiative, the 21 st -Century Initiative. The AACC's initiative mirrors the goal of the Obama administration's initiative in that it aims to raise the number of community-college-credentialed students by 5 million or by 50%. Phase 1 involved a listening tour to gather of information from 1,300 stakeholders about student success, approaches to budget issues, the future direction of community colleges, college accountability, and ways the AACC could support its members. Phase 2 saw the creation of the 21 st -Century Commission on the Future of Community Colleges, and the presentation of the final report from Phase 1. According to the commission, in order for campuses to increase student completion and provide a sustainable workforce with community college credentials, there needs to be an institutional transformation (AACC, 2012). Recommendations on methods of re-imagining the nature of community colleges fall into the one of the 3 R's: 1) Redesigning the student's educational experiences, 2) Reinventing the roles of the institutions, and 3) Resetting the structure by creating incentives for student and institutional achievements, (AACC, 2012, n.p.). Ideally, the re-imagined college is one that implements the following strategies (AACC, 2012, n.p.): 1. Greets each entering student genuinely and coaches students for personalized evaluations of college readiness 2. Requires students to complete on-campus orientations and offers opportunities for student-campus community engagement 3. Offers first-semester advising to students to assist with goal setting and planning. 4. Creates a mandated, first-term student success course for all or most new students and encourages early registration in a formal program of study 5. Assists students with locating developmental education instruction to supplement curricula that was redesigned to incorporate previous training into college credentials 6. Aligns student support services with the needs and daily lives of college students, and integrates student support services with redesigned academic pathways 7. Promotes active learning and engagement between students as well as students and teachers 8. Ensures the quality of the college credentials by assessing student learning outcomes in fundamental courses 9. Promotes a \"culture of evidence,\" lead by community college administration with direct knowledge of and access to student and institutional progress reports. In addition to initiatives and recommendations aimed at increasing institutional completion rates, there are STEM programmatic initiatives meant to be impactful for students After assessing NSF/ATE supported centers and projects, Hull (2012) identified the following promising practices that address the challenges related to completion in technician programs: 1. Colleges create accelerated \"academies\" and student cohorts within them. 2. College technical programs offer bridge programs to high school students. 3. Colleges allow students to co-enroll in developmental courses while taking credit courses and in developmental mathematics specific to their majors, if possible. 4. High school students enroll in dual or concurrent STEM college courses. 5. Colleges, high schools, and other partners collaboratively host a range of STEM related experiences for students (e.g., summer camps, competitions, after-school programs); 6. Schools and programs hire counselors specializing in STEM"}, {"section_title": "Conceptual Framework", "text": "Student completion and attrition can be examined from four main models of student departure-economic, psychological, organizational, and interactional (Starks, 1989). Economic Models presuppose that students contemplate the opportunity cost(s), primarily the monetary costs and benefits of a college education. Students who do not complete college are perceived as neglectful or unaware of the other benefits and increases in human capital that a college education can provide. Psychological Models start with the assumption that a student's personality was set in stone before he or she entered the college and behavioral tendencies are unchangeable (Starks, 1989). If this is true, the social and academic components of the overall college environment will have little impact on departure, enrollment, and completion. Organizational Models examine the effect, influence, and relationship that the institution (e.g., size, mission, faculty to student ratio, resources, and governance structure) has with a student's academic and social integration (Starks, 1989). However, according to Bean (1980), the organization accounted for less than 20% of the variance in students who dropped out of college. This leads researchers to conclude the existence of other contributing factors in addition to the institution. That perspective in education research is held in Interactional Models and looks at the factors (e.g., the economic situation and pre-enrollment characteristics of the student, type of institution) used in each of the previously mentioned models as impacting student outcomes such as completion and non-completion (Starks, 1989).  Tinto (1993) described retention as a longitudinal decision-making process influenced by student and institutional characteristics. Specifically, behaviors of completion and departure are a result of the individual's demographic and precollege attributes, finances, goals and commitments, institutional experiences, and integration (Tinto, 1993). While the components related to student departure (i.e., student and institutional) are also present in completion, their influences and interactions are yet to be determined for completion at community colleges (Tinto, 2012). Astin's Theory of Student Involvement was the result of a longitudinal study that sought to identify the factors that affected student persistence in college (Astin, 1991). Further, he believed educational outcomes and specific means used to achieve the educational outcomes are causally related. Lenning (1977) and colleagues from the National Center for Higher Education Management System (NCHEMS) created an \"Outcomes Structure\" that captured five major categories of \"types-of-outcomes\": Economics; human; knowledge, technology, and art form; resource and service provision; and, other maintenance and change. Similarly, another widely referenced typology of student outcomes was the taxonomy developed by Astin and associates distinguishable from others with the implied interdependency between two dimensions of type of outcome (i.e., cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes) and type of data (i.e., observable and psychometrically measured behaviors) (Ewell, 1983). Astin (1991) subsequently applied the typology developed by he and his colleagues and proposed an approach to measuring student outcomes along the dimensions. Astin (1985) and his colleges suggested an approach to examine student outcomes in which student outcomes are a direct function of inputs and inputs plus the environment. Known as the \"Input-Environment-Outcome\" (I-E-O) model, the \"I\" in the I-E-O triangular model stands for Inputs that are the student's personal qualities that he or she enters the educational context with and would be used in research studies as an independent variable for those employing the model (Astin, 1991). This includes the student's demographic background, academic performance (past and present), and pre-college experiences. \"E\" is the Environment, and would also be used as an independent variable (Astin, 1991). Examples include student and faculty population demographics, academic and social programs, experiences in college, and institutional and programmatic characteristics. Lastly, \"O\" or Outcomes, are the intended \"talents\" that the institution or program wants to develop or influence (i.e., college completion), and would be considered the dependent or criterion variable(s) (Astin, 1991). Omitting one of the three constructs in research renders the model incomplete, generates results that are ambiguous, biased, or difficult to interpret, and subsequent policy and programmatic decisions are misinformed and ineffective (Astin, 1991). In the relationship among the I-E-O variables, evaluations and assessments of education often focus more on the relationship between the Environment and the Output than the relationship between the Input and the Environment (Astin, 1991). Moreover, Astin (1991) advises that it is not possible to learn about what environmental experiences can be controlled or changed and the extent to improve student outcomes without considering the Input-Environment relationship and Input-Output relationship because students may choose different educational environments and differences in student characteristics are correlated with time. For example, institutions or program leaders pressured with increasing performance, diversity, graduation rates, and enrollment numbers may start with making the change to the environment by way of one or more of the general sources of influences to the outputs (i.e., in-class experiences and outof-class experiences), but fail to accurately account for the range of student background traits. Bailey et al. (2004) suggested that probabilities of completion are more tied to student than institutional characteristics. Among the findings by Bailey et al. (2004) using student data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS: 88) and institutional data from IPEDS, students with more financial resources and are well-prepared are likely to persist regardless of the type of institution. Along those lines, even in strong colleges would students with personal and financial responsibilities still encounter problems (Bailey et al., 2004). Most of the existing research on community college completion focuses on the impact of a single variable with few incorporating more than one variable (Nakajima et al., 2012;Sexton, 1965). Since a single variable cannot predict attrition and persistence, the present study considers the two factors (i.e., student and institutional) from Tinto's Student Integration Model that were found to be associated with completion (Nakajima et al., 2012;Tinto, 2012;Summers, 2003;Tinto, 1993). The same student variables (i.e., demographic background, academic performance [past and present], and pre-college conditions and experiences) and institutional variables (i.e., student and faculty population demographics, academic and social programs, and institutional and programmatic characteristics) described by Tinto (1993) were also present in Astin's model. The first research question in this research study takes a closer look at the selected student characteristics to identify the characteristics of completers and non-completers. Question 2 examines how the student and institutional variables impact the \"Outputs\" of completion and non-completion. Building upon Question 2, Question 3 seeks to answer the query on the extent to which student-related and institutional variables can predict the \"Outputs\" of completion in a specific occupational, degree program. "}, {"section_title": "Summary of the Literature Review", "text": "The research study identified a gap in the literature on students who earn associate's degrees in engineering and engineering technologies programs at community colleges. There is an extensive amount of literature on attrition from community colleges and research focused on the characteristics of the students who depart without a degree conferral. Further, previous studies on community college non-completion and completion explored either student or institutional factors. These factors include student characteristics such as demographic background and pre-college and post-secondary school performance, as well as institutional characteristics related to the size of student and faculty populations, location, finances, and support services and programs. However, the influences and interactions between these student and institutional factors are unknown for completion at community colleges and specific associate's degree programs. Furthermore, lacking in the literature are descriptions of students who graduate from occupational strands including those that are currently experiencing a shortage in the workplace, in this case, engineering and engineering technologies. Due to the absences mentioned above, seminal theories of student outcomes may not be able to fully explain the phenomenon of completion in sub-baccalaureate STEM degree programs. Still, they informed the present study because they suggested further research into the student-related and institutional variables shown to impact outcomes in higher education. As such, the empirical works served to ground the conceptual framework constructed by the researcher and guide the research methodology for the study dictated in Chapter Three."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER THREE: RESEARCH METHODS", "text": "Described in this chapter is the methodology for the investigation of the variables related to the completion of associate's degrees in engineering and engineering technologies.

In an ex post facto design, research is non-experimental meaning that there is no manipulation or intervention by the researcher on the attribute independent variable(s) or the participant's characteristics prior to the study (Ary, Jacobs, Sorensen, & Walker, 2013;Gall, Gall, & Borg, 2007;Leedy & Ormrod, 2012). In addition, non-experimental research is more amenable to variables of interest such as those used in studies where random assignment of subjects not possible (Ary et al., 2013). As part of developing the ex post facto design, at least two groups for comparison must be identified (Ary et al., 2013). For the purposes of this study the two groups are completers and non-completers of associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies. The researcher then determines whether the ex post facto research will be proactive or retroactive (Ary et al., 2013). The research in this study was retroactive ex post facto because the focus was on \"the possible antecedent causes (independent variables) for a preexisting dependent variable,\" (Ary et al., 2013, p. 360). The examination of the phenomena of completion and non-completion occurs after the fact or presumed cause retroactively using existing or secondary data (Leedy & Ormrod, 2012). There is still knowledge waiting to be discovered in the secondary data (Glass, 1976). Secondary data analysis is explained by Glass (1976) as, \"the re-analysis of data for the purpose of answering the original research question with better statistical techniques, or answering new questions with old data,\" (p. 3). In this study, new research questions were answered using secondary data (BPS:04/09) and the data was analyzed using a new statistical tool (PowerStats). as reliable after a random sample major/field of study data were recoded."}, {"section_title": "About the Data Source", "text": "Four weighted measures were used for different types of data records: 1) for study respondents to the BPS:04/09 study, 2) for study respondents that participated since the base year NPSAS:04 study (panel or longitudinal weights), 3) to be used in cases with transcript-level data, and, 4) for study respondents that participated in all 3 BPS surveys (2004,2006,2009) with transcript-level data (panel or longitudinal weight). The weights for BPS:04/09 cases and panels were initially based off of the weights determined from the first follow-up study (BPS:04/06). The non-response models were checked for overall predictive capability, or the ability to classify students by response type, by using an ROC curve. After the data underwent stringent quality control mechanisms, cleaning, and coding, the final primary analysis file for BPS:04/09 that was adjudicated and allowed for public-use in 2010 via PowerStats includes 16,680 study respondents and 1,500 variables. BPS: 04/09 is valuable to researchers and most appropriate for the design of the proposed study because it, \"provides researchers with contextual data that allows for predicting graduation rates,\" (Cook & Pullaro, 2010, p. 17). In contrast to other available datasets, such as Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) in which the focus is on the institution, the purpose of the BPS is to follow students and the targeted population of this study is the student population (Cook & Pullaro, 2010). The BPS: 04/09 dataset included the dependent variables that will be used in this study: degree attainment with after 3 years of enrolling and degree attainment after six years of enrolling. Further, BPS: 04/09 provided nationally representative samples of the subpopulations of interest, in this case engineering and engineering technologies students, from which findings are highly generalizeable (Greenhoot & Dowsett, 2012). Administrative data sources (e.g., IPEDS; NSC; institution, system-level, and state management systems; and, unemployment insurance wage databases) were not accessed by the researcher because they presented significant challenges in comprehensively accounting for and accurately analyzing community college student attributes, institutional characteristics, and outcomes. Each administrative data source has its own respective purpose and goal; different reasons for participant inclusion and exclusion; varying methodologies of reporting by institution, system, and state; and, may be subject to additional restrictions associated with the Family Education Right to Privacy Act (FERPA), (Cook & Pullaro, 2010;National Research Council, 2012). Unlike the administrative data sources, the BPS: 04/09 dataset is inclusive of the most student-related variables identified in the literature as impacting community college student outcomes. BPS: 04/09 collected self-reported, student data to track student enrollment, changes to enrollment, and non-enrollment across different types of institutions and states in addition to gathering contextual, personal information unique to those attending community college (Cook & Pullaro, 2010;NRC, 2012). A dataset such as IPEDS would not be an appropriate source of the student-related variables and outcomes since institutions only report enrollment information on first-time, full-time (FTFT) students for the federally mandated survey. As it pertains to the selection criteria for student-related variables, the BPS: 04/09 dataset may not include all of the student-related and institutional variables mentioned in the literature because of the restrictive survey questions or the data only applied other student populations (e.g., students attending 4year institutions). One advantage of using the BPS: 04/09 dataset is that the NCES already sourced data from the administrative sources as part of its own research methodology. Institutional variables selected for use in this study from the BPS: 04/09 dataset were sourced by NCES from IPEDS by way of the NPSAS: 04's mathematically complex institutional sampling design. However, one limitation of IPEDS, the originating survey for institutional data, is that it encompasses distinct reporting methodologies that do not include items pertaining to ancillary services and programs and other institutional statistics specific to individual community colleges (e.g., faculty office hours, faculty-student ratios). As was the case with student-related variables and the BPS: 04/09 survey, if the institutional information were not reported on the IPEDS survey, the potential variables were excluded from the BPS: 04/09 dataset and omitted as part of the present study's methodology. Findings from the large, longitudinal dataset (BPS) and use of PowerStats as the interface and analytical tool are still low-cost and high-quality (Greenhoot & Dowsett, 2012). As such, use of PowerStats is becoming increasingly common in postsecondary education research since its release in 2010 (Pontes & Pontes, 2012a;Pontes & Pontes, 2012b;Radford, 2010;Sparks & Malkus, 2013;Swail, 2011;Wood, 2011;Wood, 2012). Furthermore, use of PowerStats include but are not limited to statistical analyses in dissertations interested in higher education outcomes (Collins, 2012;Comeau, 2012;English, 2012;Filerino, 2013;Kincaid, 2013;Maliwesky, 2012;McGee, 2011;McKean, 2011;Metcalfe, 2012;Ruot, 2013;Scarbrough, 2012;Strahn-Koller, 2012)."}, {"section_title": "Population and Sample", "text": "The BPS:04/09 sampling design was a two-stage process that started with an un-clustered sample of eligible institutions from the NPSAS: 04. Weighting. Complex sample designs with large-scale data collection methods, as in the case of national datasets like BPS: 04/09, yield itself to issues such as unequal subject representation or oversampling, non-response bias, and errors in population parameter estimates (Dey, 1997;Hahs-Vaughn, 2006;Hahs-Vaughn, 2005;Thomas & Heck, 2001). Therefore, when analyzing data from complex samples, it is highly recommended to use sample weights (Dey, 1997;Hahs-Vaughn, 2006;Hahs-Vaughn, 2005;Thomas & Heck, 2001). The survey design of BPS: 04/09 (and previous BPS survey cohorts) required the development of 3 statistical analysis weights as estimation methods for cases of non-response. The weights were used to adjust for non-response bias, control totals, ensure population representation, and maintain consistency with NPSAS: 04 and BPS: 04/06. Weights in BPS: 04/09 were initially derived from NPSAS: 04 weights. The first weight created was to address data from 16,700 BPS:04/09 study respondents (i.e., sample members with data from the BPS: 04/09 student interview or enrollment data sourced externally) that enrolled during the 2003-2004 academic year and were study respondents at the end of the 2008-2009 academic year. Imputation was necessary for missing interview data in 2006. In the BPS: 04/09 data file in PowerStats, the variable labeled \"WTA000\" is the response-adjusted, calibrated weight and the non-response weight adjustment factors range from 0.79 to 1.37. The second weight, the panel or longitudinal weight, was created to analyze data from approximately 16,100 study respondents in NSPAS:04, BPS:04/06, and BPS:04/09. In the BPS: 04/09 data file in PowerStats, the panel weight is the variable labeled \"WTB000\" and the nonresponse weight adjustment factors range from 0.69 to 1.46. The third analysis weight was for 17,000 eligible study respondents in the BPS: 04/09 with only transcript data and the variable labeled \"WTC000\" is the response-adjusted, calibrated weight. Weight adjustment factors for WTC000 range from 0.67 to 1.23. A fourth, existing weight, was also used to calibrate data used in the longitudinal analysis of the BPS 2004surveys and 2009. This weight included 15,000 students with transcripts who were study respondents in the 2003-2004 academic year as well as three and six years later. To calculate the item response rate for variables, the number of participants that responded to an item was divided by the number of participants without a reason to skip the item. The weight, labeled \"WTD000,\" include adjustment factors ranging from 0.08 to 9.32. Before generating any table or regression output, PowerStats will make a recommendation on the appropriate weight the research should use based on the researcherselected variables and the variable's data source."}, {"section_title": "Variables", "text": "The researcher explored the variables most commonly referenced in the literature and measurable among the student population and institutions within the scope of the dataset. The independent and dependent variables used for inclusion in this study were derived from the previous studies of completion and non-completion using BPS variable data (Bryan, B., 2013;Dowd & Coury, 2006;Filerino, 2013;McGee, 2011;McKean, 2011;Ruot, 2013;Settle, 2011;Strahn-Koller, 2012). In addition, the treatment of the variables were guided by the seminal works outlined by theorists Vincent Tinto (1993) and Alexander Astin (1991) that informed the conceptual framework in Figure 1, Chapter Two. The research study used the dependent (degree attainment) and independent (studentrelated and institutional) variables from the BPS: 04/09 and are listed in Table 1. Gender was a categorical, independent variable in this study in which there are 2 levels, male and female. This information was first collected from NPSAS: 04 student interviews, if available, then the CADE system and CPS: 04. Race/ethnicity was also a categorical variable in which the information was sourced from the NPSAS: 04 student interviews and based off of census categories. The nine race/ethnicity levels include White, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian / other Pacific Islander, Other, and More than one race. Marital status as of 2004 was a categorical variable sourced from the CPS:04, NPSAS:04 student interview, NPSAS:04 CADE and reflected the student's martial status when first enrolled. It included the following three categories: single, divorced, or widowed; married; and, separated. Grade point average 2003-04, or the GPA after the first year of enrollment, was selected for use in this study and was used as a continuous variable. GPA data was first reported by institutions in CADE followed by the student-reported GPA in the NPSAS: 04 student interviews if missing from CADE, and then standardized to a 4.00 scale. Cumulative GPA was identified using the categorical variable \"Grade point average estimate when last enrolled thru 2009.\" Institutional data for the [2008][2009] was not yet reported at the time of the BPS: 04/09 public dataset release, or for those students who completed their degree six years after first enrolling therefore they were estimated by the student.  Remedial course 2004: Any taken (e.g., English, math, reading, study skills, writing), was also a categorical independent variable in this study, sourced from student interviews. For this independent variable, if the student did not take any remedial or developmental courses during the 2003-2004 academic year they served as the reference group. Income group 2003-04 was a categorical variable and was sourced from NPSAS:04 student interview, CPS 2004. There were four categorical groupings: Low, low middle, high middle, and high. The four categories were quartile approximations of the parent's income (if the student was a dependent at the time) or the income of the independent student (and spouse). For the purposes of this study, all students with the suffixes \"attained AA\" and \"with AA\" were considered completers. Students that did not earn a degree and those that earned a certificate were considered non-completers."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis", "text": "PowerStats was the data analysis tool used to calculate descriptive statistics (i.e., percentage distributions, averages) and inferential statistics (logistic regression) for the study.  GPA 2003GPA -2004, and GPA estimate when last enrolled thru 2009 was selected from the list of \"All Variables\" from the BPS: 04/09 dataset and each placed in the \"Column Variable\" section. The variable, \"Community college student 6-year retention and attainment 2009,\" was placed into the \"Row Variable\" section. Only students who earned an AA (i.e., from the categories \"Not enrolled, attained AA,\" \"Enrolled, attained AA,\" and \"Transferred with AA\") were included. The \"Filter\" feature was used by placing the variable \"Transcript: First Associate's degree field of study: 2-digit CIP\" in the filter box and selecting the CIP codes 14 and 15. These steps ensured that the results only included students that earned an associate's degree in engineering and engineering technologies from community colleges. Based on the variables used in the averages To conduct the analyses of genders for completers of engineering and engineering technologies from community colleges, a new percentage distribution table was created from the BPS:04/09 dataset in PowerStats. \"Gender\" was selected from the list of \"All Variables\" from the BPS: 04/09 dataset and placed for use as a \"Column Variable.\" The variable, \"Community college student 6-year retention and attainment 2009,\" was placed into the \"Row Variable\" section. Only students who earned an AA (i.e., \"Not enrolled, attained AA,\" \"Enrolled, attained AA,\" \"Transferred with AA\") were included. The \"Filter\" feature was used by placing the were the most appropriate statistical techniques to use (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2010). Logistic regression is one of the most common methods to analyze educational outcomes in higher education. This method can \"predict the probability of an event occurring\" and identify statistically significant continuous and categorical independent variables impacting dichotomous dependent variables at the same time (Hair et al., 2010, p. 318;McGrath & Braunstein, 1997). In the present study, the events examined were completion and non-completion. The probabilities of these two outcomes as impacted or effected by the independent variables were expressed as odds ratios (Hair et al., 2010). The process of the logistic regression analyses in PowerStats was consistent with the recommendations by Peng, Lee, and Ingersoll (2002a) and Peng, So, Stage and St. John (2002b). To ensure the adequacy of the predicted probabilities, the following must take place: 1) Using the Wald chi-square to test statistical significance of individual predictors (\u03b2's); and, 2) Performing inferential, goodness-of-fit statistics (Peng et al., 2002a;Peng et al., 2002b). What was identified was the impact of selected student-related and institutional independent variables on associate's degree completion three years and six after students entered 2-year, public community colleges. To conduct the analyses, logistic regression tables were created. The student-related variables were entered into the model as the independent variables followed by the entering of the dependent variable, \"Community college student 3-year retention and attainment 2006.\" Only students who attained an AA (i.e., \"Not enrolled, attained AA,\" \"Enrolled, attained AA,\" \"Transferred with AA\") were included, and the data was filtered to view results for only engineering and engineering technologies programs. Based on the variables used in the logistic regression, PowerStats recommended the use of the weight WTB000. The logistic regression function in PowerStats calculated the estimated standardized regression coefficients, odds ratios, measures of goodness-of-fit (i.e., Pseudo R 2 and likelihood testing), and results of hypothesis testing (WaldF). Standardized coefficients (\u03b2s), or the natural logarithm, and confidence intervals for odds ratios were reported in order to answer question 2. Beta values were useful in predicting whether the student is a completer or non-completer of associate's degrees based on the selected student-related and institutional variables. The log-odds ratios were useful in determining the direction of the impact (positive or negative) the predictors make on the criterions. They represented, \"the proportional change in the probability that the dependent variable equals one for each additional unit of the independent variable,\" (NCES, 2010, n.p.). After the initial logistic regression was performed, the institutional variables were included in the model as independent variables in addition to the student-related variables. Pseudo R 2 values indicated the proportion of the variance in the criterion that was associated with our predictor variables. It assesses the overall model fit (Hair et al., 2010;Peng et al., 2002a;Peng et al., 2002b). Likelihood and Wald statistics indicated which variables or individual predictors are statistically significant contributors to the models of predicting completion in engineering and engineering technologies (Hair et al., 2010;NCES, 2010). The \"WaldF\" test result is the same as the F-statistic, is derived from the Wald chi-square, and analogous to a t-test in linear regression whereby the logistic coefficient of the independent variables are tested for significance (Hair et al., 2010)."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "This study used secondary data from the National Center for Education Statistics' \nThis chapter began with a review of the purpose, research questions, and methods of the research study followed by the results from the data analyses of the BPS: 04/09 dataset. identified the variables significant to the models and standardized beta weights determined the impact of the significant, independent variables on the dependent variables."}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of Completers and Non-completers", "text": "The aim of the first research question was to identify the characteristics of completers and non-completers of associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies.

The average age was higher for non-completers enrolled in community college engineering and engineering technologies programs at 23.9 years of age. Outcomes by student demographics. For the weighted sample of students in all associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies, the percentage distributions for attendants and their outcomes according to the demographic variables of gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, income group 2003-04, and job while enrolled 2004 are listed in Table 4. As evidenced in Table 4, a majority of attendants of associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies were male (90%) with females in the minority at 10%. While males attended the programs at a higher proportion than did females, completion rates were comparable. About 30% of both genders attained the degree during the study, while 70% did not complete the degree program. As further detailed in compared to the other racial/ethnic groups. In addition, Table 4 shows that single, divorced, or widowed represented 90.32%, married students comprised 9.27%, and separated students made up 0.42% of all attendees in associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies programs. Attendees who were married when they first began the program experienced higher rates of completion (42.93%) than did attendees with other marital statuses. Among single, divorced, or widowed, over one-quarter or 27.65% attained the degree, while no attendees (0.00%) with separated marital status earned the degree. As evidenced in   completed that degree in engineering and engineering technologies. The group with the second highest proportion of completers were attendees whose fathers earned a high school diploma or equivalent (38.85%), followed by fathers who had: a) vocational or technical training (37.58%), b) a bachelor's degree (34.19%), c) an unknown education level (29.62%), d) a doctoral degree or equivalent (26.65%), e) less than a high school diploma (23.46%), f) two or more years of college but no degree (9.39%), g) a master's degree (7.66%), and h) less than two years of college (3.63%). While the population of attendees whose father's highest level of education was the firstprofessional degree (0.35%), they were also the group with the highest percent of noncompletion (100%). The proportions of non-completing attendees, according to father's highest level of education, included: a) less than two years of college (96.37%), b) a master's degree (92.34%), c) two or more years of college but no degree (90.61%), d) a doctoral degree or equivalent (73.35%), e) an unknown education level (70.38%), f) a bachelor's degree (65.81%), g) vocational or technical training (62.42%), h) a high school diploma or equivalent (61.15%), and i) an associate's degree (31.05%). Similar to their father's information, students whose mother's highest level of education was a high school diploma or equivalent made up 36.99% of all attendees in associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies. Comparatively, students whose mothers earned a bachelor's degree represented the second highest proportion of attendees (13.99%), followed by attendees whose mothers did not complete high school (9.68%), and the following: a) an associate's degree (8.88%), b) less than two years of college (7.63%), c) a master's degree (6.76%), d) vocational or technical training (5.42%), e) two or more years of college but no degree (5.39%), f) a doctoral degree or equivalent (0.69%), and g) a first-professional degree (0.21%). Approximately 4.35% of attendees did not know their mother's education level. Coincidentally, this group of attendees also experienced the highest rate of completion (45.92%). The group with the second highest proportion of completers had mothers that undertook vocational or technical training (42.53%), followed by mothers with: a) a doctoral degree or equivalent (39.98%), b) an associate's degree (38.42%), c) a high school diploma or equivalent (37.66%), d) non-completion of high school (32.07%), e) a master's degree (31.38%), f) a bachelor's degree (19.79%), g) two or more years of college but no degree (7.42%), and h) less than two years of college (5.64%). The population of attendees whose mother's highest level of education was the firstprofessional degree (0.21%) were also the group with the highest percent of non-completion (100%), following by: a) less than two years of college (94.36%), b) two or more years of college but no degree (92.58%), c) a bachelor's degree (80.21%), d) a master's degree (68.62%), e) non-completion of high school (67.93%), f) a high school diploma or equivalent (62.34%), g) an associate's degree (61.58%), h) a doctoral degree or equivalent (60.02%), and i) vocational or technical training (57.47%). The group with the lowest percentage of non-completion was among students who did not know the highest education level of their mother (54.08%). Outcomes by high school enrollment type and mathematics completion. The percentage distributions for the weighted sample of attendants and their outcomes according to the variables of high school type attended and highest level of high school mathematics are provided in Table 6.  The bachelor's degree (65.63%) was the most common degree goal among all attendees, followed by an associate's degree (28.99%), a certificate (3.42%), or no degree (1.96%). However, the degree goal with the most completers, proportional to attendees, was an associate's degree (43.84%), followed by the certificate (27.01%), a bachelor's degree (25.46%), and no degree (22.03%). Close to 60% of students noted they always attended the program on a full-time basis, 3.19% always attended part-time, and 37.57% attended on a mixed (full-time and part-time) basis. Students that attended on a full-time basis also experienced the highest percentage of completion (41.32%), followed by mixed attendees (16.70%). None of the students (0.00%) that attended on an always part-time basis completed the degree program. Conversely, there was a higher percentage of completers of the associate's degree program (39.03%) among the 16.47% attendees that did need remedial coursework. As shown in Table 7, attendees that received grants and loans during the [2003][2004] academic year represented 27.86% of the total population of attendees in the associate's degree program in engineering and engineering technologies. The remaining proportion of students received aid packages consisting of: a) no aid (24.32%), b) grants only (22.48%), c) grants, loans, and other (8.53%), d) loans only (5.12%), e) loans and other (2.90%), f) grants, loans, and work-study (2.47%), g) grants and other (1.71%), h) grants and work-study (1.48%), i) grants, loans, work-study, and other (1.04%), j) work-study and other (0.80%), k) other (0.74%), and l) work-study only (0.55%). Of those attendees, those receiving work-study and other aid packages reported the highest percentage of completion (100%). On the other hand, attendees that received work-study only and those with grants, loans, work-study, and other aid packages reported the highest percentages of non-completion. Attendees that received loans and other also demonstrated higher percentages of completion (68.95%) than did those with: a) other only (62.48%), b) grants, loans, and other (48.95%), c) grants and loans (33.73%), d) loans only (31.17%), e) no aid (28,92%), f) grants and work-study (20.71%), g) grants only (19.40%), h) grants, loans, and work-study (16.14%), and i) grants and other (10.80%). Characteristics of community college completers and non-completers. In describing the weighted sample of attendees in associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies at community colleges, a majority were male (89.40%) with females in the minority at 10.60%. Not only did males attend at a higher rate than did females, they also experienced higher completion rates compared to females (23.89% versus 14.87%). In other words, there were proportionally more female non-completers (85.13%) than there were male non-completers (76.21%). The percentage distributions for the weighted sample of community college engineering and engineering technologies attendants and their outcomes according to the demographic variables of gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, income group 2003-04, and job while enrolled 2004 are listed in Table 8. As detailed in Table 8, the racial/ethnic group with the largest percentage of attendees in associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies at community colleges was White (57.11%) followed by Hispanics or Latinos (17.42%), Black or African Americans (14.32%), Asians (5.91%), those of more than one race (4.01%), other (0.93%), and American Indian or Alaskan Native (.30%) attendees. There were no attendees in the Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander racial/ethnic group.  attained the degree, while none of the attendees (0.00%) with the separated marital status did so. As evidenced in Also noted in Table 8, Table 9 below. Attendees of associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies at community college whose father's highest level of education was a high school diploma or equivalent made up the largest proportion of attendees (32.42%). Comparatively, students whose fathers did not complete high school represented the second highest proportion of attendees (17.66%), followed by fathers with: a) vocational or technical training (10.43%), b) a bachelor's degree (9.12%), c) a master's degree (6.29%), d) an associate's degree (5.02%), e) less than two years of college (4.40%), f) two or more years of college but no degree (3.01%), and g) a first-professional degree (0.46%). It is of note that 11.18% of attendees did not know their father's education level and there were no attendees (0.00%) whose father received a doctoral degree or equivalent. Among attendees whose fathers were associate's degree completers, approximately 56.93% also completed the associate's degree in engineering and engineering technologies at a community college. The group with the second highest proportion of completers were attendees whose father's completed vocational or technical training (50.41%), followed by: a) a high school diploma or equivalent (33.08%), b) a bachelor's degree (17.05%), c) a master's degree (11.63%), (d) unknown education level (6.75%), and (e) did not complete high school (5.57%). There were no reported completers (0.00%) from the population of attendees whose father's highest education level was less than two years of college, two or more years of college but no degree, a first-professional degree, or a doctoral degree or equivalent. The population of attendees whose father's highest education level was less than two years of college, two or more years of college but no degree, a first-professional degree, and a doctoral degree or equivalent reported the highest rates of non-completion (100.00%) in the associate's degree program in engineering and engineering technologies programs at community colleges, closely followed by 94.43% of attendees with fathers that did not complete high school and 93.25% of attendees that did not know their father's education level. Among attendees whose fathers completed a Bachelor's degree, approximately 88.37% were non-completers. Following these, the proportion of non-completing attendees whose fathers earned a high school diploma or equivalent (66.92%), had vocational or technical training (49.59%), or gained an associate's degree (43.07%) comprised the balance of the data. Similarly noted in Table 9, students with mothers whose highest level of education was a high school diploma or equivalent made up the largest percentage of attendees (41.21%) in associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies at community colleges with reported six-year retention and attainment rates. Comparatively, students whose mothers did not complete high school represented the second highest percentage of attendees (12.41%). Other attendees broken down by their mother's level of education included mothers with: a) an associate's degree (9.27%), b) a bachelor's degree (7.98%), c) a master's degree (7.86%), d) less than two years of college (6.22%), e) two or more years of college but no degree (5.62%), and f) vocational or technical training (4.40%). Approximately 5.31% of attendees did not know their mother's education level. No (0.00%) attendees reported their mother's highest education level as a first-professional degree or doctoral degree or equivalent. The group of attendees that experienced the highest rate of completion consisted of those with mothers that possessed a master's degree as their highest education level (55.82%). The group with the second highest proportion of completers were attendees with mothers with a high school diploma (31.66%), followed closely by: a) mothers with an associate's degree (30.08%), b) those who did not know their mother's education level (14.21%), and those whose mothers had c) less than two years of college (10.66%), d) two or more years of college but no degree (5.28%), e) those who did not complete high school (4.70%), and f) mothers with a bachelor's degree (4.29%). There were no reported completers (0.00%) from the population of attendees whose mother's highest education level was vocational or technical training. The population of attendees with mothers whose highest education level was vocational or technical training reported the highest rates of non-completion (100.00%) among those in the associate's degree program in engineering and engineering technologies at community colleges. The proportions of attendees with mothers with the following highest levels of education followed and included those: a) with a bachelor's degree (95.71%), b) who did not complete high school (95.30%), c) with two or more years of college but no degree (94.72%), d) with less than two years of college (89.34%), e) whose mother's education level was unknown (85.79%), f) with an associate's degree (69.92%), g) with a high school diploma or equivalent (68.34%), and g) with a master's degree (44.18%). Outcomes by high school enrollment type and mathematics completion. The percentage distributions for the weighted sample of attendants and their outcomes according to the variables high school type attended and highest level of high school mathematics are listed in Table 10. As also noted in Table 10   was the most common degree goal among all attendees, followed by an associate's degree (40.80%), a certificate (5.09%), and no degree (1.03%). Logically, the degree goals with the greatest number of completers, proportional to attendees, were those pursuing an associate's (33.68%) or bachelor's degree (17.13%). There were no completers (0.00%) reported for attendees desiring a certificate and for those with no degree goal. Instead, all attendees (100%) with the certificate and no degree as their degree goal became non-completers. On the other hand, approximately 66.32% of attendees from the associate's degree and 82.87% of attendees from the bachelor's degree categories were noncompleters. The results for attendance intensity in Table 11 offered  As noted in Table 11, the majority of attendees (76.78%) in associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies at community colleges with reported six-year retention and attainment rates did not need remedial coursework or were not in their 1st/2nd year of college. Of the attendees in this category, there were fewer completers (24.94%) than there were non-completers (75.06%). Among the total population of attendees, approximately 23.22% participated in remedial coursework, of which 15.94% completed the degree and 84.06% did not. As shown in Table 11, attendees with no aid received during the 2003-2004 academic year made up 48.63% of the population of attendees in the associate's degree program in engineering and engineering technologies at community colleges. The remaining proportion of students received aid packages consisting of: a) grants only (30.85%), b) grants and loans (8.25%), c) grants and work-study (2.52%), d) work-study and other (2.42%), e) loans only (2.02%), f) other only (1.95%), g) work-study only (1.62%), h) grants, loans, and work-study (0.76%), i) grants and other (0.52%), and j) grants, loans, and other (0.46%). Of those, attendees that received grants and other or work-study and other aid packages reported 100% completion rates, while those that received work-study only or grants, loans, and other aid packages reported 100% non-completion rates. Attendees that received grants, loans, and work-study also showed higher percentages of completion (59.69%) than the following: a) other only (44.56%), b) grants and loans (29.90%), c) grants and work-study (23.55%), d) no aid (21.87%), e) loans only (15.86%), and f) grants only (14.80%). characteristics of the reference group was a White male student whose first institution was not a public two-year college, who earned a cumulative GPA of Mostly A's (3.75 and above), had a certificate as a degree goal, attended school full-time, did not take remedial coursework in 2004, was low-income, received only grants as financial aid, did not have a high school diploma or certificate, did not know his or her parents' education level, was unemployed, and attended a community college in the New England region (i.e., Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont)."}, {"section_title": "Variables Impacting Associate's Degree Completion at Community Colleges", "text": "PowerStats generated results in the form of Estimated Full Sample Regression Coefficients, Hypothesis Testing Results, Odds Ratio Results, and Measures of Fit tables. Table   12 details the impact of the significant variables from the logistic regression. A positive standard beta value suggests an increase and a negative value suggests a decrease in the probability or chance of completion compared to the reference group. The standardized beta weights in Table 12 indicated that financial aid packages consisting of grants and loans demonstrated the strongest relationship with the dependent variable, followed by an associate's degree as the degree goal in the first year, and completion of calculus as the highest level of high school mathematics. The estimated full sample regression coefficients are in Appendix F for the model and regression coefficients reveal t-statistics as opposed to z-statistics. An examination of the Wald statistics in Table 13 below indicated variables that significantly predict three-year community college retention and completion.  As seen in Table 13,  Using the odds ratio results below in Table 14, it was possible to identify the variables that were statistically significant to the model or had a significant relationship to three-year community college retention and completion. Variables from Table 14 that    Looking closer at the results for race/ethnicity for the Hispanic or Latino variable, t = 2.29 and p< .05, which was therefore statistically significant to the model. With an odds ratio of 1.34, and a coefficient for dependency of 0.03, and holding all other variables constant, statistics revealed that Hispanic or Latino students were 1.34 times more likely to earn an associate's degree at a community college three years after first enrolling than were other ethnicities. All other categories in race/ethnicity (i.e., Black or African American, Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander, other, and more than one race), however, were statistically nonsignificant (p= .05). GPA for 2003-2004 as well as cumulative GPAs of mostly A's and B's and mostly D's and below were statistically non-significant (p= .05). Cumulative GPA variables of Mostly B's (2.75-3.24) and C's and D's (1.25-1.74) were significant (p< .05), Mostly C's (1.75-2.24) was significant (p< .01), and B's and C's (2.25-2.74) were significant (p< .001). Attendees with a cumulative GPA of mostly B's (2.75-3.24) were 0.73 times, B's and C's (2.25-2.74) were 0.70 times, mostly C's (1.75-2.24) were 0.56, and C's and D's (1.25-1.74) were 0.56 times less likely to earn an associate's degree at a community college three years after first enrolling when controlling for the other variables. Similarly, all types of degree goals, attendance intensity patterns, work intensity patterns, and remedial courses taken in 2004 were inversely statistically significant (p< .001). Attendees whose degree goal was to earn an associate's degree were 0.16 times less likely to earn the associate's degree at a community college after three years when holding all other variables constant. Attendees whose degree goal was to earn a bachelor's degree were 0.38 times and students not pursuing a degree were 0.36 times less likely to earn an associate's degree. Inverting the odds ratios of attendance intensity variables, students that always attended full-time were 0.20 more likely than always part-time students and 0.42 times more likely than mixed students to earn an associate's degree at a community college three years after matriculation. Inverting the odds ratios for work intensities, attendees that did not have a job in the 2003-2004 academic year were 0.54 more likely to earn an associate's degree at a community college within three years of first enrolling than were those with part-time jobs and 0.56 times more likely than students with full-time jobs. Last, attendees that did not take a remedial course during the 2003-2004 academic year were 0.49 times likely to earn an associate's degree than were students that did take any type of remedial course. On the other hand, all types of high school mathematics showed positive statistical significance (p< .001). The results from the regression suggested that the higher the mathematics course completed, the more likely the attendee would attain an associate's degree at a community college three years after first enrolling. Specifically, attendees whose highest high school mathematics level was algebra were 1.60, trigonometry/algebra II were 2.48, pre-calculus were 3.75, or calculus were 6.47 more likely to attain an associate's degree. In addition, students that graduated from a private high school were 1.71 more likely to attain an associate's degree than were attendees without a high school diploma or certificate. Pertaining to parent's highest level of education in 2003-2004, the statistically significant (p< .001) variables included when the father did not complete high school or earned a bachelor's degree, a master's degree or equivalent, a first-professional degree, or a doctoral degree or equivalent. Specifically, students with fathers that did not complete high school were 1.56 more likely to attain the associate's degree at the community college three-years after first enrolling than were students whose fathers earned an associate's degree. Moreover, students whose fathers earned a bachelor's degree were 1.77 more likely, a masters degree 1.98 more likely, a first professional 3.60 more likely, and a doctoral degree or equivalent 2.08 more likely to attain an associate's degree. Continuing with the statistically significant (p< .001) variables to the model related to income, high income students were 1.78 times more likely to earn an associate's degree than were students identified as low income. Compared to students that received an aid package during the 2003-2004 consisting of only grants, students more likely to attain an associate's degree three years after first enrolling at a community college included those whose aid package consisted of: a) loans only (odds ratio= 3.71), b) grants and loans (odds ratio= 12.12), c) grants and work-study (odds ratio= 1.85), d) loans and other (odds ratio= 15.77), e) grants, loans, and work-study (odds ratio= 16.53), f) grants, loans, and other (odds ratio= 30.93), and (g) grants, loans, work-study, and other (odds ratio= 27.34). The aforementioned financial aid packages were all statistically significant (p< .001). In contrast, attendees that did not receive any of the aid package options in the study were 0.66 less likely to earn the associate's degree (p< .001). If the institution were in the Plains states (i.e., Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota), the attendee was 0.28 times less likely to retain and attain an associate's degree within three years when controlling for other variables than he or she would be if attending a community college in New England (i.e., Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont), (p< .05). Similarly, attendees from the Southwest (Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas) (odds ratio= 0.29, p< .01) and Far West (Alaska, California, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington) (odds ratio= 0.27, p< .01) were less likely to attain an associate's degree in three years from a community college. Measures of fitness for the model are below in Table 15. The negative log-likelihood (Pseudo-R 2 ) -2 log-likelihood of .42 shows that the predictor variables accounted for 41.73% of the variance in the three-year community college retention and completion rates. Further, the full model, including all predictors, produced a -2 log likelihood of -1488380.78 compared to the -2 log likelihood, intercept-only model of -2554294.17. Therefore, the final model indicated an improvement in fit due to the predictor variables when compared to the null model. Moreover, results of hypothesis testing showed the full model with predictor variables to be a better fit than the intercept-only model (p< .001). As suggested in Table 15, Cox and Snell's Pseudo R 2 (.43) and Estrella's Pseudo R 2 (.52) indicated independent variables could explain at least 40% of the variance in the dependent variable. Based on the model summary statistics, the model demonstrated a moderately weak relationship between the predictor variables and the outcome. Moreover, results of hypothesis testing showed the full model with predictor variables to be a better fit than was the interceptonly model (p< .001).  Table 16 details the impact of the significant variables from the logistic regression. A positive standard beta value suggests an increase and a negative value suggests a decrease in the probability or chance of completion compared to the reference group. The standardized beta weights showed that receiving a financial aid package consisting of grants and loans during the 2003-2004 academic year indicated the strongest relationship with the dependent variable, followed by aid package consisting of grants, loans, and other with completion of calculus as the highest level of high school mathematics. The estimated full sample regression coefficients are in Appendix G for the model and regression coefficients are expressed in the form of t-statistics as opposed to z-statistics."}, {"section_title": "Impact of variables on six", "text": "In addition to analyzing the impact of the independent variables on 6-year community college retention and associate's degree attainment, an examination of the Wald statistics in Table 17 below indicated the variables that significantly predicted six-year community college retention and completion.  Based on the results from Table 17,  Using the odds ratio results below in Table 18, it was also possible to identify the statistically significant variables to the model or those with a significant relationship to six-year community college retention and attainment.  Significant variables to the model included: a) age first year enrolled, b) gender (i.e., Specifically, the odds table first suggested that the older a student, the less likely by 0.10 times he or she would retain and attain an associate's degree in the first six years of enrollment (p< .01). The regression results for female attendees consisted of an odds ratio of 1.24, coefficient for dependency of 0.03, and p< .01. When holding all other variables constant, female attendees were 1.24 times more likely than were males to earn an associate's degree at a community college six years after enrolling. Looking more closely at the results for American Indian or Alaskan Natives, the 3.94 odds ratio suggested that the odds of six-year retention and associate's degree attainment at community colleges for that group were 3.94 times the odds As was the case with the results from the regression of three-year retention and attainment at community colleges, the results of the six-year retention and attainment suggested all types of degree goals, attendance intensity patterns, work intensity patterns, and any remedial course taken in 2004 were inversely statistically significant (p< .001). Attendees whose degree goal was to earn an associate's degree were 0.17 times less likely to retain or earn an associate's degree at a community college in six years when holding all other variables constant. Attendees whose degree goal was to earn a bachelor's degree were 0.32 times and students not pursuing a degree were 0.33 times less likely to earn an associate's degree. Inverting the odds ratios of attendance intensity variables, students that always attended full-time were 0.14 more likely than always part-time students and 0.39 times more likely than mixed students to earn an associate's degree at a community college six years after first starting. Inverting the odds ratios for work intensities, attendees that did not have a job in the 2003-2004 academic year were 0.44 more likely than those with part-time jobs and 0.37 times more likely than students with full-time jobs were to earn an associate's degree at a community college six years from first enrolling. Last, the odds ratio of 0.50 suggested that the odds of retention and attainment of an associate's degree six years after enrolling for students that took a remedial course during the 2003-2004 academic year were 0.4975 times less than the odds for attendees that did not take remedial coursework. On the other hand, all types of high school mathematics showed positive statistical significance (p< .001). The results from the regression suggested that the higher the mathematics course completed, the more likely the attendee would retain and attain an associate's degree at a community college six years after enrolling. Specifically, attendees whose highest high school mathematics level was algebra (odds ratio= 1.69), trigonometry/algebra II (odds ratio= 2.58), pre-calculus (odds ratio= 3.70), or calculus (odds ratio= 6.06) were more likely to attain the associate's degree at the community college within six years. In addition, the odds ratio of 1.54 suggested that the odds for college attendees graduating from a private high school to retain and attain an associate's degree from a community college six years after first enrolling were 1.54 times the odds of attendees who did not posses a high school diploma or certificate. Pertaining to parents' highest level of education in 2003-2004, the statistically significant variables included the father not possessing a high school diploma or certificate or attaining a bachelor's degree, a master's degree or equivalent, or a first-professional degree. To be exact, students whose fathers that did not complete high school were 1.50 more likely to attain the associate's degree at the community college six years after enrolling than were students whose fathers earned an associate's degree (p< .05). Moreover, students whose fathers earned a bachelor's degree were 1.59 and masters degree were 1.65 likelier to attain an associate's degree. These variables were statistically significant (p< .01). Lastly, student's whose father's earned a first professional degree were 2.87 times likelier to attain the associate's degree (p< .001). Continuing with the statistically significant variables to the model as involving income group, high middle income students were 1.31 times more likely (p< .05) and high income students 1.93 times more likely (p< .001) to earn the associate's degree than were low income students. Compared to students that received an aid package during the 2003- 2004  Related to six-year community college retention and attainment, the intercept for the model suggested the log-odds of completion for attendees was 70.38. The model summary produced F (78,123) = 26.16, p< .05, and explained 44.12% of the variance in the average sixyear community college retention and completion rates.

Using the odds ratio results in Table 21 below, it was also possible to identify the variables statistically significant to the model. Under the testable conditions using a reduced number of regressors, significant variables to the model included female and enrollment size 2003-04. The researcher also analyzed standardized beta weights (Appendix H) to identify the contribution of each significant variable in predicting the dependent variable. The regression results for female attendees consisted of an odds ratio of 21.80 and a coefficient for dependency of 0.09. This indicated that female attendees were more likely than were males to earn an associate's degree in engineering and engineering technologies (odds ratio= 21.80, p< .001). Comparable descriptive statistics from Table 4 seem to support the logistic regression findings. While it can be concluded from the descriptive statistics in Table 4 that proportionally males and females completed the programs at similar rates (28.41% and 30.00%), females still demonstrated higher rates of completion by 1.59%. The odds table also suggested that, as an institution's enrollment size increases, attendees in engineering and engineering technologies associate degree programs will become completers by 1.00 times (p< .01).

There was one category with attendees that completed the program in close approximation, proportionally: gender. A majority of attendants of associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies were male (90%) with females in the minority at 10%. However, while more males attended the program than did females, completion rates appeared to be comparable (28.41% of males and 30.00% of females). It will be shown in subsequent methods of the study that the 1.59% higher completion rate by females supports the finding of gender as a predictor of associate's degree completion in engineering and engineering technologies. Between the 2003-2004 and 2008-2009 academic years, approximately 28% of community college students in associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies earned the degree. Some of the predominant characteristics of completers in engineering and engineering technologies from community colleges were different from the first examination of attendees from all institutions. Specifically, higher percentages of completion were found among students that were: Males, American Indian or Alaskan Natives, single, divorced, or widowed, middle income, worked part-time, always enrolled full-time, did not take remedial coursework, started college with the goal of an associate's degree, had a father that holds an associate's degree and mother that holds a master's degree, attended a public high school, and completed Trigonometry/Algebra II. A majority of attendees of engineering and engineering technologies programs at community college were male (89.40%) with females in the minority at 10.60%. Not only did males enroll at a higher rate than did females, they also experienced higher completion rates compared to females. In other words, there were proportionally more female non-completers than there were male non-completers. Although Whites comprised 57.11% and American Indians or Alaskan Natives comprised 0.30% of all attendees, American Indians or Alaskan Natives experienced the highest rate of completion (100%), followed by White (32.32%), Black or African American (14.36%), Asian (11.21%), and Hispanic or Latino (7.87%) completers. None of the attendees that identified as more than one race and from the \"Other\" racial/ethnic category earned the degree. Moreover, there were no students of Native Hawaiian/Pacific Island background that enrolled in an associate's degree program in engineering and engineering technologies program at a community college. Concerning non-completers of associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies at community colleges, data showed that higher proportions of noncompleters tended to be female, separated from their spouse, either mixed or of another race/ethnicity not listed in the survey, and low income. Furthermore, nearly all of the students Based on the findings, one could predict a higher probability of completion three years after enrolling at the community college if the student were: Hispanic or Latino with a financial aid package (excluding work-study or another unspecified source) or from a high income background. This student also graduated from a private high school, took an Algebra 2 mathematics course or higher in high school, and, had a father who completed at least two years of college or earned a bachelor's degree or higher. Conversely, the results also suggested the significant negative impact of the following factors on three-year community college retention and completion: a) lower cumulative GPA, b) degree goals, c) part-time attendance, d) remedial coursework taken, e) no financial aid award f) job while enrolled, and g) attending a college located in the Great Lakes, Plains, Southwest, Rocky Mountains, Far West (United States), or another jurisdiction (Puerto Rico)."}, {"section_title": "Six-year community college retention and attainment of associate's degrees.

Age, gender, and enrollment size 2003-04 were also found significant for six-year community college retention and attainment, but race/ethnicity did not significantly impact completion. The standardized beta weights indicated that receiving a financial aid package consisting of grants and loans during the 2003-2004 academic year exerted the strongest, positive impact on six-year community college retention and completion rates. This was consistent with the previous regression of three-year community college retention and attainment rates. .8 times greater than a male completing. Moreover, the odds of completion were 1.0 times higher at institutions with higher enrollment. However, the statistical model of prediction exhibited a very weak relationship between the student-related and institutional variables and the outcome of associate's degree completion in engineering and engineering technologies, which suggested the impact of extraneous variables. Another related limitation of the study was the small weighted sample size from which the results were generated. Therefore, the results of the study were inconclusive in terms of the extent to which the findings can be generalized to predicting completion in associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies."}, {"section_title": "Discussion of the Findings", "text": "Completion of associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies. Hagedorn and Purnamasari (2012) argued that, to address nuances in STEMoccupational shortages, researchers needed to decouple student background data on STEM courses and programs. In other words, in order to address challenges in the engineering profession, research should start by examining only engineering students. However, few studies focused on students pursuing an associate's degree in engineering and engineering technologies even though the associate's degree programs are a crucial source of talent for a STEM-capable workforce. Therefore, this study fills a gap of what is known about engineering and engineering technician students. The demographic makeup of engineering and engineering technologies sub-baccalaureate degree-seeking students in this study mirrored the results of studies of baccalaureate and other graduate engineering students (Buck, Clark, Leslie-Pelecky, Lu, & Cerda-Lizarraga, 2008;Lichtenstein, McCormick, Sheppard, Puma, 2010;Riegle-Crumb & King, 2010;Seymour & Hewitt, 1997). That is, attendees and completers of associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies were predominately White, male, and from a high-income group. The demographic makeup of non-completers of associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies also reflected the results from prior studies of non-completing engineering students pursuing a four-year or advanced degree. Specifically, there was an overrepresentation of non-completers who were legally married, members of a racial/ethnic minority group, and of lower income status (Buck et al., 2008;Lichtenstein et al., 2010;Riegle-Crumb & King, 2010;Seymour & Hewitt, 1997). The current study revealed that, proportionally, males and females completed associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies at similar rates as was in previous studies, and supported other research demonstrating no difference between males and females persisting with or departing from STEM higher education programs (Cosentino de Cohen & Deterding, 2009;Leslie, McClure, & Oaxaca, 1998;Liu & Liu, 1999;Sewell & Shah, 1967). Added to that, the current study contributes to the overall growing body of evidence of the under-representation of female students entering postsecondary engineering education in the U.S. (Lichtenstein et al., 2010;Lord et al., 2009;Cosentino de Cohen & Deterding, 2009). More notably, the research presents proof of gender disparities at the associate's degree-level that were previously undocumented in the scholarly literature. In particular, two distinct, yet equally important, underlying issues can be extracted from these data: low attendance by females, and low numbers of male completers relative to total male attendees. Matriculation by females versus males in associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies at all institutions and community colleges was 1:10. This was unfortunate in light of the background information by Wentling and Camacho (2008) that revealed only 10% of high school females expressed disinterest in engineering. Lord, Camacho, Layton, Long, Ohland, and Wasburn (2009) emphasized a similar observation, as women make up 58% of all undergraduates, they represent the greatest potential source of engineers. The second issue related to declining interest in a sub-baccalaureate degree in engineering and engineering technologies was evident in the low completion rates by males. Upon closer examination of within-group behaviors, what stands out in the case of male attendees is the low proportion of completers, relative to their higher level of attendance. Carnevale et al. (2011) explained that the low percentages of completion in engineering and engineering technologies relative to matriculation rates could be due to potentially STEMtalented students being diverted to non-STEM educational and career pathways. This divergent gap in the headcount between matriculating and completing sub-baccalaureate students in engineering and engineering technologies was evident in students taking an alternative pathway to an outcome, both of which were not the foci in the present study. One possible explanation from the current data was that males and females alike committed or re-committed to a field or degree goal (i.e., certificate, bachelor's, no degree), which did not include obtaining an associate's degree conferral in engineering and engineering technologies along the way. This finding was consistent with a conclusion by Lichtenstein, Loshbaugh, Claar, Chen, Jackson, and Sheppard (2009) that studied the persistence of students in four-year engineering program. The researchers found that some students did not plan to pursue a career in engineering at the beginning or the end of their undergraduate engineering studies. While the current study did not observe non-completers or interview them about their reasons for non-completion, one explanation could be their choice to study a different subject. However, this contrasted Lord et al. (2009) who found that, during the first two years of college, women were more likely than were men to change their major from engineering to another. Reasons for non-completion in other studies of four-year engineering programs that might warrant further comparison at the two-year level include lack of interest, an overwhelming curriculum, and larger numbers of Physical Science majors (Astin, 1993;Licthenstein et al., 2010;Seymour & Hewitt, 1994). Females, racial or ethnic minorities, and lower income students were over-represented in census data of community college campuses in the study by Shapiro, Dundar, Ziskin, Chiang, Chen, Harrell, and Torres (2013). In the current study, however, community college students enrolled in associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies were mainly White, male, and from middle and high income backgrounds. Similar to the case of female attendance, the lower matriculation of underrepresented racial/ethnic minorities could reflect low interest in or exposure to a two-year degree in engineering and engineering technologies or employment that required specific credentials despite the high demand by employers. Lower attendance and completion by Blacks or African Americans, Hispanics or Latinos, Asians, American Indians or Alaskan Natives, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islanders, and students of mixed or other backgrounds were consistent with prior research by Bailey et al. (2004), Bonous-Hammarth (2000), and Lichtenstein et al. (2010) Bailey et al. (2009) andthe NCES (2003) also documented the increasing trend of underprepared students enrolling at two-and four-year colleges and universities; however, the current findings indicated that most attendees of engineering and engineering technologies programs did not need remedial education when entering a two-year public college. Whereas, Liu and Liu (1999) observed higher completion rates at community colleges for older adults, the findings from this study lent more support towards the research by Kolajo (2004) whose results indicated higher completion rates for younger adults. Variables impacting associate's degree completion at community colleges. The current study found that the BPS: 04/09 dataset and the reporting mechanism PowerStats were robust tools to generate results consistent with previous studies of completion at community colleges. For example, data from the examination of six-year community college completers coincided with related research that concluded younger students were more likely to graduate Liu & Liu, 1999;Nakajima, Dembo, & Mossler, 2012;Settle, 2010). Also consistent with the majority of studies on community college completion, students with higher first-year GPAs and higher cumulative GPAs (i.e., 3.75 or higher) were more likely to earn an associate's degree in three or six years after beginning their college careers (Craig & Ward, 2008;Jaeger & Eagan, 2009;Makuakane-Dreschel & Hagedorn, 2000;Nakajima et al., 2012). Like Jaeger and Eagan (2009) and Nakajima et al. (2012), the researcher in this study was unable to filter completions by academic program. Gender was a poor predictor of three-year community college retention and completion rates in this study. This was in line with the findings of Ko (2005) who did not observe any gender differences in three-year completion rates. On the other hand, this study as well as research by Jaeger and Eagan (2009) and Shapiro (2013) of six-year completion rates found gender a significant predictor with females more likely to graduate at higher rates. The present and related studies concluded that graduation rates varied by ethnic background and length of time to graduation (Bailey et al., 2004;Cabrera, Terenzini, & Pascarella, 1999;D'Amico et al., 2011;Jaeger & Eagan, 2009;Ko, 2005). In the current study, Hispanics or Latinos were more likely to complete the associate's degree in three years and American Indians or Alaskan Natives were more likely to complete the associate's degree in six years. Also, Borden (2002) observed that the largest increase in associate's degrees conferred at 2-year institutions between the 1992-1993 and 2000-2001 academic years was among Hispanics and Latinos. Findings from this study supported that trend. Cejda and Rhodes (2004) interviewed faculty from technical and occupational programs at a Hispanic-serving community college who were experienced with facilitating student success. Key factors the faculty cited to influencing past student progress and completion was mentoring programs and other academic support services (e.g., The Puente Project), relationships with faculty, and financial aid (Cejda & Rhodes, 2004). Faculty served as mentors and emphasized increased employability and income as benefits completion (Cejda & Rhodes, 2004). Barriers to completion included lack of transferability of credits and access to a bachelor's degree program (Cejda & Rhodes, 2004). While there may be some areas of agreement, the findings from this study on the outcomes according to racial/ethnic groups also contradict previous studies that showed lower graduation rates among ethnic minorities (Bailey et al., 2004;Chang, Sharkness, Hurtado, & Newman, 2014;Nora et al., 1996). Students in the study who always enrolled on a part-time basis or enrolled on a mixed (part-time and full-time) basis during their studies and were employed (either full-time or parttime) were less likely to complete the associate's degree within three or six years from beginning college. These data aligned with Nora et al. (1996) and Habley and McClanahan (2004) on the negative impact of working and other demands that restricted the students' persistence to degree completion. This study was largely consistent with the results of research conducted by D'Amico et al. (2011) with regard to the impact of remedial education in which students that did not need to complete developmental education were more likely to attain an associate's degree within three and six years after beginning postsecondary education at a community college. Related to this finding, students that completed Algebra 2 or higher in high school were also more likely to earn an associate's degree. Preparation for college-level math and other factors, such as higher secondary school performance, fewer financial burdens or barriers, and quicker time-to-degreecompletion, than other community college entrants placed in remedial education might be reasons for higher completion rates (Astin, 1999;Elkins, 2000;Bailey et al., 2009;D'Amico et al., 2011;Feldman, 1993;Goble, Rosenbaum, & Stephan, 2008;Habley & McClanahan, 2004;McDaniel & Graham, 2001;Napoli & Wortman, 1998;Perrakis, 2008;Porchea et al., 2010;Tinto, 1975). Data from this study agreed with findings of earlier research denoting financial aid as one of the predictors of community college completion (Bailey et al., 2004, Cofer & Somers, 2001Makuakane-Dreschel et al., 2000). However, specific combinations of aid moderated completion of associate's degrees. In other words, not all aid packages significantly predict completion. Moreover, not receiving aid or insufficient levels of aid could inhibit associate's degree of completion at community colleges. Aid packages that included grants and loans were positive predictors of completion in this study while not receiving any aid was a negative predictor. The positive impact of loans confirmed the findings by Cofer and Somers (2001), but those researchers delimited their findings to students receiving federally unsubsidized loans. As with the working definition of grants in this study, the term loans included federal and non-federal and subsidized and unsubsidized loans. In this study, if a student received only loans, he or she was more likely to be a three-year or six-year community college completer. This attribution could be due to the greater availability of loans and funding amounts (Cofer & Somers, 2001). Other than students that received loans-only during their first year of enrollment, completers were more likely to earn the associate's degree if they received more than one form of financial aid. It is concerning that community college students that did not receive financial aid in their first year of enrollment were less likely to earn an associate's degree. This is in line with studies of the negative impact of not filing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or late-filing on student persistence at community colleges McKinney & Novak, 2012). In order to receive federal and state financial aid, students must complete the FAFSA. What is also concerning is that aid-eligible students, such as low income students that would qualify and have greater chances of receiving need-based financial aid like the Pell Grant, file the FAFSA at lower rates (Radey & Cheatham, 2013). In the NPSAS: 12, reasons why undergraduates did not apply for financial aid included the belief that they do not need financial aid and can afford it, consider themselves ineligible, do not want to incur debt, lack information related to applying, and thought application forms were too complicated (Ifill, 2016). Only father's, not mother's, highest level of education was a significant predictor of community college completion. Students with fathers who obtained a bachelor's degree or higher were more likely to complete their associate's degree three and six years after enrolling at a community college. This replicated earlier findings by Alfonso (2006) using BPS: 89/04 that showed parental education to predict six-year associate's degree completion. Also noteworthy, students whose fathers did not complete high school were just as likely to graduate with an associate's degree as were those whose fathers enrolled in college. This could be due in part, to the students' inspiration to pursue higher education and awareness of the added benefits of the degree. Results indicated that students attending a community college in the Rocky Mountains (i.e., Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming), Puerto Rico, and Washington, D.C. regions were more likely to earn an associate's degree than students in the New England region (i.e., Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont). This is on trend with earlier analyses of associate's degree completion according to region by Borden (2002). Borden (2002) observed decreases in associate's degree conferrals at colleges located in New England and the Great Plains between the 1992-1993 and 2000-2001 academic years. The region experiencing the largest increase in associate's degree conferrals and surpassing historically-dominant New England was the Rocky Mountains (Borden, 2002). Borden (2002) attributed the growth in associate's degrees in the Rocky Mountain region to booming metropolitan areas within the region and adjacent such as Denver and Las Vegas. Labor productivity in the Great Lakes region (i.e., Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin), on the other hand, slowed particularly in the Chicago Tri-State area (i.e., Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin) due to the declining demand of workers in the manufacturing industry and 1% growth in service sectors (OECD, 2012). The moderate relationship found between the predictor variables and three-year and sixyear community college retention and completion means there is still opportunity for improving the accuracy of the predictive model. Accomplishing this may necessitate increasing the sample size and adding other observable factors to produce more insightful conclusions on associate's degree completion in community colleges."}, {"section_title": "Predicting associate's degree completion in engineering and engineering", "text": "technologies. While the predictors for associate's degree completion at community colleges were many, few predictors existed for associate's degree completion in engineering and engineering technologies in this study. Only two variables were significant: female gender and enrollment size 2003-04. Female attendees were more likely than were males to earn an associate's degree in engineering and engineering technologies. This finding was consistent with the prior examination of six-year community college retention and completion as well as findings at the baccalaureate degree level where completion rates were higher for females than they were for males . This finding raises the subsequent question as to the reasons for this phenomenon. In related studies, female completers in STEM programs attributed their outcome to the positive influence of mentors in education and from the profession or the culture of their program, while others pointed to a greater ratio of female instructors and participation in special programs (Brawner, Camacho, Lord, Long, & Ohland, 2012;Chang et al., 2014;Dickerson, 2015;Eris, Chachra, Chen, Sheppard, Ludlow, Rosca, Bailey, & Toye, 2010;Harris, Rhoads, Walden, Murphy, Meissler, & Reynolds, 2004;Leslie et al., 1998;Lichtenstein, 2010;Starobin & Laanan, 2008;Strawn & Livelybrooks, 2012;Zeldin, & Pajares, 2000). Other case studies document the efficacy of state-based or campus-based initiatives to strengthen the pathway from secondary school to college-level engineering programs as well as articulation policies available between associate's and bachelor's degree programs (Huziak-Clark, Sondergeld, Staaden, Knaggs, & Bullerjahn, 2015;Lyon, Jafri, & St. Louis, 2012;Starobin & Laanan, 2008;Strawn & Livelybrooks, 2012). Results from the present study suggested that, as an institution's enrollment size increased, students in engineering and engineering associate's degree programs were more likely become completers. This finding is consistent with a recent study by Yaghmaee (2014) who concluded that large and very large institutions experienced higher completion rates than did small and mid-sized institutions. Alfonso (2006), Bailey et al. (2004), and , on the other hand, concluded that larger enrollments and community college completion negatively associated. Unlike the aforementioned studies, however, Miller (2013) delineated differences in completion rates based on academic program size. Miller found that chemical engineering doctoral programs with a larger first-year student cohort and overall student and faculty populations experienced significantly higher graduation rates than did smaller programs. Based on Yaghmaee (2014) and Miller (2013), it is plausible that students in this study attended larger colleges that are more urbanized, which then presents the possibility of greater availability of resources (e.g., instructional expenditures and student services) that can be applied toward recruitment, retention, and completion of engineering and engineering technologies programs. On the other hand, Romano and Palmer (2016), Hillman and Orians (2013), and Betts and McFarland (1995) found when reviewing enrollment trends, enrollment size fluctuations coincided with economic upswings and downturns and were more obvious at community colleges. Specifically, when there was an economic recession and high unemployment, colleges experienced surges in enrollment. Conversely, as the economy recovered, enrollment sizes decreased. In 2003, the U.S experienced economic growth while enrollments at colleges contracted. Then, from 2007-2009 the U.S. fell into an economic recession in which enrollments increased. Given that these business cycles simultaneously occurring during the course of the BPS: 04/09 study, it is possible that the growth in enrollment size since 2003-2004 also positively impacted completion. This study also confirmed that a majority of the factors of associate's degree completion at community colleges were inapplicable to students pursuing an associate's degree in the field of engineering and engineering technologies. Again, the descriptive statistics of engineering and engineering technologies students resembled the participation of students in all of higher education engineering. As such, the significant predictors of completion of associate's degrees at community colleges were not found the same for associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies. Effectively, the regression model with the two significant variables could only predict 26% of associate's degree completion in engineering and engineering technologies. To increase the model's accuracy, researchers should consider other factors not included in this study, but known to be factors of persistence in bachelor's and postbaccalaureate engineering degrees (e.g., self-efficacy, job or salary outlook) while retaining gender and enrollment size as independent variables. Lastly, it should be reiterated that the few significant variables and their weak relationship to the statistical model in this study may be circumstantial or conditional given the small sample size and limited variables in the BPS: 04/09 survey to characterize institutional factors. Since a major limitation of the study was the small weighted sample size, the results of the study are inconclusive in terms of the extent to which the findings can be generalized to the population of students in associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies. Conversely, a study with a larger sample size and includes previously excluded student-related and institutional covariates and extraneous variables may lead to more generalizeable conclusions on the completion of associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies."}, {"section_title": "Connections to the Conceptual Framework", "text": "The conceptual framework for this study that examined the key student-related and institutional factors of the output of program completion was a modification of Astin's (1991) Input-Environment-Outcome (I-E-O) Model, based on Tinto's (1993) seminal theory of student integration. Tinto described the behaviors of completion and departure as a longitudinal decision-making process influenced by student and institutional characteristics. The I in Astin's I-E-O model consisted of the Inputs or the students' personal attributes upon entering college. The E referred to the Environment, and was synonymous with the External Community from Tinto's theory. This component of the model guided researchers, administrators, and policymakers in identifying and understanding the institutional factors that impacted the Outcome (O), which, in this case, was completion. Astin (1991) and Tinto (1993) agreed that, when studying student retention and outcomes, researchers should focus on the institutional and contextual characteristics, such as student and faculty demographics, academic and social programs, experiences in college, and programmatic characteristics, in addition to the student. In the present examination, the researcher considered institutional characteristics along with student-related characteristics to predict the outcome of completion and non-completion in a specific context, the community college. Illustrated in Figure 2 below are the significant variables found to impact three-and sixyear community college retention and associate's degree attainment. Based on the methodology and within the parameters of PowerStats whereby both student-related and institutional variables were inputted into the logistic regression model at the same level (Level 1), the resulting impactful student-related and institutional variables were placed within a re-casted conceptual framework of completion. Figure 2. Significant student-related and institutional variables impacting three-and six-year community college retention and attainment. During the study, it was discovered that the conceptual framework did not fully explain the impact of student-related and institutional characteristics on the completion of students in engineering and engineering technologies programs at community colleges due to the small weighted sample size. Instead, the researcher used an alternative methodology and broadened the sample to include the weighted sample of awardees of engineering and engineering technologies associate's degrees from all colleges in BPS: 04/09. Illustrated in Figure 3 are the significant student and institutional predictors of associate's degree completion in engineering and engineering technologies from the logistic regression performed in PowerStats. Examination of these characteristics will be referenced in the re-casted conceptual framework for its impact on the outcomes of completion and non-completion. Given the findings from research question 3, the conceptual framework involving a regression model with a small weighted sample, few institutional factors, low predictive ability, and two significant variables (i.e., female gender and college enrollment size) appears to be less than comprehensive in explaining the phenomenon of engineering and engineering technologies associate's degree completion. Still, it could serve as one plausible explanation for a subset of completers. In the study, the greater likelihood of associate's degree completion in engineering and engineering technologies by females may be due to programs aimed at increasing female participation in a historically male-dominated field. Along with the second significant predictor, enrollment size 2003-04, one could conclude that female students enrolled in associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies were more likely to complete the program at larger institutions. This might be plausible at larger institutions with higher proportions of female students and faculty as part of the critical mass, due to economic business cycles, greater availability of resources, or wider education and professional networks-but again, none of these were examined in this study. The results from the alternative methodology further demonstrated the complexity involved in the outcome of completion in associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies. Based on the differences in student and institutional characteristics between Figure 2 and Figure 3, it appeared that a majority of the factors of associate's degree completion at community colleges (e.g., more mathematics courses and family background characteristics) did not apply to students pursuing an associate's degree in the field of engineering and engineering technologies. However, given the small, weighted sample sizes to which the evidence relates, the findings of the impactful and predictive student-related and institutional variables to associate's degree completion in engineering and engineering technologies were inconclusive. The researcher acknowledges that, while the conceptual framework might better suit explaining associate's degree completion at community colleges and a subset of completions in engineering and engineering technologies, future studies should explore the existence of other engineering pathways. Again, the descriptive statistics of associate's degree students in engineering and engineering technologies resembled, more so, the participation of students in all of higher education engineering. Given the common characteristics of students pursuing an associate's, bachelor's, and graduate degree in engineering, one might visualize the phenomena of associate's degree completion in engineering and engineering technologies by a subbaccalaureate education-to-profession typology similar to the four-composite typology or four pathways identified by Cannady, Greenwald, and Harris (2014) of STEM Bachelor's degree holders. Cannady et al. (2014) and Lyon et al. (2012) contended that the popularized STEM pipeline and other overly simplistic, compartmentalized frameworks, suggesting a singular route from A to B, lacked flexibility and obscured the importance of multiple entry and re-entry points into STEM higher education and professions."}, {"section_title": "Limitations of the Study", "text": "Although numerous factors of postsecondary degree completion exist in the literature (e.g., entrance exam scores, social integration, faculty employment ratios, faculty racial/ethnic composition), the focus of this research study was on select student-related and institutional variables and whether those variables applied to predictive models of completion in associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies. By using BPS: 04/09, the researcher delimited the study to post-secondary students who enrolled for the first time in 2003-2004 and earned their first associate's degree in engineering and engineering technologies programs of studies. At the same time, a major limitation of the study was the use of the secondary data source (BPS: 04/09) because its survey methodology, albeit methodically sound, eliminated the population of students returning to higher education and attended community colleges. Furthermore, the BPS: 04/09 dataset was modified through coarsening and weighting. Results from PowerStats were then reported as weighted estimates and not as absolute numbers. Since the absolute sample sizes could not be disclosed per NCES standards and the weighted sample sizes for students in associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies were small, findings from the predictive modeling in PowerStats were inconclusive. The limited, weighted sample size reduced the population validity. Subsequently, practical implications garnered from the analyses of associate's degrees completion in engineering and engineering technologies using the BPS: 04/09 dataset in PowerStats were few and nearly negligible. In addition, the BPS: 04/09 dataset did not include items pertaining to ancillary services and programs, as well as other institutional statistics specific to individual community colleges (e.g., faculty office hours, faculty-student ratios). Therefore, the BPS: 04/09 dataset also excluded possible confounding variables, which consequently required omission as part of the present study's methodology. Considering the study could not measure the impact of the confounding variables, there may be reasons beyond the scope of the selected student-related and institutional variables explored in this study that account for the completion of associate's degrees in engineering and engineering technologies. Likewise, another concern of this study was the inability to control for covariates from the BPS: 04/09 dataset that might account for the completion of associate's degrees in engineering and engineering technologies. Eliminating highly correlated covariates causing multicollinearity in order to solve the regression equations of research questions two and three further limited the exploratory purposes of the study. The impact of the missing covariates on completion in engineering and engineering technologies could not be measured. Along those same lines and in order to predict completion rates, an adequate number of cases must exist. Unfortunately, an insufficient number of cases to predict associate's degree completion in engineering and engineering technologies at community colleges became evident during the course of the investigation. The alternative procedure to conduct measures of inferential statistics by using the weighted sample of attendees of engineering and engineering technologies associate's degree programs from all colleges, instead of only community colleges, did yield results. Notwithstanding the alternative inferential statistical test, descriptive data from student-related variables from engineering and engineering technologies attendees at community colleges were still analytically viable for purposes of satisfying the objectives of this study and responding to the first research question. This research study helps to fill a gap in the literature, adding to the knowledge base on completers of sub-baccalaureate technical degree programs. The empirical findings of this research study focused on student-related and institutional variables in the BPS: 04/09 study compared to related literature as determinants of other successes in postsecondary education. This study serves as a starting point for regional, state, and national researchers of education in the examination of associate's degree completion in engineering and engineering technologies and highlights the need, challenges, and benefits of doing so."}, {"section_title": "Implications for Practice and Future Research", "text": "Since the inception of this type of institution, community and technical colleges have served as one of the key engines for the nation's economy, tapping into the latent skills of countless individuals. Transfer of associate's degree holders to four-year institutions and the subsequent completion of higher degrees is an established, critical pathway to grow and sustain the nation's competitive advantage . communities, the toolkit is also supposed to contain accurate employment data and plans to enhance pedagogy based on student characteristics, address the students' environment, and increase awareness of the college and workplace environments. The AACC recognized that, in order to accomplish the Completion Agenda, there should be a level of transparency with respect to completion, data should be accessible to \"anyone with an interest [and the contents of the toolkit should be] useful for all types of colleges\" (McPhail, 2011, p. 4). This study aligned with the goals of the Completion Agenda and Toolkit by contributing to the body of research on an understudied STEM educational and professional pathway, the associate's degree in engineering and engineering technologies. Implications for schools and colleges. This study supports the need to increase awareness of a viable pathway leading to a career or advanced studies in STEM fields-the associate's degree. Numerous stakeholders, such as educational administrators, faculty, graduates, and current students of the program, can directly contribute to increasing exposure of associate's degree programs in engineering and engineering technologies and strengthening the path to completion. Each type of stakeholder can increase engagement with current and students on multiple fronts. Evidence by Astin (1975) and Tinto (1993) suggested higher degree completion rates by students with higher levels of engagement or integration. Considering the high number of students in this study that entered college with a degree goal yet did not earn the associate's degree in engineering and engineering technologies, educators should review individual programs of studies to assist students in reaching their career and academic goals. Prior studies demonstrated that filing an official degree plan (i.e., an advising tool documenting progress to degree) significantly correlated with graduation rates among CTE students (Gantt, 2010). As an example, in the course Engineering 101 at Highline Community College's and Seattle Central Community College's Northwest Engineering Talent Expansion Partnership, students developed a two-year academic plan that mapped a path to earn an associate's degree and then transfer to a four-year university. Students interviewed in the study by Starobin and Laanan (2008) expressed that creating the document, keeping focused, and seeing their own progress on the academic pathway saved them time and money. College administrators as well as state-and national-level policymakers should create campaigns aimed at the hiring of underrepresented minority instructors. For example, policymakers should create incentives for both colleges and instructors to hire underrepresented groups in engineering and engineering technologies programs. In addition and shown in prior studies of high school, college, and graduate students interested in pursuing STEM degrees and professions, increasing female and racial/ethnic minority faculty representation on campuses encourages levels of social and academic integration complimentary to one's goal commitment; advances diversity, promotes positive images and mentorship, and, increases exposure to the field of engineering, subsequently leading to positive student success outcomes (Brawner et al., 2012;Creamer, Amelink, & Meszaros, 2010;Cole & Espinoza, 2011;Harris et al., 2004;Lawrence & Mancuso, 2012;Ott, 1978;Starobin & Laanan, 2008;Walden & Foor, 2008;Wee, Cordova-Wentling, Korte, Larson, & Loui, 2010;Zeldin & Pajares, 2000). Knowing this, college fairs at high schools should involve underrepresented STEM instructors. Furthermore, underrepresented STEM instructors and students should be part of pre-organized college tours and open houses. These efforts represent opportunities for engagement that can increase the prospective and incoming students' visibility of and exposure to the college curriculum, potential mentors, and STEM professions. In planning for enrollment size changes due to economic cycles and also based on the findings that financial aid positively-and receiving no aid negatively impacts associate's degree completion at community colleges, it would be prudent for states and colleges to maintain a \"high tuition-high aid policy,\" (Romano & Palmer, 2016, p. 53). Colleges should be able to save the revenue from the high tuition policy and draw from it to grant students as opposed to sending the revenue to the state and continuing the reliance on funds, albeit dwindling funds, from the government during economic downturns (Romano & Palmer, 2016). Furthermore, government agencies should reconsider the use of performance-based funding in light of the connection between enrollment and business cycles and given the limitations of the data from reports or databases such as BPS: 04/09 in PowerStats. By reducing the role of performance-based funding formulas and increasing allocations or allowing for the banking of tuition revenue for future granting disbursements, states and colleges will also find that increasing grant aid may allow students to attend their associate's degree program full-time and increases the chances of completion. Students in this study that received financial aid packages consisting of grants, loans, and other combinations thereof, needed to complete the FAFSA. Although it is a free application, the number of attendees that did not receive any aid implies that the barriers to the completion of the FAFSA and other financial aid applications need to be pursued. It is especially pertinent to students that will or currently attend smaller institutions. For example, outreach efforts at public high schools can bring greater awareness, understanding, and application assistance with the FAFSA to males and females of all socioeconomic and racial/ethnic backgrounds. In addition, existing programs targeting special populations, such as females in STEM or Hispanic/Latinos, should consider including early FAFSA completion as a priority. At the college level, it is imperative that the FAFSA-specific services are available and academic-financial planning is part of the regular on-going conversations between students and their college-level and academic program advisors. Part of the academic program advisor's role in overseeing a student's persistence to completion is understanding the student's continued ability to pay. At the same time, it should not be assumed that only low income students can benefit from filing the FAFSA and receiving financial aid. In smaller colleges or engineering and engineering technologies programs with fewer resources, technological resources can be leveraged so that incoming students receive text messages and emails reminding them to file a FAFSA and current students receive text messages and emails to re-file a FAFSA regardless of income level. Response rates to text message reminders about applying for financial aid in a study by Castleman and Page (2014) were found to be substantial and freshman-sophomore persistence rates were higher among students participating in the intervention at 2-year colleges compared to the 2-year college student control group. From a policy perspective, this study echoes the urge for the federal government to simplify the FAFSA application and other agencies to minimize complicated financial aid applications (Castleman & Page, 2014;Radey & Cheatham, 2013). It was seen in the present study that financial aid packages also consisting of loans along with full-time enrollment increased the probability of associate's degree completion at community colleges. Findings from this study support the proposal by Romano and Palmer (2016) for the federal government to restructure the student federal loans program under one program, increase the number of loans issued, and increase the dollar amount of a loan (to offset grant aid) to students. To reduce the risk of gaps in repayment, loan default, and the adverse effects to the student's credit, Romano and Palmer (2016) also suggest repayment of loans by deducting payments from future income or payroll. Recommendations for future research. Given the limited empirical data on associate's degree completers in engineering and engineering technologies, the present exploratory study brings greater attention to this population and serves as a starting point for future studies. There are several directions future research can take. For example, findings from this study raise subsequent questions about the impact of other pre-college student characteristics. Along those same lines, the present climate of engineering education, institutional variants of academic or social integration, and livedexperiences of specific populations of students (e.g., historically under-represented groups, returning students, students seeking a career change, those pursuing a second degree) enrolled in these programs are invaluable perspectives to understanding persistence-to-completion. Lastly, one can also engage in the exploration of other student outcomes of sub-baccalaureate engineering education such as post-completion employment and earnings, skills and knowledge acquisition, and attrition. Future research projects could include, but are not limited to: 1. Multiple regression analyses to include other confounding, intrinsic and extrinsic, studentrelated variables excluded from this study (i.e., motivation, mentorship, commitment). 2. Replication of the present study using the BPS: 04/09 restricted-use dataset and fewer independent variables for a larger sample size. 9. The development of a framework related to student outcomes at community colleges in STEM subjects taking into account students' pre-college experiences and environment.  "}]
