[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Risk factors and cognitive sequelae of brain arteriolosclerosis pathology are not fully understood. To address this, we used multimodal data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data sets. Previous studies showed evidence of distinct neurodegenerative disease outcomes and clinicalpathological correlations in the ''oldest-old'' compared to younger cohorts. Therefore, using the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center data set, we analyzed clinical and neuropathological data from two groups according to ages at death: < 80 years (n \u00bc 1008) and !80 years (n \u00bc 1382). In both age groups, severe brain arteriolosclerosis was associated with worse performances on global cognition tests. Hypertension (but not diabetes) was a brain arteriolosclerosis risk factor in the younger group. In the ! 80 years age at death group, an ABCC9 gene variant (rs704180), previously associated with aging-related hippocampal sclerosis, was also associated with brain arteriolosclerosis. A post-hoc arterial spin labeling neuroimaging experiment indicated that ABCC9 genotype is associated with cerebral blood flow impairment; in a convenience sample from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (n \u00bc 15, homozygous individuals), non-risk genotype carriers showed higher global cerebral blood flow compared to risk genotype carriers. We conclude that brain arteriolosclerosis is associated with altered cognitive status and a novel vascular genetic risk factor."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Cerebrovascular pathologies affecting small arteries and arterioles are common findings in the aged brain [1] [2] [3] and are often seen in brains of persons with dementia. [4] [5] [6] [7] Here, we focused on brain arteriolosclerosis (B-ASC), a subtype of cerebral small vessel pathology characterized by degenerative wall thickening of arterioles. [8] [9] [10] The true prevalence of B-ASC is unknown but has been observed in 39-80% of autopsied elderly individuals. 11, 12 The pathologic changes of B-ASC include hypertrophy and/or death of vascular smooth muscle cells and extracellular deposition of elastin and collagen. 1, 2, 13, 14 In the present study, we sought to better understand the risk factors and global cognitive status associated with B-ASC pathology among aged individuals.\nHypertension and diabetes are presumed risk factors for arteriolosclerosis (ASC) in the brain and other organs. Chronic hypertension is associated with ASC pathology in the brain, kidney, and other organs. [15] [16] [17] Hypertensive animal models have thicker cerebral arteriolar walls, larger vessel cross-sectional areas, and smaller inner arteriolar diameters compared to control animals. 18, 19 Diabetic patients have thicker subcutaneous gluteal arteriolar walls and larger cross-sectional areas compared to controls. 20, 21 Diabetic animal models have thicker retinal capillary walls 22 and renal arteriolar glomerular basement membranes 23 compared to controls. In addition to clinical risk factors, recent studies suggest that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in ABCC9, ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 9, may be a genetic risk factor for B-ASC pathology in older elderly individuals. Evidence in support of the link between an ABCC9 SNP and B-ASC pathology are as follows: (1) The rs704180 SNP located in ABCC9 is associated with hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging), 24 ,25 a neurodegenerative disease affecting individuals >80 years at death. 8, 26 (2) Individuals with HS-Aging have worse B-ASC pathology compared to individuals without HS-Aging pathology. 8 ( 3) The gene product of ABCC9 is a subunit of ATP-sensitive potassium channels found in vascular smooth muscle cells, including arterioles. 27 Thus, by extension, ABCC9 gene variants may constitute a risk factor for B-ASC pathology in elderly individuals. However, this credible hypothesis has not been tested previously.\nAs the clinical and genetic risk factors for B-ASC are imperfectly understood, so is the cognitive impairment associated with this pathology. Studies on the global cognitive status of patients with B-ASC have included the analyses of Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, 28 Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) scores, 29 and CDR Sum of Boxes (CDRSUM) scores. 30 The MMSE is an assessment tool used in measuring global cognitive function, 31 while the CDR is a measure of a person's ability to accomplish activities of daily living. 32, 33 The CDRSUM score is derived by summing scores from all CDR domains. 34 Prior analyses of data from 334 elderly individuals did not reveal an association between B-ASC pathology and MMSE scores. 28 However, in an autopsy study with 52 cases, widespread B-ASC pathology in cases with Alzheimer's disease (AD) was associated with worse global CDR scores. 29 Similarly, in an autopsy study using 715 AD cases with CDRSUM information, researchers found that high B-ASC severity was associated with worse CDRSUM scores. 30 Conflicting results from these studies may be due to a number of experimental factors including small sample size (statistical power), particular cognitive domains affected by small blood vessel pathologies, frequent presence of comorbid pathologies, and parameters that vary in different parts of the human aging spectrum.\nIn order to gain insight into B-ASC risk factors and global cognitive status while factoring in other dementia-associated pathologies, we analyzed a subset of individuals from the National Alzheimer's Disease Coordinating Center (NACC) data set. Because there is evidence of distinct neurodegenerative outcomes and clinical-pathological correlation differences between the ''younger-old'' and ''oldest-old'' persons, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] we analyzed groups separately according to ages at death:-< 80 years and !80 years. The goals of the study were to determine if autopsy-verified B-ASC is associated with global cognitive status, to assess the association between vascular risk factors and B-ASC pathology, and to determine the relationship between ABCC9 HS-Aging risk genotype and B-ASC pathology. In order to further test the association between the ABCC9 HS-Aging risk genotype and B-ASC pathology, we studied the relationship between the ABCC9 HS-Aging risk genotype and cerebral blood flow (CBF) (a possible in vivo manifestation of B-ASC pathology). Genetic and neuroimaging data on a sub-sample of individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data set were used to test this association."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "This study used data from the NACC and ADNI data sets.

Archival data from September 2005 through December 2013 were obtained for this study.\nThe initial pulled archival data from the NACC data set comprised 29,483 cases. Living cases (n \u00bc 26,686) and autopsied cases with missing information which would preclude making an assessment of B-ASC status (n \u00bc 407) were excluded from the analysis. For analysis, cases were split into two age at death groups: < 80 years (n \u00bc 1008) and !80 years (n \u00bc 1382).\nThe ADNI data set is from a multicenter longitudinal study in the United States and Canada in which subjects with normal cognition, MCI and AD were followed with cognitive testing, neuroimaging techniques, and other biomarker. 46 A convenience sample (n \u00bc 15) of rs704180 homozygous (A_A or G_G genotype) individuals was used for CBF analysis. Neither other scans nor SNPs were assessed from ADNI.\nCognitive and functional assessment in the NACC data set MMSE (0-30; 30 \u00bc no global impairment) and CDRSUM (0-18; 0 \u00bc no global impairment) scores were used as measures of global cognitive status. [31] [32] [33] Scores from the most recent ADC clinical visit before each individual's death were used (median interval between final visit and death: 0.83 years).\nClinical, neuropathologic, and genetic parameters in the NACC data set Clinical data were obtained from each participant's final ADC clinical visit before death. During clinical research visits, medical histories were obtained from subjects, caregivers (particularly if the subject was cognitively impaired), and/or patient records. The following self-reported vascular risk factors and cerebrovascular diseases were used in the analyses: medical histories of hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, sex, smoking, stroke, and atrial fibrillation. Responses were coded initially as unknown, absent, recent/active, or remote/inactive, and subsequently, ''recent'' and ''remote'' responses were combined into one category (i.e. history of a condition) for analytical purposes. Body mass index (BMI) values were derived from height and weight measurements. Pack years were derived from self-reported cigarette packs smoked per day and years of smoking.\nNeuropathologic details from all cases included Braak staging, 48 CERAD neuritic plaque densities, 49 and other parameters as described in detail previously. 44 In the NACC Neuropathology Data Set Coding Guidebook version 9.1 (https://www.alz. washington.edu/WEB/forms_np.html), B-ASC was described as ''hyalinosis of the media and adventitia of small parenchymal and/or leptomeningeal vessels.'' B-ASC pathology was diagnosed using a semiquantitative four-tier categorization system with responses scored to indicate ''none'', ''mild'', ''moderate'', or ''severe'' B-ASC pathology. In the NACC guidebook, neuropathologists were instructed to estimate the overall severity of B-ASC pathology. No specific brain region for B-ASC pathological diagnosis was mentioned; thus, this diagnostic methodology was left to the discretion of each individual neuropathologist and/or research center.\nGenetic data were obtained and analyzed as described previously. 24, 25 Briefly, the Alzheimer's Disease Genetic Consortium (ADGC) accrued genetic data from 29 different ADCs, with multiple iterations of SNP data, [50] [51] [52] which were analyzed together with neuropathological and clinical data gathered through NACC. 53 The three alleles identified were analyzed according to ADGC SNP nomenclature and were GRN.rs5848 (A/G), TMEM106B.rs1990622 (A/G; note that other reports have used T/C for this allele: the ''A'' allele is analogous to ''T'' allele in other reports, whereas the ''G'' allele we report is analogous to ''C'' allele), and ABCC9.rs704180 (A/G). 24, 25 APOE e4 genotype information from NACC was also used in the analysis because APOE alleles are known to be associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), which could lead to vascular wall distortions. 54 Neuroimaging and genetic parameters in ADNI data set T 1 -weighted brain MRI scans were acquired using a sagittal MP-RAGE sequence following the ADNI MRI protocol. 47, 55 Arterial spin labeling (ASL) images were obtained from ADNI data set. Data from 15 Caucasian individuals were acquired from six different American research centers using a standardized pulsed arterial spin labeling (pASL) protocol: Field Strength Control and label images were subtracted, and quantitative CBF (mL/100 g/min units) was calculated using in-house Matlab software using the following equation 56, 57 and then correlated with genotyping\nwhere k was the brain/blood partition coefficient in mL/g, SI control and SI label were the time-averaged signal intensities in the control and label images, respectively, T 1,blood was the longitudinal relaxation time of blood in seconds, a was the labeling efficiency, M 0 was the equilibrium brain tissue magnetization, TI 1 was post-labeling delay, and TI 2 was the label duration.

Initially, a Chi-square test, a Mann-Whitney U test, or a Kruskal-Wallis test were used to determine possible risk factors for B-ASC severity in the two age at death groups. A Chi-square test was applied for categorical variables, whereas a Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis test was applied for continuous non-normally distributed variables. Subsequently, clinical variables that yielded a p < 0.05 in these analyses were included as independent variables in an ordinal logistic regression to further elucidate the association between clinical variables and B-ASC pathology while controlling for confounding effects. The variables in this logistic regression model included age at death, sex, hypertension, diabetes, smoking pack years, and hypercholesterolemia. Logistic regression modeling was used to determine the association between the ABCC9 HS-Aging risk genotype and B-ASC pathology. Age at death, sex, hypertension, diabetes, pack years, and hypercholesterolemia were used as covariates. Mild, moderate and severe B-ASC pathologies were collapsed into one category and treated as a dependent variable.\nA linear regression model was used to assess the association between B-ASC pathology with MMSE and CDRSUM scores. B-ASC pathology was treated as the main independent variable. MMSE or CDRSUM scores were treated as dependent variables while adjusting for age at death, sex, Braak neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) stage, presence of any microinfarcts, presence of neocortical Lewy bodies, and presence of HS-Aging pathology. Adjusted mean MMSE and CDRSUM scores derived from the linear regression analyses were reported for each B-ASC severity category and compared using the least squares method.\nIn order to assess the relationship between the ABCC9 HS-Aging risk genotype and CBF, a possible manifestation of B-ASC pathology, a Welch's two sample t-test was used to compare CBF measurements between individuals with the ABCC9 HS-Aging homozygous non-risk and risk genotypes.

Individuals used in these analyses were predominantly (>90%) Caucasian (data not shown), and median year at death was 2010 (range: 2005-2013). In order to convey examples of blood vessel profiles representing the spectrum of B-ASC pathology, images were obtained from four human brain sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) ( Figure 2 ). The percentage of individuals with B-ASC pathology trended upward with increasing age at death. (Figure 1(b) ). When stratifying by age at death, the percentage of individuals with moderate or severe B-ASC pathology was higher in older age at death groups (p < 0.0001) (Figure 1(c) ). These results indicate that B-ASC is a common pathology in the NACC data set, becoming more severe with increasing age at death.\nAs a result of prior studies showing different outcomes and clinical-pathological correlations in the ''oldest old,'' [35] [36] [37] we analyzed the overall cohort in two separate age groups. More specifically, the cutoff of 80 years was chosen because it has been used before to help highlight neurodegenerative disease and/or neuropathologic features that differ -often quite dramatically -among the ''oldest-old''. [39] [40] [41] [58] [59] [60] Furthermore, this cutoff was close to the overall cohort mean (80.0 years) and median (82.0 years) age at death. Comparing the two age at death groups in the NACC data set, individuals in the !80 years age at death group were more often female, hypertensive, and less often impaired cognitively when compared to individuals in the <80 years age at death group (Table 1 ). In addition, individuals in the !80 years age at death group were less likely to show ''high'' levels of AD pathology, but more likely to show B-ASC and HS-Aging pathologies at autopsy, compared to individuals in the <80 years age at death group.

The presence of severe B-ASC pathology was associated with global cognitive impairment. In addition, a neuroimaging CBF experiment further supports the association between the ABCC9 HS-Aging risk genotype and B-ASC. Potential risk factors for B-ASC included advanced age at death, hypertension, and sex. In younger individuals (age at death < 80 years), hypertension was associated with B-ASC. However, this association was not observed in older individuals (age at death ! 80 years). In the ! 80 years age at death group, the ABCC9 HS-Aging risk genotype was associated with B-ASC pathology. These findings suggest that B-ASC risk factors are age dependent. For example, hypertension appears to have a strong role in younger elderly individuals, while at least one genetic factor (ABCC9) may affect the B-ASC risk in the ''oldest-old''.\nThere are potential limitations in this study. The NACC data set is not a population-based data set; it is better characterized as a clinical series of persons enrolled at ADCs, and in addition, carries known biases associated with autopsy cohorts. 42, 43, 53, 61 As a result, NACC participants are predominantly Caucasian, highly educated, and are drawn predominantly from dementia clinics. 42, 44 Due to the lack of socioeconomic information and low sampling of individuals from different ethnic/racial groups, race and ethnicity were not included in the regression models. The data on clinical disease risk factors are largely self-reported, which can lead to an underestimation of the true disease frequencies. 62 In addition, duration of disease (i.e. hypertension) data was not available; therefore, it was not adjusted for in the regression models. We found that female sex was associated with An ordinal logistic regression model was applied in both age at death groups using vascular risk factors identified from exploratory analysis (see Supplementary Table 2 ).

Although this association survived in a regression model that accounted for other factors including age at death, these data should be interpreted with caution and future work is merited in this area. The NACC neuropathology data set coding guidebook does not suggest optimal brain sections for B-ASC diagnosis. As a result, B-ASC diagnostic methods are inconsistent across ADCs. Although non-NACC guidelines exist for B-ASC diagnosis, 63 different ADCs have reported using the basal ganglia 64 or a ''global'' 8 criteria in the diagnosis of B-ASC. In a prior, non-ADC autopsy study with 135 vascular dementia brains, B-ASC was seen in the frontal lobe (83.7% of cases), temporal lobe (80.7% of cases), and basal ganglia (89.6% of cases). 65 Because the diagnosis of B-ASC is presently based on H&E staining, other pathologies that lead to a distortion of vascular walls (i.e. CAA) may mistakenly be diagnosed as B-ASC, leading to a biased estimation of B-ASC frequency. However, we saw a strong correlation between APOE status and CAA severity, but no correlation between APOE status and B-ASC severity in our sample, indicating that these pathologies are at least partly independent. In the future, improved methodologies and consensus for B-ASC pathologic diagnosis should improve the specificity of B-ASC operationalization. Until then, it can be argued that a multicenter approach, combining data from dozens of neuropathologists, each applying center-specific diagnostic rubrics, is the best way to achieve an outcome that is representative of what any given neuropathologist would define as ''brain arteriolosclerosis.'' Despite the challenges inherent to a retrospective cross-sectional study, the NACC and ADNI databases provide relatively high-quality contexts to study clinical, genetic, neuroimaging, and/or pathological correlations. Detailed cognitive assessments, genetic, and neuropathological data have allowed us to study associations of B-ASC with cognitive status and both clinical and genetic variables. These include both ''traditional'' ASC risk factors (hypertension and diabetes), as well as novel genetic aspects (ABCC9 SNP). Mixed pathologies are frequently seen in the aged brain 30, 66, 67 and detailed neuropathological data from NACC allowed us to adjust for other dementia-inducing pathologies in our analyses. B-ASC is a common cerebrovascular pathology that is often seen in a complex milieu along with other brain diseases 30 and has been associated with motor impairment in advanced old age. 12 In this NACC-ADC data set, the frequency of any B-ASC pathology (mild, moderate, and severe) was 75.3%, and became more severe with increasing age at death, which is consistent with findings from other autopsy cohorts. 11, 68, 69 We showed that B-ASC pathology was associated with worse MMSE and CDRSUM scores after adjusting for co-morbid cognitive impairment-inducing pathologies. Prior studies reporting the cognitive profiles of B-ASC are limited, mostly focusing on patients diagnosed with vascular dementia (a very heterogeneous condition). [5] [6] [7] Although both age at death groups had MMSE and CDRSUM scores indicative of cognitive impairment, individuals in <80 age at death group were more globally impaired compared to individuals in the !80 years age at death group. This finding may be attributed to the differing frequencies of AD and B-ASC pathologies present in the two age at death groups: higher number of individuals with ''high'' AD pathology in < 80 years age at death group and higher number of individuals with moderate or severe B-ASC pathology in ! 80 years age at death group. Individuals with AD pathology exhibit greater deficits in memory function and faster rates of information decay compared to individuals with cerebrovascular disease. 70 Our study provided quantitative evidence to support the hypothesis that B-ASC is associated with worse cognitive status independent of other brain changes. Furthermore, it underscores the importance of identifying risk factors, specific neuroimaging abnormalities, and potential treatments of B-ASC, in order to prevent or reverse its development later in life.\nHypertension is a major risk factor for B-ASC. 16, 71 In an autopsy study, Moritz and Oldt 16 observed that B-ASC pathology was more severe in the hypertensive group compared to the non-hypertensive group. 16 In the < 80 age at death group, we found hypertension to be associated with B-ASC. However, in the ! 80 age at death group, there was no association detected between B-ASC and hypertension, and these results did not change after adjusting for anti-hypertensive medication use. Similarly, in an autopsy study consisting of 70 cases with B-ASC, 31% of cases were normotensive with 10 of these cases having an age at death !80 years. 71 These results suggest that hypertension may not be the only risk factor for B-ASC pathology in older elderly individuals.\nWe hypothesize that the known strong impact(s) of diabetes on brain function may be mediated through a combination of vascular and metabolic etiologies. 72 We did not find support for the direct impact of diabetes on B-ASC, but there was a trend between diabetes and B-ASC in the younger cohort. We note that there was not a distinction between Type 1 or Type II diabetes in the NACC data set, although the majority is presumed to be Type II diabetes. Evidently, beyond the ''usual suspects'', there are additional, currently unknown risk factors for B-ASC in advanced old age.\nOne category of risk factors that may be relevant to B-ASC pathology in the ''oldest-old'' is genetics, and we here provide support for a specific candidate risk allele. The ABCC9 SNP rs704180 was previously associated with risk for HS-Aging, 24 ,25 a hippocampal pathology seen in $10-25% of autopsied individuals beyond 80 years at death. 26, [73] [74] [75] Recently, we found an association between HS-Aging and B-ASC in three separate cohorts, including the NACC data set. 8 Using digital image methods for analysis of arteriolar morphology, we found that HS-Aging cases had larger vessel areas, vessel perimeters, vascular areas, and vessel wall thicknesses compared to non HS-Aging cases. 8 Research from a different cohort, using different neuropathological scoring, and statistical methods, reported that moderate B-ASC (but not severe or mild) was associated with hippocampal atrophy. 76 Because of all these findings collectively, we hypothesized that the ABCC9 HS-Aging risk genotype is associated with B-ASC in advanced old age, possibly upstream of the risk for HS-Aging (Figure 4(d) ). The present study showed an association between the ABCC9 HS-Aging risk genotype and B-ASC pathology in cases with an age at death !80 years. There was no evidence of that association among individuals with age at death <80 years.\nIn order to test the association between the ABCC9 HS-Aging risk genotype and B-ASC, we analyzed CBF in elderly individuals. The rationale for this experiment includes that (1) B-ASC is associated with white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on MRI scans, [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] and (2) WMHs have been correlated with decreases in CBF [82] [83] [84] and cognitive impairment. [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] We found the ABCC9 HS-Aging risk genotype to be associated with decreased CBF in elderly individuals. These findings support the hypothesis that the ABCC9 HS-Aging risk genotype promotes B-ASC in the oldest-old with decreases in CBF on neuroimaging. ABCC9 encodes a regulator of ATP-sensitive potassium channels that is expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells. [90] [91] [92] [93] The protein is important for vascular tone regulation and reactivity to metabolic factors and oxidative stress. 90, [94] [95] [96] We hypothesize that gene variants in ABCC9 could result in chronic perturbations of the neurovascular unit leading to decrease in CBF and B-ASC pathology. Therefore, the brain changes associated with ABCC9 gene variants may be part of a ''brain wide'' disease characterized by HS-Aging, TDP-43 pathology, and B-ASC in elderly individuals. 97, 98 Since TMEM106B and GRN SNPs were not associated with B-ASC pathology, we hypothesize that these are downstream in the pathological process of HS-Aging (Figure 4(b) ). Further studies are warranted to test this hypothesis.\nWe conclude that B-ASC is a common vascular pathology with a deleterious impact on global cognition in elderly individuals. Risk factors for B-ASC include hypertension, which has long been considered to be a putative modifiable factor, as well as advanced age. Additional possibly targetable mechanisms involved in the B-ASC pathogenesis are mostly unknown, but the results of this study offer candidate pathways involving ABCC9 gene products. Furthermore, we provide evidence that ASL neuroimaging is a potential candidate biomarker to indicate ABCC9-related variations in CBF that could be useful in a clinical setting. These findings may serve to increase awareness about B-ASC, a common cerebrovascular pathology associated with cognitive impairment. "}]
