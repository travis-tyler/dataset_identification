[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The current emergency of COVID-19 arose after the end of 2019 in Wuhan (China) and was officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020.\nIts causative agent was called novel coronavirus (nCoV), with a round or oval shape of this 60 to 140 nm enveloped structure 1 . Then, The Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses named it as SARS-CoV-2 2 based on genomic and phylogenetics analysis. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the Bat coronavirus isolate RaTG13, due to its homology in phylogenetics analysis 3 . Hence, SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus with more homology to RATG13 (around 96% sequence identity) and\nPangolin-CoV (91.02% identity) than to SARS-CoV (79% identity) or MERS (51.8% identity) viruses 1,3-6 .\nSARS-CoV-2 genome sequences allowed us to understand the organization of this virus, which has nearly 29,890 base pairs (GenBank NC_045512.2), with genes that produce 29\nproteins. These proteins are encoded by ten open reading frames (ORFs), the most important viral proteins are Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins. In addition, the ORF1ab can translate 16 non-structural proteins (nsp) 3 .\nGenomic studies from China, allowed us to understand that the virus could accumulate mutations meanwhile spreading across the world, with a probable moderate mutation rate 7 .\nFor instance, substitutions in positions 8750, 28112 were the hotspots and were useful to define two groups of strains, and nt29063 was used by scientists to subdivide these groups 8 ."}, {"section_title": "Accepted Article", "text": "Furthermore, another study evaluated 95 SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes and reported 13 February 9th 2020, and in a position of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp or nsp12) 9 .\nThese authors also found that positions 17746, 17857 and 18060 were points of recurrent mutations in viruses isolated from American or Canadian patients. 10 . Conversely, little information was collected with next generation sequencing (NGS) methodology in these countries.\nA huge amount of SARS-CoV-2 genomes has been sequenced in a short time around the globe, and a lot of research was published. Nevertheless, South American countries have poor genomic information and lack of genomic analysis. To this date, there is only one official report of SARS-CoV-2 in South America 11 , and another online publication from Brazil. Thus, we aim to show a first overview of phylogenetics relationships and genetic variations of SARS-CoV-2 in South America.\nAmerican countries from the GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) database. The alignment was carried out with Mauve 12 software, using the reference NC_045512.2 (from the initial report from Wuhan, China). The alignment was displayed in MEGA6 13 to extract nucleotide and amino acid mutations, for extracting the ten ORFs regions the positions were assessed according to a previous study 7 .\nAdditionally, we downloaded 688 genomes from the GISAID database 14 , the genomes were complete (>29,000bp) and with high coverage according to this public resource. Furthermore, to obtain representative sequences of the seven different continents we chose 5 to 7 day intervals of the first strain isolated in each continent. The alignment of the genomes was performed using MAFFT 15 . All gaps were replaced with N. The inference phylogenetics was used RaxML 16 with the model GTRCAT, with three rate categories and rapid hill-climbing to accelerate computations. The Treetine 17 software was used for phylodynamic analysis using an approximate Maximum Likelihood approach with defaults parameters, and a time clock model was used. Finally the tree obtained from RaxML was analyzed with grapetree 18 using a minimum spanning algorithm to explore the fine-grained population structure of South American genomes, related to continent expansion.\nWe aligned 30 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from South American isolates with the reference, demonstrating high homology with 29846 sites conserved, representing 99.98% of identity.\nGenomes have 57 SNPs sites in total ( Phylogenetics analysis of 688 genomes (Figure 1 ) was colored according to Tang et al. 19 , the mutation a23403g permits to assign 17 genomes related to Clade G (light purple), and the nucleotide change t28144c classify 8 genomes in the Clade S (light pink). On the other hand, five genomes did not belong to any clade. Figure 2 shows that clade G diverse and contains subtypes. At least one South American strain belongs to a subgroup of Clade G. It seems that 11 , and we assume the 02 other isolates could have been sampled from relatives or close people to patient zero. We hypothesize that our findings are related to the amount of samples of viral sequences which could not be done for other South American countries yet, or any other bias of sample selection. Furthermore, we were unable to include in our phylogenetic analysis viral genomes from Ecuador and Colombia, due to genome sequence quality. However, the GISAID SARS-CoV-2 portal (URL at: https://www.gisaid.org/epiflu-applications/next-hcov-19app/) depicts the close relationship between an isolate from Oceania (EPI ISL 417211) and the strain sequenced in Ecuador. This online tool also shows that one of the strains sequenced from Colombian patients was related to an Australian origin (EPI_ISL_419834)-closely related to the Chilean strain EPI_ISL_414578--whereas the other closely related to European origin from Germany or Switzerland.\nWe were able to classify strains according to previous suggestions 19 . We demonstrate that strains from Clade G were the most common throughout South America; with 68.75%, 14.29%, 50%, 100% of strains in Brazil (11/16), Chile (1/7), Colombia (1/2) and the latter percentage for Peru (1/1) and Argentina (3/3). Up to this report, we only have an official publication from Chile and we were able to confirm analysis from this group, except the change of an amino acid (G196V in our analysis) reported in one strain of Clade S as G193V 11 . Currently, 85.71% of Chilean strains pertain to S Clade followed by 50% and 6.25%\nfor Colombian and Brazilian isolates, respectively.

Thus, novel mutations on S protein, especially on these residues or nearly of them could be of importance. Our report highlights two strains with novel variants on the S region, with no amino acid change in nt24022 (E1207E) whereas another non-synonymous alteration in nt25182 (E1207V), for Peru (EPI_ISL_415787) and Ecuador (EPI_ISL_417482), respectively. However, these changes seem far away from the critical region of S protein for h-ACE2 affinity.\nDue to its prevalence across the world as in our sample of South American isolates, researchers are suggesting that Clade G strains could be more contagious than other subtypes; Zhang et al. 8 suggested that it could be related to synonymous changes due to nucleotide changes in ORF1ab (nt8750) and N (nt29063) genes, which could enhance viral replication due to higher translational efficiencies compared to other clades. Furthermore, another study showed that there are some positions where mutations could arise more frequently in subsequent SARS-CoV-2 strains, corresponding to nt8782 of ORF1a, nt28144 of ORF8 and nt29095 of N region 7 . We highlight differences with this report because we found variations 8 (8/30) in both of nt8782 and nt28144 positions. Conversely, other regions seem to be hotspots in South American strains, with 11(36.67%) of these portraying changes at 5'UTR (nt241), nsp3 (nt3037), nsp12 (nt14408), N/ORF9 (nt28881, nt28882 and nt28883).\nThis is relevant because changes in nsp1, nsp3 and nsp5 could be related to some functions of the viral incubation period and immune response evasion of SARS-CoV-2 21 .\nWe found amino acid alterations in both of these regions, such as G392D (nsp1), A876T and A1043 (nsp3) and nsp5 (G3334S); and should be tested in further studies. Strikingly, we This article is protected by copyright.

Compared to the reference genome, we found an average of 5 mutations per genome of the overall South American strains.\nOur study represents the first overview of SARS-CoV-2 strains genomic comparison and phylogenetic analysis in South America. Surprisingly, five of the studied strains lack current classification, and we were not able to track all the global distribution of this virus due to our sampling methodology. However, we consider that our study highlights important findings such as two novel mutations in the S region, and novel hotspots positions. In addition, some external limitations such as primers design variations of the ORF1b 23 or N regions, could have influenced the sequencing process on some isolates from South America 7, 24 . Some other limitations are the lack of epidemiological data for all patients (we mostly used media information or government's official websites), poor quality of some viral genome sequences;\nand specially the limited number of viral genomes reported in South America after almost two months of the arrival of SARS-CoV-2 to this part of the world. This must improve to identify mutations that could have an effect on the design of diagnostic and therapeutic measures, including vaccines or antiviral drugs 25 .\nWe should take into account that this is a novel virus and could have higher mutation rates than currently expected 7 , and genetic drift and founder effect could influence specific SARS-CoV-2 subsequent strains and mutations which would be geographically constrained for a while. Moreover, South America should urgently strengthen the genomic epidemiology field for the current and further pandemics."}, {"section_title": "Genomic analysis", "text": "Analyses were performed to obtain an overview of genomic SARS-CoV-2 mutations of circulating strains in South America; we download a total of 30 complete genomes of South This article is protected by copyright.
