Early diagnosis can be facilitated by neuroimaging techniques that can detect the earliest pathological and metabolic alterations that occur in neurodegenerative disease.\nIn this review, we discuss clinically relevant neuroimaging findings in a wide range of dementia syndromes, as well as cutting-edge techniques that are gaining traction in research. As we move toward the age of treatments designed for specific molecular targets (e.g., tau and amyloid), there is a growing need to move beyond simply classifying syndromes based entirely on clinical phenotypes to predicting underlying pathologies with greater precision using imaging, genetic, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and other objective markers of disease. In this review, we try to distinguish between imaging findings in pathologically proven versus clinically based diagnoses, placing particular emphasis on neuroimaging in pathologically confirmed cases as well as longitudinal neuroimaging studies. Dementia and related syndromes discussed in this review include AD, the frontotemporal dementia (FTD) spectrum, primary progressive aphasias (PPA), vascular dementia (VaD), Lewy body disease (LBD) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), rapidly progressing dementias (RPD), normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), and cerebellar disorders.

These changes lead to neuronal dysfunction and death, with subsequent atrophy of selectively vulnerable brain networks and emergent clinical features, including cognitive impairment. 4 Depending on the brain regions and networks that are affected, AD can present with a multitude of clinical syndromes, including, but not limited to, the classic amnestic syndrome, posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), a frontal/dysexecutive syndrome, and the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia (discussed in the Primary Progressive Aphasia section). Substantial research efforts aimed at studying biomarkers of AD, including the large-scale Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Imaging DementiaEvidence for Amyloid Scanning (IDEAS) studies, have shown that neuroimaging biomarkers improve clinical diagnosis in AD. In fact, current AD diagnostic criteria incorporate neuroimaging as a biomarker because it increases the degree of diagnostic certainty that the clinical presentation reflects underlying AD pathology (i.e., probable versus possible AD)."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": "Despite established criteria, however, AD remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for several reasons. First, the clinical expression of AD is variable in its phenotypic (i.e., syndromic) and endophenotypic (e.g., network vulnerability or genetic) features. 5 Furthermore, the presence of AD pathology does not mean that cognitive deficits are detected, as about one-third of cognitively nonimpaired people at around age 75, and half of those around age 85, have in vivo markers [amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scan] of underlying AD pathology. 6 Additionally, AD pathology often co-exists with other pathologies, such as synucleinopathies and vascular disease, that contribute to cognitive deficits, raising uncertainty about direct causality between specific underlying pathology and predominant clinical syndrome."}, {"section_title": "7", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "MRI", "text": "Although the earliest site of AD pathology is often phosphotau accumulation in brainstem nuclei, 8, 9 the earliest atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is detected in the cerebrum. 10 In the classic amnestic AD syndrome, early atrophy can be appreciated in the hippocampi and precuneus (\u25baFig. 1). 10 Interestingly, however, hippocampal atrophy is best linked to APOE \u03b54 polymorphism and the amnestic pattern of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), but may not be a primary feature of early-onset (EOAD) presentations, which have more early posterior cortical involvement."}, {"section_title": "11-13", "text": "Many LOAD atrophy patients also often have prominent posterior involvement, 14 irrespective of the syndromic presentation; this pattern often can assist the clinician in discriminating AD from other pathologies that can manifest with similar clinical syndromes.

Patients with CBS due to underlying AD pathology have parietal-predominant atrophy, in contrast to the frontal-predominant atrophy of CBS due to FTLD pathology. 15 Thus, identifying posterior-predominant atrophy (i.e., precuneus and posterior cingulate) on imaging is suggestive of underlying AD pathology, as it generally is a feature across AD syndromes (\u25baFig. 1).
