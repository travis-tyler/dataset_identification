Because of the variation in median B.A.-Ph.D. time loose, it was felt that the academic rank data'might present an inaccurate minority/white salary comparison, and that a more accurate pictuil might be revealed by distributing the academic salaries by years of professional experience as well. The data, however, are not adequate to report the salaries of'each--group by years of experience for each academic rank., 51 b9' V Differences between the annual median salaries of male and female Ph.Ds reflect a more consistent pattern (Table 5.4). Irrespective of racial/ethnic group, men who were employed in academe had median salarieS at least 10 perttnt higher than those of women , similarly employed. The highest salaries for women in academe were earned by U.S.-born blacks with science or engineering degrees whose salaries of $23,70G were more than 10 percent higher than U.S. In the humanities, the median salary of U.S.-born black men ($25,800) was somewhat highan that of U.S:-born white_men ($23,800).,  In general, however, the data show that nonacademic salaries are higher than academic. 0   The data on median annual salaries are disaggregated by field of doctorate in Table 5.7.

The 2,040 individuals in the total sample of 51,711 who were known to.be deceased or out2of-scope 'prior to the survey were excluded from the survey and weighted by their sample weight. The responses received from . the survey sample (32,877) were assigned a response weight that is the 0 product of the weight for nonresponse and the sample weight. Table B.1 shows the classification of the sample and the formulas used for caicu,leti the weights. Each 'stratum with fewer than two responses was merged with a similarly defined, stratum in order to calculate samplir errors. Respondents in each straVm were assigned a weight equal to the integral part of the stratum's response weight, or the integral part plu \u00a7 one. Allocation of weights within a stratum was Made at random's\u00b0 as'to represent the stratum population. This technique avoids the necessity' of rounding factional estimates of totals. For example, consider a stratum which contains 60 individuals of whom 15 were selected for the Sample . One of the-15 is known to be deCeased prior to the survey.  The sampling error is a measure of the precisfon with which a statistic derived from a survey sample approximates tie true population parameter being estimated. A confidence -interval can be established around the sample statistic on the assumption that the sample statistic is normallydkAtributed around the truepppulation parameter. Under this assumption, the probability that the estimate lies within one sampling error of the actual 'parameter is about .67; within two sampling errors, about ,95ciqdwithin three sampi4n4 errors, about .99. For example, given a survey estimate of 50 percent with a sampling error of 5 pIrcent, one can infe that the likelihood that the true population parameter is between 45 and 55 percent is .67. There is a .95 likelihood that the estimate falls between 40 and 60 percent, and .99 likelihood between 35 and 65 percent. Most of the statistics presented in this rtrt are ratios of two weighted sums of responses to the 1979 Survey of Doctorate 1 1 Recipients. As noted in Chapter 1, the. SDR is a stratified random sample, that is, the population was divided into selected subgroups or strata. These subgroups were then sampled using variable sampling rates in order to provide sufficient coverage of small subgroups a (such as racial/ethnic minorities and women). Sampling errors for such samples can be calculated using a formula which takes into account the number of survey respondents in,each stratum of the sample.* A useful approximation of the sampling errors of the statistics presented in percentage form iri this report can be obtained from n is the number of sample cases in the variable-specified category (e.g., doctoral scientists and engineers' in the U.S. labor force). The finite population correction factor, fpc = ( [N-n) / [N-1)) \"2; has been omitted from the calculations, since the fpc has negligible,effect on the statistics in this report, except when the estimate applies to a subgroup that h)s a high sampling rate. In any case, the omission of the fpc in the formula for s P yields a Conservative estimate (i.e., a higher estimate) of the sampling error. The sample sizes for the subgroups on which the population ft estimates given in this report were based are givencin Table C.2. These sample numbers can be used to construct approxi sampling errors for particular statistics mentioned in the report. This can be done either by using the formula for s or by referring tp Table C approximately a 95 percent interval, etc."}, {"section_title": "SAMPLING ERROR ESTIMATES FOR MEDIAN SALARIES*", "text": "Salary medians were not reported when the sampling error for an estimated median salary exceeded \u00b1 $2,000.
