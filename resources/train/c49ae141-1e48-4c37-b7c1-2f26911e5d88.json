[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Sea level rise (SLR) threatens coastal wetlands worldwide, yet the fate of individual wetlands will vary based on local topography, wetland morphology, sediment dynamics, hydrologic processes, and plant-mediated feedbacks. Local variability in these factors makes it difficult to predict SLR effects across wetlands or to develop a holistic regional perspective on SLR response for a diversity of wetland types. To improve regional predictions of SLR impacts to coastal wetlands, we developed a model that addresses the scale-dependent factors controlling SLR response and accommodates different levels of data availability. The model quantifies SLR-driven habitat conversion within wetlands across a region by predicting changes in individual wetland hypsometry. This standardized approach can be applied to all wetlands in a region regardless of data availability, making it ideal for modeling SLR response across a range of scales. Our model was applied to 105 wetlands in southern California that spanned a broad range of typology and data availability. Our findings suggest that if wetlands are confined to their current extents, the region will lose 12% of marsh habitats (vegetated marsh and unvegetated flats) with 0.6 m of SLR (projected for 2050) and 48% with 1.7 m of SLR (projected for 2100). Habitat conversion was more drastic in wetlands with larger proportions of marsh habitats relative to subtidal habitats and occurred more rapidly in small lagoons relative to larger sites. Our assessment can inform management of coastal wetland vulnerability, improve understanding of the SLR drivers relevant to individual wetlands, and highlight significant data gaps that impede SLR response modeling across spatial scales.\nThis approach augments regional SLR assessments by considering spatial variability in SLR response drivers, addressing data gaps, and accommodating wetland diversity, which will provide greater insights into regional SLR response that are relevant to coastal management and restoration efforts.\narchetypes, climate change, coastal management, coastal wetlands, habitat change, hypsometry, vulnerability"}, {"section_title": "", "text": "relative SLR experienced along a coast are highly variable in time and space (Cazenave & Le Cozannet, 2013) . At continental or regional scales, these factors include the gravitational properties and movement of the earth's surface King et al., 2012; Riva, Bamber, Lavall\u00e9e, & Wouters, 2010) , and the circulation and volume of the ocean due to shifting surface winds, melting land ice contributions, and the thermal expansion of seawater (Church et al., 2013; Rhein et al., 2013) . Subregional and local processes include tectonics, coastal geomorphology, and hydrology (Behrens, Brennan, & Battalio, 2015; Cahoon et al., 2006; Rich & Keller, 2013) .\nThe variability associated with these SLR drivers makes it difficult to predict how SLR will affect coastal wetlands across broad spatial scales. The fate of individual wetlands will be determined by local rates of SLR, local topography, and wetland morphology, but SLR response will be further mediated by biogeomorphic feedbacks among inundation, plant growth, organic matter accretion, and sediment deposition (Kirwan et al., 2010; Mueller, Jensen, & Megonigal, 2016) . Biogeomorphic feedbacks control vertical accretion and wetland elevation and so are important in determining response to SLR (Morris, Sundareshwar, Nietch, Kjerfve, & Cahoon, 2002) . These complex interactions determine which wetland sites may be able to keep pace with rising sea levels and which will not (Kirwan, Temmerman, Skeehan, Guntenspergen, & Faghe, 2016) . Consideration of the spatial variability in both SLR drivers and SLR response mechanisms is necessary to compare SLR effects across individual wetlands.\nThe ability of SLR assessments to accommodate spatial variability in driver and response mechanisms is determined by data availability and computational modeling capability. Large-scale assessments, that is, regional, national, continental, or global (Gornitz, 1991; Klein & Nicholls, 1999; Spencer et al., 2016) , are purposefully designed to provide synoptic insights into SLR impacts by lowering computational expense and simplifying representation of the processes driving SLR (Fagherazzi et al., 2012) . Large-scale assessments are often conducted at spatial resolutions of 1 km 2 or greater (Passeri et al., 2015) or characterize sites or segments of coastline under a broad classification scheme (Lentz et al., 2016; Nicholls, 2004; Spencer et al., 2016) . Using broad classes and coarse spatial scales can obscure entire systems and some wetland types within a region, potentially biasing overall conclusions of wetland change.\nConversely, fine-scale assessments are better equipped to capture spatial variability at local scales (meters to 10 s of meters) within individual wetlands. For example, process-based models such as the Wetland Accretion Rate Model for Ecosystem Resilience (WARMER) (Swanson et al., 2014) , the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) (Clough, Park, Propato, Polaczyk, & Fuller, 2012) , the Marsh Equilibrium Model (MEM; Morris et al., 2002) , and the integrated Hydro-MEM (Alizad, Hagen, Morris, Bacopoulous et al., 2016) incorporate biogeomorphic feedbacks associated with inundation, plant growth, organic matter accretion, and sediment deposition. When used in conjunction with site-specific data on vegetation and/or elevation, the results can provide insights into SLR response at high spatial resolutions ; Thorne et al., 2018) . However, such comprehensive modeling efforts are often specific to a single wetland site and are difficult to replicate over broad geographic ranges for a variety of wetlands due to time and resource constraints.\nThe limitations inherent to large-scale and fine-scale assessments have led to geographical gaps in our understanding of SLR response.\nThe availability and accessibility of relevant data, as well as bias in assessment design caused by stakeholder incentives and resource availability, also contribute to these gaps (Preston, Yuen, & Westaway, 2011) . As a result, modeling efforts are normally conducted in well-studied and data-rich regions, wetland types, or specific sites.\nThe remaining, less-studied areas warrant attention, given that SLR response is highly context-dependent. However, coastal wetland types with similar origin, geomorphology, dynamics, sediment balance, biogeochemistry, and ecology will respond similarly to SLR and can therefore be grouped into a typology to provide a framework for the transfer of knowledge from data-rich to data-poor wetlands (Vafeidis et al., 2008) . Here, coastal wetland typology reflects general classes such as small deltas, tidal systems, lagoons, large rivers, estuaries, and bays (D\u00fcrr et al., 2011) . The inclusion of all wetlands and wetlands types would provide a more holistic regional perspective on SLR response that is required by both local and regional management efforts to ensure the resiliency of coastal ecosystem networks in the future (Gilmer, Brenner, & Sheets, 2012; Stralberg et al., 2011) .\nThis study aims to develop a nested SLR response assessment model that can be used to estimate SLR-induced habitat change across large geographic regions containing diverse wetland types.\nOur work augments current regional SLR assessments, bridging the gap between coarse regional and detailed site-specific models by addressing (a) the spatial variability of SLR drivers and response, (b) the ability to assess wetlands of different sizes and typologies using a common approach, and (c) the need to accommodate differences in data availability across sites. We conducted our assessment in the southern California region, which has a diverse range of wetland typologies representing many of the wetland types found globally, including Mediterranean areas, which have often been overlooked by previous SLR assessments. In addition, data availability varies a great deal for wetlands across southern California. Model outputs provide relative estimates of change in habitat composition for local (site specific) and regional scales, which are necessary to inform regional SLR adaptation efforts in southern California. Our goal is to estimate overall wetland losses for the region due to future SLR and explore how relative losses would vary among wetland types. The modeling approach is also highly relevant to other coastal regions throughout the world where predicting future SLR response is complicated by habitat heterogeneity and limited data availability."}, {"section_title": "| MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "| Model overview", "text": "We developed a rule-based model that quantifies SLR-driven habitat conversion caused by the combined effects of SLR, accretion, and\nchanges in water levels due to estuary mouth dynamics (Figure 1) .\nThe model uses hypsometric data, the measure of land elevation in relation to sea level, as a standardized basis for quantifying habitat change within individual wetlands across a region. Data gaps are addressed by incorporating the best available data at local to regional scales and by developing a wetland archetype framework to extrapolate data across similar wetland types. We conducted our assessment in southern California and parameterized our model using data collected for the 105 coastal wetlands found in the region (Table 1) . The model was executed for two SLR projections, 0.6 m by 2050 and 1.7 m by 2100, based on regional guidelines (California Coastal Commission, 2015; Griggs et al., 2017; National Research Council, 2012) .

Historically, this region contained over 300 coastal wetlands occupying approximately 19,591 ha of wetland habitat (Stein et al., 2014 (Stein et al., 2014) .\nThe existing wetland remnants are geographically isolated and constrained due to human modification of the landscape to serve urban development, military uses, industrial and agricultural expansion, recreation, and tourism (Zedler, 1982) ."}, {"section_title": "| Wetland archetype classification", "text": "We have grouped wetlands in this region into archetypes to facilitate extrapolation of data between wetlands to fill the gaps in our knowledge of the region. Archetypes represent wetlands with similar physical structure and ecosystem drivers that are expected to react in similar ways to SLR. To develop the archetypes, we compiled data on the physical structure and processes for each wetland in the region; these variables fell into five general categories including catchment properties, wetland dimensions (e.g., size and slope), proportion of subtidal to intertidal areas, inlet dimensions and area, and wetland volume and capacity. Of the 105 wetlands, 46 had sufficient data to be included in a K-Means cluster analysis where cluster numbers ranging from 4 to 8 were tested to maximize separation and minimize misclassification rates.\nThe resulting archetypes were further refined using a discriminant function analysis to identify the key predictor variables that generated the greatest accuracy of classification. Key predictors included wetland area, erosion area (area/depth), slope from mouth to head, integrated slope, mouth elevation, mean mouth width, total (Zedler, 1996) . Each of the 105 wetlands in the analysis was classified as one of the seven archetypes ( Figure 2 ). "}, {"section_title": "| Accretion", "text": "Empirical estimates of accretion in coastal wetlands in southern California were obtained through a review of published literature (Supporting information Table S1 ). The records included in the analysis were derived from radiocarbon dating, radiocesium dating, and paleoenvironmental soil core analysis of pollen and cover periods ranging from~30 to 10,000 years. Accretion estimates were standardized to millimeters per year (mm/year). Records reflecting short-term (<10 year) accretion and episodic sediment deposition from storms were excluded from the analysis to ensure that model inputs reflect long-term accretion rates on temporal scales comparable to SLR projections.\nBecause of the limited availability of published accretion records specific to this region (see Results), we used the archetype framework to extrapolate data from well-studied sites to data-poor sites.\nWhen empirical data were available for a given wetland, we used site-wide averages across all intertidal marsh zones as accretion input. For wetlands lacking empirical data, we calculated archetype accretion estimates from our literature review by aggregating records first by marsh zone within a site, then by site, and finally by archetype to provide inputs for similar sites specific to this region (Table 2) . Accretion rates for small creeks and lagoons were set to 0 mm/year because of a lack of empirical data and to avoid additional uncertainty associated with modeling fluvial sediment discharge. Contributions to accretion from both allochthonous and autochthonous inputs are relatively low for these systems given the variable precipitation patterns in southern California, small catchment sizes and the small vegetated areas associated with these systems."}, {"section_title": "| Mouth dynamics", "text": "We included an estuary mouth dynamics component in our assessment to address the intermittently opening and closing state of estuary mouths common to southern California and throughout the world (Rich & Keller, 2013) . Changing mouth state is a product of marine and fluvial drivers, such as wave energy and river discharge, which contribute to changes in estuary water levels by altering the height and position of terminal estuary bars. As estuary bars rise with sea level, the flood risk associated with estuary closure is expected to worsen (Behrens et al., 2015) . These changes can in turn affect extent and duration of inundation and therefore habitat distributions. To inform our model, we conducted a separate modeling analysis which includes a closure index (PWA, 2003; Williams & Cuffe, 1995) and a water balance model (Behrens, Bombardelli, Largier, & Twohy, 2013; Behrens et al., 2015) .\nThese analyses were conducted to estimate the probability of changing mouth state and the subsequent changes to estuary water levels for individual sites. We hypothesize that increased sea levels will increase the frequency of estuary closure, inducing a shift in dominant mouth state, and will ultimately increase water levels within a site. To test our hypothesis, we created a synthetic daily time series for current, 2050, and 2100 sea levels using local NOAA tide level data, Coastal Data Information Program (CDIP) water level and wave data, and Southern California Coastal Water Research Project (SCCWRP) coastal watershed runoff data for the last 20 years (Table 1) . To predict future closure indices, we manipulated wave and tidal inputs to reflect SLR projections of 0.6 m for 2050 and 1.7 m for 2100.\nIn order to estimate the probability of changing mouth state, we used the closure index (S) metric used by Williams and Cuffe (1995) and PWA (2003): \nwhere P w is wave power, \u03c1 is the constant 1 kg/L for water density, g is the constant 9.81 m s 2 for acceleration by gravity, H s is significant wave height, and C is wave group velocity (C = 1.56*s, where s is wave period). Tidal power (P t ) is also described above, where \u03b3 is the constant 1,000 kg unit weight of water, h T is the tidal range, b is the estuary mouth width, \u03a9 is tidal prism (\u03a9 = h T *A, where A is the water surface area of the basin), T is the ebb tide period, and Q is fluvial discharge. We estimated the daily likelihood of closure for each estuary over the entire time series.\nNext, we estimated how water levels may change in a given system when it is predicted to be open (S < 0.1) or closed (S > 0.1). In doing so, we made the assumption that every time closure risk is above the threshold, the system closes. This likely overpredicts mouth closure; however, we wanted to calculate the percent increase in predicted closure associated with SLR and the hypothetical changes to system water level based on the time series data.\nAlso, this mouth dynamics response threshold allowed us to repeat this process and compare outcomes for all systems where data were available. We estimated daily system water levels for systems with both \"open\" and \"closed\" conditions using a simplified model based on the work of Behrens et al. (2013 Behrens et al. ( , 2015 . When the system was at low risk of closure (S < 0.1), we assumed the system would be open and that system water level (\u03b7) would track mean sea level (MSL):\nwhen the system was at high risk of closure (S > 0.1), we assumed the system would be closed and that system water level (\u03b7) would be largely determined by the starting conditions of the estuary mouth and net fluvial inputs (Q net ):\nwhere \u03b7 t+1 is the future system water level, \u03b7 is current water level, Q net is the sum of fluvial inputs and evaporation, and Area \u03b7 is the surface area of the system at a given water level determined by system hypsometry. \nwhere z* is the relative elevation within the tidal range calculated as a dimensionless ratio of elevation referenced to mean sea level (MSL) and mean high high water (MHHW) from the nearest NOAA tidal station (Swanson et al., 2014) . z* was used in order to standardize estimates of elevation changes across wetlands with varying tidal datums, elevations, and tidal ranges. Standard hypsometric curves providing information on wetland elevation relative to sea level were created by cumulatively summing the area that falls within z* bins of 0.05."}, {"section_title": "| Changes in elevation and water level", "text": "Model components for SLR, accretion, and mouth dynamics were used to estimate changes in elevation and water level relative to our 2016 (t 0 ) baseline.

Changes in water level are used to manipulate the z* ranges that correspond to different wetlands habitats (Figure 1 , supporting information Table S2 ). z* ranges were informed by a synthesis of regional habitat-elevation data.\nWe calculated the area within three habitat classes (subtidal, unvegetated mudflat, and vegetated marsh) for each of the 105 wetlands under current sea levels and 0.6 m and 1.7 m SLR scenarios. We report the estimated changes to each habitat class and two metrics of wetland habitat loss. For the purpose of this study, wetland habitat loss reflects the combined loss of vegetated marsh and unvegetated mudflat areas, which assigns equal weight to these ecologically important classes and also aligns with ongoing regional efforts (SCWRP, 2018) . First, we calculated percent change as the difference in wetland area between the existing area and the predicted area under the SLR scenario divided by the existing area (hereafter \"percent change\").\nSecond, we calculated percent difference as the decrease in the percent of wetland area for each site between the existing conditions and the predicted conditions under the SLR scenarios to produce an estimate of the relative decrease in the percent of wetland area (hereafter \"percent difference\").

Large-scale assessments often provide a limited understanding of regional SLR response (Fagherazzi et al., 2012) . Recent global assess- closed mouth states due to fluvial, tidal, and wave drivers (Behrens et al., 2015) . These dynamic estuarine systems are present along the coasts of the Western United States, Mexico, South America, Europe, South Africa, Asia and Australia (McSweeney, Kennedy, Rutherfurd, & Stout, 2017) and are often underrepresent in large-scale assessments despite offering important ecosystems services such as refuge for endangered fish species (e.g., Swenson, 1999) . Incorporating estuary mouth dynamics into SLR response models is challenging because mouth dynamics are expected to be heavily influenced by SLR (Haines & Thom, 2007) and are difficult to model. Therefore, the difficulty in predicting mouth dynamics means that the interme- (Pontee, 2013) . Anthropogenic impacts such as habitat fragmentation and shoreline hardening in coastal wetlands will accelerate habitat loss with future SLR (Gittman et al., 2015) .\nHowever, even archetypes considered to be unmodified are also highly vulnerable to SLR. Larger archetypes, including intermediate estuaries, large lagoons, and river valley estuaries, will experience the greatest amount of habitat change in the region. Although these systems are characteristically large, predominantly comprised of wetland habitat, and have shallow grades ideal for upland migration, it is likely that allochthonous and autochthonous inputs to accretion will not be sufficient to maintain elevation with SLR in the long term.\nWithin these larger archetypes, there is also wider range of site responses, which reflects the intra-archetype diversity of system characteristics.\nIndeed, we found that site-level response to SLR is highly variable, further emphasizing the importance of spatial scale in SLR assessments and the need to supplement regional projections with local insights. To date, local insights are best acquired through finescale SLR assessments conducted for individual wetland sites. This is exemplified by the work of Thorne et al. (2016 Thorne et al. ( , 2018 for several wetland sites in southern California including Upper Newport Bay, Mugu Lagoon, and Tijuana River Estuary. Detailed field collections of physical and biological data were used to parameterize the processbased WARMER model (Swanson et al., 2014) to predict SLR response for a subset area within the study sites. Our SLR response predictions corroborate their overall finding that these sites will experience conversion of mid and high marsh to low marsh with modest SLR projections (0.44 m) and gains of intertidal mudflat and subtidal habitat at the expense of vegetated marsh with high SLR projections (1.66 m) (Thorne et al., 2016) . Specifically, projections for Upper Newport Bay by Thorne et al. (2016) indicate that 60% of the wetland area will be converted to subtidal with 1.66 m SLR, and this study estimates a total of 57% subtidal under the same SLR scenario. Mugu Lagoon is estimated to become 100% intertidal mudflat with 1.66 m SLR (Thorne et al., 2016) , whereas we predict the future habitat composition to be 50% intertidal mudflat and 25%\nsubtidal. However, our Mugu wetland boundary is larger than the area studied by Thorne et al. (2016) and includes more subtidal areas. Thorne et al. (2016) predict that a portion of the Tijuana River\nEstuary will convert to 80% mudflat and 20% subtidal, and we predict that a larger area of the estuary containing a higher initial proportion of vegetated marsh will consist of 32% mudflat and 24% subtidal with high SLR. Similarities in SLR response predictions for these three sites indicate that our approach may provide an alternative option when time and resource intensive assessments are not possible for individual wetlands or when regional efforts need to identify sites where more work should be targeted.\nAccommodating all wetlands types regardless of data availability is another essential step toward a comprehensive assessment of\nRelationship between predicted percent difference in wetland habitat with 1.7 m SLR by 2100 and existing (2016) (Figure 7 ). The availability of in situ accretion measurements determines the relationship between wetland habitat composition and wetland loss, where sites with higher estimates of accretion supported by empirical data appear to be less at risk for future habitat loss. Our model is sensitive to the accretion parameter, and our literature review of regional accretion rates highlights that more work is needed to characterize accretion variability across marsh zones and among archetypes.\nLike many SLR impact assessments, a lack of data adds to the uncertainty of our estimates of SLR-driven habitat change. Our results indicate that efforts should be targeted toward providing additional, spatially explicit estimates of accretion, perhaps supplied by a coordinated regional or global sampling network (Osland et al., 2017; Webb et al., 2013) . Such information would improve data gaps involving plant-mediated biogeomorphic feedbacks, especially considering that these processes are variable between individual wetlands and archetypes (Webb et al., 2013) and serve as broad indicators of vulnerability (Ganju et al., 2017) . Although data limitations made it difficult to detect significant differences in accretion between archetypes, the archetype framework represents meaningful physical and ecological differences that will likely become more significant in the future with the support of additional empirical data.\nThe mouth dynamics model component also represents an important, yet highly uncertain, hydrodynamic aspect of modeling SLR response (Rodr\u00edguez, Saco, Sandi, Saintilan, & Riccardi, 2017) . As evidenced by the previous lack of understanding on the distribution of intermediate estuaries (McSweeney et al., 2017) and the complexity of modeling such systems, data availability represents a major hurdle to modeling SLR impacts in certain wetland types and regions worldwide. Furthermore, advances in SLR projections and elevation datasets that reduce uncertainty and error would be beneficial to modeling SLR response, given the high model sensitivity to SLR rate and starting elevation.\nThis assessment is designed to inform comprehensive coastal planning by providing insights at a variety of spatial scales to aid both regional efforts and local management. Consistent, large-scale methods are critical for informing regional planning and prioritization, whereas detailed methods can then be used to help inform sitespecific designs (Runting, Wilson, & Rhodes, 2013) . Our approach augments existing SLR response assessments by estimating both the risk to individual wetlands and the relative SLR response within a region. Our findings are comparable to both large-scale assessments and intensive, site-based models, making it a useful tool for coastal management. Multiscale inferences to SLR impacts can also aid coordinated regional efforts in maintaining regional wetland composition by indicating which subregions, archetypes, or individual sites have a higher relative vulnerability to SLR (Stralberg et al., 2011) . Failure to include all relevant coastal wetland types can produce an incomplete picture of regional vulnerability and can obscure differences in archetype response to SLR. This is exemplified by intermediate estu-\naries which are globally important wetland types and require additional management considerations when planning for SLR impacts.\nOur approach can also be used to investigate how alternative management strategies could reduce SLR-driven habitat loss by manipulating model inputs (see SCWRP, 2018 for more details). For example, expanding hypsometric curves to include suitable upland habitat adjacent to a given site can reveal reductions in habitat loss associated with facilitating wetland migration. Raising the starting elevation of hypsometric curves could indicate the potential of thinlayer sediment augmentation as an adaptation strategy. Furthermore, modifying accretion rates can help set sediment management goals required to maintain current wetland habitat composition within a site or across the region. Overall, this approach is suitable for management applications in other regions given its ability to accommodate a diversity of wetland types and varying levels of data availability.
