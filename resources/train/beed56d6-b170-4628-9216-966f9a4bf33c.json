The HSLS:09 project focuses on understanding students' trajectories from the beginning of high school into higher education and the workforce. The core research questions for the study explore secondary to postsecondary transition plans and the evolution of those plans; the paths into and out of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields of study and careers; and the educational and social experiences that are related to these shifts in plans or paths. While the core research questions for HSLS:09 are longitudinal in nature, the base year, by itself, supplies valuable cross-sectional data about the nation's ninth-graders. For example, the base-year study provides data about the mathematics achievement of ninth-graders and how their achievement varies by such factors as students' educational and career expectations, course enrollment, relationships with their parents and peers, and other characteristics. Contextual sources contribute to the cross-sectional profile of ninth-graders, with their school administrators and school counselors contributing data about school organization and programs, while their mathematics and science teachers report on their professional background and instructional practices. Finally, parent data situate the ninth-grader in a family context at the point of transition to high school. The purpose of this First Look report is to introduce new National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) survey data through the presentation of selected descriptive information. Because this report is purely descriptive in nature, readers are cautioned not to draw causal inferences based on the bivariate results presented in it. It is important to note that many of the variables examined in this report may be related to one another, and complex interactions and relationships among the variables have not been explored. The variables examined here are also just a few of those that can be examined in these data; they were selected to demonstrate the range of information available from the study. These findings are examples of estimates that can be obtained from the data and are not designed to emphasize any particular issue. The release of this report is intended to encourage more in-depth analysis of the data using more sophisticated statistical methods. With that in mind, this report highlights a few results of the mathematics assessment and student beliefs, expectations, exposure to different mathematics and science courses, educational expectations, and career planning. Comparisons made in the text were tested for statistical significance to ensure that the differences were larger than might be expected as a result of sampling variation. All differences reported are significant at the p < .05 level. There were no adjustments for multiple comparisons. Estimates reported in the text that are summed across reported categories are based on the underlying unrounded estimates. Given the short format of this release report, information highlighted in the bullets does not report out all statistically significant findings from the tables. Further information about the dataset and the methodologies employed in collecting and processing the data can be found in the technical appendix to this report (appendix A) and, with greater detail, in the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (DFD) (NCES 2011-328), available from the NCES website located at http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/hsls09/. Appendix A (A.10) includes information about the variables used in each table. Chapter 1. Introduction A First Look at Fall 2009 Ninth-Graders"}, {"section_title": "Study Design", "text": "HSLS:09 is a longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample of approximately 20,000 ninthgraders in 944 schools. More specifically, the study is representative of fall term 9 th -graders in schools with a 9 th and an 11 th grade. These students will be followed through their secondary and postsecondary or early work years. The schools were sampled from public schools, including charter schools, and private schools providing instruction to both 9 th -and 11 th -grade students in the 50 United States and the District of Columbia. In 2009, fall-term ninth-graders were sampled within selected schools. All ninth-grade students in the sampled schools were classified as eligible for the study, including students with disabilities and English language learners who may not have been capable of completing the survey instruments. The base-year dataset also includes 10 individual state-representative samples of public school students and schools. More information about the sample design can be found in the technical notes (appendix A). The first follow-up of HSLS:09 will occur in the spring of 2012 when most sample members will be in the 11 th grade. A postsecondary status update will occur in the summer/fall of 2013, high school transcripts will be collected and coded in the fall of 2013/spring of 2014, and a second follow-up is planned for 2015, when most sample members will be 2 years beyond high school graduation. Additional follow-ups are planned, to at least age 26. In the base year, students completed both a questionnaire and a two-stage adaptive mathematics assessment in algebraic reasoning and problem solving. 1 Students' tested achievement in algebraic reasoning can be reported in several ways in HSLS:09. One way is to divide students into five equal groups (called quintiles or fifths), from lowest to highest in mathematics achievement. Another test score that can be reported in HSLS:09 is the probability of a student's proficiency at any one of five hierarchical levels of performance. A proficiency probability score measures how well an examinee performs relative to set criteria representing mastery of knowledge and skills assessed. Finally, HSLS:09 assessment reporting supplies an IRT-estimated number-right score, which puts results on a scale of 0-72. This report presents assessment data in all three of these ways. The assessment is adaptive in that a student's performance on the first stage (the \"router\") determines the difficulty level of the form (low, moderate, or high) of the second stage. The student survey and assessments were administered by computer. The unweighted and weighted school response rates were 50 percent and 56 percent, respectively. The unweighted and weighted students' response rates to the survey were 85 percent and 86 percent, and the unweighted and weighted student response rates to the assessment were 82 percent and 83 percent. The survey weights were adjusted for school-level and student-level unit nonresponse, and the data were then weighted to yield national estimates that represent all 9 th -grade students enrolled in schools in the United States that included both 9 th and 11 th grades. The results of a nonresponse bias analysis conducted for the survey to inform the nonresponse weight adjustments are presented in appendix A. Although primarily student data are reported here, the HSLS:09 dataset includes important contextual data from other sources, including school administrators, school counselors, science teachers, mathematics teachers, and parents, which are the focus of the forthcoming companion report, High School Longitudinal Study of 2009(HSLS:09): A First Look at Fall 2009Ninth-Graders' Parents, Teachers, School Counselors, and School Administrators (NCES 2011). 1 Although the student sample included students with disabilities and English language learners who were deemed not capable of completing the survey instruments, such students are not reflected in the estimates reported in tables of this report because they lack student questionnaire and assessment data."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 2. Selected Findings", "text": "Fifty-one percent of ninth-graders were non-Hispanic White, followed by Hispanic (23 percent), and non-Hispanic Black (14 percent) groups (table 1). Among ninth-graders, 39 percent expected to attain a graduate or professional degree and 22 percent said they did not know what educational level they expected to reach (table 1). Mathematics achievement varied by level of the ninth-grader's parents' highest education. For example, 24 percent of students with parents whose highest attainment was a high school diploma or GED were in the bottom quintile of the achievement distribution and 15 percent were in the highest quintile. In contrast, 5 percent of ninth-graders whose parents' highest attainment was a master's degree or higher were in the bottom quintile of mathematics achievement and 44 percent were in the top quintile. Results also varied by race/ethnicity. Some 16 percent of Asians were in the bottom two quintiles, compared to 62 percent of Blacks, 48 percent of Hispanics, and 32 percent of Whites (table 2). The lowest HSLS:09 proficiency level is Level 1, understanding of algebraic expressions, at which about 86 percent of ninth-graders demonstrated proficiency. At level 2, multiplicative and proportional thinking, 59 percent showed proficiency, and at one level higher, algebraic equivalents, 41 percent of ninth-graders demonstrated proficiency. For level 4, systems of equations, 18 percent were proficient. At level 5, linear functions, 9 percent were proficient (table 3). In addition to being nationally representative, HSLS:09 data are also representative of students who attend public schools in 10 states, including California, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington. As one example, in North Carolina, 2 Mathematics and science coursetaking varied by student, family, and school characteristics: for example, 17 percent of students in the lowest socioeconomic status (SES) approximately 88 percent of public school ninth-graders were proficient in algebraic expressions, 64 percent were proficient in multiplicative and proportional thinking, 46 percent had mastered algebraic equivalents, 22 percent had mastered systems of equations, and 11 percent were proficient in linear functions (table 4.b).\n"}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "Ninth-graders were also asked about their expectations for future educational attainment. A larger percentage of females than males indicated an expectation of obtaining a graduate or professional degree (44 percent versus 35 percent). A larger percentage of ninth-graders in the highest fifth of the socioeconomic status distribution expected to earn a graduate or professional degree compared to those in the bottom fifth (56 percent versus 27 percent). However, overall 22 percent of the cohort reported that they did not know what their highest educational attainment would be (table 7). group reported no mathematics coursetaking, compared to 6 percent of students in the highest SES group. About 10 percent of students overall were taking no mathematics courses in fall of ninth grade, and 18 percent no science course (tables 5 and 6). Ninth-graders were asked whether they believed they could complete college. About 90 percent said they probably (44 percent) or definitely (47 percent) could. A greater percentage of private school 2 There was no specific reason North Carolina was selected as an example. Any of the other nine states with state-representative samples equally could have been chosen to illustrate state-level findings. 3 Socioeconomic status (SES) is a measure of a family's relative social position.

Approximately a quarter -29 percent -were unable to identify an occupation 4 4 \"Don't know\" occupation at age 30 was an explicit response option for this questionnaire item. while nearly half -49 percent -identified an occupation and reported thinking about it a lot. A greater percentage of females than males reported having identified and thought about an occupation a lot (54 percent versus 44 percent) (table 9). A larger percentage of Black students than White students reported having identified and thought a lot about their future job (61 percent versus 48 percent).  1 Cut points for the quintile scores are based on students in public and private schools. Each quintile contains 20 percent of the distribution of public and private school students. The estimates in this table reflect public schools only (since the reporting unit is state-representative public school samples). Therefore the distribution in table 4 is not equal with 20 percent in each quintile. NOTE: Proficiency Levels. Level 1-algebraic expressions: understanding of algebraic basics including evaluating simple algebraic expressions and translating between verbal and symbolic representation of expressions. Level 2, multiplicative and proportional thinking: understanding of proportions and multiplicative situations; can solve proportional situation word problems, find the percent of a number, and identify equivalent algebraic expressions for multiplicative situations. Level 3-algebraic equivalents: can link equivalent tabular and symbolic representations of linear equations, identify equivalent lines and find the sum of variable expressions. Level 4-systems of equations: demonstrates an understanding of systems of linear equations and can solve such systems algebraically and graphically and characterize the lines (parallel, intersecting, collinear) represented by a system of linear equations. Level 5-linear functions: demonstrates an understanding of linear functions and ability to find and use slopes and intercepts of lines, and use functional notation. The algebra assessment estimated number right has a potential range of 0-72.   2 These responses may seem contradictory. These respondents expect an educational attainment level of college completion or higher, but at the same time, report not believing in their ability to finish college. Despite the possible contradiction, these responses do reflect the data for a small proportion of the respondents. Both items were asked separately, without filtering, of all student respondents. NOTE: All estimates are weighted by W1STUDENT, except for Parents' highest education, which is weighted by W1PARENT. Estimates reflect those students who were eligible and capable for the student survey and assessment.   NCES 2011-334). statistical procedures and analysis variables used in this report.

All of the studies monitor the transition of national samples of young people from the high school years to postsecondary statuses, including further education, participation in the work force, and the assumption of other adult roles. The core research questions for HSLS:09 explore secondary to postsecondary transition plans and the evolution of those plans; the paths into and out of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; and the educational and social experiences that affect these shifts. The HSLS:09 base year took place in the 2009-10 school year, with a randomly selected sample of fallterm 9 th -graders in more than 900 public and private high schools with both a 9 th and an 11 th grade. Students took a mathematics assessment and survey online. Students' parents, school administrators, and mathematics and science teachers as well as the school's lead counselor completed surveys on the phone or on the Web. The first follow-up of HSLS:09 will take place in the spring of 2012 when most sample members will be in the spring of the 11 th grade. Dropouts and transfer students will be followed, as well as those who remain in the base-year school. A postsecondary update will take place in the summer/fall of 2013, to learn about the cohort's postsecondary plans and decisions. High school transcripts will be collected in the fall of 2013/early 2014, and a second follow-up will take place in 2015, when most sample members will be 2 years beyond high school graduation. Further information on study design and purposes can be found in chapter 1 of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (DFD) (NCES 2011-328)."}, {"section_title": "A.2 Instrumentation", "text": "Base-year instrument design for HSLS:09 was guided by a conceptual framework that takes the student as the fundamental unit of analysis and attempts to identify the precursor factors, such as motivation, beliefs, and interests that may lead to academic goal-setting and decision-making. It traces the many variablesincluding perceived opportunities, barriers, and costs-that are associated with students' values and expectations and that factor into their most basic education-related choices. The study design also acknowledges the importance of social context and the interaction between students and their families, teachers, peers, and the wider community. Base-year instrument design was also guided by the desire to develop computer-assisted research instruments. The student questionnaire was, for the first time in the history of the study series, electronically administered, as was the student assessment in algebraic reasoning. The contextual questionnaires-parent, teacher, school administrator and counselor-were designed for Web selfadministration or computer-assisted telephone administration (CATI) by an interviewer. Computerization of the instruments was desired for several reasons, including its contribution to higher quality data and to the accurate assignment of second-stage forms in the mathematics assessment (a two-stage adaptive test was employed)."}, {"section_title": "Appendix A. Technical Notes and Methodology", "text": "A-4 A First Look at Fall 2009 Ninth-Graders Student Questionnaire. The content of the student questionnaire included both future locating information and substantive questions. The questionnaire elicited demographic information (for example, sex, race/ethnicity); language background; school experiences in the current and previous school year (including mathematics and science experiences and course enrollment). It also inquired into constructs such as mathematics self-efficacy and identification and high school, postsecondary, and career plans, among other topics. Parent Questionnaire. The parent questionnaire also included locating and substantive items. Substantive items covered household members and their roles and characteristics; demographic data; information on immigration status and language use; socioeconomic status (education, occupation, income); the student's educational history (including grade retention and change of schools); family interactions; parental involvement in the ninth-grader's learning; and plans and preparations for postsecondary education. Teacher (mathematics and science) Questionnaire. Teachers were selected by virtue of teaching an HSLS:09 student in science or mathematics. The teacher questionnaire collected background information about the respondent, including both demographic characteristics and educational and professional history. Mathematics and science teachers were asked to evaluate their mathematics or science department, and provide information at the classroom level. In part because of the fall timing of the survey (exposure to the student was comparatively low), teachers were not asked to supply ratings or evaluations of individual HSLS:09 students. School Administrator Questionnaire. The school questionnaire allowed for two respondents: the factual information sections (1-4) could be delegated to a knowledgeable staff member, the final section to be completed only by the principal, because its content concerned the principal's background and beliefs. The questionnaire elicited information about school characteristics; the student population; the school's teachers; course offered; and the goals, beliefs, and background of the principal. Counselor Questionnaire. The counselor questionnaire sought information about school programs and practices, especially as they related to activities to transition students into high school, student programs, and course assignments. The majority of questions inquired about staffing and practices (e.g., counselor certifications and caseloads, basis for assignment to students), resources (enrichment programs, services for struggling students, dropout prevention programs, and so on), and mathematics and science placement (placement criteria for both ninth-graders and upperclassmen in mathematics and science). Mathematics Assessment in Algebraic Reasoning. The mathematics assessment was designed to provide a measure of student achievement in algebraic reasoning at two points in time (9 th and 11 th grade). The test framework was designed to assess a cross-section of understandings representative of the major domains of algebra and the key processes of algebra. The test and item specifications describe six domains of algebraic content and four algebraic processes: \n"}, {"section_title": "A.3 Sample Design", "text": "In the base-year survey of HSLS:09, students were sampled through a two-stage process. First, stratified random sampling and school recruitment resulted in the identification and contacting of 1,889 eligible schools. A total of 944 of these schools participated in the study, resulting in a 56 percent (weighted) or 50 percent unweighted school response rate. 1 In the second stage of sampling, students were randomly sampled from school enrollment rosters, with 25,206 eligible selections (or about 27 students per school). All students who met the target population definition were deemed eligible for the study. However, not all students were capable of completing a questionnaire or assessment. Students who, due to language barriers or severe disabilities, were judged by their schools to be unable to participate directly in the study were retained in the sample and contextual data were sought for them. However, they lack student survey and assessment data. Their ability to complete the study instruments will be reassessed in the first follow-up. Of the 25,206 eligible students, 24,658 students were classified as questionnaire-capable and 548 as questionnaire-incapable. The target population at the school level was defined as regular public schools, including public charter schools, and private schools, in the 50 United States and the District of Columbia, providing instruction in both 9 th and 11 th grade. The target population of students was defined to include all ninth-grade students who attended the study-eligible schools in the fall 2009 term. HSLS:09 school and student samples are nationally representative, and also state-representative for a subset of 10 states. For most purposes, the student is the unit of analysis. Data at the school, classroom, or home level may be attached to the student record as contextual data. Several contextual respondent populations were sampled. The school's head administrator comprises one such respondent group. The lead counselor (or most knowledgeable about the entering ninth-grade class) was identified (with the help of the school), and used as a source of school-level student contextual data. Mathematics and science teachers of HSLS:09 ninth-graders enrolled in the subject were asked to complete a teacher questionnaire. The final source of contextual data was the parent. The parent was self-selected, using the criterion that the responding parent should be the one most knowledgeable about the ninth-grader's current experiences."}, {"section_title": "A.4 Results of School Recruitment and Data Collection", "text": "Table A-1 below summarizes the results of school recruitment and instrument completion by each component. 1 The HSLS09 base year school cooperation rates are lower than the cooperation rates obtained in the prior NCES secondary longitudinal studies. For example, the immediate predecessor study, ELS:2002, obtained in its spring 2002 base year survey, a school cooperation rate of 62 percent (unweighted) or 68 percent (weighted). Further detail on school recruitment challenges is provided in chapter 4 of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (NCES 2011-328)."}, {"section_title": "A-6", "text": "A First Look at Fall 2009 Ninth-Graders Weighted estimates use the school base weight. 2 Weighted estimates use the student base weight. 3 Among questionnaire-capable students (n = 24,658), some 21,444 completed the student questionnaire, and 20,781 completed the mathematics assessment. Thus 87.0 percent (unweighted) completed the student interview or 87.4 percent weighted. Likewise, 84.3 percent (unweighted) completed a mathematics assessment or 84.7 percent weighted. 4 Weighted estimates use the student base weight. Results reflect students who were enrolled in a mathematics course. 5 Weighted estimates use the student base weight. Results reflect students who were enrolled in a science course. Overall, about half the eligible selected schools participated, for a realized sample of 944 schools (56 percent weighted response rate). More than 21,000 students participated, or about 86 percent (weighted) of eligible selected fall ninth-graders (table A-1). While school cooperation rates were relatively low, important information about nonresponding schools was available from the sampling frame, and, in most instances, also from a special nonresponding school questionnaire. This facilitated the identification of bias, and of weighting adjustments designed to reduce or eliminate nonresponse bias for data elements known for both responding and nonresponding schools. Nonresponse bias analyses were conducted to determine whether unit nonresponse from any of the six interview data sources (school administrator and school counselor, student, parent/guardian, mathematics teacher, and science teacher) significantly increased the estimated bias for a set of population estimates. Weighted response rates for mathematics and science teachers as well as parents of the sampled students fell below 85 percent and thus, per NCES standards, were subjected to the bias analysis procedures. The remaining sources were also included for a complete evaluation of HSLS:09. Characteristics associated with the school (e.g., school sector, percent minority) and with the sampled student (e.g., race/ethnicity, sex) were used in the bias tests. Table A-2 contains a summary of the findings for the data components included in this report before and after the base weights were adjusted for nonresponse. For example, among the 60 tests conducted for student data, 18 percent were identified as having a significant level of bias before the weights were adjusted. This amount falls to almost zero once the weights were adjusted. The proportion of significant bias tests was largest for the school analytic weights (20 percent); however, the median absolute relative bias was reduced by more than 6 percentage points. Overall the unit nonresponse bias analysis detected bias in a limited number of estimates generated with the nonresponse adjusted student weights, home-life weights, and mathematics enrollee weights (0 percent, 2 percent, and 2 percent, respectively) (see table A-2). Non-negligible biases were linked to the school and science enrollee weights and were primarily due to domains with relatively small sample sizes. Specific variables used in the unit nonresponse bias analyses were school sector; ninth-grade enrollment (Asian, Black, Hispanic, Other); whether a charter school; total and ninth-grade enrollment; number of full-time teachers; student-to-teacher ratio; Census region; school locale (urbanicity); grade span; whether school has a religious affiliation; whether school is a regular secondary; and for the student-based tables, student sex and race. Bias was more an after-adjustment problem for school and science weights than for student, home-life or mathematics course enrollee weights. Using the relative bias estimate (in which bias is expressed on a uniform scale across items) as the criterion, the school weight variables and the science enrollee weight variables with the highest remaining (post-adjustment) bias and were \"no religious affiliation\"; \"school is regular secondary: no\"; and \"student-teacher ratio > 25\". The analysis procedure for evaluating nonresponse bias can be found in chapter 6, section 6.7, of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (DFD) (NCES 2011-328). Tabular results for the unit nonresponse bias analysis are presented in appendix H, section H.1, of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (DFD) (NCES 2011-328). These tables show unit nonresponse bias both before and after weighting adjustments. See  Of the students participating, approximately 98 percent were surveyed in in-school sessions, and 2 percent outside school. In-school sessions were 90 minutes in length, with 15 minutes for instructions and setup, 35 minutes for the student questionnaire, and 40 minutes for the two-part 40-question adaptive algebraic reasoning assessment. Out-of-school survey administrations did not include the assessment. Interview time for the out-of-school administration averaged 42 minutes. Parent and school staff surveys (administrator, counselor, mathematics teacher, science teacher) were designed for computerized administration in either of two modes-web-based self-administration, or CATI (computerized self-administration)."}, {"section_title": "A.5 Weighting", "text": "Analytic weights are used in combination with software that accounts for HSLS:09 complex survey design to produce estimates for the target population, with appropriate standard errors. Five sets of analytic weights were computed for HSLS:09: a school-level weight, a student-level weight, two studentlevel weights associated with contextual data from science and mathematics courses, and a student-level weight for use with parent-supplied family and home contextual data. The school-level weight can be used for school-level analyses involving the school administrator and counselor questionnaires. The student-level weight is used with student-level analyses. Because of the comparatively low unit response rates for parents and teachers, three special student weights-adjusted for parent, mathematics teacher, and science teacher nonresponse, respectively-were also produced. These weights presuppose that parents and teachers provide contextual data for participating students, and that the student is the unit of analysis. Variance estimation is provided through two means: BRR (Balanced Repeated Replication) provided on both public-and restricted-use files and a Taylor series linearization (available on the restricted use file). The BRR approach to calculating HSLS:09 standard errors is recommended, although both methods give similar results."}, {"section_title": "A.6 Imputation", "text": "Imputation of values for missing items is also an important feature of the HSLS:09 data set. Despite the best efforts of data collectors, some questionnaire items remain unanswered. Completeness of some key student variables in HSLS:09 was also adversely affected by unit nonresponse at the parent level (for example, family income, parental educational attainment, and occupation, all critical components of the socioeconomic status [SES] index), or, more rarely, the failure of questionnaire completers to complete an assessment. Imputation addresses the problem of missing items. Advantages of using imputed values include the ability to use all study respondent records in an analysis (complete-case analysis) which affords more power for statistical tests. Additionally, if the imputation procedure is effective (i.e., the imputed value is equal to [or close to] the true value) then the analysis results are likely less biased than those produced with the incomplete data file. HSLS:09 variables in general did not suffer from high levels of item nonresponse. Nevertheless, a set of key analytic variables was identified for item imputation to facilitate complete-case analysis on data obtained from the participating ninth-grade students. Values were assigned in place of missing responses for 18 variables identified from the student and parent questionnaires through single-value imputation. Missing student ability estimates in mathematics (theta), the associated standard error of measurement (sem) for the theta, and socioeconomic status (SES) values derived from parent responses were replaced with five values using a multiple imputation procedure. Regardless of the method, indicator variables (flags) were created to allow users to easily identify the imputed values. For further information on the HSLS:09 base year imputations, see the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (DFD) (NCES 2011-328) available on the HSLS:09 page of the NCES website: nces.ed.gov/surveys/hsls09."}, {"section_title": "A.7 Disclosure Risk Analysis and Protections", "text": "The disclosure treatment methods used to produce the HSLS:09 base-year data files include variable recoding, suppressing, and swapping. Some variables that had values with extremely low frequencies were recoded to ensure that the recoded values occurred with a reasonable frequency. Other variables were recoded from continuous to categorical values. Thus, rare events or characteristics have been masked for certain variables. The scores used to describe students' performance on the mathematics assessment are based on Item Response Theory (IRT). The IRT model uses patterns of correct, incorrect, and omitted responses to obtain ability estimates that are comparable across the low-, moderate-, and high-difficulty test forms. Specifically, the IRT three-parameter logistic (3PL) model was used to calibrate the test items and estimate a student's ability. The 3PL model is a mathematical model for estimating the probability that a person will respond correctly to an item. This probability is given as a function of one parameter characterizing the proficiency of a given student and three parameters characterizing the properties of a given item-the item's difficulty, discriminating ability, and a guessing factor. The IRT model accounts for the three characteristics of each test question in estimating a student's ability. Scores on the HSLS:09 mathematics assessment are represented in three ways in this report: as membership in one of five quintiles based on the weighted distribution of all scores; as an estimatednumber correct score; and as a probability of proficiency in five discrete levels of algebraic content."}, {"section_title": "Quintiles", "text": "The mathematics quintile membership is a norm-referenced measure of achievement. The quintile measure divides the weighted (population estimate) achievement distributions into five equal groups based on the mathematics standardized scores (see next paragraph). Quintile 1 corresponds to the lowest achieving one-fifth of the population, quintile 5 the highest. To determine the quintile cut-points, the weighted distribution of the standardized scores was divided at the 20th, 40th, 60th, and 80th percentiles. Cut-points were matched to unrounded standardized scores. For this report, the middle three quintiles were combined to form one category."}, {"section_title": "Proficiency Levels", "text": "The mathematics proficiency probability scores are criterion-referenced and are based on clusters of items that mark five levels on the mathematics scale developed in HSLS: 09.

The five levels are the following: Level 1: algebraic expressions. Students able to answer questions like these have an understanding of algebraic basics including evaluating simple algebraic expressions and translating between verbal and symbolic representations of expressions. Level 2: multiplicative and proportional thinking. Students able to answer questions like these have an understanding of proportions and multiplicative situations and can solve proportional situation word problems, find the percent of a number, and identify equivalent algebraic expressions for multiplicative situations. Level 3: algebraic equivalents. Students able to answer questions like these have an understanding of algebraic equivalents and can link equivalent tabular and symbolic representations of linear equations, identify equivalent lines, and find the sum of variable expressions. Level 4: systems of equations. Students able to answer questions like these have an understanding of systems of linear equations and can solve such systems algebraically and graphically and characterize the lines (parallel, intersecting, collinear) represented by a system of linear equations. Level 5: linear functions. Students able to answer questions like these have an understanding of linear functions and can find and use slopes and intercepts of lines, and use functional notation. Although clusters of four items anchor each mastery level, the probability of proficiency is a continuous score that does not depend on a student answering the actual items in each of the clusters but rather on the probability of a correct answer on these items given the overall pattern of response on the items completed."}, {"section_title": "Estimated-Number Correct", "text": "The mathematics IRT-estimated number-correct score is a criterion-referenced measure of achievement. The criterion is the set of skills defined by the HSLS: 2009 framework and represented by the 72 items in the HSLS: 2009 mathematics item pool. The estimated number-correct score for mathematics indicates the number of items students would have answered correctly had they responded to all 72 items in the item pool.
