[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The U.S. dairy industry has seen major restructuring in the last few decades. The number of U.S. dairy farms has declined from 648,000 in 1970 to 53,127 in 2010, a 92% decline (Progressive Dairyman 2011). The decline has been concentrated among smaller farms. For example, the number of farms with less than 100 cows decreased by over 65% between 1993 and 2011. In the meantime, average dairy herd size increased from 19 cows in 1970 to 172 in 2010. Milk yield per cow doubled over the same period (Progressive Dairyman 2012; USDA NASS). Smaller farms also generally have lower per cow yields and technical efficiency. The USDA Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) 2010 estimated a yield of about 15,600 lb. milk /cow in herds of size smaller than 50 cows and a yield of about 21,400 lb. milk /cow in herds of size 200+, i.e., the larger herds produce 7 lb. milk /cow for every 5 lb. milk /cow produced by smaller herds. Dairy industry structure is of significant policy concern for a variety of reasons. The diminishing number of dairy farms has had consequences for economic vitality in some rural areas. There are geographic patterns in exits: over the past two decades smaller dairy farms in more traditional dairying areas have closed down and larger farms in the Western states have opened up. Larger herds are generally more confined in production format, raising policy issues that include waste disposal and animal welfare, while scale may also bring benefits and costs to do with public animal health management. Larger farms have been associated with better milk quality (Norman et al. 2011), of relevance to international market competitiveness because export market dairy quality regulations have become more stringent in recent years. Herd size, exit and technical efficiency are related in varied ways. Much farm-level production structure is cheaper to build in large scale while asset use (e.g., milking facilities, feed storage, information and recording infrastructure, animal health plans) can be more efficient on larger facilities. It is not surprising then to learn that economies of scale are large in modern production facilities (Mosheim and Knox Lovell 2009), motivating a link between larger herd size and levels of profitability that would support continued production. Efficiency should also affect one's intention to continue production in that the more productive operations are better motivated and likely financially better positioned to continue. In fact, researchers have suggested that efficiency is one of the key factors for the survival of dairy farms (Tauer and Belbase 1987;Tauer 2001;Alvarez et al. 2008). These incentives have been explored in relation to hog production contracts by Dong, Hennessy and Jensen (2010), but have not been studied for dairy production. The three decisions are likely interrelated and should be investigated in an integrated, systemic manner that accounts for endogeneity. The objective of this study is two-fold. The first is to investigate what factors affect farms' technical efficiency. We first utilize a stochastic production frontier (SPF) to estimate farms' technical efficiency. Although many studies have estimated dairy farms' technical efficiency using stochastic frontier analysis, there is a severe endogeneity issue in the production function set up. We adopt a different way to construct the production function in the SFA to lessen the endogeneity problem. We examine empirically what factors affect a farm's technical efficiency. We then incorporate these findings into our second objective, which is to explore how herd size and technical efficiency affect the dairy farms' exit decision and how technical efficiency affects farms' herd size. We set up a system of equations to fulfill the two objectives."}, {"section_title": "Data and Methodology", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Stochastic Production Frontier", "text": "To analyze interactions among herd size, efficiency, and exit decision, we start with an estimation of dairy farm technical efficiency. Kumbhakar and Lovell (2000) suggest that a stochastic frontier model is generally the most appropriate approach in agricultural production studies because of its ability to deal with stochastic noise and inclusion of categorical variables in the characterization of technology (Mayen, Balagtas, and Alexander 2009). The stochastic production frontier model was first developed by Aigner, Lovell, and Schmidt (1977). Consider a production function ln , where y i is output for farm i, i x is a vector of inputs including a column of ones, \uf062 is the corresponding vector of parameters and i \uf065 is an error term. Error term i \uf065 is comprised of two independent components  Here it is assumed that i v follows the half normal distribution so that i u can be obtained from the conditional mean (Jondrow et al. 1982 seek more profit instead of more milk and adjust their feed and labor inputs according to input prices. Under such a price dependent production technology, the parameters for feed and labor input quantity in the milk production function may capture adjustments that confound the ability to make direct comparisons of efficiency across farms, such as changes in input use due to differing input prices. Therefore, we use feed and labor prices instead in the SPF equation. We also include capital cost and other costs as well as technology factors in the SPF equation, which are explained in detail later."}, {"section_title": "Models for Exit, Size, and Efficiency Analysis", "text": "To empirically investigate interrelations among exit, size, and productivity in dairy operations, a three-equation system with 'Exit', efficiency, and herd size as the dependent variables is set up as follows: Herd Size: ; : ; where the \uf061 , \uf062 and \uf067 parameters are to be estimated; the i \uf065 are random error terms, We set up the model such that farm's technical efficiency and herd size affect the farm's exit decision, but not vice versa. This is because even if a farm intends to exit, it may still try to remain as efficient as possible. And the farm exit decision is a relatively long-run decision which may not affect the farm's herd size in the short run. The system of equation in (5) is a recursive mixed-process model with endogenous variables appearing on the right-hand sides as fully observed. Therefore, ML SUR can get consistent estimates (Roodman 2009). The likelihood function for a recursive fully observed model can be written as (Roodman 2009): is the probability distribution function for i \uf065\uf025 , and Here, for a multinomial probit equation,  T are lower and upper truncation points, respectively. If the model is not truncated, then the denominator is 1 (Roodman 2009). In addition, \uf071 is defined as follows: where \uf044 is a strictly upper triangular matrix with both the diagonal and the lower triangle 0's."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "Data used in this study are from the USDA's 2010 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) Dairy Costs and Returns Report, which is administered jointly by the Economic Research Service (ERS) and National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). The survey collects information on dairy farm production practices and management, input use, facilities, farm financial characteristics, and demographic information on farm operators and their households. The 2010 survey data have 1,915 responses from 26 states. We focus on conventional dairy farming as the technology between organic and conventional dairy system is different (Mayen, Balagtas, and Alexander 2009), which gives us 1,332 observations. Two observations with unreasonable values for price of feed that are over $5000/unit are deleted, leaving us 1,330 observations in total. Variables used in the models are presented in Table 1, and summary data for the survey population estimates are presented in  1996) and was also provided by NASS for each dairy operation in the data. Capital includes the ownership costs of the investment on buildings and machinery devoted to dairy production (Mayen, Balagtas, and Alexander 2009). In the SPF equation, besides feed, labor, and capital inputs, we also include variables on technology and cow breed, which are likely to substantially affect milk yield. Bovine somatotropin (bST) is a bovine growth hormone that can be used as a supplement to help cows prolong and increase the level of milk production. The use of bST can increase productivity without increasing other inputs and thus improves the farm's technical efficiency. The variable bST denotes the percentage of milking herd receiving bST during the year. Holstein-Friesian cows are a breed of dairy cattle that are known as the highest-production dairy animals. Comparing to other breeds, Holstein-Friesian cows can produce more milk using same amount of inputs and consequently increase farm's efficiency. We use a variable Holstein to denote the percentage of Holstein-Friesian cows in the milking herd on the farm. Pasture-based dairy systems can reduce feed costs and increase net returns on small-to medium-sized farms when compared with conventional confinement dairy systems. However cows on pasture based systems may also have lower yield (Tranel and Frank 1991;Parker et al. 1991;Combs 2001). The dummy variable pasture25 , which takes the value 1 if milk cows obtained 25% or more total forage ration from pasture during the grazing months (Mayen, Balagtas, and Alexander 2009) was included in the SPF equation in order to account for these effects. In the three-equation system, the variable \"exit\" was generated from the survey question \"How many more years do you expect this operation will be producing hogs?\" If the answer to the question is 10 years or less, then the variable \"exit\" is assigned value 1 while it is assigned the value 0 otherwise (Dong, Hennessy, and Jensen 2010). In the exit equation, variables for how many years this operation has been producing milk (Years), if a non-operator worked for over 20 hours/week without a payment (nonoppwork=1 if it is true, 0 otherwise), farm long-term debt (more than one year debt) per cow (longdebt), if the operator has a college degree (college), operator's age (age), and location (location2-location8) are included as explanatory variables. We use the unpaid non-operator work as an indicator for whether there is successor in the farm. In addition technical efficiency (TE) which is calculated from the SPF equation, and herd size (cows) are also included in the \"exit\" equation. included. These concern use of regular veterinary services (Vetservice), use of a nutritionist to design mixes or purchase feed (nutritionist), and use of a computerized feed delivery system (feeddelivery) are included to explain the variation in TE."}, {"section_title": "Estimation and Results", "text": "The ARMS data were developed from a complex survey design including stratification, clustering, dual frames, and unequal probability sampling (NRC, 2008). To generate population estimates, survey weights provided by the data set were used to represent dairy operations in 26 states and incorporated in the estimation. The SPF was estimated as a half-normal production model; maximum likelihood estimation results are listed in Table 3. Both feed and labor prices decrease milk productivity. This implies that more expensive feed and labor may reduce those inputs and thus results in lower productivity. However, only labor price is statistically significant. Capital and other inputs also increase productivity. As expected, pasture25 decreases milk productivity as extensive pasture-based farming has lower feed efficiency when compared with confined dairy farming. This result is consistent with findings by Cabrera, Solis and del Corral (2010). bST and Holstein also have expected positive signs. Compared to farms in the Heartland, farms in the Fruitful Rim (except FL and GA) have higher milk yield, while farms in Eastern Uplands and Southern Seaboard (including farms in FL and GA in the  (2009). The estimation results are listed in Table 4."}, {"section_title": "Exit", "text": "The results on exit indicate that more efficient farms are less likely to exit as higher efficiency increases farm's competitive performance and enables farm to survive. Larger farms are also less likely to exit, suggesting that there may be significant economies of scale in large farms which help those farms reduce average production cost. As Macdonald et al. (2007) pointed out, the cost penalty from small scale affects the survival of small operations that are not able to realize minimum efficient scale. Farms having more long-term debt are less likely to exit. As generally long-term debts are for investment to expand or upgrade the operation, such farms have long-term goals to reach and are unlikely to plan to exit. Farms that have been producing milk for more years and older farmers are more likely to exit in 10 years. It is reasonable considering outdated farms and older farmers. Operators with a college degree are also more likely to exit when compared to those without a college degree. Operators with a college degree may have more chances to get an off-farm job after they exit the farm business. If an unpaid non-operator worked over half-time at the operation, then the farm is less likely to exit. This variable indicates the possibility that the non-operator who was working mainly at the operation is likely to inherit or take-over the operation and continue the business. Location also plays a role. When compared with the Heartland region, farms in the Northern Crescent, East Upland, and Southern Seaboard regions are less likely to exit while farms located in 'Rest' are more likely to exit."}, {"section_title": "Size", "text": "In the size equation, the estimation suggests that more efficient farms tend to have more cows. More efficient farms are more competitive and thus are more likely to expand. If a farm has more land, it also has more cows. Land is an important factor affecting farm expansion, although the confinement dairy system has made the land requirement less important than before. If the operator works off farm for over half time or the operator is older, then the farm has fewer cows. This result suggests that dairy farming was not a focus of those operators. When compared with the Heartland region, farm sizes in the Northern  MacDonald et al. (2007)."}, {"section_title": "Technical Efficiency", "text": "In the TE equation, operator's college education helps the operation have higher efficiency. Moreover, farms using regular scheduled veterinary services, a nutritionist to design mixes or purchase feed, and a computerized feed delivery system have higher technical efficiency. As generally only large size farms utilize such services, this result indirectly explains why large farms are more technical efficient. Farms with older operators are less technically efficient than those with younger operators."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In this study, we conducted an analysis of interactions among dairy farm size, efficiency, and exit decisions. We first estimated technical efficiency from a stochastic production frontier which is then incorporated into a system of equations along with farm's exit decision and farm size. While those three factors are generally interrelated, to our best knowledge, there have been no previous studies that analyze them in an integrated and systemic manner. The system is estimated using maximum likelihood method. Estimations from the system equations suggest how herd size and farm productivity affect farms' exit decisions and how farms' technical efficiency affects farms' herd size. Results from the estimated system of equations show that some farms choose to exit while others make commitments to stay in operation. As more small and inefficient farms exit, the structure of the dairy sector is going to be dominated by large and efficient dairy operations. Having unpaid, non-operator labor signals the presence of a successor and commitment to enterprise development. The presence of greater long-term debt indicates that the farm has made more long term investment, a commitment that may indicate plans to expand in the future. In addition, more efficient farms tend to expand. The results imply that current trends toward larger and more efficient dairy farms would continue. In addition, efficient farms are larger farms, an aspect that reinforces the effects of size on exit for small farms. Although the continued shift to large efficient dairy operations can benefit consumers through lower dairy prices, environmental impacts associated with manure management and the effects of rural communities with fewer family farms will need to be addressed by policymakers.
