[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Earth's ecosystems are increasingly threatened by multiple stressors related to human activities (Ripple et al., 2017). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has recently warned about the specific threat of CO2 release and consequent increasing temperatures (Allen et al., in press). This acceleration in global warming has highlighted the need for improved climate projections by examining historical instrument data and reconstructing paleoclimate records from natural archives. Paleoclimate reconstructions can help to overcome the absence of long and continuous instrumental climate records that are needed to evaluate the likely impacts and consequences of climate change and global warming on the environment and ecosystem. It is therefore crucial to develop effective climate proxies to obtain better paleoclimate reconstructions. A number of proxies have been developed to evaluate temperatures in the upper ocean system, which include faunal assemblages (e.g. Mix et al., 1999), alkenones in sediments (e.g. Muller et al., 1998), Mg/Ca (e.g. Dekens et al., 2002) and \u03b4 18 O (e.g. Bemis et al., 1998) in planktonic foraminifera, Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca in tropical corals (e.g. Correge, 2006;Mitsuguchi et al., 1996), and more recently clumped isotopes (Ghosh et al., 2006). However, relatively few proxies have been developed for deep/cold water environments (Montagna et al., 2014). In general, the effectiveness of geochemical proxies can be compromised by complications induced mainly by the physiology of the organism, and diagenetic processes. The Li/Mg ratio in aragonite foraminifera and corals was established as a proxy to reconstruct seawater temperatures (Bryan and Marchitto, 2008;Case et al., 2010;Raddatz et al., 2013;Montagna et al., 2014). Its use gained support as it was considered to be only moderately affected by coral physiology or by fine-scale skeletal variations (e.g. centres of calcification vs. fibrous aragonite), and hence largely independent of species controls, so it could be applied across a wide range of environments and species. A general exponential calibration curve showed a direct relationship between coral Li/Mg ratios and ambient seawater temperature, for both cold-water and tropical corals across a temperature range of 0.75-28 \u00b0C, with an uncertainty in the Li/Mg-derived temperature of \u00b1 0.9 \u00b0C (Hathorne et al., 2013;Montagna et al., 2014). However, some uncertainties remain, such as the mechanisms of Li and Mg incorporation in the skeleton during the bio-mineralization process, the microstructure-related Li/Mg variations, and the mechanisms explaining the ultimate link with temperature (Montagna et al., 2014;Rollion-Bard and Blamart, 2015;Marchitto et al., 2018). More recently, advantages of a multi-proxy approach combining Li/Mg and Sr/Ca have provided more accurate temperature reconstructions by reducing apparent species effects (Fowell et al., 2016;D'Olivo et al., 2018;Zinke et al., 2019). The present study aims to resolve some of the uncertainties that can affect the reliability of Li/Mg as a temperature proxy in corals. In particular, we discuss the effects of organic matter in the coral skeleton, which is known to alter the coral geochemistry and hence bias climate reconstructions (Boiseau and Juillet-Leclerc, 1997;Mitsuguchi et al., 2001;Watanabe et al., 2001;Barker et al., 2003;Holcomb et al., 2015). Organic matter found in corals may have various origins, including the polyp-derived skeletal organic matrix that is believed to act as a template for initial crystal nucleation (e.g. Cuif et al., 2008;Mass et al., 2013;Takeuchi et al., 2016), the organic membranes of the living polyps, the deposition of bacteria or algal symbionts rich in chlorophyll, and seawater-sourced organic matter entrapped in the coral skeleton (DeCarlo et al., 2018). Although the effect of organic matter on geochemical proxies, such as Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, \u03b4 18 O and \u03b4 11 B, is relatively well-documented (Mitsuguchi et al., 2001;Watanabe et al., 2001), little is known about its effect on the Li/Ca and Li/Mg ratios (Holcomb et al., 2015). Finally, we discuss the purity of the skeletal aragonite mineralogy, including calcite contamination as a factor influencing the fidelity of the Li/Mg proxy. The calibration curve of Montagna et al. (2014) is expanded here to include extreme temperatures using new Li/Mg data, from both laser and solution-based ICP-MS analyses of corals from sub-zero temperature waters in Antarctica. We also further evaluate the general link existing between coral Li/Mg and Sr/Ca ratios and the ambient seawater temperature, and the validity of using Li/Mg and Sr/Ca multiregressions to reduce uncertainties on reconstructed temperatures (Fowell et al., 2016;D'Olivo et al., 2018)."}, {"section_title": "Samples and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Coral samples", "text": "We investigated 64 scleractinian corals, both zooxanthellate (n=47) and non-zooxanthellate (n=17), collected live from the Mediterranean Sea, Caribbean Sea, Pacific Ocean, and Ross Sea, from waters spanning a wide range in temperature (\u22121 to 29.5 \u00b0C), salinity (34.71 to 38.61), and depth (3 to 670 m) (Table 1, Fig. 1). We examined 11 different species of 8 different genera: Porites spp., Orbicella faveolata, Orbicella annularis, Pseudodiploria strigosa, Madrepora oculata, Javania antarctica, Flabellum impensum, Flabellum gardineri, Caryophyllia antarctica, and Paraconotrochus antarcticus (Table 1). Seawater temperature data at the sampling locations were obtained from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature version 2 (AVHRR-OISSTv2, 0.25\u00b0 grid;Banzon et al., 2016;Reynolds et al., 2007) for shallow-water corals, and from NOAA WOA13v2 (0.25\u00b0 grid) for specimens living below 10m depth (Boyer et al., 2013). When available, we used in situ temperature data that had been acquired using CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) profiles near the coral sampling site (Table 1). Salinity data for all the sampling locations were obtained from the NOAA WOA13v2 dataset. Seawater temperature data from the AVHRR-OISSTv2 database cover the same period corresponding to the coral portion sub-sampled for geochemistry (i.e. the last 4-6 years, see below).

These colonies were sampled at various depths, from 3m at Moorea Island down to 20m at Wallis Islands, and mean seawater temperatures, from 22.4 \u00b0C near Easter Island to 29.0 \u00b0C near Wallis Island. In November 2015, 25 short cores were extracted from Porites lobata colonies living in the lagoonal Uitoe and Dumbea Fausse passe reefs, New Caledonia, between 3 and 51 m, within a temperature range of 22.4-26.6 \u00b0C. These P. lobata colonies were exposed to different levels of sunlight irradiance, with 3 colonies (06, 08 and 28) having portions growing under conditions of variable intensity, from shady to direct sunlight, and two colonies (11.5 and 15.5) growing entirely under shady conditions. Short cores (~10 cm long) were collected in 2017 with a Nemo underwater drill system from 12 living Orbicella spp. (n=9) and P. strigosa (n=3) coral colonies growing at 5m water depth, within a few meters long transect, in Puerto Morelos Reef, northeast coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico (Fig. 1). The average SST at the sampling site was 27.9 \u00b0C, and temperatures ranged between 26.4 \u00b0C in winter and 29.3 \u00b0C in summer (Table 1). The Porites spp., Orbicella spp., and P. strigosa cores were imaged using a DISCOVERY CT750 HD computerized tomography scanner with 0.62mm resolution, to identify high and low density growth bands. Scans were conducted at Platform DOSEO, CEA-Paris-Saclay. The cores were then cut along the major growth axis with a rock saw and the skeletal portion corresponding to the last 4-6 years (2010-2016), based on density banding, was sub-sampled for trace element analysis using a fine diamond saw. In addition, skeletal aragonite was collected along the thecal wall of four O. faveolata and two P. strigosa cores using a small diamond bur, carefully avoiding extrathecal material (Table 1)."}, {"section_title": "Cold-water non-zooxanthellate corals", "text": "A small living colony of the framework-forming cold-water coral, Madrepora oculata, was collected from the Sardinia Channel (Mediterranean Sea) at 432m water depth using a Remotely Operated Vehicle on the R/V Urania during the RECORD 2014 cruise (Taviani et al., 2017). The seawater temperature was obtained from a CTD profile acquired close to the sampling location and was compared to the value sourced from the WOA13v2 dataset to obtain the long-term temperature variability (13.8 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b0C). The topmost portion of one of the branches, corresponding to ~1 year of skeletal growth (Orejas et al., 2011), was carefully cleaned using a fine diamond saw to remove any organic material residues, and sub-sampled in 6 different aliquots of ~50 mg each. The other living non-zooxanthellate corals investigated in this study were collected from the Ross Sea (Antarctica) at 389 and 670m water depth during the XVII (2002) and XXXII (2017) Antarctic campaigns aboard the R/V Italica and include 5 different species: Javania antarctica, Caryophyllia antarctica, Flabellum impensum, Flabellum gardineri and Paraconotruchus antarcticus.

The topmost portion of the skeleton of each specimen, corresponding to ~5-10 years of growth based on growth estimates (Henry and Torres, 2013;Fallon et al., 2014), was sub-sampled and carefully cleaned using a diamond dental disc. Each of the skeletal portions extracted from the zooxanthellate and non-zooxanthellate coral samples was finely crushed in an agate mortar, thoroughly mixed, and separated into two aliquots of ~50-100 mg that were transferred to acid-cleaned vials. An aliquot of each sample was cleaned through an oxidative cleaning step (Section 2.2.) before being dissolved and analysed for trace elements. The remaining aliquots of the Caribbean Sea and New Caledonia samples were rinsed with MilliQ water (18\u03a9) and dissolved in 0.5 N HNO3. The comparison between \"cleaned\" and \"uncleaned\" aliquots allowed us to evaluate the potential effects of organic contamination on the trace element compositions, and specifically on the Li/Mg temperature proxy. "}, {"section_title": "Chemical treatment", "text": "Most trace elements measured in coral skeletons commonly used as proxies for climate reconstructions are biased by the presence of organic matter embedded in the carbonate matrix, or adsorbed on the skeletal surface (Amiel et al., 1973a(Amiel et al., , 1973bAllison, 1996). In addition, high concentrations of chlorophyll, associated with the endolithic algae of the genus Ostreobium (Le Campion-Alsumard et al., 1995;Masse et al., 2018), may also affect geochemical signals. However, the impact of chlorophyll on the Li/Mg temperature proxy has not yet been quantified. In this study, different cleaning protocols were tested in order to remove Mg and Li associated with organic contamination and surface adsorption, without removing the fraction incorporated into the coral aragonite matrix (Mitsuguchi et al., 2001;Watanabe et al., 2001). The cleaning protocols were tested on two samples of O. faveolata collected live from Puerto Morelos, one characterized by green bands (2-5mm thick, mainly developed at ~1.5 cm from the surface) indicating the presence of Ostreobium algae (\"contaminated\" sample), and the other \"clean\" sample with no apparent green band was used as a control. In parallel, we applied the same cleaning protocols on an inhouse Porites standard (M1Pp) to assess the possible alteration of the initial elemental composition of the skeleton. Samples were finely crushed and split into 5 groups, each consisting of 3 subsamples of ~60 mg transferred to acidcleaned vials. All groups were cleaned with MilliQ water in an ultrasonic bath for 30s, repeated twice (protocol 1). Subsequently, groups 2, 3, 4 and 5 underwent specific chemical treatments: group 2 was cleaned with a mixture of 1% H2O2 buffered with 0.1M NH4OH (protocol 2a); group 3 with a mixture of 5% H2O2 buffered with 0.2M NH4OH (protocol 2b); group 4 with a mixture of 15% H2O2 buffered with 0.5M NH4OH (protocol 2c); and group 5 was treated with 5% NaOCl solution in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min, then rinsed with MilliQ water several times (protocol 3). During treatments, groups 2, 3 and 4 were placed in a water bath at 60 \u00b0C for 20 min and then rinsed with MilliQ several times. Between each step, vials containing the powder and the cleaning solution were centrifuged at 2320 G for 3 min and the supernatant discarded. After cleaning treatments, samples were dried at 40 \u00b0C and dissolved in 0.5 N HNO3 to obtain 100 ppm Ca solutions that were analysed by ICP-MS (Section 2.3). Based on the Li/Ca, Mg/Ca and Li/Mg results (Section 3), we decided to apply the cleaning protocol 2c to all the other samples.\nfaveolata samples from Puerto Morelos, one \"contaminated\" by organic matter rich bands (Fig. 3), and another \"clean\" without a green band used as control sample. The average Mg/ Ca ratio of the subsamples that were treated only with MilliQ water is particularly high for the sample with the green band (7.32 \u00b1 0.14 mmol/mol) compared to the control sample (4.26 \u00b1 0.01 mmol/mol), and significantly affects the Li/Mg ratio. The application of the four treatments (2a, 2b, 2c and 3) effectively reduced the Mg/Ca ratio by 20 to 35% in the \"contaminated\" sample but did not alter the skeletal composition of the M1P-p Porites standard (< 1%) and only slightly that of the \"clean\" O. faveolata specimen (< 4%) ( Table S1). The Li/Ca ratio decreased by ~7%, ~6% and < 1% in the \"contaminated\", \"clean\" and M1P-p standard, respectively. rinse; 2a: 1% H2O2 + 0.1M NH4OH ; 2b: 5% H2O2 + 0.2M NH4OH; 2c: 15% H2O2 + 0.5M NH4OH; 3: 5% NaOCl.). The contaminated sample (black dots) was characterized by a distinct green band indicating the presence of Ostreobium algae, whereas the control sample (grey dots) did not show any visible green band. Each value is the average (\u00b1 1s SD) of 3 subsamples of coral powder (see table S1). The decrease in Mg/Ca and Li/Ca ratios in the \"clean\" sample might be due to the presence of organic material residues that are not visible. The most appropriate cleaning protocol was selected based on the largest decrease in Mg/Ca ratio and the lowest inter-samples variability in the \"contaminated\" sample. Accordingly, protocol 2c, with samples treated with 15% H2O2 buffered with 0.5M NH4OH, seems the most efficient and was systematically adopted to clean all the other coral samples (Fig. 2).     (Table 2). However, three samples display larger variations (\u22652 \u00b0C).   Table S2). The influence of organic matter related to the green band on the Li/Mg-derived temperatures is clearly detectable. The cleaning protocol induces a strong decrease in Mg/Ca that leads to more realistic temperature estimates, and reduces the difference between the reconstructed and in situ temperatures (Table 2)."}, {"section_title": "Analytical methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Solution quadrupole ICP-MS", "text": "Cleaned coral samples were dissolved in 0.5 N HNO3 (Optima Fisher Ultra Trace Element Analysis, 67%) and analysed using a Quadrupole ICP-MS X-Series II at LSCE (Gif-sur-Yvette, France). 7L i, 24 Mg, 43,44 Ca, 86,87,88 Sr, and 238 U isotopes were selected to quantify their elemental concentration in the skeleton following Montagna et al. 2014.

The analyses of coral sub-samples containing the green bands show high levels of Mg/Ca, associated with relatively stable Li/Ca, leading to unusually low Li/Mg values for tropical corals (e.g. 0.59 mmol/mol for MEX 13 compared to ~1.5 mmol/mol for corals living at similar temperatures; Montagna et al., 2014), and temperatures overestimated by >15 \u00b0C (Table S2). The difference between the Li/Mg-derived temperature and the ambient seawater is mostly attributed to the Mg/Ca ratio (Fig. 7). Conversely, specimens of P. strigosa from the same environment are not affected by green bands, and the levels of Mg/Ca and Li/Mg are similar to those for Porites spp. (this study;Hathorne et al., 2013;Montagna et al., 2014;D'Olivo et al., 2018;Zinke et al., 2019) and Siderastrea siderea (Fowell et al., 2016). Once treated with the oxidative protocol, the Orbicella spp. and P. strigosa samples show a reduction in Mg/Ca by >25% and ~4%, respectively, suggesting that Mg is strongly linked to the presence of the green band. In particular, for the O. faveolata samples MEX 05 and MEX 13, which are characterized by a very distinct green band (Fig. 3), the Mg/Ca reduction was up to 36%. This value is similar to that reported for Montastrea faveolata (now O. faveolata) by Watanabe et al. (2001) who suggested that 40% of Mg can be absorbed in organic matter at the surface of the crystals. Conversely, the chemical treatment did not affect the Li/Ca content, being reduced by only 1% for both genera. This is indicative that the green band is due to the presence of chlorophyll, as the photosynthetic pigment in Ostreobium (Jeffrey, 1968) incorporates Mg in its molecular structure. In contrast, the band is not enriched in Li, which is not a chlorophyll component, leading to a significant modification of the initial skeletal Li/Mg ratio. Those results differ from Fowell et al. 2016 Table 2). The incomplete removal of organic matter in those samples strongly marked by green bands could explain this larger shift. Our protocol thus appears to be the most efficient in removing Mg associated with green bands, giving Li/Mg ratios closer to published values for tropical corals. However, reconstructed temperatures can still be up to 3 \u00b0C lower than expected for some samples (e.g. MEX 06 and MEX 15) (Table 2), which cannot be easily explained by organic-bound Mg. Part of this difference could be related to the uncertainty of the Li/Mg vs. temperature calibration (Montagna et al., 2014) at the high (tropical) temperatures, but it also reveals a potential speciesspecific effect regarding the amount of COC-like structures, which is known to be enriched in Mg and can also alter the Li/Mg ratio (Montagna et al., 2014;Rollion-Bard and Blamart, 2015). The cleaning treatment did not affect the Li/Ca, Mg/Ca and Li/Mg ratios of the P. lobata samples from New Caledonia, which is consistent with results from the cleaning test of the M1P-p Porites standard (Table S1), suggesting either that the amount of organic matter entrapped in the skeleton of this genus is much less than that present in O. faveolata, or the organic component in Porites contains little (or no) chlorophyll. Moreover, similar pre-and post-cleaning geochemical values for the New Caledonia samples confirm that our cleaning protocol did not alter the skeletal composition. These results differ somehow from those reported by Montagna et al. (2014) that showed a systematic and comparable % decrease in Li/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios after applying different cleaning steps to the JCp-1 Porites standard, all involving a weak acid treatment (i.e. 0.01 and 0.05 N HNO3). However, the Li/Mg ratio did not change between treated and untreated samples. We speculate that the decrease in Li/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios in Montagna et al. 2014   Li/Ca (\u00b5mol/mol) a diffraction (XRD) and mRaman spectroscopy to identify the presence of carbonate phases other than aragonite. XRD revealed variable amounts of calcite, from 0.9 to 16.5% (Fig. 5), while mRaman allowed precise location of the calcite at micrometer scale within the coral skeleton (Fig. 6). The presence of diagenetic calcite was previously observed in live corals, notably in Porites sp. (Lazareth et al., 2016), and is known to bias paleoclimate reconstructions from Sr/Ca or Mg/Ca ratios (McCulloch et al., 1996;McGregor and Gagan, 2003;Nothdurft et al., 2007). However, only a few studies have evaluated the impact of calcite on the Li/Mg ratio."}, {"section_title": "Effect of diagenetic calcite on the Li/Mg proxy", "text": "Lazareth et al. 2016showed that Li/Mg in a Porites in Vanuatu has a higher sensitivity to calcite compared to Sr/Ca. These biases are notably due to a considerable enrichment of Mg content in skeleton infilled by diagenetic calcite (Berner, 1975;Allison et al., 2007;Nothdurft et al., 2007;Bryan and Marchitto, 2008;Hathorne et al., 2011;Lazareth et al., 2016). XRD analysis revealed the presence of high-Mg calcite in the skeleton of samples GRC-02-015 (0.9%), GRC-02-014 (5.3%) and GRC-02-056 (16.5%), whereas this carbonate phase was below the detection limit for samples GRC-02-001 and GRC-02-002. Consequently, the Mg/ Ca in high-Mg calcite-contaminated samples is much higher than those of pristine samples, which reduces the Li/Mg ratio as previously observed for Porites sp. ( Lazareth et al., 2016). Li/Mg decreases linearly with the amount of calcite (R 2 =0.89, p-value < 0.001) ( Fig. 8c) in response to a steeper increase of Mg/Ca compared to Li/Ca (Fig. 8a, b). Sr/Ca shows a weak decrease with the amount of calcite (Fig. 8d). Mg/Ca and Li/Ca increase by 0.89 mmol/mol and 0.67 \u03bcmol/mol/% calcite respectively, leading to a decrease in Li/Mg of 0.21 mmol/mol/% calcite, which corresponds to a Li/Mg-derived temperature sensitivity of ~+1.5 \u00b0C/% calcite for the Antarctic cold-water coral samples (Fig. 9). This is much higher than the temperature sensitivity estimated for the Porites sp. in Lazareth et al. (2016) (+0.27 \u00b0C/% calcite; Fig. 9). This correction is based on the assumption that calcite is the only source of anomalous Mg and Li. By normalizing the two intercepts of Li/Ca and Mg/Ca at 0% of calcite (14.51 \u00b1 0.70 \u03bcmol/mol and 2.74 \u00b1 0.13 mmol/mol, respectively), a Li/Mg (0% calcite) ratio of 5.30 \u00b1 0.51 mmol/mol is obtained. This corresponds to a reconstructed temperature of 0.4 \u00b1 2.1 \u00b0C, which is similar to the ambient seawater temperature of 0.9 \u00b0C. The difference between the Li/Mg-derived temperature and the ambient seawater temperature for the sample showing the highest calcite value (GRC-02-056; 16.5%) is thus significantly reduced, from 26.2 \u00b1 2.4 \u00b0C to 0.5 \u00b1 2.1 \u00b0C. Similar calculations for Porites sp. from Vanuatu provide average corrected temperatures of 27.8 \u00b1 2.1 \u00b0C (1\u03c3 SD, n=7), which is consistent with in situ annual mean value of 27.9 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b0C (Lazareth et al., 2016; Fig. 10). Although the calcite contribution on the Li/Mg proxy can be reasonably corrected based on a linear regression model, it is important to note that regression coefficients might depend on a series Antarctic corals (this study) Lazareth et al., 2016 (Porites sp.) and specific regression lines need to be derived for each case study, making this approach problematic. Here, we emphasise the limitations of the Li/Mg-temperature proxy when utilising both live and fossil coral samples that contain traces of diagenetic calcite and suggest possible solutions rather than attempt to provide robust 'universal' equations. This approach might be employed when working with particularly valuable samples, such as the Antarctic aragonite cold-water corals, rather than discarding samples with detectable calcite. As calcite within the aragonite skeleton can be located using both mRaman and optical microscopy ( Fig. 6), high resolution analysis using laser ablation ICP-MS can be adopted to target pristine aragonite and hence avoid calcite contamination. We focused the laser beam on both the fibrous aragonite and the calcite vein of two Antarctic corals (F. gardineri GRC-02-056 and P. antarcticus GRC-02-014) (Fig. 6). The Li/Ca and Mg/Ca values of the calcite vein are much higher than those in the fibrous aragonite (Table S3), and are consistent with values obtained by extrapolating the linear regressions for Li/Ca (Eq. (1)) and Mg/Ca (Eq. (2)) to 100% calcite (81.51 \u00b1 9.7 \u03bcmol/mol and 91.74 \u00b1 2.13 mmol/mol, respectively). The Li/Mg-derived temperature is ~1.5 \u00b0C for the aragonite portion and ~35 \u00b0C for the calcite vein (Fig. 10, Table S3). This value is close to the Li/Mg-derived temperature using the linear regression extrapolated to 100% of calcite (~37 \u00b0C). Although, laser ablation micro-scale analysis of corals contaminated by calcite appears as a promising method to reconstruct reliable temperature by targeting only pristine aragonite portions, it would not necessarily avoid the issue of organic contaminants. An effective strategy might be to chemically clean coral slabs before analysing the pristine aragonite portions by laser ablation (see D'Olivo et al., 2018). This approach should be tested in the future to assess whether the organic-bound Mg content is totally removed before laser analysis. "}, {"section_title": "Depth and light conditions", "text": "The 25 P. lobata samples collected in New Caledonia along a depth gradient (from 3 to 51 m) were studied in order to investigate the potential effect of depth and light exposure on proxies as recently proposed (e.g. Reynaud et al., 2007;Dissard et al., 2012;Thil et al., 2016). The Li/Mg ratios of these samples do not appear to be affected neither by organic matter nor by the presence of calcite. The Li/Mg-derived temperature, based on the general equation of Montagna et al. (2014), shows an average value of 23.7 \u00b1 0.9 \u00b0C (1\u03c3 SD, n=25) that matches well the ambient seawater temperature (24.4 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b0C, average \u00b1 1SD of the first 51m of the water column) (  Fig. 4). This underestimation of reconstructed temperature with depth may be attributed to the decrease of light availability along the water column. Impact of light on coral proxies (e.g. Sr/Ca, B/Ca, \u03b4 18 O, \u03b4 11 B) has been highlighted previously (e.g. Cohen et al., 2001;Reynaud et al., 2007 Temperature (\u00b0C) This study (Antarctic corals) Porites sp. (Lazareth et al., 2016) al., 2012;Juillet-Leclerc et al., 2014;Thil et al., 2016;Juillet-Leclerc et al., 2018), but its effect on Li/Mg proxy is still to be documented. To confirm the potential effect of light on Li/Mg accuracy, some Porites colonies were collected at various depths (6, 8, 11.5, 15.5 and 28 m; Table 2) under permanent shady conditions."}, {"section_title": "Reconstructed", "text": "temperatures from these colonies tend to slightly underestimate the ambient values, with a mean shift of \u22120.8 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b0C (n=4) for the upper water column (3-15.5 m) and larger underestimation observed for Porites at 15.5m (\u22121.5 \u00b1 0.6 \u00b0C). Such temperature difference is comparable to the values calculated from samples growing in deeper water (35-51 m). Shallow-water samples (3-15.5 m) exposed to direct sunlight show negligible temperature difference (0.0 \u00b1 0.7 \u00b0C) (n=6). These observations confirm the possible influence of light on the Li/Mg ratio as already observed for other geochemical proxies, thus underestimating temperatures with increasing depth/shady conditions, and may represent a source of uncertainty for paleo-reconstructions from shallow water corals. This needs to be corroborated further with other field data (e.g. corals collected along a depth profile), and/or through culture experiments at different light conditions."}, {"section_title": "Refining the Li/Mg calibration and the use of a multi-proxy approach", "text": "Most of the existing exponential and linear Li/Mg-temperature calibrations are not well constrained for the very low polar temperatures (< 1 \u00b0C), especially owing to the paucity of coral living in extreme subfreezing conditions (Case et al., 2010;Hathorne et al., 2013;Raddatz et al., 2013;Montagna et al., 2014;Fowell et al., 2016;D'Olivo et al., 2018;Zinke et al., 2019), with the only notable  (Fig. 11). The regression analysis was also limited to the two datasets and excluded other less well constrained literature data to minimize differences in the analytical techniques and uncertainties associated with different sample treatments applied before the analysis (e.g. different cleaning protocols or coral sub-sampling).  et al., 2010;Raddatz et al., 2013;Hathorne et al., 2013;Montagna et al., 2014;Rollion-Bard andBlamart, 2015 andFowell et al., 2016). The grey and red dashed lines show the 95% confidence and prediction intervals, respectively. Local SST values from the OGA and Tahiti coral sites were obtained from the Tokyo Metropolitan Ogasawara Fisheries Center and Gerard (1992), respectively. For further details, refer to Hathorne et al. (2013). The new multi-species exponential regression is: Li/Mg (mmol/mol) = 5.38 (\u00b10.04) exp (-0.048\u00b10.001 x T) The revised general exponential regression is identical, within the error, to the equation calculated by Montagna et al. (2014). The overall precision, based on the standard error of estimates, is \u00b1 1.0 \u00b0C. If derived from the 95% prediction intervals, the uncertainty of the temperature estimates is \u00b1 0.9 \u00b0C at 1 \u00b0C, \u00b1 1.5 \u00b0C at 12 \u00b0C and \u00b1 2.6 \u00b0C at 25 \u00b0C. Due to the exponential relationship in Eq. (5), the uncertainty becomes larger when the function becomes asymptotic at higher tropical temperatures. Therefore, the application of a general multi-species exponential equation to tropical corals appears to have strong limitations, and linear regression models restricted to the narrow SST range of the tropical species (22-30 \u00b0C) maybe more appropriate (Hathorne et al., 2013;Fowell et al., 2016;D'Olivo et al., 2018;Zinke et al., 2019). Previous studies have highlighted a possible effect of the coral microstructures (COC and fibrous aragonite) on the Li/Mg paleothermometer (Case et al., 2010;Montagna et al., 2014;Rollion-Bard and Blamart, 2015;Marchitto et al., 2018). In particular, COC and fibres have different Li/Mg content, with the COC being generally depleted in Li/Mg compared to the fibres due to a stronger enrichment in Mg compared to Li (Case et al., 2010;Montagna et al., 2014;Marchitto et al., 2018). Similarly, it has been shown that coral Sr/Ca has a microstructure-related pattern, with some studies reporting a preferential Sr/Ca enrichment in COC (e.g. Cohen et al., 2001;Allison et al., 2005) and others showing depleted values (e.g. Shirai et al., 2005) or not much variability between COC and fibres (e.g. Allison et al., 2001;Gagnon et al., 2007). Although these studies used different analytical techniques and investigated different coral species (zooxanthellate and non-zooxanthellate), making results difficult to compare, there do not seem to be a systematic pattern for Sr/Ca in COC vs. fibres. Given that Li/Mg and Sr/Ca ratios depend on both temperature and the amount of COC-fibres within the skeleton, they can be combined as a multi-proxy approach to minimize the microstructure effect. Three recent studies have applied a similar approach using Li/Mg and Sr/Ca, or a combination of Sr/Ca, Mg/Ca and Li/Ca to evaluate potential colony specific offsets in SST sensitivity for the tropical corals Siderastrea siderea (Fowell et al., 2016)  which has a root mean square error of 1.03 \u00b0C, which is slightly better than the value of 1.4 \u00b0C calculated using the exponential equation by Montagna et al. (2014) on the same samples (Fig. 12). Once applied to the New Caledonia P. lobata samples, the multi-proxy equation provides reconstructed temperatures that are closer to the ambient seawater annual mean values, with a root mean square error of 0.6 \u00b0C, compared to 1.0 \u00b0C using the exponential equation by Montagna et al. (2014) (Fig. 13). This implies that using the combination of Li/Mg and Sr/Ca in Porites can effectively reduce the uncertainty of temperature reconstructions and yield values closer to ambient seawater temperatures. However, we did not extend the multi-proxy approach to the entire dataset given the poor sensitivity of Sr/Ca to temperature in coldwater scleractinian corals, with the Sr/Ca ratio being mainly controlled by Rayleigh fractionation processes (Cohen et al., 2006).  2014, and from the Li/Mg -Sr/Ca multi-proxy approach (see text). Uncertainties on regressions are \u00b1 1.0\u00b0C and \u00b1 0.6\u00b0C for Li/Mg and multi-proxy derived temperatures, respectively."}, {"section_title": "Quality criteria for the Li/Mg proxy", "text": "Although we confirm the strong relation of the Li/Mg ratio with seawater temperature based on multi-species exponential calibration from Montagna et al. (2014) (Fig. 11), this study clearly shows that the presence of organic matter, especially that related to endolithic green algae, has a strong effect on the Mg/Ca ratio and hence on the Li/Mg proxy. Thus, organics need to be removed using an oxidative cleaning method as described herein. Furthermore, intra-skeletal calcite deposition in live and fossil corals, even in low concentrations (< 1%), can bias the Li/Mg-reconstructed temperature and needs to be quantified and accounted for. However, given that the error associated with corrections can be large, it is more effective to screen the samples for the presence of calcite by XRD or mRaman. Samples with intra-skeletal calcite can nevertheless be useful to reconstruct paleo-temperatures if the Li/Mg ratios are obtained by laser ablation ICP-MS on pristine fibrous aragonite identified by mRaman.

However, the reliability of Li/Mg ratios is also affected by the contamination of organic matter within green bands linked to Ostreobium algae, and diagenetic calcite within the coral skeleton. Both contaminants are enriched in Mg (and to a lesser degree in Li), leading to unusually low Li/Mg values and hence, to an overestimation of the reconstructed temperature that can be as large as 15-30 \u00b0C. We tested different cleaning protocols to remove the green algal band material, with the most effective chemical treatment being a mix of 15% H2O2 and 0.5M NH4OH. Calcite contamination quantified by XRD can be corrected using the strong linear relationships between Mg/Ca and Li/Ca with the percentage of calcite. However, this requires that XRD must be undertaken on the same powdered samples used for geochemistry, which limits this approach. In contrast, the use of laser ablation ICP-MS together with careful fine-scale observations by optical microscopy or mRaman, can potentially overcome the problem of diagenetic calcite by targeting only pristine aragonite portions. The revised Li/Mg vs. temperature calibration across contrasting environments, from Antarctic to tropical, yields a regression standard error of \u00b1 1.0 \u00b0C. However, owing to the exponential nature of the calibration, large uncertainties are obtained for tropical corals. For these, a multi-linear regression calibration of Li/Mg and Sr/Ca vs. SST shows an identical regression standard error (\u00b1 1.0 \u00b0C) for Porites sp. or better (\u00b1 0.6 \u00b0C) for P. lobata samples from New Caledonia."}]
