[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objectives. Lung disease is a leading cause of disability and death among older adults. We examine whether personality traits are associated with lung function and shortness of breath (dyspnea) in a national cohort with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Method. Participants (N = 12,670) from the Health and Retirement Study were tested for peak expiratory flow (PEF) and completed measures of personality, health behaviors, and a medical history. Results. High neuroticism and low extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness were associated with lower PEF, and higher likelihood of COPD and dyspnea. Conscientiousness had the strongest and most consistent associations, including lower risk of PEF less than 80% of the predicted value (OR = 0.67; 0.62-0.73) and dyspnea (OR = 0.52; 0.47-0.57). Although attenuated, the associations remained significant when accounting for smoking, physical activity, and chronic diseases including cardiovascular and psychiatric disorders. The associations between personality and PEF or dyspnea were similar among those with or without COPD, suggesting that psychological links to lung function are not disease dependent. In longitudinal analyses, high neuroticism (\u03b2 = \u22120.019) and low conscientiousness (\u03b2 = 0.027) predicted steeper declines in PEF. Discussion. A vulnerable personality profile is common among individuals with limited lung function and COPD, predicts shortness of breath and worsening lung function."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "associated with COPD. Anxiety and depression, for example, are prevalent comorbidities in COPD and are associated with worse quality of life and health outcomes for patients with lung disease (Maurer et al., 2008) . Little is known, however, about whether more enduring behavioral, cognitive, and emotional dispositions assessed by personality questionnaires are associated with lung functioning. A few studies have examined the association between personality and COPD with mixed results (Goodwin & Friedman, 2006; Weston, Hill, & Jackson, 2014) , but these studies have not considered measures of lung function or symptoms.\nMost personality traits are captured by five broad dimensions: neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness (McCrae & John, 1992) . These traits, and in particular low conscientiousness and high neuroticism, have been associated with physical inactivity, morbidity, and mortality (Chapman, Roberts, Lyness, & Duberstein, 2012; Hampson, 2012; Kern & Friedman, 2008; Weston et al., 2014) . Given the links between personality and cigarette smoking (Terracciano & Costa, 2004) , chronic inflammation (Luchetti, Barkley, Stephan, Terracciano, & Sutin, 2014) , and age-related diseases (Sutin, Zonderman, Ferrucci, & Terracciano, 2013) , personality traits are likely to be related to COPD and may predict dyspnea and poor and worsening lung function among older adults. Besides COPD, poor lung functioning and shortness of breath are common in other conditions, such as asthma and congestive heart failure.\nEven among healthy older adults, lung function gradually declines with age. Limited lung function can have a significant negative impact on mobility, activities of daily living, and quality of life (Roberts & Mapel, 2012) . Poor lung function may also increase the risk of mild cognitive impairment (DeCarlo et al., 2015) . In addition to COPD, it is thus of interest to examine the psychological correlates of lung function. Furthermore, it is of interest to examine the role of personality in shortness of breath or dyspnea, a patient-centered outcome and an emblematic symptom of poor lung function and COPD.\nUsing data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a population-based cohort of older adults, this study sought to (a) characterize the personality profile of older adults reporting COPD, (b) test the concurrent and prospective associations of personality traits with lung function as measured by peak expiratory flow (PEF) in older adults with and without COPD, and (c) examine the potential role of personality in dyspnea with and without accounting for PEF, COPD, and other comorbidities."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Participants were drawn from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally representative longitudinal study of Americans aged 50 years and older.

Half of the HRS participants completed the interview in 2006; the other half completed it in 2008. Across 2006 and 2008, the sample with complete data on personality and PEF included 12,670 participants. Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for the sample. Of the 12,670 individuals with complete data at baseline, 9,362 participants were assessed again for PEF at the 2010-2012 follow-up interviews. The individuals who were not assessed at follow-up did not differ on sex, race, or ethnicity from those who were assessed at follow-up (p > .05) but were older, had fewer years of education, worse PEF, and scored higher on neuroticism and lower on the other personality traits (p < .05)."}, {"section_title": "Personality", "text": "Personality was assessed using the Midlife Development Inventory (MIDI; Lachman, 2001) .

It is important that you blow as hard and as fast as you can. I would like you to perform the measurement three times. When we are ready to begin, I'll ask you to stand up. Take as deep a breath as possible. Open your mouth and close your lips firmly around the outside of the mouthpiece, and then blow as hard and as fast as you can into the mouthpiece.

Three measurements were taken 30 seconds apart, with the maximum value used as the respondent's PEF in the analyses.\nAs in previous studies (Jackson & Hubbard, 2003; Roberts & Mapel, 2012) , we examined the clinical cutoff of PEF less than 80% of the predicted value based on sex, age, height, race, and ethnicity. As described in a previous study (Roberts & Mapel, 2012) , the equations to estimate the PEF predicted values were based on regression coefficients obtained in a HRS subsample with no history of smoking, COPD, or reports of breathing problems. The equation for the predicted PEF in women was as follows: 350.7 + (\u22124.3 * age) + (4.2 * height) + (\u221226 * Hispanic American) + (\u221227.8 * African American).

"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "With data from a large national sample of older adults, this study found that personality traits are associated with lung function (PEF), lung disease (COPD), and the associated symptomatology (dyspnea). In particular, older adults with higher neuroticism and lower conscientiousness were more likely to have lower PEF and a steeper PEF decline over time, to have COPD, and to suffer from dyspnea. The findings contribute to the aging, personality and health literature. The pattern of associations was consistent across the self-report measures and the performance-based biomarker. Furthermore, the associations between personality traits and PEF or dyspnea were similar among those with or without COPD, suggesting that the association between personality traits and lung function is not disease dependent (i.e., the observed pattern of association is unlikely to be caused by the disease or the COPD ascertainment method). The associations were attenuated but remained significant when accounting for potential mediators and confounders, such as cigarette smoking, physical activity, BMI, and several chronic diseases. Conscientiousness had the strongest and most consistent associations. The significant differences in both neuroticism and conscientiousness between those with and without COPD are consistent with a large literature that links these personality traits to chronic diseases among older adults (Chapman et al., 2012; Goodwin & Friedman, 2006; Hampson, 2012; Jokela, Pulkki-R\u00e5back, Elovainio, & Kivim\u00e4ki, 2014; Luchetti, Terracciano, Stephan, & Sutin, 2015; Sutin et al., 2013; Terracciano et al., 2014; Weston et al., 2014) . COPD is mainly caused by tobacco smoking (DHHS, 2014) , and similar to COPD, smokers tend to score higher on neuroticism and lower on conscientiousness (Malouff, Thorsteinsson, & Schutte, 2006; Terracciano & Costa, 2004; Terracciano, L\u00f6ckenhoff, Zonderman, Ferrucci, & Costa, 2008; Turiano, Whiteman, Hampson, Roberts, & Mroczek, 2012) . Of interest, there is longitudinal evidence that higher neuroticism and lower conscientiousness in children and adolescents predict cigarette smoking into adulthood (Cherry & Kiernan, 1976; Hampson, Goldberg, Vogt, & Dubanoski, 2006; Harakeh, Scholte, de Vries, & Engels, 2006; Kubicka, Matejcek, Dytrych, & Roth, 2001; Munaf\u00f2 & Black, 2007) , which suggests that by increasing risk of smoking, personality may be a risk factor for the eventual development of COPD. For neuroticism, however, there is also evidence that being a smoker has a negative effect on mood and increases anxiety and depression (Jamal, Willem Van der Does, Cuijpers, & Penninx, 2012; Johnson et al., 2000; Parrott, 1998) , whereas quitting smoking is associated with reduced depression, anxiety, and stress (Taylor et al., 2014) . Thus, our findings and previous studies suggest that although personality traits are likely to contribute to the etiology of COPD, cigarette smoking and lung disease may also be associated with change in personality (Jokela, Hakulinen, Singh-Manoux, & Kivim\u00e4ki, 2014; Sutin et al., 2013) .\nOur study also found that irrespective of COPD status, personality predicted concurrent PEF and change in PEF over time. For example, 1 SD higher score on conscientiousness was associated with about a 50% reduced risk of PEF less than 80% of the predicted value. This finding is noteworthy for several reasons. First, among those with COPD, it suggests that personality traits have clinical relevance because neuroticism and conscientiousness predict (a) the current level of PEF performance and (b) the rate of decline in lung function. Second, similar to anxiety and depression (Maurer et al., 2008; von Leupoldt, Taube, Lehmann, Fritzsche, & Magnussen, 2011) , personality traits can aid in detecting individuals with worse functioning and symptomatology and those with worse prognosis in terms of accelerated functional decline. Third, personality traits are also related to treatment adherence (Axelsson, Brink, Lundgren, & L\u00f6tvall, 2011) , and thus personality may help to identify patients who need greater surveillance. Finally, similar to psychiatric conditions, individuals who score higher on neuroticism can benefit from psychotherapy, medications such as antidepressants and anxiolytics, or other interventions (Costa, Bagby, Herbst, & McCrae, 2005; Tang et al., 2009) . One advantage of assessing personality over psychiatric diagnoses is that conditions such as anxiety disorder affect a relatively small proportion of the population, whereas personality assessments characterize the entire population.\nThe performance-based PEF findings also corroborate the results based on the self-reported measure of COPD and the reporting of dyspnea. This convergence is reassuring because COPD is underdiagnosed (Bednarek et al., 2008) and the response to questions on physician-diagnosed COPD tend to have low sensitivity (Murgia et al., 2014) . According to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, 2002) , about 10 million Americans reported physician-diagnosed COPD in 2000, but about 24 million were estimated to have spirometry-based evidence of impaired lung function, according to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; Mannino et al., 2000) . The reporting and diagnosis of COPD is further complicated by its considerable overlap with asthma (Zeki, Schivo, Chan, Albertson, & Louie, 2011) . Responses to questions related to diseases are also subject to potential recall biases, and individuals who score higher on neuroticism are more likely to report more symptoms, to be hypochondriacs, and thus more likely to be diagnosed (Costa & McCrae, 1987) . Despite a range of potential biases and limitations, a consistent pattern of results emerged across self-reports and a performance-based biomarker. The PEF results are also broadly consistent with data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging that found that lower neuroticism and higher extraversion, openness, and conscientiousness were associated with greater aerobic capacity at maximal sustained walking speed . Similarly, in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition study, older adults who scored higher on conscientiousness maintained a faster gait speed over a 3-year follow-up (Tolea et al., 2012) . Thus, across different assessment paradigms, there is consistent evidence that personality traits are associated with older adults' cardiorespiratory fitness.\nShortness of breath is not simply a function of lung capacity, physical health, or psychiatric conditions. There is no perfect correspondence between the level of airflow limitation and the reports of symptoms (Agusti et al., 2010) . Personality may explain some of the variability in the clinical manifestation of COPD. Indeed, our findings indicate that personality was associated with shortness of breath among those with and without COPD. These associations are in part explained by personality links with health behaviors (e.g., tobacco smoking) and objective health status (e.g., PEF), and indeed the association was attenuated when including these variables in the model. Personality traits are also related to other influential factors, from the individual's lifestyle (Stephan, Boich\u00e9, Canada, & Terracciano, 2014) to adherence to medications and other medical treatments (Axelsson et al., 2011) . But even after accounting for demographic factors, cigarette smoking, lung function, heart disease, and psychiatric and other medical conditions, personality traits remained significant predictors of dyspnea. Of clinical relevance, personality was a significant predictor also in the subgroup with poor lung function (PEF < 80% of the predicted value).\nLimitations of this study are mainly the brief assessment of the study variables. However, the large HRS sample size compensates for some of the inaccuracy due to the simpler measurement methods. In particular, spirometry is the gold standard to assess lung function, but it is more time consuming and expensive than the simple PEF test. Although not interchangeable, PEF and spirometry-assessed FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) are highly correlated (e.g., r = .87 in 300 COPD patients; Pothirat et al., 2015) . Further, PEF less than 80% of the predicted value identifies more than 90% of COPD patients and 100% of those with moderate-to-severe COPD (Jackson & Hubbard, 2003) . Similarly, detailed personality questionnaires could provide a more reliable and in-depth assessment, but those are generally more time consuming. The MIDI has weak convergent and discriminant validity, and especially the agreeableness scale is far from optimal. More detailed questionnaires could provide data on the facets that compose each of the five factors that may increase the predictive power of personality (Paunonen & Ashton, 2001; Terracciano et al., 2014) . Another limitation was the attrition of participants who were older, with limited lung function, lower education, and a more vulnerable personality. Despite such loss of follow-up of participants who were most at-risk, the longitudinal analyses indicated that neuroticism and conscientiousness were associated with worsening lung function.\nDespite the limitations, this study clearly indicates that major dimensions of personality, and, in particular neuroticism and conscientiousness, are consistent predictors of lung function and disease among older adults. The associations are evident in the full national sample and in the subgroup with COPD. Thus, the study points to the personality characteristics of those with COPD and suboptimal peak flow performance and supports the notion of reciprocal relations between psychological dispositions and lung function. Similar to psychiatric comorbidities, personality traits can identify individuals at greater risk and with worse prognosis, which has translational utility for the care of older adults."}, {"section_title": "Funding", "text": "HRS is supported by the National Institute on Aging (NIA U01AG009740).
