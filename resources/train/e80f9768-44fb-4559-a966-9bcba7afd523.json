[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of COVID-19, belongs to a family of zoonotic human coronaviruses. Upon the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells, the first set of viral proteins being translated from the single-stranded genomic RNA are encoded by the long (>21kb) ORF1ab, which takes up ~2/3 of the entire viral genome (Figure 1A) (Finkel et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020). The long polyprotein encoded by ORF1ab is subsequently processed into 16 individual nonstructural proteins (nsp) by two proteases, PLpro/nsp3 and 3CLpro/nsp5. The 3\u2019 half of ORF1ab, ORF1b, encodes enzymes critical for viral transcription and replication, including an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp/nsp12), an RNA helicase (Hel/nsp13), a proofreading exoribonuclease and N7-guanosine methyltransferase (ExoN/nsp14), an endonuclease (NendoU/nsp15), and a 2\u2019-O-methyltransferase (nsp16). In all coronaviruses, translation of ORF1b requires a \u22121 PRF event (Plant et al., 2005). When ribosomes arrive at the end of ORF1a, instead of continuing elongation and soon terminating at an adjacent stop codon in the 0 frame, a subset of ribosomes backtrack by one nucleotide and are repositioned in the \u22121 reading frame before continuing the translation elongation cycle, thereby producing a complete ORF1ab fusion polyprotein. The \u22121 PRF region often contains two main components: a heptanucleotide slippery sequence (UUUAAAC in SARS-CoV-2) and a downstream stable secondary structure acting as a frameshift-stimulating element (FSE), which is thought to facilitate \u22121 PRF in part by transiently pausing the incoming ribosome, allowing tRNAs to realign within the slippery sequence. RNA pseudoknots are the most common type of FSEs found in a variety of RNA viruses (Atkins et al., 2016; Namy et al., 2006). In SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and other beta coronaviruses, a three-stem pseudoknot (Figure 1B) has been proposed to act as the productive conformation (Plant et al., 2005), although conformational dynamics of this region have recently been observed (Huston et al., 2020; Lan et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020).\nIn contrast to its wide adoption by RNA viruses, \u22121 PRF is much less prevalent in endogenous mRNAs (Atkins et al., 2016; Clark et al., 2007; Michel et al., 2012). Therefore, viral PRF has been considered an attractive target for specifically interfering with viral gene expression (Brakier-Gingras et al., 2012; Dinman et al., 1998). Indeed, mutations and drugs that alter PRF efficiency have been shown to handicap HIV-1 replication (Brakier-Gingras et al., 2012; Garcia-Miranda et al., 2016; Hung et al., 1998). In addition, an interferon-induced host protein, Shiftless(SHFL), has been shown to interact with HIV-1 FSE RNA, inhibit \u22121 PRF, and restrict HIV-1 replication (Wang et al., 2019), suggesting that frameshift inhibition has become part of the host antiviral response. Several compounds have recently been shown to modulate \u22121 PRF of SARS-CoV-2 to varying degrees (Chen et al., 2020; Haniff et al., 2020; Kelly et al., 2020), although the specificity of these compounds and their antiviral activity remain unclear.\nHere we show that merafloxacin, a member of a large family of antibacterial compounds known as fluoroquinolones, inhibits \u22121 PRF of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, as well as that of other beta coronaviruses. Inhibition of \u22121 PRF by merafloxacin impeded SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells, indicating that merafloxacin represents a promising lead compound for the development of a novel class of PRF-targeting antivirals."}, {"section_title": "A high-throughput screen identifies SARS-CoV-2 PRF modulators ::: RESULTS", "text": "To quantify \u22121 PRF efficiency in uninfected cells, we constructed a plasmid-based frameshift reporter (Figure 1B), replacing the stop codon of a firefly luciferase (FLuc) coding sequence (0 frame) with the SARS-CoV-2 FSE (nucleotide 13,460\u201313,548) including the slippery sequence and the three-stem pseudoknot, followed by a Renilla luciferase (RLuc) coding sequence in the \u22121 frame. Similar designs have been described in recent studies (Kelly et al., 2020). Several observations confirmed that the relative ratio between RLuc and FLuc activity indeed reported \u22121 PRF. First, a stop codon is embedded in the \u22121 frame near the C-terminus of FLuc, ruling out the possibility that RLuc translation initiated within FLuc coding sequence. Second, deleting the slippery site (\u0394SS), disrupting Stem 1 of the pseudoknot by a UAC trinucleotide deletion (\u0394Stem 1), and adding a 0-frame stop codon between FLuc and PRF element (FLuc-Stop), all abolished RLuc activity (Figure 1C), further supporting that RLuc reported on \u22121 PRF. By using a positive control construct in which FLuc and RLuc were translated continuously without frameshifting, we estimated the PRF efficiency to be ~20% in HEK293T cells, consistent with previous measurements (Kelly et al., 2020).\nTo make the PRF reporter more suited for high-throughput microscopy screen, we replaced FLuc and RLuc with mCherry and GFP (Figure 1D), respectively. Similar to the luciferase-based reporter, mCh-FSE-GFP(\u22121) reporter yielded reduced GFP signals compared to the non-frameshifted mCh-GFP fusion construct without an in-frame stop codon (Figure 1D, E). Shifting the GFP back to the 0 frame (mCh-FSE-GFP(0)) completely abolished GFP signal (Figure 1D, E), consistent with the expectation that non-frameshifted ribosomes would terminate at an in-frame UAA stop codon within Stem 1 (Figure 1B).\nWe treated HEK293T cells in 384-well plates with each of 4,434 compounds at 10 \u03bcM final concentration (Figure 1F; Table S1A), which included 640 FDA-approved drugs, 1,600 compounds from the Pharmakon 1600 collection, and 1,872 compounds from a Tested-In-Human collection, and transfected cells with the mCherry-FSE-GFP(\u22121) reporter plasmids. 24 hours after transfection, total cell numbers, as well as mCherry and GFP signals in transfected (mCherry+) cells were quantified. GFP/mCherry ratios were compared to the no-PRF mCherry-GFP fusion positive control as well as the mCherry-FSE-GFP(0) negative control. Our high-throughput microscopy screens showed high robustness, with Z\u2019 scores ranging between 0.91 and 0.95.\nAs expected, the vast majority of the tested compounds had little or no effect on the GFP/mCherry ratio (Figure 1G). Screen actives were selected using mean \u00b1 three standard deviations as cutoffs. The majority of top screen actives were false positives due to their intrinsically fluorescence (e.g., doxorubicin (red) and ampiroxicam (green)), which we ruled out by manual inspection of images (Table S1B). We repurchased remaining eight candidates and tested each of them using the dual luciferase-based PRF reporter assay. Out of these candidates, two compounds, ivermectin and merafloxacin, were validated as an enhancer and an inhibitor of \u22121 PRF, respectively (Figure S1). Although ivermectin has been recently shown to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro (Caly et al., 2020) and is currently under clinical trials against COVID-19, it showed significant cytotoxicity concomitantly with \u22121 PRF enhancement, as indicated by decreased ATP production (Figure S2A) and increased cell death (Figure S2B). In contrast, merafloxacin exhibit modest cytostatic effects at high concentrations (Figure S2C) and did not cause cell death (Figure S2D)."}, {"section_title": "Merafloxacin specifically inhibits \u22121 PRF of beta coronaviruses ::: RESULTS", "text": "Merafloxacin, also known as CI-934, belongs to a large group of antibacterial compounds known as fluoroquinolones (Hooper and Jacoby, 2016; Mandell and Neu, 1986). However, none of the 40 other fluoroquinolones in our compound library (Figure 2A) nor additional fluoroquinolones subsequently tested (Figure S3) inhibited \u22121 PRF, suggesting that the varying moieties at N1, C7, and potentially other positions may be critical for frameshift inhibition (Figure 2B). As expected from the nearly identical FSE sequences of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which differ only by one unpaired nucleotide between Stem 2 and Stem 3 (C13533A), merafloxacin inhibited \u22121 PRF of both coronaviruses with virtually equal efficacy, with IC50 of ~20 \u03bcM (Figure 2C, D). By comparison, overexpression of SHFL, which has previously been shown to broadly inhibit \u22121 PRF, only reduced SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting by ~25% (Figure S4), consistent with a recent report (Schmidt et al., 2020).\nTo test whether merafloxacin may inhibit other viral or cellular \u22121 PRF, we constructed additional reporters using known FSEs from four common human coronaviruses (hCoV-HKU1, hCoV-OC43, hCoV-229E, and hCoV-NL63), avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), West Nile virus (WNV), equine arteritis virus (EAV), and human PEG10 (paternally expressed gene 10) mRNA. Interestingly, merafloxacin inhibited \u22121 PRF of other human beta coronaviruses, hCoV-HKU1 and hCoV-OC43, with similar efficacy (Figure 2E, F). In contrast, merafloxacin had much weaker inhibitory effect on \u22121 PRF of alpha coronaviruses, hCoV-229E and hCoV-NL63 (Figure 2G), whose FSEs have been proposed to form an elaborated pseudoknot structure that substantially differs from that of beta coronaviruses (Herold and Siddell, 1993). Lastly, merafloxacin did no inhibit \u22121 PRF of HIV-1, WNV, EAV, nor human PEG10 mRNA (Figure 2G). These results suggest that \u22121 PRF inhibition by merafloxacin is specific to beta coronaviruses, which share a common three-stem pseudoknot architecture."}, {"section_title": "Frameshift inhibition by merafloxacin is robust to mutations ::: RESULTS", "text": "A rapidly replicating virus may acquire mutations that confer resistance to an antiviral. To test whether frameshift inhibition by merafloxacin may be escaped by mutations that arise within the FSE, we first introduced mutations that have been documented in the expanding SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence database. Consistent with the essential role of \u22121 PRF, mutations within the FSE are exceedingly infrequent. Out of 20 documented single-nucleotide substitutions in this region (Hadfield et al., 2018), only four have been observed more than once (Figure 3A). Two of them (C13476U and C13501U) are in Stem 1, each changing a G:C pair to a G:U pair.\nC13517U is in the terminal loop of Stem 3, whereas C13536U changes a G:C pair in Stem 2 to a G:U pair. Therefore, none of these mutations are expected to disrupt the three-stem pseudoknot architecture. Regardless of the baseline effects of these mutations, merafloxacin inhibited \u22121 PRF of all of these variants with similar efficacy (Figure 3B).\nHaving tested these naturally occurring, structure-preserving mutations, we next introduced sets of synonymous mutations intended to perturb the pseudoknot structure (Figure 3C). U13494G (mutant 1, orange) disrupts a basal U:A pair in Stem 2, causing a 10% reduction in frameshifting (Figure 3D). A13519U/G13520C/U13521A/A13533C (mutant 3, cyan) disrupt the palindromic sequence in the terminal loop of Stem 3 (Ishimaru et al., 2013), causing a 27% decrease in frameshifting. G13503A/C13506U/C13509A/A13512C (mutant 4, green) disrupt multiple base pairs in Stems 1 and 3, causing a 77% reduction in frameshifting. U13524A/U13527C/C13530A (mutant 5, purple) disrupt Stem 3, causing a 42% decrease in frameshifting. Unexpectedly, the U13485C mutation (mutant 2, red) within the loop of Stem 1 caused a 62% decrease in frameshifting (Figure 3D), suggesting an uncharacterized function of this presumably unpaired uridine in promoting \u22121 PRF. Indeed, U13485 and the subsequent G13486 are invariable among all human coronaviruses (Gussow et al., 2020). Despite the wide range of effects of these structure-perturbing mutations, frameshift inhibition by merafloxacin was virtually unchanged (Figure 3D), suggesting that \u22121 PRF inhibition of merafloxacin is robust to perturbations to the FSE sequence or structure."}, {"section_title": "Frameshift inhibition impedes SARS-CoV-2 replication ::: RESULTS", "text": "The identification of a \u22121 PRF inhibitor allowed us to quantify the effect of frameshift inhibition on viral replication. After infecting Vero E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2, we treated cells with varying concentrations of merafloxacin, and quantified viral yields with plaque formation assays. We found that concomitantly with its inhibition on \u22121 PRF, merafloxacin inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication starting from the lowest tested concentration (1.25 \u03bcM) (Figure 4A), with an EC50 of 2.6 \u03bcM and an EC90 of 12 \u03bcM (Figure 4B). At above 40 \u03bcM merafloxacin, viral titer dropped below detection limit (Figure 4A). Importantly, correlating viral titer measurements with the effect of merafloxacin on \u22121 PRF efficiency (Figure 2C) revealed a near-exponential decrease in viral yield as \u22121 PRF was increasingly inhibited (Figure 4C), suggesting that \u22121 PRF efficiency sets the limit of SARS-CoV-2 growth rate."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Coronaviruses have some of the most efficient FSEs. However, the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 can tolerate changes in \u22121 PRF efficiency has been unclear. In one scenario, high \u22121 PRF efficiency could allow coronaviruses to tolerate a small decrease in PRF efficiency while still producing sufficient quantities of replicase components encoded by ORF1b. In this scenario, a large reduction in \u22121 PRF would be required to inhibit viral growth, and drugs targeting \u22121 PRF would be less effective for coronaviruses than for viruses with lower \u22121 PRF efficiency (e.g., HIV-1). The identification of a frameshift inhibitor allowed us to, for the first time, delineate the relationship between frameshift efficiency and viral growth. Our results strongly argue against this scenario. Instead, the near-exponential relationship between viral titer and \u22121 PRF efficiency (Figure 4C) points to a simple model in which ORF1b translation sets the limit of SARS-CoV-2 growth rate, thereby providing strong support for targeting \u22121 PRF as an effective antiviral strategy for SARS-CoV-2 and possibly other RNA viruses with high PRF efficiency.\nOther non-exclusive models might also explain the high sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 replication to \u22121 PRF inhibition. For instance, coronaviruses may require high PRF efficiency to achieve an optimal stoichiometry between the replicase-transcriptase components, which may be disrupted by even a small reduction in \u22121 PRF efficiency. In this case, increasing PRF efficiency would also be detrimental to the virus, as has been shown for HIV-1 mutants (Garcia-Miranda et al., 2016). Furthermore, multiple ORF1b-encoded replicase-transcriptase components may be rate-limiting for replication, in which case small reductions in each of them would multiply and collectively cause a large effect.\nThe molecular mechanism by which merafloxacin inhibits \u22121 PRF is currently unclear. The simplest model would involve the direct binding between merafloxacin and the FSE. Such an interaction may either destabilize the pseudoknot conformation, thereby reducing ribosome pausing and subsequent frameshifting or, on the contrary, further stabilize the pseudoknot structure, thereby causing prolonged stalling, collisions, and/or queuing of the incoming ribosomes. Contrasting ribosome occupancy profiles of either the \u22121 PRF reporter RNA or the viral genomic RNA with and without merafloxacin treatment may distinguish between these scenarios.\nA second possibility is that merafloxacin might stabilize an alternative and unproductive (i.e., non-frameshift-stimulating) FSE conformation. At least one alternative structure with two nested stems has been shown to form in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells by a recent study using dimethyl sulfate probing (Lan et al., 2020). Notably, our \u0394Stem1 mutant is fully compatible with this alternative conformation, yet it lost all frameshift-stimulating activity (Figure 1C), consistent with the notion that this stem-loop structure is an unproductive conformation. A separate study using in-cell SHAPE probing did not detect this stem-loop structure, but instead observed conformational flexibility of Stem 3 in the three-stem pseudoknot (Huston et al., 2020). Therefore, merafloxacin could plausibly interact and stabilize one or more of these alternative structures, thereby decreasing the fraction of RNAs adopting the productive FSE conformation.\nLastly, merafloxacin might target one or more host factors that mediate or modulate \u22121 PRF. Although such factors have not been systematically identified, cellular RNA helicases would presumably help unfold the pseudoknot after the ribosome has shifted to the \u22121 frame and before it continues to translate ORF1b. Considering that the known targets of fluoroquinolones are bacterial DNA topoisomerases (Hooper and Jacoby, 2016), it will be interesting to determine whether their metazoan analogs, some of which have been shown to act on RNAs (Ahmad et al., 2016), may be targeted by merafloxacin."}, {"section_title": "Dual-luciferase PRF reporter assay ::: METHODS", "text": "HeLa and HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (ThermoFisher).
