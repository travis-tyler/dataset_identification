However, any relationship between these conditions remains controversial. Several cross-sectional studies have indicated that knee OA is associated with high BMD [15] . Also, numerous longitudinal studies found that a higher BMD was associated with an increased risk of incident knee OA defined by osteophyte development or the KellgrenLawrence (K-L) grading system [68] . In contrast, a recent study incorporating joint space narrowing (JSN) into the definition of OA found that knee OA was associated with greater bone loss over 2.6 years [9] . In terms of the hand, OA showed a similarly negative association with BMD [1016] . In other studies, increased bone mass seemed not to be associated with a reduced risk of fracture in OA patients [17, 18] . Such varying results have created the assumption that the relationship between OA and osteoporosis is complicated, and that variations in published data may be attributable to differences in the OA diagnostic criteria used and the different joint sites analysed.\nIn previous studies, OA has always been defined using the K-L grading system, which emphasizes osteophytes. The overall grade ranges from normal to severe (03), and the system is relatively insensitive to the subtle change in OA. This limits the K-L grading system to screening of subjects for radiographic diagnosis of OA and for grading gross clinical severity. To circumvent such limitations, it is necessary to use a different scoring system such as a semi-quantitative system to grade the various radiographic features of hand and knee OA [19] .\nSeveral studies have explored relationships between OA and osteoporosis in weight-bearing joints, such as the hip and knee [2, 3] . However, only a few works simultaneously analysed the relationships between OA and osteoporosis of both weight-bearing and non-weightbearing joints in the same population [2022] . Weightbearing activities contribute to the development and maintenance of bone mass, while weightlessness and immobility can result in bone loss. In contrast, weightbearing activities may induce knee OA due to excessive mechanical forces in weight-bearing joints. Therefore, to determine the effect of weight-bearing activities on the relationships between OA and bone mass, it is necessary to compare these relationships between weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing joints.\nRadiographic OA is usually defined by the presence of osteophytes, JSN, malalignment, erosion, pseudocysts and sclerosis in subchondral bone. As any relationship between OA and osteoporosis remains controversial, we hypothesized that different radiographic features of OA would vary in terms of their relationships with the BMDs of the lumbar spine and femoral neck. The aim of our present cross-sectional study on large numbers of community-dwelling older adults was to test this hypothesis."}, {"section_title": "Materials and patients", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "The Dong-gu Study is an ongoing prospective work investigating the prevalence, incidence and risk factors for chronic disease in 9260 subjects aged 50 years or older, as described in detail previously [23] . Baseline data were collected from 2007 to 2010 in the Dong-gu district of Gwangju metropolitan city, South Korea. X-rays of knees and hands were obtained from only 2489 of the 2516 participants during baseline examinations performed in 2009. Of these, 51 subjects with past histories of knee replacement surgery or knee amputation, 49 for whom both hip and lumbar spine BMD data were lacking, 23 for whom 25-hyroxyvitamin D data and 12 for whom lifestyle data were missing were excluded. Finally, the remaining 2354 subjects were analysed.

Smoking was classified as never smoker (smoked <100 cigarettes in their lifetime and not currently smoking) and current smoker (smoked 5100 cigarettes in their lifetime and currently a smoker). Alcohol consumption (within the past 12 months) was defined as current drinker or noncurrent drinker. Physical activity was categorized as irregular or regular based on the frequency of recreational activity and exercise during a single week. Treatment of osteoporosis was defined as current use of any prescription for a drug to treat osteoporosis. Height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm, and weight was measured in the upright position to the nearest 0.1 kg. BMI was calculated as weight divided by the square of height. After finishing the questionnaire, blood samples were collected to measure the serum concentration of 25-hyroxyvitamin D, and were tested by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (ARCHTECT i2000, Abbott, IL, USA)."}, {"section_title": "Measurement of BMD", "text": "In the present study, BMD was measured at the lumbar spine and femoral neck by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (Prodigy; GE, Madison, WI, USA). The lumbar spine BMD was the average BMD of L1L4. Daily phantom scans were performed each morning for quality control. All BMD scans were analysed under blinded conditions using standardized procedures in accordance with the manufacturer's protocols. Any scans with metal or other attenuating material in the region of interest as well as any scans of poor quality were discarded. The coefficients of variation of measurements were <1%.\nAssessment of radiographic features X-rays of both knees and hands were obtained using a computed radiography (CR) X-ray system. When measuring the knees, all participants stood on a Perspex positioning wedge with the knees at 45 flexion. When measuring the hands, all participants pronated the hands with the palmar surface in contact with the cassette and the fingers slightly spread. All images were anteroposterior radiographs, and either knees or hands were evaluated on a single X-ray film. Radiographs were scored by two trained observers blinded to clinical and BMD details, using a semi-quantitative grading system, with reference to the Atlas of Standard Radiographs of Arthritis [19] . The initial results of the two observers were compared and the radiographs were reviewed by a third independent observer in the case of disagreement. The interobserver and intraobserver reliability were tested on a subgroup of the Dong-gu cohort study. The evaluation was performed twice on 100 randomly chosen radiographs (50 radiographs of the knee, 50 radiographs of the hand) by the same observers 1 month apart. Kappa statistics were used to ascertain interobserver ( = 0.790.89) and intraobserver ( = 0.850.92) reproducibility.\nIndividual radiographic features were recorded for the hand [the DIP, PIP and trapeziometacarpal (CMC) joints, the IP joint of the thumb, and the naviculotrapezial (NTJ) joint] and knee (the medial compartment, the lateral compartment, the tibial component and the femoral component). The extent of primary osteophytes and JSN at primary sites (the DIP, PIP and CMC joints, medial tibial and femoral compartments, and lateral tibial or femoral compartments) were graded from 0 to 3 (i.e. 0 = normal, 1 = mild change, 2 = moderate change, 3 = severe change). Other abnormalities (malalignment, erosion, subchondral sclerosis, subchondral cysts, and attrition), and OA at other sites (the IP and NTJ joints), were graded only 0 or 1 (i.e. 0 = absent, 1 = present). Using the semiquantitative grading system, total OA scores were computed by adding the scores of individual radiographic features.\nThe semi-quantitative grading system yielded total OA scores (max. 42) at the knee. The components thereof, namely the osteophyte (max. 24), JSN (max. 12), tibial attrition (max. 4) and sclerosis (max. 2) scores, were calculated and listed as means \u00b1 SD. Also, in the hand, the osteoarthritic total score (max. 70), and the osteophyte (max. 22), JSN (max. 22), subchondral cyst (max. 4), sclerosis (max. 6), erosion (max. 10), and malalignment (max. 6) scores were calculated. Of these, the osteophyte and JSN scores comprised the major proportions of the total scores of both the knee (85.7%) and the hand (62.9%).

Of the 2354 subjects enrolled; 1329 were women (56.5%), of mean age 63.2 years, and most were menopausal. The mean age of men was greater than that of females (P < 0.001). Men were more likely than women to be current smokers and current alcohol drinkers (P < 0.001, both). A total of 274 of the 2354 subjects received osteoporosis treatment. The percentage of osteoporosis treatment was significantly higher in women than in men, as shown in Table 1 (P < 0.001). Twenty-one subjects suffered from RA, and the prevalence rates of self-reported RA were 0.2% in men and 1.4% in women. The frequency of RA was significantly higher in women than in men (P = 0.002). The mean level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D was significantly higher in men than in women (P < 0.001).\nAlthough the BMDs of the lumbar spine and femoral neck were higher in men than in women, men had lower OA total scores of the knees and hands than women (all, P < 0.001).\nRelationships between radiographic features and lumbar spine BMD\nThe relationships between various radiographic features and lumbar spine BMD are shown in Table 2 . Upon multiple linear regression analysis after adjustment for age and gender (Model 1), the knee osteophyte (P < 0.001) and sclerosis scores (P = 0.002) were positively associated with lumbar spine BMD, whereas the knee JSN score (P = 0.019) was negatively associated. After further adjustment for confounders (Model 3), only the JSN score (P < 0.001) remained significantly negatively associated with lumbar spine BMD. In terms of the hand, after adjustment for age and gender (Model 1), the total score (P < 0.001), and the JSN (P < 0.001) and subchondral cyst (P < 0.001) scores were negatively associated with lumbar spine BMD, whereas the osteophyte (P < 0.001) and sclerosis (P < 0.001) scores were positively associated. After adjustment for additional confounders (Model 3), these associations were slightly attenuated (the percentage reductions in regression coefficients ranged from 0% to 20%), but remained significant.\nwww.rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org\nRelationships between radiographic features and femoral neck BMD\nThe relationships between various radiographic features and femoral neck BMD are shown in Table 3 . After adjustment for age and gender (Model 1), the knee JSN (P < 0.001) and tibial attrition (P = 0.036) scores were negatively associated with femoral neck BMD. After adjustment for more confounders (Model 3), these associations were enhanced (the percentage reductions in regression coefficients ranged from 0% to \u00c050%), thus remaining significant. Furthermore, the total OA knee score was negatively associated with femoral neck BMD (P = 0.002). In terms of hand OA, after adjustment for age and gender (Model 1), the total score (P < 0.001), and the JSN (P < 0.001) and subchondral cyst (P < 0.001) scores were negatively associated with lumbar spine BMD, whereas the osteophyte (P = 0.002) and sclerosis (P < 0.001) scores were positively associated. When adjusted for additional confounders (Model 3), these associations were attenuated (the percentage reductions in regression coefficients ranged from 0% to 50%), and others remained significant, except for the osteophyte (P = 0.067).\nRelationships between major OA factors and BMD Finally, we calculated the partial eta-squared values for the fully adjusted model, and found that knee JSN had the largest effect on lumbar spine BMD (eta = 0.005) and femoral neck BMD (eta = 0.015). As the JSN scores were high, we used quartiles thereof to draft the relationships, which smoothly declined (Fig. 1) . Also, hand subchondral cysts had the largest effect on lumbar spine BMD (eta = 0.054) and femoral neck BMD (eta = 0.063).\nWhen the scores were combined with those of hand subchondral cysts, the BMD declined without a break (Fig. 2) ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This study is the first to demonstrate, via separate analysis of the radiographic features of OA, that hand osteophytes and hand sclerosis exhibited positive relationships with the BMDs of the lumbar spine and femoral neck. On the contrary, however, knee JSN, hand JSN and hand subchondral cysts were negatively associated with these BMDs. Knee JSN and hand subchondral cysts exerted the greatest effects on BMD. In previous studies, it was commonly considered that a higher BMD of the lumbar spine or femoral neck was associated with knee OA, as defined by the K-L grading system [15] . Increased bone mass, due to mechanisms related to increased loading of articular cartilage leading to cartilage damage, has been proposed as an independent risk factor for the development of OA. However, cartilage damage can be induced not only by increased bone mass but also by low systemic BMD. Preceding osteoporosis has been shown to aggravate cartilage lesions in an experimental model of OA in rabbits [24] and accelerated "}, {"section_title": "TABLE 2", "text": "The relationship between radiographic features and lumbar spine BMD "}, {"section_title": "TABLE 3", "text": "The relationship between radiographic features and femoral neck BMD bone turnover has been demonstrated in the early stages of OA in several animal models [25] . Although there is insufficient evidence, low bone mass or established osteoporosis was suggested to be a deleterious factor for joint cartilage integrity in a subgroup of patients [26] . In the present study, we combined various features, including osteophytes, JSN, sclerosis and subchondral cysts, and found a negative association between knee OA total score and femoral neck BMD. Although reduced mobility caused by pain can increase bone loss [9] , a decrease in BMD will lead to disruption of the normal balance between bone and cartilage, resulting in initiation of OA. It is necessary to conduct clinical trials to determine the effects of osteoporosis drugs in OA patients with or without preceding osteoporosis to clarify the association of BMD with OA. Although lumbar spine BMD was not correlated with knee OA severity, lumbar spine BMD measurement is usually subject to artefacts including osteophytes, endplate sclerosis, fatty degeneration, and vascular calcification [2730] , all of which can spuriously increase lumbar spine BMDs and potentially impair recognition of coincident spinal osteoporosis [31] . It was found that femoral neck BMD measurements outperformed lumbar spine measurements in predicting global fractures, which is the principal concern in management of osteoporosis [32, 33] . Therefore, lumbar spine BMD is a much less typical and effective measurement than is femoral neck BMD.\nIn terms of knee osteophytes, some previous studies in Caucasians, in which knee OA status was based principally on osteophytes, indicated a positive association between OA and BMD of the lumbar spine or femoral neck. The Rotterdam study indicated that knee radiographic OA was associated with significantly increased BMD (38%) [2] . Similarly, the Framingham study showed that femoral BMD in women is higher in those with osteophytes of the knee [3] . The Chingford study and the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging suggested that radiographic changes in knee OA, specifically osteophytes, are associated with high levels of spine BMD [4, 5] . In contrast to studies in Caucasian populations, a study in elderly Koreans, in which knee OA was defined principally by osteophytes, indicated no association between severity of OA and BMD of the femoral neck [20] , which was consistent with our findings. As body mass, joint surface area and activity pattern in Asians are different from those in Caucasians, further studies are needed to determine the mediating effects of these variables as a way to explain the ethnic differences.\nIn addition, when knee JSN was analysed separately, only one study found that knee JSN (measured cross-sectionally) was negatively associated with hip BMD and that knee JSN (measured longitudinally) was associated with greater total hip-bone loss [9] . Otherwise, JSN has been linked to loss of articular cartilage. Progressive cartilage loss in knees with OA was associated with BMD loss [34] . These results are consistent with ours; we found that knee JSN was particularly strongly associated with lower BMD.\nIn terms of hand OA, we found that the total score was negatively associated with the BMDs of the lumbar spine and femoral neck. Thus, hand OA and BMD exhibited opposite radiographic features. Earlier studies evaluated different proportions of individual OA radiographic features, which meant that some works yielded results similar to ours [11, 13, 21 ] but others did not [4, 22, 35] . The Rancho Bernardo study showed that females with hand OA had a reduced hip BMD [11] . However, the Chingford study indicated that hand OA was associated with significantly higher lumbar spine and hip BMDs [4] . Therefore, rather than exploring relationships between general hand OA and the BMDs of the lumbar spine and femoral neck, independent analysis of relationships between the radiographic features of OA and BMD is more specific and revealing. Other studies used the BMDs of the phalanx, metacarpus and forearm, and found negative relationships between such data and hand OA [8, 10, 12, 1416] . For example, patients with radiographic hand OA had lower distal radius BMD [15] . Also, accelerated metacarpal BMD loss was associated with progressive radiographic hand OA [16] . However, osteophyte formation and subchondral bone remodelling occurring near osteoarthritic joints may affect the BMDs of local bones [36] . Therefore, results derived using the BMDs of bones located near the hand should be excluded, because the relatively high BMDs recorded may be misleading.\nIn our present Korean study, hand osteophytes were found to correlate positively with the BMDs of the lumbar spine. Theoretically, some activities loading the hand, such as grasping, lifting and carrying, may increase the workload in the lumbar region, which can result in osteophytes of the lumbar spine and increased bone mass. In line with this hypothesis, a Japanese study found that BMD was significantly higher in females with than without hand osteophytes [21] , but the BMD was measured at the hand joints, which would be affected by hand osteophytes. Unfortunately, it is impossible to substantiate this hypothesis in the present study because we did not collect information regarding workload or lifestyle in all participants. In terms of the sclerosis that we studied (defined as an increased bone density or thickening in the subchondral layer), this was similarly associated with BMD.\nOur first finding was a significantly negative relationship between BMD and JSN and hand subchondral cysts; this is a novel feature. As is true of knee JSN, hand JSN reflects the loss of articular cartilage, which may in turn induce bone mass loss. However, the molecular mechanism of the association between JSN and BMD remains unclear. Notably, subchondral cysts form one of the four cardinal radiological features of OA, and such cysts have recently been shown to be the final pathological manifestation of OA. Furthermore, the appearance of subchondral cysts also indicates that the erosive phase of OA progression is severe [37] . Based on such observations, subchondral cysts, a severe feature of OA, could play an important role in altering BMD, as suggested by our results.\nThe highlights of our study are that we analysed the radiographic features of OA independently; we compared weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing joints in the same subjects simultaneously; and we used a semi-quantitative grading system to evaluate the severity of OA. Also, we adjusted for several confounding factors (physical activity, current smoking status, current alcohol consumption, history of RA and osteoporosis treatment, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D), which are well-known risk factors for reduced BMD, but most other studies did not collect such data. Moreover, we studied a large number of communitydwelling older adults, originally over 10 000 in number.\nwww.rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org However, some limitations of the present study should also be noted. Firstly, our semi-quantitative grading system remains imperfect, as is the K-L grading system, both of which feature visual assessment of the severity of radiographic features. Secondly, no longitudinal survey of changes in BMD and OA has been performed, but we plan to conduct such work. Thirdly, although many important confounding factors for OA and BMD were adjusted, other variables, such as the job strain, joint pain, and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids were not adjusted because we did not collect this information at the time of enrolment. In spite of this, we still believe that our present findings are adequately adjusted to trigger more clinical studies evaluating the relationships between OA and BMD.\nIn summary, when associations between the BMDs of the lumbar spine and femoral neck, and OA are sought, site-independent analysis of the radiographic features of OA is more specific and revealing than is use of the total OA score. We found that hand osteophytes and hand sclerosis exhibited positive relationships with BMD; in contrast, knee JSN, hand JSN, and hand subchondral cysts were negatively associated with BMD. Knee JSN and hand subchondral cysts had the greatest effects on BMD."}]
