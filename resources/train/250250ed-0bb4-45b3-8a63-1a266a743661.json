[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 has led to a rapid and proactive response from medical and AI communities worldwide. In information retrieval and natural language processing, efforts have concentrated on building datasets and tools for efficiently managing the growing literature on COVID-19, historical coronaviruses, and other related diseases (Hutson, 2020) . One of the main stimuli for the creation of new technology was the release of the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) , a regularly updated collection of coronavirus-related publications and preprints. But while many tools have emerged for the purposes of article retrieval and question answering, 1 relatively less work has been devoted to designing systems that go beyond returning a list of (relevant) documents, and that attempt to leverage domain knowledge to organise and present information found within the literature. With our work, we aim to fill this gap by making available a web application that combines a search 1 A non-exhaustive list: cord19.vespa.ai, discovid.ai, covidex.ai engine for COVID-19-related literature with different visualisation techniques, that make it easy to see and explore salient topics, concepts and concept relations in the documents.\nWe build on observations about the relevance of exploratory search, and the need to combine learning and investigation with direct retrieval for information seeking (Marchionini, 2006) , specifically designing a tool to support the health information seeking behaviour observed by Pang et al. (2015) of alternating between exploratory and focused search. We further draw on the insights from research in information visualisation that demonstrate the value of multiple coordinated views of documents, with a specific emphasis on visually illustrating connections between entities (Stasko et al., 2008; G\u00f6rg et al., 2010) .\nWe designed our tool to support medical experts and other researchers by way of literature discovery. A typical usage scenario in COVID-SEE begins with a textual query over CORD-19, providing the researcher with: (i) a list of retrieved documents, and (ii) a visualisation dashboard. The user can then select the documents of interest and save them into a briefcase for later use. Once the user has populated the briefcase with relevant articles, it is possible to set the briefcase as the current active collection, and further explore those articles.\nIn both the retrieval and visualisation components, we adopt several well-established NLP techniques. Article retrieval is powered by an existing neural search engine specifically developed for the CORD-19 dataset (Zhang et al., 2020) . The results are shown as a list of document hits with metadata about the articles. Separately, the dashboard represents the current active collection with three distinct interactive views. The first is a relational concept view in which we employ Sankey diagrams to organise the medical concepts found in the articles according to broad, clinically-relevant PICO categories (Richardson et al., 1995) , such as population, intervention and outcome. In this view, more salient relations carry more weight, and once a relation is clicked, the corresponding articles are revealed. We use an example based on the query incubation period of COVID-19 to illustrate this functionality (Fig. 1) . The second, topic view ( Fig. 3) , is more thematic and shows representative topics for the current collection. For this component, we trained a global topic model on medical concepts extracted from CORD-19. Our third component is a concept cloud view (Fig. 4) , showing the most salient concepts for each active document."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "CORD-19 is currently the most extensive coronavirus literature corpus publicly available . The dataset contains all COVID-19 and coronavirus-related research (e.g. SARS, MERS, etc.) from different sources, including PubMed's PMC open access corpus, research articles from a corpus maintained by the WHO, and bioRxiv and medRxiv pre-prints. The corpus is updated daily and consisted of more than 130,000 documents as of 6 June. Together with the release of the CORD dataset, a Kaggle challenge 2 took place in which we also participated.\n3 System overview 3.1 Information retrieval After submitting a query, a list of retrieved documents is shown. Each document entry can be expanded to display the entirety of the abstract as well as metadata (authors, journal, source, year, license). The user can also filter by criteria such as year and source. Articles can be selected and added to the user's briefcase. This briefcase represents the set of documents that the user wishes to keep track of, and can be visualised, versioned, and exported.\nWe make use of an existing information retrieval system for the CORD-19 dataset, available at covidex.ai (Zhang et al., 2020) . This provides us with a well-performing retrieval system-by our analysis, in the top 30% of submissions to the TREC-COVID shared task (Roberts et al., 2020) . "}, {"section_title": "Relational concept view", "text": "Given a collection of retrieved documents, the user can directly proceed to the dashboard to explore the collection. A key view over the collection is via a Sankey diagram frame, which organises the identified medical concepts into PICO categories (Population, Intervention/Comparator, Outcome), and shows how they interact. The diagram displays relations between pairs of medical concepts, where the strength of a relation corresponds to the number of supporting abstracts in which that concept pair is attested. To obtain the PICO concepts, we follow a two-step procedure, as described below. dataset (Nye et al., 2018) , which contains \u223c5,000 MEDLINE 3 abstracts of reports of randomised clinical trials annotated with textual spans that describe the PICO elements. As pretrained word representations for the model, we use 200-dimensional word2vec embeddings induced on PubMed abstracts and MEDLINE articles (Hakala et al., 2016) . We observe a micro-averaged F1 score of 0.69 on the EBM-NLP test set, and report the full results in Table 1 ; these are comparable to those reported in Nye et al. (2018) . For our purposes, getting the textual span exactly correct is less important, as our final representations are not the snippets but the medical concepts that occur inside them. The PICO identification step is applied to all abstracts of the CORD-19 dataset. Recognition of PICO concepts In this step, we recognise medical concepts that occur within the identified PICO spans. This is part of a larger concept recognition procedure that we describe in more detail in Section 3.3. Here, we take the terms corresponding to Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), 4 which is a structured vocabulary maintained by the National Library of Medicine. We use MeSH due to its transparent hierarchical structure, making it easy to control term granularity. Additionally, it is also an established way to represent keywords found in medical articles indexed by PubMed. A few examples of extracted PICO concepts are shown in Table 2 ."}, {"section_title": "PICO span identification", "text": "Establishing relations The output of the previous two steps is the extracted MeSH terms for each article, typed by their respective PICO category. In the Sankey diagram, we then display pairwise relations between Population-Intervention and Intervention-Outcome concepts. Two concepts are related when they are found in the same abstract. We also include the strength of the connection, corresponding to the absolute frequency of that concept pair in the entire dataset. The user can select a concept relation link of interest, browse the relevant articles containing that relation, and save them to the briefcase for further exploration. The rendering of the diagram is dynamic. This means that whenever a document collection selected by the user changes, the diagram is updated. In addition, the Sankey view is interactive, allowing the user to click on any relation to highlight the relevant part of the diagram and show the supporting documents. A planned future release of our tool will support semantic search, which will enable the use of PICO-typed MeSH terms as search criteria."}, {"section_title": "Medical concept recognition", "text": "To allow for more conceptual representation of the documents, we transform them into an unordered set of Unified Medical Language System 4 ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh (UMLS: Lindberg et al. (1993) ) concepts. These concepts are extracted using MetaMap 5 from the document's abstract, or, if it is absent, from the first two paragraphs. This choice of representation is motivated as follows: (1) it avoids splitting multi-word concepts (such as degenerative disease of the central nervous system) into less meaningful units (of , the, central, etc.), as would happen in the case of token-based representation; and (2) it maps different lexico-grammatical variations of a given term into a single concept, thus reducing noise in the data, and highlighting important keywords. For example, concept C0000731 occurs in the articles as abdominal distension, abdominal distention, bloating, distended abdomens, swelling of abdomen, etc., which would not be captured by typical approaches to text normalisation such as lemmatisation, stemming, or n-gram overlap. We represent each MetaMap-disambiguated concept by the lexicalisation that occurs most frequently in the document collection, as distinct from the MetaMap \"preferred term\", which is often a technical description rather than its lexical form (e.g. we use colon instead of preferred term Colon structure (body structure)). As the last step, we remove stopwords based on PubMed's stopword list 6 and the 100 most frequent tokens in the dataset. The resulting representation (Table 3) forms the foundation of the remaining analysis and visualisations."}, {"section_title": "Topic view", "text": "To enable document exploration based on common semantic themes, we provide a topic modelling view.

After learning the topic distribution for the whole dataset, we display only those topics which are representative of the selected subset, that is, ones for which the average weight across the selected documents is over a threshold t, which we set to 0.05. Thus, the topic selection is dynamic for each set of selected documents."}, {"section_title": "Concept cloud view", "text": "For each of the documents in the user's briefcase, we display a wordcloud 8 containing the 20 most representative concepts. We regard each of the articles in the briefcase as a target corpus, and the remainder of the articles in the briefcase as a background corpus, and compare concept distributions using the log-likehood test (Rayson and Garside, 2000) . This highlights concepts that differentiate a particular document from others in the briefcase, even if they discuss similar topics and have the same set of frequent terms. For instance, if the briefcase contains articles regarding mechanical ventilation and we choose one of them, 9 the top 10 concepts chosen by log-likelihood will be similar to 10 most frequent concepts, but with two visible differences (Table 4) : the log-likelihood results do not contain common terms as mechanical ventilation, frequently used in all documents in the briefcase; on the other hand, they include more document-specific concepts as ai (avian influenza)). Table 4 also shows how operating at the concept level captures multi-word terms such as mechanical ventilation and admitted to intensive care unit.\n8 github.com/chrisrzhou/react-wordcloud 9 pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18440440"}, {"section_title": "Technical details", "text": "All data is stored in a graph database (neo4j 10 ).

We provide a summary of the existing tools and their functionalities in Table 5 . AllenAI's SciSight Faceted Search (Hope et al., 2020) 15 is a tool for exploring how authors and topics interact over time. The user can select the desired topics from different PICO-like categories, which act as a filter for the shown articles. It also provides a co-mentions view with chord diagrams, which displays associations between diseases and chemicals, or between proteins, genes and cells. This is conceptually similar to our goal of representing concept relations, but their diagram view does not support PICO.\nThe identification of PICO elements in SciSight is based on DOC Search, 16 , where a user constructs a query by accepting auto-suggestions based on an ontology. The selected terms can be combined with a variety of Boolean and ontological operators. The user can then use the data visualisations to further narrow down the search results.

It does not currently support semantic search based on PICO-style queries; a natural extension would be to add this functionality utilising the PICO and UMLS concept pre-processing. A recommendation system for articles which have similar topic distributions could be added. In terms of visual representations, we will experiment with expanding beyond the MeSH term vocabulary to include more specific terminology, and use of the hierarchical relationships that exist between terms. Finally, we are planning a user study with medical professionals to evaluate the potential of COVID-SEE as a knowledge discovery tool."}]
