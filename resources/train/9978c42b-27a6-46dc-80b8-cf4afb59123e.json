This is an accomplishment that many thought unachievable when 1988 legislation first authorized state NAEP on a trial basis. (The same legislation established the National Assessment Governing BoardNAGB to set policy for both state and national NAEP.) The second point is a more substantive one, which has emerged from the results themselves. Over the past decade, differential progress has been made by students in the key subjects of reading and mathematics."}, {"section_title": "State NAEP Proves Its Value", "text": "At the end of its first decade, state NAEPno longer considered a \"trial\" since 1996 is doing well as the nation's only ongoing independent measure of student achievement at the state level in the key subjects of reading, writing, mathematics, and science. State NAEP is the only assessment that allows states to compare their students' performance to that of students in other states using a common assessment instrument. This capability has made state NAEP a valuable commodity for the state education policy, research, and assessment communities. Every state and jurisdiction, with the exception of one, has participated in at least one of the state assessments. An average of 40 states and jurisdictions volunteer to participate in each state assessment cycle. As many as 15,800 schools and about 400,000 students volunteer to participate in the now typical two-subject, two-grade state assessment program. As NAGB has laid new ground for more contemporary content frameworks to guide development of the NAEP assessments, both the state and national assessments have become progressively more challenging in the knowledge, skills, and abilities that they assess as well as in their assessment specifications (e.g., the number of multiple-choice items has been reduced, while the number of constructed-response items has been increased). 7 4 NATIONAL CENTER FOR EDUCATION STATISTICS NAEP Results Show More Improvement in Mathematics Than in Reading NAEP national and state-level results show that students across the nation are making marked progress in mathematics but very little progress in reading. In general, national reading scores have remained about the same since 1992 except for a small increase for eighth-graders between 1992 and 1998, when the most recent eighth-grade reading assessment was conducted. Consistent with these national results, the results of state-level reading assessments at grade 4 show that relatively few states had significant score increases or declines between 1992 and 1998. Mathematics results, on the other hand, have shown progress over the past decade for nearly every subgroup of the population and across almost all states and jurisdictions'that participated in the assessments. Over the past decade,. Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, males, females, and students in the fourth, eighth, and twelfth grades have all shown increases in their mathematics scores. Improvement has also occurred at all percentiles. Thus, although the achievement gap in mathematics between Whites and minorities has not changed over the past decade, students scoring in the two lowest percentiles (the 10th and 25th), in which minorities are disproportionately represented, have shown score increases since 1990 at all three grades. Out of the 36 states and jurisdictions that participated in both 2000 and the first state assessment at grade 4 in 1992, 26 showed increases from 1992. At grade 8, of the 31 states and jurisdictions that participated in both 2000 and the first state assessment in 1990, 27 showed increases over the decade. The achievement level results in reading and mathematicsthat is, the . percentages of students attaining the Basic, Proficient, and Advanced levels adopted by NAGBshowed similar patterns. Thus, the data described in this issue of the Quarterly are a fitting example of the substantive value of a decade of measuring student achievement. As intended when NAEP was first mandated, the NAEP 2000 Mathematics Assessment provides an excellent basis for dialogue among curriculum experts and practitioners concerning \"what students know and can do.\""}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the nation's only ongoing representative sample survey of student achievement in core subject areas. Authorized by Congress and administered by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the U.S. Department of Education, NAEP regularly reports to the public on the educational progress of students in grades 4, 8, and 12. In 2000, NAEP conducted a national mathematics assessment of fourth-, eighth-, and twelfth-grade students. Statelevel results were also collected at the fourth and eighth grades within participating states and jurisdictions. This article presents highlights from the NAEP 2000 Mathematics Assessment for the nation and the states. Results in 2000 are compared to results in 1990, 1992, and 1996. Following the performance results are several sample questions and student responses typical of those from recent NAEP mathematics assessments. Students' performance on the assessment is described in terms of average scores on a 0-500 scale and in terms of the percentages of students attaining three achievement levels: Basic, Proficient, and Advanced. The achievement levels are performance standards adopted by the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) as part of its statutory responsibilities. The achievement levels are collective judgments of what students should know and be able to do: Basic denotes partial mastery of prerequisite knowledge and skills that are fundamental for proficient work at each grade. Proficient represents solid academic performance for each grade assessed. Students reaching this level have demonstrated competency over challenging subject matter, including subject-matter knowledge, application of such knowledge to real-world situations, and analytical skills appropriate to the subject matter. Advanced signifies superior performance. As provided by law, the Acting Commissioner of Education Statistics, upon review of a congressionally mandated evaluation of NAEP, determined that the achievement levels are to be considered developmental and should be interpreted and used with caution. However, both the Acting Commissioner and NAGB believe these performance standards are useful for understanding trends in student achievement. They have been widely used by national and EDUCATION STATISTICS QUARTERLY  VOLUME 3, ISSUE 3, FALL 2001 state officials, including the National Education Goals Panel, as a common yardstick of academic performance. In addition to providing average scores and achievement level performance at the national and state levels, this article includes national results for selected subgroups of students as well as a discussion of home and school contexts for mathematics performance. However, this article does not include results for a second sample of students assessed at both the national and state levelsone in which testing accommodations were provided to students with special needs (i.e., students with disabilities or students with limited English proficiency). For results that include the performance of special-needs students who were At grade 12, the results are mixed. From 1996 to 2000, there was a decrease in the percentage at or above Basic. However, the percentage of twelfth-graders at or above both Basic and Proficient was higher in 2000 than in 1990.\nThis report on the private school universe presents data on schools with grades kindergarten through 12 by school size, school level, religious orientation, geographical region, community type, and program emphasis. The numbers of students and teachers are reported in the same categories. The number of students is also reported by race/ethnicity, gender, and grade level. Tables in the complete report present data by three classification schemes: private school typology, religious orientation, and association membership. The private school nine-category typology is based on methodological work completed at the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Each of the primary divisions (Catholic, other religious, and nonsectarian) is subdivided into three additional categories: Catholic into parochial, diocesan, and private order;' other religious into conservative Christian, affiliated with a national denomination or other religious school association, and unaffiliated; and nonsectarian into regular program, special emphasis, and special education. The Private School Survey (PSS), conducted biennially by the U.S. Bureau of the Census for NCES, is designed to collect data from all private schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The PSS conducted in 1999-2000 is the data source for this report. The counts presented here are estimates derived from a collection of state and private school organization and association lists combined with an area frame. (An estimate of the undercount of schools using this methodology is given in the complete report.) Although, beginning in 1995, the PSS definition of a school was expanded to include those schools for which kindergarten was the highest grade, referred to as kindergartenterminal (k-terminal) schools, all estimates presented in this report, unless otherwise stated, are for schools (traditional schools) meeting the more restrictive pre-1995 PSS definition of having at least one of grades 1 through 12.\nThe National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) is a comprehensive survey that examines how students and their families pay for postsecondary education. The study includes nationally representative samples of undergraduate, graduate, and first-professional students; students attending less-than-2-year, 2-year, 4-year, and doctorate-granting institutions; and students who receive financial aid and those who do not receive aid. This report has been prepared to provide some key estimates as policymakers, researchers, and analysts begin working on research for the next reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. It is based on information from about 50,000 undergraduates, 11,000 graduate students, and 1,000 first-professional students enrolled at approximately 1,000 postsecondary institutions during the 1999-2000 academic year. The sample represents about 16.5 million undergraduates, 2.3 million graduate students, and 330,000 first-professional students enrolled at any time between July 1, 1999, and June 30, 2000. Considerably more detail on how students finance their postsecondary education and student background characteristics will be published in subsequent reports. Estimates in this report focus primarily on percentages of students receiving specified types of financial aid, and average amounts of specific types of financial aid received. Unless otherwise noted, all average amounts of financial aid described here and presented in the tables reflect the weighted means and are based only on the recipients of the specified types of aid. Highlights are presented separately for undergraduates and graduate and first-professional students.\nThis report presents detailed tabulations for the 1998-99 academic year that describe characteristics of the 9,653 postsecondary education institutions in the United States (50 states and the District of Columbia) and outlying areas (table A).' These characteristics include tuition and required fees for undergraduate, graduate, and firstprofessional programs and room and board charges at institutions providing these accommodations. Data are from the \"Institutional Characteristics Survey,\" a component of the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) of the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). This report also provides a comparison between 1993-94 and 1998-99 tuition, required fees, and room and board charges for the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Postsecondary education is the provision of a formal instructional program whose curriculum is designed primarily for students who are beyond the compulsory age for high school. This includes programs whose purpose is academic, vocational, and continuing professional education, and excludes avocational (leisure) and adult basic education programs. For the 1998-99 academic year, 9,485 institutions in the 50 states and the District of Columbia and 168 in the outlying areas fit the IPEDS definition (table A). IPEDS attempts every year to identify institutions that should be included in the universe. Because of the changing nature of the postsecondary education enterprise (\"births\" and \"deaths\" of institutions), there may be more than the 9,653 postsecondary institutions currently identified in IPEDS. In 1998-99, IPEDS collected data from over 9,600 postsecondary institutions, with more than 6,500, or 68 percent, of the institutions having a Program Participation Agreement (PPA) with the Department of Education and thus eligible to participate in Title IV programs. Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (as amended) established federal financial aid programs (e.g., Pell Grants, Stafford Loans) for students attending postsecondary institutions. Students attending institutions with a PPA may be eligible either to receive Title IV funds or to defer repayment of their loans. The IPEDS universe also classifies institutions by degreegranting status. Institutions are considered degree-granting if they offer at least one associate's or higher degree. In 1998-99, almost 4,600, or 48 percent, of all IPEDS institutions granted degrees. Forty-three percent of the postsecondary institutions in 1PEDS were Title IV participating and degree-granting in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and outlying areas. While this summary focuses on all postsecondary institutions, many of the tables presented in the complete report provide information on the subsets of 6,431 Title IV participating and 4,500 degree-granting institutions in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.\nA large proportion of undergraduates attend community colleges (public 2-year institutions) seeking a wide range of services, from a place to experiment with postsecondary education to a structured vocational certificate or associate's degree program (Grubb 1988(Grubb ,1991. Although the course offerings and degree programs of many community colleges can accommodate diverse student interests and goals, preparing students to transfer to a 4-year college remains a central characteristic of community colleges (Brint and Karabel 1989). This preparation is key to the community college's role in higher education because it affirms the community college's claim to a collegiate, academic identity and to a role in broadening access for those historically excluded from a college education. Moreover, transfer is a component of most community college students' educational aspirations (Grubb 1991, pp. 195-96). Despite, or perhaps because of, the importance of transfer from 2-to 4-year institutions, calculating the percentage of community college students who transfer has proven to be somewhat problematic. At first glance, the transfer rate seems relatively unambiguous: it is the number of students who transfer to a 4-year college divided by the number of potential transfer students. However, the numerator and especially the denominator can both be defined in a number of different ways, each having a significant impact on the transfer estimate. The purpose of the present study is to use nationally representative community college data to examine several ways of defining the population of potential EDUCATION STATISTICS QUARTERLY  VOLUME 3, ISSUE 3, FALL 2001 transfer students, the relationship of these definitions to student background characteristics, and the relationship of each definition to the resulting transfer rate. This report consists of three sections. The first section describes the data set used in the analysis and the measurement issues implicated in the study of transfer. The second section presents the selected indicators of the key concepts in the study and the results of the analysis. The report concludes with a discussion of the results in the context of other studies of community college students and transfer."}, {"section_title": "National average scores at different percentiles", "text": "The gains in average mathematics scores at all three grades since 1990 are reflected in students' performance across the score distribution.

Answer:\nThe percentage of fourth-graders who reported spending \"a lot\" of time studying three of the six civics curriculum topics surveyedelections and voting, President and leaders of our country, and judges and courtsincreased between 1988 and 1998 (table A). For both 8th-and 12th-graders, the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights is the one curriculum topic, of the 10 topics surveyed at these grade levels, that was studied \"a lot\" by the majority of students in both 1988 and 1998. The amount of time spent studying the various civics topics surveyed at grades 8 and 12 was similar and has not changed between 1988 and 1998.\n\nMost states were closely clustered around the national average (61.7 percent) in terms of the share of current expenditures that were spent on instruction; all but three states and the District of Columbia spent more than 58.0 percent of their current expenditures on instruction (table 4). These states were Alaska, Kansa, and New Mexico. Two states spent more than two-thirds of their current expenditures on instruction. These states were New York (67.8 percent) and Maine (67.3 percent).\nRelated in part to family income, racial/ethnic group differences also were apparent. Black students were much less likely than either White or Asian/Pacific Islander students to complete rigorous curricula (8 percent vs. 20 and 31 percent, respectively) and more likely to complete programs no higher than the core curriculum (42 percent vs. 29 and 27 percent). Asian/Pacific Islander students were the most likely to complete rigorous curricula (31 percent). While it appears as though White students were more likely than Hispanic students to complete rigorous curricula (20 percent vs. 16 percent) and less likely to complete no higher than core curricula (29 percent vs. 34 percent), there was not enough statistical evidence to draw this conclusion. High school academic curriculum also had an obvious association with where students first enrolled in college. As the level of curricula increased, so did students' likelihood of attending selective 4-year colleges or universities.3 For example, 71 percent of students who completed rigorous curricula enrolled in a selective college or university, compared with 40 percent who completed midlevel curricula and 32 percent who completed core curricula or lower.\n25.0 50.9 24.0 'Selective institutions are public and private not-for-profit institutions in which students' average SAT scores exceeded 1000 or Carnegie classifications in which a majority of students were enrolled in very selective institutions. 2Less-selective institutions are all others not identified in the selective groups. 'Core curriculum includes 4 years of English, 3 years of social studies, 3 years of mathematics, and 3 years of science. 4Mid-level curriculum exceeds core curriculum, but is less than rigorous. Includes at a minimum 1 year of a foreign language, geometry, algebra I, and 3 years of science including two of the following courses: biology, chemistry, or physics. 'Rigorous curriculum includes 4 years of English, 4 years of mathematics (including precalculus or higher), 3 years of a foreign language, 3 years of social studies, 3 years of science (including biology, chemistry, and physics), and at least one Advanced Placemenf(AP) class or test taken. \nto students whose parents had a college degree. By the end of the 1997-98 academic year, a larger proportion of firstgeneration students (25 percent) had chosen business/ management as their major field of study, compared with their non-first-generation counterparts (17 percent). In general, first-generation students had lower first-year GPAs than students whose parents had a college degree (2.6 vs. 2.8) and were more likely to have taken at least one remedial course during their first year of postsecondary education (21 percent vs. 10 percent). This differente persisted even after controlling for the rigor of students' high school coursework and college entrance examination scores. Among students who substantially exceeded the core New Basics in high school, first-generation students were more likely to have taken at least one remedial course during their first year of postsecondary education than students whose parents had a college degree (15 percent vs. 6 percent). Moreover, among students whose college entrance examination scores were in the lowest quartile, 38 percent of first-generation students had taken at least one remedial course during their first year, compared with 29 percent of students whose parents had a college degree. However, among students who took rigorous high school courses or scored in the top quartile on their college entrance examinations, first-generation students had firstyear college GPAs and remedial coursetaking patterns that were not significantly different from their non-firstgeneration peers. For example, among students who took rigorous coursework in high school, 95 percent of firstgeneration students reported taking no remedial courses during their first year, compared to 96 percent of students whose parents had some college and 97 percent of students whose parents had a bachelor's degree. In addition, firstgeneration students' average first-year GPA was 3.0, which was no different from the average GPA (3.1) of their nonfirst-generation counterparts with similar academic preparation.\nAmong the Title IV loan recipients enrolled in private not-for-profit doctorate-granting institutions, the average loan amount was $5,161. At private not-forprofit non-doctorate-granting 4-year institutions, the average received was $5,095. Among the Title IV loan recipients enrolled in public doctorate-granting institutions, the average student loan amount was $4,743. At public non-doctorategranting 4-year institutions, the average received was $4,225. Fifty-four percent of students enrolled in private for-profit less-than-2-year institutions received a Title IV loan; the average received was $4,879. Among full-time, full-year undergraduates, about 40 percent of those at public 2-year institutions, 56 percent of those at public 4-year institutions, and 67 percent of those at private not-for-profit 4-year institutions received some Title IV financial aid.\nstate undergraduate students at these same institutions paid an average of $8,248 for tuition and required fees. The fulltime, full-year graduate tuition and required fees averaged $3,555 for in-state and $8,310 for out-of-state students at the 511 responding public 4-year institutions. The 1,173 responding public 2-year institutions reported that in-state students attending their institutions were charged an average of $1,697 for tuition and required fees (table B). Out-of-state students attending these same institutions were charged an average of $4,006, a difference of $2,309. There were 158 responding less-than-2-year institutions, with average tuition and fees for in-state students of $2,809 for 1998-99, compared to $3,479 for out-of-state students. Private institutions For the purpose of IPEDS, private institutions are defined as educational institutions controlled by a private individual(s) or by a nongovernmental agency, usually supported primarily by other than public funds and operated by other than publicly elected or appointed officials. There are two types of private institutions in IPEDS: forprofit and not-for-profit. This report discusses these two types of institutions separately. The charge for full-time, full-year undergraduate students to attend 4-year private not-for-profit institutions in 1998-99 averaged $11,229 for tuition and required fees (table B). Since very few private institutions charge different out-of-state tuition, the charge for out-of-state undergraduates averaged $11,246, just $17 more than the charge for in-state students. The median charge was $11,173 for in-state and $11,180 for out-of-state undergraduate students, only a $7 difference. The median charge for out-of-state graduate students was higher at public institutions ($8,046) than at private not-for-profit institutions ($7,630) or private forprofit institutions ($7,440). In fact, the median charge for out-of-state graduate students at private for-profit institutions was more than $600 lower than at public institutions, and the median charge was more than $400 lower at private not-for-profit institutions than at public institutions.\nPostsecondary Institutions in the United States: 1993-94 and1998-99  100 population of 50,000 or more.

Further, Black college attendees with levels of prior educational achievement similar to those for Whites completed college at rates similar to, or higher than, the rates for White college attendees.\nCommunity College Transfer Rates to 4-Year Institutions Using Alternative Definitions of Transfer Does the composition of the group of potential transfer students change as the definitions become more restrictive? Restricting the group of potential transfer students according to these definitions may alter the composition of the group, since these educational characteristics are themselves associated with other background variables (Berkner, Cuccaro-Alamin, and McCormick 1996). Across increasingly restrictive definitions of potential transfer, the percentage of the pool that was in the highest socioeconomic status (SES) quartile increased from 30 percent of all beginning community college students to 51 percent of beginning community college students with an academic major and taking courses leading toward a bachelor's degree. Furthermore, none of the students in this particular sample who met the most restrictive definition of potential transfer were Black, compared to 6 to 10 percent Black students in each of the other potential transfer groups.* In general, restricting the pool of potential transfer students systematically altered the composition of the group to include more traditional students (younger, dependent students who do not work full time). What percentage of students with different characteristics meets each potential transfer definition? In addition to examining how the composition of the population of potential transfer students changed as the *This does not necessarily mean, however, that there are no Black students in the population of community college students who would meet this definition.  definitions became more restrictive, the report also compares the likelihood of meeting each definition of potential transfer across various subgroups of students. For example, students 22 years or older were generally less likely than younger students to meet the various definitions of potential transfer. In general, the higher the SES, the higher the percentage of students who met the criteria for each specification. Students who reported taking at least 1 credit hour of remedial mathematics instruction during 1989-90 were generally about as likely to fit each definition as students who did not take any remedial mathematics instruction. Students who were enrolled full time were generally more likely to meet the various specifications than those who were enrolled less than full time. Transfer rates for each definition of potential transfer Figure B shows estimated transfer rates for all community college entrants and for the eight increasingly restrictive definitions of potential transfer arranged in order. The results show that, in general, the transfer rate increased for more restrictive definitions. The lowest rate of ever enrolling in a 4-year institution by spring 1994,25 percent, was found for all 1989-90 beginning community college students, compared to 52 percent for students meeting the most restrictive definition (both pursuing an academic major during 1989-90 and taking courses leading toward a bachelor's degree). That is, the transfer rate for the most restrictive definition was at least twice the rate for all students. However, figure C demonstrates that the Figure B.Among 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students enrolled at public 2-year institutions, the percentage who transferred to 4-year institutions by spring 1994,for various definitions of potential transfer percentage of actual transfer students meeting the criteria for inclusion in the denominator declined significantly as the definitions of potential transfer became more restrictive. In other words, attempts to include only those students most likely to transfer actually exclude a sizable proportion of students who transfer anyway, without meeting those criteria. For example, four out of five actual transfer students did not meet the most restrictive definition considered. Additional exploratory analyses examined the percentage of beginning community college students who ever transferred to a 4-year institution for each potential transfer definition, by selected student background characteristics. In several cases, relationships of student characteristics to transfer I rates generally persisted even when the analyses were restricted to students meeting the various potential transfer definitions. For example, in general, the older the age group, the lower the percentage of students who transferred, regardless of the definition of potential transfer that was used. Also, regardless of the potential transfer definition used, higher SES was generally associated with a higher transfer rate.\nA Classification System for 2-Year Postsecondary Institutions Ronald A.

The universe data are from the NCES Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (WEDS).\nCommunity Development and Career Institutions are institutions with an unduplicated headcount of less than 2,000 students. These institutions tend to confer awards and degrees primarily in job and career skills development, and to focus on overall workforce development for the communities they serve. Community Connector Institutions are institutions with an unduplicated headcount of 2,000 to 9,999 students. These institutions tend to confer awards and degrees that target job and career skills development, and to offer academic programs with some component of general education that can facilitate transfer to 4-year institutions. Community Mega-Connector Institutions are institutions with an unduplicated headcount of at least 10,000 students. These institutions tend to be in urban locations, to confer awards and degrees that target job and career skills development, and to offer academic programs with some component of general education that can facilitate transfer to 4-year institutions. Private not-for-profit institutions The percentage of total awards granted that are in allied health programs is the distinguishing characteristic of private not-for-profit 2-year institutions. Two categories were created within this sector: Allied Health Institutions are institutions that grant 100 percent of their awards in allied health programs. These institutions tend to be small in enrollment and to have an exclusive focus on allied health training. Connector Institutions are institutions that grant less than 100 percent of their awards in allied health programs. These institutions tend to confer awards and degrees that target job and career skills development, and to offer academic programs with some component of general education that can facilitate transfer to 4-year institutions. Private for-profit institutions A distinguishing characteristic of private for-profit 2-year institutions is the percentage of total awards granted that are certificates. Below is a description of the two categories within this sector: Career Connector Institutions are institutions that grant less than 100 percent of their awards as certificates. They are degree-granting institutionsalthough many also offer certificatesthat target job and career skills development. Many of these institutions offer academic programs with some component of general education that can facilitate transfer to 4-year institutions. Institutions are institutions that grant 100 percent of their awards as certificates.

For over 30 years, NAEP has been the only ongoing national indicator of what American students know and can do in major academic subjects. In 2000, NAEP administered a mathematics assessment to a national sample representative of all students at grades 4, 8, and 12. In addition, state-level results were collected at grades 4 and 8. The findings from the NAEP 2000 Mathematics Assessment provide a picture of U.S. students' mathematics knowledge, skills, and achievement. This 16-page publication uses a full-color tabloid format to present highlights from the 2000 mathematics assessment. It describes the assessment content, presents major findings, and provides information  1990, 1992, and 1996. The publication also includes sample test questions and examples of student responses.

In both 1996 and 2000, the NAEP mathematics assessment collected the two sets of results separately. At grades 4 and 8, there were no significant differences between the two sets in either 1996 or 2000. At grade 12, there was no significant difference between the two sets in 2000. States, districts, and even schools are all grappling with the issue of including more special-needs students in assessments as well as in regular classrooms. Everyone knows this is a good idea, but the issue of accountability in assessing these students is complex. As NAEP continues to model 18 , 0 inclusion and accommodation, perhaps this process will affirm the value of including special-needs students and dispel the uncertainty about how this inclusion will affect the reported results."}, {"section_title": "Implications of Information About Technology Use", "text": "Many implications can be drawn from the information gained from questionnaires completed by students, teachers, and school administrators. \"NAEP examines the relationship between selected contextual variables drawn from these questionnaires and students' average scores on the mathematics assessment.

I would like to examine several relationships between questionnaire responses and student performance in the light of my experiences as an eighth-grade mathematics teacher. My focus will be on the use of technology."}, {"section_title": "Use of computers", "text": "As computers become more and more a part of our work and personal lives, questions arise as to how much computers should be used in school, in what ways computers should be used, and whether computer use has an impact on student learning. Certainly, computers are increasingly available in classrooms at each grade level. The Mathematics 2000 report states that the availability of computers in classrooms increased by at least 20 percentage points from 1996 to 2000, although the availability of computer labs did not change significantly during this period. Unfortunately, comparing the increase of computers in the classroom to student scores is not encouraging. There is not a direct relationship between the availability of computers in students' classrooms and increases in mathematics achievement. I concur with these findings. Yes, I have two computers in my classroom, compared to none in 1996. But I have little mathematical software and relatively unreliable Internet access. Without a projector, it is almost impossible to effectively use two computers in a classroom with 30 NATIONAL CENTER FOR EDUCATION STATISTICS students. Also, with only 44 minutes for each class, it is difficult to give students time to use the computer. Not surprisingly, teachers responding to the NAEP questionnaires quite often reported that computers were either not used at all or used primarily for math learning games or drill. What are the implications? By themselves, computers in classrooms or labs are not going to make a difference in the amount or type of mathematics learned. Teachers need ongoing training and support in using the computer as an instructional tool. They need software and hardware, which unfortunately are often expensive, hard to find, and difficult to use. In this high-tech world, it is imperative to give students the opportunity to use computers in school. The issue is, how can computers be used to increase students' achievement in mathematics? I believe that access to and effective use of computers in schools is essential in closing the gap between those students who use technology efficiently and those students who are technologically deficient or deprived."}, {"section_title": "Use of calculators", "text": "Regarding the issue of how calculator use in the classroom relates to student performance, the results of the 2000 mathematics assessment are more encouraging and clearer as to what works and what doesn't. The proper role of calculators in the K-12 mathematics curriculum has been and continues to be debated. Calculator-use policies vary across districts and schools; even within the same school, teachers have different opinions about how calculators should be integrated with instruction. States are also deciding if, how, and when calculators should be allowed on state assessments. At grade 4, more frequent use of calculators for mathematics activities, as reported by students, was linked to lower scores. This information seems to confirm the need for caution in the use of calculators at grade 4. Since students in elementary school are still becoming fluent in computing whole numbers, calculators need to be used more for exploring and deepening the understanding of number sense. At grades 8 and 12, the implications are much clearer. For example, using a calculator in the eighth grade appears to benefit mathematics achievement. At grade 8, daily calculator use for mathematics activities, as reported by both students and teachers, was associated with the highest scores. In fact, teachers who permitted unrestricted use of calculators and those who permitted calculator use on tests had eighth-graders with higher average scores. EVen the type of calculator that students reported using was directly related to how they performed on the mathematics assessment. Eighth-graders who used a scientific calculator scored higher than their peers who did not use one, and the same was true of eighth-graders who used a graphing calculator compared to their peers who did not. Between 1996 and 2000, the percentages of eighth-graders who reported using scientific and graphing calculators increased. Many states do allow some calculator use on grade 8 state assessments. Again, it is important for teachers not only to have access to calculators, but also to have training in how to effectively use them. The key is teaching students to use calculators as a tool and giving students calculator tasks and assessments. I know that using graphing calculators with my eighth-grade students is extremely motivating and really works best for exploring patterns or making predictions. At grade 12, daily use of calculators was again associated with the highest scores. The type of calculator used was important, with those twelfth-graders who reported using a graphing calculator scoring an average of 25 scale-score points higher than those who did not. Though it could be argued that twelfth-graders who use graphing calculators have higher scores because they have taken more advanced mathematics courses, I contend that being able to efficiently use a graphing calculator could make the advanced mathematics courses more accessible to all students. There are a couple of implications regarding graphing calculators. Allowing or even requiring the use of graphing calculators on state assessments has a direct effect on the number of graphing calculators in the classroom and the amount of time that they are used in classroom instruction. I have seen this happen in Texas, where the state's end-ofcourse exam in Algebra I requires the use of graphing calculators. These calculators are expensive, however, and states or districts need to provide funding for purchasing these calculators and for training teachers to effectively use them."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In conclusion, there is much to be learned from the results of the NAEP 2000 Mathematics Assessment and from comparing these results to those of past assessments. Lots of people, especially local administrators and teachers, are not knowledgeable about NAEP. I believe that since districts and schools do not receive individual student scores, many educators conclude that the informatiOn is not relevant. I beg to differ. In addition to the implications that I have already discussed, the information in NAEP reports has many other important implications for state, district, and school policies. How much homework to assign, what types of mathematics courses to offer or require, and what courses teachers need for certificationthese are all examples of policies for which NAEP could have implications. The results of the NAEP assessments can help educators and policymakers make better decisions.\nThe findings of this study demonstrated a consistent advantage experienced by students who completed rigorous high school curricula, and to a lesser extent by those completing mid-level curricula, over their peers completing core curricula or lower. However, the level of high school curricula students reported completing also was related to their family background characteristics and indicators of socioeconomic status, including family income, parents' education, race/ethnicity, and the economic status of their high school's student body. All of these factors relate to whether or not students have the opportunities to participate in and complete rigorous curricula. Moreover, students' success in staying in college was also related to where they first enrolled and how well they did in their first year. Yet, even when all these factors were taken into consideration, the advantage of completing a rigorous high school academic curriculum remained. The same was not observed for levels of SAT scores. Similar to the findings for curriculum levels, SAT scores were related to persistence when first-year college GPA was not included in the regression. However, after GPA was added, high school curriculum remained a significant factor, but SAT scores did not. These findings are consistent with recent research based on high school transcripts for a cohort of 1980 high school sophomores (Adelman 1999); this study demonstrated that high school curriculum was a stronger predictor of bachelor's degree attainment than standardized test scores or other measures of high school academic performance. Perhaps most notable in the current study is the apparent benefit of a strong high school academic curriculum for transfer students. Students who transfer from their initial 4-year college may do so because they are struggling either academically or socially, and attempting to find a better fit in another institution. One-fifth of 1995-96 beginning undergraduates enrolled in 4-year colleges had transferred from their first institution by 1998. For these students in particular, as their level of high school academic curriculum increased, so did their likelihood of staying on track to a bachelor's degree (by transferring to another 4-year institution without a break in enrollment)."}, {"section_title": "20", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "22", "text": "Using state-level results from 1990 or 1992 to 2000, states can track their own progress or look at other states that have shown dramatic increases in mathematics achievement. Mathematics learning and achievement can be affected by state policies on recommended textbooks, state curriculum guidelines, assessments, course requirements for students, and teacher certification requirements. Investigating a state's policies and the implementation of these policies over the past 8 to 10 years may provide insight about what it takes to improve mathematics achievement. Introduction As we move into the 21st century our nation looks to its youth for confirmation that the government established over 200 years ago will remain relevant, vital, and strong. We expect that today's students are being prepared to understand and maintain the values of our democratic society Civics education in our nation's schools informs students about the structures, functions, and processes of government and about the meaningful ways in which citizens can make decisions about public issues and participate in governance. This report, based on findings from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), provides a view of students' achievement in civics over the 10-year period from 1988 to 1998. The data and 48,4   EDUCATION STATISTICS QUARTERLY  VOLUME 3, ISSUE 3, FALL 2001 information provided give some indication as to whether there have been changes in students' understanding of civics and whether civics education has changed during the last decade of the 20th century NAEP is the nation's only ongoing survey of what students know and can do in various academic subject areas. Authorized by Congress and administered by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the U.S. Department of Education, NAEP regularly reports to the public on the educational progress of students in grades 4, 8, and 12. In 1998, NAEP conducted two national assessments of students' civics knowledge in each of these grades. One of the 1998 civics assessments was entirely new, employing a new set of test specifications (or \"framework\"). The results of this new assessment were not comparable to those of the 1988 assessment. The other 1998 civics assessment (based on the 1988 test objectives) was a special study that repeated a number of the multiple-choice test questions used in 1988. The results of the new assessment were reported in the fall of 1999 as the NAEP 1998 Civics Report Card for the Nation (Lutkus et al. 1999). The results of the special study are reported here as a summary of trends in students' knowledge and teachers' classroom practices over the 10-year period. The results are based on the assessment of a sample of students at each grade that is statistically representative of the entire nation. Students' performance is described in terms of average percentage correct, rather than the traditional NAEP scale scores. The reason for this departure is that the relatively small set of test questions repeated from 1988 in grades 8 and 12 did not allow comprehensive coverage of the 1988 test objectives, nor did it allow the reliable development of scale scores parallel to those used in 1988. This report provides results for subgroups of students defined by various background and contextual characteristics. The analyses focus on differences between 1988 and 1998, rather than differences among groups within each year. To illustrate the civics knowledge that was assessed, the report provides numerous samples of the test questions. The report also explores trends in the classroom coverage of civics topics from 1988 to 1998, as well as trends in classroom instructional activities over the decade.

Brian Ray, president of the National Home Education Research Institute, estimated the number of homeschoolers to be around 1.15 million during the 1996-97 school year, and predicted that the number would grow to at least 1.3 million during 1999-2000 (Ray 1997). Patricia M. Lines, through her research at the U.S. Department of Education, National Institute on Student Achievement, Curriculum, and Assessment, estimated the number of homeschoolers to be around 700,000 during 1995-96, possibly growing to 1 million by 1997-98 (Lines 1999). Both Ray and Lines grant that their estimates probably anchor the range within which the actual number of homeschoolers could fall. The methods used by Ray and Lines in the development of their estimates varied. Ray derived his most recent estifnate of the number of homeschoolers using his own 1995 survey of homeschoolers and their use of curricular packages as his base and sales of homeschooling curricular packages to adjust for growth over time. Ray applied the ratio of users of curricular packages and nonusers identified in the 1995 survey to more recent sales of homeschool curricular packages to obtain his 1999-2000 estimate. Lines collected data from all states that obtained records on homeschooling children in both the 1990-91 and 1995-96 school years (32 states and the District of Columbia). Using the 12 states with high record-collection rates for homeschoolers, based on Ray's estimates of the percentage of homeschoolers who reported filing in their state, Lines estimated the percentage of school-aged children who were homeschooling in those 12 states. Lines estimated the number of children homeschooled nationally by applying the percentage distribution of homeschoolers from the state sample to national totals of school-aged children. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) was the first organization to attempt to estimate the number of homeschoolers in the United States using a rigorous sample survey of households. A household sampling frame circumvents problems inherent in the use of incomplete sample frames, such as customers of curricular providers and administrative records. Attempts to develop estimates of homeschoolers through household surveys, however, can also be problematic. The first two efforts to estimate homeschoolers at NCESthrough the October supplement to the 1994 Current Population Survey (CPS:0ct94) and through the Parent and Family Involvement in Education/ Civic Involvement Survey of the National Household Education Surveys Program, 1996(PFI/CI-NHES:1996 produced very different estimates. One problem that may have contributed to the varying estimates was the difference in how the two surveys identified students who were both homeschooled and enrolled in school part time. Neither survey collected precise data on these part-time homeschoolers. An NCES technical report, Issues Related to Estimating the Home-Schooled Population in the United States With National Household Survey Data, explores in detail the differences in survey design and execution that may have contributed to the disparity between the CPS:0ct94 and PFI/CI-NHES:1996 estimates (Henke et al. 2000). In this report, the Parent Survey of the National Household Education Surveys Program, 1999(Parent-NHES:1999) is used to estimate the number of homeschoolers in the United States, to describe the characteristics of homeschoolers, and to document parents' reasons for homeschooling and parents' reports of public school support for homeschoolers. Students were considered to be homeschooled if their parents reported them being schooled at home instead of at a public or private school, if their enrollment in public or private schools did not exceed 25 hours a week, and if they were not being homeschooled solely because of a temporary illness. The unweighted number of homeschooled students used in this analysis is 275 and the unweighted number of nonhomeschooled students is 16,833. Students are defined in this report as children ages 5 to 17 with a grade equivalent of kindergarten through grade 12.\nOver the past quarter-century, Black Americans have made important gains in narrowing the gaps in educational and economic performance between themselves and Whites. Between 1973 and 1996, for example, average scores of Black 17-year-olds on the mathematics portion of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) grew by 6 percent, while average scores of White 17-year-olds remained about the same (Snyder, Hoffman, and Geddes 1997). Black-White gaps in NAEP reading scores also narrowed over this period. Further, in 1974, the high school dropout rate for 15-through 24-year-old Blacks was twice the corresponding rate for Whites; but by 1997, Blacks and Whites in this age bracket remained in high school at similar rates (National Center for Education Statistics 1999). Despite progress in reducing Black-White gaps in mathematics and reading achievement, Blacks have continued to 106 -6 score lower on NAEP than Whites (Snyder, Hoffman, and Geddes 1997). And, despite the convergence in high school completion rates of Blacks and Whites, the Black-White gap in 4-year college completion rates of high school graduates 25-29 years old has increased slightly over the past quartercentury. Between 1975 and, this gap increased from 13 to 17 percentage points (National Center for Education Statistics 1999). In recent years, Black-White disparities have also persistedand have sometimes grown largerfor labor market outcomes such as labor force participation,2 unemployment,3 and hourly wages. Between 1973 and 1993, Black-White differences in the labor force participation rates of 25-through 34-year-olds widened by 3.4 percentage points for men and 19 percentage points for women, and the corresponding Black-White gaps in unemployment rates widened by about 2.4 percentage points for both men and women. Over the same time period, the Black-White gap in hourly wages narrowed by one-third for 25-through 34-year-old men, but more than doubled for 25-through 34-year-old women (Bernstein 1995). Recent studies have revealed a strong relationship between differences in prior educational achievement and Black-White disparities in college attendance and earnings. With Black-White disparities remaining in both educational and economic outcomes, it is important to understand the relationship between educational achievement during elementary and secondary school and subsequent academic and labor market performance.\nA well-known classification system for higher education in the United States was developed by the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education. Originally published in 1973and refined and updated in 1976Originally published in 1973and refined and updated in , 1987Originally published in 1973and refined and updated in , 1994 Carnegie classification system divides colleges and universities into categories based on their degree-granting activity (doctoral, master's, baccalaureate, and associate's). In addition, the Carnegie classification system identifies myriad \"specialized institutions,\" such as theological seminaries, schools of law, teachers colleges, and medical schools. A limitation of the Carnegie classification system is how 2-year institutions are categorized. While there are six distinct subcategories for 4-year institutions, the 2000 Carnegie classification system places the 1,669 institutions that offer associate of arts degrees or certificates andwith few exceptionsoffer no baccalaureate degrees into a single grouping, Associate's Colleges (The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching 2000). This single grouping of institutions accounts for more institutions than Doctoral/Research Universities, Master's Colleges and Universities, and Baccalaureate Colleges combined (1,478). Furthermore, the Carnegie classification includes only accredited and degree-granting institutions, excluding over 700 of the 2,427 2-year institutions with participation agreements for Title IV student aid funds, as found in the 1997-98 \"Institutional Characteristics Survey\" of the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (1PEDS) database. About half of all students in postsecondary education are enrolled in 2-year institutions.' Placing all 2-year institutions into one category, thereby masking their differences, has limited the understanding of this crucial segment of higher education. While community colleges and other 2-year institutions often share a commitment to open access, comprehensiveness, and/or responsiveness to local 'This enrollment information is based on the NCES 1995-96 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:96), Data Analysis System. 126 needs, these unique American inventions are in fact a disparate group of institutions.

An extensive 1998 study of homeschoolers, although based on a convenience sample, suggests that homeschoolers differ from the general population in parents' educational attainment, household income, parents' marital status, and family size (Rudner 1999).' Other research suggests that although homeschooling in the United States may once have been primarily a trend within a homogeneous subgroup of White, middle-class, Christian families, growth in homeschooling may be reaching a broader range of American families and values (McDowell, Sanchez, and Jones 2000;Lines 2000a;Welner and Welner 1999). The Parent-NHES:1999 provides descriptive data about the characteristics of homeschoolers in the United States and their families. This report includes students who were homeschooled only and students who were homeschooled and enrolled in school for 25 hours or less per week. As shown in table 1, about four out of five homeschoolers were homeschooled only (82 percent) and one out of five homeschoolers were enrolled in public or private schools part time (18 percent). Table 2 shows the number of all students by selected characteristics, the number of homeschooled students by those same characteristics, and for each characteristic the percentage of students who are homeschooled. As shown in table 2, the percentage of students who were homeschooled in 1999 differed based on various characteristics of students and their families. Depending on these student and family characteristics, the percentage of homeschoolers among students ranged from 0.7 to 4.6 percent. Characteristics that distinguished high percentages of homeschooling were twoparent families, especially when only one parent participated in the labor force; large family size; and parents' high educational attainment. The percentage of students who were homeschooled was similar for both boys and girls; across elementary, middle, and high school grades; and across the four income ranges used in the analysis. Table 3 further explores the characteristics that distinguish homeschoolers by comparing the characteristics of homeschoolers to those nf all students and to the characteristics of nonhomeschoolers. The similarities and differences 1Rudner's study is based on a survey administered by Bob Jones University to a sample drawn from parents who used the university's standardized testing program (Weiner and Weiner 19991."}, {"section_title": "between homeschoolers and nonhomeschoolers are discussed in detail below", "text": "Grade equivalent of homeschooled students Homeschoolers distribute over the grade groupings in much the same way as nonhomeschoolers (table 3).

The Parent-NHES:1999 shows the percentage of homeschooled students living in two-parent households was much higher than the percentage for nonhomeschoolers-80 percent of homeschooled students lived in two-parent families compared to 66 percent for nonhomeschoolers.

Previous studies suggest that the most common reasons that parents give for homeschooling their children are moral or religious reasons, a desire for high educational achievement, dissatisfaction with public schools' instructional program, and concerns about school environment, including safety, drugs, and peer pressure (Lines 2000a;Grubb 1998;Mayberry 1991).

In each household, up to two children may have been sampled for the survey. In the Parent-NHES:1999, there were 30 households in which parents completed interviews about two homeschooled children.

Previous research found that only a small percentage of homeschoolers enrolled in classes, used textbooks, or used libraries when they were made available by public schools and that many homeschoolers express antipathy toward using public school support (Lines 2000b;Yeager 1999;Mayberry et al. 1995).    Sprinthall 1996). Formal professional development as commonly practiced, typically consisting of school and district staff development programs, however, has been criticized for being short term and lacking in continuity and adequate follow-up (Fullan 1991;Lewis et al. 1999;Mullens et al. 1996).  For all but one content area of professional development, teachers typically reported that they had spent 1 to 8 hours, or the equivalent of 1 day or less, on the activity during the 12 months preceding the survey (table A). In-depth study in the subject area of the main teaching assignment was the only area of professional development in which participation typically lasted more than 8 hours. The number of hours teachers spent in professional development activities was related to the extent to which they believed that participation improved their teaching.

This activity was followed by networking with teachers outside their school (62 percent), a common planning period for team teachers (53 percent), and individual or collaborative research on a topic of professional 34 3 6 interest (52 percent). Teachers were least likely to mentor another teacher in a formal relationship (26 percent) or to be mentored by another teacher (23 percent). Frequency of participation in a collaborative activity was generally positively related to teachers' beliefs about the extent to which the activity improved their classroom teaching. For example, teachers who engaged in regularly scheduled collaboration with other teachers at least once a week were more likely to believe that participation had improved their teaching a lot (45 percent), compared with teachers who participated two to three times a month (23 percent), once a month (15 percent), or a few times a year (7 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Teachers' feelings of preparedness", "text": "Teachers in the 2000 survey reported the extent to which they felt prepared for the overall demands of their teaching assignments and for eight specific classroom activities.

This was an increase of almost 7 percent over the more than 86,000 schools reported 5 years earlier, in the fall of 1994.2 Most of these were regular schools, those that offer a comprehensive curriculum and may provide other programs and services as well. A smaller number of schools focused primarily on special education, vocational/technical education, or alternative programs. Students in these specialized schools were often enrolled in a regular school as well, and reported only with the membership of that regular school (table A). Among the schools that reported students in membership, almost 94 percent were regular schools (table 1). The second largest category with student membership was that of alternative education schools (4 percent), followed by special education schools (about 2 percent).

In the 1998-99 school year, the CCD began reporting schools operated by the U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the domestic Department of Defense Dependents Schools as separate entries, and they are not included in the U.S. totals shown in the tables in this report. Some, but not all, of these BIA and Department of Defense schools previously were included in the states within whose boundaries they were located. Most local education agencies are those that are typically thought of as \"school districts.\" Operated by a local school board, they provide instructional services for students and comprised almost 89 percent of local agencies in 1999-2000 (table 2). A smaller proportion, about 8 percent, were supervisory unions or regional education service agencies whose major responsibility is to offer administrative, special program, testing, or other services to school districts. Finally, around 4 percent of the reported agencies were operated directly by a state or federal government or were other than any of the preceding categories. The number of regular school districts increased by 1 percent from the 14,772 reported in 1994 to a total of 14,928 in 1999-2000. The governance of charter schools varies from state to state. In some cases, they are not considered under the administration of the regular public school district within whose boundaries they operate and are reported on the CCD with       a separate education agency for each charter school. When this occurs, the districts are reported under the category of \"other education agency\" For example, although not all states designate a separate agency for each charter school, in the District of Columbia the establishment of 27 charter schools explains why the District is shown with 28 local education agencies in table 2."}, {"section_title": "Student Membership", "text": "In the 1999-2000 school year, 89,599 public schools provided instruction to 46.9 million students in the United States (table 1), an increase of less than 1 percent over the 46.5 million students in 1998 (Hoffman 2000, table 1). Five states (California, Florida, Illinois, New York, and Texas) enrolled more than 2 million students in their public schools. At the other end of the size distribution, the District of Columbia and Wyoming reported fewer than 100,000 students.

Middle schools, those with grade spans ranging from as low as grade 4 to as high as grade 9, made up almost 18 percent of schools with students. High schools (low grade of 7 or higher, high grade of 12) were another 19 percent of schools. Some 5 percent of schools had a grade configuration that did not fit into any of these three categories. A total of 14,571 regular school districts reported students in membership for 1999-2000 (table 4). As with schools, grade span categories were assigned by the lowest and highest grades offered. Approximately 73 percent of school districts included the range of grades from prekindergarten or kindergarten to 9 or higher, and they accounted for 92 percent of all public school students. (In fact, only in Arizona, Illinois, Montana, and Vermont did as many as one-third of the students attend school districts with other grade spans.) A little less than 6 percent of students were in districts going no higher than grade 8, and about 2 percent were in secondary districts with no grade lower than 7.

In the District of Columbia, charter schools accounted for more than 8 percent of public school enrollment, more than double the proportion reported for any state.

Fifteen states and the District of Columbia reported that they did not have magnet schools, and 18 of those states with magnet schools were unable to identify them. Table 9 lists the number of magnet schools for the 17 states that reported this information. California and Illinois reported the greatest number of magnet schools, 473 and 350, respectively. Illinois serves about 12 percent of its students in magnet schools; in California, the figure is about 9 percent.

This report examines the relationship between high school academic curricula and students' persistence path through college, approximately 3 years after first enrolling. The data are drawn from the 1996 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:96/98), a study of beginning postsecondary students who first enrolled in a 4-year college in 1995-96. Measures of high school academic preparation are based on academic courses taken in high school as reported by students on their college entrance exam applications. The high school academic curriculum measure identifies three levels of coursetaking: (1) core curriculum or below, based on the core New Basics curriculum first recommended by the National Commission on Excellence in Education in A Nation at Risk (1983). Core curriculum includes 4 years of English, 3 years of mathematics, 3 years of science, and 3 years of social studies.' The highest threshold, or rigorous curriculum, identified in the current study, includes 4 years of English, 3 years of a foreign language, 3 years of social studies, 4 years of mathematics (including precalculus or higher), 3 years of science (including biology, chemistry, and physics), and at least one Advanced Placement (AP) course or test taken. Mid-level covers curricula between core and rigorous curricula, but at a minimum must include algebra 1, geometry, at least 1 year of a foreign language, and two science classes from the combination of biology, chemistry, and physics.' 1It also included courses in computer science, but students did not report on such courses on their entrance exam applications. 2The research of Burkam, Lee, and Smerdon (1996) and Adelman (1999) was used extensively in guiding the development of the academic curriculum variable."}, {"section_title": "66", "text": "6 7"}, {"section_title": "Level of High School Academic Curriculum Completed", "text": "The distribution of beginning students enrolled in 4-year institutions across the three levels of coursetaking is displayed in figure A. Approximately one-third (31 percent) reported completing course work no higher than core curricula, one-half completed mid-level curricula, and the remaining one-fifth (19 percent) completed rigorous curricula. The level of high school academic curriculum completed by beginning 4-year college students was associated with their demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and also with the economic status of the student body in their high schools. Specifically, students from low-income families, students whose parents had no more than a high school education, and students who graduated from high schools in which 25 percent or more of the students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches were less likely than their more advantaged counterparts to report completing rigorous high school curricula. 2Mid-level curriculum exceeds core curriculum, but is less than rigorous.

The level of college students' high school curricula was strongly related to their persistence in postsecondary education. This was true both for maintaining enrollment at their initial institution (institutional retention) and, if they transferred, staying on track to a bachelor's degree.4 For example, 79 percent of students who had participated in rigorous high school academic curricula were continuously enrolled in their initial institution (including 1 percent who had attained a bachelor's degree; figure C). In contrast, 62 percent and 55 percent, respectively, of those in mid-level curricula or core curricula or lower were continuously enrolled in their initial institution. Students in rigorous curricula also were less likely to transfer from their first institution (13 percent) than those who participated in less than rigorous curricula, whether in mid-level or core or lower curricula (23 percent of both groups transferred). 4The\"persistence track\"to a bachelor's degree is defined as maintaining uninterrupted enrollment in a 4-year institution toward a bachelor's degree objective. It includes those who transfer between 4-year institutions without a break in enrollment.The persistence track concept was first developed by Carroll (1989) to demonstrate the optimal path to a bachelor's degree and the adverse effects of straying from the path. The difference between levels of academic curricula was especially notable with respect to staying on track to a bachelor's degree (i.e., continuous enrollment in any 4-year institution). As the level of academic curricula increased, so did the proportion of undergraduates who stayed on track ( figure D). As of 1998, the vast majority (87 percent) of those who had participated in rigorous high school academic curricula were still on track to a bachelor's degree, compared with 71 percent of those in mid-level curricula and 62 percent of those who completed core curricula or lower. Correspondingly, the proportion of those who had left postsecondary education and did not return declined with each successive level of academic curriculum (from 17 percent to 10 percent to 4 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Patterns of Transfer", "text": "The rate of transfer for those who completed no higher than a core curriculum in high school was the same as for those who completed mid-level curricula.

However, as shown in figure E, among students who transferred, as their level of academic curricula increased, so did the likelihood of staying on track to a bachelor's degree (i.e., they transferred to another 4-year institution without a break in enrollment). For those who had completed core curricula or lower, 31 percent of transfers stayed on the bachelor's degree track, as did 39 percent of transfers who had completed mid-level curricula and 60 percent of those who had completed rigorous high school curricula. These differences were clearly evident when examining the destination of transfers. Staying on track to a bachelor's degree implies staying enrolled in a 4-year institution, so all transfers who stayed on track transferred to 4-year institutions. However, there were also differences across high school academic curricula with respect to the selectivity of the 4-year institutions where students transferred (table A). Among all transfers who completed rigorous high school curricula, 40 percent transferred to selective institutions, compared with just 21 percent of their counterparts who completed mid-level curricula and 17 percent who completed core curricula or lower. Correspondingly, transfers who completed rigorous curricula were much less likely to transfer either to a less-than-4-year or a for-profit institution (21 percent) than their counterparts in mid-level (40 percent) or core curricula or lower (46 percent). Examining the selectivity of students' first institution compared with their second, the likelihood of making a lateral transfer from selective to selective institution was much higher for those completing rigorous high school curricula (49 percent) than for those completing either midlevel curricula (33 percent) or no higher than core curricula (22 percent). Similarly, the likelihood of transferring from a selective institution to a less-than-4-year or for-profit institution was much lower for those completing rigorous curricula (19 percent) than for their counterparts completing mid-level curricula (40 percent) or no higher than core curricula (47 percent). While the patterns of transfer appear to be similar among those who began in less-selective institutions (i.e., those completing rigorous high school curricula were more likely than those in less rigorous curricula to transfer to selective institutions or to transfer laterally, and less likely to transfer to less-than-4-year or for-profit institutions), there is not enough statistical evidence to draw this conclusion.

However, once GPA was taken into account, high school academic curriculum remained a significant predictor of persistence (specifically, completing a rigorous versus core or lower curriculum), but the association between levels of SAT scores and persistence disappeared. In other words, once all related variables were taken into consideration, including college GPA, entrance exam scores were no longer associated with the likelihood of persisting, either with respect to institutional retention or staying on track to a bachelor's degree. Other variables were also significantly associated with both measures of persistence after holding related variables consistent. For example, students whose parents did not attend college were less likely to persist than those whose parents were college educated.6 In addition, students who started college attending part time and/or working full time were less likely to persist than their counterparts, as were those who first enrolled in lessselective 4-year institutions compared with those in selective institutions. 6A recent NCES report provides a detailed analysis of the experiences of\"firstgeneration\" college students-those whose parents did not attend college (Warburton, Bugarin, and Nufiez 2001 "}, {"section_title": "72", "text": "\nTaken together, the results suggest that completing a rigorous academic curriculum in high school may help students overcome socioeconomic disadvantages such as low family income and parents with no college experience, as well as helping those who get a poor start in college (whether academic or social) and decide to transfer.

Even among those qualified for college, firstgeneration students were less likely to enroll in 4-year institutions (Horn and Nunez 2000). Independent of other relevant demographic, enrollment, and college involvement factors, first-generation status was also found to be negatively associated with students' persistence and attainment (Nunez and Cuccaro-Alamin 1998)."}, {"section_title": "AC21 P771(7 ir", "text": "What has not been well understood, however, is the extent to which the academic preparation of first-generation students in high school affects their persistence and attainment in postsecondary education.

Which definition (or definitions) is (are) most appropriate for addressing a specific research question? The decision is not straightforward. This report illustrates the trade-off between restricting the pool of potential transfer students and excluding substantial portions of the initial cohort. For example, including only students who have an academic major and are taking courses leading toward a bachelor's degree results in a high transfer rate (52 percent), but no more than about 1 in 10 community college students meets this definition, and it excludes 4 out of 5 transfer students. Restricting the pool to the 71 percent of students who expect to earn a bachelor's degree or higher yields a transfer rate of 36 percent, but fully 95 percent of all transfers have this expectation. Just as any statistic depends on the specific variables used to indicate the underlying concepts, the transfer rate for community college students is sensitive to the specification of potential transfer. The most complete picture is provided by using multiple indicators, but this approach is not always practical. If data collection costs or other constraints only permit one definition, one strategy is to define the group of potential transfer students broadly enough that it still reflects community college students somewhat generally, while not so broadly as to include students who never harbor plans to transfer to a 4-year college. The results of this study present several alternatives with different advantages and disadvantages. Overall, the results provide national estimates of community college students' academic expectations and transfer activity. These estimates refine and update our understanding of students' intentions and paths to transfer. Selecting an approach to defining potential transfer is a necessary first step in any effort to analyze the impact of institution type on persistence and attainment. This report has taken a step back and analyzed the definition itself by examining several alternative approaches using a complete nationally representative sample. While the results do not demonstrate the superiority of any single definition, they sharpen one's appreciation for the consequences of measurement decisions and build a firmer foundation for future work on this population."}, {"section_title": "SOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 1996 Beginning Postsecondary Students", "text": "Longitudinal Study,\"First Follow-up\" (BPS:96/98). higher were more likely to stay on the persistence track to a bachelor's degree than first-generation students. At the same time, after holding all other variables constant, students who took rigorous coursework in high school significantly increased their chances of staying on the persistence track to a bachelor's degree. Taken together, these results suggest that, while first-generation status is an important predictor of success in postsecondary education, rigorous preparation in high school substantially narrows the gap in postsecondary outcomes between first-generation students and their peers whose parents graduated from college. The need for financial aid or other financial help, such as tuition tax credits, to assist students from middle income families to attend the college of their choice has received increased attention recently. This report provides a profile of middle income undergraduates in comparison to their lower income and higher income counterparts and examines where middle income students enroll by price of attendance and how they and their families pay for college, including the role of financial aid. The source of data for this analysis was the 1995-96 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:96). The report is limited to full-time, full-year (FTFY) dependent undergraduates who were enrolled during 1995-96. In this report, middle income undergraduates are defined as those with family incomes between $35,000 and $69,999 in 1994, the year of the income data included in the NPSAS:96 database. Undergraduates from families with incomes below $35,000 are defined as lower income, and those from families with incomes of $70,000 or more are defined as higher income. Thirty-seven percent of FTFY dependent undergraduates in the sample were middle income according to this definition, 35 percent were lower income, and 28 percent were higher income. Because the financing strategies that students use to pay for college vary by price of attendance, results are provided for four price-of-attendance levels: lowest price of attendance (less than $6,000), moderate price of attendance ($6,000 to $8,499), upper price of attendance ($8,500 to $15,999), and highest price of attendance ($16,000 or more). The price of attendance is the FTFY dependent undergraduate budget, which represents the total expected expenses for an FTFY dependent undergraduate to attend college in 1995-96, including tuition, fees, and nontuition expenses."}, {"section_title": "Profile of Middle Income Full-Time, Full-Year Dependent Undergraduates", "text": "Middle income FTFY dependent undergraduates in 1995-96 were 53 percent female; 81 percent White, non-Hispanic; and nearly all from families with at least three family members.

Middle income FTFY dependent undergraduates with mid-range combined SAT scores of 825-1,199 were less likely to be enrolled at the highest price-of-attendance level than were those with similar SAT scores in the higher income group.

In all three income groups, the percentages of those with SAT scores of 1,200 or more that.were enrolled at the highest price-of-attendance level were not statistically different, standing at 54 percent overall. Multivariate analysis showed that even after controlling for student background and family factors likely to affect enrollment at the highest price-of-attendance level, the percentage enrolled at this level was still lower for middle income FTFY dependent undergraduates (23 percent) than their higher income counterparts (30 percent).

EFC is the amount that the family and the student are expected to contribute toward the price of attendance, based on formulas for calculating financial aid awards.' Virtually all families in the middle income group are expected to pay part of the price of attendance from their own resources. The amount that remains after subtracting EFC is the student's financial need. It is possible that even after all aid is awarded, some students will have unmet need. In 1995-96, four out of five middle income FTFY dependent undergraduates (79 percent) had some financial need, compared with almost all of those in the lower income category (99 percent) and one-third of those in the higher 'Expected family contribution (EFC) is based on dependency,family size, income, assets, and number in college.ln order to calculate how much federal financial aid students can receive, federal regulations provide a methodology that assesses how much the family and the student should contribute toward the price of attendance.

Middle income FTFY dependent undergraduates with financial need had an average of $7,785 of financial need. Sixty-five percent of middle income FTFY dependent undergraduates received financial aid, 55 percent having financial need and 10 percent not having financial need. Overall, middle income FTFY dependent undergraduates had 31 percent of their price of attendance covered by financial aid, and more than one-half (58 percent) had unmet need after financial aid and EFC (table A). One-third of middle income FTFY dependent undergraduates with unmet need had not applied for financial aid. Reasons given included a belief that family income was too high (32 percent) or that the family could afford to pay (48 percent). But for those who did apply for aid, but did not have their financial need met, it could mean that they and their families were making greater financial effort to attend their institution of choice. Net price, or the difference between price of attendance and total financial aid received, is the amount of out-ofpocket expenses that students and their families must come up with to attend the colleges in which they enroll. By examining student earnings and the percentage of students with parents contributing to their college expenses, we can gain an additional perspective on how students and their families cover college expenses. The average net price for middle income FTFY dependent undergraduates in 1995-96 was $7,867 (table A). Net price increased as price-of-attendance level increased, but average student earnings were lowest at the highest price-ofattendance level. At the lowest price-of-attendance level, student earnings for middle income FTFY dependent undergraduates averaged $4,478, the average net price of attendance was $4,581,2 and 84 percent of these students reported that their parents contributed to their college expenses.' At the moderate price-of-attendance level, average student earnings for middle income FTFY dependent undergraduates of $3,737 covered a considerable amount of the $5,668 net price of attendance, while 88 percent of these students reported that their parents contributed to their college expenses. The 'Students are not expected to contribute all of their earnings for EFC or price of attendance.The actual amount contributed from earnings is not known, and some may contribute more or less than calculated for their EFC. 3For students and their families in the middle income group, virtually all are expected to make some contribution from their own resources toward paying for college. amounts of parental contributions toward the net price of attendance are not known, but the data suggest that middle income FTFY dependent undergraduates who were enrolled at the lowest and moderate price-of-attendance levels could meet or exceed the net prices of attendance with their own earnings and a modest contribution from their parents. Perhaps these students attended at the lowest and moderate price-of-attendance levels in order to reduce (but not eliminate) the amount of EFC that their parents needed to contribute, or to increase their available discretionary income, or both. With a sizable gap between average net price ($7,632) and average student earnings ($3,419) for the 49 percent of middle income FTFY dependent undergraduates enrolled at the upper price-of-attendance level, 91 percent reported that their parents contributed toward expenses. EFC for middle income FTFY dependent undergraduates enrolled at this price-of-attendance level was $6,913. Thus, it appears that FTFY undergraduates attending at the upper price-ofattendance level can, on average, meet the net price of attendance through student earnings and parental contributions below EFC. For the 23 percent of middle income FTFY dependent undergraduates enrolled at the highest price-of-attendance level, the gap between net price and student earnings was $8,919, which is more than the average EFC of $7,024 for these undergraduates' families. In addition, student earnings for middle income FTFY dependent undergraduates at the highest price-of-attendance level were lower than earnings for those at other price-of-attendance levels. At the highest price-of-attendance level, 96 percent of parents were reported to contribute to the price of attendance. Again, we do not know the actual amounts contributed by parents, but these data suggest that parents may have contributed amounts that exceeded their EFC by several thousand dollars. This gap between net price, student earnings, and EFC may explain why a smaller percentage of middle income FTFY dependent undergraduates with mid-range SAT scores were enrolled at the highest price-of-attendance level in comparison to those in the higher income group, with more financial resources to meet out-of-pocket expenses. Perhaps middle income parents, on average, made additional financial effort to pay for their dependents who were among the best scholastically, but did not make additional financial effort for those who were mid-range students scholastically. Another reason may be that institutions in the highest priceof-attendance level may not practice need-blind admissions, but balance applicants' academic strengths with their financial aid needs, resulting in fewer enrollees with midrange scores who have higher financial need."}, {"section_title": "Sources of Financial Aid", "text": "In 1995-96, one-half of middle income FTFY dependent undergraduates with financial need received loans, accounting for 42 percent of their aid, while 52 percent received grants, accounting for 44 percent of their aid, with workstudy and other types of aid providing the remaining aid. Institutional grants constituted the most common source of grant aid for middle income FTFY dependent undergraduates with financial need, as well as those in the.higher income group. The percentages of FTFY dependent undergraduates with need who received institutional grants, as well as the average institutional awards that they received, were about the same for each family-income level. In each income category, larger percentages of FTFY dependent undergraduates with need received institutional grants if they were enrolled at the highest price-of-attendance level. At the highest price-of-attendance level, about two-thirds of those with need in the lower and middle income groups received institutional grants, compared with 46 percent of those in the higher income group. In addition, the average award was smaller for those in the higher income group. Institutional grants constituted an important component of financial aid packages that assisted in providing access at the highest price-of-attendance level, especially for lower and middle income undergraduates. Overall, middle income FTFY dependent undergraduates with financial need were about as likely to borrow as their lower income counterparts, and the amounts they borrowed were about the same, but they were more likely to borrow than were their higher income counterparts.

During the last 30 years, women have made great strides in educational attainment, particularly in participating in postsecondary education, where they not only enroll and attain at higher rates than men but also do better academically and have higher educational expectations, on average (National Center for Education Statistics 2000; Berkner, McCormick, and Cuccaro-Alamin 1996;McCormick et al. 1999). However, the superior performance of women at the undergraduate level has not translated into greater enrollment than males at the graduate level or enrollment rates equal to males in all types of graduate programs (McCormick et al. 1999). At the same time that young adults are making decisions about graduate study and employment after earning their bachelor's degree, many are also facing choices about marriage and parenthood. These latter life transitions may play a greater role in women's decisions about schooling and employment at this juncture because women generally marry and have children at younger ages than do men. Thus, choices about getting married and having children may compete with choices about employment and graduate study more for women than for men. This report aims to provide a context for understanding the paths that women and men take toward graduate degrees, employment, marriage, and parenthood during the first 4 years after earning their bachelor's degree. In particular, the analysis seeks to identify how these behaviors are interrelated. This analysis draws upon data from the 1993 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:93/97), which identified students who received their bachelor's degree during academic year 1992-93. The analysis also used follow-up surveys conducted in 1994 and 1997 to trace changes in employment and graduate enrollment, along with changes in marital status and entry into parenthood. In order to obtain complete information about graduates' paths 4 years after degree receipt, this analysis was limited to graduates who responded to the second follow-up survey in 1997. The findings of the report are summarized below."}, {"section_title": "88", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Gender Differences", "text": "Women's and men's characteristics and experiences differed both at the time they received their bachelor's degree and during the next 4 years. Characteristics at bachelor's degree receipt Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients, women differed from men on a number of characteristics, including age, marital and parenthood status, undergraduate major, grade-point average (GPA), and educational aspirations. Compared with men, women were more likely to be under age 23 (51 percent vs. 42 percent) or over age 29 (19 percent vs. 13 percent). They were also more likely than men to have married (29 percent vs. 24 percent) and to have children (16 percent vs. 12 percent) by the time they graduated. With respect to their undergraduate experiences, women were more likely than men to major in certain fields, most notably education (18 percent vs. 6 percent) and health professions (10 percent vs. 4 percent). Men, in contrast, were more likely than women to major in business and management (26 percent vs. 19 percent) and engineering (12 percent vs. 2 percent). Women graduated with higher GPAs than men: 61 percent of women had GPAs of 3.0 or higher, compared with 49 percent of men. Finally, at the time they earned their bachelor's degree, women were more likely than men to expect to earn a graduate degree (87 percent vs. 83 percent). Marital status as well as gender was related to educational plans, with single' women being more likely to expect to earn a graduate degree (89 percent) than married women (83 percent) and both married and single men (82 percent and 84 percent, respectively). Among those expecting to earn a graduate degree, married women were less likely than single women and both married and single men to expect to earn a firstprofessional or doctoral degree (figure A). "}, {"section_title": "Experiences after graduation", "text": "During the first 4 years after graduation, women and men had different experiences with respect to marriage, parenthood, graduate enrollment, graduate attainment, and employment. Among those who had not married by the time they graduated, women were more likely than men to have married within 4 years (32 percent vs. 28 percent) Entry into parenthood occurred at lower rates than marriage. Within 4 years, 13 percent of bachelor's degree recipients who were not parents at graduation became parents. As with marriage, women were more likely than men to make this transition (15 percent vs. 11 percent). After 4 years, 29 percent of bachelor's degree recipients had enrolled in a graduate degree program. While women and men were equally likely to enroll, women were more likely to enroll in master's degree programs and men were more likely to enroll in first-professional and doctoral programs (figure C). Fifteen percent of the 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients earned a graduate degree within 4 years. While women and men were about equally likely to earn a graduate degree within this time frame (16 percent and 15 percent, respectively), among those who did, men were more likely to earn a first-professional or doctoral degree. Among those who earned a graduate degree, 13 percent of women and 23 percent of men earned a first-professional or doctoral degree. Women and men were about equally likely to be employed during the first 4 years after earning their bachelor's degree, but among those working, men were more likely to be employed full time. For example, 2 years after graduation, 84 percent of women and 86 percent of men were employed; however, 92 percent of employed men were working full time, compared with 87 percent of employed women. Age, major, and grade-point average In addition to gender, several other characteristics of bachelor's degree recipients were related to their patterns of marriage, parenthood, graduate enrollment and attainment, and employment. These characteristics include age at graduation, undergraduate field of study, and undergraduate GPA.   . First, older graduates were more likely to have married before earning their bachelor's degree. Among women who had not married by the time they graduated, women under 30 were more likely than women who were older to marry within the next 4 years. For both men and women, those ages 25-29 at graduation were more likely than those in other age groups to become parents within 4 years of graduation. Age was a factor for graduate enrollment as well, with both men and women who were age 22 or younger when they earned their bachelor's degree more likely than older graduates to enter graduate school within 4 years after graduation. Second, graduates who majored in professional fields2 as a group were more likely to be married and to have children before graduating, compared with graduates who majored in the arts and sciences. Those majoring in the arts and sciences were more likely than those in professional fields to enroll in a graduate program. Probably due to their higher levels of graduate enrollment, bachelor's degree recipients who majored in the arts and sciences were less likely to be employed during the first 4 years following graduation. Finally, graduates with higher GPAs were more likely to be married and have children before graduating. Those with higher GPAs were also more likely to enroll in a graduate program, enroll in a first-professional or doctoral program, and attain a graduate degree within 4 years of bachelor's degree receipt."}, {"section_title": "Interrelationships Among Transitions", "text": "In general, marriage, parenthood, graduate enrollment and attainment, and employment appeared to have different interrelationships for women and men."}, {"section_title": "Marriage", "text": "Graduate enrollment and marriage were negatively related for women, but not for men.

Similarly, women who married before graduation were less likely to attain a graduate degree, and, among those who attained, less likely to attain a first-professional or doctoral degree. Similar consistent negative links to graduate enrollment and attainment were observed among women who became parents after graduation. Among men, marriage before earning a bachelor's degree was related to a lower rate of enrollment in graduate school, but marriage within the next 4 years was not related to the rate of enrollment.

Among college attendees with similar levels of prior educational achievement, Blacks' college completion rates were as high as, or higher than, the college completion rates of Whites. Throughout elementary and secondary school, Blacks scored lower, overall, on mathematics and reading tests than Whites. Even for children with similar test scores one or two grades earlier, Blacks generally scored lower in mathematics and reading than Whites. The Black-White mathematics gap differed in size across grades, in a manner consistent with, but not necessarily demonstrating, a narrowing of the gap during elementary school, followed by a widening of the gap during junior high school and little change during senior high school. The Black-White reading gap also differed in size across grades, but not in an entirely consistent manner; it grew wider between grades within two elementary school cohorts, but was narrower for cohorts observed in grades 9 and 12 than for a cohort observed in grade 2. In general, the findings show that, for children and young adults with similar levels of prior educational achievement, the educational and economic performance of Blacks relative to Whites was substantially greater than the performance of Blacks relative to Whites as a whole. While Blacks have lower levels of educational achievement, educational attainment, and earnings than Whites, these disparities are frequently smaller, and are sometimes entirely absent, for individuals with similar levels of prior educational achievement. Factors other than differences in prior educational achievement may contribute to Black-White gaps in achievement, employment, and earnings; nonetheless, Blacks' relative educational achievement during elementary and secondary school appeared to be highly correlated with their relative success in the academy and the economy. Note: This study does not attempt to isolate the causal relationship between educational achievement and subsequent educational and economic outcomes. Rather, using educational achievement as an indicator for the cognitive backgrounds of children and young adults, it investigates the extent to which Black-White disparities are present for individuals with similar levels of prior educational achievement. The comparison of outcomes for Blacks and Whites with similar levels of educational achievement does not indicate what outcomes for all Blacks would be if their average achievement were raised to the level for Whites.

This study uses the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) 1990 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:90/94), a nationally representative sample of all students who enrolled in postsecondary education for the first time between July 1,1989, and June 30,1990. Follow-up interviews were conducted in spring 1992 and 1994. BPS is particularly appropriate for the study of community college students because it is representative of all beginning postsecondary students, not just recent high school graduates. The approach of this report is similar to that used in analyses of individual community colleges or districts, particularly that of Spicer and Armstrong (1996). Holding the numerator constant, variously restrictive definitions of the denominator are employed based on the different approaches to specifying the transfer population found in the literature. This report defines transfer as follows: initial enrollment at a community college followed by subsequent enrollment at any 4-year institution within the 5-year study period. Potential transfer refers to being eligible for transfer or \"at risk\" of transfer. The broadest definition of potential transfer used in this analysis includes all first-time, beginning community college students, although students only taking courses for which they receive no credit are excluded from the BPS sample. The pool of potential transfer students is then restricted using eight additional definitions of the 120 1 denominator. They are referred to as \"increasingly restrictive\" because the total proportion of the sample that is included generally decreases, although the more restrictive groups are not necessarily subsets of the less restrictive groups. These definitions were selected to approximate measures commonly used in previous research, from explicit student goals to behaviors often thought to indicate intent to transfer or commitment to postsecondary education. They are as follows: 1) Expected to complete bachelor's degree or higher; 2) Enrolled in an academic program; 3) Enrolled continuously in 1989-90; 4) Enrolled anytime in academic year 1990-91; 5) Pursuing academic major or taking courses toward a bachelor's degree or both; 6) Enrolled for 12 or more credit hours; 7) Taking courses toward a bachelor's degree in 1989-90; and 8) Pursuing academic major and taking courses toward a bachelor's degree. The analysis begins with estimating the percentage of the 1989-90 cohort of beginning community college students who meet each of these definitions. The relationship of these criteria to various other student characteristics is then explored. The first issue to be examined is whether the composition of the pool of potential transfer students varies as the definitions become more restrictive. Then, consideration is given to whether different subgroups of students are more or less likely to meet each definition. Finally, a transfer rate is calculated for each definition of potential transfer students, and the relationships of these definitions to transfer are explored."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Overall, 71 percent of 1989-90 beginning community college students responded that they anticipated earning a bachelor's degree or higher when asked, \"What is the highest level of education you ever expect to complete?\" (figure A).

This contextual information is not intended to constitute a statistical comparison across studies. In general, however, BPS estimates of the percentage of beginning community college students whose expectations included a bachelor's degree or higher, as well as the percentage of students who transferred to a 4-year institution, are higher than estimates based on other data sets. Dougherty (1987Dougherty ( , 1992, for example, reviewed several studies and concluded that 30 to 40 percent of all community college entrants aspire to a bachelor's degree, while the present study found that 71 percent of community college students in BPS expect to complete a bachelor's degree or higher. Similarly, while the overall transfer rate found in this study is comparable to the average estimate of 22 percent found by the Transfer Assembly project (Cohen and Sanchez 1997), both the numerator and denominator of the Transfer Assembly project are more restrictive. Although BPS data do not facilitate use of such a restrictive definition, an approximation of it using BPS data yielded a transfer rate of 33 percent, somewhat higher than the rate resulting from the Transfer Assembly project. However, any comparisons between the estimates presented in this report and those from other studies must be considered in light of differences in how the overall population of community college students is defined across studies. For example, BPS excluded students taking courses only for remedial or avocational purposes without receiving credit, while other estimates may include these students. As a result, the typical amount of remediation for students in BPS may underestimate, or otherwise differ from, the amount of remediation found among community college students in generala factor that might be associated with transfer to a 4-year institution. Furthermore, this report focuses only on students enrolled in public 2-year colleges; including other less-than-4-year colleges, particularly lessthan-2-year institutions, may lower the estimates. In addition, BPS data are restricted to first-time beginning postsecondary students; colleges conducting their own studies of transfer may include entering students who are not first-time beginners as defined in the BPS study. Finally, it could also be that student aspirations change appreciably from one cohort to the next and that estimates therefore could depend in part on when the survey was administered. 124"}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "This study used the IPEDS database.
