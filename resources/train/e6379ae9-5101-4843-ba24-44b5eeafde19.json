[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Introduction: This study's aims are to identify whether a relationship between statin use and rate of cognitive decline exists. The relationship between statins and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been investigated in the past with the evidence showing mixed results. Methods: Seven hundred sixty-eight subjects were identified with MCI. Subjects were stratified into six possible groups according to apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 allele status and statin use and assessed for decline in cognitive function.\nResults: All cognitive assessments trended toward less decline with statin use. Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale 11 (ADAS 11) showed the biggest difference in mean change between statin users and nonusers (20.82 vs. 21.22, respectively). Change reached marginal significance on the ADAS 11 when stratified by APOE \u03b54-negative subjects. Discussion: All cognitive assessments trended toward less decline when subjects were concurrently treated with a statin, supporting the position that statins do not have a net negative effect on cognitive assessment and suggesting a potential treatment benefit."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasingly prevalent in the United States. As of 2015, there are an estimated 5.3 million individuals in the United States suffering from AD. It also affects approximately 10% of the population over the age of 65 years [1] . The rate of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) progressing to dementia when thought to be of neurodegenerative origin is approximately 10% per year. The rate of decline on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in AD is approximated at 3 to 3.5 points per year. In rapidly progressive cases, decline can reach 5-6 points annually [2] . Mean survival after diagnosis of AD ranges from 3-8 years [2] .\nThe direct effects of plasma cholesterol and related lipoproteins on the incidence of dementia and cognitive decline have long been controversial. Senile neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the pathogenic hallmarks of AD, and increasing evidence links brain cholesterol with both plaques and tangles [3] . Recent studies have shown a positive correlation between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels and MMSE performance and a negative correlation between low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and immediate and delayed recall [4] . Several epidemiological studies also showed that elevated total serum cholesterol was a significant risk factor for AD, independent of apolipoprotein E (APOE) allele status [2] . Lowering cholesterol levels via statins is associated with decreased b-amyloid [5] .\nPast studies noted that subjects with incident dementia had higher total cholesterol at their first visit [6] . Cholesterol levels and atherosclerosis have also been found to correlate with AD [7] . Increased glucose levels and decreased HDL levels increase risk of incident MCI [6] . High midlife total cholesterol has been associated with decreased memory and fluency later in life [8] . For this reason, statins have long been purported to play a role in cognitive decline; however, the general consensus on this role is mixed. Recent studies have shown that statin use is associated with a reduced risk of dementia. Specifically, lipophilic statins were found to have the greatest reduction in risk [9] .\nEvidence that statins decrease the risk of incident dementia is convincing from an epidemiological standpoint. Some studies show that statin users had a 5-fold lower risk of incident AD and a 3-fold lower risk of MCI [6] . Statins have also been shown to decrease the risk of AD in subjects younger than 80 years old, after controlling for sex, education level, and self-rated health [10] . There have been three major clinical trials investigating the role of statins in cognitive decline. The Collaborative Lowdose Aspirin Study in Pregnancy (CLASP) study in 2011 assessed the use of simvastatin in probable AD. It showed no significant difference in cognitive decline between statin therapy and a placebo when measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADASCog) [11] . The Lipitor's Effect in Alzheimer's Dementia (LEADe) trial in 2010 studied atorvastatin therapy in mild-to-moderate AD and showed no net benefit of statin therapy to placebo over 72 weeks [12] . This study focused on ADAS-Cog and ADAS-Clinical Global Impression of Change as benchmarks. These two clinical trials contradict the initial findings by Sparks in 2005 that displayed a significantly decreased rate of cognitive decline by atorvastatin on ADAS-Cog and MMSE scores over 6 months [13] . These values were also near significant at the 12-month mark [13] . All three of these trials focused on subjects with AD. The Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER) trial also showed that pravastatin had no significant effect on cognitive function in the elderly [14] . Clinical trial data on subjects with MCI do not exist. The severity of disease progression among the selected subject population may play a role. By focusing on individuals categorized as MCI, any relationship between progression of cognitive impairment and statin use should be teased out more easily.\nThe ADNI database has the unique attribute of possessing prospectively collected data, which have not been analyzed in past studies. Past epidemiological studies have focused on utilizing retrospectively gathered data. The focus of this study will be to assess whether or not cognitive decline is affected by a statin regimen. Randomized controlled trials suggest that the dementia stage of AD may be too late for significant benefits of statin therapy [15] . To assess cognitive decline at an earlier time point in disease progression, it is necessary to study subjects that have not progressed to AD. MCI is an ideal population to assess whether or not early intervention with a statin will be beneficial."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by principal investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD.\nADNI's data requisition website was the source of all data. The analysis focused on information contained within a summary file that ADNI had compiled and a medication file containing home medications for each subject. These files were the ADNIMERGE and RECCMEDS data files, respectively. This list was used to isolate any subject that had been prescribed a statin. Each subject was included in the database regardless of statin type or dose. No other lipid-lowering medications were considered when data were being collected; however, patients concurrently on other lipid-lowering agents were not excluded from analysis. Of the 1737 subjects contained within the ADNIMERGE file, 939 were identified as statin users after crossreferencing with the RECCMEDS file. Statins queried include atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin.\nADNI's summary file was then used to isolate any subject within the database who was labeled as having a diagnosis of MCI. ADNI has classified each subject into various levels of cognition based on the Petersen criteria for MCI [16] . The two levels of progression that we decided to include in our definition of MCI were the early and late MCI. Within these categories, 872 subjects were identified with a diagnosis of MCI. These two parameters (statin status and MCI status) formed the major categorical parameters for isolating data. MCI status formed our inclusion criteria, and statin status formed the dividing line between control and test groups.\nAll enrolled subjects or their legal representatives sign a written informed consent approved by an Institutional Review Board (Western Institutional Review Board, Puyallup, WA). Annual visits and examinations for cognition and criteria for clinical diagnoses are as previously described. All assessments were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\nAll subjects who had two cognitive assessments at least 1 year apart were then identified. This would make a valuation of cognitive change over a 1-year period possible and assess whether or not statins played a role in rate of change. Among the 872 subjects with a past diagnosis of MCI, 768 subjects also had greater than 1 year of cognitive assessment.\nFinally, to formulate the parameters for each test group, we evaluated subjects' APOE \u03b54 allele status. Within the ADNI database, each subject was labeled as a 0, 1, or 2 depending on how many APOE \u03b54 alleles he or she carried. A status of 0 correlates to homozygous negative for APOE \u03b54(2/2), 1 correlates to heterozygous for APOE \u03b54(1/2), and 2 correlates to homozygous positive for APOE \u03b54(1/1).\nThis final parameter was cross-referenced with each subject's statin status to yield six total groups:\n1. MCI, APOE \u03b54(2/2), statin negative (n 5 179), 2. MCI, APOE \u03b54(2/2), statin positive (n 5 198), 3. MCI, APOE \u03b54(1/1), statin negative (n 5 26), 4. MCI, APOE \u03b54(1/1), statin positive (n 5 60), 5. MCI, APOE \u03b54(1/2), statin negative (n 5 120), and 6. MCI, APOE \u03b54(1/2), statin positive (n 5 185).\nThese six groups were then analyzed in three separate iterations. First, the data were analyzed as two large groups: MCI statin positive and MCI statin negative. These groups had 443 and 325 subjects, respectively. The analysis of these two groups would yield information on the effect statins have on MCI independent of APOE \u03b54 status. We then performed a second analysis comparing MCI, APOE \u03b54 (1/1), statin positive versus MCI, APOE \u03b54 (1/1), statin negative (245 and 146 subjects, respectively), and a second group comparing MCI APOE \u03b54 (2/2) statin positive versus MCI, APOE \u03b54 (2/2), statin negative (198 and 179 subjects, respectively). In this iteration, APOE \u03b54 (1/2) and APOE \u03b54 (1/1) were lumped together in the APOE \u03b54 (1/1) category. The final analysis compared the six groups shown previously. ApoE4 trait, carriers, and negatives were used as controls comparing the effects statins had on each group. Each subject was analyzed by multiple forms of cognitive assessment yielding up to four possible cognitive assessments: The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale 11 (ADAS 11), ADAS 13 (ADAS 13), MMSE, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Each subject is given baseline scores for each cognitive assessment at the time of being entered into the ADNI database. These scores were compared with future cognitive assessment as close as possible to 1 year in the future. This cognitive change was the value used to assess significance.\nThe data were then reassessed in a mixed-effects model while controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, and marital status. This analysis consisted of the same six iterations as stated previously; however, it used all data points based on how many years past baseline they occurred."}, {"section_title": "Statistical methods", "text": "Demographic characteristics of statin users and nonusers were evaluated using descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, frequencies, and proportions. Two-sample t-tests were implemented to determine differences in means between statin users and nonusers. Furthermore, chi-squared analysis was employed to test differences in proportions. Means and standard deviations of outcome differences from baseline were assessed in statin users and nonusers. Two-sample t-tests were used to determine differences in outcome change from baseline. To investigate whether the APOE \u03b54 status confounded the results, we assessed means and standard deviations of outcome differences from baseline between statin users and nonusers in strata defined by APOE \u03b54 status (APOE \u03b54 negative or APOE \u03b54 positive). Further analyses were performed within the APOE \u03b54-positive stratum by further stratifying by ApoE4 trait status (APOE \u03b54 [1/2] or APOE \u03b54[1/1]). Finally, the generalized mixed-effects model was implemented to estimate the mean differences of the primary outcomes between the six APOE \u03b54/statin groups with \"MCI, APOE \u03b54(2/2), statin negative\" as our reference group. The final model adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, marital status, and time from baseline. Furthermore, the interaction group, APOE \u03b54/statin group ! time, was added to the model to ascertain whether the time from baseline modifies the association between APOE \u03b54/statin status and the primary outcomes.

First, all cognitive assessments trended toward less decline when the subject was concurrently treated with a statin. This supports the position that statins do not have a net negative effect on any form of cognitive assessment. When APOE \u03b54 allele status was examined as a covariate by holding statin status constant, statistical significance was found in two of four cognitive assessments in statin-negative subjects and in three of four cognitive assessments in statin-positive subjects. ADAS 13 and MMSE in statin-negative subjects and ADAS 11, ADAS 13, and MMSE in statin-positive patients were found to have APOE \u03b54 positivity. These data suggest the effect of statins is not primarily an APOE \u03b54 effect. Finally, although no significant numerical trends were apparent, the trending of the data does suggest a potential treatment benefit. When it comes to the mixed-effects model, all iterations that were statin positive had less cognitive decline compared with their statin-negative counterparts. This trend held firm across all four cognitive assessments.\nPast studies have shown that APOE \u03b54 carriers have significantly greater mean LDL compared with APOE \u03b54-negative individuals [17] . However, no significant differences were noted in total cholesterol, HDL, total cholesterol to HDL ratio, or triglyceride levels [17] . APOE \u03b54 heterozygotes were also noted to have higher HDL levels and lower total cholesterol to HDL ratios compared with APOE \u03b54 homozygotes. Because of the significant effect that statins have on LDL, it would seem appropriate for APOE \u03b54 carriers to have a greater reduction in rate of cognitive decline than their APOE \u03b54-negative counterparts. Consistent with these past studies, APOE \u03b54(1/1) subjects had higher rates of cognitive decline.\nAside from the obvious effects statins have on cholesterol and lipoprotein levels, statins have been found to have other effects that may prove effective against dementia progression. Statins have anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic effects that block the synthesis of isopretinoid intermediates, which serve as lipid attachments for intercellular signaling [2] . Not all effects of statins have proved beneficial. Statins have been shown to decrease levels of vitamin E and ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10). Research speculates that decreased levels of lipoproteins in the blood lead to subtle impairments in mental processing via vitamin E, vitamin A, and other fat-soluble substances [2] . Confounding this issue is the fact that cognitive impairments and decrements over time are associated with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, etc. Cerebrovascular changes (white matter hyperintensities) increase stroke risk, and these individuals are very likely to receive statin therapy [18] . For these reasons, the general consensus on statins is that the current evidence is insufficient.\nThe limitation with the largest potential impact on this study is the possibility of confounders. APOE \u03b54 has already been identified as a potential confounder. MCI can arise from different etiologies, and the effect of statins on these various causes cannot be extrapolated from our data. Other potential confounders could arise from the patient population. Drug interaction and other comorbidities associated with people on a statin regimen may also confound our data. Our sampling did not consist of subjects whose sole medication was a statin. Our analysis also lacks information regarding dose and duration of statin use. The ability to separate groups into high-dose and low-dose users was not possible. Our analysis consisted of cognitive assessment over a time period greater than 1 year. Although each subject's time points were narrowed to as close to one year as possible, potential outliers may have arisen from subjects whose cognitive assessments were prolonged over an extended timeframe. Finally, one potentially beneficial analysis not performed is a multivariate analysis controlling for age, diabetes, cholesterol levels, heart disease, or other health conditions.\nFuture research needs to reconcile the disparate points of view. Because we show here that statins have no adverse effect on cognition in MCI and may have a slight positive benefit, a clinical trial should be considered with sample sizes large enough to detect significant differences with statin treatment. 3. Future directions: Statin use might continue to be beneficial. This approach from ADNI needs to be recapitulated in AD dementia. Other studies need to view whether subjects with AD dementia have a lower pathological burden for AD pathology. Finally, this might make an argument for a primary prevention trial with statins."}]
