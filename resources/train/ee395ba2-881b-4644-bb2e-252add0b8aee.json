The uncertainties associated with such changes and the e\u00a4ect of management responses pose challenges for economic analysis and decisionmaking (Ando and Mallory 2012; Heal and Millner 2014; LaRiviere et al. 2018; Newbold and Marten 2014; Pindyck 2007) . Migrating coastal systems such as salt marshes exemplify the type of dynamics for which climate-related uncertainty is relevant for management. Salt marshes are regularly \u2021ooded intertidal habitats that provide multiple ecological functions (Vernberg 1993) . The value of these systems is well established and has been recognized as an important motivation for coastal management (Barbier et al. 2011 (Barbier et al. , 2013 Gopalakrishnan et al. 2018; Interis and Petrolia 2016; Johnston et al. 2002a Johnston et al. ,b, 2005 Milon and Scrogin 2006; Petrolia et al. 2014) . Until recently salt marshes have been largely resilient to changes in sea level due to natural adjustments in elevation via vegetation growth and sediment accretion, and by migrating landward as sea levels rise (Kirwan et al. 2010 (Kirwan et al. , 2016a . However, there is now widespread concern about the loss of marsh bene\u2026ts given the accelerated and uncertain rise in sea level, with regional and global analyses forecasting a 20 45% marsh loss by 2100 (Craft et al. 2009; McFadden et al. 2007 ).\nE\u00a4orts to sustain salt marshes typically emphasize the preservation of transgression zones -undeveloped uplands onto which marshes can migrate landward as sea levels rise. Given limits in the extent to which marshes can build elevation naturally, the preservation of these zones-often via fee-simple purchase by conservation organizations-is necessary to ensure marsh persistence in many areas (Enwright et al. 2016; Field et al. 2017; Kirwan and Megonigal 2013; Kirwan et al. 2016b; Torio and Chmura 2013) . The extent to which preserved transgression zones eventually become marsh, however, depends on uncertain future sea level rise (SLR) and natural dynamics that determine when and where marshes migrate (Enwright et al. 2016; Feagin et al. mitigation depend on carbon-price paths. 1 Yet while the capacity to reduce risk via hedging can have \u2026rst-order implications for management (LaRiviere et al. 2018) , economic analyses of conservation decisions rarely capitalize on the insights available from portfolio theory. Moreover, we are aware of no economic model able to inform management diversi\u2026cation of this type for dynamic, migrating coastal systems such as salt marshes. 2 This paper develops the \u2026rst portfolio model designed to optimize the bene\u2026ts of a migrating coastal system. The model focuses on the diversi\u2026cation of transgression zone investments to maximize marsh conservation bene\u2026ts, while hedging risk across transgression zone types. The model also provides insight into how diversi\u2026cation can be adapted to address factors such as di\u00a4ering SLR expectations and preservation additionality, among other features. Unlike most diversi\u2026cation models in the environmental literature that derive empirical solutions using modern portfolio theory (Markowitz 1952; e.g., Ando and Mallory 2012; Mallory and Ando 2014; Sanchirico et al. 2008 ), here we develop a dynamic model following Merton (1969 Merton ( , 1971 ) that provides closed-form analytical solutions (Bretschger and Vinogradova 2017; Martin 2016, Leroux et al. 2018) . 3 An empirical illustration is provided using an application to the Virginia Coast Reserve Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, USA, focusing on portfolios that preserve agri-1 Portfolio analyses in ecology and engineering address such topics as species biodiversity and \u2021ood management (Aerts et al. 2008; Crowe and Parker 2008; Figge 2004; Koellner and Schmitz 2006; Moore et al. 2010; Schindler et al. 2010; Yemshanov et al. 2014; Zhou et al. 2012) . Additional work in economics considers diversi\u2026cation in environmental and resource management, but does not develop optimal portfolios (e.g., Gourguet et al. 2014; Jardine and Sanchirico 2015; Kasperski and Holland 2013; Sethi et al. 2014) . 2 Even analyses proposed as a means to inform salt marsh conservation under uncertainty fail to consider the role of diversi\u2026cation (e.g., Propato et al. 2018) . 3 Bretschger and Vinogradova (2017) derive analytical solutions for the optimal consumption pro\u2026le and aggregate income share allocated to national emission abatement with uncertain bene\u2026ts. In the context of water, closed-form solutions for the optimal water consumption path and composition of an urban water supply are derived by Leroux and Martin (2016) and augmented in Leroux et al. (2018) to allow for stochastic habit formation in water consumption. Our theoretical speci\u2026cation is adapted to represent dynamic coastal resource, and unlike previous dynamic portfolio models allows for the portfolio to be comprised of only risky assets. cultural land, forest land and intertidal land with established marsh. Our empirical results point to the bene\u2026ts of emphasizing a particular land type for marsh transgression (higher-elevation agricultural land) that currently represents only a small portion of coastal conservation portfolios. The underlying biophysical model accounts for the dynamic nature of salt marsh geomorphology via a spatial, dynamic, process-based approach. Although we develop the model for marshes, it may be adapted to other systems whose sustainability depends on migration, including beaches, dunes and mangroves (Barbier et al. 2011; Gopalakrishnan et al. 2018; Millar et al. 2007; Parsons et al. 2013 )."}, {"section_title": "A Portfolio Model for Salt Marsh Migration", "text": "The goal of portfolio design is to identify the combination of land types for preservation that exploits risk hedging opportunities to maximize expected marsh bene\u2026ts, subject to decision-makers'risk aversion and budget. A number of \u2026nancial portfolio models, including Markowitz (1952) and Merton (1971) , could provide a basic foundation for a model of this type. Common to all of these is the premise that in an uncertain world the optimal portfolio e\u00a2 ciently trades o\u00a4 expected portfolio returns against the variance of those returns. Markowitz'framework enables the identi\u2026cation of an e\u00a2 cient portfolio frontier within a static variance-return space, while Merton's model yields the e\u00a2 cient portfolio that maximizes the \u2021ow of bene\u2026ts over time for a given set of risk preferences. The former is predominantly empirical; results are typically obtained via numerical methods given an assumed model structure. The present model is based on the latter approach, which generates closed-form analytical solutions from which general economic intuition can be derived, as well as empirical results from a case study.\nLike all models of this type in \u2026nance or elsewhere, some aspects of the problem are simpli\u2026ed to promote tractability and to enable a focus on issues that are most relevant to the decision context. The model is also designed around parameters for which empirical estimates are commonly available. The goal is a readily applicable model that provides practical insights for marsh conservation. At the same time, we acknowledge key assumptions and identify mechanisms through which they might be relaxed as part of model extensions."}, {"section_title": "Salt Marsh Dynamics Under Sea-Level Rise", "text": "Development of the model requires an understanding of biophysical marsh dynamics.\nThe dynamics of salt marsh evolution depend on interactions among hydrology, plant growth, and sediment transport (Fagherazzi et al. 2012; Kirwan and Megonigal 2013; Reed 1995) . The change in marsh area over time depends on the ability of marshes to build elevation vertically (or accrete) at rates greater than relative SLR, and/or to migrate onto upland areas at rates faster than erosion at their seaward edge (Kirwan et al. 2016b ). The ability of marshes to build elevation naturally is limited by factors such as sediment supply and vegetation growth, and hence vertical accretion can only sustain marshes up to a certain threshold rate of SLR (Kirwan et al. 2010) . 4 When the vertical elevation of marsh at any given point cannot keep up with SLR, it eventually \"drowns\"and becomes open water.\nWhen this occurs, the only way that marsh can be sustained is if it migrates onto adjacent uplands (Feagin et al. 2010; Kirwan et al. 2016b; Kirwan and Megonigal 2013; Torio and Chmura 2013) . That is, as seas rise, upland areas adjacent to marshes obtain the ecological conditions (e.g., degree and frequency of inundation, soil salinity) that enable them to become marsh (Anisfeld et al. 2017; Brinson et al. 1995; Raabe and Stumpf 2015; Schieder et al. 2018) . The ability of marshes to \"migrate\"in this way depends on an array of biophysical factors, and on the absence of coastal development or armoring. If adjacent upland areas are armored (e.g., using sea walls), developed, or topographically altered (via arti\u2026cial sediment deposition), marshes can no longer migrate and will be progressively drowned as they are \"squeezed\" between hardened uplands and rising seas (Enwright et al. 2016; Torio and Chmura 2013) . Hence, preservation of undeveloped and unarmored uplands for marsh migration, typically called preserved marsh transgression zones, is necessary for marsh sustainability, and particularly in areas with rapid coastal development (Kirwan et al. 2016b; Kirwan and Megonigal 2013) .\nThe speed of SLR and coastal development has motivated calls for \"urgent attention\"and \"pre-emptive planning to set aside key coastal areas for wetland migration\" (Runting et al. 2017, p. 49) . This urgency, also seen in marsh conservation strategies (e.g., The Nature Conservancy in Virginia 2011), informs the economic model that is developed. If marsh conservation actions were seen as less urgent, other model types might be more salient. For example, in some cases the question of optimal preservation might be viewed as a real options problem (Arrow and Fisher 1974) wherein the optimal timing and allocation of land purchases for marsh preservation depend on the speed with which new SLR information becomes available. Models of this general type have been developed to inform conservation under climate change (Leroux and Whitten 2014) . However, two properties of the marsh conservation context imply that an optimal portfolio approach is better suited to provide relevant information. First, coastal development pressures in many areas are such that conservation agencies do not have the luxury to \"wait and see\" for SLR uncertainty to resolve before making decisions. Second, conservation decisions are not irreversible as portfolios can be rebalanced at any time to account for updated information as it becomes available. Re- \u2021ecting this situation, marsh conservation decisions are typically viewed in terms that are consistent with an optimal portfolio perspective (i.e., how to allocate conservation investments now, based on available information). Hence, we proceed with a portfolio model, while acknowledging that other adaptation contexts may be conducive to real options or other approaches that account for decision time paths."}, {"section_title": "De\u2026ning Portfolio Assets", "text": "To examine natural resource conservation from a portfolio perspective requires that all relevant management options are identi\u2026ed and grouped into classes pertinent for the decision context. These options de\u2026ne the assets over which the portfolio is optimized.\nAmong the choices to be made are (1) how many assets to include, and (2) whether assets are de\u2026ned in explicit spatial terms. Closed-form models of this type generally include a small number of assets to maintain tractability. Assets are further chosen to match the primary conservation choices under consideration (e.g., Ando and Mallory 2012; Leroux and Martin 2016) . In the case of salt marsh conservation these choices include di\u00a4erent types of land preservation that provide areas on which marsh may exist now or in the future. These land types are de\u2026ned as mutually exclusive combinations of land cover or use, elevation, location, and other land characteristics that determine marsh dynamics. Preserving a particular land type yields speci\u2026c marsh bene\u2026ts subject to uncertainty. In this sense, land types may be viewed as equivalent to \u2026nancial assets in an investment portfolio, where each asset is characterized by a mean return and standard deviation.\nHere, asset classes are de\u2026ned based on marsh dynamics and the primary land categorizations used within conservation decision-making. Biophysical models of salt marsh evolution-including the one used for our illustration below-are spatial and designed to reproduce the natural migration of marshes (Fargherazzi et al. 2012 ). Models of this type spatially implement equations that characterize marsh migration processes over a gridded topography representing conditions at each study site (Appendix B).\nFor example, marsh accretion rates depend on local elevation relative to mean sea level and on the distance to the closest channel, both of which are spatially variable and change with time. The spatial nature of these forecasts is implied by the patchy nature of marsh changes forecast over time (e.g., see case study below, Figure 2 ). General patterns emerge from these spatial models that can provide insights into the characteristics of the portfolio assets. Low-elevation uplands (largely forest in our case study area)-if preserved-can enable e\u00a4ective marsh migration at low rates of SLR. At higher SLR these low-elevation areas transition from marsh to open water (i.e., drown). Hence, when higher SLR is expected, higher-elevation transgression zones (largely agricultural land in our case study) are better able to support marsh migration and retain marsh properties. The varying slopes of higher versus lower elevation uplands also determine how much land is inundated by any given SLR. For example, lower and \u2021atter areas tend to yield relatively more marsh on average as seas rise, ceteris paribus, but the variance of marsh migration due to changes in sea level is also greater-leading to a mean versus variance trade-o\u00a4. In addition to preserving uplands for marsh migration, one can preserve intertidal land on which marsh is already established. This preserves current marsh independent of upland migration, and is an e\u00a4ective way to retain marsh at very low SLR, where there is minimal risk of marsh drowning.\nThese patterns are used to de\u2026ne assets within the model. Most marsh conservation sites include intertidal land and adjacent uplands. In our case study, upland areas are characterized by high correlation in elevation and land use: agricultural land is found at higher elevations and at a greater distance from the Atlantic Ocean than lowerelevation forested land. Conservation decision-making emphasizes these three land types (agricultural land, forest and intertidal salt marsh) in areas suitable for marsh migration (The Nature Conservancy 2011; The Nature Conservancy in Virginia 2011; Bruce and Crichton 2014) . Re \u2021ecting this situation, the model is designed around these three preservation land types.\nAlthough we illustrate the model using this land classi\u2026cation, the model structure is general and can accommodate any classi\u2026cation for which marsh migration can be modeled. It is conceptually straightforward to extend the model to more than three land types or to other classi\u2026cations. 5 For example, if explicitly spatial categorizations are desired, the model can be adapted accordingly. In general, however, practical limits on asset numbers and data availability constrain the use of portfolio models for highresolution spatial planning. As noted by Mallory and Ando (2014, p. 4) , these models are \"most useful for coarse-scale conservation targeting exercises and less well-suited to function as a parcel-level targeting tool.\" However, portfolios emerging from these models can be combined with supplementary analyses that support spatial targeting within each portfolio class; an example is provided in Section 4.4 below."}, {"section_title": "Model Structure and Objective Function", "text": "To develop the portfolio model based on these asset classes, let N i be the total area of conserved land of type i in the portfolio, of which proportion S i is currently marsh.

The inter-temporal utility function is maximized with respect to x (t) and asset shares i according to\nWe assume a standard expected utility speci\u2026cation, where utility, U (x), is strictly concave in x (t) and is given by U (x) = x (t) (1 ) = (1 ) : The parameter is a constant relative risk aversion parameter that characterizes the conservation planner's risk attitude associated with the \u2021ow of marsh bene\u2026ts. Given this speci\u2026cation, the conservation planner has logarithmic preferences for = 1 and is risk averse when > 0. The parameter denotes the discount rate. 6 To the extent that marsh intrusion is correlated with saltwater intrusion, this may also capture e\u00a4ects related to the latter. Although the biophysical e\u00a4ects of saltwater intrusion on agricultural land have been studied (Tully et al. 2019) , we are aware of no research that models the e\u00a4ect of saltwater intrusion (or anticipated SLR itself) on the cost of di\u00a4erent types of land preservation. Hence, we leave related extensions of the model for future work. 7 This terminology does not imply a traditional budget constraint of the type encountered in static utility maximization; the formal dynamic constraints for this model are derived below."}, {"section_title": "Dynamic Constraints", "text": "Equation (3) is maximized subject to two dynamic constraints.

Here we use the biophysical model's aggregated dynamics by land class, describing the change in marsh proportion on land class i as a Brownian motion. The mean proportional change of marsh on land type i is denoted i and the uncertainty associated with marsh dynamics on this land type is described by the variance 2 i : The Brownian motion z i is normally distributed with mean zero and variance dt; z i N (0; dt). We allow for marsh risk to be correlated across the di\u00a4erent land types, dz a dz f = af dt; dz a dz m = am dt and dz f dz m = f m dt: We expect migration onto agricultural and forest land to be positively correlated, 0 < af < 1; as both are driven by SLR.

This assumption implies that private landowners will take actions to prevent unpreserved land from becoming marsh (e.g., armoring). Similarly, it is assumed that existing marsh on unpreserved intertidal land will be developed and converted into some other land use. Hence, the only way that managers can ensure the future persistence of marsh is to preserve land. 8"}, {"section_title": "Dynamic Marsh Budget Constraint", "text": "To derive the dynamic constraint on the size of the marsh portfolio, denoted as the dynamic (marsh) budget constraint, we begin with the marsh budget as described above and de\u2026ned by (1).

This is consistent with the wetland valuation literature, none of which identi\u2026es a systematic e\u00a4ect of marsh provenance on value. Hence, average marsh value is initially assumed to be independent of its provenance (i.e., the original land type), and hence optimizing over marsh area is formally equivalent to optimizing over marsh value, if one considers a typical area and type of marsh.

For example, thus far we have assumed that privately owned land will be armored with probability p i = 1 to prevent marsh from migrating onto that land. Similarly, we have assumed that existing marsh will be developed or otherwise lost in the absence of conservation. Under these assumptions, the additional bene\u2026t from purchasing a unit of land for marsh transgression is equal to the expected marsh bene\u2026t on that land. In practice, however, not all private land will likely be armored against SLR, nor will all unpreserved salt marsh be developed. Where private land remains unarmored, marsh can migrate onto that land in the same way as it migrates onto preserved land. Consequently, the economic bene\u2026t of spending conservation funds to preserve private land that will never be armored or developed in the future is zero, because preserving this type of land provides no additional bene\u2026t. These issues relate to the concept of additionality, or whether the environmental services provided by a given policy intervention would have been provided in the absence of that intervention (Pattanayak et al. 2010) .\nTo allow for additionality, we extend the model to consider the probabilities p a , p f and p m of armoring private agricultural land and forest or developing intertidal land as being equivalent to the additionality provided by conserving that land. Suppose that conservation of a piece of forest land has a probability of being armored of p f = 0:25:\nThis would imply that marsh transgression in the absence of conservation would occur with probability of 1 p f = 0:75; thereby reducing the value of marsh bene\u2026t from conserving this land by 3=4: The e\u00a4ect of additionality matters for the analysis if the probability p i varies across land types.

This solution parallels that shown previously in equations (14) - (16) and (17), but with c i replaced by c i =v i and i d (c i =v i ) =dS i ; while M is interpreted as the physical marsh budget and expressed in km 2 .\nAn identical model structure may be used to account for cases in which the value of marsh depends on provenance, or the type of land from which the marsh originated.\nFor example, one might consider a case in which marsh that was originally agricultural land has higher or lower average value than marsh that was originally forest. In this case, the equation introduced above, v i p i v, may be reinterpreted as a measure of di\u00a4erent underlying unit values of marsh bene\u2026t from land type i, whereby p i = 1 is assigned to the land type that generates the highest-value marsh, and p i < 1 to other land types, re \u2021ecting the proportionally lower value of marsh from those land types.\nDepending on the interpretation of this model structure (i.e., additionality or provenance e\u00a4ects on marsh bene\u2026ts), the formal solution leads to an intuitive result that higher shares of land type i in the optimal portfolio are associated with (a) higher probability of armoring on land type i (and hence greater additionality), and/or (b) higher value of marsh originating from land type i.

Given development pressures, a major focus of conservation in the area is the preservation of marsh transgression zones (Bruce and Crichton 2014; The Nature Conservancy 2011).\nThis case study site is similar to many other coastal areas in the US and elsewhere.\nHence, while the speci\u2026c empirical results of the analysis are limited to our case study site, the general patterns and economic intuition are likely applicable to other areas.\nThe biophysical model is run over a 90-year time horizon until 2100. The leftmost map shows current land cover, followed by projected mean model results for projected SLRs of 0.32, 0.60, 0.90 and 1.7m, moving rightward. These illustrative forecasts assume that all undeveloped land is preserved for migration, and illustrate a situation in which marsh migration exceeds drowning at low SLR, but drowning exceeds migration at higher SLR. At the highest level of 1:7m, virtually all existing marsh is projected to be lost by 2100. 13 Figure 2 about here 12 Independent calibrations are provided for each SLR projection, based on standard modeling approaches (Kirwan et al. 2016b ). Each projection is grounded in a unique, path-dependent set of \"underlying ... socioeconomic conditions and technological considerations\" (Sweet et al. 2017, p. 13) . Because future conditions cannot instantaneously jump between the socio-technical scenarios underlying di\u00a4erent SLR projections (given their path-dependence), separate migration models are estimated and portfolios identi\u2026ed for each one. We then consider the sensitivity of results to discrete probability distributions over the four SLR projections, allowing for cases in which policy makers have di\u00a4erent perceptions regarding the relative likelihood that each will occur (Section 4.2). This approach parallels the treatment of climate scenarios within prior portfolio models (e.g., Ando and Mallory 2012; Mallory and Ando 2014) . 13 To calculate patterns of potential marsh migration the biophysical model considers the case in which all private land has been purchased as transgression zone land. This does not a\u00a4ect the optimal marsh or land shares calculated from the economic model, which can be applied to a land portfolio of any size."}, {"section_title": "Calibration of the Portfolio Model", "text": "The resulting parameter values used for the baseline model calibration are summarized in Table 1 . The initial proportions of marsh on agricultural S a = 0:03; and on forest land S f = 0:16; were approximated from historic aerial records. 14 The same records suggest that approximately 5% of historic salt marsh has drowned such that S m = 0:95 of what was once marsh remains. Allowing for these initial marsh proportions yields transgression areas of N a = 28:1 km 2 and N f = 25:6 km 2 for agricultural and forest land respectively and an intertidal marsh area of N m = 44:5km 2 . For the baseline model land costs c i per km 2 ; and the marginal changes in these costs for a change in marsh proportion i ; are drawn from Gardner and Johnston (2018) . This prior study reports average purchase costs of di\u00a4erent types of undeveloped land parcels using data on all raw land transactions from 2014 to 2016 in the two counties that encompass the study site (Accomack and Northampton, Virginia). 15 The average costs for each land type are c a = 1; 425; 302 $=km 2 ; c f = 904; 651 $=km 2 and c m = 567; 320 $=km 2 . These are the expected costs of purchasing raw land for preservation via feesimple market purchase, which is the predominant method of land preservation in the area. For the given values of N i ; S i and c i ; the initial marsh budget is calculated as M 0 = 28:82 $m:\nThe marginal change in land costs with respect to marsh intrusion is calculated based on a linear interpolation of these average costs, assuming a 1 percent change of each km 2 of land from one type to another (e.g., farm to marsh). This yields to evaluate the robustness of portfolio results to other land cost assumptions, we also calibrate the model using alternative cost estimates drawn from hedonic models of undeveloped land sales in Gardner and Johnston (2018) and Allen et al. (2006) . These alternative calculations lead to similar land cost estimates and nearly identical optimal portfolio results (Appendix C).\nThe value of marsh, v in equation (8), is not pivotal to the baseline model results as this estimate does not in \u2021uence portfolio shares because bene\u2026ts do not vary by marsh provenance. 16 Hence, we approximate these bene\u2026ts using the published metaanalytic results of Ghermandi et al. (2010) . This meta-analysis allows estimation of wetland value per km 2 per year, for a wetland of speci\u2026ed attributes, generating an estimated value of 3; 104; 403 $=km 2 of marsh. 17 The marsh value reported in Table 1 includes public as well as private bene\u2026ts, where only the private bene\u2026ts can be sold to increase the marsh budget as per equation (8). We assume that these privatizeable bene\u2026ts account for about = 0:05 of total annual marsh bene\u2026ts. We illustrate the model for an annual discount rate of = 0:03, although the model can be readily adapted to any desired rate of discount. 18\nWhile anecdotal evidence points to a high degree of risk aversion among conservationists (e.g., Berrens 2001), there are no empirical studies of the risk attitudes of marsh conservation planners that could be used to determine : Our baseline calibration assumes = 1:5: This value implies a relatively high level of risk aversion in many experimental settings (Holt and Laury 2002) , but falls within the lower range of estimates that are implied by natural resource planners'decisions in related settings (Leroux and Martin 2016; Leroux et al. 2018) . Sensitivity analyses of the results under alternative degrees of risk aversion suggest that the basic results of the model are robust to a wide range of assumptions regarding this parameter. Hence, these results are omitted for conciseness. more volatile, f > a ; than migration onto agricultural land across all scenarios.\nUncertainty with respect to migration increases with higher SLR for migration onto agricultural land, but decreases for migration onto forest. In contrast, the aerial extent of existing marsh remains mostly steady for low and medium SLR and decreases as a result of marsh drowning for higher SLR. The uncertainty surrounding existing marsh also increases with higher SLR. Table 2 show that marsh migration onto agricultural and forest land is positively correlated af > 0. However, across the four scenarios af decreases steadily, which implies that the risks associated with marsh migration are increasingly driven by transgression zone characteristics rather than by uncertainties surrounding marsh migration more generally. Transgression zone migration is negatively correlated with existing salt marsh dynamics, am ; f m < 0, signalling that investment in transgression zone land may be an e\u00a4ective way to hedge against the risk of marsh drowning from rising sea levels. The relative e\u00a4ect of SLR on am and f m ; suggests that agricultural land could be an increasingly important hedge against the risk of existing marsh drowning.

For example, while agricultural marsh shares range from 0:07 a 0:51; for rises in sea level of 0:32m to 0:90m, the corresponding agricultural land shares are considerably higher, between 0:47 l a 0:93: This is because S a < S f < S m : Hence, the land share required to achieve the optimal marsh share from agricultural land is relatively larger than for the other land types. For practical reasons marsh conservation planners are primarily interested in the optimal mix of land in their conservation portfolios, and so the discussion that follows focuses on land shares, l i . 19\nAs shown in Table 3 , optimal land portfolios across all scenarios are dominated by agricultural land. Agricultural land share increases from just below 0:5 to the maximum of 1:0 between the lowest and highest scenarios, as marsh on agricultural land is least likely to drown. The preservation of some current salt marsh area is optimal provided 19 These results are similarly applicable to the optimal marsh portfolio, de\u2026ned by marsh shares i .\nSLR remains low to moderate. Similarly, the bene\u2026ts from investing in forest land for marsh migration are limited to low and medium SLR, as marsh on forest land also becomes highly susceptible to drowning at higher SLR. This illustrates the potentially important role of SLR uncertainty for marsh conservation decisions. "}, {"section_title": "Optimal Portfolios under Combinations of SLR Scenarios", "text": "The optimal conservation portfolio depends on SLR expectations, which could involve some probability distribution over a number of possible scenarios. While decisionmakers'expectations regarding SLR are generally unknown, an optimal portfolio can be generated for any given decision-maker with a speci\u2026ed set of assumptions. 20 Table   4 shows three illustrative cases. The optimistic case assumes that the likelihood of the lowest SLR scenario is 70% with the remaining 30% equally distributed across the other three scenarios. The middle case assumes equal weighting across all four scenarios and the pessimistic case assumes that the highest scenario occurs with a probability of 70% while the three lower scenarios have equal weight of 10%. As shown in columns 2 to 4 in Table 4 , greater optimism by the conservation planner with respect to future SLR implies more diversi\u2026ed portfolios with investments in all three land classes being optimal. As one becomes more pessimistic about SLR, portfolios are re-weighted more heavily towards agricultural land. The portfolio of land that is currently preserved in the study area is reported in the last line of Table 4 , and consists of 14% agricultural land, 7% forest land, and 79% intertidal land. 21 In comparison, all optimal land portfolios for SLRs of 0:32m\nand above place greater emphasis on preserving agricultural land. This result suggests that current conservation strategies may have led to an over-investment in existing salt marsh and under-investment in transgression zone land.\nWhen interpreting the discrepancy between optimal and observed portfolios, it must be recognized that conservation decisions are subject to a number of considerations that are not modeled here, such as supply-and demand-side constraints. For example, not all land types may be available for purchase in required quantities at all times, a conservation agency may not always be in a position to purchase land when it becomes available, and agencies may consider other conservation bene\u2026ts beyond those associated with salt marsh. Planners may have di\u00a4erent expectations regarding SLR than those considered above (although the observed portfolio is non-optimal even under very optimistic SLR expectations). Other considerations that may also in \u2021uence decisions inlcude the relative likelihood of agricultural versus forest land being armored against SLR or existing marsh being developed in the absence of preservation (see Section 4.4). Moreover, despite a sense of urgency concerning the need to preserve transgression zones (Runting et al. 2017) , some conservation planners might nonetheless espouse a \"wait and see\" approach, delaying the preservation of higher-elevation land until sea levels approach these elevations. These and other factors may represent some of the di\u00a4erence between the seemingly non-optimal conservation strategies that are currently observed and the optimal solutions derived here.\nSuch caveats aside, the large discrepancy between the observed and optimal portfolios suggests that current conservation decisions may not be optimal. This is not surprising as there is no means to characterize optimal diversi\u2026cation in the absence of model results such as these. 21 These estimates are based on land conservation data from the NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program, (https://www.coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/)."}, {"section_title": "Bene\u2026ts of Diversi\u2026cation", "text": "To assess the importance of optimal portfolio investment, column 5 of Table 4 reports the ratio of the bene\u2026ts from the optimal x opt ; and observed portfolios x obs , based on (18). 22 Given that the model objective is to identify the portfolio that maximizes marsh bene\u2026ts x in (3), it is not surprising that the optimal portfolio outperforms the observed portfolio in this criterion in all combinations of SLR scenarios considered. The relative bene\u2026ts of portfolio optimization increase the more pessimistic the conservation agency is with respect to SLR. In the optimistic case the bene\u2026ts from the optimal portfolio exceed those obtainable from the observed portfolio by 8%, while the bene\u2026ts from the optimal portfolio are 46% higher than those obtainable from the observed portfolio in the pessimistic case.\nThe observed portfolio includes 79% of intertidal land which is the least expensive land type. Portfolio optimization requires signi\u2026cant investment in comparatively more expensive agricultural land, resulting in 58% to 92% higher land costs than the observed portfolio (column 6, Table 4 ). Implications for net bene\u2026ts (i.e., bene\u2026ts minus costs), are calculated following Hallegatte et al. (2012) . We report the di\u00a4erence in net bene\u2026ts per km 2 of conserved land from the optimal and observed portfolios in the last column of Table 4 . 23 For the optimistic case we observe marginally higher net bene\u2026ts from the optimal portfolio than the observed portfolio. As greater weight is put on to the possibility of high SLR, the optimal portfolio yields net bene\u2026ts that are USD 0:54m higher in the balanced case, and USD 1:55m higher in the pessimistic case than the net bene\u2026ts that result from the observed portfolio. 24 22 The optimal and observed marsh bene\u2026ts are calculated based on the initial marsh wealth per km 2 of preserved land. 23 The net bene\u2026t for a 90-year time horizon is calculated as N B = xv 1 e 90 = 10 6 3 P i l i c i and reported in USD m per representative km 2 of preserved land. 24 A sensitivity analysis with respect to a realistic range of the privatizeable proportion of marsh bene\u2026ts, 0:01 0:15; reveals for the pessimistic case that the di\u00a4erence in net bene\u2026ts between the optimal and observed portfolio range from USD 10:34m to USD 0:08m. As discussed above, this parameter has no impact on the optimal portfolio, only on the bene\u2026ts that are realized."}, {"section_title": "Allowance for Spatial Targeting", "text": "A natural extension of the model is to a case in which spatial targeting of conservation is desired. Although optimal portfolio models alone are not suitable for high-resolution spatial targeting (Ando and Mallory 2014) 25 , the model may be integrated with supplemental analyses that inform such targeting, conditional on land classes and optimal shares identi\u2026ed by the portfolio model. An approach of this type allows one to capitalize on the rich spatial information provided by the underlying biophysical model.\nThis section illustrates such a model extension for the agricultural land class, although a parallel exercise can be conducted for any land type. The approach applies standard performance ratio methods developed within \u2026nancial modeling to select individual assets optimally within asset classes (Farinelli et al. 2008; Sharpe 1994; Stoyanov et al. 2007 ). We illustrate this targeting for marsh conservation using a reward-risk performance ratio ak = ak , where ak is the mean marsh return on individual land area k within land type a (agricultural land), and ak is the corresponding standard deviation. This is equivalent to the Sharpe Ratio compared to a default riskless asset (zero investment) that provides zero marsh return (Sharpe 1994) . Individual land areas within an asset class may be ranked in terms of this performance ratio, enabling these areas to be prioritized in terms of the reward-risk ratio.\nTo illustrate the approach empirically we disaggregate agricultural land in the study site into 30 areas of roughly equal size, each containing a minimum of 600 modelled grid cells, each spaced 30m apart. The performance ratio is calculated for each of these areas following parallel methods to those discussed above. For the sake of conciseness, we illustrate results only for the 0:6m SLR scenario, although analogous results may be generated for any scenario. Under this low-to-moderate SLR scenario, 14 of the 25 Closed-form solutions are infeasible for large number of asset classes, precluding \u2026ne-scale spatial targeting within the portfolio model itself. Similar constraints apply to \u2026nancial models, which provide guidance for diversi\u2026cation over broad asset classes (e.g., stocks, bonds) rather than speci\u2026c investments (e.g., one company's stock). 30 areas are characterized by ak = ak > 0, and would hence be suitable for marsh conservation. Figure 3 shows the reward-risk prioritization for these areas mapped across the case study region, along with information on area elevation in meters.\nAs shown by the portfolio shares in Table 3 , 76% of the optimal portfolio is comprised of agricultural land under the 0:60m SLR scenario.

As the probability of salt marsh conversion increases, so does the optimal share of existing salt marsh in the land conservation portfolio. This rebalancing of the optimal portfolio occurs primarily at the expense of agricultural land shares. The right-hand panel of Figure 4 demonstrates an alternative case where existing marsh is developed with p m = 0:2, agricultural land is always armored (p a = 1) ; while forest is armored with varying probability 0 p f 1:\nIt shows that lower additionality from forest preservation leads to larger shares of agricultural land being held in the optimal land portfolio, as expected. 27 If marsh is allowed to migrate freely on all privately held forest land (p f = 0) and all private farm land is armored (p a = 1), then the optimal portfolio contains no forest land. 28 Figure 4 about here"}, {"section_title": "Summary of Key Results", "text": "The results presented above demonstrate the type of insight that can be provided through systematic consideration of diversi\u2026cation within coastal climate adaptation.\nTheoretical results demonstrate how optimal portfolios respond to biophysical and socio-economic dimensions, including factors such as land costs and characteristics of both the landscape and conservation planners.

Forest land has the lowest share, at a maximum of 0:12 under low SLR.\nResult 3 Policy Relevance: Current conservation strategies may have under-invested in transgression zone land, especially in agricultural land, for which the observed share is 14% compared to 60% 92% for the optimal share.\nResult 4 Bene\u2026ts and Costs: Portfolio optimization yields higher conservation costs per km 2 , but also results in higher marsh bene\u2026ts.

Finally, as emphasized above, the model is designed for a case in which conservation planners wish to identify an optimal portfolio of conservation actions based on information available today. Portfolios can then be rebalanced at any time to accommodate new information as it becomes available. We do not, however, formally consider the optimal timing of marsh conservation decisions, which would require a di\u00a4erent modeling approach and is beyond the scope of the current analysis.\nIn closing, we emphasize that despite the complexity of the underlying mathematics, portfolio models of dynamic, natural assets provide concrete empirical guidance that is readily understood by decision-makers, and for which sensitivity analysis can be conducted.
