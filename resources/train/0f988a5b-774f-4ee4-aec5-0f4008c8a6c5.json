The B&B follows a cohort of students who received bachelor's degrees in 1992-93 and collects data on their post-college experiences as of 1997, approximately four years after graduation. Using the B&B dataset, this study examines the differences in employment statuses, occupational fields, job salaries, graduate/professional school attendance, and participation in voting and other volunteer/community service activities of black bachelor's degree recipients, by institutional type (HBCUs versus non-HBCUs) and sex. Gender variations in post-college experiences are important because African American women account for nearly two-thirds of the degree recipients at both HBCUs and non-HBCU institutions. Tests of statistical significance (at the 0.05 level) are used to measure these comparisons. The data from the B&B show that, in general, African American HBCU graduates had very similar experiences after college as their peers from non-HBCU institutions. A slightly higher proportion of those who got their degrees from black colleges and universities enrolled in graduate/professional programs and received advanced degrees. HBCU graduates were also substantially more likely to participate in community service activities. However, there were important differences in the experiences of the black male and female graduates. Many of these differences were due to variations in the demographic and other characteristics of black men and women who received bachelor's degrees during the study period. Key findings of this study, by sex, are: A higher proportion of African American women who received degrees from HBCUs than non-HBCUs majored in business and marketing (26 percent versus 22 percent); education (12 percent versus 7 percent); and mathematics, engineering, and computer science (8 percent versus 4 percent). Graduates from non-HBCUs were more likely to have majored in health and psychology (17 percent versus 12 percent) and history and social sciences (12 percent versus 11 percent). Black men from HBCUs were more likely to major in education, business/ marketing, mathematics, engineering, and computer science. Black female graduates from HBCUs had significantly higher cumulative undergraduate grade point averages (2.95) than their peers at non-HBCUs (2.70), and were significantly younger at the time of receipt of the bachelor's degree (24.3 years old compared with 27 years old). Among men, the cumulative grade point average for HBCU and non-HBCU degree recipients was the same (2.75), and there was virtually no difference in their average ages (25.7 years old for HBCU graduates versus 26 years old for those from other colleges and universities). A higher percentage of black alumnae from HBCUs were unemployed. In April 1997, nearly 10 percent of the women from black colleges said they did not have jobs, compared with only 2.6 percent of those from non-HBCUs. Differences in unemployment among men were much smaller (4.6 percent for HBCU graduates, 4.2 percent for non-HBCU degree recipients). Among women who were employed, HBCU degree recipients were more likely than their counterparts from other colleges to have jobs that traditionally pay lower salaries, such as teachers (27 percent of HBCU alumnae versus 16 percent of those from non-HBCUs) and clerk/administrative support staff (23 percent versus 19 percent). At the same time, substantially higher percentages of women from non-HBCUs were employed in business/management occupations (24 percent versus 10 percent) and in legal, health, and other professional jobs (21 percent versus 10 percent). There were no large differences in the jobs held by black male graduates of HBCU and non-HBCU institutions. As a result of the differences in occupational fields, African American women from black colleges earned significantly less, on average, than those from non-HBCUs. The mean annual salary of the recent HBCU alumnae who were employed full-time in April 1997 was $24,901, compared with $31,336 for non-HBCU women. Mean earnings from men, on the other hand, were nearly identical ($32,619 for HBCU graduates versus $34,162 for degree recipients from other institutions). Despite their lower salaries, HBCU alumnae were just as likely as their peers from other institutional types to be satisfied with their pay, job challenges, and promotion opportunities. Male graduates from black colleges were also as satisfied with these aspects of their jobs as men from non-HBCUs. A slightly higher (but not statistically significant) share of the women from HBCUs enrolled in graduate/professional schools and achieved master's or higher degrees. Among men, however, a higher but still insignificant share of non-HBCU graduates participated in graduate/professional schools and received advanced degrees. The results suggest that men and women from historically black institutions were just as likely as their peers from other institutional types to attend graduate/professional schools and receive advanced degrees. Men and women from HBCUs were more likely than their counterparts from other institutions to participate in community service. About 57 percent ofAfrican American male graduates from black colleges and universities said they performed volunteer work, compared with only 35 percent of those from non-HBCUs. Approximately 54 percent of black women from HBCUs participated in volunteer work, versus 50 percent of those from other institutions. Black men from HBCUs and non-HBCUs had similar demographic and other characteristics; it is therefore not surprising that their employment and graduate/professional school attendance patterns are similar. Despite these similar characteristics, however, men from black colleges were significantly more likely than their peers from other institutions to participate in community service work. Perhaps their experiences at HBCUs contributed to the males' desires to serve their local areas. Conversely, black women from HBCUs had much different characteristics than their counterparts from other colleges and universities. The differences in ages, college majors, and occupational choices very likely explain much of the variations in earnings. There are other factors that might account for these differences, such as the locations where these women graduates looked for jobs after college and the availability of jobs in the areas the graduates chose to live. The results of this study demonstrate that HBCUs continue to contribute greatly to the successes of African Americans. In the past, higher education policy makers have assumed that blacks would do better after college if they enrolled in traditionally white Introduction ecent attention on the college enrollment experiences of racial and ethnic minority students has focused primarily on students of color who seek to attend predominately or traditionally white institutions through diversity or affirmative action programs (Reisberg, 2000). Unfortunately, the role that historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) play in providing higher education opportunities for African Americans and other low-income students has been virtually ignored. HBCUs represent just 4 percent of all the four-year public and private colleges and universities in the United States, but they enroll 26 percent of all African American undergraduates at four-year institutions, and produce 28 percent of the black bachelor's degree recipients (U.S. Department of Education, 1997a and1997b). At the same time, prior research has suggested that African American students who attend predominately white institutions are more likely than those at black colleges to experience greater levels of social isolation, alienation, personal dissatisfaction, and overt racism (Pascarella and Terenzini, 1991). Given these factors, and in light of the recent decisions by voters, courts, and government officials to eliminate the use of affirmative action for admissions at public colleges in California, Washington, Texas, Florida, and other states (Bakst, 2000;Finn, 2000),' HBCUs could play an even more important role in providing educational access and success for African Americans in the years to come. Thus, higher education analysts who are concerned about educational opportunities for African Americans should acquire more information about the post-college activities of students who receive bachelor's degrees from black colleges. Armed with this information, analysts could compare statistics about those graduates from predominately white or other institutions. Particularly, it is important to know if African Americans who graduate from HBCUs have similar employment opportunities, incomes, and chances to participate in graduate or professional schools as do their counterparts from other types of colleges and universities. Previous research has provided some insights on these issues. For example, Constantine (1995) used data from the National Longitudinal Survey (B & B) of the high school class of 1972 to find that the average hourly wages earned by black graduates who attended and received bachelor's degrees from HBCUs were slightly higher than those from other institutional types. Solorzano (1995) found that more than half of the African Americans who received doctoral degrees in engineering got their baccalaureates from black colleges. This study attempts to update this previous research by using data from the second follow-up of the 1993 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study to compare the post-college experiences of African Americans who received bachelor's degrees in academic year 1992-93 from black colleges with those from other four-year colleges and universities. The Baccalaureate and Beyond dataset allows for comparisons of the experiences of these recent graduates by gender and college type; in the areas of employment status, occupation and job salary, graduate and professional school attendance; and participation in civic activities such as voting and volunteer/community service. Before examining these results, the study briefly describes the survey data and research methodology and provides information on the characteristics of black colleges and the students who attend them. he 1993 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B), conducted by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), tracks the activities of a cohort of college graduates who received their bachelor's degrees during the 1992-93 academic year (generally, at some time between July 1, 1992 and June 30, 1993). Information for the B&B was first collected during the students' final year of college as part of NCES's 1993 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:93). Subsequently, the students were re-interviewed in 1994 and 1997 approximately one and four years after college graduation and asked to report on their employment statuses, job salaries, graduate/professional school enrollments, and other experiences (U.S. Department of Education, 1999a and1999b). Data collected for the second follow-up of the B&B study are based on a cohort of 11,192 individuals,2 statistically weighted to represent the approximately 1.2 million students who had received bachelor's degrees four years earlier. About 1.9 percent of these alumni had graduated from a historically black college or university; more than 80 percent of the HBCU degree recipients were African American. The second follow-up interviews were conducted from April to December 1997 (U.S. Department of Education, 1999b). The survey data discussed in this report are based on the B&B results for African American graduates whose last institution of attendance before receipt of a baccalaureate degree was an institution designated as a historically black college or university by the U.S. Department of Education.' The \"last institution of attendance\" distinction was used to avoid any possible biases that may have resulted from including students who transferred from another type of institution prior to graduation. The analysis is further restricted to include only those graduates who responded to the NPSAS: 93 and the 1994 and 1997 Baccalaureate and Beyond surveys.' Additional information used to describe the demographic characteristics of African American graduates from HBCUs and all other institutions come from the NCES's annual Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) completion and fall enrollment surveys for 1993 and the NPSAS:93 database (U.S. Department of Education, 1993aEducation, , 1993b. In most instances,' this study reports on the employment statuses, occupations, earnings, graduate/professional school attendance, and volunteer/community services activities of black HBCU graduates as of April 1997, compared with African Americans who received their degrees from all other four-year colleges and universities, referred to as non-HBCUs. Non-HBCUs include both predominately or traditionally white institutions and colleges and universities that had large numbers of minority students, but were not classified as HBCUs. These results were generated by using the December 1999 Data Analysis System (DAS), a public-use dataset developed by NCES for analyzing survey results from the second follow-up of the B&B study (U.S. Department of Education, 1999c). Whenever possible, tests of statistical significance (at the 0.05 level)6 are used to compare the mean' employment earnings and other results for African American graduates from HBCUs and non-HBCUs. The significance tests are also used to compare the results by gender in order to evaluate the differences between the experiences of male and female graduates. These tests are used to determine the likelihood that the differences between"}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "BEST COPY AVM lus the graduates' experiences are due to sampling or other statistical anomalies (U.S. , 1999b;Hamburg, 1970).

The majority of these institutions are located in southern anal border states, and were founded during the mid-and late-1800s when most traditionally white institutions would not admit black students (O'Brien and Zudak, 1998). In more recent times, as most institutions have become more racially diverse, many HBCUs have shifted their focus to providing opportunities for low-income students, regardless of their racial/ethnic backgrounds, who are unable to pay the higher cost of attending other four-year colleges. Still, more than 86 percent of the undergraduates enrolled at HBCUs are African American (U.S. Department of Education, 1997a). Many HBCU students are the first in their families to attend higher education, and many more come from low-income families. In 1995-96, about 40 percent of the African American undergraduates at HBCUs were first-generation college students. The median adjusted gross family income of all African American undergraduates at black colleges in 1995-96 was $19,573, and 62 percent came from families with annual income of less than $30,000. About 80 percent of the students received financial assistance to help pay their costs of attending college, compared with 73 percent of those at non-HBCU institutions (U.S. Department of Education, 1999d). The $16,680 median family income of African Americans who received bachelor's degrees from HBCUs in 1992-93 was nearly 18 percent lower than the $19,645 median family income of black graduates from other colleges (U.S. Department of Education, 1999e). A majority of the black colleges were originally founded as \"normal\" schools that sought to provide education and training for students who wanted to become teachers, primarily at racially segregated elementary and secondary schools. As times changed and the roles of these institutions evolved and expanded, they began to provide degrees in liberal arts, humanities, sciences, mathematics, engineering, and many other fields (Redd, 1998)."}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of the 1992-93 African American Bachelor's Degree Recipients", "text": "In 1992-93, there were 106 HBCUs, 90 of which were four-year colleges and universities that awarded at least a bachelor's degree (U.S. Department of Education, 1993a).8 These 90 institutions conferred' 25,884 bachelor's degrees; 84 percent of these degrees were awarded to African Americans. The bachelor's degrees received by the black graduates from HBCUs represented nearly 29 percent of the 76,393 baccalaureates conferred on African Americans at all four-year public and private colleges and universities during the year (U.S. Department of Education, 19936). The overwhelming majority of the black graduates at both HBCUs and non-HBCU institutions were female. As Figure 1  BEST COPY AVAIIABLE the black graduates at HBCUs were women, while 63 percent of those from other types of institutions were female. Conversely, just 54 percent of all bachelor's degrees at all non-HBCUs were awarded to women. These figures demonstrate that black graduates were more likely than degree recipients from other racial and ethnic groups to be women, regardless of institutional type. One reason black women represent a larger share of the African American graduates is that college persistence and graduation rates are higher for females generally and African American females particularly. A recent study by NCES (U.S. Department of Education, 2000) shows that, of the students who had entered college as first-year students in 1989-90, just 29.9 percent of the African American men had received a bachelor's degree by 1994, compared with 37 percent of black women. Nearly 39 percent of the black males had dropped out of college before receiving a baccalaureate degree, versus 36 percent of females "}, {"section_title": "BEST COPY AVAIIABLE", "text": "These education majors represented 10 percent of the bachelor's degrees conferred on African Americans at HBCUs, versus just 6 percent at other institutional types (see Figure  2 on previous page). Education majors are not the only academic disciplines over-represented by HBCU graduates. Approximately 27 percent of the black college degrees were awarded in business and marketing, compared with 23 percent at non-HBCUs, and 11 percent of the baccalaureates from black institutions were awarded in mathematics, engineering, and computer sciences, versus 7 percent at other institutional types. The proportion of degrees conferred also varied by institutional type and sex. A higher percentage of black men who graduated from HBCUs received their degrees in business and marketing (29 percent, compared with 25 percent of males from non-HBCUs) and mathematics, engineering, and computer science (16 percent versus 13 percent). Male graduates from non-HBCU institutions were more likely to major in history and social sciences (16 percent versus 12 percent). Despite their differences in academic majors, black women who received their bachelor's degrees from HBCUs had -significantly-high6r undergraduate grade point averages (GPA) than their counterparts from other institutional types. The 2.95 mean composite GPA for female graduates from black colleges was one-quarter of a gradepoint (or more than 9 percent) higher than the mean for those at other colleges and universities (see Figure 3 on the next page). At the same time, the mean GPA for African American male graduates from HBCUs was identical to that at all other institutions (2.75). As a result of the large difference for women, the cumulative GPA for all HBCU graduates was significantly higher than for graduates from other institutions (2.89 versus 2.72). Constantine (1994) has demonstrated that black undergraduates do better academically at HBCUs than at other institutions because they foster environments that are more supportive of African American students, their students are more involved with campus activities and faculty, and, as a result, their students are more confident. The results from the B&B survey suggest that these factors may have had an even greater effect on black women's academic performance. African American women who graduated from HBCUs were also significantlyyounger than those from other institutions. On average, black women received their degrees from HBCUs when they were 24.3 years old, compared with 27 years ofage for those from "}, {"section_title": "12", "text": "BEST COPY AVAILABLE other four-year colleges and universities (see Figure 4).

About 89 percent of the men who graduated from non-HBCUs held fulltime jobs, compared with 88 percent of those from historically black institutions. Lower employment rates for African American women who graduated from HBCUs may have been due to a wide variety of factors. These include differences in the availability of jobs in the areas where the graduates chose to live after graduation, and differences in the types of jobs these women may have sought during the study period. There is no evidence to suggest that the differences were due to the quality of the education or training that female HBCU and non-HBCU graduates received. Among the African American graduates who were employed, there were also wide variations in the types of jobs held by type of institution. Figure  6 on the next page shows that a higher percentage of the HBCU graduates were employed as teachers (20 percent, versus 15 percent of those from non-BEST COPY AVAIIIARE employed full-time, and 3 percent were working part-time.

Meanwhile, a higher share of the non-HBCU graduates were employed as business managers or executives (21 percent versus 15 percent), and as legal, health, or other professionals (17 percent versus 11 percent). These overall occupational differences were very likely due to the higher share ofAfrican American female graduates from HBCUs who were employed in education positions and clerk/administrative support staff jobs. As Table 3 shows, about 24 percent of the HBCU alumnae were employed as teachers, compared with 16 percent of women from other types of institutions. Approximately 23 percent of black women from HBCUs were employed as clerks and administrative support staff, versus 19 percent of those from other colleges and universities. At the same time, substantially higher percentages of women from non-HBCUs were employed as business and management professionals (24 percent versus 10 percent) and health, legal, and other professionals (21 percent versus 10 percent). It appears that women who attended HBCUs were more likely to become teachers and less likely to enter business and other professions, but due to small sample sizes there is not enough statistical evidence to draw this conclusion definitively. Only 9 percent of the male baccalaureate recipients from HBCUs and other institutional types were employed in clerk/administrafive-support occupations. About 13 percent of the non-HBCU graduates held teaching positions, compared with only 5 percent of those from black colleges. Higher (but statistically insignificant) proportions of the men from HBCUs were in engineering and computer science positions (20 percent versus 12 percent) and business and management jobs (25 percent versus 22 percent). Variations in occupational fields by sex and institutional type should not  \nREST COPT AVAILABLE 15 be unexpected, given the higher share of female graduates from HBCUs who were education majors. However, these differences appear to have attributed to the significantly lower employment earnings of African American alumnae from black colleges. In April 1997, black women who graduated from HBCUs earned, on average, $24,901, compared with $31,336 for women from other institutional types (see Figure  7). The $25,671 mean salary for females from HBCUs who were employed full-time was 19 percent lower than the mean for those from other four-year colleges and universities ($31,799). Two important factors may help explain the substantially lower earnings for African American women who received bachelor's degrees from black colleges and universities.

A greater share of men than women from HBCUs majored in engineering and other fields that usually pay higher salaries. The median starting salary for all male graduates in 1993 (in constant 1997 dollars) was $32,802 for engineering and computer science majors, $26,658 for business and management, and $20,456 for education (U.S."}, {"section_title": "Department of Education, 2000)", "text": ".

As Table 4 on the next page shows, 42 percent of the women from black colleges said they were \"very satisfied\" with the challenges they received from their jobs, compared with 39 percent of their counterparts from other colleges and universities.

So, while a higher percentage of the African American male bachelor's degree recipients from HBCUs appear to have performed many of the duties usually required to begin graduate/professional education (i.e., took the admissions tests and completed the applications) relative to their peers from other institutions, a slightly lower proportion actually enrolled in these programs and completed degrees. Why this occurred is not clear; perhaps employment or personal obligations prevented some of these potential students from enrolling in advanced degree programs. However, these differences are small and not statistically significant, so it is also possible that sampling or other variations may account for the unexpected results. Among the African American baccalaureate recipients who were enrolled in graduate or professional schools, a much higher proportion of degree holders from HBCUs were seeking master's degrees.'3 As Figure 8 shows, 88 percent of the black college graduates who had enrolled in advanced-degree programs were pursuing master's degrees.

Many of the women enrolled in graduate/professional studies from HBCUs appear to be teachers or others in education-related fields. These occupations typically require a master's or higher degree as a prerequisite for licensure or advancement.

What role the HBCUs may have played in these outcomes cannot be measured fully by the B&B survey results, but prior research has shown that the black undergraduates who attend HBCUs do well because of the nurturing environments, small class sizes, and other benefits provided by these institutions. It is possible that these factors may have helped the male students achieve some level of success in the work force. At first glance, the results for African American women who received bachelor's degrees from HBCUs may appear to be just the opposite. These graduates had significantly higher undergraduate GPAs than their counterparts from other institutions. HBCUs also had a higher share of women who received their degrees in mathematics, engineering, and computer science, fields for which women generally and African Americans particularly are under-represented. And a higher percentage of HBCU alumnae also participated in volunteer/civic affairs activities. Unfortunately, the HBCU alumnae also had higher rates of unemployment and significantly lower employment earnings than black women from other types of colleges. These somewhat negative results for the female HBCU degree recipients were most likely due to substantial differences in the graduates' ages, major fields of study, and occupational choices. Women who graduated from black institutions were significantly younger than those from other colleges. Younger people tend to experience higher rates of unemployment and have lower incomes. A higher proportion of female graduates from black colleges also majored in education and entered teaching and other jobs that usually do not pay high salaries, while, at the same time, much higher percentages of women who graduated from non-HBCUs were employed in higher-paying professional occupations. Despite their lower salaries, black women from HBCUs appear to have been just as satisfied with their pay, job challenges, and promotion opportunities as were alumnae from other institutions. A greater share of these women may have been willing to accept jobs that traditionally pay lower wages in order to pursue careers that provided personal and career satisfaction and other non-monetary benefits. Given these results, future discussions on affirmative action and other policies in higher education should recognize the contributions HBCUs play in increasing the odds for economic and social success for African Americans. In the past, diversity efforts by state and federal policy makers have focused primarily on increasing the number of racial and ethnic minorities who enroll in and graduate from predominately white institutions in the belief that these colleges and universities provided the best chances for success for under-represented groups. The B&B data, however, suggest that black graduates from HBCUs can do equally well in employment and other post-college activities as those from other institutions. Government policies should, therefore, focus on encouraging more African Americans to attend and graduate from college, regardless of institutional type. ys, 2' ' In the Hopwood v. Texas, 78F. 3d 932 (5th Cir.) decision of 1996, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that diversity in admissions was not a \"compelling interest\" for colleges to use affirmative action programs. That same year, voters in California and Washington passed amendments to their state constitutions that do not permit their public colleges and universities to use preferences based on race or gender in admissions. In addition, the Florida Board of Regents recently voted unanimously to approve a plan that would abolish the use of affirmative action in its public colleges. These diversity programs will be replaced with the \"One Florida\" plan, which would, beginning in the fall of 2001, guarantee admission to Florida's public four-year colleges and universities for all high school seniors who graduated in the top 20 percent of their graduating classes, regardless of their race/ethnicity. 'For the second follow-up, 11,192 persons were eligible for inclusion in the B&B cohort. Interviews were completed with 10,093 of these individuals. Classification of institutions as \"historically black colleges and universities\" is codified under federal law (20 USCS 1061). See Redd, 1998. Approximately 83 percent of the interviewees had participated in the three surveys. The one exception is for graduate and professional school attendance. Here, the variable used reports the current or most recent level of post-college attendance, in order to calculate the proportions of the 1992-93 baccalaureate recipients who may have participated in graduate or professional school programs prior to April 1997. 6 The comparisons of mean wages and other variables were tested using the Student's t statistics, based on a 5 percent probability of a Type I error (.05 level of significance). A Type I error occurs when one mistakenly concludes that a difference observed in a survey or experimental sample reflects a true difference in the population from which.the sample is drawn. See U.S. Department of Education, 1999b. 'The study reports the arithmetic mean, rather than the average, values for employment earnings and other variables. During the study period, 16 of the HBCUs were public and private two-year colleges that did not award baccalaureate degrees. The data for this report do not include undergraduates from these institutions. Three HBCUs Meharry Medical College, Morehouse School of Medicine, and the Interdenominational Theological Center are graduate and professional schools that do not award baccalaureate degrees. 'The data refer to degrees conferred, rather than degree recipients, because some degree recipients may have majored in two or more fields of study. '\u00b0 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the unemployment rate for persons 25 years old and older who had a bachelor's degree or higher in April 1997 was just 2 percent. The comparisons between the BLS unemployment rates and the percentages of unemployed respondents from the B&B should be judged cautiously, since different survey instruments and samples were used to calculate these rates. However, these rate comparisons do set a context for comparing the employment statuses of B&B respondents with the general U.S. civilian population. \" Unfortunately, the sample sizes from the B&B survey were too small to control for any possible differences in employment earnings by sex, age, and occupation. 12 Some African Americans may have enrolled in programs leading to associate's or second baccalaureate degrees, but, for the purposes of this study, these were not considered graduate or professional programs. \" The data include students who were seeking post-baccalaureate certificates."}]
