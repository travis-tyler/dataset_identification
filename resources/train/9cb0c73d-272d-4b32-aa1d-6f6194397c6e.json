Graduate degree earners have also been shown to exhibit characteristics that lead to improved health, and they tend to have children who are better prepared for primary education and who subsequently attain higher levels of education over their lifetimes (Baum et al., 2010) . Graduate education also provides the key engine for innovation and the discovery of knowledge. Many graduate students work side-by-side with faculty members in the pursuit of knowledge while pursuing their degrees and then carry this work forward both inside and outside the halls of academia (Kallio, 1995; Millett, 2003; Wendler et al., 2010) .\nWhile graduate degrees benefit individuals and society, there remains inequality regarding graduate school attainment for historically underrepresented populations (Perna, 2004) . First-generation, low-income, and minority student populations are less likely than their peers to earn a graduate degree (Morelon-Quainoo et al., 2009) . Without significant and continued improvements in graduate attainment rates for underrepresented populations, it is doubtful that the U.S. will maintain its status as a leader in the global economy (Wendler et al., 2010) . Therefore, it is necessary to continue and expand empirical studies of the factors that influence an individual's decision to pursue graduate education-particularly pertinent is the existing vein of research exploring college choice at the undergraduate level (Perna, 2004) .\nWhile graduate education has consistently grown in both size and importance, theoretically-based scholarly research has lagged considerably behind that afforded to undergraduate college choice (Mullen, Goyette, & Soares, 2003) . The majority of research on graduate choice has either been atheoretical, lacking in strong theoretical underpinnings (Hearn, 1987) , or has focused only on the factors influencing a population at a single institution (Poock & Love, 2001) . While these studies make important contributions to the literature and the field in providing descriptive data on the graduate choice process, they do not help in the understanding of future graduate enrollment behaviors.\nA number of researchers have recently acknowledged this fact, and conducted studies that drew from nationally representative samples (see, for example, Heller, 2001; Millett, 2003; Mullen et al., 2003; Perna, 2004; Zhang, 2005) . These studies provided significant advances to the base of knowledge related to graduate school choice decisions. They are limited, however, in two regards. First, all five studies use the 1992-1993 Baccalaureate and Beyond (B&B:93) study and related follow-up surveys for their data. While there are benefits to this commonality (such as the ability to cross-reference the efficacy of variables and findings), a major drawback is the age of the data. Significant changes have occurred within American higher education and graduate studies in the time since the B&B:93 dataset was created. The costs associated with pursuing post-secondary and graduate education have in-creased dramatically (Millett, 2003) , and financing methods have changed significantly, with an increased focus placed on student loans (Hearn & Holdsworth, 2004) . The second limitation is the continued lack of a theoretical conceptual model for explaining the graduate choice process. Of the five studies referenced above, only Millett (2003) and Perna (2004) firmly ground their study within a theoretical framework derived from the literature. This lack of strong theory development hinders both applied and theoretical applications of the research. This study seeks to fill in the gaps in previous research by applying a sound theoretical framework to a more recent nationally representative dataset.\nThe conceptual model used in this study is an adaptation of the one developed by Perna (2006) in her analysis of undergraduate college choice. It draws from previous college choice research, integrating concepts of habitus, cultural capital, and social capital into the econometric framework of human capital theory. Graduate school choice, which is defined for the purposes of this paper as the decision to pursue any post-baccalaureate degree program at the master's, doctoral-research, or doctoral-professional practice level, is shaped and determined by a number of individual and organizational level characteristics. The conceptual model posits that the graduate school choice process is comprised of three phases. First, an individual develops an aspiration for graduate education; second, the individual submits applications to graduate schools; and third, the individual matriculates into a graduate program.\nThe purpose of this study is twofold: first, to continue the exploration of the impact of individual biographic factors on the decision to pursue graduate school; and second, to assess how undergraduate institutional characteristics influence the graduate school choice process. The study investigates the efficacy of the proposed model by testing the impact that the theorized independent variables have on the dependent actions of aspiring to, applying for, and ultimately enrolling in graduate education. The dataset analyzed is the 2000/01 Baccalaureate & Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:00/01). The nationally representative B&B:00/01 study is comprised of approximately 10,000 students who received a baccalaureate degree from one of the over 1,000 institutions sampled between July 1, 1999 and June 30, 2001 .\nThe following research questions guided the study of graduate school choice:\n1. To what extent do measures of human capital explain graduate school aspiration, application, and enrollment? 2. To what extent do student demographic and background characteristics and the concepts of cultural capital and social capital influence graduate school aspiration, application, and enrollment? 3. To what extent do characteristics of the undergraduate institution influence graduate school aspiration, application, and enrollment?"}, {"section_title": "Background and conceptual Framework", "text": "While considerable research has been devoted to the development and testing of college choice models at the undergraduate level, the concept of college choice for graduate school is less prevalent and somewhat less refined (Mullen et al., 2003) . Research of graduate school enrollment processes has evolved through multiple iterations and approaches; early research, however, was largely descriptive, providing foundational knowledge about who actually pursued graduate study in America (Kallio, 1995) . Later works explored the concept of persistence into graduate study, primarily through the lens of a causal model derived from the work of Pascarella (1984) , Tinto (1975) , and others (Ethington & Smart, 1986) .\nRecent research has begun to situate graduate enrollment choice processes within theoretical models adapted from the established literature on undergraduate college choice (Perna, 2004) . This more recent research explores a number of different variables associated with graduate education, including background characteristics inherent to the student, various aspects of the student's undergraduate institution, the student's undergraduate major, and the total amount of debt the student accumulated while pursuing the baccalaureate degree. Drawing from each of these research threads, this study continues the exploration of the graduate school attendance decision within a model derived from the research on undergraduate college choice. Building from established college choice conceptual models allows current research to frame the student's process of electing to pursue graduate study as a distinct and new choice among many possible post-graduation options."}, {"section_title": "Theoretical Framework", "text": "This study draws from existing literature on college choice and graduate school enrollment and is grounded primarily in the economic framework of human capital theory. Human capital theory has been the most widely used approach for exploring choice decisions related to undergraduate and graduate education (Paulsen & Toutkoushian, 2008) . While human capital theory provides the primary lens for examining graduate school choice decisions in this paper, we explore additional perspectives through the overlay of the concepts of cultural capital and social capital. Recent work by Perna (2004) proposed and validated that the inclusion of cultural capital and social capital concepts in choice models improves their overall efficacy.\nHuman capital is an economic theory that posits that an individual's ability to produce economic value is directly related to the knowledge, skills, and abilities he or she possesses (Becker, 1962) . The theory grew out of economists' conclusion that investments in human capital could have as equally profound an impact on economic productivity as the more traditional concepts of material and physical capital (Cohn & Geske, 1990) . Educational researchers often apply human capital theory as a mechanism for explaining the benefits of obtaining further education, as well as the decision-making process individuals undergo when considering such additional education (Levin, 1989) . Within education economics, human capital theory finds broad usage and adoption in studies that explore issues of choice and decision sets. The theory generally suggests that investment in education results in increased employee competencies, allowing them to contribute at a higher level, and subsequently, demand a higher wage (Thomas & Perna, 2004) . Thus, within the context of graduate school choice, a potential student weighs the perceived set of knowledge and skills that could be obtained in pursuing an advanced degree against the current price of attendance. The decision is shaped by individual preferences and constrained by the individual's budgetary limitations (Paulsen & Toutkoushian, 2008) .\nThe initial research into college choice commonly employed either an econometric or a sociological framework, largely owing to the disciplinary backgrounds of the individual researcher (Hossler, Braxton, & Coopersmith, 1989) . Models began to combine the two approaches rather quickly, as scholars posited that overlaying sociological concepts of human behavior on existing econometric frameworks would better explain the college choice process (Perna, 2006) . Research on choice processes at both the undergraduate and graduate level has moved in this direction in recent years, incorporating the theories of cultural capital and social capital.\nCultural capital is a sociological theory that has received extensive usage in the study of educational outcomes (Reay, 2004) . Cultural capital refers to the broad set of cultural knowledge that an individual acquires from a parent, grandparent, or caregiver (Perna, 2006 ). The extent of the level of acquisition is typically a function of the individual's relationship to the dominant cultural paradigm, manifested in the form of language, activities, artistic experiences, and preferences (Dumais, 2002) . The amount of cultural capital possessed by an individual therefore influences his or her ability to navigate an educational choice process that inherently values the cultural norms perpetuated by the established structure, of which the educational institution is a component (Perna, 2006) .\nA related but distinct concept is social capital theory. Social capital is the network of connections and resources that an individual has access to (Veenstra, 2009) . The individual is then able to capitalize or draw upon those connections and resources in support of an objective, such as an educational choice decision (McDonough, 1997; Sandefur, Meier, & Campbell, 2006) . In the context of educational choice, increased levels of social capital can be tapped to provide insights into the admissions applications process and obtain assistance in the pursuit of financial aid (O'Connor, Hammack, & Scott, 2010; Perna, 2006 ).\nThe theoretical model employed in this study integrates the concepts of cultural and social capital into the established econometric framework of human capital. This integration allows for the use of a rational utility approach while acknowledging and accounting for differences that sociological factors such as gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, geographic location, etc. have on the graduate school choice process. Moreover, the inclusion of cultural capital and social capital theories helps address a number of alternatives to human capital theory that have been advanced to explain the relationship of educational attainment to socioeconomic status, including the theories of screening, signaling, sorting, and credentialism.\nBroadly, these alternative theories question the efficacy of human capital in explaining ties between education, productivity, and employment. Theories such as screening, sorting, and credentialism argue that receipt of additional education acts as a proxy for inherent talents or abilities and that employers use that education as a short-cut in the evaluation of potential employees (Bills, 2003) . The competing theories are similar to human capital, however, in the fact that they posit that the increased educational attainment manifests itself in the form of higher wages (Kjelland, 2008) . As such, researchers have historically found it difficult to empirically test the efficacy of the comparative models (Lang & Kropp, 1986) .\nA number of sociological researchers have found that the theories of screening, sorting, credentialism, etc. provide an attractive alternative to human capital theory, particularly when examining college choice decisions of non-majority and historically underrepresented populations (Bills, 2003) . This is because human capital theory, when applied to educational choice decisions, holds an assumption of student rationality that is not explicitly concerned with factors that shape educational preferences, including race, ethnicity, gender, first-generation college status, etc. These factors, however, hold primary interest for sociology researchers, who have concerns with the equitable allocation of educational and employment outcomes (Perna, 2006) .\nWhile the inclusion of social capital and cultural capital theories in the framework does not address every concern brought forth by advocates of the theories of screening, signaling, and credentialism, it does ameliorate a number of the issues by taking into account students' backgrounds, origins, and available resources. Studies at both the undergraduate and graduate level of the choice process have found that the inclusion of cultural and social capital constructs in the traditional econometric framework improves the explanatory power of the model (Perna, 2000; Perna, 2004) .\nThe theoretical model advanced in this paper posits that cultural capital and social capital are used by an individual consistent with his or her habitus. The concept of habitus has received substantial attention within the study of educational choice processes, and is most often drawn from the work of Bourdieu (Reay, 2004) . In this application, the habitus is conceptualized as the internal set of perceptions and beliefs about the world an individual has, inclusive of their place in that world (Dumais, 2002) . Educational researchers have advanced the use of habitus in educational choice decisions as a way of contextualizing the extent to which a student's lived experiences \"fit\" with the expectations of the college or university (Nora, 2004) .\nThe model is derived from the work of Perna (2006) , who advanced a model of college choice that incorporated the concepts of habitus, cultural capital, and social capital into a traditional rational utility human capital structure. Perna (2006) drew from McDonough's (1997) work that put forth an organizational habitus comprised of various resources and social structures that influence choice processes. This concept of habitus is comprised of the student's gender, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. The habitus also operationalizes the concepts of cultural and social capital as related to choice processes manifested through a human capital investment decision. Perna (2006) posited that the habitus, inclusive of various measures of cultural and social capital, shapes the ways in which an individual approaches and considers an enrollment choice decision. The habitus, conceptualized as an internal schema of thoughts, beliefs, and perceptions, is directly formed and influenced by the environment in which an individual exists and is unique to that individual (Perna, 2006) . As such, each individual experiences and navigates the choice process differently, from within their own situated context."}, {"section_title": "Conceptual Model", "text": "The conceptual model advanced in this paper is adapted from the one developed by Perna (2006) for use in analyzing undergraduate college choice decisions. Perna's model situated the decision of whether to enroll in college as a decision nested inside four discrete contextual layers: social, economic, and policy context (layer 4); higher education context (layer 3); school and community context (layer 2); and habitus (layer 1). An individual's analysis of expected benefits and costs is shaped by the four layers when determining whether to pursue a baccalaureate degree, and are simultaneously influenced and constrained by demand factors for higher education and availability of resources.\nAt its core, Perna's (2006) model focuses on the human capital, cultural capital, and social capital theories. We theorize that these three components of the model, as included in the habitus layer, are still in effect in the graduate school context, although the specific variables used to measure those components are necessarily different. For instance, a student's undergraduate major is a measure of human capital in the graduate school model, and this variable obviously was not included in Perna's original model that focused on the transition from secondary to postsecondary education. The model is therefore adapted in this study to allow for the examination of the graduate school choice process. We update various components of the habitus to reflect the transition from undergraduate education to graduate education, as opposed to the secondary to post-secondary transition originally posited by Perna (2006) . The second layer is modified from a school and community context to now encapsulate the effects of the undergraduate institution the student attended. The third layer now focuses on the graduate school context, instead of higher education, and the fourth layer remains the social, economic, and policy context.\nThe conceptual model posits that a student's situated position within the four contextual layers shapes their decision to pursue graduate education. That decision manifests itself in the form of the graduate school choice process, which is comprised of three nested phases. First, a student develops an aspiration to obtain a graduate-level degree. Next, the student takes the active step of submitting applications to graduate schools. Enrollment in a graduate degree program constitutes the final phase of the process.\nThis conceptual model extends Perna's (2006) previous work by modifying an approach designed to model undergraduate college choice and applying it in the study of graduate school choice. We believe the model, previously shown to facilitate higher levels of predictive power, fits well within the graduate school frame. The outlined changes to the model specifically address and account for the differences that exist between graduate school choice and undergraduate college choice decisions.\nThe use of this model, appropriately modified to fit the graduate school choice process, facilitates a conceptual structuring and operationalizing of the theories of habitus, human capital, cultural capital, and social capital (Perna, 2006) . We limited this study to an examination of only the first two layers of the conceptual model (Habitus and Undergraduate Institution Context), as we wanted to isolate the individual and institutional level variables in analyzing their effects via the multilevel models. As the model suggests, this study examines the intersection of an individual's background characteristics with the traits inherent to the institution from which the individual received their baccalaureate degree. By doing so, it is one of the first studies to explicitly explore the varying influences that an individual's biographic and demographic attributes and undergraduate institutional characteristics have on the decision to pursue a graduate degree. The operative two-level model is presented as Figure 1 ."}, {"section_title": "Variable Selection", "text": "The decision of which variables to include for analysis in the conceptual model was informed by a thorough review of previous research into graduate school choice. As a number of common independent variables exist in the current literature, we examined those most salient to the theoretical model adapted from Perna's (2006) analysis of undergraduate college choice processes. Specifically, we look at the first two layers of the conceptual model, the habitus and the undergraduate institution context, and their impact on the human capital investment decision, which is the core of the model.\nThe center of the conceptual model proposed by Perna (2006) and adapted for use in exploring graduate school choice processes is the human capital investment decision. Higher undergraduate grade point averages consistently and positively affect graduate enrollment decisions (Fox, 1992; Heller, 2001; Millett, 2003; Zhang, 2005) , and undergraduate major has regularly influenced the demand for graduate education (Heller, 2001; Mullen et al., 2003; Zhang, 2005) . Of particular interest for this study was the difference in how Perna (2004) and Millett (2003) operationalized undergraduate major in their respective analyses of graduate school choice. Millett (2003) categorized undergraduate majors according to the Biglan system, which defines fields as either pure or applied. Her study posited and found that students who completed a pure undergraduate major were twice as likely to apply to graduate school than those who pursued an applied field. Perna (2004) , however, employed a strict human capital classification, and considered the undergraduate major as a proxy for expected foregone earnings when enrolling in graduate school, finding a connection between lower expected earnings and higher rates of graduate school enrollment.\nThe total amount of debt the student has accumulated at the undergraduate level and the potential wages the student would forego by enrolling in graduate school moderate that demand. The impact of undergraduate debt has been explored extensively in the literature (Ekstrom, Goertz, Pollack, & Rock, 1991; Fox, 1992; Heller, 2001; Millett, 2003; Perna, 2004; Schapiro, O'Malley, & Litten, 1991; Weiler, 1991) , with little to no consensus found concerning whether debt has a positive impact, a negative impact, or no impact on the graduate school choice process (Millett, 2003) .\nThe first contextual layer of the adapted Perna (2006) model, the habitus, contains the individual-level student demographic variables of race, ethnicity, and gender. Previous research into graduate school choice has shown males to be more likely than females (Hearn, 1987; Weiler, 1991) and underrepresented minority students to be less likely than their peers (Johnson, 1996; Millett, 2003; Poock & Love, 2001; Zhang, 2005) to pursue graduate education. These are not consensus findings, however, as Perna (2004) found females to be more likely than males to enroll in masters level programs, but less likely to enroll in doctoral level programs. Perna (2004) and Millett (2003) have also shown that African-American and Hispanic/ Latino students are more likely to pursue graduate education when accounting for all other variables in their respective models.\nThe conceptual model adapted from Perna (2006) next incorporates approximations of cultural capital and social capital in the analysis of graduate school choice. The analysis of secondary datasets such as the Baccalaureate and Beyond study are very limited in their direct measures of cultural and social capital; indirect approximations are therefore used to attempt to account for these considerations in the conceptual model (Perna, 2004) . Variables previously analyzed in the literature include the parents' highest level of education (Hearn, 1987; Fox, 1992; Millett, 2003; Pascarella, 1984; Perna 2004; Weiler, 1991) , parents' income (Millett, 2003; Zhang, 2005) , parents' contributions towards tuition costs (Perna, 2004) , and whether English was the primary language spoken in the home (Perna, 2004) . Finally, the variables of high school type and whether the student attended college at an out-of-state institution (Perna, 2004) are included as proxies for social capital. Perna (2004) theorized that students who attended an undergraduate institution outside of their state of residence would have access to broader social networks, and thus greater exposure to graduate opportunities. The same rationale applies to the concept that attending a private high school would indicate greater access to broad social networks.\nThe second contextual layer of the model adapted from Perna (2006) includes variables related to the undergraduate institution. Characteristics of the undergraduate institution attended, such as institutional control and Carnegie classification, have frequently appeared in the literature (DeAngelo, 2009; Mullet et al., 2003; Perna, 2004; Zhang, 2005) . We also explore whether attending a Historically Black College or University (HBCU) influences the three phases of the graduate school choice process. These institutional characteristic variables also provide key insights on the influence of social capital in the graduate school choice process (Perna, 2004) .\nWhile institutional selectivity has frequently been included as a proxy for institutional quality in previous studies (Fox, 1992; Millett, 2003; Mullet et al., 2003; Zhang, 2005) we excluded it from our analysis after reviewing a number of articles that question the rationale of accepting institutional selectivity as a proxy for the academic quality of the institution. In their analysis of selectivity and educational quality, Kuh and Pascarella (2004) noted that measures of institutional selectivity are typically determined largely by average SAT/ACT scores. Their analysis found institutional selectivity to be weakly associated with the quality of the student's undergraduate education. A similar analysis was conducted by Pascarella et al. (2006) , finding that institutional admissions selectivity served as a poor signal for the quality of a student's undergraduate education, and was perhaps indicative of why the majority of previous research failed to find a significant association between the two measures. While we did not include institutional selectivity, we did explore whether the cohort graduation rate of the student's undergraduate institution affected the graduate school choice process."}, {"section_title": "Dependent Variables", "text": "For the purposes of this study, graduate school choice refers to the three-phase process of aspiration, application, and enrollment by which an individual makes the determination to pursue a post-baccalaureate degree, at either the master's or doctoral (research or professional practice) level. As the focus of this study is on exploring the impacts of individual and institutional characteristics on graduate education in general, the dependent variable of interest is not divided into various graduate degree disciplines and types (e.g., non-terminal masters, terminal masters, doctoral-research, doctoral-professional practice). While there are certainly a number of differences that exist between those graduate degrees, a full examination of their manifestations is beyond the scope of this study.\nWe conceptualize the graduate school choice process as being comprised of three nested phases. First, a student develops an aspiration for pursuing a graduate degree. Next, the student submits applications to graduate school. Lastly, the student enrolls in a graduate program. As such, the dependent variables of interest were derived from the B&B:2000/01 variable Graduate School Pipeline (GRDPIP). This variable contained information about a student's progression through a hypothetical pipeline of graduate education (no plans to attend graduate school, plans graduate school in the future, applied for graduate school, accepted to graduate school but not enrolled, and enrolled in graduate school).\nWe derived three dichotomous dummy variables from this initial variable: graduate school aspiration (GRAD_ASP); graduate school application (GRAD_APPLY); and graduate school enrollment (GRAD_ENROLL). These dummy variables were created by \"rolling down\" all higher-level responses. Graduate school enrollment was coded \"1\" only for those students enrolled in a graduate program; graduate school application was coded \"1\" if the student responded that they had either applied for, been accepted to, or enrolled in graduate school; and graduate school aspiration was coded \"1\" for all students who responded that they planned to attend graduate school, as well as those that had applied for, been accepted to, or enrolled in graduate school.\nIn summary, the individual and societal benefits of obtaining a graduate degree are significant, and it is believed that this study advances the understanding of not only the variables that impact the decision to pursue graduate study, but also the actual choice processes as they exist in established theoretical frameworks."}, {"section_title": "analytical approach", "text": "This study uses data from the 2000/01 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:2000/01). The B&B: 2000/01 study was conducted on behalf of the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), an agency within the U.S. Department of Education's Institute of Education Sciences (Charleston, Riccobono, Mosquin, & Link, 2003) . The Baccalaureate and Beyond research report serves as the NCES's primary tool for studying the lives and post-graduation activities of baccalaureate recipients, inclusive of graduate education, work experiences, financial situations, and personal experiences (Charleston et al., 2003) "}, {"section_title": "Missing Data", "text": "The analysis showed that the 10,030 student records were distributed across 690 undergraduate institutions. Our first objective was to address the issue of missing data within the dataset; we used multiple imputation procedures to handle item-missing data. A fully conditional specification model that applied the appropriate sample weights as directed by NCES was employed to generate a set of ten imputed datasets. Van Buuren (2007) conducted simulations testing the efficacy of this fully conditional approach and found that when the traditional joint modeling approach was infeasible (due to the inclusion of non-normal independent variables), the fully conditional approach yielded less bias. We accounted for the clustered sample design by including the undergraduate institution ID as a predictor value in the multiple imputation procedure, as recommended Reiter, Raghunathan, and Kinney (2006) . Although an approach that explicitly modeled the multilevel structure would have been preferred, the methodology employed in this paper is more sophisticated than the alternative approaches taken in previous graduate school choice studies (e.g., Millet, 2003; Mullen et al., 2003; Perna, 2004 : Zhang, 2005 .\nWhile early research into multiple imputation recommended the generation of five to ten datasets, more resent analyses have suggested that 20 or more implicates is appropriate (Schafer & Graham, 2002) . We ultimately selected to generate ten imputed datasets for the multilevel analysis, as that is the maximum number that HLM 7 is able to process. This limitation informed our decision to include the dependent variable in the imputation process but then delete all cases in which its value had been originally missing (Allison, 2002) . This approach is known as multiple imputation, then deletion (MID), and has been shown to offer more efficient estimates (von Hippel, 2007) . Both von Hippel (2007) and Young and Johnson (2010) recommended this approach when the number of imputed datasets is small. This resulted in a reduction of the sample size from 10,030 to 9,770."}, {"section_title": "Modeling Strategy", "text": "The methodology employed in this paper is generalized hierarchical linear modeling with a binomial distribution and a logit link, in which students are nested within an undergraduate institution. The generalized hierarchical linear model is a type of multilevel model that is useful when individuals are situated within an institution and the dependent variable of interest is not continuous (Heck, Thomas, & Tabata, 2010) . The generalized hierarchical linear model employed in this paper is appropriate for two reasons, one technical and the other theoretical. First, the sampling methodology employed in the construction of the B&B:2000/01 was a multi-stage design, in which institutions were first selected and students were subsequently drawn from that set. As such, one of the common and required assumptions of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, independence of observations (also referred to as uncorrelated disturbances), has been violated (Allison, 1999) . If a standard OLS regression model were used and the clustered nature of the data was not accounted for, it is possible that the analysis would yield standard errors that are too small, increasing the chance of receiving a Type I error. (Garson, 2011) .\nThe use of a multi-level modeling approach is also of theoretical benefit. As OLS regression only allows for the modeling of variance at a single level, it would be impossible to jointly model the impact of both individual and institutional level effects on the graduate school choice process simultaneously. Multi-level modeling, however, can concurrently explore the impact of individual and institutional effects because the beta coefficients are not treated as fixed effects, as in OLS, but as random effects drawn from a normal distribution of betas (Garson, 2011) . We grand-mean centered all variables included in the analysis. This transforms the interpretation from being based on the raw score of interest to being based upon an observed values' deviation from the mean of all values in the dataset (Luke, 2004) . All models were weighted at both levels of analysis. The NPSAS institutional variable INSTWT was selected as the level-two weight, while the derived weight STU_WT was specified at level one. The STU_WT variable was calculated by dividing the analysis weight (BB01AWT) by the institution weight (INSTWT) (Pfeffermann, Skinner, Homes, Goldstein, & Rasbash, 1998)."}, {"section_title": "Cluster Size Considerations", "text": "The number of students sampled from any specific undergraduate institution varied from a low of one student to a high of 91. Multilevel modeling requires a sufficient number of level-two clusters, as well as a satisfactory number of level-one units contained within each cluster (Heck et al., 2010) . The decision of which cut point to use for removal of institutions with small sample sizes depends primarily on the analytical objectives of the study (O'Connell, Goldstein, Rogers, & Peng, 2008) . As such, we elected to remove any institution in the sample containing less than five students from the dataset, as our primary objective was to examine the regression coefficients in the multilevel models (Hox, 2010) . The work of Meinck & Vandeplas (2012) further informed this decision. They conducted an empirical simulation evaluating sample size requirements in hierarchical linear models, finding that smaller sample sizes were of less concern when estimating fixed model parameters, and that large level-two sample sizes helped limit the overall residual variance generated by small level-one sample sizes.\nThe decision to delete only institutions with fewer than five students was also motivated by the large amounts of additional data that would have been lost by increasing the threshold. For example, deleting all institutions with fewer than ten students would have resulted in a loss of 270 institutions and 1,240 students; a 20 student threshold would have increased these figures to 520 institutions and 4,800 students. Our final decision to delete institutions with fewer than five students resulted in a reduction of 125 undergraduate institutions and 260 student records. The final dataset prepared for analysis, therefore, contained 9,480 students nested within 560 undergraduate institutions."}, {"section_title": "Model Estimation", "text": "We conducted three separate sets of generalized hierarchical linear models to explore the influence of individual and institutional factors on the three phases of the graduate school choice process of aspiration, application, and enrollment. As the dependent variable of interest in each of these models was dichotomous (aspire/not aspire, apply/not apply, enroll/not enroll) the dependent measure was transformed into a form that would allow a linear modeling of the independent variables of interest. All output contained in this paper was estimated via an adaptive Gaussian quadrature approach and is provided in the unit-specific format with robust standard errors. The adaptive-Gaussian quadrature approach uses numerical integration to approximate full maximum likelihood methods in generalized hierarchical linear models (Pinheiro & Bates, 1995) . The adaptive-Gaussian quadrature method of is computationally intensive but has been shown to produce consistent and asymptotically unbiased estimates (Raudenbush, Yang, & Yosef, 2000) . Yosef (2001) and Johnson (2006) also found the adaptiveGaussian quadrature approach to perform very well when cluster sizes were small in Bernoulli models and Poisson models, respectively. This strong performance with small cluster sizes informed our decision to select the adaptive-Gaussian quadrature approach, as our cut-point of no fewer than five-students per undergraduate institution still allowed for relatively small level-two cluster sizes."}, {"section_title": "Model Building", "text": "We tested for multicollinearity before beginning the process of constructing the multilevel models. We found that all independent variables included in the analysis exhibited variance inflation factors smaller than two, which indicated that multicollinearity was not a cause for concern (Mertler & Vannatta, 2010) . We next calculated the intraclass correlation (ICC) using the formula outlined by Snijders and Bosker (1999) for use in situations where the dependent variable of interest is dichotomous. We calculated an ICC (proportion of variance explained by undergraduate institution) of 12.62% for the aspiration model, 7.15% for the application model, and 6.69% for the enrollment model. While this may seem like a trivial amount of variation to attempt to model via a multilevel approach, Porter and Swing (2006) argue that there are a number of reasons to take this approach. First, quantitative survey research rarely explains more than 30% of the variance observed; as such, the variance witnessed here is not an insignificant amount. They also note that small ICC calculations have not limited prior educational research and that it is still possible to find independent variables that influence the dependent variables of interest.\nWe next created the full within-institution model. This model, also known as the level-one individual model, or the random intercept model, included all level-one variables in the analysis, along with a randomly varying (by institution) intercept. At level-one we included a series of variables that represented various demographic characteristics and aspects of cultural and social capital (see Table 1 for descriptive statistics of all variables included in the models). The next step in the model-building process was to construct the full model, which allows the intercept to vary as a function of a set of level-two predictor variables. The level-two variables included in each of the models (aspiration, application, and enrollment) include whether the student's undergraduate institution was an HBCU, the institution's cohort graduation rate, the institution's control (public/private/for-profit), and the institution's Carnegie Classification. Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for individual-level variables included in the models. Of the 9,480 students included in the final analysis, 83% indicated that they aspired to graduate education. Approximately one third had applied for graduate school, and just over one quarter were actually enrolled in a graduate program. There were substantially more females than males in the weighted sample used for analysis, with 58% female and 42% male. White, non-Hispanic students represented nearly three quarters of the sample. The largest group of students (34%) majored in the humanities or social/behavioral sciences; the second largest category belonged to business/management majors."}, {"section_title": "results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Descriptive Analysis", "text": "Examination of the level-two (undergraduate institution) descriptive statistics revealed a number of interesting facets of the Baccalaureate and Beyond 2000/01 Longitudinal Study data (see Table 2 ).

Graduates of master's institutions comprised the second largest cohort at approximately 36%; students from baccalaureate colleges (liberal arts and general) represented only 12% of the total population. The majority of students (66%) graduated from a public institution, while one third completed their baccalaureate degree at a private not-for-profit college or university.

Compared to the reference category of having majored in business/management, students who studied in the humanities, social sciences, behavioral sciences, mathematics, and life or physical sciences were consistently more likely to aspire to, apply for, and enroll in graduate school. Education majors were more likely to aspire to graduate school, but did not differ significantly from business students when comparing their rates of applying to or enrolling in graduate school. Students who majored in computer or information sciences, engineering, health related fields, or any other major did not significantly differ from business students at any stage of the graduate school pipeline."}, {"section_title": "Multilevel Models", "text": "A student's undergraduate academic performance, as measured by their cumulative grade point average, is significantly related to graduate school aspiration, application, and enrollment. We found the association was at its weakest point in graduate school aspiration, and at its strongest in the graduate school enrollment model. The amount of debt a student accumulated while completing the baccalaureate degree was theorized to have a negative influence on graduate school aspiration, application, and enrollment. However, we did not find student debt nor Parent/PLUS loans to be statistically significant (p < .05) variables at any stage of the graduate school process. Our examination of demographic variables found that gender was not significantly related with graduate school aspiration, application, or enrollment. The category of student race was split into a set of six dummy variables, with white students established as the reference category. Only African-American students differed significantly from their white peers at each phase of the graduate school choice process. African-American students were consistently and significantly more likely to aspire to, apply for, and enroll in graduate school, when accounting for all other variables in the model. Hispanic and Latino students were significantly more likely to aspire to and apply for, but not enroll in, graduate school.\nWe tested a number of indirect approximations of cultural capital and social capital in the model. The highest education level obtained by a student's parent influenced graduate school choice decisions. Individuals whose parents completed the baccalaureate were more likely to apply for graduate school, and students whose parents completed the master's degree were more likely to apply for and enroll in graduate school than those whose parents obtained the high school diploma or less. Compared to the reference category of being a dependent student with a family income less than $29,000, no other student dependency classifications with higher family incomes were significantly more likely to aspire to, apply for, or enroll in graduate school. However, independent students with large annual incomes (greater than $50,000) were significantly less likely to aspire to, apply for, or enroll in graduate education.\nThe language most commonly spoken in the student's home is another factor that serves as an indirect measure of cultural capital in graduate school preferences; we did not find any difference with regards to graduate school aspiration, application, or enrollment depending on whether English was the primary language spoken in the home or not. We also modeled the amount of tuition assistance that a student's parents or relatives provided for their undergraduate education. Compared to the reference category of not receiving any tuition assistance, none of the other categories significantly differed at any of the three phases of the graduate school choice process.\nThree categories of high school type were included as a proxy for social capital and access to varying networks of connections: public high schools, private high schools, and foreign high schools. However, we found no statistically significant difference on graduate school aspiration, application, or enrollment for graduates of any of the three types of high schools. We also explored whether attending an undergraduate institution in a state other than the one in which the student held residency was a means of accounting for differing social networks. We found no statistically significant differences, however, when examining a student's residency for baccalaureate attendance.\nLiterature on graduate school choice often focuses on the role of characteristics of the institution an individual attended for the baccalaureate degree.\nAs that prior research failed to account for the nested and hierarchical structures inherent in choice decisions, the studies often modeled characteristics of the undergraduate institution at the first (and only) level of the analysis. Variables included in this study indicate whether the student's undergraduate institution was public, private not-for-profit, or private for-profit. We also included a modification of the collapsed Carnegie Classification, with institutions separated into doctoral/research universities, master's universities, baccalaureate colleges (liberal arts and general), and \"other institutions\" (e.g., specialized schools). We found that students that attended an institution classified as \"other\" were roughly half as likely as their peers that attended a doctoral/research university to aspire to, apply for, and enroll in graduate school. Students who attended a baccalaureate institution were roughly three quarters as likely to apply for and enroll in graduate school as those who attended a doctoral/research university. We found no statistically significant difference between graduates of public, private, or for-profit institutions.\nWe also examined whether or not students who attended an institution with high graduation rates were more likely to engage in graduate school choice processes. We failed to find a significant relationship between a student's undergraduate institutional graduation rate and graduate school aspiration, application, or enrollment. We also included a variable in the model that indicated if the student attended a historically black college or university. Attending an HBCU was not significantly associated with graduate school processes."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "This study employed multilevel modeling methods in the examination of graduate school choice processes. The conceptual model advanced in this study was adapted from Perna's (2006) development of an overarching conceptual framework for exploring undergraduate college choice decisions that included the theories of habitus, human capital, cultural capital, and social capital. We begin by exploring the limitations of the study, and then describe the advantages that this study presents to the literature.\nFirst, the findings of this study are limited by the age of the dataset used in the analysis. The 2000/01 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study was over ten years old when this study was conducted, which limits the extent to which the findings can be generalized. American higher education is a dynamic field, and substantive changes have occurred in the last decade concerning access, affordability, and student success.\nThis study is also limited in that only captures graduate choice application and enrollment decisions one year after the student's completion of the baccalaureate degree. A number of fields (e.g., business, education) often require that students obtain work experience prior to enrolling in a graduate program, and this study cannot account for those factors.\nAn additional limitation of this study was the lack of well-defined measures of habitus, cultural capital, and social capital. In her previous analysis of the 1993 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study, Perna (2004) noted that a key limitation of her study was the lack of variables that directly measure cultural capital or social capital, and called for an inclusion of those types of variables in future iterations of the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study. Unfortunately, that clarion call was issued after this version (B&B:2000/01) of the study had already been completed; we were therefore forced to model many of the same imperfect approximations that Perna explored in 2004. The lack of direct measures of habitus, cultural capital, and social capital makes it significantly more difficult to determine the actual effects that those concepts have on the graduate school choice process. It is possible that the indirect measures used in this study, while derived from prior research, are not strong approximations of students' habitus nor their actual accumulated cultural capital and social capital as related to the attendant power structures inherent to the graduate school choice process.\nAll graduate programs were collapsed in this study into a single metric that facilitated the testing of the multilevel theoretical model. While this approach allowed for a more focused and concise assessment of the three phases of the graduate school choice process, it masks differences that exist between the various post-baccalaureate programs. Future research should build upon the theoretical model advanced in this study by incorporating multiple discreet graduate degree program options as the dependent variable of interest. Previous single level regression modeling revealed substantial differences by program type (e.g., master's, doctoral-professional practice, doctoral-research), and future research should explore those differences via the multilevel modeling strategy advanced in this study."}, {"section_title": "discussion", "text": "A review of the established literature on both college choice and graduate school choice processes not only provided a framework for the existing knowledge on the topic, but also revealed the questions that still exist. This study extends research on the graduate school choice process in several unique and meaningful ways. It has also helped to reveal a number of areas that are ripe for future research and analysis, and provided refinements to the theoretical underpinnings of graduate school choice research. We organize our discussion into two sections. First, we explore the findings as it relates to the theorized human capital investment decision. We next look at how the findings relate to the theories of habitus, cultural capital, and social capital. We also discuss how our findings relative to the second layer of the conceptual model, the undergraduate institution context, intersect with findings from the first layer of the model."}, {"section_title": "Human Capital", "text": "Drawing from the work of Perna (2006), we posited that a human capital investment decision resides at the core of the graduate school choice process. The conceptual model theorizes that individuals weigh the expected monetary benefits and costs of graduate education and select the option that maximizes their utility. Our findings largely support that assertion, with one key area of difference.\nResearchers have frequently explored student's undergraduate academic performance in the graduate school choice literature. Heller (2001 ), Millett (2003 , Mullen, Goyette, and Soares (2003) , and Zhang (2005) all found a significant positive relationship between a student's academic achievements and their proclivity for graduate school. Not surprisingly, the results of this analysis confirm the established body of literature, finding that students with higher levels of exhibited academic performance would be more likely to aspire to, apply for, and enroll in graduate education. This is consistent the expectations of the human capital investment decision, as higher academic performance was theorized to increase the demand for graduate education.\nWhile the finding that students with higher undergraduate grade point averages are more likely to pursue graduate education seems logical and benign, there are a number of subtle interpretations of interest. First, while the results of this study did find a student's undergraduate GPA to be a significant predictor of the graduate school choice phases of aspiration, application, and enrollment, those findings were stronger in association at each subsequent phase of the graduate school pipeline. While we draw comparisons between the models with caution, it is useful to examine differences in coefficients and odds ratios. At the point of graduate school aspiration, moving one standard deviation (.495) from the mean undergraduate GPA of 3.163 resulted in the student being 1.20 times as likely to aspire to graduate school. This odds ratio increased to 1.25 times as likely at the point of graduate school application, and 1.35 times as likely at the point of graduate school enrollment.\nThis increase in the strength of this association as the individual progresses through the graduate school choice process potentially highlights a disconnect between that individual's aspiration and their own academic ability. While a student's academic achievement is positively associated with all three steps of the graduate school process (aspiration, application, and enrollment), the fact that the magnitude of that association is larger at the point of applying and enrolling in graduate school highlights the importance of GPA in determining actual graduate school attendance. For instance, an individual who aspires to graduate school might determine when reviewing admissions requirements that they do not fall into a competitive range of potential applicants, and thus decides not to pursue a graduate program. While this study cannot conclusively determine a relationship between the models of aspiration, application, and enrollment, it does point to a potential area of future research.\nA key component of human capital theory, as applied to graduate school choice, is that students will weigh the potential benefits of pursuing a graduate degree against the earnings they forego by not participating in the workforce. As the Baccalaureate and Beyond 2000/01 Longitudinal Study captured information only one year after a student received the baccalaureate degree, the undergraduate major provides a strong proxy for measuring these opportunity costs (Perna, 2004) .\nBusiness majors were consistently less likely than their peers who majored in the humanities, social sciences, behavioral sciences, mathematics, life sciences, and physical sciences to aspire to, apply for, and enroll in graduate education. Business majors were also significantly less likely to aspire to graduate school than education majors, although no statistical difference existed between the two groups at the point of graduate school application or graduate school enrollment. These findings are consistent with the established body of graduate school choice literature (Heller, 2001; Millett, 2003; Mullen et al., 2003; Zhang, 2005) . While the findings of this study largely support the prior body of research examining the impact of a student's undergraduate major on the various processes involved with the pursuit of a graduate degree, there are a number of details worth exploring in more depth. Perna (2004) and Millett (2003) proposed two distinct conceptual approaches for considering the role that a student's undergraduate major has on determining graduate school choice processes. Perna (2004) chose to group the various undergraduate majors into four categories based upon expected starting salaries. The lowest quartile included education, history, and psychology; the second quartile was comprised of humanities, social sciences, public affairs, social services, and other; the third quartile included business and management majors; and the highest quartile included math, other sciences, health professions, and engineering.\nMillett (2003), however, adapted the Biglan system, dividing the majors into two discrete categories, pure and applied. The pure category of major included fields such as chemistry, biology, foreign languages, and the humanities; the applied category was comprised of business, engineering, education, and health professions. The conceptual rationale for this dichotomization of majors is based on the theory that pure fields have an increased expectation and inherent requirement for graduate study, whereas the applied fields are designed to prepare an individual for immediate work, with a much lower need for graduate education.\nThe results of this study align more with Millett's (2003) conceptual analysis than Perna's (2004) . We selected business majors as the reference category because of its relatively high-expected starting salaries (Zhang, 2005) and the inherently low expectations for graduate study (Millett, 2003) . Since business majors would be expected to exhibit lower levels of proclivity for graduate education under both Millett's (2003) and Perna's (2004) framework, it allowed us to directly examine the interplay of expected earnings and inherent demand for graduate school in other major classifications.\nThe only categories of undergraduate major that were statistically different from business at each of the three phases of the graduate school process were the humanities/social/behavioral sciences and mathematics/life/physical sciences. All of these majors showed an increased likelihood of aspiring to, applying for, and enrolling in graduate school than business majors. Our results echo the finding of Millett (2003) , who classified all of these majors as pure. While Perna (2004) classified humanities/social/behavioral sciences as lower earning majors, mathematics and the life/physical sciences were a subset of the highest earning quartile. Human capital theory would expect those students with the highest expected starting salaries to pursue graduate education at a lower percentage; the findings of this study do not support that concept directly. Additionally, at the point of graduate school application and graduate school enrollment, all of the majors classified as applied by Millett (computer/information sciences, engineering, health, vocational/technical/ professional/other) showed no significant difference from business majors.\nGiven that our multilevel models accounted for the students' earnings and financial resources, we further tested this finding by re-running all three of our models without any measures of student income. By doing so, we removed the control for dependency status and income that had been included in the full multilevel models, and explored the relationship between undergraduate major and graduate degree plans and aspirations in a more direct manner.\nWe found no difference between these reduced models and the original full models that accounted for income. The same undergraduate majors that were significantly associated with graduate school aspiration, application, and enrollment in the full model remained influential in the reduced model. As such, it appears that the type of undergraduate major matters more than the earnings potential when modeling graduate school choice behaviors one year after completion of the baccalaureate. Given that over 50% of the sample classified themselves as dependent students, these findings make logical sense. An individual who is still reliant upon a parent or guardian for resources would be less inclined to directly weigh the economic benefits of pursuing a graduate degree, and instead would be more influenced by the intrinsic expectations of pursuing that graduate degree within their individual field of study.\nAnother interesting component to the findings of this study relate to the varying preferences exhibited by education majors. At the point of graduate aspiration, education majors differed from business majors more than any other category. Education majors were more than two and a half times as likely to aspire to graduate school than their peers who majored in business; the next highest differential was for mathematics and life/physical science majors.\nWhile there is a clear and significant difference between education and business majors at the point of graduate school aspiration, there was no significant difference found at the point of either graduate school application or graduate school enrollment. It is possible that this finding shows a limitation of the data in that the survey was conducted only one year after the completion of the baccalaureate degree; perhaps many of those education majors who aspire to graduate school planned on working for a year or more prior to entering graduate school.\nThe findings related to student major present a number of interesting implications for the operationalization of human capital theory. The conceptual model posited that the undergraduate major would serve as a proxy for expected earnings and that, attendant to human capital theory, those individuals with higher expected foregone wages would be less likely to pursue graduate education. Our findings indicate, however, that undergraduate major functions more as a demand for graduate education and potentially supports the human capital alternative of credentialism theory (Bills, 2003) . Given the general nature of the focus of our research and the limitations of the dataset, we were unable to explore the relationship between undergraduate major, expected earnings, and graduate school in greater detail.\nThe total amount of debt that a student accumulated while completing their baccalaureate degree was not a statistically significant predictor of graduate school aspiration, application, or enrollment. These results align with the work of Weiler (1991) and Schapiro, O'Malley, and Litten (1991) , who found no association between indebtedness and graduate education. The finding contradicts, however, the findings of Heller (2001 ), Fox (1992 ), and Millett (2003 , who concluded that a negative association exists between debt and graduate education, as well as the findings of Ekstrom, Goertz, Pollack, and Rock (1991) , who discovered a positive association between debt and graduate school. It is somewhat surprising that we found no association between indebtedness and graduate school choice processes, for two primary reasons. First, we anticipated that the findings of this study would more closely track the results obtained by Heller (2001) and Millett (2003) , as their studies drew from the previous iteration (1993) of the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study.\nThese findings are also surprising given the substantive policy changes enacted in the 1992 Higher Education Act Reauthorization process. Those policy changes included a transition from grants to loans as the primary mechanism for funding undergraduate degrees and a substantial increase in the amounts of loans that a student could borrow in a given year or over the course of their baccalaureate degree. We theorized that those changes would result in increased levels of accumulated undergraduate student indebtedness and that the increased levels of debt would act as a counteragent to higher educational aspiration via the human capital component of the conceptual model.\nAlthough our results find no association between undergraduate debt and the graduate school choice process, our analyses are unable to explore the factors that undergird that relationship. Questions related to an individual's aversion to loans and how that manifests an interest in graduate school are of practical and theoretical interest and point towards areas of future research. While the finding that accumulated undergraduate indebtedness does not influence graduate school choice processes is surprising, it is not without certain logical explanations. It is plausible that the policy changes included in the 1992 Higher Education Act, which authorized increased levels of undergraduate indebtedness, did not, in fact, result in students taking on unmanageable loan levels. It is also possible that states and institutions of higher education increased their own contributions to financial aid programs that mitigated the need for indebtedness. The ability to defer undergraduate loan repayments while enrolled in graduate school might also act as a financial incentive for certain students to pursue graduate education. By doing so, the individual would lessen their immediate opportunity cost of enrolling, which aligns with the theory of human capital investments."}, {"section_title": "Habitus, Cultural Capital, and Social Capital", "text": "The conceptual model employed in this paper was adapted from the work of Perna (2006) in her analysis of undergraduate college choice. As such, we theorized that a student would leverage his or her cultural capital and social capital, consistent with his or her situated habitus, in the graduate school choice process. A number of indirect approximations of cultural capital and social capital were included in the analyses, in addition to the demographic characteristics of race, ethnicity, and gender.\nRace/ethnicity and gender have been commonly explored components of graduate school choice research (Perna, 2004) . We found was no statistically significant difference between males and females at any of the three phases of the graduate school choice process, differing from the findings of Millett (2003) , Perna (2004 ), Weiler (1991 ), Zhang (2005 . The initial review of descriptive statistics showed that female students comprised a larger portion of the sample than males (58% to 42%). The female share of the percentage of individuals aspiring for, applying to, and enrolling in graduate school were also higher than males at each step in the process, although the gap narrowed at each subsequent level (i.e., enrollment gap was narrower than application, which was narrower than aspiration). The multilevel analysis, however, found no statistical difference between males and females when controlling for all other variables included in the model. This finding implies that perhaps the educational attainment gap between men and women has finally begun to close at the graduate level. This would not be entirely surprising; females have made a number of advancements in baccalaureate enrollment and attainment in recent years, and graduate education was one of the last areas where parity had not yet been achieved (Perna, 2004) .\nAdditionally, African-American students were significantly more likely to aspire to, apply for, and enroll in graduate school than their white peers. This aligns with the findings of Millett (2003) and Perna (2004) but differs from Zhang (2005) . Hispanic/Latino students were not statistically different from white students when comparing actual graduate school enrollments, but were more likely to both aspire to and apply for graduate school. These findings differ from the previous work of Millett (2003) and Zhang (2005) but align with the findings of Perna (2004) .\nWe extend this work by providing an analysis of how those differences change between the first phase of the graduate school choice process, aspiration, and the last phase, enrollment. Again, we draw comparisons between the models with caution, but it is useful to examine differences that appear. While the findings that African-American students outpace their white peers in aspiring to, applying for, and enrolling in graduate school is certainly positive, there are two confounding issues that warrant consideration. First, the change in magnitude of the difference between African-American and white students between graduate school aspiration and enrollment is troubling. While this difference could be the result of statistical differences in the samples, it is also possible that these results point to an elevated level of graduate school aspiration among African-American students that is not being converted into actual graduate enrollments. Second, these findings highlight an issue that Perna (2004) noted in her previous research on graduate school enrollment. The multilevel models specifically account for and hold all other variables in the model constant. While this is beneficial when examining the discreet effect of race/ethnicity on graduate school choice processes, it is problematic in that few African-American students possess characteristics comparable to white students included in the model (e.g., parents' education attainment, dependency status, and income).\nThis concern is borne out in the analysis of graduate school choice that we conducted, which included only race as an independent variable. The difference between African-American and white students' proclivity for graduate school was smaller in the race-only models, indicating that controlling for those other individual and institutional variables comprises a substantial portion of the differences observed. Even more troubling is that in the race-only model, African-American students showed no significant difference from their white peers concerning actual enrollment in graduate school.\nThe statistically significant difference between Hispanic/Latino students and white students contradicts the findings of Millett (2003) but confirms the results presented by Perna (2004) . Hispanic/Latino students seem to mirror the same trends exhibited by their African-American peers, but in a less pronounced way. Whereas African-American students differed from the reference group of white at every step of the graduate pipeline, Hispanic/ Latino students differed only at the points of graduate school aspiration and graduate school application. This appears to be very similar to the phenomenon found within the context of African-American versus white students. The same limitations that apply to African-American students regarding the implications of these findings also apply to Hispanic/Latino students.\nThe theoretical concept of the habitus posits that a student carries an internalized set of beliefs, assumptions, and perceptions about the world and how he or she fits into that world. As in any quantitative study that uses secondary survey data, we are limited in the explicit assessments that we are able to make of our findings relative to this theoretical concept. There is, however, a point that merits additional discussion. Our findings indicate that within the construct of the graduate school choice process, when accounting for all other variables in the model, individuals from non-majority populations are not inherently disadvantaged. The analytical models employed specify that other characteristics, such as the type of undergraduate institution attended and the undergraduate major, have a larger impact on the graduate school choice process. These findings indicate that students influence, enhance, and add to their habitus while enrolled in college as undergraduates. As such, this implies that examination of the habitus on the graduate school choice process is more complex than initially theorized, and that additional research should explore the factors influencing the choice of undergraduate institution and undergraduate major.\nWhile the concepts of cultural capital and social capital are distinct from the concept of habitus, our model theorizes a tightly intertwined relationship between the three. The findings of this study related to the impact of cultural capital and social capital on the of graduate school choice process are two-fold. First, we found significantly fewer cultural and social capital variables to influence the graduate school choice process than Perna (2004) . Given that we employed a more methodologically advanced approach, the findings of this study call into question the appropriateness of using indirect measures of cultural and social capital. Second, while inclusion of the block of cultural capital and social capital variables did improve the overall efficacy of the model, the lack of significance on the majority of the individual independent variables points to the need for more explicit and direct measures of cultural and social capital in future studies. Perna (2004) previously acknowledged this, and the findings of this study reiterate that point in an even clearer light.\nOur conceptual model posited that the student's habitus was situated within the context of the undergraduate institution he or she attended. Perna (2004) previously found that the type of undergraduate institution attended influenced the graduate school choice process, and could be considered a strong proxy for social capital. Our findings support this concept, noting that individuals who attended specialized institutions and baccalaureate colleges were less likely to apply for and enroll in graduate school than their peers who graduated from a doctoral/research university. However, we did not find other characteristics of the undergraduate institution to significantly influence any other phase of the graduate school choice process."}, {"section_title": "implications For Future research, policy, and practice", "text": "This study makes important contributions to the theoretical literature that explores graduate school choice processes and provides a number of avenues for future research. We demonstrate that Perna's (2004) integrated undergraduate college choice conceptual model can be adapted and applied to graduate school choice research. We demonstrate that variables associated with students are more powerful in shaping graduate school choice decisions than characteristics of the undergraduate institution they attended. Future research should attempt to locate and model additional characteristics of the undergraduate institution to determine if they influence the graduate school choice process.\nWe considered only the first two-levels (Habitus and Undergraduate Institution Context) of the conceptual model in this study and collapsed all potential graduate school options into a single measure. Future studies might build upon this work and incorporate the third and fourth levels of the model into the study, which include characteristics of the institution and graduate program in which the student decides to enroll and the broad social, economic, and policy context.\nWhile we did not find accumulated undergraduate indebtedness to significantly influence any of the three phases of the graduate school choice process, future research should continue to explore this concept. It is possible that the rapid increases in tuition and fees seen since 2000 have resulted in increased indebtedness levels that would affect graduate school choice. We also collapsed all forms of student indebtedness into a single metric; future research should explore whether differing effects exist by loan type (e.g., subsidized, unsubsidized, private). Additional qualitative research that deeply explores the relationship between debt, loan aversion, and graduate school choice would help provide nuance to this complex topic. The conflicting findings of multiple quantitative analyses point towards the need for a qualitative approach.\nAnother implication for theory and future research concerns the concepts of habitus, cultural capital, and social capital. Scholars have begun exploring ways to build upon the traditional approach of modeling educational choice decisions via a human capital theory approach. The findings of this study imply that the undergraduate experience has the potential to affect a student's habitus. This includes characteristics of the institution attended as well as the student's undergraduate major. Our findings also echo those of Perna (2004) in that inclusion of indirect measures of cultural capital and social capital variables improved the overall efficacy of the models tested. We found, however, that the majority of the proxies tested did not significantly influence the three phases of graduate school choice.\nThis finding points towards the continued explicit inclusion of habitus, cultural capital and social capital concepts within graduate school choice frameworks. Unfortunately, many of the nationally representative datasets fail to include direct and appropriate measures of habitus, cultural capital, and social capital, leaving the researcher to rely on approximations and indirect measures. Cultural capital and social capital are largely defined as being accumulated by the student prior to his or her graduation from high school, but there are areas in which future surveys could focus on the collegiate experience. In college, cultural capital could be measured by exposure to artistic and cultural events. Social capital measures could focus on the extent to which the undergraduate institution provided information about graduate school opportunities, allowed for faculty/student interactions, and advanced undergraduate research projects. The inclusion of direct measures of cultural capital and social capital would allow for a more focused analysis of the efficacy of those models.\nWe modeled dependency and income as a measure of cultural capital in our analysis. These dependent students are far more reliant on their families for support, and their graduate school choice decisions are therefore more contingent upon family circumstances. In future studies that include a student follow-up more than one year beyond the point the student receives the baccalaureate degree, it would make more sense to separate out dependency and income and include income as a component of the human capital interaction. At that point, the majority of the students in the sample should have achieved independent status, and their own personal earnings would act as an opportunity cost limitation in the human capital component of the model.\nOur findings also point to several implications and recommendations for policy and practice. First, it is important to note that the undergraduate major a student pursues significantly influences the decision to pursue graduate education. Students who major in a \"pure\" field (e.g., mathematical sciences) are more likely to pursue a graduate degree than those who major in an \"applied\" field (e.g., business). Academic advising programs should note these inherent differences when explaining post-graduation options and the benefits of pursuing a graduate education, as they relate to students' specific major choices.\nMoreover, while this study revealed that the student background characteristics of the type of high school attended and parental income do not significantly influence graduate school choice, other individual-level variables are still important. First generation college students are less likely to aspire to, apply for, and enroll in graduate school than their peers. Colleges and universities should seek to identify these students as early as possible in their undergraduate career and provide them with information and counseling about graduate school.\nWhile this study found African-American and Hispanic/Latino students to be more likely than their white peers to pursue a graduate education, it highlights additional work needed in improving undergraduate attainment rates for those historically underrepresented populations. As the potential pool of graduate enrollees is comprised primarily of white students, additional programs and policies should focus on equalizing access to and completion of the baccalaureate degree for underrepresented populations.\nThe findings of this study demonstrate that many underrepresented minority students who successfully complete a baccalaureate program aspire to a graduate education. This study highlights the fact that only a relatively small number of underrepresented students actually reach that point, however, by analyzing the impact of race along the process of graduate school aspiration, application, and enrollment. As such, colleges and universities should seek out African-American and Hispanic/Latino students early in their undergraduate tenure and provide focused academic advising on the decision of whether to pursue a graduate degree."}, {"section_title": "conclusions", "text": "The purpose of this study was to explore the effect that individual and institutional factors have on the graduate school choice process. We advanced a conceptual model that explicitly constructed the process as a nested progression, with students situated within undergraduate institutions. The model posits that the graduate school choice process is comprised of three discreet phases, with students first developing an aspiration for graduate education, then submitting an application, and ultimately enrolling in a graduate program. This study has advanced the body of knowledge related to the graduate school choice process in a number of ways. The use of data that are more recent and a more sophisticated methodological approach refined the existing body of knowledge with respect to the factors that influence graduate school aspiration, application, and enrollment. Future research should extend this work by further honing the methodological approach and by identifying more recent and/or comprehensive sources of data. As post-undergraduate opportunity continues to shift in our changing economic climate, the role of graduate education will become more important as students attempt to navigate their options after college. Understanding which individual student level and undergraduate institution level factors influence the decision to pursue graduate education can help improve both graduate school program efficiency and overall educational equity."}]
