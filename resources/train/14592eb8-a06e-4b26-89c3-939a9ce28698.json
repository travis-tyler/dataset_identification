[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "17 18"}, {"section_title": "Introduction 32 33", "text": "The Philippine archipelago, with its fast-growing population clustered along the coastline, is 34 one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change. It is especially prone to the 35 devastating effects of tropical cyclones (Cinco et al., 2014) . Thus, it is considered a hotspot 36 region for hydrometeorological disasters (Cruz et The Philippines were struck by several devastating TCs in recent years (Table 1) . Typhoon 47 64 A few studies have demonstrated the potential to investigate tropical cyclones using stable 65 water isotopes (e.g. Good et al., 2014; Lawrence et al., 2002; Munksgaard et al., 2015) . Stable 66 water isotopes (\u03b4 2 H and \u03b4 18 O) serve as dynamic tracers of hydrological processes and can 67 provide insights into the water and energy budgets of TCs (Good et al., 2014; Lawrence and 68 Gedzelman, 1996) . For regions with general TC occurrence, significantly lower \u03b4 2 H and \u03b4 18 O 69 are associated with TC rainfall due to strong fractionation processes, compared to other 70 tropical rain events (Lawrence, 1998; Lawrence and Gedzelman, 1996) . Furthermore, \u03b4 2 H and 71 \u03b4 18 O have been used successfully to interpret TC history from paleoarchives, such as tree rings 72 and speleothems. For instance, tree-ring cellulose isotope proxies have recorded the recent 73 220 years of cyclones in the southeastern USA (Miller et al., 2006) ; similarly, high-resolution 74 isotopic analysis of tree-rings from the eastern US revealed the occurrence of hurricanes in 75 2004 (Li et al., 2011) ; a 23-year stalagmite record from Central America was used to 76 reconstruct past TC activity (Frappier et al., 2007) , and isotope signals from a 800-year 77 stalagmite record were used to reconstruct past TC frequencies in northeastern Australia 78 (Nott et al., 2007) . Interpretation of TC history from paleoarchives is based on the fact that 79\nTCs leave distinct isotopic signatures on precipitation, possibly providing information on TC's 80 evolution and structure (Lawrence et al., 2002) . 81"}, {"section_title": "82", "text": "The depletion in isotopes is attributed to the high condensation levels, strong isotopic 83 exchanges between inflowing water vapour and falling raindrops in cyclonic rainfall bands, 84 resulting in a temporal decrease of isotopic values throughout a rain event (i.e. amount effect) 85 (Lawrence, 1998; Lawrence and Gedzelman, 1996) . Isotopic depletion is further enhanced by 86 TC's thick, deep clouds, relatively large storm size and longevity (Lawrence, 1998) . 87 Furthermore, while isotopic depletion increases inwards towards the eye wall of the storm 88 (Lawrence and Gedzelman, 1996) global TC best-track data, and is a joint effort of various regional meteorological institutions 147 and centers that are part of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).

Such datasets are beneficial as they provide quasi-global grid-based 161 rainfall estimates for land and the oceans ( shifted to -13.84 \u2030, while the typhoon's track was the closest to our sampling site and rainfall 219 amount was high. As Rammasun moved away, precipitation isotopes became more positive, 220 and rainfall amount decreased. The characteristic isotopic evolution related to Rammasun's 221 distance and rainfall intensities as a function of time can be seen in Fig. 5a , where the different 222 radii indicate the distance to the sampling site, and the strong isotopic depletion observed on 16 July is also evident. As Rammasun with its storm center tracked towards the northwest 224 and away from Metropolitan Manila, our precipitation samples were relatively isotopically 225 enriched for the following two days. fractionation. This is particularly pronounced in intense, large-scale TCs (Lawrence, 1998; 250 Lawrence and Gedzelman, 1996) . In the previous section, we have presented our findings of 251 precipitation isotope ratios associated with typhoon activities affecting Metropolitan Manila 252 during the study period of March 2014 to October 2015. Based on our time series, we 253 therefore argue that for the Philippines, the lowest measured isotope value likely indicates 254 https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2019-352 Preprint.

Additionally, the 306 PAGASA rain gauge data indicates that rainfall amounts are very low during days with such 307 very enriched isotope samples, such as 0.3 mm/day for the highest recorded sample of 4 \u2030 308 on 9 April 2014. Interestingly, TCs at our site were found to be related with low isotope values 309 together with high rainfall amounts (Fig. 2) , while the majority of other low isotopic values 310 unassociated with TCs were characterized by on average lesser rainfall amounts. This possibly 311 indicates that TCs in the Philippines, besides using for instance modern-day satellite or radar 312 data, can be detected using these two parameters, i.e. strong isotopic depletion coupled with 313 high rainfall amounts. 314"}, {"section_title": "315", "text": "The aforementioned local convective precipitation events have the potential to induce a 316 signal of very negative \u03b4 18 O values which are not related to TC activities. We therefore label 317 such a signal as a \"false non-TC signal\", as it is induced by non-TC rainfall. This results in the fact that TCs occurring during our study period do not entirely cluster along the lowest range 319 of isotope values as seen in figure Fig. 2 . Nevertheless, Typhoon Rammasun caused a clear 320 drop in isotopes and stands out in the dataset. This might be the case because Rammasun's 321 track and heavy rainfall comes in closest proximity (50 km) to the sampling site. Other TCs 322 occurring within the 500 km radius did not lead to such a clear negative isotopic signature, 323 likely because these typhoons did not pass the sampling site at all or heavy rainfall occurred 324 elsewhere within the TC rainfall system (see S 2 for their tracks and accumulated rainfall Our observations provide details on spatial distance from collection site towards TCs' centers, 340 as our findings indicate that the distance from the storm center to the sampling site impacts 341 isotopic value. The TCs' distance of up to 500 km to sampling site and the precipitation isotope 342 value (r=0.55, n= 16, p-value= <0.0001, 99% confidence level) are correlated. This relationship 343 weakens with an increase in the distance from the sampling site: a distance of 500 to 1000 344 km yields an r of 0.2 (n=19, p-value= 0.019), the distance of 1000 to 1500 km yields an r of 345 0.18 (n=24, p-value= 0.087), while a 1500 to 2000 km distance results in an r of 0.1 (n=21, p-346 value= 0.65). This suggests that a TC more than 500 km away from the sampling site has no 347 influence on precipitation isotopes (Munksgaard et al., 2015) . Thus, the closer the TC is to the 348 sampling site, the more negative the isotope signal and the larger the \u03b4-change. This 349 relationship might provide information on storm structure and intensity, as the intensity increases with proximity of the TC to the sampling location. We thus confirm that the isotope 351 value at our location is a function of the closest approach of the storm's center to the 352 sampling site (Lawrence and Gedzelman, 1996) . occurs within the 500 km radius. However, two relatively negative outliers are located within 359 a 1000 to 1500 km radius in the northwest quadrant. These two samples were taken during 360 the passage of tropical storm Kujira on 22 nd and 23 rd of June 2015 (Fig. 2) , which was more 361 than 1000 km away from Metropolitan Manila travelling east along the coast of Vietnam as 362 seen with IBTrACKS data. We investigated these two samples with IMERG satellite 363 precipitation data and identified them as a part of a mesoscale system, with strong convective 364 cells delivering intense rainfall, leading to distinct isotopic depletion and inducing a \"false 365 non-TC signal\" of very negative rainfall unassociated with TC activity. 366 367"}, {"section_title": "Cyclone track's rainfall intensity 368", "text": "369 IMERG satellite precipitation data also identify that the highest rainfall intensities occur at the 370 left side of the TC track for all the TC within the 500 km radius, except for Hagupit and 371\nMekkhala, which are more complex cases (Fig. 3a, b, supplementary S 2) . This is in contrast 372 to the results from Villarini et al. (2011) , stating that the largest rainfall accumulation appears 373 on the right side of the hurricane tracks. They also noted that large rainfall amounts occur far 374 away from the storm's track, which we can confirm and quantify with our observations. The highest isotope values in the inner eye wall, i.e. in close proximity to the storm's center. We could not investigate this further as no TC passed by our site in a distance of about 20 km, 383 which is the size of a typical typhoon's eye (Weatherford and Gray, 1988) . 384 could also be improved, which is especially relevant for decision makers dealing with TC 406 related impacts and damages. Our in-situ isotope measurements provide baseline data input 407 in an understudied tropical region, providing isotopic data of TC occurrence and quantifying 408 the isotopic depletion associated with TC activity. Further, our 19-month dataset suggests 409 that the lowest measured isotope value at the Philippines study site is associated with TC 410 activity, resulting in the distinct negative isotopic shift in the time series (Fig. 2) . As rain out 411 history, topography, distance of track or rainfall unassociated with TCs can induce a weak or 412 \"false non-TC signal\", it is important to choose stalagmites or trees as archives based on their 413 location, ideally covering a spatial gradient thus capturing a TC in its full size. As presented with our dataset, a strong, high-energy TC with a track directly approaching and 418 hitting the sampling site leads to a clear isotopic signal in a time series in the Philippines. If 419 the TC is further away, such as more than 500 km from the site, or heavy TC rainfall occurred 420 elsewhere prior of making landfall, the signal is not as clear and might average out between 421 other rainfall events. Other strong convective rainfall events unassociated with TCs may result 422 in similarly low isotope values, and we label these as a weak or \"false non-TC signal\". 423 Therefore, our data suggests that distance of TC to the sampling site is a key factor in 424 controlling the isotope signal and that such a spatial component needs to be considered when 425 interpreting the isotope signal. However, a longer time series isotope record would help to 426 better constrain controlling factors, such as the influence of topography on high-energy TCs. 427\nTo what extent mountain ranges and low elevation coastal areas shape the TC induced 428 isotope signal needs further investigation. Based on our findings we conclude that the 429 location of sample collection needs to be chosen strategically. Ideally, several rainwater 430 collection stations should be operated, covering a wide geographical range such as stretching 431 from northern Luzon to its south. If such a spatial gradient was covered, a TC would likely be 432 captured in its full size. Consequently, we aim to expand our time series spatially and 433 temporally. Additionally, we found that the degree of convection can induce a \"false non-TC signal\" of 458 very low isotope values not associated with TC activity. Other factors which limit the strength 459 and clarity of the isotope signal are distance of TC towards the sampling side, rain out history, 460 TC track and topography. Our dataset is the first of such record in the Philippines and provides 461 much needed data in scarcely sampled Southeast Asia. It can be used as a baseline in 462 paleoclimate studies reconstructing past TC history, in conjunction with tree ring and 463 speleothem datasets, as our data suggest that for Metropolitan Manila the lowest measured 464 isotope value is caused by typhoon activity. A higher precipitation sampling frequency on sub-465 daily levels at several locations would yield more detailed constraints on TC parameters such 466 as storm structure, which we aim to realize in the future.
