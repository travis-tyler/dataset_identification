[{"section_title": "", "text": "This study provides data to help states in the region tailor initiatives to the needs of beginning teachers. It responds to a request expressed by stakeholders in four of the region's states and the New England Collaborative for Educator Effectiveness (formed by six New England states to address common issues related to educator evaluation) to better understand the characteristics and preparation of beginning teachers in the region and to have information on how beginning teachers are supported. This study also contributes to the literature on teacher preparation, working conditions, and support by providing an overview of the characteristics and experiences of beginning teachers in the Northeast Region and nationally. The following are key findings of the study: On demographic characteristics: \u2022 In 2007/08, there were an estimated 90,370 beginning teachers in the Northeast Region states, ranging from 1,476 in Vermont to 52,409 in New York, and 832,264 nationally. \u2022 The majority of beginning teachers regionally and nationally were female and White: regionally, 73.7 percent were female and 91.0 percent were White; nationally, 75.7 percent were female and 89.4 percent were White. On preparation and certification characteristics: \u2022 Almost all beginning teachers had a bachelor's degree (99.2 percent regionally and 98.9 percent and nationally). Most beginning teachers had a degree from a department, school, or college of education (59.1 percent regionally and 64.7 percent nationally). \u2022 Regionally, about a fifth (22.5 percent) of beginning teachers had an undergraduate major in elementary or secondary education, the most common single field or area, compared with 31.2 percent nationally. \u2022 Regionally, a majority of beginning teachers had a master's degree (58.2 percent), with most (88.6 percent) of these awarded by a department, school, or college of education. Nationally, 28.9 percent of beginning teachers had a master's degree, with 85.4 percent of these from a department, school, or college of education. \u2022 Almost all beginning teachers regionally had taken courses focused on teaching methods or strategies (94.3 percent), compared with 87.3 percent nationally. \u2022 The most common length of teaching practice was 12 weeks or more: 63.1 percent regionally and 61.2 percent nationally. \u2022 Most beginning teachers had a regular type of teaching certificate as opposed to an alternate or emergency certification (63.1 percent regionally and 69.9 percent nationally). \u2022 About a quarter of beginning teachers entered teaching through an alternative certification program (23.0 percent regionally and 25.6 percent nationally). \u2022 Elementary or secondary education was the most common area of primary certification (34.0 percent regionally and 43.6 percent nationally), and early childhood to grade 5 was the most common grade range covered by the primary certification (25.4 percent regionally and 28.5 percent nationally). \u2022 Most beginning teachers were considered \"highly qualified\" in their state (82.7 percent regionally and 82.3 percent nationally). On induction and supports: \u2022 Most beginning public school teachers reported having participated in an induction program of some sort (72.8 percent regionally and 73.5 percent nationally). \u2022 Regionally, the most common support received during the first year of teaching was ongoing guidance and feedback from a mentor or master teacher (82.5 percent), and the least common was reduced teaching schedule or number of preparations (13.6 percent). Nationally, the most common support received was regular communication with the principal or another administrator (80.0 percent), and the least common was reduced teaching schedule or reduced number of preparations (11.9 percent). \u2022 A majority of beginning teachers reported feeling well or very well prepared in the first year of teaching to handle a range of classroom management or discipline situations (54.7 percent regionally and 59.3 percent nationally), to use a variety  This study provides a descriptive look at the basic demographic, preparation, and certification characteristics of beginning teachers in the Northeast and Islands Region states (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont 1 ), as well as regionally and nationally, using data from the 2007/08 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS). It also looks at their professional support and sense of preparedness for teaching and at characteristics of their classrooms and schools. Beginning teachers are defined as teachers who reported having five or fewer years of teaching experience at the time of the survey (meaning that they started teaching during or after the 2003/04 school year). The report focuses on variables related to teachers' preparation and workplace supports that research suggests are associated with their perceptions of preparedness, effectiveness, and retention. This is the first analysis of SASS data to look specifically at beginning teachers' characteristics and experiences in the Northeast Region. However, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) has produced national studies of the characteristics, education, and certification backgrounds of secondary teachers (Coopersmith 2009;Morton et al. 2008). More recently, a Regional Educational Laboratory Northwest study looked at the preparation and support of new teachers in the Northwest Region and nationally using 2003/04 SASS data (Burke 2010). Studies have yielded mixed findings on support to beginning teachers; their education, preparation, and certification; their participation in supports and sense of preparedness for teaching; and characteristics of their classrooms and schools (see appendix A for a review of related literature). Despite the mixed findings, the study team was able to identify several factors that the literature finds to be associated with teachers' sense of preparedness for teaching, their demonstrated effectiveness as measured by student achievement, and their plans to remain in the profession. This study will inform regional stakeholders, including state and local education agency officials and the New England Collaborative for Educator Effectiveness (NECEE) by providing descriptive data on the demographic characteristics and preparation of beginning teachers, the schools where they work, and the induction and support opportunities available to them. This study contributes to the literature on teacher preparation, working conditions, and support by providing an overview of the characteristics and experiences of beginning teachers in the Northeast Region states and nationally. This study responds to a request from regional stakeholders, including state and local education agency staff and representatives of the NECEE, who are interested in knowing more about the characteristics of the beginning teacher workforce in their states. In considering how best to support the development of beginning teachers, how to evaluate their effectiveness, and how to retain effective teachers, state education agencies in the Northeast Region require accurate data. They would like to better understand how teachers in their states are prepared and to learn more about their early teaching experiences. They also want to know whether beginning teachers are more likely to work in schools that make or fail to make adequate yearly progress. Several research questions guided this study: \u2022 What are the demographic characteristics of beginning public school teachers in the Northeast Region states and nationally? \u2022 What are the preparation and certification characteristics reported by beginning public school teachers in the Northeast Region states and nationally? \u2022 What induction and supports do beginning public school teachers report receiving in the Northeast Region states and nationally? \u2022 What are the characteristics of the students and classes taught by beginning public school teachers in the Northeast Region states and nationally? \u2022 What percentage of beginning public school teachers in the Northeast Region states and nationally work in schools that made and did not make adequate yearly progress? To answer these questions, this study used data from the 2007/08 SASS, a set of surveys that can be linked by school, to identify a set of variables for examination (table 1; see box 1 and appendix B for details). \u2022 Sex Whether female. \u2022 ethnicity Whether of hispanic origin. \u2022 race only the percentage of teachers who were White is reported, because the estimates of the percentages of teachers in all other racial/ethnic groups for the states in the region did not meet national center for education Statistics standard for reporting. \u2022 age at time of survey completion.

The least commonly reported support, both regionally (13.6 percent) and nationally (11.9 percent), was having a reduced teaching schedule or number of preparations. There are several statistically significant differences between state estimates and national estimates for particular supports, but none for extra classroom assistance, regular supportive communication with principal or other administrators, or ongoing guidance or feedback from a mentor or master teacher. Sense of preparedness. The task for which most teachers reported being well or very well prepared regionally (88.1 percent) and nationally (82.8 percent) was teaching in their assigned subject matter (table 19). Being well or very well prepared to use a variety of instructional methods was the second most highly rated task, at 73.2 percent of beginning teachers regionally and 71.3 percent nationally. The task with the lowest percentage of beginning teachers reporting being well or very well prepared was handling a range of classroom management or discipline situations, at 54.7 percent regionally and 59.3 percent nationally. Several state estimates were statistically different from the national estimates. A statistically higher percentage of beginning teachers in Connecticut reported being well or very well prepared to use a  variety of instructional methods, teach assigned subject matter, use computers in instruction, assess students, and select and adapt curriculum and instructional materials. A statistically higher percentage of beginning teachers in Rhode Island reported being well or very well prepared to teach assigned subject matter and assess students. A statistically lower percentage of beginning teachers in New Hampshire reported being well or very well prepared to use computers in classroom instruction. Characteristics of the students and classes taught by beginning public school teachers Class size. Beginning teachers who taught the same group of students all or most of the day in multiple subjects or who worked with one or more teachers in the same class at the same time and who were jointly responsible for teaching the same group of students all or most of the day taught an average of 19 students regionally and 20.9 students nationally (table 20). The estimates for Maine (16.4) and Vermont (16.4) are statistically lower than the national estimate. For beginning teachers who taught \"a small number\" of students in specific skills or who addressed students' specific needs, either inside or outside their regular classrooms (commonly called pull-out and push-in classes), the reported average nationally was 10.1 students taught at any one time. The estimates for Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont are statistically lower than the national estimate. Number of classes taught. The average number of separate classes taught by beginning teachers who instructed several classes of different students most or all of the day in one or more subjects or elementary school teachers who taught one subject to different classes of students was similar regionally (5.7 percent) and nationally (5.6 percent; see table 20). 2 The estimate for Vermont (4.8) is statistically lower than the national estimate.

The SASS sample is designed to be representative of all teachers, not necessarily of particular subgroups. It is possible that the subsample of beginning teachers surveyed was not representative of the population of beginning teachers. The group of beginning teachers is small as a percentage of each state's sample of teachers, ranging from 15 percent to 23 percent (unweighted sample). In many cases, state-level estimates have large standard errors that make the estimates unreliable. In addition, some other estimates should be interpreted with caution, as noted in the text and tables. A second limitation relates to the variable used to identify beginning teachers. Teachers were asked, \"Was your FIRST year of teaching before the 2003/04 school year?\" Teachers might define their first year of teaching differently. For example, one teacher might include student teaching time and another might not. This study defines beginning teachers as teachers who reported that they were in their fifth year or less of teaching at the time of data collection. ). This study focuses on beginning teachers because research suggests that, during the first three years of teaching, teachers improve their ability to affect student achievement (Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain 2004). However, 40-50 percent of beginning teachers leave the profession within five years (Ingersoll and Smith 2003), and most teacher turnover occurs at the beginning of careers and at retirement (Guarino, Santiba\u00f1ez, and Daley 2006). The current study defines beginning teachers as those reporting that they were in no later than their fifth year of teaching when data was collected. Using 2007/08 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) data, the study focuses on teacher education and preparation, professional support and teachers' sense of preparedness, and the characteristics of teachers' classrooms and schools. The literature suggests that these areas are associated with factors that state and local education agencies seek to foster in their beginning teachers, such as preparedness, effectiveness (as measured by student achievement), and retention. Beginning teachers' education, preparation, and certification The current study describes beginning teachers' formal education, preparation for teaching through coursework and fieldwork, and certification pathways. Research has examined whether these characteristics are related to student outcomes, with varying findings. Constantine et al. (2009) conducted a randomized controlled trial of teachers prepared through different certification routes, comparing alternatively certified teachers with traditionally certified teachers in the same schools. No statistical difference between these teachers' student achievement was found. Further, after controlling for other teacher characteristics, the study's nonexperimental analyses found no correlation between student achievement and the amount of teacher coursework in certain content areas (for example, math pedagogy), the amount of fieldwork, or having majored in education. However, Croninger et al. (2009), who focused on early childhood using hierarchical linear modeling and data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, reported that having teachers who took coursework in math and reading methods was positively associated with grade 1 student achievement. Wayne and Youngs (2003) conducted a systematic literature review and concluded that teachers with advanced degrees are positively associated with math achievement for high school students, but the research was inconclusive on the relationship between teachers with advanced degrees and literacy or science achievement. And Allen (2003) noted moderate support in the literature for the view that teachers with strong subject matter knowledge increase student achievement, as well as for consensus that teachers should practice teaching. The research was not definitive about the best way for teachers to acquire such field experience. Research has also examined whether beginning teachers' formal education, preparation, and characteristics of certification are related to teacher retention. Borman and Dowling (2008), in a meta-analysis of factors affecting teacher attrition, concluded that teachers with advanced degrees are more likely than teachers with other degrees to leave teaching than those without advanced degrees. The study found also that teachers with a traditional or regular teaching certificate could be less likely to leave teaching than those without a certificate. Borman and Dowling (2008) also asserted that teachers with degrees in math and science could be more likely to leave teaching. Similarly, using hierarchical linear modeling with the 1999/2000 SASS, Strunk and Robinson (2006) reported that teachers with specialized degrees, such as in foreign language, could be more likely than teachers with nonspecialized degrees to leave teaching. Findings are mixed on the relationship between teacher certification and student achievement and on the importance of traditional or alternative routes to certification. Some studies, such as Constantine et al. (2009) and Kane, Rockoff, and Staiger's (2008) regression analysis using panel data on New York City teachers and students, found little difference among the performance of certified, uncertified, and alternatively certified teachers. Darling-Hammond et al. (2005) used regression analysis with student and teacher data from Houston, Texas, to assert a positive association between certification and student achievement, regardless of the route to certification. Goe and Stickler's (2008) review of the research concluded that certification status appeared to matter more in math than in other subject areas (see also Wayne and Youngs 2003). Glazerman, Mayer, and Decker (2006), in a randomized study of one alternative teacher certification pathway (Teach For America), 3 concluded that teachers had a positive impact on math achievement but no significant impact on reading achievement) when compared with a control group of teachers. 4 Beginning teachers' participation in supports and their sense of preparation for teaching The current study also examines whether beginning teachers participated in supports, such as induction programs, and how they described their sense of preparation or readiness for teaching, including classroom management and instruction. Researchers have studied whether beginning teachers' participation in various school supports and their early sense of preparation are related to student outcomes and teacher retention. While beginning teachers can obtain support by participating in mentoring and induction programs, the research findings for the effectiveness of these programs are mixed. Smith and Ingersoll (2004), in a study of first-year teachers using the 1999/2000 SASS data, found that participation in mentoring and induction programs was associated with reduced turnover among beginning teachers. Fletcher, Strong, and Villar's (2008) regression analysis also reported positive relationships between mentoring programs and student achievement. Glazerman et al.'s (2010) analysis of a randomized experiment, however, concluded no impact of comprehensive induction programs 5 on achievement in the first two years of teaching but significant and positive impacts in the third year. That study also found that comprehensive induction programs did not affect new teachers' feelings of preparedness to instruct, work with students, or work with colleagues. Beginning teachers can also gain support through collaborative school structures, such as common planning time and professional development. Goddard, Goddard, and Tschannen-Moran (2007) surveyed elementary school students and teachers in a large Midwestern district, finding that teachers with opportunities to participate in well developed professional learning communities (see also Vescio et al. 2008) tend to be associated with gains in student achievement. Jackson and Bruegmann (2009) computed a value-added model using longitudinal data to determine that a teacher's students make larger achievement gains when the teacher works with peers who have higher mean value-added scores. Additionally, researchers have investigated professional development's effect on teachers' classroom practices and its relationship with student appendix a. reVieW of The liTeraTure achievement. Wallace (2009), using structural equation modeling, found that increased professional development was associated with positive reported classroom practices in reading and math. Yoon et al. (2007) identified a relationship between professional development and improved student achievement. Professional, collaborative support structures also might enhance teacher retention. Teachers who reported more positive administrative support, who participated in a school mentoring program, and who had more opportunities for teacher networks and collaboration tended to have lower rates of attrition (Borman and Dowling 2008). Previous preparation experiences and school supports could enhance beginning teachers' self-reported readiness to teach. Researchers have examined whether teachers feel prepared to teach under the heading \"teacher efficacy-the teacher's belief in his or her capability to organize and execute courses of action required to successfully accomplish a specific teaching task in a particular context\" (Tschannen-Moran, Hoy, and Hoy 1998, p. 233). Based on a longitudinal study of participants in a master's in education program (Hoy and Spero 2005) and a large survey of graduate school student teachers at three universities (Tschannen-Moran and Hoy 2007), teachers' efficacy beliefs tended to increase with experience and beginning teachers relied more on support from colleagues to develop feelings of self-efficacy. In a study of teachers in Canada using quantitative analysis of baseline and follow-up teacher surveys and student achievement, as well as qualitative case studies of schools, teachers with a higher sense of efficacy when involved in larger school improvement efforts were more likely to set instructional goals, persevere through challenges, and have classes with higher student achievement (Bruce et al. 2010)."}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of beginning teachers' classrooms and schools", "text": "Finally, the current study describes characteristics of beginning teachers' classrooms and schools, such as student achievement levels under the current accountability system established by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. Several researchers have examined how workplace conditions and school environments are related to teacher retention and sense of support. Ingersoll and Smith (2003), using the SASS and a survey examining teacher turnover, revealed that 29 percent of beginning teacher turnover was due to dissatisfaction in workplace conditions, such as feeling unable to handle student-related issues, lack of administrative support, and class size. Teacher turnover was higher in environments lacking resources and are those described as having poorer working conditions-typically, schools with higher proportions of racial/ethnic minority students and students from low-income households (Borman and Dowling 2008;Loeb, Darling-Hammond, and Luczak 2005;Strunk and Robinson 2006). Teachers working in suburban schools tended to have greater access to mentoring and induction supports than teachers working in rural or high-poverty, high racial/ethnic minority schools (Johnson et al. 2004;Wei et al. 2010). Lastly, schools defined as \"low-performing,\" that is, schools with lower average student achievement scores, also tended to have higher rates of teacher attrition and turnover (Borman and Dowling 2008;Clotfelter et al. 2004)."}, {"section_title": "22", "text": "The characTeriSTicS and experienceS of beginning TeacherS"}, {"section_title": "aPPeNdIx b daTa aNd MeThodology", "text": "This appendix describes the study's data source and methodology."}, {"section_title": "Data source", "text": "This study examines data from the 2007/08 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).

Imputation does not apply to questions that respondents were instructed to skip based on a previous response. The imputation process used by SASS is described as follows by NCES in a Methodology and Technical Notes document on the Restricted-Use data disk (U.S. Department of Education n.d. b): After the final edits were run, cases with \"not-answered\" values for items remained. Values were imputed using a two stage process. In the first stage, items were imputed with a valid response using data either from the sample frame, other items in the same SASS questionnaire, or another questionnaire associated with the same school or school district. In addition, data were ratio adjusted in some circumstances so that items were consistent with one another. In the second stage, donor-respondent methods, such as hot-deck imputation, were used. If no suitable donor case could be matched, the few remaining items were imputed with a mean or mode from groups of similar cases. After each stage of imputation, computer edits were run again to verify that the imputed data were consistent with the existing questionnaire data. If that was not the case, an imputed value was blanked out by one of these computer edits due to inconsistency with other data within the same questionnaire or because it was out of the range of acceptable values. In these situations, Census Bureau analysts looked at the items and tried to determine an appropriate value. Imputation flags, indicating which imputation method was used, were assigned to each imputed survey variable. For further information, see the section on data processing and imputation in the Documentation for the 2007-08 Schools andStaffing Survey (Tourkin et al. 2010, p. 7)."}, {"section_title": "aPPeNdIx d coMPaRISoN of begINNINg TeacheRS SaMPled IN The SchoolS aNd STaffINg SuRvey", "text": "The Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) Teacher Survey provides two ways to identify beginning teachers: a five-year criterion and a three-year criterion. This report defines beginning teachers as teachers who answered \"no\" to question number 36 on the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS): \"Was your FIRST year of teaching before the 2003/04 school year?\" A \"no\" response indicated that these teachers have five or fewer years of teaching experience. However, the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) is sampled to provide a nationally representative sample of beginning teachers using a new variable called NEWTCH for teachers \"who have three or fewer years of experience including fulland part-time teaching experience in public and private schools\" (Tourkin et al. 2010, p. T-9). The variable is coded as follows: if TOTEXPER le 3 then NEWTCH = 1; else NEWTCH = 2. The tables in this appendix show the differences between the samples for the two definitions.

In answering the SASS question on number of separate classes taught, teachers reported that they either instruct several classes of different students most or all of the day in one or more subjects or, as an elementary school teacher, taught only one subject to different classes of students. 3. Teach for America is an alternative pathway to certification that recruits recent college and university graduates. Teach for America teachers are not certified when they begin teaching. They instead participate in five weeks of summer training before entering the classroom. Most Teach for America teachers are concurrently enrolled in a degree or certification program, and 51 percent of the Teach for America teachers were certified when data were collected (Glazerman, Mayer, and Decker 2006). 4. Control group teachers included both certified and uncertified teachers, teachers with and without degrees in education, and teachers with varying amounts of preservice student teaching experience (Glazerman et al. 2006). 5. Comprehensive induction programs are \"intensive, structured, and sequentially delivered supports\" often \"delivered through experienced, trained full-time mentors and may also include a combination of school and district orientation sessions, special in-service training (professional development), classroom observations, and constructive feedback through formative assessment\" (Glazerman et al. 2010, p. xxiii). Glazerman et al. (2010) did not compare comprehensive induction programs to no induction program but to the typical program at the control schools. 6. For two states with the same estimates, one might be significantly different from the national estimate and the other might not, because each test is a pairwise comparison of the state and the national estimates, and each state sample size is different, as is the standard error for each state's estimate."}]
