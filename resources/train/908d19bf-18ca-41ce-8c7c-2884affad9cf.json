[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Human reliance on water has led to water issues globally. Although "}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Water is essential to human life; however, human activities have negatively impacted water resources (Oki & Kanae, 2006) . As the world population continues to grow, water demand has increased rapidly and led to global climate change (V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty, Green, Salisbury, & Lammers, 2000) . In addition, water issues, such as water pollution and contamination, water scarcity, degradation of water quality, waterlogging, and increased water salinity levels have been reported worldwide as a result of population growth, climate change, and the mismanagement of land use (Young, Dooge, & Rodda, 1994) . In order to improve the sustainability of water resources, extension professionals have made efforts towards solving water issues by developing educational programs to educate a wide range of audiences about water conservation technologies and practices (Bruening & Martin, 1992; McCann & Gold, 2012; Singletary & Daniels, 2004) . Researchers have suggested that the diversity of audiences, based on demographic In Florida, pressure is being placed on water resources by a growing population, prosperous tourism, and an active agricultural industry (Barnett, 2007; Marella, 2013) . Marella (2013) indicated the public supply in Florida accounted for 37% of freshwater withdraw, 52% of fresh groundwater use, and 13% of fresh surface water use. Florida residents consumed a high volume per capita water use and urbanization of Florida has led to increased water use for landscape irrigation (Haley, Dukes, & Miller, 2007; Marella, 2013) . However, many Florida residents are unaware of how the landscaping management practices they use can impact the environment (Israel & Knox, 2013) including the general water supply. Monaghan, Ott, Wilber, Gouldthorpe, and Racevskis (2013) identified this specific group of urban water users as high water users. High water users were found to be residents living in neighborhoods with a homeowners association (HOA), older in age, higher incomes and education levels than the general public (Monaghan et al., 2013) . Monaghan et al. (2013) investigated the users' water conservation behaviors associated with landscape irrigation and found they preferred to hire a contractor instead of managing their own yards and were less concerned about water conservation practices, which was similar to the finding of Israel and Knox's (2013) study.\nEfforts have been made by University of Florida Extension and lawmakers to develop educational programs, restrictions, and informational campaigns to engage the general public in proper water management practices and water conservation strategies (Greene, 2010; Lee, Tansel, & Balbin, 2013; University of Florida Extension, 2014) . However, while many Florida residents have engaged in water conservation behaviors and were interested in learning more about water issues (Roper & Lamm, 2014) , engagement in conservation efforts and an interest in learning about water conservation may not be exhibited by certain residents (Israel & Knox, 2013; Monaghan et al., 2013) . According to Israel and Knox (2013) and Monaghan et al. (2013) , high water users, such as HOA residents, may have their water management practices strongly influenced by HOA restrictions, which leads to less concern about water conservation. Therefore, this study sought to determine if high water users and the general public were different in their actual water use behaviors and their support of water conservation behaviors. By understanding the differences between high water users and the general public, the fifth priority of the National Research Agenda: \"efficient and effective agricultural education programs\" (Doerfert, 2011, p. 10) can be reached. As a result of this research, extension professionals will be better prepared to develop programs related to water conservation by targeting the proper audience leading to positive learning outcomes.\nand has been widely used in social marketing for behavior change (Andreasen, 2006; Kotler & Roberto, 1989) . Kotler and Roberto (1989) indicated shared characteristics within a group can be geographical characteristics (region, population density, climate), socio-demographic attributes (age, income, social class), psychological profiles (attitudes, personality traits, values), and behavioral characteristics (patterns of behavior or decision making types). By segmenting audiences, the homogeneous group can benefit the marketing process through a better understanding of the audience's needs, higher satisfaction that will increase the likelihood of audience's behavior continuum, and effective communication and distribution strategies (Andreasen, 2006; Kotler & Roberto, 1989) . Additionally, the resources and efforts put into a program can be organized more efficiently with audience segmentation by basing them on an audience's specific needs and interests (Andreasen, 2006) . Social marketing has been used in environmental and conservation efforts frequently (Shaw, 2010) , with audience segmentation being suggested by various researchers. Salmon, Brunson, and Kuhns (2006) investigated nonindustrial private forest owners to understand their education needs and indicated the studied forest owners could be segmented into three groups according to a prior evaluation survey measuring \"respondents' evaluations of the importance of various benefits of land-ownership\" (p. 421). Adhikarya (1994) suggested the use of audience segmentation in extension programming to better reach audience needs and provide proper information to the proper audiences. Brunson and Price (2009) conducted a study targeting small-acreage landowners and found that the landowners characterized differently based on demographic features, information-use patterns, and delivery preferences. This finding indicated that a proper use of audience segmentation can save money used for program materials while maintaining quality extension programming. Another study conducted by Tyson and Broderick (1999) examined woodland owners' intentions to practice estate conservation planning. The audience segmentation in this study was based on woodland owners' intentions, leading to the need for strategic program planning for campaign planning on estate conservation. Israel and Hague (2002) indicated the importance of using segmentation concepts for extension program recruitment. While Monaghan et al. (2013) studied how audience segmentation can be used for extension programming on water conservation behavior, the identified group, HOA residents, was indicated as an audience extension professionals should target specifically. However, extension professionals have limited resources and increased numbers of urban residents with specific needs; therefore the need to focus financial resources is more important than ever (Harder, Lamm, & Strong, 2009 ). To focus limited resources more efficiently, extension professionals needs to understand their audiences to improve program planning, particularly for services in urban areas where Extension typically lacks advocacy (Harder et al., 2009) . In order to assist extension professionals in optimizing educational programs related to water conservation targeting high water users, needs assessments are needed to identify the differences between this audience and the general population. Based on the previous literature, a conceptual model was designed (see Figure  1) . Based on previous research, high water users are supposed to have particular demographic characteristics, which impact their engagement, attitudes, and interests in water conservation behaviors (Monaghan et al., 2013) . By understanding high water users' reported engagement, attitudes, and interests in water conservation behaviors, extension professionals will be able to develop extension programming that best fits high water users' needs and interests. As a result, this new programming, based on the concept of audience segmentation, will be expected to have a higher potential for successfully convincing high water users to engage in water conservation behaviors."}, {"section_title": "Purpose and Objectives", "text": "The purpose of this study was to identify differences in levels of engagement in water conservation behaviors between the general public and high water users in Florida in order to further facilitate the development of extension programs targeting high water users' adoption of water conservation behaviors. The objectives were to compare:\n1. The water use behaviors the general public and high water users currently engage in; 2. The water conservation strategies the general public and high water users currently apply; 3. The water conservation behaviors the general public and high water users would like to engage in; and 4. The societal behaviors associated with water conservation the general public and high water users would like to engage in."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "This study was descriptive and comparative using online surveys to investigate the differences in water conservation behaviors between the general public and high water users in Florida. Two surveys were conducted in Florida using the same questionnaire, but different groups of respondents were reached: one for the general public and the other for high water users. The survey instrument was developed based on the 2012 RBC Canadian Water Attitudes Study (Patterson, 2012) . Respondents aged 18 years or older living in Florida were recruited for the surveys.\nThe respondents were asked questions regarding their water use behaviors, water conservation strategies they are currently engaged in, and the likelihood of engaging in the water conservation and societal behaviors associated with water conservation. Respondents' water use behaviors were measured using 7 statements on a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 = Never, 2 = Almost Never, Responses to the 7 items were averaged to create overall water use behavior index scores which were found reliable in both surveys (general public: \u03b1 = .79; high water users: \u03b1 = .75). As for measuring respondents' water conservation strategies they are currently engaged in, a three-point scale of -1 = No, 0 = Not Sure, 1 = Yes was used in five statements. The responses to the five items were averaged to create overall water conservation strategy index scores. Respondents' likelihood of engaging in the water conservation behaviors was measured by 12 statements using a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 = Very Unlikely, 2 = Unlikely, 3 = Undecided, 4 = Likely, 5 = Very Likely, while societal behaviors associated with water conservation were measured by eight statements using the same five-point Likert-type scale. Again, a Not applicable option was available in the water conservation and societal behaviors questions, and responses of Not applicable were treated as missing values. Responses to the 12 water conservation behavior items were averaged to create overall water conservation behavior index scores with reliability of \u03b1 = .80 in the general public survey and \u03b1 = .81 in the high water user survey and responses to the eight societal behavior items were averaged to create a societal behavior associated with water conservation index scores which were found reliable in both surveys (general public: \u03b1 = .85; high water users: \u03b1 = .87). Lastly, respondents were asked to answer several demographic questions including sex, race/ethnicity, age, zip code (later converted to rural-urban continuum codes), annual household income, educational level, political beliefs, and participation in an HOA.\nA panel of experts reviewed the survey to ensure face and content validity of the instrument. The panel of experts included the Chief Executive Officer of the Florida Nursery, Growers and Landscape Association, an assistant professor and extension specialist in water economics and policy, the Director of the Center for Landscape Conservation and Ecology, the Director of University of Florida Water Institute, the Director and associate director of Center for Public Issues Education, an assistant professor specializing in agricultural communication, an emeritus professor specializing in biological and agricultural engineering, a post-doctoral associate, a graduate student, a research analyst, and a research coordinator who had been studying water issues.\nData for the two surveys were collected using a non-probability opt-in sampling method by collaborating with a public opinion survey research company. Non-probability sampling methods have been commonly used in public opinion research (Baker et al., 2013) . Since non-probability sampling methods strive to represent the population, participation rates are used rather than response rates with participants gradually invited to participate until specific quotas are filled (Baker et al., 2013) . The participation rate for the general public survey was 67% with 767 individuals invited to enter the survey resulting in 516 useable responses. Post-stratification weighting methods were used (Kalton & Flores-Cervantes, 2003) to enhance the representativeness of the results and overcome the limitations of non-probability sampling, including non-participation biases, selection, and exclusion (Baker et al., 2013) .\nAs for the survey of the high water users, a participation rate of 25% was obtained with 2,028 being invited to take the survey, resulting in 512 useable responses that met the criteria, including living in specific counties and identified as having the excessive irrigation practices (Davis & Dukes, 2014) needed to classify the respondents as high water users and considered a large enough sample size to be representative of the population of interest (Baker et al., 2013) . Since quotas were used a priori to identify targeted respondents, data were not weighted. After collecting the responses to the two surveys, descriptive statistics and t-tests were conducted using SPSS \u00ae 22.0 to achieve the objectives of this study."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The demographic characteristics of the respondents in the two surveys are shown in Table 1 .

It is important to note a limitation of the study, which is that more respondents of the general public survey responded \"Does Not Apply\" than the high water users when asked if they let their sprinklers run when it has rained or is raining or when rain is predicted in the forecast. The large number of respondents in the general public respondents reporting \"Does Not Apply\" indicated they may not have a yard or lawn to take care of and therefore do not engage simply because they do not have the opportunity. Despite this limitation, the findings of this study mirror those found by others. Israel and Knox (2013) and Monaghan et al. (2013) found Florida residents involved in HOAs rarely adjust their water use behaviors regarding landscaping indicating a lack of engagement in water conservation behaviors.\nWhen it came to respondents' use of water conservation strategies, no differences were found between the general public and the high water users. This finding indicated both groups applied water conservation strategies, preferring to practice strategies associated with less labor such as installing lowwater consuming toilets and showerheads when compared to recycling water, a more time intensive task. While efforts have been made to engage the public in water conservation behaviors (Greene, 2010; Lee et al., 2013) , the findings from this study imply Florida residents broadly may not be willing to engage in water conservation behaviors if the costs (either financial or in time invested) are too great.\nOverall, the findings also indicated the general public was more likely to engage in water conservation behaviors than high water users supporting previous research on this group (Monaghan et al., 2013) . The exception to this was that both the general public and high water users indicated they were very unlikely or unlikely to save water by using a timer to take a shorter shower indicating that personal needs take precedence over saving water.\nWithin the listed water conservation behaviors related to landscaping, high water users indicated a low likelihood of engaging in the behaviors, which would sacrifice the quality of their landscapes. When compared to the general public, high water users were less likely to reduce their use of pesticides and fertilizers confirming research that high water users tend to put more effort into maintaining landscape quality and hold a high quality landscape in high regard (Israel & Knox, 2013) . Nevertheless, these findings also imply high water users may not be aware of the environmental impacts caused by their landscaping management practices.\nAccording to the concept of audience segmentation (Andreasen, 2006; Kotler & Roberto, 1989 ) a target group, high water users in this case, was identified through shared demographic characteristics. Similar to the characteristics identified by Monaghan et al. (2013) , the high water users in this study were characterized as older in age, having higher incomes and education levels than the general public. In addition, a larger portion of the high water user population lives within HOAs that regulates what they are allowed to do in terms of their landscaping practices and may impact their decision making. The findings of this study imply that high water users have a particular behavior pattern showing they care more about landscaping quality than adverse environmental impacts caused by water use behaviors. Since this is different from the general public, high water users should have extension programming developed specific to their needs to further delve into the importance of proper landscape care. This finding supports research that supported the use of behavioral patterns for audience segmentation when developing extension programming (Brunson & Price, 2009 ).\nMoreover, in spite of high water users' concern about landscape quality, the respondents did indicate a certain level of likelihood in engaging in water conservation behaviors and related societal behaviors. Such a finding implies high water users would be interested in conserving water to the extent that landscaping quality is retained. This supports Tyson and Broderick's (1999) findings that an audience's intention can be used as one of the components for audience segmentation. Conclusively, these findings imply extension programs can be developed in an effective and efficient manner by targeting high water users' specific needs (Andreasen, 2006; Kotler & Roberto, 1989) ."}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "text": "In Florida, extension professionals have developed broad educational programs to educate the general public about water conservation (University of Florida Extension, 2014). However, the influence has had a limited impact on high water users, who tend to consume a large amount of water for landscape irrigation (Monaghan et al., 2013) . Based on the findings of this study extension professionals should consider offering different programs for high water users than the general public due to their differences in level of reported engagement. In addition, when developing educational programs targeted at high water users, extension professionals should use materials more relevant to their needs and behavior patterns in order to improve the effectiveness of the programs (Adhikarya, 1994; Brunson & Price, 2009 ).\nThe high water users examined in this study indicated an interest in water conservation, revealing a potential need for educational programs associated with water conservation (Tyson & Broderick, 1999) . In the case of high water users, alternative landscaping practices that can improve water use efficiency while maintaining landscape quality would be favorable, and societal behaviors associated with authority, such as support of government restriction and voting, would also increase engagement. Extension professionals who design water conservation educational programs should also consider including water"}, {"section_title": "Journal of Agricultural Education 72", "text": "Volume 57, Issue 2, 2016 conservation strategies that require minimal effort and financial commitment. Materials and strategies easy to practice would likely enhance adoption.\nIn terms of future research, similar studies should be conducted in other parts of Florida known to have high water users to see if engagement differs upon geographic location or if high water users in general have the same perceptions since this research was focused on a specific part of the state. Further segmenting audiences could help drive extension programming in specific parts of the state as well as increase understanding of high water users as a broad audience. Future studies should also include examining high water users' interests in learning and participating in extension programming to facilitate program recruitment efforts. In addition, high water users' preferred communication channels should be assessed to improve effectiveness and efficiency in establishing extension programs that will be used. For example, this audience may not want to attend a face-to-face workshop but would be willing to watch online videos on their own time. Knowing this information would assist extension educators in focusing their time and attention in developing educational materials and experiences that would reach high water users as a targeted audience. Future studies are also recommended to assess any newly developed water conservation focused extension education programs targeting high water users to see what impact they have over time and if this specific audience is receptive to extension programming thereby reducing the amount of water used statewide, assisting in ensuring we have a future water supply."}]
