Tau PET imaging enables the in vivo characterization of tau distribution and its effects on changes in brain volume and cognitive performance in cognitively normal older individuals. Methods: Using 18 F-AV-1451 ( 18 F-flortaucipir) PET, we evaluated tau pathology in 54 cognitively normal participants (mean age 77.5, SD 8.9) from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. We assessed associations between PET signal and age, sex, race, and amyloid positivity using voxel-wise linear regression. We further investigated associations between regional PET signal and retrospective longitudinal rates of change in regional volumes and domain-specific cognitive function using linear mixed effects models adjusting for age, sex, and amyloid status. Results: Greater age, male sex, black race, and amyloid positivity were associated with higher 18 F-AV-1451 retention in distinct brain regions. Areas of likely tauopathy based on the intersection of associations with age and amyloid positivity were also identified. Adjusting for age, sex, and amyloid status, tracer retention in the entorhinal cortex was related to lower entorhinal volume (\u03b2 = \u22121.124, SE = 0.485, p = 0.025) and a trend to steeper declines in hippocampal volume (\u03b2 = \u22120.061, SE = 0.032, p = 0.061). Entorhinal 18 F-AV-1451 retention was also associated with steeper decline in memory performance (\u03b2 = \u22120.086, SE = 0.039, p = 0.029), and signal in Braak III/IV regions was associated with steeper decline in verbal long-delay free recall (\u03b2 = \u22120.163, SE = 0.073, p = 0.026).

Hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein, which normally promotes assembly and stability of microtubules in the nervous system [1] , leads to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). NFTs are observed at autopsy in brains of almost all individuals above 70 regardless of cognitive status, 5 and tau burden correlates with brain atrophy and lower performance on neuropsychological testing prior to death [2] . NFTs in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus in the absence of amyloid deposition and clinical symptomatology has been referred to as primary age-related tauopathy (PART) and is common in older adults [3] . However, there is currently no consensus as to whether PART is distinct from the continuum of AD [4] , and a recent study from our group indicated that 47% of individuals aged \u2265 85 years with PART had 10 cognitive impairment [5] .\nIn preclinical AD, in which individuals exhibit AD neuropathology but remain cognitively normal (CN) [6] , tau pathology is hypothesized to be one of the earliest pathophysiological changes [7] , with tau spreading from the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus to the neocortex at later disease stages [8] . Given that the preclinical stages of AD are thought to present the best opportunity for intervention to prevent or mitigate neuronal and 15 cognitive deterioration, it is important to understand how tau pathology in the earliest stages might modulate brain structure and cognition to better inform the development of therapeutics. In addition, understanding whether tau in the absence of amyloid deposition contributes to neurodegeneration and cognitive changes may provide insights into the optimal time frame for administering interventions aimed at modifying tau pathology.\nThe advent of tau radiotracers for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has enabled the in vivo 20 characterization of pathological tau, providing an important tool for understanding its correlates in aging and the earliest stages of preclinical AD. Several studies have investigated factors associated with tau PET signal, but most analyses include clinically impaired along with CN individuals, limiting the generalizability of these results. Cross-sectional studies including participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD in addition to CN individuals have shown that higher temporal lobe tau PET signal is associated with lower memory 25 performance [9, 10] , and that lower hippocampal volume is associated with greater tau radiotracer retention in the same region [10, 11] . Pontecorvo and colleagues also reported associations between higher neocortical tau PET signal and greater cognitive impairment among amyloid positive individuals [12] . Longitudinal studies including individuals ranging from CN to demented have further found that higher baseline tau PET signal is associated with greater longitudinal rates of brain volume loss [13, 14] and global cognitive decline [15] [16] [17] ."}, {"section_title": "30", "text": "The scientific literature assessing the relationships of tau PET with cognition and brain volume in samples consisting only of CN individuals remains sparse. In a study of 30 CN older adults, adjusting for age, sex, and a continuous measure of overall brain amyloid burden, tau PET signal in a composite of the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus was associated with steeper longitudinal decline in episodic memory preceding PET as well as lower episodic memory at the time of PET [18] . A study of 133 clinically healthy older adults reported a 35 cross-sectional association between entorhinal tau burden and subjective cognitive complaints, independent of amyloid pathology [19] . However, another study of 109 CN older individuals found no cross-sectional associations between regional tau PET signal and a composite cognitive score [20] . The association of tau PET signal with regional brain volume among CN participants is even less thoroughly explored. One cross-sectional study of 88 CN participants found negative local correlations between tau PET signal and gray matter volume 40 intensity, especially in the inferior temporal gyrus and medial temporal lobe [21] . Moreover, these authors showed that tau PET signal in these areas also corresponded to widespread reduction in gray matter across the cortex.\nStudying tau PET signal among CN individuals is challenging given that tau deposition is not as widespread in this population as in impaired individuals, and signal due to tau is relatively low and confounded by 45 non-specific binding with current radiotracers [22, 23] . There is a need for further investigation of correlates of tau PET signal, particularly among CN individuals, to better distinguish specific from non-specific binding.\nIn this study, we first identified factors associated with tau PET signal in a sample of 54 CN older adults from the National Institute on Aging Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) using voxel-wise linear regression. We then characterized areas where tau PET signal is more likely to reflect the tau pathology present in preclinical AD, rather than non-specific binding, based on the associations of the signal with amyloid positivity and age. Finally, we examined the relationships between regional tracer retention and retrospective longitudinal measures of regional brain volume and cognitive performance. We hypothesized that age and amyloid positivity would be associated with tau PET signal given the relevance of these two factors for AD progression. We also hypothesized that tau PET signal would explain retrospective brain volume loss in corresponding regions and cognitive decline in domains known to be affected early in AD, particularly memory."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "The study sample included CN BLSA participants with a 18 F-AV-1451 ( 18 F-flortaucipir) tau PET, a 60 11 C-Pittsburgh compound B ( 11 C-PiB) amyloid PET within 2.2 years of tau PET, and a structural MRI.

We transformed these MNI coordinates into Talairach coordinates [47] using an in-house Python implementation of the coordinate look-up procedure implemented in BioImage Suite Web, which is 145 based on a non-linear mapping between a digitized Talairach atlas and the MNI template [48] . We performed a 9 mm-wide cube range search using the Talairach Client (http://www.talairach.org/client.html) to obtain anatomical labels for each peak and subpeak. The label with the most hits in the cube was chosen as the corresponding anatomical label. For top hits that were not assigned a Brodmann area (BA) in the Talairach client output, if there was another hit with the same anatomical label as the top hit, we report their 150 BA where applicable. All label and BA assignments were confirmed via visual inspection and corrected as necessary.\nGiven that voxel-wise analyses might be susceptible to inter-subject registration errors, we tested the relationship between these predictors and regional 18 F-AV-1451 SUVR means computed in native PET space to verify our voxel-wise findings. Six anatomical ROIs were selected based on the observed voxel-wise effects 155 and these effects were corroborated using a native space ROI approach (see Appendix C).\nTo identify voxels where 18 F-AV-1451 PET signal likely reflects preclinical AD-related tau pathology rather than non-specific binding in our sample of CN older adults, we created a conjunction map of the statistically significant voxels for three different effects in our model. First, we restricted the map to voxels with a positive effect of amyloid status given that amyloid accumulation is thought to be the earliest detectable brain change 160 in preclinical AD [6, 7] . Next, we restricted the map to voxels with a positive age effect based on the hypothesis that tau accumulates with age in preclinical AD [49] . Lastly, given that we were interested in areas of greater age-related tau increase in amyloid positive individuals, we restricted the map to voxels where slope between age and tau PET signal differed by amyloid group (i.e., the positive age \u00d7 amyloid group interaction term). The resulting conjunction map thus includes only voxels where (1) the age association with tau PET signal 165 is stronger among amyloid positive versus negative individuals, (2) tau PET signal increases with age, and (3) where tau PET signal is greater in amyloid positive versus negative individuals. p < 0.05 was used to threshold each individual map and an extent threshold of 400 voxels was applied to the conjunction map.

We evaluated the crosssectional associations of 18 F-AV-1451 SUVR with age, sex, race, and amyloid status. Given that AV-1451 exhibits non-specific binding [61] and that SUVR measures are confounded by blood flow effects [62] , we sought to identify brain areas where 18 F-AV-1451 SUVR is more likely to reflect specific binding to phosphorylated tau. To this end, we employed a conjunction map approach guided by the current hypotheses in preclinical 255 AD research that the presence of amyloid enables, is a risk factor for, or is a biomarker of the spread of tau pathology into the neocortex [63] , and that tau pathology becomes more prevalent with age. Through this conjunction map, we identified the parahippocampal, superior and middle temporal, superior and middle frontal, and middle occipital gyri as the main areas of 18 F-AV-1451 retention that are likely to reflect tau pathology among cognitively normal individuals with elevated levels of amyloid deposition. Finally, we assessed 260 the associations between 18 F-AV-1451 SUVR and rates of volumetric and cognitive change and found that higher entorhinal 18 F-AV-1451 retention was associated with steeper decline in verbal memory and a trend to steeper decline in hippocampal volume.\nOur finding of higher 18 F-AV-1451 SUVR in temporal, temporoparietal, and frontal cortical areas among amyloid+ compared to amyloid-individuals is in agreement with previous studies of cognitively normal 265 older adults [18, 49] . In amyloid negative individuals, we found that 18 F-AV-1451 SUVR was lower at greater ages, largely confined to periventricular white matter and sulcal CSF which are regions of suspected non-specific tracer signal. Conversely, 18 F-AV-1451 SUVR was higher at older ages among amyloid positive individuals in the putamen, right inferior frontal, and right middle occipital gyri. The association between tracer retention and age modulated by amyloid status did not reach significance in the putamen, but amyloid 270 positive individuals exhibited stronger associations in several cortical regions. These findings suggest that the association in the putamen may be driven by non-specific binding whereas cortical associations may more likely be due to tau pathology. Similarly, the observed interaction between amyloid status and age might be reflective of cortical areas of faster tau accumulation among amyloid positive individuals. This interpretation is supported by the finding of a previous longitudinal tau PET study showing that amyloid 275 positive individuals had steeper tau PET signal increases in basal and mid-temporal, retrosplenial, posterior cingulate, and entorhinal cortex [64] . Another study of longitudinal tau accumulation showed increases in 18 F-AV-1451 retention over 1-3 years in temporal and medial parietal areas in healthy older adults [65] , in agreement with the regions identified in our conjunction map. In another recent study, individuals with baseline 18 F-AV-1451 SUVR in the second quartile exhibited increases over 18 months in inferior and lateral 280 temporal cortex and in posterior cingulate [17] . Men in our sample had higher 18 F-AV-1451 SUVR than women, mainly in frontal and parietal white matter and thalamus, areas that were not included in our conjunction map. Previous studies utilizing tau PET imaging have not shown widespread or consistent sex differences in tracer retention [49, 66] , and given that women exhibit a greater degree of AD pathology than men in ex vivo measures of tau [67] , it seems likely that 285 the sex differences we observed are largely driven by non-specific binding of the radiotracer. Additionally, we found higher 18 F-AV-1451 SUVR among black individuals in confined regions of the cortex. Black individuals exhibit lower levels of CSF-tau than white individuals [68] , but greater incidence of postmortem NFT in Braak V/VI in black individuals has also been observed [69] . Race-related differences in 18 F-AV-1451 retention in the choroid plexus have been previously reported [70] , but the proximity of most statistically significant 290 clusters to the edge of the brain in our sample suggests that these findings may be in part due to spill-over from non-specific meningeal binding of the tracer. Potential sex and race differences in tau deposition will require further study in large and diverse samples.\nAdjusting for age, sex, and amyloid status, we found that higher entorhinal 18 F-AV-1451 SUVR was associated with lower brain volume in this region and with a trend to greater rate of decline in hippocampal 295 volume. These findings suggest that tau accumulation may help explain differences in regional volume in certain brain areas, as well as variation in volume changes in areas relevant for cognitive processes affected in AD. Previous studies of the relationship between PET tau and brain atrophy have reported more extensive associations between tau pathology and regional volume. Iaccarino et al. [14] observed that greater 18 F-AV-1451 SUVR was associated with lower gray matter volume cross-sectionally in anterior frontal and posterior occipital 300 areas. Das et al. [13] also found that greater medial temporal lobe 18 F-AV-1451 SUVR was associated with both cross-sectional cortical thickness and rate of thickness change in amyloid positive individuals. Notably, these studies utilized cohorts that included both MCI and AD individuals as well as healthy controls. The absence of a widespread association between 18 F-AV-1451 SUVR and brain volume change in our sample suggests that associations between tau pathology and neurodegeneration are modest in cognitively normal individuals with low overall tau burden, but become more pronounced with the onset of symptomatic disease and cognitive impairment.\nAdjusting for age, sex, education, and amyloid status, we observed that greater 18 F-AV-1451 retention in the entorhinal cortex and in Braak III/IV regions was associated with steeper decline in verbal memory performance. This finding in cognitively normal individuals reinforces the notion that tau accumulation in 310 areas associated with the earliest pathological burden may influence changes in cognitive domains known to be affected in AD. We had found an association between amyloid status and steeper memory decline in a previous analysis using the BLSA amyloid PET data [71] . Interestingly, this association was not statistically significant in our current analyses including entorhinal 18 F-AV-1451 SUVR as an independent variable. This suggests that tau rather than amyloid deposition may be more strongly associated with cognition, consistent with previous 315 findings [9] . Retention in Braak III/IV as well as Braak V/VI regions was also associated cross-sectionally with worse performance in the attention domain, an unexpected finding that requires replication. Other studies have reported a relationship between tau burden and performance in multiple cognitive domains [15, 72] , but these findings were likely driven by the clinically-impaired individuals included in the sample.\nAD pathology has long been considered to influence cognition via its effects on neuronal integrity and 320 brain atrophy. Pathological amyloid and tau together at the synapse have been associated with altered calcium signaling, mitochondrial disruption, and impaired microtubule function [73] . Hyperphosphorylated tau in particular is thought to lead to neurodegeneration and brain atrophy via disruption of its microtubulestabilizing role, in addition to the influence of tau aggregates on functional protein trafficking, resulting in axonal and dendritic transport deficits [74] . Neurodegeneration in brain regions associated with cognitive 325 function may thus help explain the cognitive decline observed in AD. However, our finding that 18 F-AV-1451 retention was associated with memory decline but not widespread brain volume loss suggests that atrophy in areas relevant for cognitive function may not be the only mechanism by which tau accumulation can influence cognition. Indeed, some have suggested that alterations in the integrity of functional brain networks mediated by AD pathology may anticipate cognitive changes in preclinical AD [75] ."}, {"section_title": "330", "text": "This study has several limitations. The relationships between PET tau and cognitive and volume declines were assessed retrospectively rather than prospectively due to the relatively recent implementation of tau PET in the BLSA.

Our sample consisted of cognitively normal individuals from the BLSA, enabling us to study individuals in the early stages of tau pathology. In addition, by avoiding analyses of 18 F-AV-1451 signal in the hippocampus, we address the potential pitfall of choroid plexus signal contamination. Finally, our study takes advantage of the considerable amount of cognitive testing and volumetric data from the BLSA that allow us to make inferences about the influence of PET tau on retrospective longitudinal 340 declines.\nOverall, our results point to a relationship between tau pathology and early changes in cognition in older individuals, even for those without a high degree of pathology or cognitive impairment. These findings also suggest the importance of 18 F-AV-1451 PET for characterizing tau pathology in cognitively intact individuals and as a potential tool for predicting cognitive change early in AD progression. Future studies 345 should investigate prospective cognitive and volumetric changes in relation to both timing and spread of tau deposition and their utility in predicting the trajectory of AD pathologies and symptoms. Further, effects of tau deposition on changes in functional connectivity in brain networks underlying cognitive function may provide additional insights into the relationship between pathology and cognitive decline in preclinical individuals. 350 "}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "text": "We thank the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging participants and staff; the Laboratory of Behavioral Neuroscience Neuropsychology Testing Group; Noble George, Daniel Holt, Hong Fan, and the rest of the Johns Hopkins PET facility staff for their dedication to the BLSA studies and their assistance, and the Center for Biomedical Image Computing and Analytics for providing MUSE labels and their contributions 355 to MRI analysis.

To corroborate the observed voxel-wise effects of predictors of 18 F-AV-1451 SUVR, we used linear regression to test the relationship between demographics, amyloid positivity, and regional Note: * p<0.05; * * p<0.01; * * * p<0.001"}, {"section_title": "Appendix D. Peak tables", "text": "For each peak and subpeak, the label with the greatest number of hits within a 9 mm-wide cube range 620 search as determined using the Talairach Client is displayed in the tables below. For top hits that were not assigned a Brodmann area (BA) in the Talairach client output, if there was another hit with the same anatomical label as the top hit, we report their BA where applicable. All label and BA assignments were confirmed via visual inspection.
