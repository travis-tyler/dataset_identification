Increasing age, lower educational attainment, diagnosis of hypertension, diagnosis of diabetes, and increased BMI were associated with worse cognitive function and poorer verbal fluency.

Using serial measures of salivary cortisol in 2 population studies, we set out to answer the following question: Is HPAA dysfunction longitudinally associated with later-life global cognitive impairment and if so, is one cortisol measure specifically associated with cognitive impairment at follow-up?"}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Cohorts", "text": "This analysis integrates datasets from 2 longitudinal cohorts: the Whitehall II and National Survey for Health and Development (NSHD) studies (figure 1). The Whitehall II study is an ongoing study of men and women, originally employed by the British civil service, aged between 35 and 55 years and based in its London office (6,895 men and 3,413 women, response rate 73%) at recruitment to the study in 1985-1988. 16 Since the initial medical examination, follow-up examinations have continued approximately every 5 years, with each wave taking 2 years to complete. This study obtained Whitehall II data from 2002-2004 (n = 6,967), 2007-2009 (n = 6,761), and 2012-2013 (n = 6,318).\nThe NSHD is the oldest British birth cohort study, following a sample of 5,362 male and female participants born in 1 week in March 1946. 17 Between 2006 and 2010, when study members were aged between 60 and 64 years, 2,229 participants out of the 2,856 invited (78%) underwent clinical assessment at a clinical research facility (n = 1,690) or their own homes during a visit by a research nurse (n = 539).

In addition, participants were asked to generate in writing as many words beginning with S (phonemic fluency) and as many animal names (semantic fluency) as they could. One minute was allowed for each test; the observed range on these tests was 0-35.\nIn NSHD, when participants were 69 years of age, cognition was assessed in 2,149 participants using Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination, third version (ACE-III), with a total score of 100, divided into 5 domains: attention and orientation (scored 0-18), verbal fluency (0-14), memory (0-26), language (0-26), and visuospatial function (0-16). A customized version of the ACE-III was administered by iPad using ACE Mobile (acemobile.org/): 32 refused or were unable to undertake the ACE-III; 35 did not have fully completed ACE-III scores; 353 scores were lost through equipment failure. Complete ACE-III data were available for 1,729 participants (80.5% of those who received home visit). 20 From the ACE-III score, a 30-point scale directly comparable to the MMSE score was extracted in order to harmonize cognitive measures with the Whitehall II study. In addition, verbal memory and visual search speed were assessed earlier, when participants were 53 years old; these were taken to be measures of baseline cognitive function prior to the wave first measuring cortisol (see below). While phonemic fluency was assessed in writing by Whitehall II, participants in NSHD were verbally asked to name the words aloud. The 2 fluency scores were then standardized across individual cohort distributions.

Participants were asked to refrigerate the swab before posting the sample to the laboratory in a protected container. A booklet was used for participants to record information on the day of sampling including date of collection, wake time, and time each sample was taken. Salivary cortisol levels were measured using a commercial immunoassay with chemiluminescence detection (CLIA; IBL-Hamburg, Germany). The limit of detection was 0.44 nmol/L; intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variance were less than 8%. Any sample greater than 50 nmol/L was repeated.

In order to compare exposures directly, continuous measures (verbal fluency scores, CAR, log-transformed AM:PM ratios) were standardized to have a mean of 0 and SD of 1. Covariates were operationalized as hypertension (yes/no), diabetes (yes/no), BMI (continuous), and educational attainment (<O levels, O levels, A levels). Linear regression was used to estimate the longitudinal association of cortisol measures with later-life cognitive performance, years after the cortisol collection. The model was lagged such that the cortisol measure in the model was from one data collection wave prior to the cognitive measure and all estimates were adjusted by follow-up interval. Covariates used were from the 2007-2009 wave of Whitehall II and ages 60-64 of NSHD using complete cases. Models were also estimated using multiple imputation for missing covariates (20 datasets obtained through chained equations using the mi impute command in Stata). Univariate analyses were first performed between cognition with each cortisol measure and covariate, followed by a fully adjusted model. All data collected from Whitehall II from the same participant over multiple waves were clustered by participant. Finally, the same models were repeated with reversed outcomes and exposures, with cortisol measures as outcomes and cognitive measures as lagged exposures.

Women in both cohorts demonstrated a greater CAR; men demonstrated a larger AM:PM ratio. Transformation of the MMSE errors normalized the distribution to be sufficiently appropriate for the analysis (mean 0.87, median 0.69, kurtosis 2.62, skewness 0.08; figure e-1, doi.org/10.5061/dryad.vb3g6p1). Greater educational attainment was obtained by men in both cohorts while hypertension and greater BMI was more prevalent in men in the Whitehall II cohort. The mean and SD for each cognitive outcome and cortisol measure and prevalence are described in table 1. The interaction term between AM:PM ratio and sex did not reveal sex between MMSE errors and AM: PM ratio (p = 0.770), CAR (p = 0.902), or area under the curve (AUC) (p = 0.455), or between fluency and AM:PM ratio (p = 0.411), CAR (p = 0.880), or AUC (p = 0.223).\nThere was an association between AM:PM ratio and subsequent cognitive function in univariate (table 2) analyses (0.03 fewer MMSE errors per SD increase in AM:PM ratio per year, 95% CI 0.02 errors to 0.04 errors, p < 0.01), which remained when fully adjusted (0.02 fewer MMSE errors per SD increase in AM:PM ratio, 95% CI 0.00-0.03, p = 0.01) (table 3 ).

Increasing age, lower educational attainment, diagnosis of hypertension, diagnosis of diabetes, increased BMI, and increased delay between cortisol measurement and cognitive assessment were all associated with worse cognitive function (table 3) . Each was also associated with poorer verbal fluency (except follow-up interval). Overall, no prospective associations between cognitive function and subsequent cortisol were evident.\nFinally, in considering contribution of baseline cognitive function, corresponding and directly comparable cognitive assessments at baseline was only available for the Whitehall II participants (table e-4, doi.org/10.5061/dryad.vb3g6p1). In further multivariate analyses within the Whitehall subset, the prospective association between cortisol diurnal variation and later-life cognitive performance persisted even when baseline cognitive performance was adjusted for (table e-4, doi.org/10. 5061/dryad.vb3g6p1). For verbal fluency, the association was attenuated on adjustment for performance in the prior data collection wave (table e-4, doi.org/10.5061/dryad.vb3g6p1). Between measures of cortisol within each analysis, approximately 69% of the harmonized cohorts had complete measures of cortisol measures, later-life cognitive outcomes, and all covariates. All models were repeated using multiple imputation data to account for missing covariates, the findings of which did not differ from the main analyses (table e-3, doi. org/10.5061/dryad.vb3g6p1)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In our longitudinal cross-cohort study, decreased AM:PM cortisol ratio was prospectively associated with small impairments in later-life cognition and subsequently decreased verbal fluency following adjustment for age, sex, educational attainment, hypertension, diabetes, BMI, and depression. No prospective association was found between CAR and cognitive function at follow-up. No reverse associations were found between cognition and later-life cortisol measures. Taken together, these findings suggest blunted HPAA diurnal variation precedes and may contribute to increased risk of later-life cognitive decline in the general population.\nThese results should be interpreted in the context of strengths and weaknesses of the study design. A main strength was the large sample size made possible by integration of 2 longitudinal cohorts with harmonized exposures, outcomes, and a long history of collaboration, harmonization, and participation in consortia. 26 Second, the 5-and 9-year period from cortisol measurement to cognitive assessment allowed longerterm outcomes to be ascertained. Multiple cortisol sample collections over 24 hours allowed for accurate profiling of HPAA activity. Finally, cortisol collection from saliva instead of serum 11 minimized acute stress response caused by venipuncture while measuring free, unbound cortisol.\nNonetheless, challenges in cortisol collection were evident from the amount of missing data in both cohorts, and this is likely to be missing-not-at-random. For example, individuals with lower cognitive measures are less likely to have complete 24-hour cortisol profiles, introducing potential source of selection bias in our complete case approach. However, estimating these models again using multiple imputation did not produce different conclusions (table e-3, doi.org/10.5061/ dryad.vb3g6p1). In addition, while the 2 cohorts are comparable in most respects, the exact collection schedule for salivary cortisol differed (6 times/24 hours in Whitehall II; 4 times/24 hours in NSHD). As a result, while AUC would have been the optimal method to characterize cortisol profiling, AUC calculation would have been more accurate for Whitehall II compared to NSHD. AM:PM ratio was chosen as a measure of diurnal blunting instead to utilize 2 directly comparable collection points. In addition, cohort-specific estimates were affected through differences in data collection. Baseline cognition was only available in Whitehall II participants, while other specific cognitive domains were only repeated in NSHD participants. An association between diurnal variation and later-life cognition was still evident in Whitehall II participants adjusting for baseline cognition, and coefficient directions for search speed and verbal memory were consistent (though underpowered) in NSHD participants (tables e-6 and e-7, doi. org/10.5061/dryad.vb3g6p1). In common with other cohort studies, our findings may be subject to residual confounding and are specific to the population and era under study. Finally, translation of our findings into diagnoses of dementia was not possible due to the relatively low number of clinical cases in this age range. However, cognitive impairment as demonstrated by MMSE and ACE-III in Whitehall II and NSHD were uncommon at the ages we examined: while not a definition for dementia, MMSE scores under 24 were found in only 0.48%, 0. 78%, and 1.84% for Whitehall II waves 7, 9, and 11, respectively; and ACE-III scores of under 82 in 6.5% of NSHD participants at age 69.\nWhile there are relatively few studies of similar size for comparison, our finding that HPAA dysfunction is associated with later-life cognitive impairment is in keeping with findings of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging and the Longitudinal Aging Study of Amsterdam, which reported increased diurnal variation and random cortisol levels in similarly aged older adults to be associated prospectively with impaired cognitive function and Alzheimer disease risk, respectively. 11, 27 In addition, HPAA dysfunction had also been previously associated with prospective cognitive decline in cognitively healthy adults with positive \u03b2-amyloid on PET scans, suggesting that HPAA dysfunction may be a marker of, share, or even mediate pathogenic \u03b2-amyloid mechanisms in cognitive impairment that may represent early preclinical phases of Alzheimer disease. 28 Our findings also suggest an association between HPAA dysfunction and cognition only becomes evident at older ages, 27 in keeping with a sensitive period for cognitive decline. 29 Similar associations were not present at younger ages from both constituent cohorts: there were no prospective associations between cortisol profiles at 2002-2004 and cognitive assessments at 2007-2009 in Whitehall II 12 ; there were no cross-sectional associations between cortisol diurnal variation and cognitive measures at ages 60-64 in NSHD participants. 22 The specific association of AM:PM ratio with later-life cognition highlights the significance of blunted HPAA diurnal variation.\nAlthough the demonstrated effect sizes appear small, even small per year individual effects may have cumulative effect when considered at a population level, particularly when cognitive decline may subclinically progress over decades. Second, the finding suggests an additional mechanism apparently contributing to cognitive aging in the population, above more established risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension. This implicates HPAA dysfunction as a potential pathogenic factor towards later-life cognitive impairment, providing a possible novel target for future research and potential therapeutic targets. On a cellular level, blunted diurnal variation is associated with reduced synaptic plasticity. 14 In addition, blunted diurnal variation is hypothesized to indicate reduced capacity to adapt during aging and changes in cardiovascular profile. 15, 30 Consequently, reactions from endocrine, immune, and cardiovascular systems may be initiated or amplified to environmental and psychosocial stressors, contributing to negative health consequences such as dementia. 31 The lack of prospective association between CAR and cognition in our study may indicate a more nuanced role for CAR that is difficult to ascertain given data limitations within our study. Although associated with spatial memory, 32 CAR is thought to anticipate cognitive demands by taking into account previous experiences, 13 hence its absence in patients with retrograde amnesia, 33 after waking from a nap, 34 and when waking in the middle of the night. 35 Such a role for CAR is anatomically plausible, given hippocampal inputs to the hypothalamus and the function of the hippocampus to provide a cohesive construct and representation of the outside world by processing relationships with time, space, and environmental cues.\nGiven that a blunted HPAA diurnal profile may provide a physiologic substrate for incipient cognitive decline in the population, HPAA dysfunction could offer a potential target for disease modification in dementia. Selective inhibition of 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1, an enzyme selectively expressed in human hippocampus, cerebellum, and frontal cortex, that regenerates glucocorticoid from circulating cortisone, amplifying intracellular glucocorticoid concentrations, has been associated with improved verbal fluency in healthy older men, and verbal memory in type 2 diabetic older men. 36 Overall, the relationship between HPAA and cognition is complex; nonetheless, our findings support loss of diurnal HPAA variation as an early marker of later-life cognitive impairment and a potential future target for disease modification."}, {"section_title": "Author contributions", "text": "A.
