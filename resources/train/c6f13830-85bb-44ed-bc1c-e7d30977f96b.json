"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This First Look report presents selected findings from the Postsecondary Education Transcript Study and Student Financial Aid Records Collection (PETS-SR) of the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09). HSLS:09 follows a nationally representative sample of students who were ninth-graders in fall 2009 from high school into higher education and the workforce. Key research topics for HSLS:09 include secondary-to-postsecondary transition plans and the evolution of those plans; paths into and out of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) studies and careers; and the relationships between students' educational and social experiences in high school and their plans for and experiences in postsecondary education, work, and life. The HSLS:09 base-year data collection occurred in 2009, with follow-up surveys in 2012, 2013, and 2016, including a high school transcript collection in 2013. Between spring 2017 and fall 2018, as part of PETS-SR, all postsecondary institutions that sample members had attended were asked to provide transcripts for the sample members and complete the Student Records instrument. The postsecondary transcript data provide coursetaking information for the 2009 ninth-grade cohort members who enrolled in postsecondary education, allowing for detailed analyses of students' postsecondary coursetaking, credit accumulation (including college credits earned through dual or concurrent enrollment while in high school), academic performance, and degree completion. The student records data provide financial aid information for the 2009 ninth-grade cohort members who enrolled in postsecondary education after high school, allowing researchers to analyze price of attendance, tuition and fees, and various types of financial aid students received from their first academic year in postsecondary education through the 2016-17 academic year. The purpose of this report is to illustrate the range of information available in the PETS-SR data. The selected findings present examples of the estimates that can be obtained from the data and are not intended to address any particular issue . Tables 1a-3b of this report present results from the PETS collection, focusing on students' coursetaking experiences through June 2016 using the subsample of fall 2009 ninthgraders whose first postsecondary enrollment after high school was in the 2013-14 academic year. Limiting the estimates to students who began their postsecondary education in the same academic year ensures that outcomes are observed over the same time frame across the sample. 1 Tables 4a-6 present results from student records collected for fall 2009 ninth-graders who enrolled in postsecondary education after high school. These tables focus on tuition and fees students were charged and the various types of financial aid they received while enrolled at their first primary institution during their first academic year. 2 Although most (80 percent) of fall 2009 ninth-graders with postsecondary enrollment after high school began their postsecondary education in the 2013-14 academic year (see the distribution of students by first academic year enrolled in postsecondary education in table C-1 in appendix C), tables 4a-6 include all those who started in academic years 2011-12 through 2016-17. The report provides estimates for the total population and by selected demographic and enrollment characteristics. All estimates have been weighted to reflect the sample design and to account for nonresponse. This report is descriptive in nature; therefore, causal inferences should not be drawn from the results presented. Many of the variables examined in this report may be related to one another, but these analyses do not account for such relationships. Appendix A contains standard errors for all estimates in this report. Appendix B describes the variables used to generate these estimates. Appendix C provides detailed technical information on such aspects of HSLS:09 as its data collection instruments, sample design, and response rates. Readers may find additional information about the HSLS:09 dataset and the methods employed in collecting and processing the data in High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09) Postsecondary Education Transcript Study and Student Financial Aid Records Collection Data File Documentation (Duprey et al. forthcoming). 1 Tables 1a-3b include students who took postsecondary courses while still in high school (known as dual or concurrent enrollment) if they also enrolled in postsecondary education after high school and their first postsecondary enrollment after high school was in 2013-14. 2 Unlike the PETS outcomes, which are measured over time, the SR outcomes are measured within one academic year. This report focuses on students' financial aid awards in their first academic year, regardless of the calendar year in which they started their postsecondary education. The first primary institution is generally the institution in which a student first enrolled at the postsecondary level. For students who enrolled at one institution during the summer immediately after high school and enrolled at another institution during the fall, their first primary institution is the institution with the fall enrollment. Students' first primary institutions in SR tables were determined based on enrollment data in both transcripts and student records. These institutions may differ from students' first known institutions shown in PETS tables, which were determined based only on enrollment data in transcripts. Academic years are defined as running from July 1 through June 30. The first academic year is generally the earliest academic year in which a student was enrolled at his or her first primary institution. For students who first enrolled in a postsecondary institution in the last 2 months of an academic year and then enrolled the following fall, their first academic year is the academic year of the fall enrollment."}, {"section_title": "Selected Findings", "text": "For fall 2009 ninth-graders whose first postsecondary enrollment after high school was in 2013-14, postsecondary transcript data indicate that\u2026 \u2022 41 percent had taken one or more remedial courses as of June 2016 (table 1a).

The first follow-up of HSLS:09 took place in 2012, when most sample members were in the spring term of the eleventh grade. Students who transferred to another school, who became homeschooled, who completed high school, who earned a high school equivalency, and who dropped out were followed, as well as those who remained in their base-year high school. Sample members were asked to complete both a questionnaire and a mathematics assessment. Surveys were also administered to sample members' parents, administrators, and counselors. The 2013 Update survey took place between June and December 2013. The sample consisted of study-eligible students selected for the base year in 2009-10 who were not deceased as of the 2013 Update. The survey, which could be completed by the sample member or a parent, was designed to gather basic information about sample members' high school completion status or plans, postsecondary education and work plans, and the college application and financing process. Between fall 2013 and spring 2014, high school transcripts were gathered from all high schools that students had attended, including schools known from prior data collection rounds, schools identified by the student or parent during the 2013 Update survey, and schools identified during the request for transcripts from already known schools. Coursetaking records from transcripts were coded using School Courses for the Exchange of Data (SCED), a system for classifying elementary and secondary school courses into standard 12-digit codes reflecting their course content and placement within subjects. Course credits, course grades, and other measures derived from transcripts were standardized to ensure comparability across schools. 5 In addition, student records were matched to external data sources to obtain SAT and ACT scores, Free Application for Federal Student Aid data, and GED completion data. The second follow-up, conducted between March 2016 and January 2017, was designed to collect information from the cohort approximately 3 years after the modal high school completion date. The second follow-up survey included questions on a variety of academic and employment-related topics that include, but are not limited to, high school completion and experiences, college enrollment history and future enrollment plans, and employment and unemployment history. Between spring 2017 and fall 2018, as part of the PETS-SR data collection, all known postsecondary institutions that sample members attended were asked to provide transcripts and complete the Student Records instrument. The postsecondary transcript data 6 obtained provide detailed information about students' academic experiences, including academic performance, credit accumulation, enrollment periods, and degree completion. The student records data obtained provide detailed information about students' enrollment patterns, programs of study, tuition and fees, price of attendance, and various types of financial aid received from federal, state, institution, and other sources for each year starting from their first academic year in postsecondary education through 2016-17. The academic year in which sample members first enrolled in postsecondary education after high school varies, ranging from 2011-12 to 2016-17; most (80 percent) fall 2009 ninth-graders who enrolled in postsecondary education after high school began in the 2013-14 academic year (table C-1).

Noncourse credit, such as credit for an AP exam, was also entered in this section. To enhance the utility of the KCS and aid in validating the accuracy of captured data, the KCS includes such specific features as direct links to the transcript PDF and course catalog files, validated fields for value range and value types (i.e., numeric versus numeric string), and requirements that all fields of study and courses receive a code. 5. Financial Aid-federal, state, institution, graduate, and any private or other financial aid awards the student received at the institution from July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2017."}, {"section_title": "C.3 Sample Design", "text": "In the base year of HSLS:09, students were sampled through a two-stage process. First, stratified probability proportional to size sampling was used to select schools. Sampling and school recruitment resulted in the identification and contacting of 1,889 eligible base-year schools. A total of 944 of these schools participated in the study, resulting in a 56 percent weighted school response rate. This weighted response rate was calculated with the school-level base weight as the sum of the weights for the eligible, responding schools divided by the sum of the weights for all eligible schools. The target population at the school level was defined as regular public schools, including public charter schools, and private schools 8 in the 50 United States and the District of Columbia, that provided instruction in both ninth and eleventh grades. HSLS:09 base-year school and student samples are nationally representative and state representative for each of 10 states (California, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington). The target population of students included all ninth-grade students who attended study-eligible schools in the fall 2009 term. In the second stage of sampling, about 27 students per school were randomly selected from school enrollment rosters, and 25,206 of the selected students were determined to be eligible. 9 Of the 25,206 baseyear sample members, 25,184 were eligible for the first follow-up (22 were deceased or ineligible), 25,168 were eligible for the 2013 Update (a cumulative total of 38 were deceased or ineligible), and 25,167 were eligible for the High School Transcript Study (a cumulative total of 39 were deceased or ineligible). By the time of the second follow-up, 25,123 sample members were eligible; a cumulative total of 83 were found to be deceased or ineligible. Sample members eligible for PETS-SR consisted of those eligible as of the second follow-up who had ever enrolled at a postsecondary institution. Sample members eligible for the student records collection were a subset of those eligible for PETS, especially those who were enrolled in a postsecondary institution after the completion of high school or high school equivalency. For this round of data collection, 17,338 sample members were eligible for the PETS component and 17,230 were eligible for the SR component. The term \"regular\" refers to the setting and mode of instruction. Some examples of schools not considered regular are those that offer instruction in juvenile detention centers, schools that instruct only special education students, and schools where all the students may be homeschooled or where a mix of instructional modes is used (e.g., some students are homeschooled, some receive remote instruction, and some are in a common physical location). 9 Sample members were classified as study ineligible if they were not in ninth grade during the baseyear data collection, they were not enrolled at the sampled high school during the base year, or they were foreign exchange students. Study eligibility was confirmed during each round for sample members who had not yet been interviewed.  (Dalton, Ingels, and Fritch 2015), weighted response rates were calculated using the analytic weight, rather than the student base weight, for these five instruments. Therefore, for these five instruments, the counts of eligible and responding sample members and weighted response rates differ between those reported in the 2013 Update First Look report and those reported here, which were calculated using the student base weight. 3 A subsample of parents was selected to receive the parent survey in the first follow-up. Further details on the parent subsample design are provided in section 3.3.4 of High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09) Base-Year to First Follow-Up Data File Documentation (Ingels et al. 2014). 4 Weighted response rates calculated using the student base weight adjusted for unknown eligibility with respect to PETS. 5 Weighted response rates calculated using the student base weight adjusted for unknown eligibility with respect to SR.

Response Rates", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "C.5 Weighting", "text": "Analysis weights are used in combination with software that accounts for the HSLS:09 complex survey design to produce estimates for the target population, with appropriate standard errors. Estimates related to postsecondary transcripts in this report were produced using the postsecondary transcripts weight (W5PSTRANS), which permits estimates generalizable to the U.S. population of ninth-graders in fall 2009 who were attending schools with both a ninth and eleventh grade and who were ever enrolled in an IPEDS-participating postsecondary institution as of June 30, 2017. This weight is appropriate for analyses involving only postsecondary transcripts data. Estimates related to postsecondary student records in this report were produced using the postsecondary student records weight (W5PSRECORDS), which permits estimates generalizable to the U.S. population of ninth-graders in fall 2009 who were attending schools with both a ninth and eleventh grade and who were ever enrolled in an IPEDS-participating postsecondary institution as of June 30, 2017, after completion of high school or its equivalent. This weight is appropriate for analyses involving only postsecondary student records data. Both of these weights' corresponding balanced repeated replicate (BRR) weights were used to compute standard errors. All estimates were computed in PowerStats."}, {"section_title": "C.6 Nonresponse Bias Analysis", "text": "The weighted response rates for PETS-SR fell below 85 percent (table C-2). Therefore, in accordance with NCES statistical standards, the data were subjected to a nonresponse bias analysis. Unit nonresponse bias analyses were conducted for the sets of respondents corresponding to the analysis weights constructed for PETS-SR. Fifteen categorical variables were used to assess unit nonresponse bias. (Note that several of the 15 variables are derived from sampling frame data and are therefore not available in either the restricted-use or public-use files.) These 15 variables in total comprise 67 categories. For each category, estimates of bias were calculated and statistical significance tests were conducted. Bias estimates were computed for each set of respondents associated with each of the analysis weights. For each set of respondents, biases were estimated before nonresponse weight adjustments were applied to the sampling base weight adjusted for unknown eligibility and then estimated after nonresponse weight adjustments were applied to the sampling base weight adjusted for unknown eligibility. Appendix D of HSLS:09 Postsecondary Education Transcript Study and Student Financial Aid Records Collection Data File Documentation (Duprey et al. forthcoming) provides bias estimates for each of the 15 variables (with their corresponding categorizations) before and after weight adjustments. Further information on the procedures for evaluating nonresponse bias and for their results can be found in chapter 5 of the same report. Overall, none of the variable categories exhibited significant estimated bias after all weighting adjustments. The results of these nonresponse bias analyses suggest that there is not substantial bias on the variables examined due to nonresponse after adjusting for that nonresponse. However, it is not possible to directly assess bias on the transcript and SR data because these data are not available for nonrespondents."}, {"section_title": "C.7 Imputation", "text": "Imputation addresses the potential concern related to missing values in the data supplied by respondents. Advantages of using imputed values include the ability to use all study respondent records in an analysis (complete-case analysis), which affords more power for statistical tests. Additionally, if the imputation procedure is effective (i.e., the imputed value is equal to, or close to, the true value), the analysis results are likely less biased than those produced with the incomplete data file. (On both the benefits and techniques of imputation, see, for example, Little and Rubin [2002].) To alleviate the problem of missing data from a respondent record, statistical imputation methods were employed for the second follow-up that were similar to those used for the HSLS:09 base year, first follow-up, and 2013 Update. Twenty-one key analysis variables were identified for single-value imputation from the PETS-SR data. Additional variables were considered for this list but were excluded because of either high item-level response rates or they were deemed to be of lesser analytic importance. Stochastic methods were used to impute the missing values. Indicator variables (flags) were created to allow users to easily identify the imputed cases. A listing of the imputed variables and further information on imputation procedures and quality checks can be found in chapter 5 of HSLS:09 Postsecondary Education Transcript Study and Student Financial Aid Records Collection Data File Documentation (Duprey et al. forthcoming). The disclosure treatment methods used to produce the HSLS:09 PETS-SR restricted-use and public-use data files include variable recoding, suppression, and swapping. Swapping was applied to both restricted-use and public-use data files, while variable suppression and recoding were used to create recoded versions of restricted-use variables that were suitable for inclusion in public-use data files. Restricted-use variables were reviewed for their suitability for inclusion in public-use data files. Some restricted-use variables were classified as high risk, meaning they could be disclosive, and their values were not provided in the public-use data files; rather, versions of these variables were provided in the public-use data files in which all values of these variables were suppressed. (i.e., all values of these variables were set to a \"data suppressed\" reserve code 10 ). Other restricted-use variables were included in the public-use data files but in a recoded form such that the recoded values represented at least 30 respondents. Note that a result of this recoding is that no strictly continuous variables are included in the public-use data files.
