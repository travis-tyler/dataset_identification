Twenty-two subjects (11 males, 11 females, 73-97 yrs) McMaster University, and each subject gave written informed consent to participate. The subjects in the present investigation were originally selected based on health status, not on physical activity levels. All of the elderly subjects could walk independently, without aids, and most stated that daily walking was a part of their normal activity. Health status of the subjects over the past 12 years was discussed during an initial interview. After 12 years, all subjects could still walk independently (some with the use of a cane), and were involved in other activities such as gardening and light household work. All subjects were generally in good health, and there were no incidences of any debilitating ankle injuries over the past 12 years. A few reported health problems such as hip replacement and bypass surgeries, heart attacks, high blood pressure, dizzy spells, and arthritis in hands and legs. None of the subjects were taking medications that would affect muscle contractile properties, for example, beta blockers or thyroid medication. One female subject could not have anything attached to the skin on her legs and thus could not be included in the 12-year comparison of isometric twitch properties. However, values were obtained on this subject for voluntary strength and passive range of motion.\nPhysical activity levels were then assessed using a questionnaire for the elderly from Voorrips et al. (1991) , who adapted a previous questionnaire designed for young adults by Baecke et al. (1982) . The questionnaire consisted of scores for household, sporting, and leisure activities, altogether resulting in a total physical activity score for each subject. To test the validity and reliability of their test, Vorripps and colleagues administered the questionnaire to 60 free-living, healthy adults (63-80 yrs), and found a mean physical activity score of 11.0 \u00b1 4.6, with scores ranging from 2.5 to 21.7. In the present study of 22 subjects (73-97 yrs), the mean score was 10.8 \u00b1 7.2, ranging from 4.7 to 24.6. This score reflects mainly moderate activities such as gardening or light housework, and seldom-vigorous activities such as jogging and regular sports participation."}, {"section_title": "Measurement of Muscle Contractile Properties", "text": "The same testing apparatus that was used in 1982 was also utilized in the present investigation. All measurements were conducted on the right ankle with the subjects seated in a vertically adjustable chair with the leg flexed 90\u00b0 at the knee. Isometric torque produced about the ankle joint by the dorsiflexor and plantarflexor muscles was recorded using the leg holder and footplate first employed by Marsh et al. (1981) . The inclination of the foot could be altered by rotating the footplate about an axis that corresponded to that of the ankle joint. Torque acting on the footplate was sensed by strain gauges mounted on a rigid bar underneath the plate.\nAdjustments to the footplate placed the muscle group under study at its optimal length for tension development, according to earlier investigations by Marsh et al. (1981) and Saleetal. (1982) . The ankle was placed in 30\u00b0 of plantarflexion for measurements on the dorsiflexor muscle group, and in 10\u00b0 of dorsiflexion for testing the plantarflexor muscle group. Measurements of passive tension were recorded with the ankle in 10\u00b0 of dorsiflexion, and 30\u00b0 of plantarflexion. This measure indicates the stiffness of the musculotcndonous unit for transmission of contractile tension. Passive range of motion of the plantarflexor muscles was also measured by rotating the footplate into the dorsiflexion position, as far as possible, and recording the maximum angle in degrees."}, {"section_title": "Stimulating and Recording Apparatus", "text": "Prior to electrode placement, the skin was shaved, scraped, and cleansed with alcohol, and conducting gel was applied to the electrodes in order to minimize resistance. The stimulating electrodes consisted of a lead plate cathode (radius = 15 mm) and rubber anode (37 mm x 45 mm). For the dorsiflexor muscle group, the stimulating cathode was wrapped in gauze, dampened, and secured over the common peroneal nerve just distal to the proximal head of the (ibula, while the anode was placed on the anterior aspect of the leg, approximately 50 mm distal to the patella. For the plantarflexor muscle group, the pair of stimulating electrodes were placed snugly against the skin in the popliteal fossa overlying the tibial nerve, with the cathode distal to the anode.\nA high-voltage stimulator (Devices System, Model 3072, Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, UK) was used to deliver single 50 |xsec rectangular pulses to the peroneal and tibial nerves. The stimulating voltage was gradually increased until there were no further increases in evoked twitch torque; this was the voltage that was subsequently used to evoke the maximum twitch. Data were streamed continuously to disc using a Dataq waveform scrolling board (WFS-200DC; Dataq Instruments, Akron, OH) configured in an IBM-compatible computer system."}, {"section_title": "Maximum Voluntary Strength", "text": "For analysis of maximal voluntary strength (MVC), subjects were given several attempts to achieve as large a torque as possible during either a dorsiflexion or plantarflexion movement. During the MVC, the same stimulus as that used to evoke the peak twitch was given to the appropriate motor nerve, to assess the extent of motor unit activation in the muscle group under study. Attempts at MVC were continued until either no interpolated twitch was present, or in the case of incomplete activation, the torque output became constant over several trials. Post-activation potentiation was examined by eliciting a twitch 3 seconds after a 5-second maximal voluntary contraction, at the same stimulus as above, similar to the method in Vandervoort and McComas (1986) ."}, {"section_title": "B204", "text": "WINEGARDETAL."}, {"section_title": "Data and Statistical Analysis", "text": "Custom-designed Advanced CODAS software (Dataq Instruments) was used for analysis of maximum voluntary strength, as well as evoked and potentiated recordings of peak twitch torque (TT).

Overall, no significant effects for time were found in the percentage change from resting to potentiated twitch torque for either muscle group."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "This is the first report of a longitudinal assessment of ankle muscle function in very old adults (mean age 83.5 yrs). Since this study examined muscle changes over a 12-ycar period of aging, care should be taken when comparing these results with cross-sectional studies of aging, which tend to report differences between young and old subjects.\nThe loss of voluntary strength from 1982 to 1994 was significantly less for the dorsiflexors than the plantarflexors (7% and 28%, respectively). Christ et al. (1992) , in their study of women aged 25-74 years, also reported dorsiflexor strength was maintained to a greater degree than that of the plantarflexors. They credited the selective decline in the strength of the plantarflexors to the difference in the size of the motor nerves innervating the two antagonistic ankle muscle groups. Type II fibers, which are more numerous in plantarflexor muscles (e.g., gastrocnemii), are innervated by larger motor neurons that tend to be affected before smaller ones during aging (Kanda et al., 1986 ). Based on human autopsy studies, the tibialis anterior and the soleus muscles have been found to consist of mostly Type I fibers (around 73% and 87%, respectively), whereas the gastrocnemius, the larger plantarflexor muscle, is made up of approximately equal proportions of Type I and Type II fibers (Johnson et al., 1973) .\nChanges in postural activity of leg muscles could also contribute to greater Type II fiber atrophy. Primarily Type I motor units are recruited at moderate force levels. Because slower-moving older adults rarely reach high force levels or produce rapid movements, it is likely that Type lib motor units are rarely recruited (McDonaghetal., 1984) . Winter et al. (1990) studied walking patterns of the healthy elderly compared with young adults, and found the former adopt a safer, more stable gait pattern. For example, elderly subjects used a shorter step length, an increased support stance period, decreased push-off power, and a more flat-footed landing that required less power from their plantarflexors and dorsiflexors.\nSeveral mechanisms have been proposed to explain the age-related decline in muscle strength: loss of excitable muscle mass; changes in muscle morphology; changes in the nervous system and motor units; and decreased physical activity levels. Lexell et al. (1988) concluded that the loss of muscle cross-sectional area begins as early as 25 years, with approximately 10% decreased by the age of 50, and then almost 50% lost by the age of 80 years. In the present study, there was a significant decrease in body mass over the 12 years, which could be reflecting in part a loss in muscle mass, and in turn the loss in muscle strength.\nWith respect to the central nervous system, a progressive loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord (Lexell and Downham, 1991) leads to cycles of denervation and reinnervation within the motor unit population. As well, the number of motor units has been found to decrease beyond the age of 60 years (Campbell et al., 1973; de Koning et al., 1988; Doherty et al., 1993b) , whereas the size of the remaining motor units increases with age. Vandervoort and McComas (1986) also credited the reduction in strength in part to muscle denervation, since estimates of functioning soleus motor units in five of the oldest subjects were reduced by 70%, likely well past the point where reinnervation could maintain the normal strength (de Koning et al., 1988) .\nThe ability to voluntarily activate the entire motor unit population is another important issue when measuring muscle strength. In the present study, the retested subjects were all able to maximally activate their dorsiflexor muscles, which is in agreement with the study by van Schaik et al. (1994) that reported 96% motor unit activation. With respect to plantarflexor muscles, full motor unit activation is not as easily achieved (Belanger and McComas, 1981; Belanger and Quinlan, 1982) . Forty-three percent (9 out of 21) of our subjects could not reach full activation, compared to 22% (14 out of 63) subjects (60-100 yrs) in Vandervoort and McComas's study (1986) . Thus, central activation of the plantarflexor muscles appears to be affected to a greater extent than the dorsiflexors in older adults and may play a small role in the differential strength loss.\nTwo factors contributing to movement about the ankle joint are passive tension and range of motion. Passive resistive force of the dorsiflexors and plantarflexors increased from 1982 to 1994, while range of motion decreased. These findings have been confirmed in other studies of aging ankle muscles (Vandervoort et al., 1992) . The increased muscle stiffness is thought to be due to the accumulation of connective tissue within the muscle (Lexell et al., 1988; Rice et al., 1989; Overend et al., 1992) . Crosssectional areas taken of the plantarflexors have shown that although elderly limbs were of similar overall shape and exterior girth to young adults, the actual muscle size was smaller and there were greater amounts of noncontractile tissue located within its boundaries (Rice etal., 1989) . Thus, the weaker dorsiflexor muscles of older adults have greater passive stiffness to overcome when attempting to lengthen the antagonist group and dorsiflex the ankle.\nResting isometric twitch torque values were similar when compared to 1982 values for both muscle groups. The lack of any decline in twitch torque was not unexpected, as other investigations from our laboratory have also reported similar twitch torques between young and old adults (Hicks et al., 1991; van Schaik et al., 1994) . Vandervoort and McComas (1986) reported reduced twitch torque values in elderly (60-100 yrs) compared to young adults (20-29 yrs); however, the greatest decline occurred in the 60-69-year-old group, with smaller changes thereafter. The mean age of the subjects who were retested for the present investigation was 71.5 years in 1982, somewhat past the age when the greatest change occurred.\nFollowing a maximal voluntary contraction, increased twitch torque was observed, as has been previously reported for these and other muscle groups Belanger et al., 1983; Vandervoort et al., 1983; Alway et al., 1987) . Post-activation potentiation is thought to increase the state of readiness of muscle for movement.\nOne proposed mechanism underlying twitch potentiation is that fast myosin light chains become phosphorylated, which increases the sensitivity of the contractile element to activation by calcium (Houston et al., 1985) . Previously, the capacity for twitch potentiation had been thought to decrease with aging (Vandervoort and McComas, 1986; Petrella et al., 1989; Hicks et al., 1991) ; however, no significant differences were found in the percent of twitch potentiation from 1982 to 1994, for either muscle group.\nIn summary, the rate of decline in voluntary strength in this longitudinal study of ankle muscle function in older adults was greater for the plantarflexors than for the dorsiflexors; and in the former case, it was consistent with the 1982 cross-sectional data (Vandervoort and McComas, 1986) . In the future, it would be of interest to examine this issue prospectively with more subjects, including detailed analysis of the factors responsible for the apparent maintenance of twitch torque. It would also be useful to conduct a longitudinal study of structural changes in muscle and connective tissue using a technique such as magnetic resonance imaging; this would provide insight regarding the apparent differences in rate and extent of age-related losses in antagonistic skeletal muscles.\nThe loss of muscle strength with aging, and its reversibility with resistance training programs, has received increased attention in recent years due to important links between muscle impairment and disability in the elderly age group (Frontera et al., 1988; Brown et al., 1990; Fiatarone et al., 1990 Fiatarone et al., , 1994 McCartney et al., 1995) . Given the importance of plantarflexor muscles to standing, balance and gait, continued research in this area is needed to enhance our ability to promote independent living, and increase the quality of life of our expanding elderly population."}]
