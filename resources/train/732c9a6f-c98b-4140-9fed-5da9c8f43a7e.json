[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Hormone-related cancers occur in the prostate, breast, endometrium, ovary, testis, thyroid and bone (osteosarcoma) (Henderson and Feigelson, 2000). Hormonally-driven cell proliferation may elevate risks of these cancers by increasing the opportunity for genetic errors and epigenetic alterations or by amplifying such changes after they occur. Strong evidence for the role of environmental determinants in the development and progression of prostate cancer include: (1) large international variations in prostate cancer incidence rates, despite similar prevalence rates of latent disease in autopsy series, and (2) increase in prostate cancer risks among men who migrate from low-risk to high-risk countries (Donn and Muir, 1985). Despite much research, external risk factors that might explain most of the variations in prostate cancer risk between countries have not been identified. The absence of strong socioeconomic risk gradients within ethnic groups suggests that putative environmental causal factors are widespread. The major male sex steroids, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), play key roles in prostate gland growth and development. Testosterone is produced mainly by testicular Leydig cells and is converted by type II 5\u03b1-reductase in the prostate to DHT. Compared to testosterone, DHT has about 2.5-fold stronger affinity for the androgen receptor (AR). AR regulates transcription of androgen-responsive genes essential for growth, differentiation and function of the male urogenital tract (Culig et al., 2000). Among U.S. males, the lifetime risk of developing prostate cancer is 18% and about 234,000 new cases and 27,000 deaths occur annually (ACS, 2006). The most important non-modifiable risk factors for prostate cancer are age, family history and ethnicity ! 6 ! 7 (Henderson and Feigelson, 2000). Prostate cancer rarely occurs before age 50 but incidence rates increase steeply thereafter. Internationally, annual age-adjusted prostate cancer incidence rates vary from about 12 cases per 100,000 males in Japan to over 80 in the USA, Finland, Sweden, Iceland and New Zealand (IARC, 2005). Prostate cancer incidence rates among African-Americans are almost double those for the U.S. white population (Stanford et al., 1999). The introduction of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test for prostate cancer during the late 1980's enabled detection of asymptomatic cases. U.S. prostate cancer incidence rates increased sharply during the early 1990's (Potosky et al., 1995) and then declined (Chu et al., 2003).

Similarly, a Norwegian prospective cohort study observed a positive association between birth weight and metastatic prostate cancer (Nilsen et al., 2005). The association was stronger for combined high birth weight and birth length. A Norwegian cohort study found increased prostate cancer risk among tall men (Engeland et al., 2003). A cohort study of US male health professionals reported a similar association (Giovannucci et al., 2004) but an Australian cohort study revealed no relationship (MacInnis et al., 2003). A meta-analysis of 31 cohort and 25 case-control studies reported a dose-response relationship between adult height and prostate cancer risk (MacInnis and English 2006).

In a California cohort study, prostate cancer was positively associated with baseline plasma androstenedione but not with total testosterone or SHBG levels (Barrett-Connor et al., 1990). In the Physician's Health Study, there was a doseresponse relationship between prostate cancer risk and baseline plasma testosterone levels, after simultaneous adjustment for other hormone and SHBG levels (Gann et al., 1996). A meta-analysis of 8 cohort studies concluded that there was no relationship between development of prostate cancer and baseline serum or plasma concentrations of free or total testosterone, DHT, androstenedione or dihydroepiandrosterone sulphate (Eaton et al., 1999). However, a meta-analysis of 2 cohorts (Gann et al., 1996;Hsing and Comstock, 1993) that adjusted for BMI and all measured serum hormones reported a 234% increase in risk for 4 th vs 1 st quartile total serum or plasma testosterone levels (Shaneyfelt et al., 2000). A case-control study nested with a cohort of Scandinavian men found a weak inverse dose-response relationship between prostate cancer and serum or plasma total testosterone and no association with free testosterone (Stattin et al., 2004a). The US Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial showed that healthy men given finasteride, an inhibitor of 5\u03b1-reductase, had an overall 25% reduced risk of prostate cancer during a 7year follow-up but a significantly higher proportion of aggressive cancers (Thompson et al., 2003). In sum, epidemiologic studies provide inconsistent evidence for a role of endogenous androgen levels in prostate cancer development. However, there remains the possibility that endogenous androgen levels and exposure to exogenous endocrine toxicants during gestation, childhood or adulthood may influence initiation and promotion of prostate cancer."}, {"section_title": "Estrogens", "text": "Prostate cancer was not associated with baseline plasma estrone or 17-beta-estradiol (E2) levels in a California cohort (Barrett-Connor et al., 1990). A case-control study nested within the Physicians' Health Study cohort reported a non-linear inverse association between prostate cancer and plasma E2 (Gann et al., 1996). A meta-analysis of 8 cohort studies concluded that there was no relationship between development of prostate cancer and baseline serum concentrations of estrone or E2 (Eaton et al., 1999). In subsequently published studies, the Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial found reduced prostate cancer risks among men in the 4 th quartile of baseline total or free serum E2 concentrations (Chen et al., 2003) but an Australian cohort study showed no association with baseline plasma E2 levels (Severi et al., 2006). A large international pooled analysis yielded no evidence for an association with polymorphisms of the HSD17B1 gene, which encodes the 17HSD type 1 enzyme that converts estrone to the more active E2 (Kraft et al., 2005). Estrogens are metabolized to catechol estrogens by cytochrome P450 enzymes encoded by the genes CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. Until they are inactivated by catechol-Omethyltransferase (COMT), catechol estrogens generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that produce oxidative DNA damage. In experimental animals, prenatal estrogen exposure imprints the prostate to undergo increased proliferation, inflammation and dysplastic epithelial changes later in life (Harkonen and Makela, 2004;Huang et al., 2004). The latter authors hypothesized a mechanism involving up-regulation of estrogen receptor alpha (ER-\u03b1), producing altered steroid receptor expression in the prostate gland, disruption of critical developmental genes and interference with prostate gland growth and differentiation. Ethinyl estradiol (EE) and testosterone acted synergistically to promote prostate cancer induction by 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (DMAB) in experimental animals (Mori et al., 1996). Aromatase, the enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens, is expressed in prostate cancer epithelial cells but its potential role in prostate cancer development is undefined (Ellem and Risbridger, 2006).

The association with family history was somewhat stronger for cases diagnosed before age 60 and for men with an affected brother. A subsequently published Italian study also reported a positive association between prostate cancer and family history (Negri et al., 2005). Family history of prostate cancer may account for 5-20% of all prostate cancer cases (Hemminki and Czene, 2002;Negri et al., 2005).

A Chilean study observed increased prostate cancer risk among men with both the CYP1A1-M1* and the GSTM1 null polymorphisms but not among men with CYP1A1-M1* and GSTT1 null polymorphisms (Caceres et al., 2005). A Turkish case-control study observed no association between prostate cancer and CYP1A1 polymorphisms (Silig et al., 2006). Such limited and inconsistent findings preclude firm conclusions about the role of cytochrome P450 variants in prostate cancer. Although polymorphisms of N-acetyltransferases (NATs) may influence cancer risk by changing the rates of activation or inactivation of carcinogens, there is only limited epidemiologic evidence for their role in prostate cancer. In a European case-control study, prostate cancer risk was reduced among men with a slow acetylator polymorphism (NAT2*6/NAT*6) but not with NAT1 polymorphisms (Costa et al., 2005). No relationship with NAT2 polymorphisms was detected in two other case-control studies (Rovito et al., 2005;Wadelius et al., 1999). The former study found associations with rapid NAT2 and NAT1*10 among men with high intake of heterocyclic amines from meat cooked at high temperatures (Rovito et al., 2005). These findings suggest the potential for interaction between NAT polymorphisms and dietary carcinogens but require confirmation. GSTP1 occurs in normal prostate epithelium but is not expressed in most human prostate cancers and prostatic epithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions because of somatic CpG DNA methylation (Nelson et al., 2001).

In a study using brothers as controls, men with the non-deleted GSTM1 allele displayed an increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer (Gleason score \u22657 or clinical tumour stage \u2265T2c) and reduced risk of less aggressive disease (Nock et al., 2006b). Heavy smoking was associated with increased prostate cancer risk among men with the GSTM1 null genotype but not those with the non-deleted allele (Nock et al., 2006b). A Turkish case-control study reported increased prostate cancer risk among men with the GSTM1 null genotype but not those with GSTT1 null genotype (Silig et al., 2006).

A Nordic study reported a U-shaped relationship between prostate cancer risk and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations (Tuohimaa et al., 2004), while other studies found no relationship (Braun et al., 1995;Jacobs et al., 2004;Nomura et al., 1998;Platz et al., 2004a). Vitamin D promotes differentiation and increases apoptosis, thereby inhibiting proliferation of normal and malignant human prostate cells (Tuohimaa et al., 2005). The limited and inconsistent evidence for associations between prostate cancer and serum or plasma levels of activated vitamin D metabolites precludes firm conclusions. Calcium intake (mainly from dairy products) lowers serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (vitamin D3) levels. A 2005 meta-analysis reported that men with the highest intake of calcium experienced a 39% increase in risk for prostate cancer (Gao et al., 2005). Two subsequently published cohort studies reported dose-response relationships between higher dietary calcium intake and risk of advanced or fatal prostate cancer and (Giovannucci et al., 2006) or all incident prostate ! 26 ! 27 cancers (Tseng et al., 2005).

A recent US cohort study of male health professionals found that dietary energy intake was not associated with incident prostate cancer but was positively associated with metastatic or fatal disease (Platz et al., 2003). This association was stronger among men with low BMI or small waist circumference and those who were more physically active. Finally, the association with energy intake was limited to men below age 65 and those with a positive family history."}, {"section_title": "Obesity and physical activity", "text": "Although a review of 23 epidemiologic studies published up to 2000 found inconsistent evidence of a relationship between BMI and prostate cancer (Nomura, 2001), several studies found supportive evidence. In the Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS-II), prostate cancer deaths were positively associated with obesity (Rodriguez et al., 2001). Prostate cancer was positively associated with waist:hip ratio but not BMI in a Chinese case-control study (Hsing et al., 2000). The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging observed a non-linear positive relationship between waist:hip ratio and prostate cancer risk (Hubbard et al., 2004). A Norwegian cohort study revealed a weak overall positive association between prostate cancer and BMI and a stronger relationship among the subgroup age 50-59 (Engeland et al., 2003). An Australian cohort study observed no overall association between measured BMI and prostate cancer but did find a positive relationship among the subgroup with aggressive disease (MacInnis et al., 2003). A recent meta-analysis reported that each 5 kg/m 2 increase in BMI was associated with a 5% increase in risk for prostate cancer increasing to 12% for those with advanced disease (MacInnis and English, 2006). A review of 30 epidemiological studies categorized the level of evidence supporting an inverse association between physical activity and prostate cancer as probable (Friedenreich and Orenstein, 2002) Among studies reporting a protective effect, risk for prostate cancer was reduced by about 10-30%. In the Netherlands Cohort Study, overall prostate cancer risk was not related to baseline occupational or non-occupational physical activity or history of sports participation (Zeegers et al., 2005). Both the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the ACS II cohort found no overall relationship between prostate cancer and physical activity (Giovannucci et al., 2005;Patel et al., 2005). However, the former study observed reduced risk of advanced prostate cancer among men in the highest category of vigorous activity and the latter study reported reduced risk of aggressive disease among physically active men. In sum, available epidemiologic evidence supports associations between prostate cancer and obesity or reduced physical activity.  -Fabry et al., 2006).

Further analysis of AHS data revealed positive associations between prostate cancer and use of chlorinated pesticides (DDT and several other banned organochlorine insecticides and two banned phenoxy herbicides) among men age 50 or older and methyl bromide and a non-significant relationship with captan use (Alavanja et al., 2003). Among men with a family history of prostate cancer, the AHS found positive associations with several specific pesticides including butylate, carbofuran and coumaphos. However, the odds ratios were not adjusted for use of other specific pesticides. The AHS found no association between prostate cancer and occupational use of metolachlor (Rusiecki et al., 2006) or atrazine (Rusiecki et al., 2004).

Although cadmium produced prostate cancer in rodents, two reviews found inadequate evidence of a role in human prostate cancer (IARC, 1994;Verougstraete et al., 2003) Meta-analyses of workers in the petroleum industry and the rubber and tire manufacturing industry showed little evidence for an association with prostate cancer (Stewart et al., 1999;Wong and Raabe 2000). An Australian petroleum industry cohort found an increased risk of prostate cancer prostate cancer (Gun et al., 2006). In sum, several specific occupations or work-related exposures are positively associated with prostate cancer in epidemiological studies but the evidence is inconclusive because of methodological limitations, especially the lack of direct exposure measurements (most studies used job titles as proxies for exposure assessment) and low statistical power (Parent and Siemiatycki, 2001). To the extent that any of these associations reflect causal relationships, potential mechanisms for at least some include hormonal modulation but this remains a theoretical possibility (Muir, 2005). Hickey et al (2001) concluded that smoking was inconsistently associated with prostate cancer in many well-designed cohort and case-control studies.. Prostate cancer was positively associated with smoking in two studies (Plaskon et al., 2003;Sharpe and Siemiatycki, 2001).

A Finnish cohort study found an increased risk of prostate cancer among smokers (Malila et al., 2006). Although the mechanism whereby smoking might enhance prostate cancer risk is unknown, current smokers had higher serum free and total testosterone levels than nonsmokers and testosterone levels decreased after smoking cessation (Trummer et al., 2002). CpG methylation of the genes adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), pi-class glutathione S-transferase (GSTP1) and multidrug resistance (MDR1) was positively associated with prostate cancer Gleason score; current smokers had higher CpG methylation compared to never smokers (Enokida et al., 2006). Two studies found apparent interactions between smoking and polymorphisms including the GSTM1 null genotype (Nock et al., 2006b) and combined occurrence of p53cd72 Pro and CYP1A1 M1 (Quinones et al., 2006).

A recent cohort study reported increased prostate cancer risk among men who consumed large amounts of alcohol infrequently (Platz et al., 2004b). An Australian cohort study showed that men who consumed 1-19 g/day of alcohol had a normal risk of non-aggressive prostate cancer and a reduced risk of aggressive disease (Baglietto et al., ! 31 ! 32 2006). Alcohol (ethanol) is carcinogenic in rodents (Soffritti et al., 2002). Alcohol might increase prostate cancer risk through effects on plasma sex hormone levels, immunosuppression, inhibition of DNA repair or generation of genotoxic metabolites (acetaldehyde, free radicals).
