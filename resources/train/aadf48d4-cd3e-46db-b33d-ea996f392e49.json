[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Physiological studies examining variation in species' thermal tolerances and where organisms live relative to their thermal optima (Stillman, 2003;P\u00f6rtner & Knust, 2007;Deutsch et al., 2008;Tewksbury et al., 2008) have provided a valuable mechanistic basis for identifying the potential \"winners\" and \"losers\" in the face of continued climate change (Somero, 2010). However, because climate change is expected to significantly alter the nature and strength of species interactions (Sanford, 1999;Tylianakis et al., 2008;Gilman et al., 2010;Harley, 2011), temperature studies that focus on species in isolation are not likely to reveal the full suite of climate change impacts that are possible in a multi-species context. Recent work has begun to reveal the diverse consequences of warming for interacting species and the communities they inhabit. For example, experimental warming has been shown to strengthen herbivore-plant interactions (O'Connor, 2009), increase the relative importance of top-down versus bottom-up effects (Hoekman, 2010;Kratina et al., 2012;Carr & Bruno, 2013), and increase the strength of indirect interactions (Barton et al., 2009;Marquis et al., 2014) in natural food webs. Here we focus on the interaction between climate change and predator effects because predators frequently exert top down control on ecosystems (Estes et al., 2011) either by consuming their prey or via risk effects that induce changes in prey foraging behavior. Indeed, in many ecosystems, the effect of the \"fear\" of being eaten can rival or exceed that produced by predators consuming prey (Schmitz et al., 2004). Moreover, the stress that predation risk imposes on prey (Creel et al., 2007;Boonstra, 2013) may be particularly sensitive to climate change because predation risk and temperature can influence the same aspects of an organism's biology such as foraging, growth and development, and metabolic rate (Cossins & Bowler, 1987;Rovero et al., 1999;Sanford, 1999;Trussell & Smith, 2000;Trussell & Schmitz, 2012;Hawlena & Schmitz, 2010a,b). Mounting evidence reveals that predation risk can elevate prey metabolic rates (Rovero et al., 1999;Beckerman et al., 2007;Slos & Stoks, 2008), and increase the production of stress hormones (Boonstra et al., 1998;Creel et al., 2007Creel et al., , 2009, heat-shock proteins (Kagawa et al., 1999;Pauwels et al., 2005), and antioxidant enzymes (Slos & Stoks, 2008). These risk effects on prey physiology, and thus energy budgets, may reduce the capacity of prey to cope with the additional physiological stress imposed by warming, particularly if risk and warming effects are synergistic. Globally, intertidal communities will be subject to shifting environmental temperatures both during high tide as the seas warm, and during low tide when the confluence of weather and calm seas can drive temperatures to extremes (Denny et al., 2009). Hence, simultaneous changes in both ocean and air temperatures may strongly affect marine intertidal communities in complex ways. In temperate ocean systems, warming temperatures often lead to increased metabolic rates in marine organisms when temperatures remain within those species' physiological tolerance limits. Such changes in metabolic rate can drive increases in productivity rates and consumption at all trophic levels (O'Connor, 2009;O'Connor et al., 2009;Carr & Bruno, 2013). For example, important rocky intertidal consumers such as seastars (Sanford, 1999(Sanford, , 2002Gooding et al., 2009) and carnivorous snails (Bayne & Scullard, 1978;Yamane & Gilman, 2009;Miller, 2013) increase feeding rates as water temperature rises to peak summer temperatures. However, when water temperatures continue to rise to stressful levels, or when low tide temperatures hit peak temperatures, these species often seek refuge, curtail feeding, and exhibit lower growth rates (Largen, 1967;Burrows & Hughes, 1989;Pincebourde et al., 2008Pincebourde et al., , 2012Yamane & Gilman, 2009;Vaughn et al., 2014)."}, {"section_title": "5", "text": "During the summer, which is the primary growing season for rocky intertidal species in the North Atlantic, we used a novel outdoor climate change array to examine how predicted warming scenarios (Fig. 1) may modify the effects of predation risk on the foraging and performance of an intermediate consumer in a 3-level rocky shore food chain. Our experimental food chain consisted of the presence and absence of waterborne risk cues from an invasive predatory crab (the green crab, Carcinus maenas), an intermediate consumer (the snail, Nucella lapillus) that is a common prey item for Carcinus, and mussels (Mytilus edulis) serving as a basal resource for N. lapillus. Top-down interactions driven by risk effects from this predatory crab on snail foraging can strongly influence the organization and dynamics of rocky intertidal communities in New England, USA (Trussell et al., 2002(Trussell et al., , 2003(Trussell et al., , 2006a. We used snails from Nahant, MA, which is near the southern end of the range for N. lapillus in North America. Current summer temperatures, particularly during aerial emersion at low tide, may induce sublethal stress and occasionally approach the thermal limits for this species (Sandison, 1967;Etter, 1988;Leonard, 2000). If temperature projections remain within the range where sublethal stress is minimal, then one might expect snail foraging on mussels to increase in order to support increasing metabolic demands. However, such increases in snail foraging may not yield increased snail growth because metabolic demands can rise faster than energy intake (Rall et al., 2010;Lemoine & Burkepile, 2012). In contrast, if water and air temperatures become high enough to either increase the frequency and intensity of physiological stress or threaten survival, then one might expect decreases in snail foraging because they forgo feeding to seek refuge from high temperature. Moreover, increases in metabolic costs may cause further declines in growth as has been observed in other species (Yamane & Gilman, 2009;Vaughn et al., 2014). We hypothesized that the stress imposed by risk and warming would 6 combine additively to reduce snail performance and alter their community impacts by reducing foraging on basal resources."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Mesocosms and Experimental Design", "text": "Our outdoor climate change array contained 64 mesocosms (plastic tubs, 2.6 L volume) and was based at Northeastern University's Marine Science Center (MSC) in Nahant, MA. Each mesocosm contained a lower crab chamber (perforated 500 mL plastic container) above which we placed a square granite tile (7.5 x 7.5 cm) that formed the base of a 7.5 x 7.5x 7.5 cm mesh (mesh size 3 mm) cage enclosure. Water was supplied from the MSC flow-through seawater system, first to the interior crab container, and then flowed out into the main plastic tub to wash over the upper cage and out the drains (Fig. 1c, d). We initially stocked each cage enclosure with four tagged and measured experimental snails (juvenile Nucella lapillus; shell length 8-14 mm) and 30 mussels (Mytilus edulis; shell length 9-16mm) that served as food for the snails. In the predator cue treatments (+ Risk), we placed a single male green crab (Carcinus maenas; carapace width 60-90 mm) and 3 N. lapillus in the lower crab chamber of the mesocosm. These N. lapillus served as food for the crab and were replaced every 6 days. Although this approach subjected prey to risk cues for the full duration of high tides, which was the most logistically feasible approach for this experiment, we should note that previous work has shown that reduced exposure to risk cues also can produce strong responses in prey (Trussell et al., 2011). For replicates of the no-predator cue treatments (-Risk) only 3 N. lapillus, also replaced every 6 days, were placed in the lower chamber as controls. We fully crossed these predator cue treatments (-Risk, + Risk) with the temperature warming treatment (Ambient, Warming); there were 14 replicates of each treatment combination. In order to evaluate natural mussel mortality rates, we included 8 additional mesocosms (2 per treatment combination) that were manipulated as above but contained no N. lapillus in the upper cage enclosure. The risk cue and warming treatments were randomly assigned among the 64 mesocosms in the array, and the experiment ran 30 days from July 5 to August 4, 2010. A natural tidal cycle was recreated in each mesocosm by fitting two drains, one below the tile in the upper cage, and one above the top of the upper cage. The lower drain could be closed off by an electric-actuated ball valve (Aquatic Ecosystems, Apopka, Florida) to raise the water level in the mesocosm to simulate high tide, or opened to drain water away from the mussel and snail enclosure, simulating low tide. The drains in each mesocosm were isolated from neighboring mesocosms by one-way valves. We created a natural tidal cycle in the mesocosms using LabVIEW software (National Instruments Corporation, Austin, Texas) to cycle the valves using the natural predicted tides for the nearby Boston Harbor NOAA tide gauge. Mesocosms were exposed to low tide conditions whenever the tide dropped below 1.5 m above zero tide level, with a 15-minute period of high-low water level cycling at the beginning and end of each low-tide period to simulate the wave-swash that accompanies the transition between tide heights in the field."}, {"section_title": "Temperature settings", "text": "The low and high tide temperature increases in the warming treatments were based on projected air temperature and sea surface temperature changes for the Nahant, MA area. Projections were based on data available as part of the World Climate Research Program's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 3 (Meehl et al., 2007). Monthly average surface air temperature and sea surface temperatures from an ensemble of ten models from the CMIP3 database were extracted for 1961-1990 as a baseline, and 2090-2099 under the IPCC SRES B1 emissions scenario (IPCC, 2000) for the future projections. For each model in the ensemble, we extracted temperature data for the grid cell enclosing Nahant (air temperature) or adjacent to Nahant (sea surface temperature) for May through September, representing the primary growth season for Nucella in this region. The temperature difference between the baseline period and the end of the 21 st century was calculated for each month in each model, and the results averaged across all ten models. The mean projected air temperature increase was 3.01 \u00b0C, and the mean projected sea surface temperature increase was 2.46 \u00b0C."}, {"section_title": "Temperature manipulation", "text": "The water and air temperature warming projections from the CMIP3 dataset were used as target increases for replicate mesocosms of the warming treatment in the array. During high tide, seawater from the MSC flow-through system was heated using 500 W electric submersible heaters (TSH-500, JEHM Co. Inc., NJ, USA) and distributed to the warming replicates. Thermistor temperature sensors (01T1002FF Vishay/Dale, CT, USA) were used to monitor incoming ambient water temperature and outgoing warmed water temperatures, with LabVIEW software monitoring the temperature change and adjusting power to the submersible heaters as necessary. Ambient seawater temperatures within the mesocosms were within 1\u00b0C of seawater temperatures at the field intake of the MSC seawater system. During low tide periods, the temperature in mesocosms was monitored using thermistors mounted at the base of the upper cage containing N. lapillus and mussels. The mussels formed aggregations in the cages that covered the thermistors, and N. lapillus tended to occupy that same microhabitat as they fed on mussels within the matrix. Heated mesocosms had a 500 W infrared lamp mounted 20 cm above the substratum. Ambient temperatures were measured concurrently in control mesocosms, and the LabVIEW software controlled power to the heat lamps in order to maintain the heated mesocosms at \u00b0C above ambient. All temperatures were measured at 2second intervals to provide fine control over temperature conditions. We assume that the longterm projected average air temperature increases calculated from the CMIP3 models will be accompanied by a similar warming of substratum temperatures and organism temperatures during low tide. To assess the realism of the low tide temperature conditions in our ambient mesocosms, we made temperature measurements of model snails in the field at the MSC. On two mid-day low tides in August and September 2010, while the mesocosm array was operating for a separate experiment, we deployed a set of 8 silicone-filled N. lapillus shells in the intertidal zone. The model snails had a thermocouple mounted inside them, and the measured temperature was assumed to approximate live snail body temperatures (Vaughn et al., 2014). The model snails were set out in three types of southeast-facing microhabitats: sun-exposed barnacle beds, underneath a Fucus vesiculosus algal canopy, or in shallow crevices. The model snail temperatures were measured every 5 minutes for two hours during low tide, and compared to the low tide temperatures measured in the ambient mesocosms over the same time period.\nTemperature manipulation in mesocosms resulted in an average warming of 2.4\u00b0C (\u00b1 0.45 1SD) at high tide and 3.2\u00b0C (\u00b1 0.65) at low tide, compared to our target increases of 2.4\u00b0C and 3.0\u00b0C for high and low tide, respectively. Compared to field conditions on two sunny, midday low tides in August and September, our ambient mesocosms produced conditions (24.4 \u00b1 2.6 \u00b0C, 1SD) similar to those found in mussel beds under Fucus algal canopies or in shallow crevices (24.3 \u00b1 4.5 \u00b0C), both of which were cooler than model snails placed on sun-exposed barnacles (29.1 \u00b1 2.9 \u00b0C). The range of temperatures in the warming treatment (Fig. S1) remained well below the mortality limits for N. lapillus from Nahant (40\u00b0C for 60 min, Etter, 1988) and predominantly below sublethal heat coma limits for N. lapillus from colder habitats in the United Kingdom (30\u00b0C for 90 min, Sandison, 1967). Low tide temperatures inside the mussel matrix where N. lapillus resided exceeded 30\u00b0C for less than one hour during the 30 day experiment, and maximum temperatures in the ambient mesocosms only exceeded 28\u00b0C for one hour."}, {"section_title": "Snail feeding, growth, and growth efficiency", "text": "During the course of the 30-day experiment, we counted and removed dead mussels at 6day intervals during low tide, and replaced mussels to keep the density at 30 mussels per enclosure. In each mesocosm, we calculated the per capita number of mussels consumed by snails, M t , during each time period, t, as (D + N c )/S t where S t is the mean number of snails present during time t in a given mesocosm (to account for snails that died during a 6 day interval and did not contribute to mussel consumption), D is the number of drilled, empty mussels, and 10 N c is the corrected (for background mortality) value of N, the number of empty, non-drilled where N a is the mean number of empty, undrilled mussels in the autogenic control mesocosms (mesocosms without N. lapillus). We used mean values of N a (N a = 0.625, 1.000, 0.250, 0.125, and 0.625 for days 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30, respectively) because we found no significant differences in background mortality among any of the treatment combinations. For N = 0, N c = 0. The total per capita number of mussels consumed was calculated as \u2211(M t ). We measured the shell length of each empty mussel to estimate its tissue mass (Burrows & Hughes, 1990) and caloric value (19.5 J mg-1; Elner & Hughes, 1978). The per capita amount of energy acquired was calculated as above, but where D, N, and N a are the sum of energy from mussels rather than the number of mussels. While measuring N. lapillus foraging was straightforward, the proximal physiological effects of predator risk cues and changing temperatures is likely complex. For example, respiration and metabolic rate of N. lapillus will increase with increasing temperatures (Sandison, 1967), and stressful temperatures may be accompanied by additional energetic costs stemming from the heat shock response as demonstrated in related Nucella species (Dahlhoff et al., 2001;Sorte & Hofmann, 2005). Although we recognize this complexity, we use growth and growth efficiency to measure the integrated outcome of the myriad physiological changes that may occur when N. lapillus is subjected to predation risk and temperature stress because individual fitness is ultimately determined by these long-term measures of performance. At the beginning of the experiment, each experimental N. lapillus (n = 4 per mesocosm) was labeled with a plastic bee tag and measured non-destructively (Trussell & Smith, 2000) to obtain initial tissue mass. We measured each snail again at the end of the experiment and calculated individual wet tissue growth as final -initial wet tissue mass. Wet tissue mass was calculated by subtracting the dry shell mass from the total mass of the snail. Dry shell mass was calculated from a linear regression equation obtained by destructively sampling snails from the same source population as those in our experiment (Dry Shell Mass = 1.5455*Submerged Mass + 3.5055 mg; R 2 = 0.9997, n = 50). Mean wet tissue growth was then calculated for each replicate mesocosm. Tissue production was calculated by converting initial and final wet tissue mass into dry tissue mass using a linear regression equation obtained by destructively sampling snails from the same source population as those in our experiment (Dry Tissue Mass = 0.2874*Wet Tissue Mass -2.8393 mg, R 2 = 0.9816, n = 50). Dry tissue growth (final-initial dry tissue mass) was converted into tissue production using a conversion factor of 22.7 J mg -1 (Hughes, 1972). We estimated growth efficiency for each replicate by dividing the mean Nucella tissue production (J) by the per capita amount of energy acquired (J). N. lapillus that died during the experiment were removed and excluded from our analyses. Data from mesocosms with more than two dead N. lapillus (n = 4 mesocosms in total) were discarded from all analyses. This approach left 13 replicate mesocosms in the -Risk/Warming treatment, 11 mesocosms in the + Risk/Warming, and 14 mesocosms in the + Risk/Ambient and -Risk/Ambient treatments."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analyses", "text": "All analyses were carried out in R 2.15.2 (R Core Team, 2012). Data on the per capita number of mussels consumed, N. lapillus tissue growth and N. lapillus growth efficiency were analyzed with separate two-way ANOVAs (Type III SS) with predator cue treatment (+ Risk, -Risk) and temperature treatment (Ambient, Warming) as fixed effects. In the case of N. lapillus growth, we used a generalized least-squares model with a weighted variance structure for the Risk factor to account for greater variance in the -Risk treatment (varIdent in R package nlme, Pinheiro & Bates, 2000). We calculated \u03c9 2 and its 95% confidence limits using a non-central F-distribution (Sokal & Rohlf, 2012) to evaluate the relative magnitude of risk and warming effects in each analysis. To compare the effects of each treatment on different prey traits (foraging, growth, and growth efficiency), we calculated replicate estimates of the proportional reduction in each prey trait due to the different treatment types (+ Risk/Ambient, -Risk/ Warming, and + Risk/Warming) relative to the control group (-Risk/Ambient) as the mean value of prey trait p for the control group and V pi is the value of prey trait p in replicate i of the treatment group (see Trussell et al., 2008 for a similar approach). For each of the 3 treatment groups, we analyzed replicate estimates of \u2206 using a mixed-model ANOVA that included \"Prey Trait\" as a fixed effect and replicate mesocosms as a random effect. To correct for potentially correlated errors among prey traits within each mesocosm, we adjusted the degrees of freedom for fixed effects tests (indicated as P G-G ) using Greenhouse-Geisser estimates of Box's epsilon (\u03b5) when data failed to satisfy the assumption of sphericity. Values of \u2206 for the + Risk/Warming treatment group and its corresponding analysis were log-transformed to satisfy parametric assumptions. Pairwise comparisons among prey traits within each treatment type were examined using Tukey HSD post-hoc tests (Fig. 3). We isolated the effects of risk and warming on mussels from those due to snail foraging (autogenic loss) with two methods. First, in mesocosms that contained N. lapillus, we counted the total number of dead mussels that were not drilled and had no tissue consumed, which indicated that they had likely died due to causes other than consumption by N. lapillus. Because these counts were dominated by zeros, we fit a zero-inflated Poisson model to the count data with Risk and Warming as fixed factors, and used likelihood ratio tests to assess the importance of these main effects and their interaction (R package pscl, Zeileis et al., 2008;Zuur et al., 13 2009). To test for potential differences in the quality of mussels, we measured the shell length and dry tissue mass of live mussels in each pair of autogenic control mesocosms (those that contained no N. lapillus) at the conclusion of the experiment. We then fit an ANCOVA model to log-transformed tissue mass as a function of log-transformed shell length, with Risk and Warming as fixed factors, and individual mesocosms as a random, nested factor to account for the non-independence of mussels within each mesocosm. We tracked the number of N. lapillus consumed by green crabs when provided as food in the lower chambers of mesocosms, and compared the proportion of available snails that were eaten using a generalized linear model with a binomial distribution."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Impacts on prey foraging rate, tissue growth and growth efficiency", "text": "Predation risk (F 1,48 = 84.48, P < 0.0001) and warming (F 1,48 = 7.69, P < 0.01) significantly suppressed snail foraging ( Fig. 2a) by 42% and 14% respectively, although the interaction was not significant ( Table 1). The additive effects of predation risk and warming reduced N. lapillus foraging by 52% compared to the control conditions. We observed significant reductions in N. lapillus growth (Fig. 2b) in response to predation risk (F 1,48 = 61.24, P < 0.0001, 77% reduction) and warming (F 1,48 = 28.97, < 0.0001, 59% reduction), and the combined effects of risk and warming had a significant interaction (F 1,48 = 5.74, P < 0.05) that suppressed growth by 99%, to near zero ( Fig. 2b; Table 1). Growth efficiency was strongly reduced by both risk (F 1,48 = 45.20, P < 0.0001, 60% reduction) and warming (F 1,48 = 34.85, P < 0.0001, 53% reduction). There was no significant interaction between the stressors, but their combined effects reduced growth efficiency to below zero ( Fig.    2c; Table 1). The effect size, \u2206, of warming differed significantly between foraging, growth, and growth efficiency traits (F 2,24 = 19.0, P < 0.0001), due to much larger effects on growth and growth efficiency compared to the relatively small effect on foraging. Predation risk had significantly different effect sizes on all three traits (F 2,26 = 42.7, P < 0.0001), while the combined effects of risk and warming (F 2,20 = 52.7, P < 0.0001) resulted in significantly larger effect sizes for growth and growth efficiency than for foraging (Fig 3, Table 2)."}, {"section_title": "Impacts on the top predator and basal resources", "text": "Green crab survivorship was high throughout the experiment. Of the crabs that died and had to be replaced, five were from ambient temperature mesocosms and two were from warmed mesocosms. We detected no difference in the number of N. lapillus consumed by crabs in the ambient and warming treatments (\u03a7 2 = 0.03, df = 1, P = 0.86).

Hence, projected warming scenarios could enhance the foraging rates of ectotherms in the middle of food chains (O'Connor, 2009) thus offsetting the positive indirect effects of predation risk on basal resources. However, although temperatures in our warming treatment were predominantly below those that cause acute trauma such as heat coma or death in N. lapillus (Sandison, 1967), we saw significant reductions in snail foraging under warming. Many intertidal species live near their thermal thresholds (Somero, 2002;Stillman, 2003) and this appears to be the case for our study populations from Nahant, MA, which are close to the southern limit of Nucella's range in the western Atlantic. As a result, their ability to acclimate to or benefit from the temperature increases in our warming treatments may have been limited. Moreover, the effects of risk and elevated temperature were additive and together reduced snail foraging by 52%, further strengthening the positive indirect effect on mussels. This result suggests that top down control caused by changes in prey foraging behavior may be enhanced under projected climate change scenarios (Barton et al., 2009;Hoekman, 2010;Kratina et al., 2012), particularly in the many systems where risk effects play a strong role in the ecology of predator-prey interactions. When confronted with both stressors, N. lapillus had negligible scope for growth during the summer season when snail growth is typically fastest. The juvenile life stages of many species grow more rapidly under slightly warmer conditions, but such rapid growth is often accompanied by maturation at smaller sizes (Atkinson, 1994;Kingsolver & Huey, 2008), which can have strong effects on population growth because of the positive relationship between body size and fitness in nearly all organisms (Peters, 1986). The reduced growth we observed under warming further suggests that our experimental N. lapillus populations were close to their thermal tolerance limits and therefore had limited capacity to benefit from increased temperature. Hence, to predict the consequences of climate change we must have a better understanding of where populations reside on their thermal performance curves (Stillman, 2003). The conversion of ingested energy into trophic biomass (i.e., growth efficiency) provides a measure of both the stress experienced by an individual as well as ecosystem function in the form of energy transfer between trophic levels (Trussell et al., 2006b(Trussell et al., , 2008. Predation risk and warming strongly reduced growth efficiency in our experiment (60% and 53% reductions, respectively), and their combined effects led to negative growth efficiency and no tissue production in N. lapillus. These reductions in growth efficiency likely explain the mismatch between foraging effects and growth effects resulting from the risk and warming treatments. Warming alone reduced foraging by only 14%, but snail growth in those treatments was reduced by 59%, presumably due to increased metabolic demand created by warming temperatures thereby magnifying the effects of reduced foraging. Although debate continues over whether growth efficiency should decline with increasing temperature as predicted by theory (Angilletta & Dunham, 2003), the negative relationship between temperature and growth efficiency revealed by our experiment suggests that warming had strong adverse effects on individual physiology that ultimately may impact ecosystem function. Our experiment created simultaneous increases in high and low tide temperatures that intertidal animals are predicted to experience, but this approach prevented us from partitioning the effects of warming air and water temperatures. It is likely that we observed a mixture of nonstressful metabolic rate increases and energetically costly stress effects, with the negative effects of temperature stress shifting the balance towards reduced foraging and growth. Previous work with related Nucella species from the northeastern Pacific found that moderate warming of water temperatures within the normal seasonal range without warming low tide temperatures tended to increase snail foraging (Sanford, 2002) and growth rates (Yamane & Gilman, 2009), suggesting a positive effect of metabolic rate increases. Our increased water temperatures exceeded the current day summer maxima for Nahant during portions of the experiment, so it remains an open question as to whether the water temperature manipulation caused only positive rate effects. For northeastern Pacific Nucella, adding stressful low tide temperatures removed the positive effects of warming water temperatures, indicating that the additional energetic costs of dealing with stress at low tide could cancel out the positive rate effects of warming water (Yamane & Gilman, 2009). Although warm low tide temperatures might be expected to increase metabolic rates, there is evidence that some intertidal molluscs down-regulate metabolic rates during hot low tides (Shick et al., 1988;Marshall & McQuaid, 1991;Marshall et al., 2011). This response may mitigate some of the negative effects of warm temperatures at low tide, but when low tide temperatures approach the thermal tolerance limits of a species, such down-regulation typically ceases and energetically costly heat shock responses are employed (Dahlhoff et al., 2001). Our combined high and low tide warming treatment, which included natural day-to-day variation in environmental conditions that occasionally pushed snails near their thermal tolerance limits, clearly had cumulative negative effects on both the behavior and physiology of N. lapillus despite any potential beneficial rate effects caused by experimental warming. It is now well established that predation risk can alter aspects of prey physiology, such as metabolism, that will have substantial impacts on the energy budget available for growth (for review see Hawlena & Schmitz, 2010a). Our results provide further evidence that the combined effects of risk and warming are particularly taxing for prey. Thus the impact of projected warming may be more pronounced in food chains where risk is an important component of predator-prey interactions. It has been hypothesized that the adverse effects of predation risk on prey physiology, and thus energy transfer between trophic levels, may explain the general shortness of food chains (Trussell et al., 2006b(Trussell et al., , 2008. Because of these physiological costs, the ability of prey to convert ingested resources into secondary production (i.e., growth efficiency) that is available to other trophic levels is reduced. Thus, predation risk causes \"trophic heat\", which is energy loss from the system that otherwise would be available for other species to consume (Trussell & Schmitz, 2012). As a result, trophic heat can strongly limit the important ecosystem function of energy transfer to higher trophic levels. We suggest that further inefficiencies caused by warming may exacerbate this effect with important consequences for food chain length, which can determine ecosystem productivity (Carpenter & Kitchell, 1993) and nutrient cycling and stability (DeAngelis et al., 1989). Elsewhere (Trussell & Schmitz, 2012) we have argued that that species residing in the middle of food chains may play a paramount role in community organization and ecosystem processes because they must balance the trade-off between eating and being eaten (also see Lawton & McNeill, 1979;Abrams, 1984). Indeed, predation risk exerts a strong influence on intermediate consumers in many systems (see Peacor & Werner, 2003;Schmitz et al., 2004;Long & Hay, 2012) and diversity in food webs is dominated (~60% of the total species) by species occupying middle trophic levels (Williams & Martinez, 2000). Our results suggest that the additional stress imposed by warming may represent an important tipping point for prey balancing the foraging-predation risk trade-off. In contrast, we saw no evidence that warming and risk created similar challenges for basal resources. Mussels can produce morphological defenses (thicker shells) in response to green crab risk cues (Leonard et al., 2000;Freeman et al., 2009), but these defenses were not accompanied by trade-offs in body mass. We did not detect risk or temperature effects on mussel quality, so differences in snail performance cannot be attributed to differences in the amount of energy available from mussels. M. edulis from Nahant are capable of surviving single 6 h exposures to air or water temperatures above 35\u00b0C, and up to 5 consecutive days of 6 h exposures to air or water temperatures near 30\u00b0C (Jones et al. 2009;Sorte et al. 2011) and it is clear that lethal limits for this species were not reached in our experiment because mussel survivorship and relative tissue mass were similar in both warmed and ambient treatments."}, {"section_title": "20", "text": "Finally, we observed no adverse effect of warming on green crab survivorship or feeding. Green crabs exhibit substantial ability to acclimate to warming temperatures and robust tolerance to water temperatures near 35\u00b0C (Tepolt & Somero, 2014). The broad thermal tolerance of green crabs is a common characteristic of many successful marine invaders (Sorte et al., 2013), which may explain their invasion success around the globe. The contrasting responses of three trophic levels to warming in our experiment highlights the need for more research that examines whether general patterns emerge regarding the impact of warming on different trophic levels (see Voigt et al., 2003;Freitas et al., 2007;Gauthier et al., 2013). Our experiment allowed us to assess the impacts of risk and warming on species interactions (prey foraging rates), individual performance (growth) and ecosystem function (growth efficiency). The independent effect of warming (\u03c9 2 = 0.21) on foraging was substantially less than that of risk (\u03c9 2 = 0.76), suggesting that, relative to predation risk, warming alone may have a comparatively minor role in driving predator-prey interactions. We also found that the negative effects of risk and warming on prey are trait-dependent (Fig. 3). For example, warming and risk caused reductions in growth and growth efficiency that exceeded their respective effects on foraging rates, suggesting that prey fitness and ecosystem function may be more sensitive than foraging to the combined effects of these stressors. Thus, the trait being considered will clearly shape our predictions on the impact of climate change. Because species interactions are fundamental to the organization and dynamics of natural communities, ecologists have recently emphasized the importance of examining how such interactions may be altered by climate change (Tylianakis et al., 2008;Gilman et al., 2010;Harley, 2011). Predator-prey interactions are ubiquitous in nature, and prey foraging under risk must balance the benefits of feeding with the costs of increased vulnerability to predators. Theory predicts that the calculus of feeding versus hiding by prey can be strongly shaped by their energetic status, which can be dictated by other factors such as competition, resource availability and abiotic stress (Luttbeg et al., 2003). As we have shown here, attention to the impacts of warming on the energetic status of individuals, in addition to species interaction strengths, will be essential to a more complete understanding of the impacts of climate change on natural systems.
