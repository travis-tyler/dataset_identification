However, the differences in supply were not associated with meaningful differences in child or family disease burden. There are geographic inequalities in the distribution of pediatric subspecialists in the United States [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] and Canada. 6 In the United States, 10% to 30% of children must travel .80 miles to access many pediatric subspecialists, including endocrinology, pulmonary, gastroenterology, nephrology, and developmental pediatrics. 7 One-quarter of children live .1 hour from the closest pediatric surgical subspecialist. 4 Pediatric subspecialty care is more limited in communities that are rural, poor, or in Western mountain states. 3 Increased training has not improved the maldistribution across the United States. 8 To address these inequalities in supply, there have been calls to change the training and recruitment of pediatric subspecialists. 2 Although inequalities in pediatric subspecialty supply are well documented, little is known about the impact of these inequalities on subspecialty utilization and child health. Children living in states with fewer pediatric subspecialists are more likely have more parent-reported unmet need for subspecialty care, 5 and decreased subspecialty access has also been associated with fewer discretionary subspecialty referrals. 9 Although these studies suggest that parent-and physician-perceived need for outpatient referral may be influenced by subspecialty supply, previous work has not evaluated the influence of local subspecialty supply on actual subspecialty utilization or child and family disease burden (such as missed school days or family financial burden). Given these uncertainties, the American Academy of Pediatrics has called for further research on the health consequences of the variation in pediatric subspecialty supply. 1, 10 To address this knowledge gap, we used nationally representative data to compare pediatric subspecialty utilization and disease burden among children with special health care needs (CSHCN) stratified by county pediatric subspecialty supply. We hypothesized that children in counties with lower subspecialty supply would have decreased subspecialty utilization and increased child and family disease burden.

Pediatric surgical specialist counts were not available in the Area Resource File and were not included. Pediatric mental health providers were not counted because they are excluded from the NS-CSHCN subspecialty utilization item. The county quotients of pediatric specialists per pediatric population were rank ordered, and counties were grouped into quintiles of pediatric subspecialty supply, such that each quintile contained \u223c20% of the US pediatric population. These 5 pediatric subspecialty supply quintiles (PSSQs) are subsequently referred to as highest, high, intermediate, low, and lowest PSSQ (lowest supply).\nWe recognize the limitations in physician supply data. [17] [18] [19] We used the Area Resource File to count pediatricfocused specialists such as pediatric neurologists and dermatologists in addition to American Board of Pediatricscertified pediatric subspecialists. Because of known imprecision in counting and locating physicians, [17] [18] [19] [20] we used quintiles of supply to examine relative supply rather than specific counts.\nAmong 40 242 NS-CSHCN respondents, county identifiers were missing for 2991 (7.4%).

Respondents with missing geographic data (0.3%) or missing covariate values in the multiple imputation files (0.2%) were also omitted from regression models.\nIn sensitivity analysis, we first examined CSHCN ,5 years old, because younger children might be less likely to be referred to adult subspecialists and therefore potentially be more sensitive to pediatric-specific subspecialty supply. Second, we examined 2 diseasespecific cohorts: children with asthma and children with migraines. These diagnoses were chosen because they were common and also allowed examination of additional disease-specific measures: \"difficulty with breathing\" and \"difficulty with pain,\" respectively. Of note, 80% of CSHCN with asthma and 91% of CSHCN with migraines reported additional chronic conditions. Third, we examined total subspecialty supply (pediatric and adult subspecialists) instead of PSSQ as an alternative measure of local subspecialty supply because adult subspecialists may also provide specialty care to children. Fourth, we used rural-urban status (using 2003 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes 29 ) instead of PSSQ as a measure of access on the basis of previous work associating rural-urban status with differences in access and acute care utilization.

In our adjusted results, compared with CSHCN in the highest PSSQ, CSHCN in the lowest PSSQ were 5.3% less likely to perceive need for subspecialty care and 4.8% less likely to see a subspecialist. Our findings are consistent with similarly decreased perceived need for subspecialty care among CSHCN in rural compared with urban areas, 22 although previous work examining subspecialty utilization by rural-urban status has shown mixed results. 23, 37 Despite these differences in perceived need and utilization, we observed no large differences in child or family disease burden. Given that there are no pediatric subspecialists in most of the lowest PSSQ counties, our results suggest that many children travel outside of their county for subspecialty care, but surprisingly, families in the lowest PSSQ did not report more financial burden and were less likely to report impact on work. Overall, our study reveals a small decrease in subspecialty utilization in areas with decreased pediatric subspecialty supply, which is paralleled by decreased perceived need. The lack of substantial associated child or family disease burden raises questions about the clinical relevance of these differences.\nThere are several potential interpretations for our finding of increased perceived need and utilization in the areas of highest subspecialty supply in the absence of a substantial impact on child or family disease burden. One explanation could be supplier-induced demand, where increased subspecialty supply generates demand in excess of actual need. 38, 39 The lack of differences in disease burden may indicate that Values are adjusted percentages among the weighted CSHCN population, obtained using the method of predictive margins. Our logistic regression models adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, insurance, poverty, parent education, primary language, other household children, chronic medical conditions, mental health condition, having usual provider and usual source of care, receiving care coordination, and receiving preventive care. NS, not significant (P . .05). children' s actual medical needs are being met to a similar degree across all regions, and that increased utilization in areas of highest supply represents unnecessary overutilization. Another related explanation is that the scope of practice for general pediatricians may vary with accessibility of subspecialty care. Previous work has estimated that as many as 40% of specialty visits could be managed in primary care, 40 that generalists are more willing to comanage chronic illnesses than subspecialists recognize, 41, 42 and that general pediatricians with lower subspecialty access report greater comfort addressing subspecialty care needs. 43 These findings support the possibility that different generalist scope of practice due to different subspecialty supply could account for the small observed difference in utilization without adversely impacting disease burden.\nAt the population level, our results do not identify clinically significant amounts of foregone subspecialty care in lower supply areas. However, it is worth noting that we examined a heterogeneous group of children with varying medical conditions and needs. Although we did not observe a clinical effect across the entire population, some children within this population may still benefit from increased access to subspecialty care. For example, we did observe a 2.3% increase in ED visits among CSHCN in the lowest supply quintile, which hints that there may be subpopulations for which decreased access is associated with foregone care, unmet need, and adverse health consequences. Our sensitivity analyses focusing on children with asthma and migraines were consistent with overall findings. However, these analyses were limited due to the large number of children with multiple chronic diagnoses and the lack of subspecialty-specificutilizationordiseasespecific outcomes. Future work examining disease-specific utilization and outcomes among children with specific diagnoses 17 or health needs 44 may be valuable in identifying consequences of variation in subspecialty access that are not apparent in our current analysis.\nAlthough unmet need and disease burden were similar regardless of local subspecialty supply, the primary barriers to subspecialty care did differ by local subspecialty supply. Specifically, parents reporting unmet need for subspecialty care in areas with low supply most often reported geographic and transportation barriers, whereas those with unmet need in areas with high supply most often reported financial and scheduling barriers. Across all areas, then, opportunities exist to improve the systems through which CSHCN access subspecialty care by addressing geographic, scheduling, and financial barriers. Technology-based interventions such as Internet triage systems, 45 telephone consultations systems, 46 and telemedicine 47, 48 offer opportunities not only to deliver subspecialty care across"}, {"section_title": "FIGURE 1", "text": "Adjusted risk differences among children with special health care needs during the previous year by PSSQ for subspecialty utilization, need, and unmet need (A); child disease burden (B); and family disease burden (C).

Additionally, educational efforts to build generalists' capacity for common subspecialty referrals may also shift referral thresholds, reduce demand on subspecialists, and increase appointment availability. 49 Given our finding that unmet need for subspecialty care was similar across all PSSQs, further exploration of multifaceted approaches to improving the generalistsubspecialist interface appear to be indicated, rather than focusing specifically on local supply differences."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "The NS-CSHCN is a cross-sectional, parent-reported survey, which limits our ability to determine causality and raises the potential for parent recall biases. Our measure of supply included multiple pediatric subspecialists, and our measure of utilization counted any subspecialist rather than disease-specific subspecialists. We did not have data on additional factors that could moderate the effective local subspecialty supply, such as outreach/satellite clinics or telemedicine availability. Additionally, limitations exist generally in the measurement of subspecialty supply, [17] [18] [19] [20] prompting us to examine relative density of providers rather than specific numerical counts. We examined countylevel supply because no standardized market area exists for ambulatory pediatric subspecialty care. Also, we focused on any subspecialty utilization rather than quantity, quality, or timeliness of use. These more sensitive measures of utilization might identify greater differences in utilization across quintiles but would still be coupled with the same minimal differences in disease burden measures. Also, our study population included CSHCN with multiple chronic diagnoses and varied medical needs; although we attempted to examine more homogeneous cohorts in subanalyses of children with asthma and migraines, .80% of both of these cohorts had $1 additional diagnosis. Focusing on children with specific diagnoses 17 or medical needs 44 may be valuable in future studies. Within such disease-specific analyses, examination of objective disease-specific outcomes would be valuable, which was limited in our analysis due to lack of available data and reliance on parent report. Additionally, we examined utilization, need, and disease burden within the past year; it is worth considering that pediatric subspecialty supply may have a greater impact on more long-term outcomes. Finally, it is important to note that our study examined ambulatory utilization and potentially ambulatory care-sensitive measures of disease burden and does not pertain to the impact of access to subspecialty care among hospitalized children."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Large differences exist in pediatric subspecialty supply across the United States.

The chickens had free range of the yard and large area in the back of the barn. While we usually ate the eggs, during peak production we would sometimes bring a few dozen eggs each week to sell at the local market. At that time, we did not have to label how much space they had to roam. As reported in The New York Times (Business: March 3, 2014), times have clearly changed. In 2008, Californians voted to impose new standards for hen housing. The standards, which go into effect Jan 1, 2015, require 116 square inches of space for each bird. The industry standard, however, is 67 square inches. That would not be a huge issue except that the California Legislature also required eggs imported from other states to be produced under the California standards. That has producers in other states crying foul. While some egg producers are supportive of the California initiative as it supports animal welfare, others feel strongly that Californians are unduly restricting free trade and agricultural practices. The issue has spilled over into the courts. The attorney general of at least one state has filed a lawsuit to block the California egg rules, and attorney generals from three other states are contemplating joining the lawsuit. Some suspect that the case will go all the way to the Supreme Court. Until that happens, California egg producers have been busy building bigger cages. While fewer chickens are in each enclosure and those chickens tend to eat more, fewer of the chickens die and they are more productive so the overall cost to upgrade the housing is predicted to be quite low.
