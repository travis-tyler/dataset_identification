[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The COVID-19 epidemic is a major threat to both public health and global economy. To minimize death toll and economic loss, countries worldwide have assumed various strategies (not always officially declared). Two main strategies to counteract the epidemic spread are eradication and suppression. Countries such as China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, New Zealand, Australia, and others, decided to fully eradicate the disease on their territories and then limit and control incoming travelers. Geographic isolation helps to implement such strategy. Most European countries have chosen the suppression strategy that aims to limit the exponential growth of the outbreak and then reduce daily new cases to a small number. Both the eradication and the suppression strategy are founded on the expectation that a vaccine will be developed in near future, and that massive vaccination will ultimately enable governments to lift imposed restrictions. A third strategy, in which it is anticipated that, on the contrary, no effective vaccine will be available soon and thus long-term containment is not realistic, is to rely on mitigation and ultimately acquisition of herd immunity. This strategy had been initially declared in the UK but was promptly abandoned due to a rapid increase in the death toll and the threat of overwhelming the health system.\nIn the conceptual framework of mathematical models of infectious diseases, any policy that aims at reducing transmission of the virus seeks to decrease the effective reproduction number R(t) (sometimes denoted R t ), which within S(E)IR-type epidemic models [1] is equal to the ratio of the contact rate\u02dbof the infectious and susceptible individuals and removal rate \u201a of the infectious individuals, R =\u02db/\u201a. In terms of policy-making, the contact rate\u02dbcan be reduced by prohibition of mass gatherings that increase the risk of super-spreading events, social distancing, and hygienic precautions, which decrease the risk that a given contact is infectious, and by quarantine in which the individuals are forced to stay home or at least significantly limit their out-of-home activity. The removal rate \u201a can be increased by enhanced testing and contact tracing, which both enable prompt isolation of (potentially) infectious individuals. While a nation-wide quarantine (lockdown) is an effective mean of reducing\u02db (and R) and saving lives, it hampers economic activity and may thus incur a significant loss of country GDP, in addition to psychological and social costs. In individual countries the policy-making is thus intuitively understood as a balancing act between health and fiscal risks of the pandemic.\n2 .

As the cumulative deaths per capita and cumulative lockdown are the two quantities that have to be jointly minimized, we constructed Pareto fronts that help to evaluate the European suppression and Australasian eradication policies and, as such, provide a reference for the assessment of policies applied in the United States and other countries of the Americas. We show that there is a strong correlation between cumulative deaths per capita and cumulative lockdown, and interpret this result by dissecting the impact of testing and nation-wide quarantine on the effective reproduction number."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Severity of national lockdowns can be inferred from data on the reduction of mobility gathered in Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports [2] . We expect that the relative reduction of mobility in locations belonging to two categories-workplaces and places related to retail and recreation-is strongly associated with economic slowdown. We thus assume that the cumulative average mobility reduction in these two categories serves as a good indicator of the impact the epidemic has on economy. In Fig. 1 we plotted national trajectories of cumulative mobility reduction vs. deaths per million inhabitants (the latter on the logarithmic scale) for Western, Central, and South European countries that have populations of at least four million. These countries nearly unanimously adopted the suppression strategy. We also marked present-day data points for several Australasian countries that adopted the eradication strategy.\nThe current Pareto-optimal front (darkest gray dotted line) is spanned by Slovakia, Bulgaria, and three Scandinavian countries: Norway, Denmark, and Sweden. The countries that have the smallest number of reported deaths per capita are two non-Western European countries, Slovakia (5/million) and Bulgaria (26/million). The Scandinavian countries have higher death tolls (ranging from 45/million for Norway to 483/million for Sweden) but lower cumulative lockdown. Since we consider cumulative values, over time the Pareto-optimal front moves away from the origin of the coordinate system (in Fig. 1 , adjacent dotted gray lines indicate front positions in two-week intervals) and countries forming the front may change.

In the countries that are close to the current Pareto-pessimal front, the epidemic had three distinguishable phases, depicted schematically in Fig. 3 . In the initial phase, characterized by a high R value and no mobility reduction, R decreases due to suppression of super-spreading events and social distancing. In the next phase, R drops below 1 due to the reduction of mobility, which leads to a decrease of the contact rate\u02db. When analyzing individual trajectories plotted in Fig. 2 we may notice that in the second phase the number of tests per case (indicated by line width and color intensity) remains constant or decreases (possibly due to saturation of the capacity of facilities that perform tests), suggesting that in this phase the removal rate \u201a remains constant or decreases. This confirms that the reduction of mobility, and thus\u02db, was instrumental in bringing R below 1. We digress here to note that the daily number of performed tests can be referred either to the population size or to the number of positive cases (positive tests). We think that this latter scaling is more adequate as it reflects the idea of contact tracing, when the individuals that had contact with an infected individual undergo testing. The bigger is the tested cluster of individuals, the higher is the probability that majority of the secondary infectious will be identified and \"removed\". Therefore we assume that \u201a grows monotonically with the number of 'tests per case'. Another measure related to 'tests per case' and \u201a is the ratio of the delayed daily new cases to daily new deaths. A large number of 'cases per death' indicates that a large fraction of infected individuals have been identified (and isolated), and thus implies large \u201a.\n6 .

Indeed, when R is kept below 1, there is epidemic regression, during which the number of daily new cases is steadily decreasing, which leads to an increase of the average number of tests per case as can be seen for nearly all countries in Fig. 2 . As a consequence, a given value of mobility reduction (and, thus, of\u02db) corresponds to two values of R: higher than 1 in the second phase (when \u201a is low) and lower than 1 in the third phase (when \u201a is high).\nAn essentially similar three-phase dynamics can be seen also when R is calculated from the number of daily registered deaths (not cases; see Methods). In Supplementary Figure S1 we show that the number of the delayed cases per death is higher in the third than in the second phase, indicating that a larger fraction of cases is detected in the epidemic regression phase.\nConsidered countries that introduced restrictions when the number of daily cases was relatively small were able to perform a higher number of tests per case and thus achieved higher \u201a. This allowed them to reduce R below 1 at larger\u02dbvalues, that is, at smaller mobility reduction (see Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figure S1 ). This explains a positive correlation between the death toll and cumulative lockdown (visible in Fig. 1 ), implying that, when the epidemic eradication or suppression is the objective, there is no trade-off between public health and economic loss.\nUp-to-date analysis shows that in most European countries the lockdown, even when introduced with some delay, allowed to bring R below 1 and proved to be an effective strategy to suppress the spread of the epidemic. However, when larger Latin American countries and the most populated states of USA are considered, the current picture is different. As shown in This may be attributed to a considerable difference in the number of tests per case with respect to European countries. Much less extensive (and sometimes even dwindling) testing coverage leads to smaller \u201a, which at comparable mobility reduction yields larger R. Due to economic and societal pressures, many Latin American countries are currently perilously decreasing mobility restrictions while having R > 1.\nAmong the considered American countries, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia achieved the highest cumulative lockdowns (see Fig. 5 ). Only Peru managed to reduce R below 1; however, since 7 .

Trajectories presented in Fig. 4 suggest that the administrative suppression strategy may fail at least in some Latin American countries.\nIn the United States, only in the New York State and in Illinois-that are among top 10 most populated states and were most severely affected by the epidemic-current R remains below 1. In the remaining eight states, R \u2265 1, while mobility restrictions are gradually lifted (Fig. 4) .\nAs the number of daily new cases is increasing, improved testing efficient and reduction of R by increasing \u201a becomes difficult. Trajectories of American countries and states of the USA plotted in the cumulative deaths vs. cumulative lockdown plane (see Fig. 5 ) indicate that the most devastating may be the changing of the strategy. All considered American countries 8 .

However, since the outbreak of the epidemic in the Americas has been delayed with respect to Europe, it is too early to evaluate strategies or scenarios in these countries.\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 29, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.27.20141747 doi: medRxiv preprint and Bulgaria (with coordinates of Poland and Czechia lying nearby), and three Scandinavian countries: Norway, Denmark and Sweden. Without some additional criteria weighting the number of deaths and the severity of lockdown one may not compare countries on a Pareto front. The Pareto-pessimal front in Europe is much shorter than the Pareto-optimal front. Countries forming this front or lying close to it encountered first a lot of deaths due to the delayed lockdown decision and then had a long and strict lockdown that was introduced to stop the spread of the epidemic.\nWe showed that when the number of daily new cases exceeds some threshold, the further epidemic growth can be suppressed only by strict quarantine. In the growth phase, the number of tests per case decreases, implying reduction of the removal rate \u201a. This in turn implies that the reproduction number R =\u02db/\u201a is decreased only due to quarantine that reduced the contact rate\u02db. Only after the imposed quarantine reduced R below 1 can the epidemic be further suppressed by the increased efficiency of testing (number of test per case), increasing the removal rate \u201a. The increase of \u201a allows for curbing the number of daily new cases (and resulting deaths) at gradual relaxation of lockdown measures.\nOur analysis shows that in Latin American countries that perform a relatively small number of tests and thus have small removal rate \u201a, reduction of the contact rate\u02dbthrough national quarantine turned out to be insufficient to reduce R below 1. In the United States significant suppression of the epidemic seems to be within technological reach, as in all ten most populated states the lockdown had reduced R below 1, however subsequent increase of mobility caused that R returned above 1 in eight of these states. As the number of daily new cases is growing, it becomes increasing difficult to boost the removal rate \u201a by enhanced testing, thus the only option to reduce R below 1 is to restore lockdown (which seems politically unrealistic in the USA). One may thus anticipate that these countries will inevitably realize the herd immunity-based scenario of epidemic dynamics, in which the administratively imposed restrictions are replaced by voluntary risk-avoiding and risk-adapting strategies of the individuals [3] .\nSuch scenario appears to be currently taking place in Sweden. In such a case the preceding transient lockdown may be not beneficial as it adds economic cost to the unavoidable death toll.\nOver time, countries may leave and (re)appear on the Pareto front.

In a bit longer perspective, the countries currently having R > 1 are in the worst situation as their number of daily new cases is still increasing. In a longer time scale, both the cumulated death toll and the country-specific history of lockdown accumulation (lockdown fatigue) should be taken into consideration when predicting plausible further country trajectory as these two factors influence risk avoidance and risk acceptance, respectively. Countries that managed to prevent a high death toll by early and effective lockdown may find themselves in a psychologically more challenging situation as they will face lockdown fatigue that will not be counterbalanced be the \"cumulated fear\".\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 29, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.27.20141747 doi: medRxiv preprint above the expected number of deaths when the officially recorded COVID-19 fatalities are subtracted from the total number of deaths (for example, in Italy, between 24 February and 26 April, there were nearly 43,000 more deaths than would be expected for this period with only about 60% of these deaths attributed to COVID-19 [7] ).\nTesting density is analyzed according to: \n, where x i is rolling mean of the respective daily new counts (calculated within a 14-day window with equal weights) and the time span is set to w = 14 days. Let us notice that T d is positive when the number of daily cases (or deaths) is increasing, and T d is negative when the number of daily cases is decreasing; when the number of daily cases remains constant in time, then T d = \u221e. The reproduction number R on i-th day was then computed in accordance with Wallinga and Lipsitch [8] and Wearing, Rohani, and Keeling [9] as:\nassuming m = 6, n = 1, ff = 1/(5.28 days), \u201a = 1/(3 days). These parameter values reflect the assumption that the incubation period is Erlang-distributed with the shape parameter 6 and mean of 5.28 days [10] , while the period of infectiousness is distributed exponentially with the mean of 3 days [11] .
