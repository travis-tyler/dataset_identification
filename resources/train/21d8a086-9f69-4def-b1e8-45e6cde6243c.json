DESIGN: Longitudinal analysis. SETTING: Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 65 and older (287 men, 258 women) with 2 to 10 years of follow-up. MEASUREMENTS: Weakness was determined according to handgrip strength using a hand dynamometer, appendicular lean mass (ALM) using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and walking speed according to 6-m usual pace walk speed. Analyses were performed using classification and regression tree analysis, Cohen's kappa, and Cox models. RESULTS: Cutpoints derived from Weak I for ALM (ALM I ) were less than 21.4 kg in men and less than 14.1 kg in women and for ALM adjusted for body mass index (ALM/BMI I ) were less than 0.725 in men and less than 0.591 in women. Kappas with EWGSOP were 0.65 for men and 0.75 for women for ALM I and 0.34 for men and 0.47 for women for ALM/BMI I . Men with Weak I + ALM I were twice as likely to develop slow walking as those not weak with normal ALM I (Hazard ratio (HR) = 2.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-5.82). Under EWGSOP, men with weakness and low RALM were almost 3 times as likely to develop slow walking as those not weak with normal RALM (HR = 2.91, 95% CI = 1.11-7.62). Neither approach predicted incident slow walking in women. CONCLUSION: The ALM I cutpoints agree with EWG-SOP and predict slow walking in men. Future studies should explore sex differences in the relationship between body composition and physical function and the effect of change in muscle mass on muscle strength and physical function.

Multiple research groups, including the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) and the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) Sarcopenia Project, have developed definitions and criteria for sarcopenia. Although the measures of muscle mass and muscle strength overlap, the cutpoints differ. Recent comparisons of definitions have shown low levels of agreement, limiting the ability to apply these criteria to research studies and clinical care. [1] [2] [3] The classic definition of sarcopenia was based on low lean mass, because mass itself was assumed to strongly affect muscle function. 4 More recently, age-related strength decline has been shown to exceed lean mass decline and to correlate more strongly with poor lower extremity function. 5, 6 Thus, contemporary definitions of sarcopenia include muscle mass and strength. The EWGSOP first used this approach to recommended that sarcopenia definitions include low lean mass and low muscle function and defined function as strength or performance. 6 They proposed three stages of sarcopenia; presarcopenia is low lean mass without low muscle function, sarcopenia is low lean mass with low muscle strength or low performance, and severe sarcopenia is low muscle mass with low muscle strength and low performance. Grip strength cutpoints for EWGSOP were less than 30 kg for men and less than 20 kg for women. 6 The mass cutpoints were derived from a population distribution, similar to the classic definition, with an appendicular lean mass (ALM) adjusted for height (RALM) less than 2 standard deviations below the sex-specific means of young reference groups (men: 7.26 kg/m 2 , women: 5.50 kg/m 2 ).\nGiven the varying definitions of the term \"sarcopenia,\" the FNIH Sarcopenia Project avoided it, and proposed cutpoints for \"clinically meaningful\" low muscle strength (weakness) and low lean mass based on their ability to predict slow walking speed (<0.8 m/s) and weakness, respectively. 5 The Project team suggested that these cutpoints could provide a \"differential diagnosis,\" distinguishing muscle weakness as a result of low muscle mass from muscle weakness due to other causes or even low lean mass in the absence of weakness. The cutpoints for low lean mass and weakness were empirically determined using pooled data from several data sets and were intended to be very conservative, with high specificity and low false positive rates.\nThe FNIH cutpoints were developed through recursive partitioning, a method that splits data into mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive groups. The FNIH weakness cutpoint was based on the group with the lowest cutpoint for grip strength predictive of slow walking speed, and the cutpoint for low mass was based on the group with the lowest cutpoint for muscle mass predictive of weakness. 5 The recursive partitioning approach also yielded an intermediate cutpoint for weakness 7 (Weak I ), but no intermediate cutpoints for low lean mass were derived. It is likely that less-stringent cutpoints for low lean mass and weakness would have led to a higher prevalence and better agreement with other criteria. The FNIH studies suggested that adjustment for body mass index (BMI) might be an important factor in determining the relationship between mass, strength, and function, so new cutpoints would need to be assessed with and without BMI adjustment.\nThe original FNIH cutpoints for weakness and low lean mass showed poor agreement with the EWGSOP and yielded lower prevalence rates. 3 Thus, it was expected that the new lean mass cutpoints, derived from and used in conjunction with the less-conservative FNIH weakness cutpoint, would lead to better agreement with EWGSOP and yield more-similar prevalence estimates.\nThis study developed new cutpoints for appendicular lean mass (ALM), with and without BMI adjustment, based on the reported less-conservative FNIH strength cutpoints using data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). Agreement with the EWGSOP definition and ability to predict incident slow walking and mortality were assessed."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Sample", "text": "The BLSA is an observational, longitudinal study of normative aging established in 1958 and currently administered by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute on Aging.

Slow walking was determined from the average of two trials of usual 6-m gait speed. Participants unable to attend a clinic visit had gait speed assessed in the home.

Within each classification, participants were subclassified as being not weak with normal lean mass, not weak with low lean mass, weak with normal lean mass, or weak with low lean mass. Derivation of ALM I and ALM/BMI I is described below."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analyses", "text": "Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC). All analyses were stratified according to sex. Descriptive statistics for participant characteristics were based on the index visit. Similar to a previous study, classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was used to derive appropriate ALM I and ALM/BMI I cutpoints for the study sample. 9 Recursive partitioning was performed using R software version 3.1.2 with the rpart package (R-Project for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). ALM and ALM/BMI were individually used in CART models to predict FNIH Weak I (31.83 kg for men, 19.99 kg for women). To prevent overfitting, the tree was pruned by minimizing cross-validation error using internal leave 10% out cross-validation, wherein the data were divided into 10 mutually exclusive data sets, with each set excluding 10% of the original sample and classification error repeatedly estimated within the remaining 90% of the data (leaving out a different 10% each time). The final model was selected as the most-parsimonious model, with a cross-validated classification error within 1 standard deviation of the minimum classification error.\nTo compare the FNIH and EWGSOP classifications, positive percent agreement (PPA, analogous to sensitivity) and negative percent agreement (NPA analogous to specificity) were calculated, with EWGSOP treated as the criterion standard, as well as Cohen's kappa statistics, as in previous FNIH analyses. 3 For these cross-sectional comparisons, weakness and low lean mass were classified at a participant's most-recent visit.\nCox proportional hazards models were fit to assess risk of developing incident slow walking over time according to each sarcopenia subclass, separately for men and women. Sarcopenia was modeled as a time-varying covariate, which involved updating sarcopenia status at each assessment. 10 For these analyses, sarcopenia status was modeled to predict incident slow walking at the subsequent visit. Initial models were unadjusted, followed by an adjustment for age at baseline. No additional confounders were included, to be comparable with published analyses. 11 The same analyses were used to predict mortality."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "The characteristics of the study population are presented in Table 1 . Mean follow-up was 5.7 AE 2.2 years for men and 5.6 AE 2.2 years for women; 8.5% of men and 3.9% of women died over the follow-up period. Based on the reported FNIH less-conservative grip strength cutpoints of 31.83 for men and 19.99 for women, the cutpoints derived from CART analyses for ALM I were 21.38 kg for men and 14.12 kg for women, and the ALM/ BMI I cutpoints were 0.725 m 2 for men and 0.591 m 2 for women.\nPrevalence of each weakness and low lean mass definition are also shown in Table 1 . For men, the prevalence of weakness using the new FNIH cutpoint was higher than when using EWGSOP. Prevalence of low lean mass was least by ALM/BMI I and greatest by ALM I . The subclass \"weak with low lean mass\" was most prevalent according to the FNIH Weak I + ALM I classification and least prevalent according to the FNIH Weak I + ALM/BMI I classification.\nIn women, the prevalence of weakness was similar in EWGSOP and FNIH Weak I, , and the prevalence of low ALM/BMI I was higher than low RALM and ALM I . The highest prevalence of \"weak with low lean mass\" was observed with the FNIH Weak I + ALM/BMI I classification and lowest for EWGSOP.\nAgreement improved using the new FNIH cutpoints. For men, the incidence of slow walking is displayed according to sarcopenia definition and group in Table 2 , along with the risk of slow walking of each group. Using the FNIH Weak I and ALM I definition, those who were not weak with low lean mass, weak with normal lean mass, and weak with low lean mass had a higher incidence of slow walking. After age adjustment, the weak with low lean mass group still had a higher incidence of slow walking. In unadjusted and adjusted analyses for ALM/BMI I , only weak men with normal lean mass had a higher incidence of slow walking than men with normal strength and mass. Using the EWGSOP definition in unadjusted analyses in men, all subgroups had a higher incidence rate of slow walking than the normal group. After age adjustment, the not weak and low lean mass group and the weak with low lean mass group had higher incident slow walking over time.\nResults in women are shown in Table 3 . Using the FNIH Weak I and ALM/BMI I definition, only those with weakness and low lean mass had a higher incidence of slow walking than the normal group, which became nonsignificant after age adjustment. Weakness with normal lean mass was associated with a lower incidence of slow walking after age adjustment. No associations were observed using the EWGSOP cutpoints.\nTables S1 and S2 describe incident mortality per 100 person-years and the risk of mortality in men and women. Neither the FNIH intermediate definitions nor EWGSOP was associated with mortality in unadjusted or adjusted models."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "New lean mass cutpoints were derived based on previously described, less-conservative, intermediate FNIH Weak I cutpoints. 7 The FNIH intermediate definitions showed stronger agreement with EWGSOP than the original weakness and low lean mass cutpoints and better agreement without BMI adjustment. 3 Both intermediate cutpoints (with and without BMI adjustment) and the EWGSOP predicted incident slow walking in men but not women.\nGreater uniformity of definitions would facilitate recognition and treatment of sarcopenia. [1] [2] [3] Several reports have compared definitions of sarcopenia and found varying prevalence ranges [1] [2] [3] and poor agreement. 3, 12 Comparisons of EWGSOP and the original FNIH reported prevalence of 1.6% to 20.4% in men and 2.5% to 26.2% in women. 2 Comparing definitions using mass or grip separately also resulted in broad prevalence ranges (0-45.2% in men, 0-25.8% in women). 1 Improving agreement of definitions may help increase applicability for clinical care and research. The very conservative values for the FNIH definition contribute to the low agreement with other definitions. The lessconservative intermediate weakness and resultant lean mass cutpoints described here help improve agreement and may indicate that the FNIH intermediate and EWGSOP identify a mild to moderate degree of sarcopenia, whereas the original FNIH definition identifies those with severe sarcopenia.\nFor clinical application, it is important to understand fully how sarcopenia definitions differentially distinguish older adults. A longitudinal analysis in men that compared several definitions of sarcopenia and their predictive and discriminative ability for multiple clinical outcomes found that sarcopenia by many of the definitions, including the FNIH and EWGSOP, was associated with greater risk of clinical outcomes 13 , although sarcopenia did not discriminate better than age alone. To meet its intended purpose, definitions of sarcopenia should distinguish this geriatric syndrome from declines of normal aging.\nWhereas the intermediate definitions of weakness and resultant low lean mass seem suitable for assessment in men, the current study results showed no associations with higher incidence of slow walking in women. Weakness with normal lean mass, after adjusting for age, trended in the direction of lower incidence of slow walking with each definition, even reaching significance in the FNIH Weak I and ALM/BMI I definition. In the original FNIH Sarcopenia Project pooled cohort, weakness, regardless of low lean mass, was associated with greater odds of future slow walking than being not weak with normal lean mass in men. 11 In women, being weak or having low lean mass was associated with greater odds of future slow walking than being not weak with normal lean mass.\n11 These differences in association may be due to sample differences. The BLSA women were younger at baseline than the original FNIH pooled cohort 11 (mean age 73.1 vs 76.5) and had higher mean grip strength (23.6 vs 22.1 kg). The BLSA men at baseline were comparable with the FNIH pooled cohort in age (mean 74.4 vs 74.0), and BLSA men had lower mean grip strength at baseline (38.1 vs 41.3 kg), both of which may explain why associations were found with incidence of slow walking in men but not women. Additionally, the Weak I cutpoint may be too liberal for women in the BLSA because of the above-mentioned differences, which may explain why FNIH Weak I and ALM/BMI I was associated with lower incidence of slow walking.\nThe strengths of this study include multiple assessments of muscle mass, strength, and walking speed over time and inclusion of data on walking speed from home assessments. The time-varying analysis also allowed for change in status over time. The primary limitation was the relatively good health of BLSA participants, who had a lower incidence of slow walking and mortality than other cohorts. Lower outcome rates coupled with a smaller sample size may have limited power to observe expected associations.\nThese results indicate that using the less-conservative FNIH weakness cutpoints improves agreement while still identifying men at risk of future slow walking, although care should be taken in using the lean mass cutpoints derived from the BLSA in other cohorts. The ALM I cutpoint derived in women and the ALM/BMI I cutpoint derived in men in this sample are lower than those derived in the original FNIH study (ALM I : 14.12 vs 15.02 kg, ALM/BMI I : 0.725 vs 0.789 m 2 ). These lower cutpoints may also be the result of sample differences, as described earlier. When comparing baseline gait speed in BLSA participants with that of the original FNIH sarcopenia project cohort, there is a lower prevalence of gait speed of 1.0 m/s or less in BLSA men (21.2% vs 28.7%) and women (32.1% vs 66.5%). This may explain why lower lean mass cutpoints were necessary to identify participants at risk of slowness in the BLSA than in other cohorts.\nConceptually, sarcopenia is an important state, but challenges with operational definitions remain. Future research should focus beyond between-person effects to the trajectory and timeline of loss of muscle mass and strength and the effect of muscle quality. Future work should also address the causes of the strikingly different relationships between mass, strength, and future function in men and women.
