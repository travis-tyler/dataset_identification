I am extremely thankful for the opportunity he gave me in 2007 to begin work as an undergraduate in his Soil and Water Geospatial Analysis Laboratory (SAWGAL). At the time I had no field experience and little education in environmental science, I just knew I loved the outdoors. Since that time I have developed into a confident, well-educated scientist who has found the joy of research and gotten to know a thing or two about the world around him. I look forward to many years of learning ahead in the field of environmental science and realize that it is due in no small part to my years spent working for you at SAWGAL. I would also like to thank all of the wonderful people I have had the opportunity to meet and work with in the SAWGAL lab throughout my years at the University of Maryland. At the top of this list would be my coworker and friend Wesley Bickford. Fieldwork was a large part of this study and the majority of it was carried out by Wes and I, often in less than ideal conditions (this was a winter burn study in a tidal marsh, after all). I believe we developed a good chemistry and working relationship which would have made this study all but impossible to carry out if it had not been present. Additionally, I would like to thank Amanda Garzio-Hadzick who managed SAWGAL and kept everything in order from the summer of 2009 through the summer of 2010. Miriam Myers and Emily Hutchins were great help in the field and the lab for this study, and have been great to work with over the past 4 years as well. I would like to thank the Maryland Sea Grant for project funding for this study. The logistical support necessary for completion of this study would not have been possible without the help of Fish and Wildlife Service staff members located at the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, specifically Matt Whitbeck, Bill Giese, Leticia Melendez, Nate Carle, and Suzanne Baird. The FWS staff was always helpful when we needed a boat, field hands, or overnight lodging. Patrick J. Megonigal and his staff at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center provided field and lab help with porewater sampling and analysis, and also with the initial experimental design of this project, and I thank him for this. A special thanks goes out to Dennis Skultety at the Illinois Natural History Survey for help in making the GIS maps for this paper. I would also like to thank Donald Cahoon and Jim Lynch of the USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center for collaborating and sharing data and methods used for the planning and implementation of this study. Finally, I would like to thank my close friends and family for their loving support over the past few years. Without the care and companionship of people like my Mother and Father, Sister and Brother, Sean Schnably, Shawn Pillai, Eric Boyd, Matthew Finger, John Hughes, Josh Pratt, Derrick Swandol, and Clinton Gill the workload and stress from this project would have certainly gotten the best of me. They will never know how important their contribution to this end product was. I have truly been blessed to have each of these people and organizations present in my life. Each of them has contributed more to my professional development and development as a person more than can be written in a couple of pages. The end product of this thesis is just as much theirs as it is mine. My sincerest thanks go out to each and every one of them."}, {"section_title": "LIST OF TABLES", "text": "Page # Chapter Table 1-1: Summary chart detailing nutrient additions and plant responses in coastal marshes ..................................................................................................................................

The focus will generally be on the Mid-Atlantic region of the USA, with a special focus on the study site at Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. Blackwater NWR, located in Dorchester County on the lower Eastern Shore of Maryland (38\u00b027'N, 76\u00b007'W) is over 27,000 acres in size and consists mostly of microtidal brackish marshes characterized by fluctuating water levels and salinities. The refuge is part of and managed by the U. S. Fish \nFire is a natural component of wetland ecosystems . Historically, prescribed fire has been used to remove vegetation to facilitate seasonal hunting and trapping in marsh ecosystems . In East Coast marshes, fire is used to facilitate the trapping of muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) by making their lodges more visible to hunters . Furthermore, prescribed fire is an effective method in reducing the risk of unpredictable and/or uncontrollable wildfire which pose serious risks to property owner and the public Mitchel et al., 2006;). Prescribed fire has recently become an integral part of resource management in coastal wetlands and is widely accepted as an effective technique to promote the growth of favorable wetland vegetation on the East and Gulf coast . While the general effects of prescribed burning are known, the mechanisms of ecosystem plant-soil dynamics following burns have not been thoroughly studied. Fire represents an important role in nutrient cycling within ecosystems, directly or indirectly influencing many ecosystem properties, and has been understudied in wetlands Schmalzer and Hinkle, 1992;). Nutrients contained in surface vegetation are redistributed through particulate (ash) and nonparticulate (volatilization) pathways following fire . Particulate material can be redistributed from a burn site to adjacent areas through wind, rainfall, erosion, runoff, and leaching, or can remain onsite and may have a significant impact on the soil nutrient status and water quality . Increased post-fire nutrient concentrations in soil and nearby waters have been observed in numerous studies (Schmalzer and Hinkle, 1992;. Nutrients with relatively low volatilization temperatures, such as carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur, may be removed from the burn site through volatilization and result in atmospheric pollution ). Removal of standing vegetation stock may also affect site microclimate and there may alter microbial activity and the forms and amounts of nutrients by affecting soil temperature (Schmalzer and Hinkle, 1992). The effects of fire on nutrient availability in coastal marshes are not well understood, although it may have significant implications to managing these threatened ecosystems. Organic matter dynamics following prescribed fire events is poorly understood. Fire removes important plant biomass material from the marsh system, leading to a mineralization and volatilization of nutrients, which may or may not affect plant productivity and marsh accretion rates ). However, burning may stimulate plant biomass production so that the net effect of is an increase in organic matter, lower organic matter decomposition rates, and associated increases in marsh elevation (Schmalzer and Hinkle, 1992;. Stimulation of belowground production has been observed following prescribed burning in coastal marshes and may play a key role in marsh accretion (Pendelton and Stevenson, 1983). Studies have shown burned marsh areas recovered elevation faster following a peat collapse and was attributed to an increase in soil organic matter volume . Thus, the overall effect of burning has not been well studied but is suspected to increase organic matter volume. The effect of short term goals such as favorable vegetative species growth and fuel load management on long term coastal marsh sustainability has not been investigated at length . Coastal marshes must accrete vertically to maintain existence in the intertidal zone or they will be lost to open water . Thus, the repeated removal of plant litter burning could lead to decreased vertical accretion and sediment elevation (Gabrey and Aftron, 2001). While plant production may increase after burning, it is unknown whether burned marshes export or accumulate the same amount of organic matter as unburned marshes . Processes directly involving organic matter dynamics, such as decomposition, are important to understand as they may respond positively or negatively to this management practice . Increased organic matter decomposition may lead to elevation loss from these ecosystems, hindering their ability to keep pace with sea level rise. However, organic matter decomposition may also release plant nutrients, thereby stimulating increased biomass production and leading to a net organic matter increase and associated elevation gains . These highly organic soils are almost exclusively dependent on organic matter accumulation from root production and litter deposition for accretion, yet it is still unknown if burning is helpful or harmful to the future of coastal marsh ecosystems. The objective of this study was to elucidate the organic matter decomposition and nutrient availability responses of coastal marsh ecosystems to two primary mechanisms of prescribed fire-ash deposition and canopy removal ( Fig. 2-1). We used a one-year manipulative study across no burn and annual burn treatment islands at the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge in Cambridge, MD."}, {"section_title": "and Wildlife Service's Chesapeake Marshlands National Wildlife", "text": "Refuge Complex which manages four wildlife refuges on the Chesapeake Bay, with Blackwater NWR representing the largest area. Fire has been a disturbance which has been present throughout the development of Mid-Atlantic marshes such as those at Blackwater NWR. Both wild and prescribed fires play important roles in nutrient cycling within ecosystems . Nutrients contained in surface vegetation are redistributed through particulate (ash) and non-particulate (volatilization) pathways following fire . Particulate material can be redistributed from a burn site to adjacent areas through wind, rainfall, erosion, runoff, and leaching, or can remain onsite and may have a significant impact on the soil nutrient status and water quality . Increased post-fire nutrient concentrations in soil and water have been observed in numerous studies . Nutrients with relatively low volatilization temperatures, such as carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur, may be removed from the burn site through volatilization and result in atmospheric pollution ). In the face of climate change, numerous ecological processes within the marsh ecosystem may be affected. Soil organic matter decomposition rates, which control the mobilization of nutrients required for plant growth, and control organic matter turnover rates which affect the ability of marshes to vertically accrete with sea level rise, may have the largest implications relating to marsh sustainability due to environmental change . Numerous studies involving litterbag decomposition and chemical analysis have demonstrated that organic matter decomposition and turnover rates exert controlling factors on the chemistry and fertility of salt marsh soils . Decomposition rates in wetland environments are variable and influenced by a number of abiotic factors including nutrients, oxygen, hydroperiod, temperature, salinity, and pH . Increased organic matter decomposition may lead to elevation loss from these ecosystems, hindering their ability to keep pace with sea level rise. However, organic matter decomposition may also release plant nutrients, thereby stimulating increased biomass production and leading to a net organic matter increase and associated elevation gains . Although the decomposition of organic matter in wetlands has been extensively examined, few studies have specifically addressed the effects of fire on organic matter decomposition rates in marshes. A more thorough understanding of the mechanisms affecting organic matter decomposition rates in marshes following prescribed burning is needed to inform land managers of the most sustainable land management practices in these threatened areas."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Coastal Marsh Loss in the Mid-Atlantic Region", "text": "The Mid-Atlantic Region as a whole is at risk for extensive coastal marsh loss due to numerous reasons. Extensive areas of coastal marshes have been lost at alarming rates in Delaware (Phillips, 1986), Maryland , and in Virginia . As a result, the ability of these areas to provide the necessary functions to nesting water birds such as the great blue heron and snowy egret as well as numerous mammals and amphibians that inhabit these marshes may be in danger. Reasons for marsh loss in this reason include urban and suburban development, draining for agriculture, and eutrophication (STAC, 2003). However, it is widely believed that the largest future threat to coastal marshes in this area is increased rates of sea level rise in conjunction with land subsidence. The marshes at Blackwater NWR have been lost at alarming rates in the past century due to numerous interacting factors. It is estimated that since the 1930's, over 3,200 ha of tidal marshes have been converted to open water due to increased sea level rise rates, herbivory, land subsidence, erosion, and saltwater intrusion (U.S. Department of Interior, 2008). Sea level rise rates in the Blackwater NWR area have outpaced the ability of these marshes to accrete vertically, therefore leading to the loss of marsh areas to open water . Blackwater NWR represents an especially bad scenario for marshes in the Mid-Atlantic region when it comes to sea level rise vulnerability, as this area is facing greater land subsidence rates than other areas due to groundwater withdrawal for agriculture (DOI, 2006) and glacial rebound. Exacerbating these factors is the finding that many eastern shore marshes appear to have naturally lower rates of accretion . Additionally, these eastern shore marshes have a lower potential for sediment input than western shore marshes due to the lower elevation surrounding landscape and associated lower energy gradient for sediment transport, which is one of the main generalizations of why western shore marshes are more able to keep abreast with sea-level rise . Marsh loss typically occurs in several distinct stages . Stable coastal marshes show intact interior sections where large interior ponds are absent, and the abundance of tidal creeks is relatively low. As marsh loss begins to take place, tidal creeeks increase in number and widen, and small interior ponds form. These interior ponds enlarge and eventually coalesce as the marsh loss process proceeds, which extensive areas of coalescing interior ponds marking an advanced stage of marsh loss. Finally, concurrent lateral erosion of the shoreline area of the marsh merge with interior ponds and the area is lost. The U. S. Climate Change Science focused on the mid-Atlantic region in a 2009 report and has Blackwater NWR and the lower Dorchester County, MD region identified as the area most vulnerable to sea level rise (CCSP, 2009). This is the only area in the mid-Atlantic that is predicted with extremely high certainty to be lost under current sea-level rise rates within the next century. This does not even take into account the fact that due to climate change, the rate of sea level rise is expected to increase even beyond the current 3 -4 mm/year observed in the region (CCSP, 2009)."}, {"section_title": "Sea Level Affecting Marshes Modeling (SLAMM) done by the National Wildlife", "text": "Federation has reinforced these observations (NWF, 2008). SLAMM simulates changes in tidal marsh area and habitat type by simulating the dominant processes involved in wetland conversions and shoreline modification during long-term sea level rise. Three scenarios of eustatic SLR were used for modeling based off of scenarios given by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Under the scenarios, a 39 cm rise in sea level by 2100 would result in a 66 percent loss in brackish marshes, while a 69 cm rise in sea level would result in a drastic 94 percent loss in these marsh types. Current relative SLR rates on the nearby Choptank River of 3.52 mm/year (NOAA tide gauge 8571892, www.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov), would produce about a 32 cm rise in sea level, however this ignores the fact that these rates will be increasing in the future (CCPS, 2009).  suggested that, taking into account dynamic melting of the Greenland ice sheet and possible error, a range in SLR we may see by 2100 would be 50 to 140 cm. This habitat destruction has been costly for over 50,000 migrating geese, ducks, and tundra swans as the as the refuge is an important stop on the Atlantic flyway. Furthermore, the refuge is host to the largest breeding population of American Bald Eagles north of Florida, and marsh habitat destruction poses a significant risk to the future of these great birds. Therefore, future management operations at the refuge are concerned with marsh sustainability as one of, if not the main objective."}, {"section_title": "Fire History at Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge", "text": "Fire history at Blackwater NWR began by Native Americans as they used prescribed fire as a tool to clear land and facilitate fur trapping (U.S. Department of the Interior, 2001). Before European settlement, fires in this region were likely relatively frequent but temporally sporadic in nature, primarily due to anthropogenic causes (Pyne, 1995). After European settlement, the fire regime in this area changed to a practically annual winter burn regime to improve wildlife food production in the form of Schenoplectus americanus, and to facilitate the harvest of furbearing animals such as the muskrat and nutria (Pendleton and Stevenson, 1983). Prescribed fire has been used by land managers at Blackwater NWR since 1978(Dept. of Interior, 2006 as a land management technique in this area during the winter months . During this time, approximately 3000-4000 acres were burned on an annual basis (Dept. of Interior, 2001). In 1995, an evaluation of the prescribed fire program at Blackwater NWR and adjacent Fishing Bay Wildlife Management Area was implemented, which evaluated no burn, annual burn, 3-5 year burns, and 7-10 year buns on numerous marsh ecosystem attributes. This is important to recognize as it represents a release from almost 30 years of continuous prescribed burning for the no burn sites evaluated in this study. Prescribed fire has been viewed as an effective technique to promote the growth of favorable wetland vegetation on the East and Gulf coast ; however, the effect of this short term goal on long term marsh sustainability has not been investigated at length . Marsh fires can be classified into three groups as peat burns, root burns, and cover burns, differentiated by water level and soil conditions present at the time of burning . Peat burns are not used as a management tool as they burn into and remove peat soils, releasing carbon and lowering marsh surface elevation . Marshes may produce plant roots that grow upwards into surficial detritus accumulation, especially areas which have not been burned for several years. If fire occurs in these marshes and the litter layer burns, then the plant roots also burn resulting in a root burn . The most valuable, widely used burn type by land managers is the cover burn. The cover burn results from when several centimeters of water is above the marsh surface, and removes existing plant aboveground biomass by combustion and volatilization (Arthur 1931;Griffith 1949;. Cover burns are the main type of prescribed fire used by marsh managers in the Mid-Atlantic region (Griffith 1949, Dept. of Interior, 2006."}, {"section_title": "Coastal Marsh Elevation Dynamics", "text": "For a coastal marsh to survive, it must maintain its surface elevation close to that of the local sea level. Marshes accomplish this by the process of accretion, or vertical growth as sea levels rise. The main mechanisms behind accretion are surficial deposition of mineral sediment and organic debris, along with root deposition . While mineral sediment inputs may play a large role in marsh accretion in other physiographic settings, the drowned river valley marshes and low landscape elevation gradients typical of those on the eastern shore of the Chesapeake Bay are mineral sediment \"starved\" and rely primarily on organic matter inputs for their vertical development (Stevenson et al., 2002;. Due to low soil decomposition rates caused by anaerobic conditions in the absence of oxygen, belowground inputs to the marsh ecosystem, such as those by upward and lateral extension of rhizome and root networks, are generally regarded as having a greater contribution to marsh vertical accretion . Greater oxygen availability near the soil surface allows for faster decomposition of aboveground plant materials. Thus, any management practice which will increase the production of belowground biomass and therefore volume of soil will increase accretion rates. Globally, sea levels are rising, and there is significant evidence that the rate is not only accelerating, but also that anthropogenic contributions to atmospheric greenhouse gas levels and their associated glacier melt, as well as thermal ocean expansion are very likely the main cause (CCSP, 2009). Each year, global sea level rises approximately 1.8 mm due to an increase in water volume . The increased surficial flooding resulting from SLR will eventually drown out marsh areas that cannot keep pace, as the increased flooding stress will ultimately kill marsh vegetation (DOI, 2006). These affected areas will be converted to open water and lose substantial habitat value for wildlife. Another potential effect of inundation and breakup is the greater intrusion of saltwater into the upper reaches of the marsh, where the sulfate ion will be preferentially used by soil microbes for more efficient organic matter decomposition and may produce additional sulfide stress on the plants (DOI, 2006). When putting into context the ability of coastal marshes vulnerability to sea level rise, the actual measurement which should be used is relative sea-level rise, which takes into account land subsidence as well as eustatic sea level rise. This figure is often substantially greater than the global SLR rate of 1.8 mm/year, as can be seen by varying readings at tide gauges located in geographically similar locations . Throughout the Mid-Atlantic region, the RSLR rates are higher than global rates, due to the gradual sinking of the Earth's crust in response to the melting of the Laurentide ice sheet which did not come this far south and the compaction of aquifer sediments due to groundwater withdrawal . Currently, the relative rate of SLR in the nearby Choptank River is 3.52 mm/year (NOAA tide gauge 8571892, www.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov), which puts Blackwater NWR at one of the top locations in the Mid-Atlantic region with respect to SLR vulnerability."}, {"section_title": "Fire Ecological Mechanisms Affecting Coastal Marshes", "text": "Fire represents a drastic disturbance at the ecosystem level to coastal marshes, at the physical, biological, and chemical levels. Currently, observational evidence exists that burning tends to make marshes \"healthier,\" meaning that burned areas show less breakup and more evenly distributed grass species than non-burned areas. The two main mechanisms by which prescribed burns are suspected to affect coastal marsh ecosystems are through ash deposition in the form of combusted aboveground plant materials and by the removal of both alive and dead canopy vegetation. Due to the fact that prescribed burns in the Chesapeake Bay region are conducted during the winter times when most marsh grass species have sensed, the canopy which is ignited consists mainly of, if not completely of dead vegetation. Ash deposition from combusted aboveground plant tissues may be one mechanism responsible for marsh plant response to prescribed fire. Ash additions to the marsh soil represent a soluble, inorganic, plant-available source of nutrient additions, and may produce a \"fertilizer\" effect on marsh grasses. Typically, nitrogen is the primary nutrient lost to volatilization by fire , although significant amounts of sulfur and carbon are also lost and may contribute to atmospheric pollution . The quantity of nutrient loss resulting from fires is dependent on the temperature of the first, with the hottest fires creating white ash and resulting in nitrogen volatilization of near 100 percent . Also, ash additions to upland soils have shown to increase short-term pH levels in a Maryland coastal plain grassland ). Canopy removal is the other main mechanism which is suspected to effect herbaceous marsh vegetation following prescribed burning through increased light availability and increased soil temperatures. Previous research conducted in tall grass prairies has associated these mechanisms with vegetative growth stimulation following fires . The combustion of the senesced canopy from the previous year's growing season removes a physical barrier to emergence and growth of new vegetation. Increased light availability to emerging plant shoots lessens the completion factor for plants and increases the photosynthetic efficiency of the marsh, proving to be an important factor determining overall biomass production (Turitzan and Dranke, 1981). Removal of canopy and detritus could also provide increased solar radiation contacting the dark soil surface, increasing soil temperatures. This may extend the growing season by stimulating earlier spring growth, and may also increase nutrient availability for plants by stimulating soil organic matter mineralization, as has been observed in rangelands ."}, {"section_title": "Nutrient Dynamics and Plant Productivity in Marshes", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Wetland Nutrient Biogeochemistry", "text": "Biogeochemical cycling in wetlands involves the transport and transformation of chemicals and involves numerous interrelated physical, chemical and biological processes . The processes that exert control over the biogeochemical forms of nutrients, mainly redox status which is controlled by hydrology, are particularly important because they affect the spatial distribution of these nutrients within the wetland through such processes as plant uptake and sediment-water exchange. In turn, these nutrient flows are important determinants of wetland plant productivity and organic matter decomposition. Nutrient cycling is generally thought to occur most rapidly in wetland ecosystems that have pulsing hydrologic regimes, \"open\" hydrologic connections, and high rates of plant productivity. Brackish tidal marshes meet these three requirements, and thus a sound knowledge of the processes that determine nutrient availability is necessary to determine the overall effects of disturbance on these ecosystems. Specifically, the focus of this literature review will be on nitrogen and phosphorous because they are most often the limiting nutrients in wetland ecosystems and are both plant macronutrients. The Chesapeake Bay and its associated tidal marshes are subject to high rates of nitrogen and phosphorous loading, primarily from the anthropogenic sources of agriculture and urban development in the watershed . Any alteration of the nutrient biogeochemical cycling within tidal marshes will have implications to the sustainability of these areas in response to fire and thus the health of the Bay as a whole."}, {"section_title": "Nitrogen Biogeochemistry in Wetlands", "text": "Nitrogen is one of the most important elements in wetland ecosystems, as it is used in the production of numerous organic molecules, such as amino acids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Nitrogen appears in a number of dynamic chemical species and oxidation states; the transformation between these states is often microbially mediated. Nitrogen is commonly the limiting nutrient for plant primary production in wetlands. This is especially true for coastal wetlands and associated waters, where nitrogen abundance is relatively low to other nutrients, adding to the importance of understanding nitrogen dynamics in these ecosystems. This concept of nitrogen as the limiting factor stems from the anoxic conditions present in wetlands which allow for microbial denitrification of nitrates to gaseous nitrogen forms which are subsequently lost to the atmosphere. However, too much nitrogen loading into wetlands may lead to eutrophication and associated hypoxia (where dissolved oxygen concentrations fall below 2 mg/L), which causes damage to aquatic life and has become a major problem in coastal waters worldwide (NRC, 2000). Much of this problem stems from the fact that humans have approximately doubled the amount of nitrogen which enters the lithosphere through the Haber-Bosch process of fertilizer manufacturing, increasing usage of nitrogen-fixing legume crops, and fossil fuel burning . Finally, nitrogen in the form of nitrate provides one of the first electron acceptors in wetland soils after the loss of oxygen due to saturated conditions, making nitrogen availability important in the process of organic matter decomposition in wetlands. The nitrogen cycle begins as a process called nitrogen mineralization converts organically bound nitrogen, found in the organic matter of plant tissues and soil, to ammonium nitrogen (NH 4 -N) under both aerobic and anerobic conditions. This is known as ammonification and stems from numerous biological processes. The ammonium ion (NH 4 + ), with nitrogen in a reduced oxidation state of -3, is the most common form of nitrogen in wetlands. Once ammonium is formed, several pathways exist for this ion to travel. The ion can be taken up directly by plant root systems and incorporated into vegetative tissues, or by anaerobic bacteria, both which concert NH 4 + back into organic matter. The ammonium ion can be immobilized by negative charged soil particles as well, although this is most likely a minor process in organically derived soils such as those on the coastal marshes of the Chesapeake Bay. Furthermore, under basic conditions where the pH of water may be greater than 8, such as in calcareous or coastal environments  found an average spring pH of 7.98 and summer pH of 7.9 in waters of the Choptank River between 2003 and 2008), ammonium may be volatilized and lost from the wetland. Finally, oxidation of ammonium may occur, typically in the rhizosphere of plants or the upper zone of soil which may be intermittently exposed to oxygen when water tables fall, through a process called nitrification. Nitrification is carried out by two separate types of bacteria, first Nitrosomonas sp. which convert ammonium to nitrate, followed by Nitrobacter sp., which convert nitrite to nitrate. Nitrate (NO 3 -) is the next main nitrogen species of concern in wetlands, and it is more mobile than ammonium due to its negative charge which is likely to interact with soil particles. This mobility of nitrogen through the wetland system creates problems as nitrate is easily lost to groundwater or surface waters, where it commonly leads to eutrophication and hypoxia. Denitrification is the most common way nitrate is lost from a wetland, and involves the decomposition of organic substances by facultative anaerobic bacteria, which convert nitrate to molecular nitrogen and less substantially nitrous oxide. While release of molecular dinitrogen poses no environmental hazard, the production of nitrous oxide is of concern as it is a potent greenhouse gas. Conditions such as pulse-flooding rather than continuous saturation, along with location near aerobic/anaerobic wetland edges favor increased N 2 O production during denitrification . Overall, denitrification is typically limited by the nitrification rate, which is controlled by the diffusion of ammonium upwards into more aerobic soil layers, as it moves at a rate of about seven times faster than nitrate will diffuse back to the anaerobic layer . Denitrification is a significant pathway from which nitrogen is lost in all wetlands, including the brackish tidal marshes of the Chesapeake Bay. Nitrogen fixation represents the introduction of nitrogen from the atmosphere into the wetland ecosystem through organic matter assimilation. The atmosphere, composed of 80% nitrogen, represents an essentially limitless pool of this element, and certain aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, along with blue-green algae, are able to harness this source of nitrogen in the presence of the enzyme nitrogenase. Bacterial nitrogen fixation by nonsymbiotic bacteria or by symbiotic bacteria of the genus Rhizobium provide the most significant pathway for nitrogen fixation in brackish marsh soils. Other processes in the nitrogen cycle, which are relatively new discoveries, include dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA) and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). DNRA involves the conversion of nitrate to ammonium, and may be significant in instances of high organic carbon availability and/or low nitrate concentration, where this process is favored over denitrification . Numerous bacteria have been shown to carry out this process, and can be anaerobic, facultative, or aerobic. Anammox involves the oxidation of nitrate by ammonium to produce dinitrogen gas, and may be a substantial process in wetland environments limited by lack of a labile organic carbon source . However, it is unlikely that either of these processes dominate the nitrogen dynamics in Chesapeake Bay tidal marshes, where nutrient loadings and organic matter contents are high."}, {"section_title": "Phosphorus Biogeochemistry in Wetlands", "text": "Phosphorus is one of the most important limiting chemicals in ecosystems, as it forms the basis of the molecule ATP, upon which the energy for cellular respiration is stored. It has been shown that in most cases, freshwater wetlands and aquatic ecosystems are phosphorus, rather than nitrogen limited. However, while it is still important in saltwater marshes and coastal waters, it is not considered as a limiting factor due to its relative abundance and biogeochemical stability. The transformations involving phosphorus are markedly different from those involving nitrogen, whereas the nitrogen cycle is a microbially mediated system and the phosphorus cycle is dominated by physical, sedimentary processes. In wetland ecosystems, phosphorus occurs as soluble and insoluble complexes in both organic and inorganic forms. Organic forms of phosphorous may be soluble or insoluble, however both are unavailable for biological use and must go through the process of mineralization to the inorganic form for assimilation into plants and microrganisms. Inorganic forms are often lumped together and talked about as the orthophosphates (PO 4 3-, HPO 4 2-, and H 2 PO 4 -), with the dominant speciation dependent on pH. The orthophosphates represent the form of phosphorus which are both soluble and biologically available. Phosphorus forms are not directly affected by redox status, however their association with other compounds which control the availability of phosphorus to higher organisms are affected. Specifically, iron plays a large role in phosphorous availability in wetlands as it may bind with it to create insoluble iron phosphates. Upon introduction of anaerobic conditions, the ferric iron is reduced to ferrous iron and thus releases the bound phosphate for biological use. Also, the sorption of phosphorous onto the surfaces of clay particles is important in wetlands. This holds especially true for coastal salt marshes, where much of the phosphorus entering these ecosystems is brought by flooding rivers and tides depositing mineral clayphosphorous complexes on the marsh surface. Since macrophytic vegetation obtains nutrients for growth from the soil, this mechanism is important in allowing phosphorous to climb the trophic level allowing for higher wetland functions to thrive."}, {"section_title": "Estuarine Wetland Specific Biogeochemistry", "text": "It is important to note the uniqueness of the estuarine system, and connected tidal marshes, and they represent the focus and scope of this study. Whereas upland ecosystems are often relatively closed, connecting with adjacent hydrologic entities such as slow moving groundwater and smaller surface waters, estuaries represent places where rivers meet the sea and there is a significant dilution of freshwater with saltwater. Salt marshes are continuously exchanging physical and chemical materials with tidal waters, which in turn are influenced by local, regional, and seasonal conditions. The chemistry of the waters which affect salt marshes is significantly different than that of those affecting freshwater marshes. Nutrients enter coastal water bodies from numerous sources, including agriculture , sewage , and atmospheric deposition . Sea water is much higher in concentrations of sodium, magnesium, calcium, potassium, chloride, sulfate, and carbonates (all of which come mainly from oceanic sources) than freshwater under normal conditions, which in turn affects the ecological niches of these wetlands and the biogeochemical paths therein. Also, due to the large reservoir of salt water in the ocean compared to the small amount of freshwater, sea water maintains a chemical composition which is relatively constant across regions whereas freshwater is much more likely to be impacted by temporally sporadic events or local geophysical conditions. Finally, elements such as iron, silicon, and our focus nutrients of nitrogen and phosphorus are supplied to estuarine waters from freshwater sources, mainly rivers. Phosphate is usually abundant in salt marsh sediments and is rarely found to be the limiting nutrient for ecosystem productivity, especially in saltier regions ). The availability of this nutrient is closely related to iron and sulfide chemistry, as these form iron sulfides but released iron may bond with phosphate, restricting its mobility. A common pattern in estuarine systems is for a late summer phosphate maximum in the water column, as has been detected in Chesapeake Bay brackish marsh systems . Nitrogen is primarily utilized by vegetation as ammonium in salt marshes . However, nitrate is also a significant source of nitrogen supplied to estuaries, especially in the mid-Atlantic region, primarily through ground water losses from agriculture . Often, most of this nitrate is lost in winter when fields are in fallow, and generates strong pulses in stream waters near the upper reaches of the estuary. Event-scale pulses are also important for the delivery of nitrate into the estuary, and have been shown to deliver a disproportionally high amount of nitrate into the Chesapeake Bay during heavy storm flows (Prestegaard and O'Connell, 1995). Overall, the uptake and transformation processes of nitrate are strongly biochemically-driven in marsh soils and sediments . Anaerobic wetland soils with redox potentials similar to salt marsh soils have been documented to lose 30 to 90 mg N/L per day as a result of denitrification (Patrick et al. 1972). Tidal flushing is also likely to leach away nitrogen in both ammonium and nitrate forms . In the lower Chesapeake Bay near Carter's Creek, VA, Wolaver et al. 1983 conducted a 22month study to determine the exchange of nitrogen and phosphorus between a mesohaline marsh and the surrounding estuarine waters. The researchers found that there was a net annual removal of ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate from the tidal water as enters the marsh nutrient cycle. Only nitrite showed trends of net release from the marsh to the estuary waters."}, {"section_title": "Nutrient Additions and Plant Productivity", "text": "Understanding the interaction between plant productivity and nutrient levels is essential to this study for numerous reasons. Increased plant productivity has been observed in marshes following prescribed burns , and bottom-up forces in the form of nutrient additions (ash deposition), are one possible cause which is often assumed but has not been investigated at length. Salt marshes are nitrogen limited  yet highly productive environments (Bertness, 1992), and thus are potentially sensitive to changes in nutrient availability. Also, since marshes in the Chesapeake Bay region are dependent on organic matter inputs from plant production for accretion, nutrient fluxes due to prescribed burns may have significant ecological impacts in the organic matter cycling and, in turn, overall elevation of salt marshes . Several studies have been conducted using controlled fertilization experiments to address this issue. Crain 2007 conducted a 3-year in-situ fertilization addition experiment of 163 g N/m 2 /yr and 110 g P/m 2 /yr and found that two Spartina patens salt and brackish marshes in southern Maine were N limited, with possible secondary P limitation. The nutrients were added in three increments during the growing season, during May, June, and July, meaning that each addition gave the plants 54.3 g N/m 2 and 36.7 g P/m 2 . A significant increase (F=9.88, p<0.0001) in aboveground biomass relative to the control treatment was observed of 50% and 75% in N and N+P plots, respectively, over the first year of the study. In the third year, significant biomass increases were 100% (N plots) and 300% (N+P plots) greater than the control plots (F=62.47, p<0.0001). In a greenhouse study,  found that Spartina patens showed a doubling in biomass production (F=26.80, P<0.0001) with the addition of 10 g N/m 2 and 8.7 g P/m 2 when compared to non-fertilized mesocosms taken from southern Louisiana, both 8 and 12 weeks after fertilization. However, the fertilizer treatment combined application of nitrogen and phosphorous so any individual effects of the nutrients were impossible to determine.  conducted a greenhouse experiment and observed a significant (p<0.0001) increase in the aboveground biomass of all 15 Swiss wetland plant species examined when given weekly 0.95 g N/m 2 relative to the control treatment of 0.32 g N/m 2 . In the second year of the study, plant response to a phosphorus addition of 0.06 g P/m 2 increased shoot growth relative to the control treatment of 0.02 g P/m 2 , indicating that once nitrogen requirements were met by the plant, then advantages of P resources could be utilized. Alberti et al. 2009 conducted an in-situ study of the interaction between fertilization effects and crab herbivory on Spartina densiflora in the Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon in Argentina. When compared to control treatments without fertilizer, monthly additions (from January 2006 through June 2007) of 8.7 g N/m 2 and 1.5 g P/m 2 increased plant biomass 4.5 times on the marsh-mudflat edge and 6.5 in the low marsh area (p<0.05). In a study conducted by  at the Argentinian marshlands of the Bahia Samborombon, bi-weekly (from December 2005 through April 2007) of Spartina alterniflora by the addition of 4.35 g N/m 2 and 0.75 g P/m 2 showed numerous results. Aboveground biomass increases of 5.3 times (F=255.71, p<0.0001) were observed compared to non-fertilized plots, and a doubling of stem density was observed (F=48.32, p<0.0001). Also, stem heights increased by a factor of 1.65 (F=108.25, p<0.0001). Levine et al. 1998 conducted a fertilization experiment at the Rumstick Cove salt marsh in Rhode Island. From April to September in 1993 and 1994, additions of 4.35 g N/m 2 and 0.45 g P/m 2 were applied to marsh plots of 4 common East Coast salt marsh plant species. It was found that fertilization doubled the monoculture biomass of Spartina alterniflora (p<0.05), Spartina patens (p<0.05), and Distichlis spicata (p<0.05). A multiyear study was conducted by Gratton and Denno 2003 in a Spartina alterniflora dominated salt marsh near Tuckerton, New Jersey. The study was designed to represent a nutrient pulse event to the marshes, and essentially contained two separate experiments. In the meadow experiment, 60 g N/m 2 was applied biweekly for 4 weeks in mid-May 1998. A significant (p<0.05) 3-fold increase in fertilized Spartina biomass over control plots was observed in the first year after fertilization, with significant (p<0.05) increases in nitrogen plant tissue content as well (1.4%). The second experiment involved adding 120 g N/m 2 to Spartina plots biweekly for 8 weeks starting in mid-May 1999. This produced a significant (p<0.05) 2.5 fold increase in the aboveground fertilized Spartina biomass over control plots, and resulted in a significant (p<0.05) 1.5 -1.8% increase in the nitrogen content of the plant tissue. fertilizer was applied to plots at the rate of 4.35 g N/m 2 and 0.45 g P/m 2 starting in mid-May 1997 and continuing through the end of August. The next year, the same fertilizer treatment was applied and analyses were performed at the end of August. General findings of the study were that monoculture plots of Spartina alterniflora, Spartina patens, and Distichlis spicata showed a doubling in biomass compared with nonfertilzed plots. However, no statistics were performed on these findings as the paper was mainly focused on competitive interactions in mixed species plots. van Wijen and Bakker 1999 performed a fertilization experiment that was perhaps the most applicable to real world nutrient availability rates in marshes. They applied nitrogen at low (5 g/m 2 /yr) and high (25 g/m 2 /yr) rates and phosphorus at low (2 g/m 2 /yr) and high (10 g/m 2 /yr) rates to different areas of a salt marsh on the island of Schiermonnikoog in the Netherlands. Results from the experiment showed that phosphorus addition alone had little effect on plant biomass unless paired with nitrogen, indicating that nitrogen was limiting plant growth. Nitrogen addition significantly (p < 0.001) explained increases in biomass compared to control plots in the experiment. The low N application rate proved to show drastic vegetation changes when applied to the younger marsh areas, which were found to have N mineralization rates of 2.5 g N/m 2 /yr, while it took the high N application rate to overcome the N mineralization rate of 12.7 g N/m 2 /yr in the older marsh areas. Mendelssohn 1979 conducted a fertilization study on Spartina alterniflora in a North Carolina salt marsh. Nitrogen additions of 56.0 g/m 2 added in two split increments, once on June 10 th and again on July 22, 1976, doubled the aboveground production of smooth cordgrass. Plant responses in the form of increased biomass were shown at all N application levels of 28.0, 56.0, and 112 g N/m 2 . The range of N applications showed a 49% to 172% increase in biomass yield.  examined Spartina alterniflora response to additions of both nitrogen and phosphorus. Ammonium-N and phosphate-P were added to plots in May 1976 at a rate of 20 g/m 2 . Nitrogen additions significantly increased total aboveground plant biomass and plant height by 28% and 25%, respectively, 4 months after fertilization. Phosphorous additions did not significantly affect plant height and biomass. It is also worth noteing that although most of the work on fertilization studies in marshes has focused on aboveground plant response, the majority of annual biomass production occurs belowground, and this production is expected to contribute more significantly to marsh vigor . The hypothesis that increased nutrient availability may develop lower root:shoot ratios for Spartina alterniflora, as observed in grasslands when soil fertility and aboveground biomass increase  has been explored by a several researchers with mixed results. Darby and Turner, 2008 (a,b) found that nutrient enrichment, especially with phosphorus, reduces belowground productivity of Spartina alterniflora. The authors theorized that this is due to plants putting more resources towards developing aboveground tissue for photosynthesis rather than belowground tissues for nutrient scavenging in high fertility conditions. In addition to less carbon produced belowground, soil metabolism may also increase as denitrification uses carbon as an electron donor, leading to diminished pools of soil carbon . The end result is less carbon being produced and more carbon being metabolized and lost. Conversely,  found that fertilization with either nitrogen or phosphorus did not decrease belowground production or soil carbon over a 5-year study in a central Long Island Sound salt marsh dominated by Spartina alterniflora. The authors concluded that observed increases in CO 2 fluxes from the soil were compensated for by other processes. Thus, the effects of nutrient additions on belowground production in salt marshes remains understudied and unclear, relative to aboveground biomass studies. In summary, nitrogen appears to have dramatic effects on emergent salt marsh vegetation aboveground biomass and density when added at rates of at or above 5 g/m 2 /yr. Nitrogen needs to be about double the rate of natural mineralization for an effect in vegetation to be seen (van Wijen and Bakker, 1999). The effects of phosphorus appear to be much less dramatic and only effect vegetation after initial nitrogen limitations have been overcome, if at all. A summary table of the results detailed in this section can be found in  "}, {"section_title": "Nutrients and Soil Organic Matter Decomposition in Wetlands", "text": "Ecosystem nutrients and soil organic matter decomposition are closely related to one another. Through the process of decomposition, soil organic matter can contribute to the availability of nutrients for plant growth through mineralization. Conversely, the availability of nutrients is suspected to be a major factor controlling organic matter decomposition, although relatively few studies have attempted to differentiate between which environmental factors exert control over organic matter decomposition in the field (Mendelsshon et al. 1999, Latter and. Some of the studies that have attempted to measure the relationship of nutrients and soil organic matter decomposition in wetlands are summarized in this section. Mendelsshon et al. 1999 attempted to elucidate the relationship of soil environmental conditions and soil organic matter decomposition rates, as determined by the cotton strip method, along a salinity gradient in a Phragmites dominated coastal marsh in Jutland, Denmark. CTSL rates ranged from a high of 5.5% per day to a low of 1.8% per day, with a general trend of CTSL rates decreasing with depth. Soil porewater interstitial nitrogen (NH 4 + NO 3 ) was highest at the lowest salinity site and significantly lower at the remaining marsh sites. Phosphorous varied similarly to N, K, Mg, Na, S, Mo, Fe, and Mn, with the lowest concentration at the freshwater sites and greater concentrations at the saltier sites. For decomposition data analysis, the 20 environmental variables which were collected at the 7 sampling locations with the 7 marsh sites were simplified into three major principal components describing the variation in the environmental data. The largest percentage of the variation (45%) was explained by the first principal component, which had high loadings for conductivity, K, Na, and Mg and was interpreted as a salinity-related factor. An additional 25% of the variation was explained by principal component 2 and had high loadings for NH 4 , P, and sulfide, and was interpreted as a nutrient-soil reduction related factor. Principal component 3 further explained 10% of the variation and had high loadings for B, S, and Ca, and was also likely to be salinity related to seawater. Together, these three principal components explained 79% of the variation in the environmental data, with salinity and soil nutrient reduction status explaining the greatest amount of variation. These three principal components were then used as independent variables in a multiple regression where the dependent variable was CTSL. Two of the three principal components were significant in the multiple regressions. An investigation between soil organic matter decomposition in a Maryland marsh affected by an oil spill was examined by Mendelsshon and Slocum 2004. The investigators found that, contrary to their hypothesis, oil did not have a significant effect on soil organic matter decomposition rates. Rather, abiotic factors played the largest role in determining organic matter decomposition rates. Principal component analysis revealed four principal components explaining 78% of the variation in the data set, two of which were found to have a significant effect on decomposition (stepwise linear regression: df=2, 33, F = 12.6, p < 0.0001). The first principal component consisted of salt and pH factors, and had a negative effect on decomposition and explained a substantial proportion of the variation in soil data (r 2 = 0.38). This suggests that higher salinity and lower pH decreased decomposition rates, a theory supported by simple correlation between decomposition rate with these various measures of soil chemistry. The second principle component, Eh, had a marginally significant effect on decomposition (F = 3.1, p = 0.09), yet explained a very small amount of the data set's variation (r 2 = 0.05). The third and fourth principal components identified, representing nitrogen and phosphorus respectively, were not significant to decomposition rates.  examined the relationship between decomposition indices and physiochemical soil properties in a minerotrophic mire ecosystem. Also, the relationship between decomposition indices and plant community types was examined. They found that cellulose decomposition rate showed differences corresponding to plant community types, but could not determine any correlation between cellulose decomposition and water table level data. Cellulose decomposition rates also showed a significant positive correlation with the pH of pore water.  reviewed 24 publications that examined nutrient amendments on wetland soil litter decomposition rates. Out of the 24 studies, eight showed enhanced rates of decomposition, seven showed variable effects dependent on environmental conditions, and nine found no hosphorus effect. It was noted however, that nitrogen rather than phosphorus limits decomposition, although phosphorus can stimulate decomposition after primary nitrogen limitations have been alleviated. Rubio and Childers examined the effects of nutrient availability on litter decomposition in oligotrophic phosphorus-limited Florida Everglades estuaries. Litter bags filled with Cladium jamaicense, Eleocharis spp., and Juncus roemerianus were transplanted into two estuaries, one which received appreciable amounts of marine P and one which did not. Over the 18 month deployment period, beginning in December 2001, the researchers found that increasing nutrient availability led to higher decomposition rates, although the rates were species specific. The effects of increasing N and P were likewise species specific. If any generalization about nutrients relative to wetland soil organic matter rates can be made, it is that none can be made. Typically, decomposition rates, like nutrient availability, are highly variable over vary small distances and change with environmental conditions. Therefore, studies on these relationships are ecosystem dependent and must be taken with caution in extrapolation to wider environments."}, {"section_title": "Fire and Nutrient Availability", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Fire and Ash Characteristics", "text": "Probably the most obvious direct ecosystem consequence, next to removal of vegetation and production of volatilized compounds (a.k.a. smoke), is the production of ash. Ash represents a mineralization of the organically bound nutrients within plants, at least those of which are not lost to volatilization and removed from the ecosystem. The ash, once deposited onto the soil, is often rich in basic cations such as K, Mg, and Ca, which have high volatilization temperatures not produced during prescribed burns. These cations are present as soluble salts which, upon contact with water, undergo hydrolysis and produce alkalinity . The cations themselves are also readily available for plant uptake and serve as a fertilizer source which may or may not be significant, dependent on ash nutrient content, amount of ash deposited, and time of deposition. Ash nutrient content has been studied in numerous studies.  found that volatilization losses of N and K from Juncus romerianus and Spartina cynosuroides were 90% and 50%, respectively. Ash nutrient content in post-fire residues broke down to approximately 0.3 g N/m 2 , 0.3 g P/m 2 , 1.9 g K/m 2 , 1.7 g Ca/m 2 , 1.8 g Mg/m 2 , 0.2 g Mn/m 2 , and 0.25 g Fe/m 2 .  found that the primary cations in burned grassland vegetation were Ca (1.12%), Mg (0.17%), and K (0.24%), while Na, Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu concentrations were all below 0.1% of the ash.  used laboratory simulation methods to evaluate temperature effects on the nutrient composition of sawgrass and cattail ash. Almost all (99%) of total nitrogen and total carbon were lost via volatilization at 450 and 550 \u00b0C. This finding corresponded to earlier findings by Certini, 2005 who both found nearly complete organic matter combustion at temperatures of 400 to 500 \u00b0C. Approximately 30 to 70% of the total nitrogen was lost from 150 to 350 \u00b0C. The authors successfully modeled the loss of nitrogen as a function of burn temperature with good accuracy, according to the equation y=0.01(x 1.46 ), r 2 =0.83, where y=total nitrogen loss (%) and x=burn temperature (\u00b0C). Modeling the response of phosphorus to fire was more difficult, although a decent relationship between laboratory ash total hosphorus:plant leaf total phosphorus and burn temperature. The equation=5.96+3.25e (0.004x) , r 2 =0.73, where y=lab ashTP:leafTP and x=burn Temperature (\u00b0C). It is worth noteing that the authors realized that while nitrogen is lost primarily through the volatilization pathway, phosphorus may be lost through volatilization and, more predominantly, through fine particulate losses . This makes field determination of P losses through a fire more difficult and problematic to determine than N losses. Findings of this study show that fires which maintain intensities fewer than 350 \u00b0C may contain approximately half of the fuel sources' original nitrogen content and thus may constitute a more effective fertilizer source than more intense fires. Fires with intensities greater than 450 \u00b0C will likely provide no nitrogen fertilization to vegetation. Liu et al. 2010 examined the incubation release of phosphorus from cattail and sawgrass ash taken from the Florida Everglades. Laboratory ash samples were made by combusting the plant tissues at 400 \u00b0C based on the Qian et al. 2009 study above, which was supposed to simulate natural burning conditions. Based on the Qian et al. 2009 study, it was assumed that nitrogen addition to the ecosystem by ash was minimal, and so phosphorus was the nutrient of focus. The study performed incubation extractions on the ash at small increments for the first day (0, 2, 8, 12 and 24 hours) followed by longer term measurements on the order of days and weeks up through 65 days. Approximately 17.4% of the cattail biomass became ash and 19.8% of the sawgrass tissue became ash. Key findings of this study include the fact that the first 24 hours after burning are critical in P release from the ash. Approximately 60 to 80 percent of the P that would be released over the entire incubation period was released in the first 24 hours, leading the authors to note that water stagnation following a fire would be a key factor in allowing plant uptake rather than generating a P pulse downstream. The P salts left in ash following a burn can release large amounts of P into surface waters, on the order of 3.5 * 10 3 micrograms P/L for tricalcium phosphate, and most likely even more for magnesium phosphate due to its higher solubility . In summary, the ash characteristics of a fire are dependent on plant species, habitat nutrient availability, live/dead status of aboveground biomass and perhaps most importantly fire intensity. Basic cations (e.g. K, Mg, Ca) tend to accumulate in ash and may potentially increase surficial soil pH, although in tidal systems this effect is likely to be minimal. Burn temperatures over 400 \u00b0C likely volatilize most, if not all, of the organic compounds present and provide minimal fertilization value especially with respect to nitrogen and phosphorus. Thus, fire intensity is a primary factor in predicting how ecosystems will respond to fire."}, {"section_title": "Fire and Soil Nutrients in Upland Ecosystems", "text": "Numerous studies have been conducted in upland ecosystems concerning nutrient dynamics following fire. Some key studies will be examined in this section to supplement the following section, as the literature on nutrient dynamics pertaining to marsh fires is limited compared to studies in upland environments.  studied the effects of prescribed burning management on grassland ecosystem restoration in the Mid-Atlantic, with a special focus on soil chemical properties. The study found that the general effects of a mid-April burn on properties of the ultisol were short lived and dissipated within one years' time. Soil pH had increased significantly (p<0.05) in both surface and subsurface horizons 11 days following burning. Surface soil horizon pH rose from 5.72 to 5.94, which is similar to the average pH rise of 0.23 found in all horizons from 0 to 20 cm. However, this effect was short lived and was no longer present after 1 year. Small increases in extractable Ca and Mg were found after days, but no increase was found for other nutrients examined (K, Na, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, S, and P). Overall, the authors concluded that the effects of fire with respect to the soil environment were short lived and minimal. Picone et al. 2003 found shifting in the soil nutrient pools and microbial activity following winter-spring burning in the Flooding Pampa region of Buenos Aires. Following burning, microbial biomass C and N were higher in the burned (433 mg C/kg and 37 mg N/kg) than in the unburned treatment (386 mg C/kg and 26 mg N/kg). The authors attributed this to higher temperatures attained in the surface soil layers during burning , which increased decomposition rates and in turn mineralization rates of organic matter .  examined the effect of moderate-intensity wildfires on soil and stream characteristics at Sugar Pine State Park in Lake Tahoe, California. The prescribed fire was done in October 1996 to selected forested areas, and soils were sampled 3 months before and after the burns for comparison. Large increases in ammonium were found in the post burn soils, from 1.56 mg NH 4 /kg pre burn to 38.43 mg NH 4 /kg post burn, which was attributed to the conversion of organic N to reduced inorganic N forms. Nitrate did not show any significant increases post burn, and the authors noted that this matched up well with numerous other studies who found little to no NO 3 increases post burn . Surface soil depths showed an increase in phosphorus from 0.03 to 0.04% P by mass which was attributed to ash deposition but not considered significant.  studied the effects of a spring fire on Kentucky barrens restoration, which represent small grassland patches nestled among forest habitat. The soils of this area were classified as Typic Haplualfs. Using resin capsules installed for 30 days immediately post burn, ammonium and nitrate levels were found not to differ between control and burned plots. Likewise, extractable soil P did not show any response to burning, and while extractable cations such as K, Ca, and Mg did show slight increases, these were not substantial or suspected to provide any noticeable change in ecosystem function. In summary, the effects of fire on the nutrient status of soils in upland ecosystems following fire tend to be short lived, if any effects are seen at all. Fire appears to be used mostly to reduce fuel loads for public safety. Land managers also use burning to manipulate plant community composition in favor of native vegetation, especially in grasslands, by eliminating woody invaders and non-native vegetation (Packard and Mutel 1997). Nutrient fluxes are often ignored as a negligible side effect of attaining these primary goals."}, {"section_title": "Fire and Soil Nutrients in Marshes", "text": "Fire relating to nutrient dynamics in marshes is remarkably different from the effects that may be shown in upland ecosystems. This is mainly suspected to be a function of fluctuating water levels, at or near the surface where ash would be deposited. The following studies have examined the effects of fire as it pertains to plant nutrients.  examined the effects of aboveground (surface) fires similar to those in Mid-Atlantic marshes on soil fertility characteristics following fire in a northern Florida Everglades marsh. Sites in the Rotenberger Wildlife Management Area were sampled pre-burn in February 1998, ignited by a lightning strike in May 1999, and sampled post-burn in June 1999. The authors found that surface burning resulted in decreases of 0.6 kg N/ha and 11.9 kg C/ha attributed to the volatilization of these nutrients due to the intensity of the fire. Organic P also decreased in the 0-to 2-cm soil layer due to surface fire; however there was no significant corresponding enrichment of any inorganic P fraction present, indicating P was also lost to volatilization or physical erosion. The study stressed the importance of differentiating between surface and peat fires, as peat fires alter soil nutrient status drastically while surface fires are relatively mild in their effects. Faulkner and de la Cruz, 1982 looked at the effects of prescribed winter burning on nutrient pools in a St. Louis Bay, Missouri marsh. They noted that enhancement of the soil nutrient pool by ash deposition was limited to the top 2 cm of the soil. Surficial pH levels increased but were short-lived in a Juncus marsh (less than 29 days); however the increase in pH remained after 68 days in a Spartina marsh. Phosphorus levels increased dramatically following burning (from 23 to 83 mg/kg) and remained elevated 68 days post-burn (88 mg/kg). The P increase could not be solely attributed to ash deposition and was hypothesized to be partially from mild sediment heating. Potassium levels increased by 47% (from 409 to 600 mg/kg) at the Juncus marsh and by 10% (from 446 to 490 mg/kg) at the Spartina marsh. These levels remained elevated 68 days post burn. Calcium levels increased over 30% at both sites and remained elevated at the Spartina site 68 days post burn. Nitrogen levels remained unchanged in the Juncus site and slightly lowered at the Spartina site. Water levels during burning, which were at low tide, were most likely responsible for higher than average soil temperatures which resulted in the nutrient status changes, rather than ash deposition. Laubhan 1995 measured the effects of fire on wetland soil macronutrients in southwest Missouri. Following both winter and spring burning, no detectable differences in soil nutrients could be determined for any nutrient investigated (NO 3 -N, P, K, Ca, Mg) by the end of the growing season. The lack of change was related to the low fuel biomass present; the authors noted that this finding was similar to the findings of . Schmalzer and Hinkle 1992 found that November burning increased calcium, magnesium, potassium, and phosphate 1 month after burning of a Juncus roemerianus and Spartina bakeri marsh in Florida. These increased levels of nutrients were found to persist from 6 to 12 months postburn. However, nitrate-N and ammonium-N did not differ between burned and unburned marsh sites. Wilbur and Christensen 1983 looked at soil nutrient levels as they responded to fire in a North Carolina pocosin. A spring burn in March of 1979 was implemented and the soil characteristics were monitored for just over one year. Phosphate levels increased dramatically in burned areas, although the variance was high indicating that the dispersal of phosphate was not uniform. Nitrate concentrations were higher consistently and significantly higher in the burned areas during the first and second growing seasons, although much notably less in the second season. Soil ammonium was higher in burned areas as well, although much less consistently. Magnesium levels were higher in the burned areas than the control areas throughout the course of the monitoring. Calcium concentrations were either the same as or lower in burned areas compared to control areas. Potassium levels showed an increase in the growing season immediately following burning, but showed lower levels compared with control plots the following year. The authors concluded that prescribed fire increased the availability of plant nutrients in this ecosystem, leading to increased post-fire biomass production, and that it also created patchiness within the ecosystem with areas of low and high nutrients. One detail to note is that this burn appeared to be extreme in nature, burning into the peat often enough to be called a peat fire. The literature tends to converge on the importance that water level during the time of burning plays on marsh soil chemistry. Water level effects whether or not the burn will directly affect the marsh soil through combustion, whether the burn will indirectly effect the marsh soil through warming, or whether the effects of burning on the marsh soil will be minimal through ash deposition. Ash deposition is thought to supply a readily available source of soluble plant nutrients, however the hydrology of wetlands with fluctuating water tables near the surface appear to \"wash out\" most nutrients before they are used for plant uptake."}, {"section_title": "Fire and Organic Matter Dynamics", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Fire and Soil Organic Matter Decomposition in Upland Ecosystems", "text": "The ecosystem disturbance of fire may directly affect the status of organic matter in a coastal marsh, both above and belowground. The most direct effect of prescribed winter fire is the combustion of senesced aboveground herbaceous plant tissue as it provides fuel. This may have wide ranging implications to marsh sustainability, especially in marshes which rely mainly on organic matter inputs for accretion such as those in the Chesapeake Bay region, as it removes vegetation which could be incorporated into the marsh surface. The relationship between prescribed burning in marshes and accretionary processes which are largely determined by soil organic matter additions are not well understood . No study to date has tried to directly determine the effects of burning on organic matter decomposition rates in coastal wetlands, so this section will attempt to summarize the few studies that have made an attempt at understanding the relationship between processes related to organic matter decomposition in upland ecosystems. Most of the previous research on the relationship between fire and organic matter has been conducted in rangeland ecosystems, where burning is used to promote earlier grass germination in the spring, eliminate weeds and brush, obtain greater animal gains, and to promote uniform grazing distribution (Anderson et al. 1970). This makes sense as rangelands (i.e. grasslands, shrublands, savannas, deserts) represent about 50% of the earth's land area (Allen-Diaz, 1996) when compared to the 4-6% wetland areas comprise Aselman and Crutzen, 1989). The bulk of these studies have found that the net effect is approximately neutral, as increased belowground biomass production has equaled carbon volatilization losses. Owensby and Wyrill, 1973 studied the effects of prescribed burning on soil physiochemical properties in annually burned pachic argiustolls in the Flint Hills of Kansas. Soil organic matter levels were found to increase approximately 0.20% in winter and spring-burned plots when compared to mid-spring, late-spring, and non-burned plots. The authors attributed this increase in soil organic matter due to increased root production rather than surface accumulation of aboveground vegetation.  found that annual burning on a grazed tallgrass prarie resulted in an increase in soil carbon storage of 0.22 Mg/ha/yr.  found that soil organic matter levels increased shortly after prescribed burning but were not statistically significant and did not differ from pre-burn levels after one year. Aboveground biomass combustion can also produce a carbon form extremely resistant to decomposition known as charcoal, which has been shown to account for up to 30% of the soil carbon in Australian rangeland soils . However, methods to measure this highly refracterant form of C remain unrefined and usually involve photo-oxidation of the soil, followed by scanning electron microscopy examination for wood-like morphology in the remaining particles, followed by solid state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ."}, {"section_title": "Fire and Plant Productivity in Marshes", "text": "As discussed above, no study to date has directly measured organic matter decomposition dynamics in coastal marshes. It has been noted however, that organic matter inputs and soil elevation are directly related to plant productivity, especially in eastern shore marshes which are sediment starved. The focus of this section will be on plant responses to fire that are primary controls on vertical accretion in these marshes. Any positive or negative response of marsh vegetation to prescribed fire would have implications relating to marsh sustainability. Penfound and Hathaway 1938 first suggested that burning could lead to decreased vertical accretion and sedimentation in marsh ecosystems. This study focused on the concern that repeated removal of aboveground biomass could negatively impact the ability of the marsh surface to capture sediment inputs, and to incorporate the senesced vegetation into the soil surface. Gabrey and Afton 2001 studied plant biomass response to winter burning in Gulf Coast marshes, and found results similar to Bickford et al., in review. They found that burning significantly (p<0.05) affected above-ground live biomass, with burned plots having higher biomass than unburned plots. However, no below-ground biomass response was observed in the study. The apparent non-effect that winter burning had on belowground biomass suggests that burning may not enhance soil elevation; however enhanced aboveground growth may increase sedimentation the following growing season. De la Cruz and Hackney 1980 examine the effects of winter fire on productivity on Juncus roemerianus and Spartina cynosuroides marshes in Mississippi. Winter burning of the Juncus marsh increased the primary aboveground biomass productivity by 21 to 48% the following growing season, and primary productivity in the Spartina marsh increased by 12 to 24% over the control plots. However, species specific effects were noted, especially concerning the Juncus marsh in which the increase in aboveground biomass production was associated with a general decrease in plant vigor. This was attributed to the fact that the species was not completely senesced at the time of burning, and thus harm may have been inflicted to the plants by burning. The Spartina marshes responded better to the fire treatment; the authors concluded that these communities may benefit from annual burning. Conversely, the Juncus communities would not benefit from burning, and may have natural fire protection mechanisms evolved to exclude fire such as lack of accumulated dry biomass and debris. Flores et al. 2011 examined the response of two fire rotations (annual and 3 year) on marsh vegetation response at the Blackwater NWR in Cambridge, MD. The authors found that Distichlis spicata biomass was greater in annual burn treatments than in 3 year burn treatments. For Schoenoplectus americanus, Spartina alterniflora, and Spartina patens no biomass differences were observed between burn treatments. The authors concluded that burning may increase the abundance of vegetation thought to be less desirable as wildlife habitat; it should be noted that these trends oppose those in the bulk of the literature. In the only study to directly measure soil accretion and elevation after a burn event,  used Surface Elevation Tables to monitor a Spartina patens coastal marsh in Texas. An accidental wildfire occurred at this marsh during the middle of the growing season, and results suggested that were no effects on soil vertical accretion, but at least a two year positive effect was observed on soil elevation. The authors hypothesized that the rapid mineralization of organic matter during the growing season resulted in an increase in overall soil organic matter production, possibly belowground.  examined the effects of four burn regimes (annual, 3-5 year, 5-7 year, 7-10 year) on above-and belowground plant response over 2 years at Blackwater NWR. The study found no effects on burn regime and plant production in 2004; however in 2005 the annual burn treatment produced greater aboveground biomass than other burn treatments. The belowground biomass did not show any difference between burn regimes in either year. Belowground vegetation biomass plays a large role in regulating ecosystem process, specifically soil organic matter production in tidal wetlands and therefore in the ability of these ecosystems to keep pace with sea-level rise . Therefore, belowground biomass production may be a better index for monitoring marsh ecosystem health than above-ground plant biomass .  showed a direct relationship between vertical marsh accretion rate and the accumulation of soil organic matter, mostly contributed by the below-ground biomass of marsh vegetation. Unfortunately, little information is currently available on belowground biomass and the associated responses to change in environmental conditions in coastal wetlands . Overall, the literature suggests that there is much to be learned about plant productivity effecting organic matter dynamics in marshes following fire events. The biggest concern for organic matter dynamics in mid-Atlantic marshes is that it may contribute to or reduce marsh elevation, as these soils are highly organic in nature with little mineral input. Therefore, the directionality of the decomposition/formation process of organic matter, especially in the root zone, is of major concern. Even if soil organic matter decomposition is increased following prescribed burning, if the resulting vegetative growth is enhanced then the total amount of organic matter present may be increased and thus the marsh would be more adept to keep pace with sea level rise."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Coastal ecosystems worldwide and in the U.S. are pressured by population growth, leaving them vulnerable to pollution, overfishing, invasive species, habitat degradation and loss, and increased coastal hazards such as sea-level rise WRI, 2000;National Safety Council, 1998  ). The Chesapeake Bay watershed ranked at the top of the growth rate chart for U.S. coastal watersheds in the years of 1980 through 2000, growing by over two million people to a total population of over 10 million (NOAA, 2004). As the largest, most productive, and most diverse estuary in North America (NOAA, 1990;Prasad et al., 2011), protection of this resource is of the upmost importance for the land managers, citizens, and lawmakers of this region. Fire affects marshes through the mechanisms of canopy removal and ash deposition. Coastal marshes are nitrogen limited environments, however any management practice related to the dynamics of either nitrogen or phosphorus are likely to affect primary production. As coastal marshes face increasing rates of sea level rise, those which have low mineral inputs, such as Eastern Shore marshes, rely almost entirely on plant production for vertical accretion. Annually burned areas also had significantly lower porewater NH 4 + readings in sites with the canopy removed by burning (0.13 \u00b1 0.04 mg/L) in July compared with the canopy replacement treatment (0.79 \u00b1 0.20 mg/L; P=0.005). Through the mechanism of canopy removal, organic matter decomposition rates in marsh areas tended to decrease later in the growing season, corresponding with a decrease in porewater ammonium and phosphate, which were taken up in much higher quantities in the biomass. Plant ash provided a fertilizer pulse of 0.22 \u00b1 0.02 g N/m 2 and 0.16 \u00b1 0.02 g P/m 2 , which are amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus too small to increase plant productivity, and this likely holds true across all coastal marsh habitats."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Site Description", "text": "The study site was Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge (38\u00b0 27' 0\" N, 76\u00b0 7' 12\" W) located on the Eastern Shore of Maryland in Dorchester County (Fig. 2-2 which were present to a lesser extent were located on areas where the marsh was fringing on upland forest and were classified as Honga (Terric Sulfihemists) and Sunken (Typic Endoaqualfs) (Table 2-1).

The cotton strip technique for measuring organic matter decomposition is based on the loss of tensile strength of a buried cotton fabric composed of cellulose fibers. Cellulose comprises about 70% of the organic carbon found in plant tissue, and therefore the rate of its decay is a key factor in plant matter decomposition . The resulting cotton tensile strength loss gives a quantitative measurement of decomposition rates. This technique has been used in many different terrestrial environments, including wetlands, as a relative measure of soil decomposition . At each plot, a strip of 10 x 35 cm of a 200-thread-count unbleached muslin fabric was inserted into the marsh soil by first making a pilot hole with the aid of a sharpshooter shovel, and then placing the fabric against the back of the shovel and inserting it into the hole. The saturated environment of the marsh soil provided enough suction to gently pull the cotton strip away from the shovel and into contact with the soil. The soil surface level was marked with a lateral cut into the fabric for future reference during analysis. The first set of cotton strips were placed into the center of plots on May 18 th and 19 th , and were retrieved from the ground on June 2 nd and 3 rd . The second set of cotton strips were deployed on June 30 th through July 2 nd and collected on July 15 th through the 17 th . The 15-day deployment period was similar to that used by  in a Phragmites australis marsh in Denmark. Three reference cotton strips were inserted into the marsh and immediately removed at each deployment date. These strips were used to quantify the tensile strength of the non-decomposed cotton fabric, taking into account insertion and removal strength loss issues. Retrieval involved a mixture of light pulling on the exposed fabric and excavation around the strip. Immediately following retrieval, the strips were washed with freshwater to remove any attached soil particles or debris, and then were placed in bags for transport. Back in the laboratory, these strips were washed more thoroughly with deionized water and allowed to air dry for 72 hours. The strips were then cut laterally into 4 cm horizontal segments from 0 to 20 cm, giving strip segments representing 0 -4, 4 -8, 8 -12, 12 -16, and 16 -20 cm. Hand fraying was used next to reduce the 4-cm strip segments down to the middle 2.5 cm of the strips, to ensure close to equal widths of all the strips and because this was the largest size the tensometer would accept. Tensile strength was measured with a Instron 4201 tensile strength machine with 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm clamp teeth spaced 5 cm apart. Measurements were made at lab room temperature (~24 \u00b0C) at 100% humidity attained by saturating the strips with de-ionized water before analysis. Individual strip segment tensile strength loss in kilograms-force was calculated relative to the mean of the reference cotton strips and expressed as a percent. Porewater sampling was done using porewater wells (i.e. 'sippers') installed in each plot following a pilot hole. Wells were constructed as described in . The wells were Teflon tubing (9 mm outer diameter x 6 mm inner diameter) with perforations extending 2.5 cm above and below the sampling depths, and sealed at the bottom with silicone caulk. The top of the wells were capped with a 3-way stopcock which attached to a 30-mL plastic syringe which provided the suction for porewater withdrawal. Sampling took place twice during the growing season, once on May 21 st and 22 nd and again on July 9 th and 10 th , in conjunction with the middle of the two cotton strip deployment set dates. At each date, one 30-mL syringe sample of porewater was extracted from the marsh at each plot. The samples were filtered in the field through a 0.45 \u00b5m uniflow in-line filter and acidified with hydrochloric acid. The clear filtered samples were then used to measure ammonium (NH 4 + ), orthophosphate (PO 4 3-), and hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) concentration in the marsh porewater. Porewater ammonium and orthophosphate (Kuo, 1999) were frozen until analysis using an autoanalyzer. Sulfide was measured the same day as the sample was taken by using an ion specific electrode. Aboveground biomass was sampled during the peak of the growing season in late July 2009, when plants were in the very early stages of senescence.

These effects appear to have been driven by increased nutrient uptake associated with increased above and belowground biomass production as discussed in . Porewater ammonium and phosphate concentrations were the nutrients found to be lower in sites without a canopy (canopy removal and canopy replacement) sites in July. Aboveground plant nitrogen stocks were substantially greater in these treatments, which was driven by greater biomass. This mechanism explains why nutrient effects were not observed early in the growing season (May) as nutrient depletion is not likely until the peak of the growing season (July). An alternative explanation for these nutrient effects is increased denitrification rates due to higher temperatures in sites without a canopy. Higher soil temperatures were observed at sites without a canopy (Miller et al. in review). However, these temperature differences were strongest from mid-April through mid-June and were minimal once the plant canopy had been re-established. If this denitrification mechanism were responsible for the nutrient changes, we should have seen the lower ammonium concentrations in the May set, when temperature gradients between the sites with and without canopies were greater, rather than in the July set, when the temperature gradients were less pronounced. The lowered ammonium and phosphate concentrations in plots without a canopy likely caused the associated depressed decomposition rates. Plant litter decomposition in nutrient poor wetland ecosystems is generally slower than in nutrient-rich wetlands , and higher availability of inorganic nutrients such as ammonium and phosphate to microbial decomposers can increase wetland plant biomass decomposition (Brinson et al., 1981;Mitsch and Gosselink, 2007). These mechanisms are further supported when the data were analyzed separately for sedge-dominated and grass-dominated sites. Sedge-dominated sites with canopy removal had significantly lower decomposition rates from 0 -20 cm in July and also had lower ammonium and almost (P=0.0584) lower phosphate concentrations in the porewater, but no nutrient effects were observed in the grass-dominated sites. These trends match the biomass response of these sites, with sedge-dominated sites showing substantially greater above and belowground biomass in canopy removal sites and grass-dominated sites showing no biomass effects except for a small increase in fine root production . Depthwise analysis of the sedge-dominated sites showed that the decreased decomposition rates from 0 -20 cm was due in large part from the surficial 0 -4 cm zone, where environmental variables are more subject to dynamic change such wetting/drying cycles and daily temperature fluctuations. Porewater sulfide concentrations were also higher in sedge-dominated sites with canopy removal during July, although these concentrations of sulfides were still well below the 1 mM (30 mg H 2 S/L) that has been found to cause plant toxicity in salt marshes ."}, {"section_title": "Lack of ash deposition fertilization effect", "text": "Nutrient additions through ash deposition have been widely suggested as a possible cause for the increased plant productivity frequently observed in marshes following prescribed burns . Several researchers have found that nutrient levels in marsh soils increase following a burn Schmalzer and Hinkle, 1992;). However, plant responses to nutrient additions through ash deposition had not formally been separated out by researchers from the simultaneous effects of canopy removal. Plant dynamics following nutrient additions in marshes have been studied extensively, and are intrinsically tied to other ecosystem process such as organic matter decomposition and nutrient availability (Mendelsshon et al., 1999). Our no burn experiment included the measurement of plant biomass and nutrient content before and after combustion in a controlled setting, which allows for nutrient inputs to be compared to those used in fertilization experiments within coastal marshes. We focused on nitrogen and phosphorus for this comparison because salt marshes are generally nitrogen limited ecosystems , but may exhibit secondary phosphorus limitation . Our sites were likely nitrogen-limited because the nitrogen to phosphorus ratios of both the grass and sedge species analyzed across both of these studies were all less than 12, which is substantially lower than the threshold of 14 that been shown to indicate nitrogen limitation in wetland systems . Nitrogen is used not only as a essential nutrient for photosynthesis, but for the production of amino acids which enable plants to deal with the large osmotic stress induced by high salinities in coastal marshes . Therefore, changes related to increased nitrogen availability may increase primary production at these sites, dependent on other nonnutritive growth limitations. Our examination of the available literature on salt marsh nutrient additions and plant community responses showed that at least 5 g N/m 2 /yr appears to be needed for a plant response to fertilization in marshes, with phosphorus being of secondary, if any, importance ( We can extend our understanding of ash-deposited nutrient additions broadly using a model developed by  for the estimation of post-fire nitrogen loss from cattail and sawgrass vegetation in the Everglades. This model estimates post-burn ash nutrient contents using the equation y=0.01(x 1.46 ) where y = % N loss and x = burn temperature (\u00b0C) (r 2 =0.83). We applied this model using our initial biomass N contents and data from a Crain 2007 study in Spartina patens marshes in Maine and a Gratton and Denno 2003 study in Spartina alterniflora marshes in New Jersey (Fig. 2-12). Based on this analysis, standing plant nutrient stocks do not retain enough nitrogen following prescribed burns to provide N additions above the level (5 g N/m 2 ) found in our literature review to be needed to have a significant effect on biomass. We observed a 90.6% loss of nitrogen in our study, which would equate to a burn temperature of 513 \u00b0C using the Qian et al. 2009 model. Our field measurements of burn temperatures exceeded the ~320 \u00b0C maximum of our IR temperature gun. Our method of outdoor combustion in small bins likely produced higher temperatures than natural ash production during fires due to a concentration of the fuel load. Qian et al. 2009 also developed a model for ash total phosphorus:leaf total phosphorus vs. burn temperature of y=5.96+3.25e 0.004x where y = ashTP:leafTP and x = burn temperature (\u00b0C) (r 2 =0.73). Our observed ratio of ashTP:leafTP of 0.47 represented an unreasonably low burn temperature of approximately 171 \u00b0C, which would have been detected by our temperature gun, and therefore did not agree well with this model. However the authors noted that this relationship between ashTP:leafTP may hold true for only laboratory settings, as phosphorus is lost primarily through the fine particulate pathway, with the volatilization pathway as a relatively minor contributions . Nitrogen is lost through the volatilization pathway and therefore did not present an additional pathway to take into account for our homemade ash samples. The likely explanation for our low ashTP:leafTP ratio is that during the process of ash making in steel bins, convective currents were impossible to keep out and likely removed a significant amount of fine particulate P from our collected ash samples. Further evidence for the absence of a significant ash effect is the timing of burning. Prescribed burning in this region is conducted during the winter months and is typically completed before the beginning of the growing season. During this time, deposited nutrients can be removed through tidal flushing and denitrification. One major limitation to this study was the length. Due to examination of only one growing season worth of data, we cannot confidently say that marshes will always respond as described in this paper."}, {"section_title": "Implications", "text": "Prescribed fire in coastal marshes does not likely provide a fertilization effect for vegetation the following growing season. The lowered ammonium and phosphate concentrations late into the growing season that we observed, likely caused by increased plant biomass uptake of these nutrients in response to canopy removal, probably caused the depression of decomposition rates in the rooting zone from 0 -20 cm by decreasing available nutrients for microbial decomposition. This decrease in decomposition from 0 -20 cm due to lower available nutrients for microbial activity may have positive effects on marsh elevation trajectories.  found that annually burned marshes had lower root zone subsidence than no burned areas (-0.4 \u00b1 1.2 mm/yr vs. -6.2 \u00b1 1.0 mm/yr). This difference is probably associated primarily with increases in belowground root and rhizome production, but could also be influenced by nutrient-related decreases in organic matter decomposition (Mendelsshon et al., 1999)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Through our manipulative study, we found that prescribed fire in coastal marshes does not likely provide a fertilization effect for vegetation through ash deposition due to the low amounts of nutrients remaining in ash following combustion. Also, the ash is applied during the winter, months before peak growing season when nutrients are in high demand. Modeling the biomass nutrient stocks in other marshes with similar vegetation types appears to show that this lack of a fertilization effect likely exists across marsh types. Through the mechanism of canopy removal, organic matter decomposition rates in marsh areas tended to decrease in July but not in May. This decrease in decomposition rates corresponded to a decrease in porewater ammonium and phosphate, which were taken up in much higher quantities in the biomass. Lower available nutrients later in the growing season likely provided resource stress for microbial decomposers, thereby lowering decomposition rates. These effects tended to be stronger and more consistent in areas dominated by the sedge S. americanus, as these areas showed more of a biomass response to canopy removal. Future research efforts should be aimed at coastal marsh fertilization studies with lower nutrient additions, in order to refine our proposed level of 5 g N/m 2 /year as a critical level for plant response. Additionally, longer studies should be carried out (>1 year) investigating the effect of canopy removal on marsh plant-soil relationships so that the findings of this paper may be corroborated over multiple growing seasons.

Two significant three way interactions were observed in the no-burn sites for July, although these difficult relationships were likely not able to tell us any significant ecological information. In high amounts (>1 mM), porewater sulfur may be converted to hydrogen sulfide which may cause toxicity in plants . Porewater sulfide measurements appear to have been more sensitive to treatment effects in this study. Our use of the Unibest PST-1 Resin Capsules in wetlands was a trial run, as these were designed for use in agricultural and upland soils. The exchange surface of the resin became dominated by Na + ions, which are in very high abundance in saltwater. The concentration of these ions were at least one order of magnitude above any other ion measured."}, {"section_title": "Soil Nutrient Cores", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "2) Results and Discussion", "text": "After plotting the resulting values ( Fig. 3-1A&B), it became apparent that either the samples or the methodologies used in analysis were providing erroneous values. For 12 of the 47 sites measured, nitrate readings were greater than 10 mg/L and ammonium readings were greater than 20 mg/L. These results are too high to be accurate, and are likely due to the high organic matter content in the soils analyzed along with the long storage time. These readings are also much higher than what was found in the porewater and resin capsule readings, further indication of the inflated values provided.
