[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "It is known that North Pacific Intermediate Water (NPIW), characterized by a salinity minimum at 26.8\u03c3 \u03b8 , is a major water mass at the intermediate level of the North Pacific [e.g., Reid 1965]. Several studies have suggested that the ventilation source of intermediate water in the North Pacific, including NPIW, is the Sea of Okhotsk [e.g., Talley 1991;Warner et al. 1996]. Over the northwestern shelf in the Sea of Okhotsk, a large amount of sea ice is produced due to severe winds from northeastern Eurasia in winter. The sea ice production leads to production of cold, oxygen-rich dense shelf water (DSW) with densities of up to 27.0\u03c3 \u03b8 [Shcherbina et al. 2003]. The DSW is transported southward into the intermediate layer of the deep Okhotsk basin in the southern Okhotsk Sea, and mixed with intermediate water coming from the North Pacific. This mixing forms the coldest, freshest and oxygen-richest water in the North Pacific in the density range of 26.8-27.4\u03c3 \u03b8 [Talley 1991], which is called Okhotsk Sea Mode Water [Yasuda et al. 1997] or Okhotsk Sea Intermediate Water (OSIW) [Itoh et al. 2003]. The signal of OSIW extends downward to 27.4\u03c3 \u03b8 owing to diapycnal mixing caused by strong tidal currents around the Kuril Straits [Wong et al. 1998]. The OSIW outflows to the North Pacific through the Kuril Straits, mainly Bussol' Strait [Talley 1991], and then mixes with East Kamchatka Current Water, which flows southwestward along the northern Kuril Islands, forming the Oyashio water. The Oyashio water extends to the intermediate layer, flowing southwestward along the Kuril Island chain as the western boundary current of the subarctic gyre. The Oyashio water reaches the confluence of the subtropical and subarctic gyres, and then part of the Oyashio water NAKANOWATARI ET AL.: NORTH PACIFIC WARMING AND O2-DECREASE flows northeastward as the Subarctic Current (SAC), bounding the subarctic gyre on the south. Recently, warming of intermediate water in the Sea of Okhotsk [Hill et al. 2003;Itoh 2006] and decreasing trends of dissolved oxygen content in intermediate water in the Oyashio [Ono et al. 2001] and western subarctic [Andreev and Watanabe 2002;Emerson et al. 2004] "}, {"section_title": "Data and Methods", "text": "Temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen data were mainly taken from the World Ocean Database (WOD01) [Conkright et al. 2002]. In addition, we used observational data obtained by the Japan-Russia-United States international joint study of the Sea of Okhotsk from 1998 to 2004 and data archived by the Japan Oceanographic Data Center. We also used profiling float data obtained by the international Argo program from 2000 to 2004. The data from the recent international project in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Argo project enable us to discuss linear trend of intermediate water mass property until very recently. In this study, we focused on the density range 26.8-27.4\u03c3 \u03b8 , on which the influence of deep water is small and to which winter convection does not directly reach in the open North Pacific [Reid 1965]. These isopycnal surfaces correspond to the intermediate layer influenced by ventilation from the Sea of Okhotsk [Talley 1991;Warner et al. 1998]. Data at discrete depths, mostly from bottle samples, were linearly interpolated to 1 m intervals, and then the values of potential temperature and dissolved oxygen were selected at 0.1\u03c3 \u03b8 intervals. We applied a quality control, resulting in a data set of \u223c63,000 stations at 27.0\u03c3 \u03b8 in the northwestern North Pacific and the Sea of Okhotsk western North Pacific, we produced their climatologies separately. For constructing the gridded data set, we used weighted averaging with a Gaussian window. We chose 150km as a half-width of the window and 75km as an e-folding scale to resolve regional features in the Sea of Okhotsk and the boundary current and fronts in the North Pacific. If the number of observations within the window of the center of a grid box was less than 5, that grid box was regarded as a no-data box. The derived climatologies on each isopycnal surface are quite similar to those of the North Pacific Hydrobase [Macdonald et al. 2001]. A gridded dataset of potential temperature anomalies on isopycnal surfaces was then prepared for the period 1955-2004, and one of dissolved oxygen for the period 1960-2004.  Figure 1b). At 27.2\u03c3 \u03b8 , the magnitude of the linear trend is smaller than that at 27.0\u03c3 \u03b8 , though the spatial pattern is similar. On the other hand, the spatial pattern of the linear trend at 26.8\u03c3 \u03b8 is different from those at 27.0 and 27.2\u03c3 \u03b8 ; warming occurs in the western subarctic gyre, while cooling occurs over the region from the Kuroshio Extension to the south of the subpolar front ( Figure 1a). The cooling trend is consistent with the fact that the significant cooling occurred down to the depth of 400m, which roughly corresponds to the 26.8\u03c3 \u03b8 surface, in the early 1980's [Deser et al. 1996]. The warming trend at 27.0\u03c3 \u03b8 seems to extend along the pathway of the OSIW. Climatology of the acceleration potential at 27.0\u03c3 \u03b8 (Figure 2) Figure 3a shows the time series of temperature anomalies at 27.0\u03c3 \u03b8 for the Sea of Okhotsk, Oyashio and SAC regions ( Figure 2). A positive linear trend is the most significant feature in all three regions.  Itoh [2006]. The magnitude of the warming trend in the other two regions is about half of that. We next examine the linear trend of dissolved oxygen content. For all three regions, significant negative trends are found ( Figure 3b). The decrease of dissolved oxygen is most prominent at 26.9-27.0\u03c3 \u03b8 , where the warming trend is most prominent (Table 1). At 27.0\u03c3 \u03b8 , the linear trend in the Sea of Okhotsk is -0.58\u00b10.34ml/l (significant at 95% confidence interval) for the past 45 years. The Oyashio and SAC regions have the value less than that for the Sea of Okhotsk. It is noted that the oxygen trend difference between the Sea of Okhotsk and Oyashio regions is relatively small when compared to the temperature trend difference between the two regions.  (Figure 1b), to which DSW is transported from the northwestern shelf [Fukamachi et al. 2004]. Therefore, we suppose that the main cause of the warming and oxygen-decreasing trends is the weakening of DSW production. Although reliable estimation of DSW production is not yet available, there is some indirect evidence for a decrease trend in DSW production. Figure 4 shows the time series of surface air temperature anomaly in the cold season averaged over northeastern Eurasia, which is upwind of the Sea of Okhotsk; this air temperature can be an index of sea ice extent. This air temperature has increased considerably during the past 50 years (2.0\u00b11.4 \u2022 C/50-yr, significant at 99% confidence level). Sea ice extent in the Sea of Okhotsk derived from satellite measurements, which is highly correlated with this air temperature (r=-0.61, significant at 95% confidence level), has decreased (-9.2%/27-yr) (Figure 4 [Aota 1999]. These trends of air temperature and sea ice season suggest that sea ice extent, accordingly sea ice production, have likely decreased during the past 50 years. During the current global warming, the surface air temperature anomaly in autumn and winter is particularly large over northeastern Eurasia [Serreze et al. 2000]. The DSW production area of the northwestern shelf in the Sea of Okhotsk is located where the winter monsoon from northeastern Eurasia directly transports cold air masses. Therefore, intermediate water in the Sea of Okhotsk which is ventilated through DSW may be sensitive to the global warming. Several studies showed that most of the North Pacific has freshened in the upper layer recently [Wong et al. 1999;Boyer et al. 2005], which may be also related to the global warming. Also for the Sea of Okhotsk, Hill et al. [2003] reported a possibility of freshening in the upper layer. The freshening in the upper ocean would strengthen the stratification and thus weaken the ventilation or DSW production. Recent studies suggest that OSIW has a significant role in material circulation of the intermediate layer in the North Pacific. Hansell et al. [2002] indicated that dissolved organic carbons in NPIW originate from the Sea of Okhotsk. Nakatsuka et al. [2004] showed that large amounts of dissolved and particulate organic carbons are exported from the highly     Note that in panel a (b) 0.4 \u2022 C (1.0 ml/l) and 0.8 \u2022 C (2.0 ml/l) has been added to the time series for the Oyashio and SAC regions, respectively.

Time series of (a) potential temperature ( \u2022 C) and (b) dissolved oxygen (ml/l) anomalies at 27.0\u03c3 \u03b8 averaged over the Sea of Okhotsk (blue), Oyashio (red), and SAC (green) regions, respectively (see Figure 2 for locations of these three areas). Closed circles show 5-yr averaged anomalies with errors at the 95% confidence interval for the 5-yr averages. Linear regression line for each time series is also indicated by a dashed line.

D is derived from Jones [1994], and the sea ice extent anomaly is derived from the Met Office Hadley Centre's sea ice data set [Rayner et al. 2003]. The surface air temperature anomaly with respect to the 27-yr average from 1979 to 2005 is shown for the benefit of comparison with the sea ice extent anomaly."}, {"section_title": "D R A F T", "text": "March 15, 2007, 10:25am D R A F T"}]
