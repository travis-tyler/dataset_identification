[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In Fall 2015, protests at about 60 college campuses across the U.S. brought new attention to demands and initiatives focused on increasing faculty diversity (e.g., [1][2][3][4][5][6]). The movement put a spotlight on the underrepresentation of historically marginalized groups and the lack of progress made to redress these issues. Women continue to be severely underrepresented among STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematical science) faculty [7] and \"faculty of color remain underrepresented and their achievements in the academy almost invisible\" [8]. In recent years there has been great concern about the \"revolving door for underrepresented minority faculty\" [9][10][11], with evidence for the view that retention is at least as important as recruitment [12]. Moreno et al. [9] found that nearly three in five new URM faculty hired went to replace URM faculty who had left the institution. Concerning women, Thomas et al. [13] constructed stochastic models to demonstrate that faculty composition will never converge to parity unless recruiting, retention, and promotion to full professor are equal to men's. Recruiting, retention, and career progression must all be increased in order to reverse under-representation of women and minority faculty in science and engineering faculties [14]. In 2012 Kaminski and Geisler [15] reported that retention rates and time to promotion for women faculty were similar to men in STEM disciplines. This differs from the many reports (e.g, [16,17]) of the leaky pipeline for women at all stages of an academic career. Kaminiski and Geisler did find that women leave the tenure track earlier than men in mathematics. Xu [18] demonstrated that faculty turnover can vary greatly among disciplines. Taylor and Froyd [19] estimated survival rates for women in engineering at Texas A&M almost 20 percentage points lower than for men. Box-Steffensmeier et al. [20], studying faculty in the social sciences, found no difference in retention between women and men, but did find that men have a higher chance of being promoted from assistant to associate professor than women. These reports raise two important questions: (1) how variable are results among different disciplines and institutions, and (2) how do retention and promotion rates for URM faculty compare to rates of other faculty?. This study investigates faculty retention and time to promotion by race and by gender within STEM disciplines using institutional data for all tenure track assistant and associate professors hired in these disciplines at four large land grant universities categorized as highest research activity doctoral granting institutions. Land grant institutions employ a substantial fraction of all tenured and tenure track faculty in the U.S., 16% in 2015 [21]."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data, definitions and outcomes", "text": "We use institutional data for all faculty hired into tenure track assistant professor positions in STEM disciplines at four institutions, labeled LG1-LG4 (2,077 individual faculty, Table 1), and all tenured and tenure-track faculty hired or promoted to associate professor appointments in STEM disciplines (1,793 individuals, Table 2). Previous studies [15,20][22], relied upon publicly-available CVs, websites and catalogs. We define STEM as all departments within the subfields of the agricultural sciences and natural resources, the biological and biomedical sciences, the physical and mathematical sciences, and engineering in line with the 2014 Survey of Earned Doctorates [22]. Black or African American, Hispanic/Latino and American Indian faculty are included in the underrepresented (URM) faculty group. The number of years of available data varied among the institutions; time to promotion/tenure or time to exit were available for each faculty member hired or appointed from 1992-2015 for LG1 and LG2, 1997-2015 for LG3, and 2002-2015 for LG4. For faculty hired from 2002-2015, we report three outcomes for each institution and for each discipline group (agricultural sciences and natural resources, biological and biomedical sciences, physical and mathematical sciences, and engineering) by gender and race/ethnicity group. The outcomes are 1. Proportion of assistant professors exiting without tenure, 2. Survival functions of those originally hired as assistant professors, 3.

Cumulative incidence curves provide summary information on survival in the presence of competing risks. There are two ways that an assistant professor might leave the assistant professor rank: (1) by leaving the institution while still a pre-tenure assistant professor, or (2) by obtaining tenure and promotion to associate professor. These two possibilities are mutually exclusive outcomes; one precludes the other. In the language of survival analysis, these two outcomes are competing risks. The event of interest in this study is the event of leaving the university while still an assistant professor, before taking up a tenured associate professor position. Faculty who were still pre-tenure assistant professors in 2015, the last year for which data were available, or had died while an assistant professor were considered censored. Cumulative incidence curves for men and women and for URM vs other faculty were compared using Gray's test [24]. The cumulative incidence curves were fitted separately for each institution; however, if the differences between demographic groups showed similar patterns for all four institutions, the four institutions' tests for differences by gender and race/ethnicity were combined by stratification. Because the numbers of URM faculty are small, the statistical tests do not have much power. Note that it is not possible to distinguish between faculty who did not apply for tenure, those who applied but were not granted tenure and those who were granted tenure in the summer but opted to leave the institution before the new rank took effect the following fall semester; all of these cases appear in the data as faculty who left without tenure."}, {"section_title": "Faculty retention", "text": "Life table survival estimates for time until exiting the university at any rank were computed for all faculty who were appointed as tenure track assistant professor positions at each institution Time to promotion from associate professor to professor Cumulative incidence curves [23] were constructed to estimate the probability of promotion from associate to full professor according to time in rank. In this case, the competing risks are (1) promotion to full professor, and (2) leaving the institution while still an associate professor. The event of interest was the time to promotion to full professor, the competing event is exiting the institution while an associate professor, and faculty who remained at the university but had not been promoted by 2015 or who died while serving as associate professor were considered censored.

For these institutions, multiracial faculty were not included in the URM group because many are Asian/White or other non-URM faculty. URM status was determined for all faculty regardless of citizenship or visa status. However, at one of the institutions, race and ethnicity were not reported for international faculty, so international faculty were not considered URM for that institution."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Hiring demographics over time", "text": "Appointments to tenure track assistant professor positions in STEM disciplines generally increased for underrepresented minorities over time, reaching 10 to 11 percent at the four institutions in 2007-2011, but declining in the most recent cohort. The gains in hiring differed among ethnic and racial groups ( Table 3). Most of the increases came as a result of hiring Hispanic/Latino faculty. Black faculty constituted no more than 2% of tenure track assistant professors hired from 2002-2015 at three of the four institutions studied. American Indian faculty hiring was less than 1% at all of the institutions. Hispanic hiring increased substantially across cohorts, making up 5-6% of tenure track assistant professor hires from 2002-2015. The proportion of tenure track assistant professor positions that went to women increased over time at three of the four institutions, reaching 27-28% in the most recent time period. At LG2 the female share of appointments was substantially higher in all time periods, ranging from 32% to 37% over the entire 1997-2015 time frame. At that institution, women are more highly represented in the biological and agricultural sciences than at other institutions, but there are very few women in engineering (Table 4)."}, {"section_title": "Women's probability of leaving without tenure", "text": "At all four institutions, the final probability of leaving without tenure was similar for men and women in the 2002-2015 cohort (Table 5) when all STEM disciplines are pooled together, although the shape of the cumulative incidence curves for men and women were significantly different at one of the institutions (LG4, p-value = .09), with women leaving earlier than men, particularly in the 5 th year. In contrast, the fraction of women who left without tenure in the 1997-2001 cohort was much higher than that of men. At the three institutions for which we have data for faculty hired between 1997 and 2001, 37%, 36% and 44% of those female assistant professors left without tenure, while 21%, 28% and 22%, respectively, of male assistant professors left without tenure. *Note that faculty may identify with more than one racial/ethnic category, so the totals may be larger than the percent of URM faculty reported in Table 1. \u2020 Note that this is a period of 14 years, whereas the first two columns are cohorts of 5 years each. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0187285.t003 Disaggregating the data by discipline reveals differences among disciplines in the size of gap, or lack of a gap, between men and women (Fig 1). In Engineering, women were more likely to leave without tenure than men (Fig 1). The estimated probability of leaving without tenure for women in Engineering is 33%, but for men is 26%. The difference in incidence of leaving is largest in year five; in year five 11% of women are estimated to leave, compared with 2% of men. We do not see differences between women and men in the other three groups of disciplines (Fig 1)."}, {"section_title": "Probability of URM faculty exiting prior to tenure", "text": "In the 2002-2015 cohort, URM faculty were less likely to leave without tenure than other faculty at three of the four institutions (Table 6), though these differences were not statistically significant. At LG3, however, URM faculty were more likely (50% vs 25%) to leave without tenure than other faculty, again not statistically significant. It is important to note that the numbers of URM faculty that have been hired and that have been in rank long enough to have been considered for promotion to associate professor are very small in these disciplines at all four institutions, ranging from 20 to 39 faculty hired over the 14-year period. Hence, the estimated probability of leaving for URM faculty is not very precise and the confidence intervals are wide. Among URM faculty hired at LG3 from 2002-2015, eight faculty actually left without tenure, 11 faculty were granted tenure, and 17 URM faculty were hired too recently to have been considered for tenure yet ( Table 7). Looking at the previous cohort further demonstrates how difficult it is to make statements about patterns based on small numbers. In the 1997-2001 cohort all six assistant professors hired stayed on as associate professors with tenure at LG3. Data collected for this study do not support findings on whether climate at LG3 changed https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0187285.g001 Table 6.

In the biological and biomedical sciences and in the physical and mathematical sciences, no URM assistant professors hired in the 2002-2015 time frame left without tenure (Table 8).

Kaminski and Geisler [15] reported a median time to departure of 10.9 years for assistant professors hired between 1990 and 2002 in a subset of STEM disciplines at 14 institutions. At the four institutions in our study, retention times were much longer than those reported by Kaminsky and Geisler for most categories of faculty. To compare, we used our first two cohorts, covering faculty hired from 1992-2001. During this time period data were available for three institutions. Two institutions submitted data covering the period of 1992-2001, with the third institution's coverage periods spanning 1997-2001. Using these time periods, the median time to departure for women was 19 years at one institution and 11 years at another. At the third institution, 55% of female faculty were estimated to stay longer than 23 years, which was as far as our dataset extended. The median time to departure could not be estimated for men at any of the three institutions, meaning that a majority of men stayed at the institution longer than the number of years of available data, which in this case ranged from 14 to 23 years. We use two sets of cohorts to compare faculty retention across gender and race/ethnicity. The 2002-2006 cohort, which is available for all four institutions, provides a snapshot of the proportions of faculty who have stayed at the institution for ten years or more. The 2002-2015 cohorts provide additional information on the behavior of recently hired faculty who have Table 7.

In Engineering, women are at higher risk of leaving than men, particularly in years 3 through 7 (Fig 3).

The introduction posed the question of how variable results are among different disciplines and institutions. We found that faculty retention and time to promotion for women vary substantially among disciplines. Female engineering faculty who started as assistant professors had higher incidence of leaving than men, particularly in years 3 through 7, and left without tenure more frequently than men. We did not see this discrepancy in the other disciplines. On the other hand, time to promotion from associate to full professor averages one to two years longer for women than for men in the biological, biomedical and agricultural sciences and natural resources, but no differences in time to promotion by gender appear in the physical and mathematical sciences and engineering. The four institutions in this study are very similar by several measures; they are all classified as highest research activity doctoral granting land grant institutions. Yet even among this homogeneous set of institutions and disciplines within the sciences and engineering, there is some variability among institutions, though not as large in magnitude as the differences among disciplines. At LG4, but not at the other institutions, female assistant professors were not retained at the institution as long as men. Institutions or discipline groups wishing to understand the experiences of women in their fields or institutions and to draw conclusions about needs to be met or action steps to take, should be aware of these differences and make discipline-specific or institution-specific estimates. The second question posed in the introduction was how retention and promotion rates for URM faculty compare to rates for other faculty. Although the focus of this paper is faculty retention rather than hiring, the low number of URM faculty at the four institutions under study affects the conclusions that we are able to draw and our understanding about how to address issues of representation in higher education. The small numbers prevent us from making conclusions about retention for African American/black, Hispanic/Latino, or American Indian faculty specifically, but the hiring data show some striking differences among racial/ethnic groups. Black or African American faculty have not been hired in as large proportions as earn doctorates, but Hispanic and American Indian faculty are being hired in approximately the same proportions as earn Ph.D.s in STEM disciplines. Further studies are needed to understand differences in hiring patterns, promotion and retention for specific underrepresented racial/ethnic groups. Notably, all URM faculty hired as assistant professors from 2002-2015 in the biological and biomedical sciences or the physical and mathematical sciences earned tenure at their institutions. Because of the small numbers of URM faculty and resulting low power, no statistically significant differences were found in the incidence of leaving without tenure between URM faculty and other faculty at any institution, though at three of the four institutions smaller fractions of URM faculty left without tenure than other faculty. The picture for overall retention of URM faculty who started as assistant professors is more mixed. At two of the institutions in our study, significantly higher fractions of URM faculty than other faculty left the institution within ten years of hire. The biological, biomedical, physical and mathematical sciences are again notable: all URM faculty in these disciplines stayed at their institutions ten years or more. At the associate professor stage, no large differences in time to promotion from associate to full professor were discernable. Understanding the specific patterns within a discipline or an institution is important for those wishing to evaluate or address disparities. It is also important to understand the large impact that departures of a few URM STEM faculty can have in an institution or discipline where the community is already very small. Our general conclusion is that URM faculty representation is so low that it limits our understanding of faculty retention and success. We did not have the statistical power to discern many differences and did not find consistent differences in career progression between URM faculty and other faculty. We found that in some disciplines URM faculty are retained at higher rates than other faculty, but also found some cases of specific institutions where URM retention is lower than other faculty."}]
