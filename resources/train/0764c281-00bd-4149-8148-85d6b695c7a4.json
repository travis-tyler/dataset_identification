We investigated the association between obesity and prostate volume, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and PSA density among 753 men referred for prostate biopsy. Among men with a negative biopsy, prostate volume significantly increased approximately 25% from the lowest to highest body mass index (BMI), waist or hip circumference or height categories.

Our data suggest that obesity and height are independently associated with prostate volume."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Most men after the fifth decade experience symptoms or have histology consistent with prostate growth and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). 1 The prevalence of obesity and abdominal adipose deposition also increases with age 2, 3 and changes in steroid hormone metabolism, insulin regulation, or SHBG levels associated with aging and prostatic enlargement may be accelerated with obesity. 3 However, results from research investigating the association between body mass index (BMI) 4, 5 or estimated visceral adiposity 4, 6 and clinically diagnosed BPH are inconsistent. Investigation of prostate volume or prostate weight may avoid subjective diagnostic criteria associated with a BPH diagnosis, and several recent studies reported BMI associated with prostate volume 7, 8 and prostate weight. 9 However, BMI was not associated with prostate volume in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. 10 Although visceral adiposity 4, 6 and height 11 have been associated with clinical BPH, little is known about their relationships with prostate volume.\nFurthermore, several recent studies suggest that any effect of obesity on prostate volume may also have an effect on prostate cancer detection. Prostate cancer may be more difficult to detect as prostate volume increases, 12, 13 leading to un-or under-diagnosed prostate cancer among obese men with a greater prostate volume.\nIncreased prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing 14, 15 and somewhat lower blood PSA levels associated with BMI, 16, 17 and differential prostate cancer detection with respect to obesity as mediated by effects on prostate volume may also contribute to inconsistencies in research investigating the association between obesity and prostate cancer risk.\nFurther understanding the nature of the association between body size and prostate enlargement may identify a modifiable risk factor for many common lower urinary tract symptoms, and also may contribute to the epidemiologic investigation of obesity and prostate cancer. Here, we investigate the associations between BMI, waist and hip circumferences, the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and height on prostate volume, PSA levels and PSA density.

Spearman's correlation coefficients were calculated to describe the association between different body size measures. The primary analytic approach compared mean PSA or prostate volume across categories of each body size measure defined by the WHO criteria (BMI) or at quartile values of each distribution. PSA, prostate volume and PSA density data were natural log transformed before analysis. Mean PSA, volume and density scores across body size categories were adjusted for age, race (black/ white), number of prior PSA tests, a positive DRE and the number of biopsy cores collected within a multivariable linear regression model (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Additional analyses added the remaining body size measures to this model. Tests for trend in adjusted PSA, prostate volume, or PSA density scores across body size categories were determined by the significance of a variable for each body size categorization in a multivariable linear regression model.

Most subjects had two or more PSA tests before biopsy (n \u00bc 429, 57.0%), approximately 33% (n \u00bc 249) had a positive indication at DRE, and 69 subjects were using an alpha1 adrenergic receptor blocker. A 12-core biopsy protocol was common (45.7%), and pathologic review from biopsy led to the diagnosis of 112 high-grade cancer cases, 153 low-grade cancer cases, 108 PIN cases and 380 biopsy-negative subjects. These factors were significantly associated with PSA, prostate volume, or PSA density.\nApproximately 20.7% (n \u00bc 156) of subjects had a BMI o25; 49.4% (n \u00bc 372) had a BMIX25 and o30; 23.4% (n \u00bc 176) had a BMIX30 and o35 and 6.5% (n \u00bc 49) and a BMIX35. Among men with a negative biopsy or a lowgrade cancer, prostate volume was approximately 25 or 72% greater among subjects with a BMI435kg/m 2 compared with o25, respectively (P-trendo0.01) ( Table 2 ). In contrast, PSA and prostate volume did not significantly vary with BMI within PIN subjects. However, BMI was marginally associated with a lower prostate volume among men diagnosed with high-grade cancer (P-trend \u00bc 0.08). PSA density generally decreased with increasing BMI, although no trends reached statistical significance.\nWaist circumference and other body size measures were categorized at the quartile values of each distribution. Similar to BMI, prostate volume was approximately 28 and 19% greater among biopsy-negative and lowgrade cancer subjects with the highest waist or hip circumferences, respectively (P-trendso0.01) ( Table 2) . Also, prostate volume increased 26% with hip circumference within PIN cases (P-trend \u00bc 0.05). Accordingly, waist and hip circumferences were associated with lower PSA density scores within biopsy-negative and PIN groups. The WHR was significantly associated with a 16% increase in PSA levels, and a 20% increase in prostate volume, within biopsy-negative subjects. However, PSA density significantly increased with WHR only within PIN cases (a 17% increase). Height was associated with greater prostate volume across all groups, with significant trends within high-grade cancer subjects and ; P-trendo0.01), and blood PSA levels remained significantly associated with increasing WHR among biopsy-negative subjects (4.3, 5.0, 6.2, 6.3 ng/ml; P-trend \u00bc 0.03). Other previously significant trends between body size and prostate volume were not significant.\nWe explored the association between PSA, prostate volume and PSA density against self-reported weight at ages 18, 30, and 50 years. The correlation between past weight and current body size increases as past age approaches the present age (BMI: r s \u00bc 0.23, 0.39, 0.62; waist: r s \u00bc 0.24, 0.37, 0.61; hip: r s \u00bc 0.32, 0.46, 0.68; height: r s \u00bc 0.37, 0.39, 0.37; WHR: r s \u00bc 0.03, 0.07, 0.20; for weight at ages 18, 30 and 50 years, respectively). Past weight was categorized at tertiles of each distribution (Table 3 ) and in analyses that adjusted for current BMI and other listed factors, greater weight at each age was significantly associated with prostate volume among biopsy-negative subjects. Additional adjustment for all current height, waist and hip circumferences and WHR found weight at ages 18 and 30 years significantly associated with prostate volume (all P-trendo0.01), whereas weight at age 50 years was no longer significantly associated with prostate volume (P-trend \u00bc 0.08)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We investigated the association between body size and PSA levels or prostate volume among subjects with a negative biopsy, PIN, low-grade cancer and high-grade cancer.

After controlling for all body size measures in a multivariable model, BMI and height were most consistently associated with prostate volume. Only WHR within biopsy-negative subjects was significantly associated with PSA levels. Among PIN and low-grade cancer cases, greater body size was generally associated with greater prostate volume; however, associations were significant only with BMI and waist and hip circumferences within the low-grade cancer subjects. Among high-grade cases, height was significantly associated with a larger prostate volume, whereas a nonsignificant decrease in prostate volume was associated with BMI. Our observation for an association between obesity or height and prostate volume are consistent with several studies evaluating prostate size or clinical BPH. 4, 6, 9, 11 For example, Freedland et al. 9 reported prostate weight was about 5 g greater among prostate cancer patients (70.2%\nwith Gleason sum o7) with a BMI between 30 and 35kg/ m 2 compared to a BMI less than 25kg/m 2 (42.2 vs 37.4 g, respectively). Our analyses found body size measures associated with a greater prostate size among both biopsy-negative and low-grade cancer cases, and BMI and height were most clearly associated with prostate volume in a secondary analysis that controlled for the other measurements. Estrogens have long been associated with prostate hyperplasia in animal models, 18, 19 and estrogen levels increase with obesity through CYP19 (aromatase) conversion of androgens in adipose tissue. Alternatively, growth hormone levels, in part, responsible for attained height also affect insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and IGF-binding protein levels. 20 Indeed, prostate volume significantly associated with IGFBP3 levels independent of age and BMI in the Flint Men's Health Study. 8 The rate of prostate enlargement increases more rapidly as prostate size increases, 21 and our exploratory analyses describing a significant association Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index; PIN, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia; PSA, prostate-specific antigen; WHR, waist-to-hip ratio. *Geometric mean values adjusted for age, race, number of prior PSA tests (o2 or X2), positive DRE, number of cores at biopsy (o12 or X12).

Trends remained significant after additional adjustment for other body size measures in Table 2 (biopsy-negative subject: (prostate volume and BMI (P-trend \u00bc 0.04); waist (P-trend \u00bc 0.94) hip (P-trend \u00bc 0.84), WHR (P-trend \u00bc 0.26, height: (P-trendo0.01); PSA and WHR (P-trend \u00bc 0.03)); PIN (prostate volume and hip (P-trend \u00bc 0.11); low-grade (prostate volume and BMI (P-trend \u00bc 0.89), waist: (P-trend \u00bc 0.40), hip (P-trend \u00bc 0.80), height (P-trend \u00bc 0.18); high-grade (prostate volume and BMI (P-trend \u00bc 0.26), height (P-trend \u00bc 0.08)).\nObesity and prostate volume JH Fowke et al between reported weight at ages 18 and 30 years, independent of current BMI or height, suggest weight during young adulthood is relevant to prostate growth in men without identified prostate cancer or PIN. The body size and prostate volume association was most clearly observed within the biopsy-negative group. Reasons for variation between biopsy-negative and cancer/PIN groups in this association are highly speculative, but may involve the potential role of body size in prostate carcinogenesis and prostate cancer risk, or detection biases related to prostate volume. The relationship between obesity and prostate carcinogenesis is controversial, 22 but to the extent that obesity advances prostate carcinogenesis independent of prostate volume the association between obesity and prostate volume among cancer cases would be more difficult to identify. Cancer usually involves only a small fraction of the total gland, and proportionately smaller tissue is collected from a large prostate at biopsy, decreasing the chance of sampling from the cancer site(s). 12, 13 This may be particularly true for high-grade cancer, which often represents only a fraction of the total cancer content. Thus, the negative biopsy group favors men who may be most susceptible to prostate enlargement, and perhaps the effects of obesity on prostate volume may be more easily detected within this group. In contrast, subjects who may not be susceptible to the effects of obesity on prostate volume are more likely to have a smaller prostate, and perhaps more likely to be diagnosed with cancer in the presence of an elevated PSA. Within cancer patients, those subjects most susceptible to the effects of obesity on prostate enlargement would be preferentially diagnosed with low-grade disease. Identifying those susceptible, and the magnitude of any cancer detection biases, will require investigating the endocrine biomarkers linking obesity to prostate volume.\nIn healthy populations, a BMI430kg/m 2 was associated with 0.1-0.4 ng/ml lower PSA levels. 16, 17, 23 Studies investigating the effects of BMI among men with elevated PSA consistent with biopsy referral have not shown a clear relationship. 9 Overall, the association between body size and PSA density appears to be attributable to the relationships between body size and prostate volume. However, we found a modest increase in average PSA levels across WHR categories, about 0.7 ng/ml, among biopsy-negative subjects. Lower PSA levels with elevated hemoglobin (Hb)A1c levels also were recently reported in a research abstract analyzing NHANES data, 24 perhaps suggesting an interaction between insulin regulation or the metabolic syndrome and PSA expression is relevant in men with elevated PSA. 25 Strengths of this study include a high recruitment rate and the collection of multiple body size measurements using standardized protocols. All body measurements were collected before prostate biopsy to avoid any weight change that may follow diagnosis. We removed subjects using 5-alpha reductase inhibitors from the analysis, and past prostate cancer screening practices potentially associated differential healthcare with respect to obesity were controlled for in the analysis. Also, all subjects had healthcare access and had a PSA test, reducing the opportunity for selection biases associated with preferential PSA testing practices with respect to obesity. Furthermore, prostate cancer is a highly prevalent disease, 26 but our biopsy-negative subjects were less likely to harbor latent cancer or PIN compared with a general population sample.\nGeneralizability of our results to other populations may be a limitation. However, the BMI and waist circumference distributions in this study were consistent with NHANES data for the US population of men over 40 years of age, 27 suggesting that study participants did not have unusual levels of obesity. Similarly, subjects involved in our exploratory analyses of past lifetime weight had a similar age (P \u00bc 0.82), PSA (P \u00bc 0.24), prostate volume (P \u00bc 0.31) and PSA density (P \u00bc 0.32) as subjects without lifetime weight data. Furthermore, Obesity and prostate volume JH Fowke et al random or systematic errors in reporting past weight may limit these exploratory analyses. Confirmation of self-reported weight history is not always possible; however, we found reported weight increased with age and approached measured weight at time of recruitment, as would be expected. Our sample size at present would not support investigating potential age modification of the body size and prostate volume/PSA associations within each study group. Also, clinical TRUS is not a goldstandard measure, but TRUS estimates are strongly correlated with prostate weight at surgery. 28 "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Obesity and height were significantly associated with greater prostate volume, particularly among men with a negative biopsy.
