This morphological transition to a more elongated shape with progression south is a characteristic that is also observed in other regional pockmark fields (e.g. Blue Hill Bay, ME; Passamaquoddy Bay, New Brunswick, Canada) and is suggested to be related to increased uni-directional, near-bed flow (Brothers, et al., 2012). I Methane-escape from Holocene estuarine sediment has been evoked as the primarily mechanism of pockmark formation in Belfast Bay based on multiple geophysical data observations of shallow natural gas within this sediment package (Bamhardt et al., 1997;Christian, 2000;Andrews et al., 2010). Historical bathymetric data dating back to 1872 document the presence of multiple pockmarks within Belfast Bay and suggest that at least a portion of the field existed about 140 years ago. Furthermore, the Belfast Bay pockmarks do not protrude below the Pleistocene/Holocene unconformity and are therefore suggested to be no older than 11,000 years. The present degassing activity within Belfast Bay remains controversial with evidence existing both for (e.g. Kelly et al., 1994;Bamhardt et al, 1997) and against (Ussier et al., 2003)  within the Belfast Bay pockmark field (e.g. Kelley, et al., 1994;Ussier, et al., 2003;Rogers et a l, 2006;Andrews, et al., 2010), none have investigated the flow stmcture and circulation patterns in the vicinity of these pockmarks. Analysis of the flow and sediment dynamics around pockmarks will lead to a better understanding of micro-scale pockmark evolution in Belfast Bay as well as provide valuable insight regarding the required frequency of repeat hydrographic surveys to properly characterize the regional bathymetry.

These crater-like features are distributed in a variety of global geologic environments ranging from shallow coastal regions {e.g., Brothers et al., 2011;Wildish et al., 2008), to deep offshore settings {e.g., Hovland and Judd, 1988;Hovland and Svensen, 2006). Pockmarks range in size from less than 1 m to over a kilometer in diameter and are believed to be formed by the gradual or instantaneous release of underlying gas, groundwater, or pore-water {e.g., Scanlon and Knebel, 1989;Christodoulou, et al., 2003). A major source of uncertainty in pockmark research relates to age estimation and mechanisms for long-term maintenance, specifically in non-actively venting fields. Observations of the current structure as well as the physical properties of the water column within and around these depressions are needed to improve our understanding of sediment transport within pockmarks. These observations will better constrain models for age approximation and offer insight into mechanisms of post-formation pockmark maintenance. In addition, many pockmark fields are associated with abundant biological communities within individual pockmarks (e.g., Gay, et a l, 2005;Hovland, et al., 2005;Ritt, et al., 2011;Wildish, et al. 2008), and investigation of current flow in the vicinity of pockmarks will lead to more accurate estimations of faunal and nutrient distribution patterns in these seafloor depressions.\nPockmarks are crater-like depressions in the seafloor that are globally distributed and ubiquitous in nearshore environments (e.g., Kelley, et al., 1994). These depressions are believed to form from fluid and gas escape from underlying, unconsolidated sediment and range in size from a few meters to several kilometers in diameter (Hovland and Judd, 1988). The interaction of currents with seafloor depressions is poorly understood, but is of primary importance to circulation, mixing, and sediment transport within pockmarks. Current observations in the vicinity of pockmarks will improve ecological models that estimate faunal and nutrient dispersion patterns around pockmarks as well as better constrain sedimentation and erosion rate estimations within and around these prominent seafloor features. Three previous studies have investigated current circulation within pockmarks. Manley, et al. (2004) conducted a long-term field study over a nearly circular pockmark with length-to-depth ratio (L/D) of approximately 10 in Burlington Bay, Vermont. Observations of strong, upward-directed vertical velocity events and flow recirculation within the pockmark are suggested to be consistent with back-eddy formation or the development of a cyclostrophic flow within the pockmark. Three-dimensional numerical modeling completed by Hammer, et al. (2009) examined current flow over a pockmark (L/D -5.7) with similar dimensions to those found naturally in the Inner Oslofjord, Norway pockmark field. Modeled results showed contour-following currents with strong upward-directed velocities in the center and along the downstream edge of the pockmark that conceptually agreed with the cyclostrophic flow model proposed by Manley, et al. (2004). Brothers, et al. (2011b) numerically modeled incompressible flow over a simplified pockmark in two and three dimensions. Their results show both contourfollowing and recirculating flow patterns within the pockmark as the relative length-todepth ratio of the pockmark is altered and indicate that pockmark flow circulation is strongly influenced by the geometry of the depression. In Chapter 2 of this thesis, we described field observations obtained in two pockmarks in Belfast Bay, Maine. These observations indicate active mixing and overturning throughout the pockmarks and the influence of roughness-induced form drag on the overall flow structure. This study investigates the relationship between pockmark geometry and internal circulation patterns using the same field observations obtained along the rim and center of the two sampled pockmarks (Figure 3-1). Belfast Bay is located in the northwestern Gulf of Maine and is characterized by an extensive pockmark field in a shallow, estuarine environment with tidally-driven currents. Greater complexity in flow structure is observed over the northern pockmark due to converging tidal currents around Islesboro Island . The closer proximity of the southern pockmark to the narrow channel to the west of Islesboro Island results in more tidally-driven, unidirectional flow over the pockmark. This paper shows that a conceptual open cavity flow model (Ashcroft and Zhang, 2005) qualitatively predicts recirculation patterns within the two sampled pockmarks in Belfast Bay. \nPockmarks are large, circular to elongate seafloor depressions and are globally distributed in a wide-range of settings including estuaries (Scanlon and Knebel, 1989;Bamhardt, et a i, 1997), lakes (Pickrill, 2006;Manley, et al., 2004), and offshore environments (King and MacLean, 1970;Pauli, et al., 2002). Pockmarks range in size from a few meters to several kilometers in diameter and form from a sudden or gradual release of fluid and gas from underlying sediment (Judd and Hovland, 2007). In minimally-venting pockmark fields, flow-induced turbulence and low sediment input are typically invoked as mechanisms of post-formation pockmark maintenance, yet few studies have numerically modeled current flow within pockmarks (e.g., Hammer, et al., 2009;Brothers, et al., 2011b) or obtained physical measurements within these depressions (e.g., Manley, et al., 2004). Field observations and numerical modeling of current flow over a spherical pockmark (Hammer, et al., 2009) indicate upwelling and flow recirculation within the depression that is qualitatively consistent with a theoretical model proposed by Manley, et al. (2004). The model describes the formation of a cyclostrophic rotational flow within the pockmark due to the elongation of the water column over the depression. This circulation pattern may prevent the settling of fine-grained material within the pockmark (Hammer, et al., 2009), which is consistent with observations of coarser-grained deposits within the center of many pockmarks (e.g. Manley, et al., 2004;Webb, et al., 2009). A subsequent study (Brothers, et al.,  This study examines hydrodynamic processes and sediment properties within and around two pockmarks in Belfast Bay using field observations of currents and sediment characteristics obtained within the center and along the rim of these depressions during a rising high tide (Figure 4.1). Belfast Bay is located in the northwestern Gulf of Maine, approximately 20 km southwest of the Penobscot River (346 m V mean discharge; PEARL, 2011) and is characterized as a shallow, estuarine environment. Pockmark morphology in Belfast Bay varies from more circular in the north to more elongated in the south where the bay constricts in width from 8.5 km to 2.6 km. Evidence exists both for and against an actively venting pockmark field in Belfast Bay. Observations of acoustic turbidity (Brothers, et al., 2011a), sidewall angles in excess of the angle of repose (Brothers, et al., 2011b), and material being ejected from a pockmark (Kelley, et al., 1994) provide evidence for actively degassing pockmarks in Belfast Bay. However, a recent geochemical survey of Belfast Bay reported no evidence of active methane or pore-fluid excavation and concluded that the Belfast Bay pockmarks may be inactive (Ussier, et al., 2003). This paper shows that flow-induced stress may act to modify the Belfast Bay pockmarks in conjunction with, or in the absence of natural gas and pore-  "}, {"section_title": "Belfast Bay is located in central Maine in the northwestern quadrant of Penobscot", "text": "Bay and consists of an extensive pockmark field ( Figure 2-1) (Scanlon and Knebel, 1989). Belfast Bay is characterized as a shallow 10-50 m deep, estuarine environment with predominant fresh-water input by the small Passagassawakeag River to the northwest and the larger Penobscot River to the northeast (USGS, 2010). Belfast Bay contains over 1,700 pockmarks within a 25 km2 area (Andrews, et al., 2010). Pockmark morphology transitions from a nearly circular shape in the shallower, northern region to a more elongated shape in the deeper, southern region. Biogenically derived methane release from Holocene estuarine mud has been identified as the primary method of pockmark formation in Belfast Bay, yet the relative degassing activity and maintenance mechanisms of the pockmarks remain unresolved (Kelley, et al., 1994). Although much research has addressed pockmark formation, specifically in Belfast Bay (e.g., Scanlon and Knebel, 1989;Kelley, et a l, 1994;Rogers, et al., 2006;Brothers, et al., 2012), few studies have acquired physical current or temperature measurements in the vicinity of pockmarks. This study presents field observations of the evolution of the vertical temperature, salinity, and current structure over two pockmarks in Belfast Bay, Maine.

This mixing event is similar in character to observations reported by Manley, et al. (2004) of overturning within a pockmark in Burlington Bay, Lake Champlain, Vermont. They observed increased wind stress at the surface that resulted in rapid cooling of the entire water column due to the replacement of warm, surface water by cold, deep water. This decrease in temperature was associated with strong negative vertical velocities that circulated water throughout the pockmark to create a homogeneous profile. These observations of temperature changes above and below the rim of sampled pockmarks occurring concurrently with strong vertical velocity events indicate active mixing and overturning within these depressions. Further evidence for mixing within pockmarks is provided by observations of strong upwelling and downwelling events that extended from above the rim down into the pockmark (Figure 2-8). Highest magnitude vertical velocities (order 0.15 m/s) typically occur slightly below the rim of the pockmark, presumably due to innerpockmark circulation patterns. These vertical velocity observations are similar to numerically modeled results of flow over a pockmark obtained by Hammer, et al. (2009). They observed highest vertical velocities within the modeled pockmark that decreased in magnitude towards the surface and were induced by the geometry of the depression. These strong vertical velocity observations within the sampled and previously modeled pockmarks suggest internal pockmark mixing is most likely enhanced by pockmark geometry.\nCurrent structure is subdivided into three distinct layers at upper, mid, and deep regions marked by the average depth of the thermocline and the depth of the rim ( Conversely, the proximity of the southern pockmark to the narrow channel to the west of Islesboro Island results in more unidirectional, tidally-driven current observations."}, {"section_title": "Form Drag", "text": "Individual horizontal velocity profiles over each pockmark were investigated to assess the influence of pockmark geometry on the local flow structure. Current velocities past large roughness elements are often retarded due to contributions from skin friction and form drag. Skin friction refers to the tangential stress at the boundary, whereas form drag results from pressure differences across the object and is produced by flow separation and internal wave generation (McCabe, et al., 2006). Chriss and Caldwell (1982) were among the first to describe observations of form drag within subaqueous horizontal velocity profiles. Their observations of multiple logarithmic regions with slopes that increased with distance from the bed suggest that turbulent stress farther from the bed was greater than it was closer to the bed and concluded that boundary layer flow was significantly influenced by form drag. The influence of form drag on the local flow regime in Belfast Bay was investigated by examining the hourly-averaged horizontal velocity profiles obtained from the bottom-mounted current meter observations at the center of each pockmark (Figure 2 characteristics. Logarithmic regions were identified in this study using a simple, semi automated algorithm that compared the observed velocity profile to a linear modeled profile in logarithmic space. The skill, S , of the model fit was determined by where U (z ) and U(z)modei are the horizontal velocity profiles of the observed and modeled data, respectively, and N is the number of depth-averaged measurements within the profile. Modeled profiles comprised of three or more data points, with a positive slope, and with skill less than two standard deviations from the skill mean were defined as having a logarithmic region near the bed; all other profiles were characterized as nonlogarithmic. For profiles with a logarithmic profile, a second model was applied to data further up in the water column beginning at the highest velocity observation of the first logarithmic layer. In this manner, a second log layer could be observed. The presence of a second logarithmic layer is indicative of form drag resulting from turbulent processes generated by roughness elements located upstream of the velocity measurements (Arya, 1975). Form drag was observed to be significant in the vicinity of the sampled pockmarks Similar to observations obtained by Chris and Caldwell (1982), the vertical gradient of the upper logarithmic region over the sampled pockmarks is always greater than the lower logarithmic region and suggests that roughness-induced form drag significantly contributes to the total boundary stress over the sampled pockmarks. Extending over a large portion of the water column, these logarithmic regions suggest the presence of enhanced turbulence and active mixing in the vicinity of pockmarks. Furthermore, observations of strong vertical velocity events and uniform temperature observations extending from above the rim down into the pockmark in conjunction with multiple logarithmic regions within the horizontal velocity profiles provide evidence for mixing and recirculation over both pockmarks.

Many velocity profiles showed multiple logarithmic regions which suggests form drag significantly influences the local flow regime. These observations of mixing and enhanced turbulence over the sampled pockmarks are consistent with field observations and modeled results of flow over pockmarks (Manley, et al., 2004;Hammer, et a l, 2009;Brothers, et a l, 201 lb). Future studies should include long-term monitoring of the temperature and current patterns over multiple pockmarks to assess the influence of storm events on the vertical stmcture above pockmarks and better constrain circulation patterns within these depressions.\nObservations of time-averaged horizontal and vertical velocity profiles were obtained with bottom-mounted ADCPs at the rim and in the near-center of two pockmarks in Belfast Bay, Maine, over a 48 hour period in late July 2011. Additionally, sediment grab samples were obtained at the rim and center of each pockmark to estimate the water content and median grain size at each location. The Dade et al. (1992) model predicts 9cr for cohesive sediment using many physical properties of the sediment {e.g., <p, R, ps, dn, Ty). This study estimated cp, R, ps, from data documented in the literature (Booth, et al., 1985;Mazzullo, et al., 1988, Gschwend andHites, 1981). Future studies should obtain direct measurements of these variables to better constrain estimates of the critical Shields parameter. Observed currents were further averaged over the mid-water column, ranging from 8 m below the surface to the depth of the rim, and over the deepwater column from the rim to the bottom of the pockmark. Water content measurements ranged from 155 -212% and were used to estimate sediment yield strength based on empirical formulations by Hoepner, et al. (2001). Sampled sediments, assumed to have a density of 2173 kg/m3 (after Gschwend and Hites, 1981), have mean grain diameters of 7.65 jtm and are classified as silty muds. These current and sediment observations were used to estimate periods of incipient motion and to assess whether or not suspended sediment in the water column would settle under the observed flow conditions. Shields parameter estimates, assuming hydrodynamically smooth flow, were made from observations of the near-bottom horizontal currents and the observed median grain size following Whitehouse, et al., (2000). The critical Shields parameter was predicted using the estimated yield stresses and the observed median grain diameter observed at the rim and center of each pockmark, following the theoretical model developed by Dade, et al. (1992) for cohesive sediments. Observed Shields parameters suggest that incipient motion regularly occurs during maximum flood and ebb tidal periods at the rim of each pockmark. The critical Shields parameter was more consistently exceeded at the rim of the southern pockmark where higher velocity flows were observed. Shields parameter estimates at the center of each pockmark were small and always less than the critical value, indicating that near-bed stress imposed by the overriding currents within the pockmarks was not significant enough to move sediment. The relative magnitude of the horizontal and vertical velocities will determine the rate, distance, and direction that suspended sediment will be transported. Mid-water column vertical velocities are primarily negative and small relative to the observed horizontal velocities over this depth range. Therefore, sediment suspended at the rim is likely to be transported downstream. Below the rim, depth-averaged vertical velocities are negative 77% of the time and are comparable in magnitude to the horizontal flows. Therefore, during down-welling periods below the rim, a large proportion of the suspended sediment would settle towards the bed. During the infrequently observed positive vertical velocity events, sediment will remain in suspension unless the settling velocity exceeds the upward-directed flow. Using Stokes Law for grain settling (Winterwerp and Walther, 2004), the maximum grain diameter capable of remaining in suspension under the observed positive vertical velocities was calculated and was always greater than the median grain diameter at the bed. This suggests that in the absence of flocculation and during upwelling periods, sediment entrained into the flow would remain in suspension while the flow conditions persisted. It is important to note that the influence of flocculation is unaccounted for in this analysis and a greater degree of deposition is expected in the vicinity of the pockmarks due to the flocculation of material in the water column. The greater frequency of critical Shields parameter exceedance observed at the rim of the southern pockmark qualitatively agrees with the observed pockmark morphology in Belfast Bay which becomes more elongated with progression southward. However, the majority of the sampling period is characterized by negative, depth-averaged vertical velocities and weak horizontal currents below the rim and strong mid-water horizontal currents. This suggests that a large proportion of the sampling period is characterized by the settling of suspended sediment in the center of the pockmark. Long-term pockmark maintenance may therefore be related to a larger amount of sediment being transported out of the pockmark during upwelling periods than is deposited during downwelling periods; however, this cannot be verified from the data collected in this study. Alternately, maintenance may be controlled by sediment transport induced by higher velocity flow due to spring tides or storm events, rather than by the average tidal, wind, and wave conditions observed in this field experiment. Although this work presents evidence of incipient motion along the rim of the pockmarks during fairly mild conditions, longer term field observations such as these are needed to better determine the nature of the sediment transport in post-formation pockmark maintenance."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 3 OBSERVATIONS OF POCKMARK FLOW STRUCTURE IN BELFAST BAY, MAINE, PART 2: RECIRCULATION AND CAVITY FLOW", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Pockmark flow circulation patterns are investigated through current measurements along the rim and center of two pockmarks in Belfast Bay, Maine. Observed time-varying current profiles have a complex vertical and directional structure that rotates significantly with depth and is strongly dependent on the phase of the tide. Observations of the vertical profiles of horizontal velocities in relation to relative geometric parameters of the pockmark are consistent with circulation patterns described qualitatively by cavity flow models (Ashcroft and Zhang, 2005). The time-mean behavior of the shear layer is typically used to characterize cavity flow and was estimated using vorticity thickness to quantify the growth rate of the shear layer horizontally across the pockmark. Estimated positive vorticity thickness growth rates are qualitatively consistent with cavity flow predictions, but occur at largely different rates between the two pockmarks. Previously modeled flow patterns over pockmarks of similar geometry to those examined herein (Brothers, et al., 2011b), are also conceptually consistent with cavity flow circulation. Therefore, Belfast Bay pockmarks of similar geometry to those sampled in this study may also be characterized by circulation patterns predicted by open cavity flow.\nCurrent observations and sediment characteristics acquired within and along the rim of two pockmarks in Belfast Bay, Maine, were used to characterize periods of incipient motion and to investigate conditions favorable to the settling of suspended sediment.

However, stronger currents along the pockmark rims are consistent with conditions that support incipient motion and sediment suspension near the bed.

Relatively higher velocity tidal flow enters Belfast Bay through a narrow channel to the west of Islesboro Island. The proximity of the southern pockmark to this channel yields more strongly tidally-driven current observations than over the northern pockmark where increased complexity in horizontal current structure may be attributed to converging tidal currents around Islesboro Island . Vertically-varying rotational structure observed over the pockmarks show abrupt directional changes during the ebbing tide that are consistent with open cavity flow and the formation of a recirculation cell within the pockmark (Rockwell and Naudasher, 1978). Cavity flow patterns have been well-studied through multiple theoretical, empirical, and numerical investigations (e.g. Sarohia, 1977;Rockwell et al., 1978;Ahuja and Mendoza, 1995). These studies have shown cavity flow circulation to be strongly influenced by numerous flow parameters including boundary layer thickness, freestream velocity, turbulence, and the geometry of the cavity. The time-mean behavior of the shear layer is typically used to characterize cavity flow and is described as the layer that forms as the overriding flow separates at the upstream rim of the cavity due to the geometry of the depression. The time-mean behavior of the shear layer is strongly dependent on the length-to-depth ratio of the cavity and subdivides cavity flow into two flow regimes: The time-mean development of the shear layer increases with distance downstream in open cavity flow and can be estimated using vorticity thickness (Ashcroft and Zhang, 2005). Vorticity thickness (<5a)) is given by where U\\ is the velocity at the bed (assumed to be 0 m/s), Ui is the freestream velocity and (U) is the time-mean velocity profile of the shear layer that varies with depth. Vorticity thickness was calculated at two length scales within each pockmark based on the relative location of the current meter mount with respect to the leading edge of the pockmark during the flooding (0.6L) and ebbing (0.4L) tide, where L is the diameter at the rim (Figure 3-4).  \nIncipient motion occurs when the Shields parameters (6) exceeds the critical value (0cr) and thus depends on the parameters that determine 6cr. The estimated critical Shields (0cr) parameter is a function of many variables (cp, R, g, ps, p, dn, ty, u, u.), but in this study based on directly measured parameters, is most sensitive to variation in yield stress (ty,) approximations. The linear equation used to calculate yield stress (ty) in this study was developed by Hoepner, et al. (2001). Their model is based on an empirical comparison of measured yields stresses, obtained using a rheometer, and water content values measured from estuarine sediment samples similar in grain size and water content to the sampled Belfast Bay sediment. Differences in water content observed between two measurements obtained at the same location (rim or center) of either pockmark agree to within 15% error. The range in measured water content values at each location is translated to estimates of the critical Shields parameter and is shown with error bars in Figure 4.5.

Under turbulent flow conditions, as observed over the sampled pockmarks (Chapter 2), a logarithmic velocity profile is typically used to characterize the near-bed, time-averaged horizontal velocity profile and to estimate the temporarily varying friction velocity. Following Whitehouse, et al., (2000), under hydrodynamically smooth flow conditions, as are typically found in muddy estuaries (with dn < 62.5 pm) like Belfast Bay, the logarithmic velocity profile varies as a function of u , and height, z, above the bottom, and is given by the equation, ratio of the quadratic bed shear stress gradient, -7^-= p u }, to the immersed weight of the where U(z) is the mean horizontal velocity profile above the bed, u is the kinematic viscosity of water, and ks = 2.5dso is the Nikuradse roughness.

The critical Shields parameter is typically estimated using the empirically-based Shields diagram. However, when sediment exhibits cohesive properties, the critical Shields parameter must account for the cohesive bonds between individual sediment grains. Dade, et al. (1992) formulated a theoretical model to approximate the critical Shields parameter for cohesive sediment as a ratio of the gravitational, frictional, and cohesive properties acting to keep a grain stationary in the presence of lift and drag forces imposed by the overriding, near bed flow. In their model, the cohesive force between particles per surface area of grain is represented by the yield stress, which has been empirically correlated to the critical bed shear stress by Mignoit (1968). Assuming the viscous region of the overriding turbulent flow is large relative to the spherical grain size, Dade, et al. (1992), showed that the critical Shields parameter {dcr) for mud may be approximated by, = 1 + 0 .iC lw (i+l )-(fie-)<3 < 4 -4 > where -^1~R2 ^"}, {"section_title": "R1/3 cos-1 R", "text": "and Re* is the Reynolds number given by its critical value, (/?e*)cr , The angle of repose (<p) of the sediment was approximated as 20 deg, typical of fine grained marine sediment (Booth, et al., 1985). The shape factor b\\ relates the drag force acting on the particle relative to the drag force acting on a sphere of equivalent volume, under the assumption that R, the characteristic aspect ratio of cylindrical grains, is less than one. The characteristic aspect ratio (R = 0.8) was estimated from scanning electron microscope images of sediment collected in the western Gulf of Maine by Mazzullo, et al. (1988). The shape factor is also a function of the characteristic aspect ratio, R, and accounts for the platiness of the particle. The ratio F/JFg relates the net interparticle cohesive force acting in the vertical (Fa) to the submerged particle weight induced by gravity (Fg), and is a function of the yield stress, ty, of the surficial, fine-grained sediment. The yield stress of remolded sediment is typically and most directly measured using a controlled stress rheometer (Van Kessel and Blom, 1998), and was empirically related to the measured moisture content of the soil, W, by Hoepner, et al., (2001) by Ty = 5.75 -1.84W (4-6) Substitution of (4.5) into (4.4) and using (4.3) -(4.6) yields a cubic equation in u ,cr that can be solved analytically, with the single real root being the solution of interest. The critical friction velocity can then be substituted into (4.3) to yield the critical Shields parameter that defines a threshold over which cohesive sediment is expected to move. For sediment to settle out of suspension, the sediment settling velocity must be greater than the depth-averaged vertical velocities, w, near the bed. When depthaveraged vertical velocities are negative and comparable in magnitude to the depthaveraged horizontal currents, suspended sediment will settle at a rate that varies with sediment grain size and density. Conversely, when depth-averaged vertical velocities are positive, settling will only occur if the settling velocity of an individual particle is greater than the upwelling vertical velocities. The terminal settling velocity of a particle is reached when the downward force induced by gravity is counteracted by the resistive force induced by the fluid's drag. Stoke's law (Winterwerp and Van Kesteren, 2004) defines the terminal settling velocity, Vs, in terms of the particle diameter dn, where p. is the dynamic viscosity of water. The maximum grain diameter capable of remaining in suspension under the observed flow conditions, dnmax, can be determined by substituting the observed depth-averaged vertical velocities, w, for the terminal settling velocity, Vs, and solving for dHmax, where, Next, sediment samples were prepared for sediment grain size analysis and placed in 100 mL beakers filled with a 3% Hydrogen Peroxide solution for 60 days to decompose all organic matter. Prior to analysis, individual sediment samples were disaggregated using an ultrasonic disintegrator.

Measured water content values ranged from 155 -212% by weight and typically, in 3 of 4 cases, varied by less than 5% between the two samples obtained from the same location. Although a larger variation (about 30%) in water content values was observed from samples obtained at the center of the southern pockmark, the fractional error is within about 15%. These measurements are comparable to values of water content made by Hoepner, et al. (2001) from sediment with similar characteristics to the Belfast Bay sediment. Yield stress (Ty) estimates were calculated from mean water content values at each location using (4.6), following Hoepner, et al., (2001), and are also summarized in Table 1.

Furthermore, deepwater vertical velocities, comparable in magnitude to the depth-averaged horizontal velocities below the rim, are less than 0 (down-welling currents) 75% of the time. This suggests that on average, suspended sediments in the water column would tend to settle towards the bed. However, observations over the center of the pockmark of the ratio of the depth-averaged vertical velocities to the horizontal currents being greater than 1 at various depths below the rim in conjunction with estimated maximum grain diameters much greater than the median grain diameter at the bed, suggest that any suspended sediment below the rim during these time periods may potentially be transported out of the pockmark as a result of these strong upward-directed velocities ."}, {"section_title": "Pockmark Maintenance", "text": "Pockmark morphology in Belfast Bay transitions from more spherical in the north to more elongated in the south and suggests that pockmark shape may not be exclusively controlled by vertical fluid escape. Maximum grain size estimations under terminal settling velocity conditions in excess of the median grain diameter in conjunction with observed periods of incipient motion along the rim of the southern pockmark, suggest that pockmark size and shape may be modified by near-bed sediment transport. The greater frequency of excess bed shear stress along the rim of the more southerly located pockmark is consistent with the elongated morphology of the pockmarks in the southern region of Belfast Bay. Similar observations of pockmark morphology transitioning from spherical to more elongated with distance offshore are found in Blue Hill Bay, Maine, and Passamaquoddy Bay, New Brunswick, Canada (Brothers, et al., 2012) and may be related to fine-grained sediment erosion induced by excess bed shear stress along the rims of the pockmarks. Although near-bed sediment transport is observed along the rims of each pockmark, incipient motion is never predicted to occur at the near-center of the pockmarks. Observations at the center of each pockmark of primarily negative (downward-directed) vertical velocities below the rim in conjunction with the critical Shields parameter never being exceeded suggest that the sampled pockmarks would fill in over time under similar conditions. However, these pockmarks have persisted for up to 11,000 years (Brothers, et al., 2010). Potential mechanisms to explain the preservation of these large depressions over long time periods, may be related to the influence of strong upwelling events or local storm events enhancing sediment transport within pockmarks. Strong upwelling events below the rim, as observed in this study, may advect suspended sediment out of the pockmark and more or less balance the net sediment deposition occurring during downwelling periods below the rim. Alternately, pockmark maintenance may be primarily controlled by sediment transport induced by higher-velocity flow due to spring tides or storm events, rather than during the average tidal current conditions during our sampling period. The influence of these higher flow conditions is not considered herein, but is the subject of ongoing research."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 5 CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Current and temperature and salinity observations over two sampled pockmarks in Belfast Bay, ME show evidence for internal mixing and overturning within the pockmark, circulation patterns that resemble open cavity flow, and incipient motion along the rims. Vertical current profiles were acquired at the rim and near-center of each pockmark using bottom mounted ADCPs over a 48 hour sampling period in late July 2011. Additionally, multiple CTD casts were acquired approximately every two hours over the near-center of each pockmark for a complete tidal cycle to examine the tidallyvarying vertical structure over each pockmark. Sediment samples were also obtained at the rim and center of each pockmark to examine the grain size distribution and obtain water content measurements at each location. The sampled pockmarks consisted of a circular pockmark with a length-to-depth ratio of 3.7 and 45 m diameter in the northern region of the bay and a more elongated pockmark with a length-to-depth ratio of 4.7 and 85 m diameter in the southern region of the bay. The observed vertical current structure over each pockmark was characterized by three distinct regions, the surface, middle, and deep layers, which were delineated by the average depth of the thermocline and rim depth. Surface and mid-water column currents are primarily tidally-driven, but show slight modifications by wind-driven flow. Below the rim, low-velocity horizontal currents show significant rotational changes with depth. Depth-averaged vertical velocities over the near-center of each pockmark show strong upwelling and downwelling events that extend from above the rim down into the pockmark. These events are indicative of the interaction of flow above and below the rim. Evidence for mixing was further documented by salinity and temperature observations obtained from CTD casts over the near-center of each pockmark which showed uniform properties below 12 m. Individual, hourly-averaged horizontal velocity profiles over the center of each pockmark show multiple logarithmic regions. These observations are consistent with those obtained by Chriss and Caldwell (1982) and suggest form drag significantly influences the local flow regime. These vertical velocity and temperature observations suggest that the water column over the sampled pockmarks is characterized by active mixing and overturning of flow above and below the rim, while individual horizontal velocity profiles indicate that roughness-induced form drag significantly influences the local flow regime in the vicinity of the sampled pockmarks. The tidally-varying rotational structure over the near-center of each pockmark is qualitatively consistent with circulation patterns predicted by open cavity flow. Significant directional changes were observed from surface to depth over each pockmark, specifically below the rim. During ebbing tidal conditions, abrupt directional changes were observed around 10 m from the bed and were typically on the order of 180 \u00b1 50 deg. A more gradual change in direction from surface to depth was observed during flooding tidal conditions and was typically around 75\u00b1 50 deg. These observations of more abrupt and significant directional changes with depth during ebbing tidal flow are qualitatively consistent with open cavity flow and the formation of a recirculation cell within the pockmark. Open cavity flow occurs in deep cavities, with length-to-depth ratios less than 6 and is characterized by shear layer growth with distance downstream. Because the current meter mounts positioned within the pockmark were located slightly north of the center, the thickness of the shear layer is expected to be greater during flooding tidal conditions. The time-mean behavior of the shear layer, approximated using vorticity thickness, was estimated from horizontal current magnitudes acquired over the near center of each pockmark. Although the rate at which the shear layer grew across the depression differed between pockmarks, mean vorticity thickness estimates were greater to the critical Shields parameter, estimated using the theoretical model proposed by Dade, et al. (1992) for cohesive sediment. A critical Shields parameter was estimated for the rim and center locations of each pockmark based on measured grain size and water content values obtained from sampled sediment at each location and estimated sediment density, shape, and angle of repose. The critical Shields parameter was exceeded several times at the rim of each pockmark, typically during maximum velocity tidal periods and more consistently at the southern pockmark rim. At the center, the critical Shields parameter was never exceeded. The majority of the sampling period is characterized by downwelling below the rim and corresponding low-velocity horizontal currents. This suggests that the settling of suspended sediment within each pockmark would characterize the majority of the sampling period. At the rim, although also primarily characterized by downwelling flow, the corresponding horizontal currents are much stronger than the vertical velocities. Therefore, any suspended sediment is likely to be transported to a distant location. During the infrequent observations of upward-directed flow below the rim and directly above the rim, estimated maximum grain diameters capable of remaining in suspension under the observed vertical velocities are always much greater than the median grain diameter. This suggests that in the absence of flocculation, sediment would remain in suspension as long as these upwelling currents persisted. The more frequent exceedence of the critical Shields parameter at the rim of the southern pockmark is consistent with observations of more elongated pockmark morphology in Belfast Bay with progression seaward. Although multiple time periods are characterized by incipient motion, the majority of the sampling period is characterized by flow conditions favorable to deposition. Therefore, long-term pockmark maintenance in Belfast Bay may be more controlled by sediment transport induced by higher-velocity flows due to spring tides or storm events, rather than the average flows sampled in this study. Future work should include long-term monitoring of the current and temperature structure at multiple locations within and around pockmarks in order to better understand the three-dimensional flow structure around these depressions. Field measurements should be conducted during storm events and spring and neap tides to assess the influence of these varying environmental conditions on the vertical structure over pockmarks and near-bed sediment transport. Sediment transport studies within the vicinity of pockmarks should acquire current measurements closer to the bed, floe size and settling rate estimates, as well as more detailed measurements of the physical properties of the sediment (e.g., 9 , R, ps) in order to better constrain pockmark sedimentation and erosion rates. Measurements of floe size and settling velocity as well as the parameters that influence them may be achieved through use of multiple instruments including a digital floe camera, video settling column, optical backscatter sensor and current meter as described by Mikkelsen et al. (2004) and Fennessy et al., (1994)."}]
