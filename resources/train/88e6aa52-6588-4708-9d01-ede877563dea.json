[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Plasmopara obducens is the biotrophic oomycete responsible for impatiens downy mildew, a destructive disease of Impatiens that causes high crop loss. Currently, there are no available methods for the microscopic detection of P. obducens from leaves of impatiens, which may be contributing to the spread of the disease. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a sensitive and robust method that uses sequence-specific, fluorescence-labeled oligonucleotide probes to detect target organisms from the environment. To study this important pathogen, we developed and standardized a FISH technique for the visualization of P. obducens from Impatiens walleriana tissues using a species-specific 24-mer oligonucleotide probe designed to target a region of the rRNA internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2).\nResults: Since P. obducens cannot be propagated in vitro, we developed a custom E. coli expression vector that transcribes the P. obducens rRNA-ITS target sequence (clone-FISH) for use as a control and to optimize hybridization conditions. The FISH assay could detect P. obducens sporangiophores, sporangia and oospores, and hyphae from naturally infected I. walleriana leaves and stems. Cross-reactivity was not observed from plant tissue, and the assay did not react when applied to E. coli with self-ligated plasmids and non-target oomycete species.\nConclusions: This FISH protocol may provide a valuable tool for the study of this disease and could potentially be used to improve early monitoring of P. obducens, substantially reducing the persistence and spread of this destructive plant pathogen."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Impatiens downy mildew caused by the obligate biotroph Plasmopara obducens (Oomycota, Peronosporales) is one of the most devastating diseases of the ornamental bedding plant Impatiens walleriana, and also may affect interspecific hybrids and related wild species of Impatiens (impatiens; [1] [2] [3] ). Symptoms of impatiens downy mildew (IDM) include leaf yellowing, stunted growth, leaf drop and stem collapse [4] . As the disease progresses, a white downy-like growth on the underside of leaves can be observed, corresponding with the emergence of asexual fruiting structures (sporangiophores and zoosporebearing sporangia) from the leaf stomata [5] . Oospores, the pathogen's primary survival structure, are formed in stems of plants that have recently died, and may serve as a primary inoculum source for subsequent growing seasons in landscape settings [6] . Plasmopara obducens sporangia are spread by wind currents or by water from rain or irrigation, and under cool and moist conditions, the disease spreads rapidly [6] .\nEpidemic outbreaks of IDM on I. walleriana were first reported in the early 2000s in the UK, Europe and Australia [7] [8] [9] [10] . In the United States, the first epidemic outbreaks that reached landscape settings started during the 2011 and 2012 growing seasons [1, 2, [11] [12] [13] [14] .\nCurrently, IDM is reported throughout the continental US and the Hawaiian Islands, and continues to limit the health and production of this economically important crop, worth $120 million as of 2014 (USDA-National Agricultural Statistics Service Census of Agriculture 2015 report, https ://www.agcen sus.usda.gov, [3] ). Diagnosis of IDM relies on the presence of typical symptoms that can include leaf yellowing and stunted growth, and at later stages of the disease, is aided by the visible signs of the pathogen's vegetative and fruiting bodies on the undersurface of infected leaves. However by the time that disease symptoms and visual signs of the pathogen appear, the disease is incurable: plants cannot be treated and losses cannot be avoided. Additionally, plants may be infectious long before detectable symptoms appear. Early detection methods aimed at identifying the infection status of apparently uninfected individuals is key for efficient use of disease control resources [15] .\nFluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has been widely used as a cultivation-independent tool for direct detection, identification and quantification of microorganisms [16] . The cultivation-independent characteristic of this technique is also particularly important for microorganisms such as obligate biotrophs, as it allows for the direct study of plant pathogens in their natural environment [17, 18] . Although updated techniques, applications and protocol improvements are now available for FISH, the technique is based around four core steps: (1) specimen fixation and immobilization; (2) permeabilization to increase accessibility of an organism specific-nucleic acid probe to the target; (3) hybridization of the probe; (4) washing to remove unbound probe; and (4) documentation by microscopy or flow cytometry [16, 19, 20] . Typical oligonucleotide probes used for FISH range between 15 and 30 base pairs in length and are labeled with one or more fluorescent dyes [20] . Most FISH applications target ribosomal RNA (rRNA), as these molecules are highly abundant and stable within cells, and possess both variable and highly conserved sequence domains [19] . Single copy genes can also be detected using FISH when coupled with signal amplification techniques such as catalyzed reporter deposition-CARD-FISH [21] . Even though FISH assays using oligonucleotide probes targeting rRNA were first introduced almost 30 years ago [22] , only few studies have applied this technique for the visualization of oomycete plant pathogens such as Phytophthora agathidicida and P. cinnamomi [23] [24] [25] . Nonspecific fluorescent staining techniques have been used to visualize infection structures and plant cellular growth and response to the grape downy mildew pathogen Plasmopara viticola [26] [27] [28] , and to visualize the in planta development of pathogens such as Peronospora sparsa, Pe. tabacina, Pseudoperonospora cubensis, and Ps. humuli, causing rose, tobacco, cucurbit, and hops downy mildew, respectively [28, 29] . However, to date, FISH assays have not been developed for species-specific visualization of oomycetes that cause downy mildew diseases.\nThe aim of the current study is to develop a detailed protocol for species-specific FISH visualization of the impatiens downy mildew pathogen. For this, a specific oligonucleotide probe targeting the rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of P. obducens was developed and tested using the clone-FISH approach and then validated with P. obducens mycelia, sporangiophores, sporangia and oospores harvested from I. walleriana, as well as I. walleriana leaves and stems showing symptoms of downy mildew. The development of a FISH probe and hybridization assay allowed the microscopic visualization of P. obducens within I. walleriana plant tissues, easily distinguishable from plant cells. This technique could be a useful tool for pathogen detection on non-symptomatic I. walleriana, as well as a tool to study P. obducens life cycle including key cellular events such as host penetration and colonization."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Probe design", "text": "The oligonucleotide probe used in this study (rRNA_ ITS_Pob) was designed to specifically target P. obducens. This was achieved by comparing the P. obducens rRNA ITS 1 and 2 regions (including the 5.8S rRNA gene) [1] with publicly available rRNA ITS sequences retrieved from NCBI GenBank of closely related oomycetes in the Peronosporaceae family and oomycete plant pathogens commonly found inhabiting soil. The rRNA_ITS_Pob probe (5\u2032-ACC AAA CTG GTC GCC GAC TTG TTA -3\u2032) has a melting temperature of 59 \u00b0C, G-C content 45.8%, phosphorothioate bonds (to be resistant to nuclease degradation), and was synthesized commercially (IDT, Coralville, IA, USA). Preliminary assessments of autoflorescence emitted by I. walleriana leaves, stems and flowers revealed broad emissions in the green spectra (data not shown), which precluded the use of green spectra fluorophores such as GFP. Two versions of the probe within the blue and red emission spectra were synthesized: one probe with an AlexaFluor350 fluorophore (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) at the 5\u2032 end (excitation = 346 nm, emission = 442 nm [blue]) and a second probe with an AlexaFluor594 fluorophore at the 5\u2032 end (excitation = 590 nm, emission = 617 nm [red] ). The spectral properties of these two fluorophores (excitation and emission maximum wavelengths, brightness and photostability) made them the most appropriate for this application."}, {"section_title": "Preparation of control materials: clone-FISH cells and non-target oomycetes", "text": "In the absence of pure cultures of P. obducens that could be used as controls to evaluate the rRNA_ITS_Pob probe before its application on impatiens samples, a clone-FISH protocol was used to develop E. coli cells expressing the P. obducens target sequence, following the general method of Schramm et al.

One E. coli colony containing plasmid constructs with the insert in the correct orientation was purified using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) and used to transform E. coli BL21 Star (DE3) One Shot cells (Invitrogen, Carlsband, CA, USA) containing a genomic copy of IPTGinducible T7 RNA polymerase to generate sufficient transcript for hybridization purposes. One E. coli colony with plasmids containing the insert in the opposite direction and one E. coli colony carrying a self-ligated plasmid (without the insert) were used as negative controls and used to transform E. coli DE3 cells. Cells were cultivated in fresh LB broth in a shaking incubator at 37 \u00b0C until they reached a mid-log phase (OD 600 of 0.3-0.4). IPTG (isopropyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside) in a final concentration of 0.5 mM was added to the cultures and allowed to incubate for 1 h to induce transcription of the insert sequence. Chloramphenicol (170 g L ) was added to the cell culture for 4 h and cells were then fixed overnight in 4% formaldehyde solution at 4 \u00b0C.

The region used to develop the probe was located within the ITS 2 region and possessed ideal nucleotide composition for use as a probe (data not shown). Additional probe regions in the ITS rRNA regions with enough species-specific nucleotides were not identified. BLASTn searches against NCBI GenBank showed that ITS sequences from two samples of the lettuce downy mildew pathogen Bremia lactucae (host = Hemistepta lyrata) shared significant similarity with the probe, with 100% identity over 79% of the sequence (e-value = 2.3; accessions DQ235793, DQ235794). Other members of the genus Plasmopara shared a maximum of 96% identity over 88% of the probe sequence (e.g. P. nivea EF553508, host = Aegopodium podagraria; P. angustiterminalis DQ993167, host = Xanthium strumarium; e-value = 1e \u2212 04). However, given the fact that none of these Peronosporaceae organisms are known to inhabit impatiens, cross-reactivity with these organisms from impatiens samples is extremely unlikely. Exposure times for images of clone-FISH and P. obducens positive samples using the Alexa-350 and Alexa-594-labeled probes varied according to the sample assayed, with clone-FISH cells requiring exposure times an order of magnitude longer (2.6-5.2 s exposure; Fig. 2a-c) than P. obducens mycelia and oospores (50-500 ms exposure) or pathogen-infected leaf tissue (5-20 ms exposure).

The rRNA_ITS_Pob probe labeled with the Alexafluor 350 (blue) dye generally gave a less intense signal than the probe labeled with Alexafluor 594 (red), but still provided specific labeling of P. obducens sporangiophores and sporangia (Fig. 3g-i) .\nNaturally infected I. walleriana leaves that were cleared previous to the FISH treatment produced fluorescence signal that corresponded to P. obducens hyphae growing within the palisade and spongy mesophyll (Figs. 4a-f,  5c ). Fluorescence appeared especially intense on some areas of the I. walleriana leaves (Fig. 5b) , mostly due to accumulated overlaying invading hyphae, which are common beneath the pathogen penetration sites and the presence of haustoria in mesophyll cells [34] . Based on these results, it appears that the probe has the ability to penetrate several layers of I. walleriana cells. This would allow for the application of this assay on a variety of I. walleriana plant tissues, without the need of histological sectioning.
