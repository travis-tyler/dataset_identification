[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Rangeland biodiversity is declining as a result of both loss and degradation of habitat (Brennan and Kuvlesky 2005; Neilly et al. 2016) . Rangelands are largely privately owned (76% of the northern Great Plains) and managed for beef production (Samson and Knopf 1994) . Th us, ranchers are key to restoring and sustaining biodiversity in rangeland ecosystems (Neilly et al. 2016) .\nBeef production and wildlife conservation are not mutually exclusive (Krausman et al. 2009 ), but there are impediments to using livestock to manage for wildlife habitat on private land. Increased grazing capacity and livestock production on grazing land is typically achieved by increasing grazing effi ciency (i.e., percentage consumption of the available forage) through improved grazing distribution (Fuhlendorf and Engle 2001; With et al. 2008) . Improving grazing effi ciency was the primary purpose of rangeland incentive and investment tive data. Th is strategy is useful because it allows participants to talk both broadly and deeply about topics related to vegetation heterogeneity, and allows the researcher to explore and clarify topics that arise during the interview (Marshall and Rossman 2010) . Qualitative data are particularly well suited for developing a deeper understanding of ranchers' experiences (Marshall and Rossman 2010) and thus fi t the purpose of this research. Patton (2015) and Merriam and Tisdell (2016) contend that the fi ndings of qualitative inquiry can off er guidance in making future decisions. Patton (2015) argued that these reasonable extrapolations \"are modest speculation on the likely applicability of fi ndings to other situations under similar conditions. Extrapolations are logical, thoughtful, case-derived, and problem oriented rather than statistical and probabilistic\" (713). Th is study explored ranchers' opinions (1) of various types of habitat that are required by diff erent species of wildlife, such as bare ground and denser grass or shrubby areas, and (2) about ways these habitats can be created, such as through grazing, fi re, and burrowing mammals.\nTh is research involved human participants. Th e University of Nebraska-Lincoln Institutional Review Board certifi ed this research project as Exempt Category 2 prior to its completion, under IRB number 20141114643 EX project ID 14643. Informed consent was obtained from participants prior to completing the research interviews.\ning rangeland ecosystems for structural heterogeneity at larger scales (Fuhlendorf et al. 2012; Freese et al. 2014) . Various methods of restoring rangeland heterogeneity have been promoted in the literature, such as patch-burn grazing (Fuhlendorf et al. 2009; Toombs et al. 2010; Johnson et al. 2011) . However, private ranchers and agencies that assist them have been slow to adopt range scientists' recommendations that would lead to heterogeneity (Toombs and Roberts 2009; Becerra et al. 2017) . Even though the human dimension of grazing management is as important as the ecological dimension (Briske et al. 2011) , there is a knowledge gap concerning ranchers' perceptions of rangeland heterogeneity on a landscape scale. Scientists should explore relevant issues with the study population before doing intensive explanatory quantitative studies. Th us, the purpose of this study was to explore ranchers' worldviews as they related to vegetation heterogeneity and tools used to create it in relation to wildlife habitat in the northern Great Plains."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "To meet the purpose of this study, a qualitative, naturalistic approach was used, which involved in-depth interviews that resulted in rich and contextual qualita- Figure 1 . To demonstrate the relevance of heterogeneity to biodiversity, we have highlighted the habitat requirements of diff erent bird species found in the northern Great Plains. A diverse bird community in the northern Great Plains requires a variety of habitats, from bare ground to shrubby areas. For example, common nighthawks (Chordeiles minor) nest on rocky and bare ground surfaces, grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) nest in moderately thick grassy habitats, and loggerhead shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus) require shrubby habitats. To have each of these species, and thus high biodiversity, each of these diff erent habitat types is required, and if each habitat type is present the area would have habitat heterogeneity.\ninsights, we assumed our pool had reached saturation and concluded the interview process.\nDuring the interviews, the key concept of interest was landscape heterogeneity, although this term was not directly used because heterogeneity can have different meanings to diff erent people. Instead, images of rangelands and management schemes were used to help ranchers visualize the landscape and management scenarios and aid in consistent interpretation of the scenarios. In the context of this research, heterogeneity is the existence of patches with diff erent habitat structures (e.g., an area with bare ground next to an area with taller, dense grass) in a given area of interest (Addicott et al. 1987) , and a fi gure similar to Figure 1 was shown to producers to help explain this concept. Further, the importance of large patches of habitat was emphasized because most animals have minimum area requirements (Noss 1983) . Th is type of heterogeneity is important for biodiversity in the Great Plains because the evolution of species in the region was tied to the dynamic nature of the grassland ecosystem, where ecological drivers such as burning, grazing, burrowing animals, and drought interacted over space and time to create a highly heterogeneous environment. Th us, some species require bare ground whereas others require taller, denser grass structure (Fig. 1) ."}, {"section_title": "Analysis", "text": "A thematic analysis was used to interpret the interview responses (Marshall and Rossman 2010) .

We focused on the western regions in each of these states because these are areas of largely intact rangeland that are used primarily for ranching. To identify ranchers for this study in Nebraska, key informants from the University of Nebraska Extension Service were asked for contact information of ranchers who might be willing to participate. In South Dakota, an NRCS agent and members of the South Dakota Grasslands Coalition provided contact information of ranchers. In North Dakota, mentors from the North Dakota Grazing Lands Coalition, who are ranchers, participated in interviews.\nEighteen individuals were contacted for interviews and 15 responded positively to the request; however, only 11 interviews were completed with 12 individuals (one interview was with a husband-wife team): four in North Dakota, four in South Dakota, and three in Nebraska. Two interviews were not completed because we could not fi nd a common time, and two others were not completed because the individuals did not ranch in the study area. Beef production was each participant's primary source of income, and all but one were commercial cow-calf operations. Th ree of the ranchers also had secondary jobs and three of the operations included custom grazing. Th e participating ranchers were predominantly men between the ages of 30 and 70, which is comparable to rancher characteristics from the USDA Census of Agriculture (United States Department of Agriculture 2015). Grazing strategies used varied among the diff erent ranches, and included short-duration grazing (SDG), season-long, continuous grazing, and deferred rotation grazing."}, {"section_title": "Data Collection", "text": "Ranchers were interviewed using a semi-structured, open-ended interview guide and clarification and probing questions were used to prompt elaboration on matters raised by participants or on topics that had not been previously considered by the researchers. Each interview lasted approximately one hour and was completed at a location of the participant's choosing. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.

Even so, the participants agreed that \"we're all driven fi nancially. \"\nSome of the ranchers interviewed were using incentive programs to help them maintain their income while also managing for conservation objectives. When asked what might encourage a rancher to engage in conservation activities, one participant said, \"Benefi ts. Usually that means either on the ground or, quite frankly, cash. Th e Great Plains Project, when I started dividing my pastures, paid for 75% of the fencing. \" Another said, \"I'm sure you dangle the monetary carrot in front of ranchers, they' d be willing. Money will make most people do anything. \" Th us, even though the promise of money can cause some ranchers to engage in practices that are bad for wildlife, it can also be wielded by conservation agencies for the good of wildlife by helping ensure ranchers can make a living.\nFinally, one rancher mentioned that ranchers generally have more freedom to try diff erent things than their parents did, because they face fewer fi nancial pressures. He said, \"My dad, he didn't want to abuse the land, but he needed to make it work. \" He talked about the fact that much of the land, cattle, and equipment are paid off , allowing ranchers today to be more considerate of nonproduction outcomes. Further, ranchers now have safety nets from the government that were only available to crop producers in the past.

Ranchers oft en maintained control by reducing risk and increasing fl exibility."}, {"section_title": "MAKING A LIVING", "text": "All ranchers discussed the importance of ensuring that they could make a living from ranching, and they could only do so if their operation was prosperous. One rancher said, \"I am still looking out trying to make sure I am going to have enough to eat next year and fi ve years from now. . . . It's been my family's way of staying alive for 130 years.\" However, some ranchers lamented that the promise of fast money seemed to encourage overgrazing and converting rangeland to cropland. With high cattle prices, one rancher complained that a lot of people were overgrazing. Another spoke about how his wildlife; however, they clearly stated that wildlife was not their focus. For instance, one rancher said, \"Making sure I can still aff ord to pay the taxes is way more valuable to me than making sure the mountain plover has habitat. \" Some ranchers were not concerned about managing habitat for wildlife because they did not believe rangeland wildlife could ever be completely lost.\nPrairie dogs were a particularly controversial subject for ranchers because of the view that prairie dogs degrade areas and compete with cattle for forage (Lybecker et al. 2002) . One rancher said, \"Th ey're more of a nuisance than anything else. . . . Once they're established, that resource is essentially destroyed for anything other than a prairie dog town or wildlife habitat. \" Some ranchers even stated that prairie dogs were bad from an ecosystem standpoint, while at the same time expressing an understanding that they are part of the native ecosystem. Th e reason underlying this view of prairie dogs likely relates back to the fi rst theme, with ranchers wanting to control their resource: prairie dogs can be controlled. One rancher said, \"I don't care what kind of program there is, prairie dogs need not be involved in ranching. Th ey get out of control too quick. \" Conversely, one rancher joked that if he could have a shooting range for prairie dogs, and make money off them, he might be more willing to host a prairie dog town on his land.\nTh ese negative sentiments for prairie dogs were also expressed in discussions about wildlife that require more bare-ground habitat, like mountain plovers (Charadrius montanus) or burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia). One rancher said, \"I'll be very honest with you, I have not given much thought to those species that require bare ground, \" while another expressed that he was fi ne with birds that require denser vegetation thriving more than birds needing bare ground and short vegetation.\nAlthough wildlife is not the focus for ranchers, several ranchers included native diversity as a management goal: \"I see multitude of species, both plants, animals, and insects, as the benchmark or template of what we should be using in production agriculture. \" Another rancher said, \"I think diversity and balance is very important. I'm a fi rm believer in the importance of diversity because we lost our diversity. \""}, {"section_title": "Th eme 3: Th e Miracle of Animal Impact", "text": "Most animal impact is a result of domesticated livestock.

One rancher stated, \"If you want to be rich, don't ever experiment. You see what somebody else does, what works. \" Th us, by continuing to do what worked in the past and only what worked for others, the ranchers maintained control and reduced risk in their operations. However, there also was recognition of why something is done a certain way: \"I think sometimes, in our fi eld, it's very easy for people to get stuck in a rut of, well, we've always grazed the south pastures in July because Grandpa did, and we don't have a reason why.\" Understanding why management was done in a certain way may facilitate change if the rancher recognizes that the circumstances have changed."}, {"section_title": "CHANGE IS SLOW", "text": "One rancher explained how it took him 20 years of observing, learning, and making incremental changes before he fully bought into diff erent approaches, such as short-duration grazing. Another said, \"Change happens one generation at a time, one funeral at a time.\" Th e threat of going broke can help to speed up change. When asked why he had decided to change his management style in the past, one rancher responded, \"I was about to go broke.\" Another rancher said, \"Not being profitable speeds up change pretty quick.\" Thus, although change was oft en slow and diffi cult for ranchers, there were times when change was necessary. Change was oft en associated with maintaining control and ensuring that the family would continue to be supported by the ranch."}, {"section_title": "Th eme 2: Wildlife Is Not Our Focus", "text": "Many of the ranchers appreciated wildlife on their land, and felt that their management strategy supported thought there was a lot of habitat variability across the landscape, sometimes because of management and sometimes because of abiotic factors. For example, one rancher described some spots in his pasture that were unable to support any grass: \"We have bentonite clay pan areas that pretty much stay bare. Th ey used to be bigger areas that were bare; now we shrunk them way down. \" Th is rancher managed to reduce bare areas, thus potentially reducing habitat heterogeneity.\nFor ranchers, \"managing to the middle\" was a product of managing their risk. Ranchers did not want to risk soil erosion by grazing too heavily, and they also did not want to let too much grass remain unused because it is considered wasteful and increases the risk of wildfi res. Further, they wanted to be able to maintain operations through droughts. One rancher said, \"I think cover is the key to a lot of this. . . . You have to keep the soil covered, you have to keep your rangeland covered. \" Most ranchers did not want bare ground because it would negatively impact long-term beef production. However, because of logistics, some ranches have an area that is consistently overused: \"I have a calving area and just dedicated that to destroy that piece of land. \" If many ranchers have a dedicated calving pasture, there is possibly habitat at the bare-ground end of the spectrum across the landscape, which is necessary for wildlife diversity.\nMost of the ranchers interviewed were strongly opposed to increasing bare ground on purpose: \"You're going to have a real diffi cult time convincing most holistically minded ranchers that they should have bare ground. Th at, for one thing, is just so devastating to the soil ecosystem. \" Some of the ranchers had worked very hard to move their operations away from having a lot of bare ground and stated that it was a constant battle to ensure that the land did not move toward bare ground and erosion. Th us, ranchers manage to the middle for plant-use effi ciency for livestock production."}, {"section_title": "Th eme 5: Perceptions of the Good Rancher and Maintaining Relationships", "text": "Most ranchers interviewed were concerned about being viewed as good ranchers by their peers, because \"everybody looks over the fence. \" Th is reality had an impact on how ranchers managed their pastures. When asked what their opinion was of some photos that showed bare ground, a common participant response was \"bare ground just means someone's not monitoring someas bison, which provided most of the animal impact prior to European settlement: consumption of forage, trampling of vegetation, and the deposition of dung and urine. All the interviewed ranchers held strong beliefs in the importance of livestock for the health of rangelands, and some spoke of the importance of animal impact and how the benefi ts from grazing livestock were like a miracle. One said, \"As far as the grass that comes, the weed suppression, what it does for the trees, I mean it's unbelievable. And it's all animal impact.\" Many of the ranchers also described their management as recreating what the bison had done for millennia, with quick heavy impact on the vegetation and then long periods of rest. One rancher said, \"Th at's exactly what all of us are trying to do, mimic nature. Just much smaller scale. \"\nPrior to settlement of the Great Plains, bison movements were strongly associated with fi re (Biondini et al. 1999) . However, fi re was not part of the management strategy of any of the ranchers interviewed. Ranchers mostly agreed that fi re was a \"tool in their toolbox\" but that they had no interest in using it because they believed it reduced rangeland productivity and forage availability. For instance, one rancher said, \"I don't ever want to burn a pasture that I can graze. If I can stomp the material into the ground it makes more sense than it does to burn it off . \" Grazing by livestock was the principal tool for rangeland management by ranchers interviewed, especially because ranchers viewed fi re as unsafe and unable to provide any benefi ts that were diff erent from grazing. One rancher explained how fragmentation in his area due to urbanization made the use of fi re impossible, even though he thought it could be benefi cial. Another rancher said, \"I can string up an electric fence a whole lot faster than I can put a fi re out. \" Other ranchers were concerned with smoke from fi res causing problems for neighbors and communities. Th us, livestock grazing was easier to manage than fi re, safer than fi re as a management tool, and more eff ective than fi re. One rancher said, \"In this part of the world, that [residual dead vegetation] can be maintained for years if it isn't broken up by something. Once it falls over, it can't be broken up by anything but hooves. \""}, {"section_title": "Th eme 4: Managing to the Middle", "text": "Participants were asked about the different types of habitat that are required by the spectrum of bird species that exist in the Great Plains.

Finally, participants viewed some research as patronizing: \"It's the PhD attitude. I'm just, we're just dumb ranchers, and 'I'm the PhD. ' When you sit down, you gotta get past that. \"\nOne rancher had this advice for fostering a productive dialogue: \"I think it's really important to approach it to understand enough about both sides that you can really fi nd a common ground. \" Another participant said, \"First they have to know something; they just can't be a stand-around-feel-gooder. \" Some participants mentioned Audubon's Conservation Ranching Program, which certifi es bird-friendly beef products, and how Audubon had approached the ranchers for advice and consulting: \"I've been working with Audubon since they actually approached us.

Th ere's the same value to me in [rangeland] as there is in rainforest, or any forest for that matter. It's all part of a balance that we need to maintain as a society. thing very closely\" or \"that's a detriment of overgrazing . . . you fi nd that when things are overgrazed. \"\nTh e desire to maintain neighborly relationships is one reason underlying the slow acceptance of prairie dogs. One participant said:\nIf a prairie dog town got over onto my neighbor's and he wasn't getting any money for it, and despised prairie dogs and wouldn't care if someone was willing to pay him $10,000 a year for a prairie dog town, then that causes a confl ict between my neighbor and I, and I don't want that.\nA diff erent participant said that \"money may not be enough to keep friendships\" when prairie dogs were involved. Th e same might be said for using prescribed fi res: \"If I go out here and light a pasture on fi re my neighbor is going to hate me. \" One participant said outright that \"there's a lot of fear of what your neighbors are going to think or what they're going to say that holds a lot of things back. \" Maintaining good relationships in a ranching community was important to ranchers interviewed; thus, neighbors' perceptions can limit change and the acceptance and adoption of diff erent management strategies. Alternatively, these relationships might encourage change: one rancher mentioned how his neighbors asked for help to implement a grazing management program that was similar to his own, aft er they expressed an interest in obtaining similar results."}, {"section_title": "Th eme 6: Trust Insiders, Mistrust Outsiders", "text": "Th e participants interviewed seemed to trust the motivations and intentions of people within their communities, like cattlemen's associations, and naturally mistrusted those who were from the outside, like nonprofi t organizations. One rancher stated that he wanted to know the source of outsiders' money or, in other words, what their underlying motivation was for speaking with ranchers. Another described why he trusted the Grazing Lands Coalition, a grassroots organization, in his state: \"I know a lot of the guys that are on their board, or have a lot of infl uence with them, and I trust their opinions. \" Generally, ranchers reported some level of disregard or mistrust of information coming through outside or unknown channels. Many of the participants explained that researchers or scientists oft en cannot understand sustainable use of the forage resource, preventing soil erosion, and ensuring that there is vegetation cover on the ground whenever possible. Inefficient use of forage plants for livestock production and allowing bare ground to expand were viewed as poor stewardship. Th ese factors aligned closely with the rangeland health paradigm, which is used by both government agencies and university extension educators when providing technical assistance to ranchers (Symstad and Jonas 2011) . Th us, ranchers viewed themselves as stewards of their rangeland and were concerned about rangeland health.\nFrom the perspective of beef production, fi re was not valued because it removes forage for livestock. From the perspective of ranchers as stewards, it was also logical that fi re was not appreciated because many viewed fi re as degrading rangeland by creating bare ground, thus decreasing rangeland health as it is typically measured by the USDA (Briske et al. 2005; Symstad and Jonas 2011) . Th us, fi res did not align with livestock production goals, and they did not align with ranchers' stewardship goals. Th is viewpoint is supported by NRCS policies: landowners are sometimes paid to not graze aft er a fi re even though functional rangelands have fi re-grazing interactions and grazing following fi re does not necessarily have a negative consequence (Allred et al. 2011; Scasta et al. 2015) .\nWe observed strong views among ranchers that \"prairie dogs have no place on the ranch. \" Th is most likely stemmed from both the stewardship and production perspectives, where bare ground is bad when assessing rangeland health and where prairie dogs compete with livestock for forage (Lamb and Cline 2003) . However, ranchers may simultaneously believe that prairie dogs are a natural part of many rangeland ecosystems-that \"God must have put prairie dogs there for a reason\"-but that they should be eradicated. State and federal policies supporting the control and eradication of prairie dogs reinforce the production and stewardship perspectives of ranchers, where the goals are to decrease bare ground and increase vegetation cover.\nSoil health was an important consideration for many ranchers in this study. In situations where a rancher was restoring cropland or degraded areas, strategies to improve soil health are an important starting point. Because of society's concern with degradation caused by livestock grazing in the western USA (Fleischner 1994; Gutwein and Goldstein 2013) , the adoption of rotational grazing practices may have increased to reduce degradaMany of the participants talked about the love of wideopen spaces or of being able to see long distances. One participant said, \"It was the life, living in the country, and that feeling of wide-open spaces, working hard and sleeping well at the end of the day. \"\nEven with the strong belief in the importance of ranching and rangelands, there were mixed goals for the next generation. One rancher had told his children to get out of agriculture, saying, \"I don't believe it's really a viable way to make a living in the future. \" Many of the participants, however, were encouraging the younger generation to remain in agriculture. \"So many people in agriculture aren't very positive. I mean it's a challenge, it always is, but there's so many opportunities. \" Two ranchers we interviewed had been told by their parents to leave, which they both did, but later they went back to the ranch. One said, \"We moved back for family. Well, family means the ranch. \""}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Effi cient and sustainable beef production is paramount in the rancher's worldview. In this case, sustainability was the ability of the ranch to continue producing beef into the future. Although there has been a paradigm shift within rangeland conservation circles toward managing for vegetation heterogeneity (Fuhlendorf and Engle 2001; Freese et al. 2014) , our interviews showed that a similar shift had not occurred among ranchers in this study. Rather, the ranchers reported being very aware of how their management affected the sustainability of their ranch from the standpoint of forage and beef production, because of the impact on their livelihood, whereas wildlife or biodiversity were secondary objectives for management. Th ese views, which are held by those managing the land, should be known and addressed by conservationists if rangeland biodiversity is to be increased. Further, our interviews suggested that conservation planners can improve producers' odds of achieving wildlife objectives through demonstrations that connect habitat conditions, such as heterogeneity, and counts of wildlife."}, {"section_title": "Th e Rancher as Steward", "text": "Th e ranchers in this study held strong views about what qualifi es as good stewardship of rangelands, including attitudes or actions based on the new information, and may subsequently avoid situations where their views are challenged (Festinger 1962; Tanaka et al. 2011) . However, cognitive dissonance can be motivational (Elliot and Devine 1994) and have an impact on ranchers' views of managing rangeland ecosystems. Cognitive dissonance presents a unique challenge in that private ranchers may avoid information that challenges their beliefs, which will make the job of convincing them of the importance of heterogeneity, fi re, and even prairie dogs that much more diffi cult for outsiders such as conservationists.\nAnother challenge similar to cognitive dissonance stems from the cultural cognition thesis, which suggests that individuals believe their behavior is socially beneficial when they and their peers fi nd it honorable (Kahan et al. 2010 ). Th us, there is a self-reinforcing system that exists in agricultural communities, where there is a lot of pressure to manage in a way that is acceptable to the community, as was examined in the theme \"perceptions of the good rancher and maintaining relationships. \" In this type of system, it may be diffi cult to enact change or to alter policies because of social pressures.\nA fi nal challenge is that heterogeneity is both a foreign concept and is promoted by \"outsiders\" who ranchers do not readily trust (Becerra et al. 2017) . Th is problem has been documented in forest ecosystems, where \"experts\" ranked certain management practices as high priorities, but the forest owners considered the same practices to be of minor importance (Van Gossum et al. 2005) .

Policies that encourage landowners to be wary of fi re reinforce existing beliefs about the harmfulness of fi res in rangeland systems (e.g., signs along federally owned rangelands warning that \"rangeland fi res are destructive\"). State and federal policies about prairie dogs also run counter to ecologists' current understanding of the keystone role of prairie dogs in rangeland systems (Davidson et al. 2012) . Th ese policies perpetuate misconceptions about fi re and prairie dogs rather than tion (Gutwein and Goldstein 2013) . Th e continued belief in the power of livestock grazing to solve a multitude of rangeland problems, as was described in the \"miracle of animal impact\" theme, is supported by NRCS policies that promote rotational grazing through fence installation at the expense of other management goals (Toombs and Roberts 2009 )."}, {"section_title": "Challenges to Address", "text": "Some ranchers in this study had worked very hard through carefully planned grazing management to reverse trends of increasing bare ground, degradation, and erosion. Th us, asking a rancher to increase bareground habitat on their ranch for the benefi t of certain wildlife species is problematic for ranchers because it increases risk and decreases fl exibility. In a volatile system like the livestock industry, moving beyond the basic need of providing a living for their family to higherlevel considerations, like wildlife management, may be diffi cult to justify for ranchers. Th is is a reason that the paradigm shift occurring among some rangeland professionals has not crossed to private ranchers; it is easy for those whose basic needs are not met through beef production to make recommendations about management. Cinner and Pollnac (2004) used similar reasoning to explain why wealthier families in a fi shing village in Mexico were more likely to be amenable to a holistic approach to conservation than poorer families; wealthier families' basic needs were met, whereas poorer families' basic needs were not met. Ted Turner, an iconic rangeland conservationist and a champion for rangeland biodiversity on his ranches (Turner Enterprises 2017), is a perfect example of this dichotomy. Turner is not supporting his basic needs from his bison (livestock) operations, and thus has the ability to take ecological conservation into consideration. Some of the participants in this study noted Turner's support of prairie dogs, and even praised him for it, but stated they could not be expected to support prairie dogs in the same way.\nEven with a growing body of evidence that fi re and prairie dogs are important components of rangeland ecosystems, views on fi re and prairie dogs are still negative. Th e theory of cognitive dissonance provides a possible explanation for this phenomenon. When confronted with information that confl icts with their views, people are more likely to maintain their views than change their will be key in encouraging ranchers to attend these types of events (Pasquini et al. 2010) .\nIncentive-based programs are popular to encourage behavioral change on private land (Langpap 2006) . Indeed, many ranchers in this study mentioned that money can be motivational. Some concerns with incentives that ranchers in this study highlighted included the loss of control over their own operations and concerns over what neighbors may think of their changed management. Further, many of the ranchers believed their management was conducive to diverse rangeland wildlife, and some ranchers may already be supporting rare species on their property. Th ese ranchers would be left out of any incentive programs to encourage behavioral change; therefore, payments for ecosystem services might be another necessary program in rangeland ecosystems, where conservationists are attempting to prevent conversion of native habitats to other uses, such as cropland (Smith and Sullivan 2014) . Th ese concerns should be addressed in any new programs by engaging ranchers in the development of the programs.\nFinally, although money can be a driving factor that makes incentive-based programs useful, research has shown that recognition for conservation eff orts can be an eff ective strategy for encouraging behavioral change or maintaining good practices (Pasquini et al. 2010) . Th is type of incentive is also less expensive. Th us, any of the above practices can be supplemented with awards (e.g., Leopold Conservation Award) that recognize ranchers who excel at conservation, and when there is a lack of funding, this type of program may supersede monetary incentives or payments for ecosystem services."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Ranchers in this study enjoyed having wildlife on their property and were proud of the eff orts they had taken to support that wildlife. However, the ranchers' principal goal was keeping the ranch in business, which in their view required effi cient use of the vegetation resource for grazing livestock production. Managing for heterogeneity was not considered reasonable when optimizing harvest effi ciency of available vegetation and livestock production were their primary objectives. Th ere is no reason for ranchers to consider using tools that create heterogeneity when heterogeneity is not appreciated. Additionally, fire and burrowing animals, which are principal drivers of heterogeneity on rangelands, were promoting a better understanding of natural processes in rangeland ecosystems. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that these policies will change simply based on available science, because policies are value-laden.\nPrior to attempting to change policies, it will be necessary for rangeland conservationists to work with ranchers to begin the hard work of changing attitudes (Serbruyns and Luyssaert 2006; Pasquini et al. 2010) . University extension staff have a key role to play by acting as liaisons between ranchers and scientists (Pasquini et al. 2010 ), as do current eff orts by nonprofi t groups like Th e Nature Conservancy's Fire Learning Network, which engages multiple stakeholders in restoring landscapes that rely on fi re (Th e Nature Conservancy 2015). Th e fact that some ranchers feel less fi nancial pressure may also make this process easier than in the past.\nResearch has shown that strong motivators for staying in ranching are oft en noneconomic (Liff mann et al. 2000; Rowe et al. 2001) , as was presented in the theme \"love of rangelands. \" Ranchers also want to maintain status within their community and be viewed as good ranchers. Furthermore, they are working in a complex industry, which may limit their innovativeness and willingness to consider change (Didier and Brunson 2004) . Th us, social status, respect among community members, and the condition of the industry must be accounted for when developing new programs for ranchers to promote heterogeneity. Engaging with a community's respected ranchers and innovators to promote new management strategies might be a useful strategy.\nA barrage of educational materials is unlikely to help change attitudes among ranchers, because ranchers are unlikely to engage with information that confl icts with their values (Tanaka et al. 2011) . Participants in this study provided insights for addressing these problems in that \"seeing is believing, \" which is in line with previous research showing that innovations must be testable by the rancher prior to full implementation (Pannell et al. 2006) . Universities, state and federal agencies, and nonprofi t organizations must begin using their resources to show ranchers the importance of vegetation heterogeneity in rangeland biodiversity. Field days, research ranches, and landowner workshops that focus on examining heterogeneity are some tools that can be used. Van Gossum et al. (2005, 598) came to a similar conclusion in their forest management study, and suggested that \"local pilot forests could prove to be useful in removing some of the practical diffi culties. \" University Extension and NRCS, two trusted groups, pletion, under IRB number 20141114643 EX project ID 14643. Informed consent was obtained from participants prior to completing the research interviews. not acceptable when they both appear to reduce vegetation production and increase bare ground. Ranchers in this study, therefore, generally discounted heterogeneity and associated practices, because they confl icted with their long-held beliefs and objectives.\nConservationists should recognize that production, economic, and cultural factors drive ranchers' management decisions. Incentives, both monetary and nonmonetary, will be useful in engaging ranchers in conservation, and economic downturns may present an opportunity to approach ranchers when they are more open to alternative forms of income (Powell 2015) . Th is suggestion is in line with a host of recent research (e.g., Czap et al. forthcoming) demonstrating that the adoption of conservation practices is more likely with a combination of monetary and nonmonetary incentives. Our work suggests that eff orts to infl uence management decisions on private land will be most eff ective when they include active engagement, such as on-ranch demonstrations of new management strategies that take account of biodiversity, as well as working with infl uential community members."}, {"section_title": "Research Information Disclosure", "text": "Th is study was funded by North Central Sustainable Agriculture, Research, and Education program (grant number H003679429) and the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Project through Nebraska Game and Parks Commission (grant number W-103-R).
