"}, {"section_title": "Socioeconomic characteristics", "text": "Socioeconomic status (SES) refers to one's access to financial, social, cultural, and human capital resources (National Forum on Education Statistics 2015). The methods for determining SES vary depending on data availability and the purposes for which the SES measures are to be used. For example, in the ECLS-K:2011 data file, researchers have access to a composite measure of SES that is composed of parent education, parent occupational prestige, and household income, which are components commonly used to describe SES (Tourangeau et al. 2015). For the purposes of this Statistics in Brief, two common components of SES are analyzed: household poverty status (which is based on household income) and parents' highest level of education. Please see the Technical Notes for more detail about the SES variables used in this report. By presenting separate results for each component, the brief provides a more detailed view of differences in children's summer experiences by socioeconomic characteristics than it would if a composite measure were used. For example, disparities in students' participation in summer activities may be found by household poverty status but not by parents' highest level of education, or vice versa.  NOTE: Household poverty status is based on preliminary U.S. Census thresholds for 2010, which identify incomes determined to meet household needs, given the household size. Poor households are those with incomes below 100 percent of the federal poverty level ($22,113 in 2010 for a family of four with two children); near-poor households are those with incomes between 100 and 199 percent of the federal poverty level (greater than or equal to $22,113 in 2010 for a family of four with two children, but less than $44,226); and nonpoor households are those with incomes at or above 200 percent of the federal poverty level (greater than or equal to $44,226 in 2010 for a family of four with two children  NOTE: Parents' highest level of education is the highest level of education achieved by either of the parents or guardians in a two-parent household or by the only parent or guardian in a single-parent household. \"Some postsecondary education\" includes parents whose highest level of education is some college, an associate's degree, or career/technical education.

In the summer after kindergarten in 2011, students' vacations spanned 78 days, on average (data not in tables). This section examines the extent to which nonparental care arrangements and participation in summer programs (such as camp or summer school) in 2011 differed by socioeconomic characteristics."}, {"section_title": "Nonparental care arrangements", "text": "In the ECLS-K:2011 parent interview, parents or guardians were asked to report whether their child received child care on a regularly scheduled basis during the summer from someone other than a parent or guardian. Parents were told that these arrangements may include grandparents, brothers and sisters, or any other relative other than a parent or guardian. They also may include home child care providers and regular sitters or neighbors, in addition to day care centers or extended day programs. Parents reported on the type of child care arrangement (i.e., relative, nonrelative, or day care center or extended day program) where the child spent the most time. If a child spent equal time across two or more care arrangements, parents reported in which programs the child spent equal time. For the purposes of this report, children who spent equal hours across two or more child care arrangements are reported as having multiple care arrangements. Parents or guardians were instructed not to report on summer camp in their answers. They were asked about their child's participation in summer camp in subsequent questions. \"Regular\" arrangements were defined by the study as an arrangement or program occurring on a routine schedule (i.e., occurring at least weekly or on some other schedule). They did not include occasional babysitting or \"back up\" arrangements that are just not used routinely. Also, regular care did not include staying with a relative for a period of time during the summer. This report classifies nonparental care arrangements into five groups: \u2022 Relative care is care provided in a private home by a relative of the child. The private home may be the child's home, the caregiver's home, or another home. The care may be provided by a relative who lives in the child's household. \u2022 Nonrelative care is care provided in a private home by someone not related to the child. The private home may be the child's home, the caregiver's home, or another home. The care may be provided by a nonrelative who lives in the child's household. \u2022 Center care includes any type of formal program that provides care and supervision. This includes Head Start programs, nursery schools, preschools, and prekindergarten programs that include children who are in kindergarten or about to enter the first grade (some of which may be sponsored by the state). The care may be provided in a child's school or in another location, such as a church or a free-standing building. \u2022 Multiple care arrangements is care provided in equal amounts of time in each of two or more types of care arrangements. \u2022 None includes children who did not attend any care arrangements on a regular basis. Their primary care arrangement is with their parents. Household poverty status is based on preliminary U.S. Census thresholds for 2010, which identify incomes determined to meet household needs, given the household size. Poor households are those with incomes below 100 percent of the federal poverty level ($22,113 in 2010 for a family of four with two children); near-poor households are those with incomes between 100 and 199 percent of the federal poverty level (greater than or equal to $22,113 in 2010 for a family of four with two children, but less than $44,226); and nonpoor households are those with incomes at or above 200 percent of the federal poverty level (greater than or equal to $44,226 in 2010 for a family of four with two children). 2 Parents' highest level of education is the highest level of education achieved by either of the parents or guardians in a two-parent household or by the only parent or guardian in a single-parent household. \"Some postsecondary education\" includes parents whose highest level of education is some college, an associate's degree, or career/technical education. NOTE: Nonparental care arrangements include child care provided on a regular basis by someone other than a parent or guardian. This does not include occasional babysitting or backup care providers. It also does not include summer camp. \"Center care\" includes child care from day care centers or extended day programs. \"Multiple care arrangements\" is care provided in equal amounts of time in each of two or more types of care arrangements. \"None\" includes children who did not attend any care arrangements on a regular basis.
