[{"section_title": "Executive Summary", "text": "West Hawai'i is home to a dynamic and productive marine ecosystem. Economic and socio-cultural value is provided to residents through numerous ecosystem services, such as commercial and non-commercial fishing, cultural and traditional practices, recreation, tourism, and coastal protection. However, ecological communities across West Hawai'i-particularly, coral reefs-have suffered recent and unprecedented declines. Marine ecosystem degradation can compromise underlying ecosystem functions and processes and undermine the numerous goods, services, and benefits upon which local communities depend. This report summarizes a suite of ecosystem indicators that track the status of the region's marine ecosystem. In total, 30 indicators are presented that include climate and oceanic drivers of ecosystem change, the states of ecological communities, and the activities and relationships between people and marine resources in West Hawai'i. Ecosystem indicators were identified through a collaborative and participatory process led by the West Hawai'i Integrated Ecosystem Assessment, a NOAA program dedicated to providing robust scientific information that meets current and future marine management needs in the region. The marine environment is a substantial contributor to economic productivity and community well-being in West Hawai'i. Fisheries, in particular, are socially and culturally important, with the pelagics fishery (e.g., tunas and billfishes) serving as the largest commercial fishery in the region. Since 2003, the total catch from the pelagics commercial fishery was over 6 times the combined commercial catch (by weight) of all other commercial fisheries and represented 62.3% of the total commercial fisheries revenue generated in West Hawai'i. Total catch of pelagics peaked in 2012 with 1.9 million pounds and $5.4 million in annual revenue. In recent years, the fishery has declined: total catch in 2017 was 1.02 million pounds, representing a 46% decline in just 5 years. Reef-fish fishing for recreational, subsistence, and cultural purposes (i.e., non-commercial) makes up the second largest fishery (by weight) in West Hawai'i. The estimated annual average catch was nearly 406,000 pounds from 2003 to 2013, representing an 11.5-, 2.7-, and 24-fold increase over the annual average commercial catch of bottomfish, coastal pelagics, and reef fish, respectively. In the most heavily fished coastal areas, such as between Puak\u014d and Kawaihae and near Kailua-Kona, approximately 29,000-33,000 pounds of reef fish were caught in an average year. As with the pelagic fishery, non-commercial reef fish catch has declined in recent years. Total catch was estimated at 265,200 pounds in 2013, approximately a 50% drop from the 525,600 pounds caught in 2008. In terms of economic value, the commercial aquarium fishery is the most valuable inshore commercial fishery and the second most valuable commercial fishery in West Hawai'i. Average annual revenue from commercial aquarium fishing in West Hawai'i was $1.35 million over the last 14 years, comprising nearly 25% of the revenue generated from all commercial fishing activities in the region. The average total number of individuals caught was approximately 360,000 per year since 2003, with juvenile yellow tang comprising over 80% of the fishery. More recently, total revenue has increased to an average of $1.58 million per year over the last 5 years with no significant change in the number of individuals caught. Coral reef fish indicators, such has fish abundance, size, diversity, and biomass, provide a fisheries independent assessment on the status and health of reef fish communities. Importantly, reef fish indicators provide a basis for evaluating the efficacy of the three primary management designations in West Hawai'i: marine protected areas (MPAs; prohibition of fishing), fish replenishment areas (FRAs; prohibition of aquarium fish collection only), and open areas (fishing allowed). Juvenile yellow tang, for example, have increased between 60 and 80% in the last 14 years across all three management designations in West Hawai'i, suggesting a potential spillover effect from managed to unmanaged areas. Herbivorous fishes, which are important for reef resilience, constitute roughly 50% of total fish biomass in the region. Herbivore biomass has not changed in open areas or FRAs in the past 14 years. However, herbivore biomass in MPAs has increased by nearly a third since 2003 and is currently (2017) 1.7 times greater compared to FRAs and open areas. In fact, all reef fish indicators-total abundance and biomass, adult fish length, species richness, herbivore biomass, juvenile yellow tang-were 1.1-2 times higher in MPAs over open areas in 2017. The significant differences in key fish indicators between management designations suggest a clear and positive influence of fisheries management on the structure and function of coral reef fish communities in protected areas. Despite the substantial contributions of commercial fishing, tourism represents the single largest source of economic activity in West Hawai'i. Visitor arrivals and visitor spending have steadily increased over the last decade, exceeding 1.3 million arrivals and $2.1 billion in spending in 2016. December is the highest month of visitor spending each year. It has increased 75%, or from $133 million to $233 million, over the past 15 years. Alongside visitor growth, the resident population has steadily risen through time, increasing by over 3-fold since the 1970s. Approximately 45% of the Big Island's population currently lives in West Hawai'i. Over 25% of the resident population live one mile or less from the coast, and over 80% live within 5 miles. With steadily increasing visitor arrivals and an increasing coastal resident population, the corresponding pressures of human activities, such as habitat degradation, fishing pressure, coastal development, and pollution are also increasing. Human wastewater, for example, is principally disposed via on-site sewage disposal systems (OSDS) in West Hawai'i. OSDS leach excess pollution and nutrients into groundwater that flows to the ocean, threatening human health and degrading marine ecosystem integrity. An estimated 680 million gallons of wastewater was released into West Hawai'i's coastal environment in 2017. The highest concentrations of OSDS (>800 OSDS/km2) are located in the vicinity of Kailua-Kona, where 125 million gallons of wastewater and 87,500 pounds of nitrogen enter nearshore waters each year. In addition to pressures from local human activities, variations in the physical environment are also driving changes to marine ecosystem structure and function in West Hawai'i. Ocean temperature, an indicator of regional and climatic forcing that is influential on numerous marine ecological processes, has been anomalously warm in recent years. The warmest year on record, 2015, resulted in widespread and severe coral bleaching in West Hawai'i. Approximately 50% of coral cover in the region was lost due to the warm temperature anomaly. Owing to climate change, ocean temperatures are projected to substantially increase by the middle of the century resulting in a 1\u00b0C (1.8\u00b0F) warming in monthly ocean temperatures compared to present-day. Importantly, projected ocean warming will cause severe coral bleaching similar to that experienced in 2015 on an annual basis by 2040 in West Hawai'i. The marine ecosystem in West Hawai'i is critically important to resident well-being and the economy vitality of the region. The ecosystem indicators presented herein provide a means for tracking ecosystem status and help evaluate the efficacy of existing marine management. This interdisciplinary report is intended to provide key insights and important context on the social-ecological system in West Hawai'i and support ecosystem-based management of this highly productive and biologically diverse system. West Hawai'i is home to a dynamic and productive marine ecosystem. Economic and socio-cultural value is provided to residents through numerous ecosystem services, such as commercial and non-commercial fishing, cultural and traditional practices, recreation, tourism, and coastal protection.

In 1998, the Hawai'i State Legislature passed Act 306, which established the West Hawai'i Regional Fishery Management Area (WHRFMA). The WHRFMA was created largely in response to public concerns regarding an expanding and unregulated aquarium fishery. The overarching purposes of the WHRFMA were three-fold: 1. Effectively manage fishery activities to ensure sustainability. 2. Enhance nearshore resources. 3. Minimize conflicts of use. In 2000, the WHRFMA designated multiple marine managed areas encompassing approximately 35% of the coastal waters in West Hawai'i (Rossiter and Levine 2014;Tissot et al. 2004). These managed areas were designated as fish replenishment areas (FRAs), where aquarium fish collecting was prohibited. The geographical boundaries of the restricted areas were selected using biological data and local community input (Rossiter andLevine 2014, Tissot et al. 2009). Current marine management areas encompass a range of spatial extents and various levels of fishing restrictions ( Figure 1.1). Hawai'i highlighting current marine managed areas (MMAs). The categories shown on the map indicate the regulations for each MMA (with respect to reef fish only) which explicitly prohibit three broad gear categories (line, net, and spear) and aquarium collection. MMAs designated as \"other specific restrictions\" can include species-specific take limits or gear-specific restrictions that do not prohibit an entire gear category. All other categories displayed are not necessarily all encompassing within each MMA. For example, an MMA shown as prohibiting spearfishing may also restrict take of particular species, restrict the number of lines or hooks allowed per person, or prohibit lay netting but allow throw netting. The full no-take area at Ka'\u016bp\u016blehu went into effect in July 2016, as a 10-year no-take area. See Hawai'i DAR (http://dlnr.hawaii.gov/dar) for more information on marine management in West Hawai'i. A key stipulation in Act 306 was the requirement of substantive involvement of the community in resource management decisions. The West Hawai'i Fishery Council (WHFC; http://westhawaiifisherycouncil.org) was convened in 1998 to facilitate this requirement. Comprised of various stakeholders, community members, and user groups, the WHFC provided the vehicle for the community to directly participate in the development of resource management actions. In addition to the development of the network of FRAs and other measures, the WHFC has supported and facilitated the implementation of several marine management rules in the region: \u2022 The limitation of large-scale commercial lay netting while continuing to allow subsistence netting. \u2022 Ka'\u016bp\u016blehu Marine Reserve, a community-based initiative prohibiting the take of nearshore marine life for 10 years.

The indicators we selected track the status and trends at the individual species, functional group, and community levels. As described in more detail below, these indicators convey information specific to detecting fishing effects, ecosystem structure and function, and coral reef ecosystem resilience. Total Abundance -Fish density is a major factor determining the functional role and influence of reef fishes. Spatial and temporal variability in fish density is a product of numerous factors. For instance, fish abundance varies by habitat quality (Feary et al. 2007), environmental variability and its influence on population demography (i.e., recruitment and natural mortality) (Sale 2004), and fishing pressure (Friedlander & DeMartini 2002, Guillemot et al. 2014). The total abundance of nearshore fishes has shown a positive trend in all management areas-MPAs, FRAs, and open areas-across West Hawai'i since 2003 ( Figure 2.1, Total Abundance). Total abundance has increased by 28.9%, 36.0%, and 34.9% in MPAs, FRAs, and open areas, respectively (Table 2.1). Total abundance of fishes differed based on management status. For example, the total abundance of fish in 2017 was greater in MPAs compared to FRAs and open areas by 61.4% and 34.8% (Table 2.2). An anomalous recruitment pulse was observed in 2014 across a number of locations in the state (Talbot 2014) and in West Hawai'i (Walsh 2014). The recent increase in fish abundance observed across management areas may be attributed in part to high levels of recruitment in 2014. Total Fish Biomass -Total fish biomass conveys related but slightly different information compared to total fish abundance. Specifically, two reefs might have the same abundance but very different biomass estimates based on the size distribution of fishes in the assemblage. It is useful to consider biomass in addition to abundance because the ecological function or importance of fishes on a reef is often related to the size of fishes (see herbivore biomass description below). In addition, the status of the fishery is more directly related to fish population biomass rather than solely on the number of fish (Guillemot et al. 2014). Total fish biomass, which is the body weight of the entire reef-fish assemblage per unit area, has increased in FRAs by nearly 40% since 2003 ( Figure 2.1, Total Biomass; Table 1). Total biomass showed no significant change in MPAs or open areas over the same time period ( Table 1). The most recent survey indicated that total fish biomass in MPAs was nearly 80% higher compared to FRAs and twice the biomass in open areas (Table 2)."}, {"section_title": "Adult Fish Mean", "text": "Length -As fishing pressure increases, the average length of targeted species decreases (Ault et al. 2014, Nadon et al. 2015. This relationship exists because fishers tend to target large fishes, and because fishing mortality reduces the number of fishes that reach older and larger life stages. Previous work has found that reductions in mean length of the whole assemblage are indicative of a shift towards smaller species and/or smaller individuals of the same species, and that this can be driven by moderate levels of fishing pressure (Guillemot et al. 2014). Adult fish length, or the mean length (cm) of mature fishes (i.e., fishes reaching \u226540% of their maximum length), increased by 5.3% in FRAs with no significant change in MPAs or open areas since 2003 ( Figure 2.1, Adult Fish Length; Table 2.1). In terms of management status, adult fish length in 2017 was approximately 11% greater in MPAs and FRAs compared to open areas (Table 2.2). Species Richness -Coral reefs are renowned for being one of the most diverse and complex ecosystems on the planet, providing important ecosystem services. The majority of tourists that visit Hawai'i engage in marine-based activities, including diving and snorkeling (Beukering & Cesar 2004), and fish diversity is one amongst a variety of factors that drives visitor destination choice (Uyarra et al. 2005). In addition to the aesthetic value, biodiversity is intrinsically linked to ecosystem function, and greater species diversity supports more productive fisheries (Moberg & Folke 1999, McClanahan et al. 2011). Species richness, or the total number of species present per survey, has not changed within each management area over the last 15 years ( Figure 2.1, Species Richness; Table 2.1). As with other fish indicators, species richness in 2017 was greatest in MPAs compared to FRAs and open areas (Table 2.2). Note: visual surveys of reef fishes do not capture all species present in an area; therefore, the data here are considered a relative measure of species richness, which is one measure of biological diversity. Herbivore Biomass -Herbivores (i.e., species for which plant material makes up a majority of their diet) comprise a large part of the fish community assemblage in Hawai'i (Williams et al. 2015b). Herbivorous fishes are a key component and indicator of resilience. Resilience is defined as the ability of a reef to maintain or recover to a coral dominated state following disturbance and avoiding a phase-shift into algal dominance (Green & Bellwood 2009). Multiple anthropogenic drivers operating at various scales can undermine coral reef resilience, such as over-extraction of herbivores, pollution, and climate change. Of these, the diminished abundance of functionally important herbivores is one of the few drivers that is possible to ameliorate through local action. Herbivore biomass, which represents the total weight of herbivorous fishes per unit area, increased by 30.8% in MPAs from 2003 to 2017 ( Figure 2.1, Herbivore Biomass;  (Table 2.2). Of note, herbivores in West Hawai'i constitute roughly half of the total biomass in each of the management areas. Juvenile yellow tang -The yellow tang is important to the West Hawai'i aquarium industry as it is the primary species collected (Walsh et al. 2003). In fact, the majority of the aquarium trade sources fish from West Hawai'i; approximately 70-80% of the fish caught in the state are from West Hawai'i with juvenile yellow tang comprising ~82% of the total catch (Walsh et al. 2013). Therefore, the status of this fish around West Hawai'i is of high relevance for fisheries management. Observed declines in reef fishes due to the aquarium trade triggered the establishment of FRAs and associated monitoring surveys in West Hawai'i in 1999. The data presented here are collected as part of the long-term monitoring conducted to assess the efficacy of this network of closed areas, which have proven over time to be highly effective in increasing the density of these long-lived species. Collectors target young juveniles, and as such, we report juvenile yellow tang abundance here.  "}, {"section_title": "BENTHIC CORAL REEF COMMUNITIES", "text": "Coral reef development and persistence are reliant on benthic, sessile organisms that deposit calcium carbonate, namely hard (Scleractinian) corals and crustose coralline algae (CCA). Fleshy algae, such as turf and various forms of erect macroalgae, also serve important ecological functions, such as providing food resources for several reef fishes (Mumby et al. 2006). In the absence of local human pressures, calcifying organisms tend to dominate coral reef benthic ecosystems (Williams et al. 2015a). Although variations in environmental forcing can tip the competitive balance in favor of fleshy algae on remote, undisturbed reefs (Gove et al. 2015), human-related pressures are more often responsible for shifting reef communities towards a dominance of weedy, faster growing algal species (Pandolfi et al. 2005). Monitoring changes in benthic community organization is, therefore, critical to understanding coral reef community succession and responses to various environmental and human-related pressures. We present a few key indicators that track the status and trends in ecological function and integrity of benthic coral reef communities. Hard Coral Cover -The total cover of hard coral (Scleractinian) in a given area generally corresponds with the amount of reef topographic complexity, habitat structure, reef accretion, and diversity and abundance of coraldependent species (McClanahan et al. 2011). Many reef-fish species are also heavily reliant on the availability of coral-dominated, structurally-complex areas, serving as the preferred habitat for fish recruitment and fish in juvenile stages (Walsh 1984). The total cover of hard coral across West Hawai'i was approximately 18% in 2017, representing a relative change of -52.5%, -57.8%, and -48.7% in MPAs, FRAs, and open areas since 2003, respectively ( Figure 2.3, Hard Coral Cover; Table 2.1). Much of the coral loss can be attributed to a thermal stress event in 2015, when up to 90% of corals bleached across West Hawai'i (Kramer et al. 2016 -see Section 3 for more detail on the thermal stress event). It is important to note that coral cover was as high as 80% in specific locations (e.g., Puak\u014d) in the 1970s, indicating dramatic losses in coral cover in at least some locations over the past 40-50 years (Minton et al. 2012, Walsh et al. 2018. Total Algal Cover -Fleshy (i.e., non-calcifying) algae are part of a healthy reef community, providing food for a variety of herbivorous fishes and invertebrates. However, fleshy algae can grow rapidly and compete with hard corals for reef space, inhibit coral recruitment, and reduce coral survival (Hughes et al. 2007). Tracking the abundance of macroalgae and turf algae (i.e., total algal cover) serves as an indicator of benthic community organization, intensity of herbivory, and local pressures, such as nutrient enrichment (McClanahan et al. 2002). Fleshy algal cover has increased across West Hawai'i since 2003; however, FRAs are the only management area that exhibited a significant increase (Figure 2.3, Total Algal Cover; Table 2.1). In the most recent survey, fleshy algal cover was approximately 55%, with no significant difference in cover between MPAs, FRAs, and open areas (Table 2.2). Changes in algal cover across West Hawai'i are predominantly due to changes in turf algae, as West Hawai'i has very low (<2%) macroalgae percent cover (Walsh 2014, Williams et al. 2015b. Calcified to Non-calcified Ratio -Foundational benthic organisms that contribute to coral reef development and persistence are calcifying, serving a number of key ecological processes, including settlement, recruitment, and cementation of reef structure (Williams et al. 2015a). Fleshy algae directly compete with calcifying organisms for space, and in high abundance, can indicate a degraded ecological state (Hughes et al. 2010). The ratio of the combined cover of reef-building hard corals (Scleractinian) and calcifying algae (crustose coralline algae and Halimeda) to the combined cover of fleshy algae indicates benthic community dynamics and the extent to which a given system is dominated by reef-accreting benthic organisms. In 2017, the ratio of calcified to non-calcified cover across West Hawai'i was \u22641 (Figure 2.3, Calcified to Non-calcified Ratio). This threshold represents a relative dominance of non-calcifying benthic organisms. The relative dominance of reef builders to maintain net accretion is likely reef specific as oceanographic conditions, community structure, and local human impacts each play a role in overall reef growth. However, it seems logical that coral reef ecosystems with a greater abundance of reef builders will have higher rates of net reef growth and accretion compared to reefs dominated by non-calcifying organisms (Smith et al. 2016)."}, {"section_title": "CLIMATE AND OCEAN INDICATORS", "text": "Large-scale climate patterns shape the physical environment of marine organisms, influencing feeding, migration, and reproductive success.

Climate and oceanographic indicators are presented here to help track and predict changes in the natural environment of West Hawai'i's marine ecosystem. Sea Level -Long-term sea level rise can lead to chronic coastal erosion, coastal flooding, and drainage problems. Long-term sea level rise also exacerbates short-term fluctuations in coastal sea level driven by waves, storms, and extreme tides. Tracking the status and trends in sea level is critically important for coastal planning and management of nearshore marine ecosystems.  1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012  2014 2016 2018   Date   900   1000   1100   1200   1300   1400 Sea Level (mm)"}, {"section_title": "SEA LEVEL", "text": "Long-term sea level measurements (1990-2018) from Kawaihae indicate a clear positive trend (Figure 3.1), increasing by 0.27 m (0.89 ft) in the past 28 years. Over the next 30 to 70 years, properties, infrastructure, and critical habitat located on or near the West Hawai'i's shorelines will increasingly be flooded, eroded, or completely lost to the sea. Example areas that will be exposed to chronic flooding include Ka'\u016bp\u016blehu, Kawaihae, and South Point. Portions of the Hual\u0101lai Resort in Ka'\u016bp\u016blehu, an economically important tourist destination in North Kona, would be permanently flooded with 1 m (3.3 ft) of sea level rise, which is expected by the end of this century (Hawai'i Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptations Commission, 2017). As sea level continues to rise, low-lying, populated coastal communities, such as Puak\u014d would experience increased frequency and extent of flooding. Beaches, such as those between Kailua-Kona and Kawaihae, will increasingly be eroded and permanently lost. Native Hawaiian cultural and historical resources, many of which are located near the shoreline, will also be severely threatened and potentially lost with continued sea level rise.

Rainfall -The Hawaiian Islands have one of the most diverse rainfall patterns on Earth. Persistent trade winds, mountainous terrain, and diel heating and cooling of the land interact to produce areas of uplift in distinct spatial patterns associated with the islands' topography. The resulting clouds and rainfall produced by this uplift lead to dramatic differences in mean rainfall over short distances (Giambelluca et al. 2012). Rainfall patterns in West Hawai'i are somewhat unique for the Hawaiian Islands. Rainfall is principally driven by welldeveloped and reliable land and sea breezes owing to a combination of diel land heating and a blocking of the trade winds by Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea. This diurnal pattern is particularly strong during the summer months. Changes in rainfall will influence groundwater and surface water transport to the marine environment, which can impact nearshore salinity and temperature, as well as suspended sediment and nutrient concentrations. Monthly rainfall and the monthly Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) are shown from 1975 to 2018 from three locations in West Hawai'i: Waikoloa, Opihihale (Captain Cook), and H\u014dnaunau (Figure 3.2). The monthly SPI was developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and represents a standardized approach to calculate monthly rainfall, facilitating the comparison of rainfall anomalies from separate regions with differing climates (Keyantash 2018). In short, SPI standardizes rainfall at a given location and can be interpreted as the number of standard deviations by which the observed anomaly deviates from the long-term mean. SPI values of 1, 1.5, and 2 above/below zero represent rainfall conditions categorized as moderately wet/moderately dry, very wet/very dry, and extremely wet/extremely dry. More information on SPI is provided by NCAR (https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/ climate-data/standardized-precipitation-index-spi) and by NOAA's National Weather Service, Honolulu Forecast Office (http://www.prh.noaa.gov/hnl/hydro/pages/spi_web_page.php). The monthly SPI represents a standardized approach to calculate monthly rainfall, facilitating the comparison of rainfall anomalies from separate regions with differing climates (Keyantash 2018). In short, SPI standardizes rainfall at a given location, interpreted as the number of standard deviations by which the observed anomaly deviates from the long-term mean. The SPI provides the ability to assess rainfall patters as near normal (0, dashed line), extremely wet (2 standard deviations above the mean, purple line), very wet (1.5 standard deviations above the mean, blue line), moderately wet (1 standard deviation above the mean, green line), moderately dry (1 standard deviation below the mean green line), very dry (1.5 standard deviations below the mean, yellow line) and extremely dry (2 standard deviations below the mean, red line).

The highest rainfall event over the 42-year time series was at H\u014dnaunau in September 2015, when 86 in (2,183 mm) of rain was recorded in a single month. SPI values from each of the three locations show periods of very wet (e.g., 1980, 1989, 1997) and very dry (e.g., 1995, 2003 2010) conditions (Figure 3.2, SPI). The overarching trend over the 42 years has been a shift towards dryer conditions. The total number of months that exceeded the very dry threshold (-1.5) at Waikoloa, Opihihale, and H\u014dnaunau was 2.6, 2.3, and 1.9 times higher during the most recent 20-year time period (1997-2016) compared to the previous 20 years . Conversely, the two time periods were nearly similar (between 80 and 100%) with respect to the number of months that exceeded the very wet threshold (1.5). Sea Surface Temperature -Surface ocean temperatures in Hawai'i can vary over a broad range of temporal scales owing to the oceanic setting and geographic location in the central-northern Pacific. Diel, intra-seasonal (e.g., mesoscale eddies), seasonal, interannual (e.g., ENSO), and decadal (e.g., PDO) forcing, as well as fluctuations in the rotational speed of the subtropical gyre all influence ocean temperatures in the main Hawaiian Islands. Seasonal and interannual variability are readily discernible in ocean temperatures dating back to 1900 (Figure 3.3). Seasonally, ocean temperatures are coolest in March (24.8\u00b0C; 76.6\u00b0F) and warmest in September (27\u00b0C; 80.6\u00b0F). This seasonal cycle can be shifted, accentuated, or dampened over longer time scales owing to large-scale ocean-atmosphere climate phenomena. Ocean temperature in 2015 clearly stands out as the warmest on record in Hawai'i due to the confluence of local conditions and large-scale processes. We provide a generalized description of this anomalously warm year in the following section.  Sea surface temperature (SST) in the main Hawaiian Islands reached the highest recorded monthly temperature in well over a century (Figure 3.3). Temperatures in West Hawai'i were even warmer, reaching 30.3\u00b0C (86.5\u00b0F) in September of 2015 (Gove et al. 2016). These anomalously warm and prolonged ocean conditions wreaked havoc on coral reefs in West Hawai'i, causing upwards of 90% of coral bleaching and an overall relative loss of approximately 50% of coral cover across West Hawai'i (Kramer et al. 2016). Although the dynamics governing ocean temperatures can be complex, it appears that the combination of local conditions and large-scale climate processes superimposed to produce the extremely warm temperatures observed in Hawai'i in the summer of 2015. Here, we provide a descriptive and generalized explanation of this anomaly. One source of variation in ocean temperatures is driven by the speed of the Subtropical Gyre, a ring-link system of ocean currents rotating clockwise across the North Pacific (Figure 3.4). Ocean currents in the Subtropical Gyre transport cooler waters from the northeast Pacific to the west and south, warming as it moves to the subtropical Pacific and the vicinity of Hawai'i. Similarly, warm water from the western subtropical Pacific is transported towards Japan, cooling as it moves northward. When the rotational speed of ocean currents in the Subtropical Gyre is accelerated, cool waters from the northeast take less time to reach Hawai'i, arriving cooler than normal, while the warm water in the western Pacific arrives warmer when it reaches Japan (Figure 3.4, Fast Gyre). Conversely, when the rotational speed of ocean currents in the Subtropical Gyre are slowed, cool waters from the northeast take more time to reach Hawai'i and, therefore, arrive warmer than normal ( Figure 3.4, Slow Gyre).  The North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) is an indicator of the variation in the rotational speed of ocean currents in the Subtropical Gyre (Di Lorenzo et al. 2008). When comparing the NPGO and sea surface temperature in Hawai'i, there is clearly a negative correlation-warmer SST is coincident with a lower NPGO, or slower Subtropical Gyre, and vice versa ( Figure 3.4, Sea Surface Temperature vs. North Pacific Gyre Oscillation). The NPGO captures much of the decadal variation in SST around Hawai'i, including the warm temperatures observed in 2015. However, while September 2015 represented a decadal peak in SST, the NPGO alone was not sufficient to result in such anomalously warm ocean temperatures. In addition to the rotational speed of the Subtropical Gyre, two other broad-scale climate processes can drive variation in ocean temperatures around Hawai'i. The first is the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). ENSO is an irregular (3-7 years), ocean-atmosphere climate phenomenon. El Ni\u00f1o represents the warm phase of the ENSO cycle, characterized by weakening of the trade winds across much of the Pacific and warming of ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific (Figure 3.5). El Ni\u00f1o events typically last 9-15 months, with peak forcing occurring in the northern hemisphere winter. La Ni\u00f1a represents the cool phase and is associated with stronger than normal trade winds and the anomalously cool ocean temperatures (Philander 1990). On average, La Ni\u00f1a is a less extreme anomaly than El Ni\u00f1o but tends to last longer, approximately 1-3 years. The second major climatic driver of changes in ocean temperatures in Hawai'i is the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The PDO is often described as a long-lived ENSO-like pattern of Pacific climate variability. As seen with the better-known ENSO, extremes in the PDO pattern are marked by widespread variations in temperature, wind patterns, ocean mixing, and biological productivity (Polovina et al. 1994). The extreme phases of the PDO have been classified as either warm or cool, defined by ocean temperature anomalies in the northeast and tropical Pacific Ocean (Figure 3.5). In 2015, there was both a powerful El Ni\u00f1o and a warm phase of the PDO (Figure 3.6, ENSO & PDO Time Series), resulting in higher local ocean temperatures than either alone would typically produce. In 2014 and 2015, the equatorial and mid-latitude connection between the El Ni\u00f1o and warm phase of the PDO is thought to have been especially strong, resulting in the largest marine heat wave (i.e., \"The Blob\") ever recorded in the Northeast Pacific that caused enhanced ocean warming across the Hawaiian Islands (Di Lorenzo & Mantua 2016).   On a local scale, variations in wind conditions likely exacerbated the warming induced by the large-scale climate processes previously described. When winds are weaker than normal, they decrease the intensity of ocean mixing, which reduces the amount of deeper, cooler waters reaching the surface ocean, and results in increased warming. Throughout August and early September of 2015, wind speeds were weaker than average over 80% of the time (Figure  3.7). During this same period, reef-level (10 m; 33 ft) temperatures from Lapakahi, located 16 km (~10 miles) north of Kawaihae, increased by over 2.5\u00b0C (4.6\u00b0F) (Figure 3.7). At the peak of the warming event, local wind speeds were equal to or stronger than the long-term average for more than two weeks, helping to mix the upper surface and drive down ocean temperatures, ultimately contributing to the end of the 2015 thermal stress event. Thus, the typical seasonal cycle, reduced wind conditions, and the combination of three major large-scale climate phenomena-NPGO, ENSO, PDO-all contributed to producing the highly anomalous warm ocean temperature around Hawai'i in September 2015. Looking toward the future, ocean temperature in West Hawai'i is projected to steadily increase as a result of climate change (Figure 3.8). By the middle of the century, average monthly SST will be about 1\u00b0C (1.8\u00b0F) warmer than present-day, and for about 6 months of the year will be warmer than the present-day average September SST (27\u00b0C; 80.6\u00b0F) (van Hooidonk et al. 2016). Further, it is likely the climate models used in these projections do not fully capture the large-scale climate variability-NGPO, ENSO, PDO-that influence SST and, therefore, may underestimate future ocean temperatures in West Hawai'i.  "}, {"section_title": "SOCIAL INDICATORS", "text": "Human relationships with ocean environments are diverse, incorporating social, cultural, political, economic, and environmental dimensions (Kittinger et al. 2012, Cinner et al. 2013. Humans are an integral part of ecosystems and they can be both stressors and stewards of the natural environment. Correspondingly, social data contain information on a range of human activities (e.g., distribution, practices, and interactions). Ultimately, ecosystem-based management requires ecologically meaningful information coupled with diverse human uses and practices at operationally relevant spatial and temporal scales. Based on outcomes from stakeholder engagement (Ingram et al. 2018) and information from social-ecological work (e.g., Kittinger et al. 2012), we have identified a suite of social indicators for West Hawai'i's marine ecosystem. Our goal was to integrate dynamic and spatially explicit data on human uses, values, and governance. Information on human dimensions and social indicators can be direct inputs into ecosystem models as well as shape the direction of ecosystem-based management. This work is ongoing; the ultimate outcome will be to improve our ability to better assess West Hawai'i's ecosystem and to provide information on current and predicted states of ecosystem integrity under different scenarios. Population Growth -Human population growth can result in a range of pressures on marine ecosystems. As resident populations increase, so can impacts such as overuse and habitat degradation. Technological advances, management practices, engagement in stewardship, and regulatory actions can modify the status and trends of individual activities. Because historical and reliable time-series information on specific activities is often lacking, tracking resident population growth serves as a broad indicator of human activities that can either directly (e.g., fishing) or indirectly (e.g., new development) influence the integrity and function of marine ecosystems.  Figure 4.1) was obtained from the State of Hawai'i's Department of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism (DBEDT; http://dbedt.hawaii.gov/economic/ databook/). In 1831, approximately 45,800 people lived on the island. That number steadily decreased over the next 40 years, reaching a minimum of 16,000 in 1872. Resident population subsequently increased until the 1940s, when it began declining to a low of approximately 60,000 residents from 1959-1968. Since the beginning of the 1970s, the population of Hawai'i Island has rapidly increased by over three-fold to nearly 200,000 residents in 2016 (Figure 4.1). "}, {"section_title": "HUMAN POPULATION", "text": "The spatial distribution of the present-day resident population in West Hawai'i is highly concentrated along the coastline: over 25% live 1 mile or less from the coast and over 80% live within 5 miles (Figure 4.2). Areas with the highest density of residents include Kailua-Kona, Kalaoa, Waikoloa Village, and Waimea. Visitor Arrivals and Spending -Compared to other sectors, tourism is distinguished by both its size and share of Hawai'i's economy. In fact, tourism expenditures represent the single largest source of economic activity in Hawai'i (State of Hawai'i DBEDT 2006). Moreover, many visitors spend the majority of their vacations at Hawai'i's beaches and nearshore environment. Beach and water sports, such as swimming, snorkeling, and scuba diving, are by far the most popular recreational activities among visitors (State of Hawai'i DBEDT 2006). Visitor arrivals and visitor spending for West Hawai'i was obtained from State of Hawai'i DBEDT (Figures 4.3 and  4.4) and serve as indicators of tourism use of the marine environment and the importance of tourism to the local economy. From 1990 to 2016, visitor arrivals to Kona increased by over 30%, with approximately 992,000 arrivals in 1990 and over 1.3 million in 2016 ( Figure 4.3, Visitor Arrivals). Between 70 and 80% of total arrivals are domestic visitors. The total number of days spent by all visitors in West Hawai'i has increased nearly twofold, from approximately 4.93 to 9.35 million days (Figure 4.3, Visitor Days). Further, the average length of stay has increased 42% over the last 27 years, from an average of 4.97 to 7.05 days. Annual visitor spending in West Hawai'i increased by 62% since 2004, to nearly 2.1 billion dollars in 2016 ( Figure 4.4, Annual Spending). Visitor spending is highly seasonal, with peaks in both wintertime (December/January) and summertime (June/July) ( Figure 4.4, Monthly Spending). December spending, which is the highest single month of visitor spending each year, increased by 75% over the 13-year time period, from 133 to 233 million dollars.  Impervious Surfaces -Land-based development can affect nearshore coastal environments by creating impervious surfaces, such as pavement, roads, buildings, and roof tops. These man-made surfaces prevent rainwater from being absorbed into the land. The modification of natural land into impervious surfaces increases the amount of runoff from streets and sidewalks and influences nearshore ocean salinity and temperature. We mapped the percent cover of impervious surfaces and estimated the potential runoff to the nearshore marine environment in 2017 ( Figure 4.5, Impervious Surface) using land use and land cover data from NOAA's Coastal Change Analysis Program (https://coast.noaa.gov/ccapftp). The highest density of impervious surfaces and associated runoff is near Ke\u0101hole Point, Kailua-Kona, and between Puak\u014d and Kawaihae. Overall, the total area of impervious surfaces increased by nearly 35% during 1992-2017, from approximately 81 km2 to 109 km2 (Figure 4.5, Total Impervious Surface Area).  . Below the map is a time series of total impervious surface area in West Hawai'i from 1992 to 2017 (bottom). Note the gray line in the map indicates the boundary of watersheds in West Hawai'i, which was used to enumerate the total area of impervious surfaces in the bar graph. Data Sources: NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP; https://coast.noaa. gov/ccapftp) and LANDSAT satellite imagery (https://landsat.usgs.gov). On-Site Sewage Disposal Systems (OSDS) -On-site sewage disposal systems (e.g., cesspools and septic tanks) and injection wells are common in much of West Hawai'i, where municipal sewer systems have not been constructed across a majority of the region. Nearly half of all OSDS in the state are located on Hawai'i Island, and nearly 85% of those are cesspools (Whittier & El-Kadi 2014), where the effluent receives no treatment prior to being released into the environment. OSDS can leach nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), pharmaceuticals, and pathogens into groundwater and streams that flow to the ocean. Abaya et al. (2018) performed a dye-tracer study in Puak\u014d, a community with homes located within a few hundred meters of the coast, and found that the travel time of wastewater to the nearshore waters ranged from 9 hours to 3 days. This runoff can result in algal overgrowth of corals, increased coral disease, and potential disease threats to humans (Anderson et al. 2002). We have included the following indicators based on Hawai'i's Department of Health (http://health.hawaii.gov/sdwb) information to capture the influence of OSDS and injection wells (henceforth referred to simply as OSDS) on the marine environment: total number of OSDS, total effluent released, and total nitrogen flux (Figure 4.6). All indicators were compiled taking into account the time wastewater takes to reach the coastline. Specifically, we only included OSDS located from the shoreline to the one-year time of travel line of ground water (TOT; Figure 4.6, black line). The one-year TOT demarcation was chosen to indicate the likely intrusion of pathogens and nutrients to the nearshore, thereby capturing the potential impact of wastewater on human and ecological health (Whittier & El-Kadi 2014). It should be noted that the amount of nitrogen from wastewater that enters the groundwater is considered highly conservative and will likely reach the coast even when the source OSDS lies well beyond the one-year travel line. The values presented here are therefore a conservative estimate of the total effluent and nitrogen flux actually reaching the coastline.  The spatial distributions of all three indicators are shown from the most recent data available (2017), as well as a time series extending from 2000 to 2017 (Figure 4.6). The maximum concentration of OSDS (818 OSDS/km2) within the block that spans from Ke\u0101hole Point to Miloli'i, with an average annual catch of 8,400 lb (Figure 4.7,Commercial Catch). Total catch for all of West Hawai'i varied over six-fold across the 15-year time period, ranging from a low of 5,500 lb in 2004, to a high of 34,400 lb in 2010 (Figure 4.7,Annual Commercial Catch). As with non-commercial catch, line fishing was by far the dominant gear type, ranging from 60 to 100% of the commercial reef fish catch. The dominant reef fish species caught in the commercial fishery, by weight, are '\u016b'\u016b, or menpachi (soldierfish, Myripristis spp.) and uku (gray jobfish, Aprion virescens), which combined account for 70% of the catch. When compared to non-commercial catch, commercial reef fish fishing is a very small fraction (1/24) of the total catch from coral reef ecosystems in West Hawai'i.  Reef Fish Fishing: Commercial Aquarium Collection -Aquarium collection is the live capture of ornamental aquatic organisms for sale in the aquarium industry. Commercial aquarium collection is the most economically valuable commercial inshore fishery in the state (Walsh et al. 2013). Aquarium collectors typically target juvenile fish, and catch is reported in number of individuals taken rather than by weight. As with other commercial fisheries, total catch is recorded by reporting block (e.g., Figure 4.7, Commercial Catch). However, in 2013, smaller reporting blocks, or subzones, were implemented specifically for aquarium collection in West Hawai'i. Here, we report annual average aquarium catch by subzone from 2013 to 2017 to provide greater spatial resolution on the take of aquarium fishes (Figure 4.8, Commercial Aquarium Catch); however, total commercial aquarium catch is provided, by species, from 2003 to 2017 (Figure 4.8, Annual Commercial Aquarium Catch).  The average annual commercial aquarium catch differs greatly along West Hawai'i. For example, 80-85 thousand individual fish are caught per year in the reporting block that spans north from Ke\u0101hole Point to Waikoloa (Figure  4.7, Commercial Aquarium Catch), which comprises 25% of the total catch in an average year. In contrast, fewer than 10,000 individuals were caught from the reporting block that spans south from Ke\u0101hole Point to Kailua-Kona. The total catch across the region from 2003 to 2017 was, on average, approximately 360,000 individual fish per year (Figure 4.7, Annual Commercial Aquarium Total). However, large year-to-year differences were observed, ranging from an industry maximum of over 452,000 individuals in 2004, to a minimum 288,072 individuals in 2009, a difference of more than 160,000 individuals. Laui'pala (yellow tang, Zebrasoma flavescens) is the most popular aquarium fish caught in West Hawai'i, accounting for 82% of average annual catch over the 15-year time period. Kole (goldring surgeonfish, Ctenochaetus strigosus) and p\u0101ku'iku'i (Achilles tang, Acanthurus achilles) account for 12% and 2.5% of average total catch, respectively, while all other species comprise less than 3% in an average year. In July 2017, the Hawai'i Circuit Court ruled that, based upon a Hawai'i Supreme Court opinion issued on September 6, 2017, existing 'aquarium' permits for use of fine mesh nets/traps to catch aquatic life for aquarium purposes were illegal and invalid pending a full review of the fishery under the Hawai'i Environmental Policy Act. Although collecting was still allowed as long as fine mesh nets/traps were not used, total catch in 2017 would presumably have been higher if not for the ruling. In January 2018, DLNR announced that after applying a Hawai'i Supreme Court ruling from 2017 to the existing West Hawai'i Regional Fishery Management Area administrative rule (HAR \u00a713-60.4), no aquatic life may be taken for commercial aquarium purposes in West Hawai'i waters until an environmental review is completed. In July 2018, after review of two Final Environment Assessments (EAs) prepared by the Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council (PIJAC), Suzanne Case, the Chair of the Board of Land and Natural Resources, determined that the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was required. As of the writing of this report (Nov 2018), the West Hawai'i aquarium fishery is still closed. Commercial Fishing: Coastal Pelagics -We define coastal pelagic fishes as two species: akule (bigeye scad, Selar crumenophthalmus) and '\u014dpelu (mackerel scad, Decapterus macarellus). Though they can be found seasonally in large schools proximate to shore, they are distinguished from reef fish because they principally reside in nearshore pelagic waters. On average, nearly 80%, or 113,000 lb of coastal pelagic catch comes from one reporting block (101), which extends from Ke\u0101hole Point to Miloli'i ( Figure 4.8, Coastal Pelagics). '\u014cpelu dominate the coastal pelagic catch, comprising greater than 95% of the average annual catch (Figure 4.8, Annual Coastal Pelagics Catch). During the last 15 years, the total catch has shown an overall decline, with present day total catch (77,000 lb) approximately 1/3 of the total catch in 2003 (218,700 lb). Commercial Fishing: Bottom Fish -The most commonly caught bottomfish species, comprised of six deep water snapper species and one grouper, are referred to as the \"Deep 7. \" The Deep 7 are more actively managed than other fisheries, including annual catch limits, vessel registration, and reporting requirements. Bottomfish are primarily caught with deep-sea hand line in depths of approximately 300-1300 ft (~100-400 m). On average, nearly 1/3 of the total commercial bottomfish catch near West Hawai'i was reported in the block that includes North Kona and South Kohala (Figure 4.8, Bottomfish). However, the total catch across the region has varied considerably over the last 15 years, with a six-fold difference between the lowest catch (12,350 lb; 2004) and the highest catch (73,600 lb; 2009) ( Figure 4.8, Annual Bottomfish Catch). The dominant species caught in West Hawai'i was '\u014dpakapaka (pink snapper, Pristipomoides filamentosus), comprising approximately 52% of the annual catch by weight. Commercial Fishing: Pelagics -Pelagic species include some of the most highly recognizable food fish, such as tunas and mahimahi, as well as popular sport fishing species, like marlins and swordfish. Pelagics are typically large-bodied, fast-swimming fishes that live in pelagic waters with geographic ranges spanning much of the Pacific. Pelagics are the largest fishery in West Hawai'i in terms of both weight caught and estimated dollar value. In the vicinity of West Hawai'i, over 70% of the average annual commercial catch of pelagic fishes was from the two reporting blocks off South Kona (i.e., from Ke\u0101hole Point to Miloli'i) ( Figure 4.8, Pelagics). Tunas, namely ahi (bigeye and yellowfin tunas, Thunnus obesus and Thunnus albacares) and aku (skipjack tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis), comprise the largest proportion of catch, with an average of 62.5% over the 15-year time period (Figure 4.8, Annual Pelagics Catch). A'u (striped marlin, Kajikia audax), ono (wahoo, Acanthocybium solandri), and mahimahi (Coryphaena hippurus) each account for a similar share of average annual catch (13%, 13%, and 10%, respectively). Across all of West Hawai'i, the pelagic fishery averaged 1.24 million pounds of total catch per year, with a peak of 1.9 million pounds in 2012. In more recent years, the total catch has declined: the 2017 total catch was 1.023 million pounds, representing a 46% decline in just 5 years. Commercial Fishing Annual Revenue and Fisher Engagement -The annual revenue generated and the total fishers engaged in commercial fishing activities in West Hawai'i are shown from 2003 to 2016 in Figure 4.9. All data were obtained from the State of Hawai'i DAR dealer reports (Walsh et al. 2013, PIFSC 2018, specifically for fishers that live in West Hawai'i (based on fisher zip code). Revenue values were corrected for inflation to 2016 dollar amounts using the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Honolulu Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (www.bls.gov). The pelagics fishery is by far the most economically important to the region, generating a total of $47.4 million or 62.3% of the total revenue from all commercial fisheries in West Hawai'i over the 14-year time period ( Figure 4.9 Commercial Fishery Revenue). The commercial collection of aquarium fishes was the second largest fishery in total revenue, accounting for $18.9 million, or 24.9%. Bottomfish, coastal pelagics, and reef fish constituted 5.8%, 3.9%, and 2.5% of the total revenue generated, respectively. Each of the fisheries' revenue exhibited year-to-year differences. For example, bottomfish had over a four-fold change in annual revenue in just six years, increasing from a low of $135,670 in 2011 to a high of $571,114 in 2016.

The annual revenue generated from commercial fishing activities (top) and the total fishers engaged in commercial fishing (bottom) from 2003 to 2016. Commercial fisheries include those fishing for pelagics, aquarium fishes, bottomfish, coastal pelagics, and reef fish. Note that annual revenue for the commercial pelagics fishery and aquarium fishery are presented in millions of dollars (left y-axis) while all other fisheries are presented in hundreds of thousands of dollars (right y-axis). Annual reported revenues were obtained from the State of Hawai'i DAR dealer reports, specifically for fishers that live in West Hawai'i (based on fisher zip code). Revenue values were corrected for inflation to 2016 dollar amounts, using the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Honolulu Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (www.bls.gov). Data Source: NOAA Fisheries (https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/5610). Commercial aquarium fishery information was provided by William J. Walsh, State of Hawai'i DAR. As with total revenue, the total number of fishers engaged in commercial fishing in West Hawai'i varied over the 14-year time period, ranging between 446 and 546 fishers (Figure 4.9 Commercial Fisher Engagement). The number of commercial fishers in 2016 was 446, representing an 18% decline from the peak of 546 fishers in 2004. When comparing the total annual revenue with the total annual catch from each commercial fishery from 2003 to 2016, revenue and catch for pelagics, coastal pelagics, and reef fish were positively correlated (R2 = 0.71, 0.74, and 0.91, respectively; p < 0.05), indicating that in general, the greater the total catch, the greater the total revenue generated for a given commercial fishery. The annual revenue and total catch from both the aquarium fishery and the bottomfish fishery were not correlated, indicating that market value is driven by external factors beyond total catch. In addition, no correlation was found between the annual number of commercial fishers and the combined annual catch from all commercial fisheries, indicating that the number of fishers were not a primary driver in year-to-year fluctuations in total catch."}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY AND NEXT STEPS", "text": "Ecosystem indicators provide the ability to track the status of West Hawai'i's marine ecosystem. Here, we compiled 30 individual indicators identified via a combination of community and expert opinions, region-specific research results, and our current scientific understanding of sub-tropical marine ecosystems. Ecosystem indicators presented herein span a wide range of ecosystem components including social, ecological, climatic, and oceanic drivers of ecosystem change. From this synthesis of information, a number of key findings have emerged:"}, {"section_title": "Ecological Indicators", "text": "\u2022 The number of juvenile yellow tang has significantly increased between 60 and 80% in the last 14 years across all three management designations in West Hawai'i. \u2022 The total abundance of nearshore fishes has shown a positive trend in all management areas, increasing since 2003 by 28.9%, 36.0%, and 34.9% in MPAs, FRAs, and open areas, respectively. \u2022 The estimated annual average non-commercial reef fish catch was nearly 406,000 pounds from 2003 to 2013, representing an 11.5-, 2.7-, and 24-fold increase over the annual average commercial catch of bottomfish, coastal pelagics, and reef fish, respectively. \u2022 Herbivorous fishes showed no change in FRAs or open areas, but increased by nearly 1/3 since 2003 in MPAs. \u2022 Herbivores constitute about 50% of the total fish biomass in West Hawai'i. \u2022 All reef fish indicators-total abundance and biomass, adult fish length, species richness, herbivore biomass, juvenile yellow tang-were 1.1-2 times higher in MPAs than open areas in 2017. \u2022 The total cover of hard coral across West Hawai'i was approximately 18% in 2017, representing a relative decrease of 50% since 2003. ecosystem services (Ingram et al. 2018). Importantly, a majority of ecosystem services perceived as the most vulnerable to ecosystem change were found to be cultural ecosystem services, which are considered critical to human wellbeing. Cultural services foster and maintain a connection to place, identity, values, and experiences (Chan et al. 2012, Fish et al. 2016, Pascua et al. 2017. Cultural services are often intertwined and interconnected with other ecosystem services (Chan et al. 2011, Pascua et al. 2017. Therefore, attempting to manage a complex cultural service specifically and individually, without accounting for other services such as provisioning or supporting (Chan et al. 2012, Gould et al. 2015) is challenging. Hawai'i's non-commercial nearshore fishery is a clear example as it contributes to both subsistence (provisioning ecosystem service) and cultural ecosystem services such as knowledge transfer and social cohesion (Grafeld et al. 2017). As part of the West Hawai'i IEA, we have begun to identify domains of cultural ecosystem services related to human well-being, associated attributes (i.e., definitions or examples) of each domain, and potential indicators of cultural services (see Appendix A). We are currently conducting interviews with community members in West Hawai'i to refine this information and ensure its validity, relevancy, and applicability for West Hawai'i. It is our intention to develop a more robust suite of indicators that track the overall status of West Hawai'i's social ecological system, including the cultural services and human well-being within the region.
