[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Scientists are known to be a highly mobile group. 1 A recent study of postdoctoral researchers working in Europe in the life sciences, for example, found that 43 percent were working in a country different than that of origin (Empirica 2005 (Stephan 2012). Moreover, highly productive scientists are even more mobile than the underlying scientific population. Hunter et al. (2009), for example, found that 50 percent of all the highly-cited PhD physicists in the world work in a different country than that in which they were born. Levin and Stephan (1999) found exceptionally productive scientists and engineers working in the United States, defined by a number of measures, to have a higher probability of being foreign born and foreign educated than the underlying population of U.S. scientists. Despite the importance of the foreign born, it is difficult to make cross-country comparisons regarding the role of the foreign born and their country of origin because of problems that arise in collecting consistent data across countries. 2 Moreover, most countries have an incomplete picture of the migration patterns of scientists born in their country because of difficulty in tracking individuals working outside their country of origin. 3"}, {"section_title": "The GlobSci Survey", "text": "To provide consistent cross-country data on active researchers, we surveyed corresponding authors of articles published in 2009 in four fields of science who were studying or working in one of 16 \"core\" countries. 4 The four fields are biology, chemistry, earth and environmental sciences, and materials. They were chosen in part because 95 percent or more of 1 See, for example, Auriol (2010); Auriol (2007) and Emperica (2005). 2 Two recent studies have gathered data on mobility of doctorate holders: Careers of Doctorate Holders (CDH) developed by OECD and UNESCO (Auriol, 2010) and the MORE study (2011), funded by the European Commission. The CDH study focuses on all doctorate holders; data reported vary by date, depending upon country. 3 By way of example, the National Science Foundation's Survey of Doctorate Recipients does not track individuals. trained in the United States who subsequently leave the United States 4 The sixteen core countries are Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, U.S. all articles published in these disciplines contain the corresponding author's email address. 5 The survey was administered during the period February to June of 2011. Collectively these core countries produce about 70 percent of all articles published in these fields. 6 The only highproducing country not represented in the GlobSci survey is China, where efforts to field the webbased survey proved unsuccessful. For each specific discipline, we chose articles from a randomly picked selection of journals in each quartile of the Impact Factor distribution. (See Appendix for a discussion of the sampling methodology, survey administration and response rate bias; go to http://www.dig.polimi.it/uploads/media/GlobSci_survey.pdf to see a copy of the questionnaire). Response rates by country are given in Table 1. The overall response rate of 35.6 percent (unadjusted for non-deliverables) is 10 to 25 points higher than that for most web-based surveys (Sauermann and Roach 2011b). 7 The median country response rate was approximately the same. This resulted in 16,827 completed responses; an additional 2,356 respondents answered part but not all of the questions posed (40.6 percent of the sample). Response rates vary somewhat by country, being highest for Italy (63.3 percent) and lowest for Germany (26.2 percent). Ten countries had overall response rates between 32.0 and 36.5 percent. Differences likely reflect in part the degree to which similar populations of scientists have been surveyed in the recent past by other, unrelated studies. 8 (See Appendix for more details concerning response rate.)"}, {"section_title": "Immigration Patterns: Country of work or study 2011", "text": "Country of origin was determined by asking the respondent to report country of residence at age 18. Data for the 17,182 (36.3 percent of the sample) scientists for whom country of origin and country of residence in 2011 could be determined are summarized in the left hand panel (columns 1-3) of the  Countries also vary in the degree of diversity of immigrants who work in country, measured by the percent of immigrant researchers from the top-four source countries (fourcountry concentration rate, given in Table 3). High concentration rates indicate less diversity. Countries with the highest concentration rates are Japan and Switzerland (approximately six out of ten immigrant scientists working or studying there hail from one of four countries). Brazil The four-country concentration rate measures the percent of a country's foreign scientific population coming from the top four source countries. In order to provide a global measure of diversity of foreign born researchers and PhD students in each of the core countries, we compute the Herfindahl-Hirschman concentration index (H) of the shares of immigrants by current country, reported in column 2 of Table 3 (Hirschman, 1964). The H index is a standard indicator used to measure market concentration. For each core country i, the corresponding H index is computed as follows: where C is the total number of source countries and s j is the share of immigrants in country i from country j with respect to the total number of immigrants in country i. Higher values of the H index indicate higher geographic concentration of the immigrants, with an upper bound value of 100. The lower bound of the indicator is given by H=(1/C)*100. This would be the case for a core country that has the same number of immigrants from all possible source countries (127 countries in our dataset, with a corresponding lower bound of 0.79). By construction the indicator tends to give more weight to larger shares. Canada appears to have a relatively more diversified pattern of immigrants when we extend the analysis to all the source countries. The U.S. has the median value of diversification according to both the four-country concentration rate and the H index. Immigrant scientists were asked to evaluate the importance of fourteen possible reasons for coming to work in their current country of residence. Virtually no variation exists across country in response. The \"opportunity to improve my future career prospects\" and the presence of \"outstanding faculty, colleagues or research team\" trump all other reasons. (See Figure 1). \"Excellence/prestige of the foreign institution in my area of research\" and the \"opportunity to extend my network of international relationships\" tie for third place. Regardless of country, respondents list family reasons or fringe benefits last among reasons for coming to work in a foreign country. Figure 1 -Answers to question \"How important was each of the following factors behind your choice to take a postdoc, employment or academic job in a country different than the one where you resided at age 18?\" ranked by order of importance."}, {"section_title": "Emigration", "text": "A strength of the GlobSci survey is that it not only provides information on immigrants working or studying in one of the 16 core countries but it also provides information on the percent of scientists living in a core country at age 18 who were working or studying in 2011 in a core country, be it the same or different. This information is summarized in the right hand panel (columns 4-8) of Table 2 for the 15,115 respondents who lived in a core country at age 18 and provided full and consistent information on international experience(s). Probability weights were used to compute the reported rates given that response rates varied by country. 9 Once again we find considerable variation in the percent studying or working abroad. Not surprisingly, India heads the list with 39.8 percent of the scientists who lived there at age 18 working or studying in a different core country in 2011. But the country that has the second highest rate among the 16 is Switzerland, with approximately one third of its residents studying or working abroad in 2011. The Netherlands and the UK are next, with approximately one in 9 The weights used are the inverse of the response rate of the country where the observation was collected and thus weight observations by the probability of inclusion in the sampling design. The logic is that response rates arguably depend more on factors existing in the country of residence at the time the survey was fielded rather than on nationality. Thus Italians living in Germany will have more similar response rates to French living in Germany than to Italians living in Italy. Examples of such country factors are settings on anti-spam filters, versions and settings of browsers, periods of the year when researchers are particularly busy, such as national holidays, vacations, exam periods, term breaks, etc. four of their residents studying or working outside of country. The country with the lowest percent of emigrants is Japan (3.1 percent) but the United States is close to last at 5.0 percent, followed by Brazil and Spain. There is considerably less variation in the country of destination (column 6). Indeed, the Migrants from Sweden and Canada are the most likely to report that they will return home at some time in the future, with more than one in three answering affirmatively ( Figure 2) that they will, while less than one in five of the migrant scientists from the UK, Italy, Denmark and Belgium state that they plan to return at some time in the future. Indians working outside the country are less likely than the average emigrant to report that they plan to return. Close to one   percent for emigrants from Japan to a low of 47 percent for India. All respondents who indicated that they had studied or worked in a country different form their country of origin were asked whether or not they had subsequently returned. Those who had returned, were asked to rate the importance of the reasons behind their decision to return. The rating scale ranged from 1 to 5 with incremental steps of .1, where 1 was \"totally unimportant\" and 5 was \"extremely important.\" Average scores assigned by returnees to each of the motivations by country of origin (and return) are reported in Table 4.  Table 5 reports the percent that rated as \"important\" or \"very important\" the same motivations. Regardless of country, the most likely reason scientists give for returning to their country of origin is for \"personal or family reasons\" and \"personal and family reasons\" are most likely to be scored \"important\" or \"very important.\" Table 5 -How important was each of the following reasons behind your decision to return to the country where you lived when you were 18. Percent indicating \"important\" or \"extremely important\". Policy levers appear to be extremely important in attracting scientists to work or study abroad. Regardless of country, opportunities to improve one's future or the availability of outstanding faculty, colleagues or research teams prove the most important reasons for immigration. But policy levers appear to have played little role in pulling returning emigrants back to their home country. For these returnees, and regardless of country, \"personal or family reasons\" are the most important factor influencing the decision to return. It does not follow, however, that countries have no ability to influence the return decisions of emigrants living abroad. As noted above, emigrant scientists from a handful of countries report that whether or not they return in the future will depend in part on job market conditions. GlobSci is not without limitations. First, it is restricted to researchers who have published in one of 16 countries. Second it is limited to four fields of science. Third, due to problems encountered in administering the survey, China was excluded from the core countries studied. Fourth, GlobSci provides but a snapshot of scientists active in 2009, thereby limiting the ability to compare cohorts of scientists overtime. Despite these limitations, GlobSci represents the largest international survey of scientists working in these four fields at this time. The procedure produced a sample of unique article-corresponding author addresses of 47,304 scientists in 16 countries. The country panel sizes are highly variable. The smallest panel is Belgium (706) and the largest is the U.S. (14,059), reflecting differentials in country contributions to scientific publications. Table A-1 provides summary statistics on the panel of invited respondents by country and scientific discipline. We track two characteristics of the articles from which the email of the corresponding author was extracted: number of coauthors of the article and total citations received by the article as of February 2010 (Table A- "}, {"section_title": "A2. Survey administration and questionnaire", "text": "The main language of the survey is English. However, the questionnaire and the invitation emails were available in six other languages: French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese and Spanish. The online questionnaire was developed through the platform Qualtrics\u00ae that supports multiple languages. The survey administrator chose a primary language to use in emails and set the list of languages available for a specific country survey. The platform then automatically deploys the language in which the recipient has set her browser, and lets the respondent switch from one language to another at any point while filling-in the questionnaire. Table A-3 reports the languages used to administer the survey by country. Each panel member was emailed at most three times during February-June 2011 and asked to complete the web-based questionnaire. The platform recorded partial answers, allowing respondents to followup in additional rounds. The U.S. sample was divided into three blocks, due to the size of the sample. The questionnaire is available at http://www.dig.polimi.it/uploads/media/GlobSci_survey.pdf. "}, {"section_title": "A4. Non-response bias", "text": "We assess non-response bias along three dimensions. First, we compare early and late respondents; second, we compare respondents against non-respondents and third, we compare full-respondents against those who dropped-out. In all instances the comparison is done for two known characteristics for the entire panel and sample: total citations received by the underlying article and number of coauthors. Total citations arguably are positively correlated with the eminence of the scientist and could potentially reflect differentials in the propensity to answer related to how busy the respondent is. The number of co-authors is positively correlated with the amount of time it took to answer the questionnaire given that number of coauthors was a basis for a branching question in the survey. Therefore, the number of coauthors is potentially associated with dropping out of the survey. Tests for equality of means are performed for each pair of country samples. Mean differences by country for early and late respondents are reported in Table A-5. Early-respondents are those who completed the survey during the first and second round and late-respondents are those who completed the survey during third round. Regardless of country or measure, there is no significant difference at the 5 percent confidence level. Comparison statistics for non-respondents vs. respondents are reported in Table A-6. Authors of more highly-cited papers living in France, Italy, Spain and the U.S. are less likely to respond than those with lower-cited papers. Authors of papers with more co-authors living in Brazil, Germany, Italy and the U.S are also less likely to have answered.  Results of test comparisons for full-respondents against partial respondents (dropouts) are reported in Table A-7. Results indicate that more cited authors from Belgium were more likely to dropout. The opposite is true for more cited authors from India, who were more likely than less-cited authors to take the survey in full. Dutch authors with more coauthors are also more likely to have completed the survey in full. "}]
