[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The link between brain amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2), metabolism, and dementia symptoms remains a pressing question in Alzheimer's disease.

Whereas some studies suggest an association [1] [2] [3] , others refute that these pathological processes are directly related 4, 5 . The lack of association between these pathologies has been supported by studies, showing the absence of hypometabolism in some brain regions with high A\u03b2 load, as well as the presence of hypometabolism in other areas with low A\u03b2 concentrations 1, 6, 7 . Notably, the lack of association between regional A\u03b2 and hypometabolism contrasts with the idea of a direct deleterious effect of A\u03b2 on disease progression, as initially proposed in the A\u03b2 hypothesis 8 .\nOne possible explanation that links A\u03b2 with disease progression and integrates the aforementioned conflicting observations is the idea that regional hypometabolism is caused by the toxic effects of A\u03b2 aggregation from distant rather than topographically overlapping brain regions. Indeed, early observations using [ 18 F] fluorodeoxyglucose ([ 18 F]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) support this notion, by showing that brain damage may lead to hypometabolism in remote, but metabolically connected cortical areas [9] [10] [11] . These results highlight the possibility of a direct deleterious effect of A\u03b2 on distant hypometabolism, which might be being overlooked by the current biomarker studies.\nRegardless of the presence of a regional correlation between A\u03b2 and hypometabolism, it is well established that the topographic coexistence of these pathologies in some brain regions such as the posterior cingulate cortex constitutes a signature of forthcoming dementia symptoms [12] [13] [14] [15] . Also, studies have shown that either A\u03b2 or hypometabolism may be the first abnormality in these regions 16, 17 , and that cognitive changes may be potentiated by an interaction between these processes 18 . Together, these results indicate that although regional A\u03b2 may not be the cause of its overlapping hypometabolism, progression to dementia may be the result of local interactions between these pathologies.\nHere, we tested the hypothesis that distant and local A\u03b2 effects play a distinct role in the progression of AD. We find that distant A\u03b2 determines the region's metabolic vulnerability, whereas the synergy between this regional vulnerability with co-localized concentrations of A\u03b2 determines dementia. These results were obtained in cognitively normal (CN) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) individuals as well as transgenic rats that display A\u03b2 single pathology in the absence of other brain human proteinopathies, such as neurofibrillary tangles. We therefore conclude that the deleterious effect of A\u03b2 on the progression of AD occurs in a two-step process, in which distant A\u03b2 determines regional vulnerability and local A\u03b2 drives cognitive decline."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "A\u03b2 is unrelated to local hypometabolism. Demographics and key characteristics of the human population are summarized in Table 1 . Voxel-wise analysis of covariance showed that compared with CN A\u03b2-negative individuals, CN A\u03b2 positive and MCI A\u03b2 positive had reduced gray matter density in the medial temporal cortex ( Supplementary Fig. 1a, d ). CN A\u03b2 positive and MCI A\u03b2 positive had reduced metabolism in the precuneus, posterior cingulate, inferior parietal, and temporal cortices ( Supplementary  Fig. 1b, e) , and had widespread A\u03b2 deposition ( Supplementary  Fig. 1c, f) .\nVoxel-wise models showed that A\u03b2 was not locally associated with hypometabolism in CN A\u03b2-positive and MCI A\u03b2-positive individuals. On the other hand, these models showed that global A\u03b2 was associated with hypometabolism in the posterior cingulate, precuneus, lateral temporal, and inferior parietal cortices in CN A\u03b2 positive ( Fig. 1a, d ; Supplementary Fig. 2a ; and Supplementary Fig. 3a ) and MCI A\u03b2 positive ( Fig. 1b, e ; Supplementary Fig. 2b ; and Supplementary Fig. 3b ). In addition, a bootstrap-scheme supported that regional A\u03b2 did not affect the stability of the global A\u03b2 effects on hypometabolism in the models mentioned above ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ).\nWe further replicated the results found in humans using a cohort of 20 rats (10 homozygous McGill-R-Thy1-APP rats overexpressing human A\u03b2 precursor protein and 10 wild-type Wistar rats). They were 11-month-old, and the wild-type rats provided the means for determining that 11-month McGill-RThy1-APP transgenic rats presented mild cognitive symptoms, with a significant baseline genotype effect on the Morris Water Maze (MWM) (P = 0.03). In the transgenic A\u03b2 rats, voxel-wise regressions supported that local A\u03b2 and hypometabolism were unrelated to one another. On the other hand, the model revealed that global A\u03b2 load was strongly associated with hypometabolism in the retrosplenial (which corresponds to the posterior cingulate in humans 19 ), medial and lateral temporal, and inferior parietal cortices (Fig. 1c, f) .\nA\u03b2 leads to hypometabolism in functionally connected regions. In CN A\u03b2-negative (Fig. 2a) , CN A\u03b2-positive (Fig. 2b) , and MCI A\u03b2-positive (Fig. 2c) individuals, metabolic connectivity analysis showed that the regions comprising the brain's DMN in the precuneus, posterior cingulate, lateral temporal, inferior parietal, and medial prefrontal cortices were highly correlated with each other.\nPartial correlation matrices using anatomical segregated regions-of-interest revealed that A\u03b2 was negatively associated with metabolism in distant, but metabolically connected brain regions in CN A\u03b2-positive ( Fig. 2d) and MCI A\u03b2-positive ( Fig. 2e-l ; Supplementary Movie 1) individuals. Notably, the elements of the A\u03b2-glucose and glucose-glucose matrices were highly negatively correlated with one another in these individuals (r = \u22120.5, P < 0.0001), which reinforced the link between metabolic connectivity and A\u03b2 effect. Furthermore, the lack of correlation between the A\u03b2-glucose matrix elements and the Euclidean distance between regions (r = 0.1, P = 0.3294) supported that regions' proximity did not drive these correlations.\nVoxel-wise network analysis showed that A\u03b2 load in the precuneus, posterior cingulate, lateral temporal, inferior parietal, and medial prefrontal cortices were associated with distant, but within-DMN hypometabolism in CN A\u03b2-positive (Fig. 3) and MCI A\u03b2-positive ( Fig. 4b-f Similarly, inside segregated clusters, local A\u03b2 effects on hypometabolism were negligible in (f) transgenic A\u03b2 rats. In panels d-f, the dots and bars represent \u03b2 estimates and standard error, respectively, of the independent variables used in the models. Parametric images were FWER corrected at P < 0.05 and adjusted for age, gender, education, APOE \u03b54 status, p-tau, and gray matter (GM) density in humans, and age, gender, and gray matter density in rats NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10217-w regions comprising other brain networks, such as the limbic and ventral attention networks (Fig. 4g, h ). In the transgenic A\u03b2 rats, a voxel-wise regression analysis confirmed that A\u03b2 was associated with distant, rather than colocalized, hypometabolism (Fig. 5 ). As expected, there were no associations between A\u03b2 uptake and metabolism in the wild-type control rats.\nSynergy of A\u03b2 and local hypometabolism on cognitive decline. A voxel-wise interaction model showed that high local levels of A\u03b2 and low local levels of glucose uptake in the precuneus, posterior cingulate, inferior parietal, and lateral temporal cortices synergistically determined subsequent cognitive decline up to 5.6 years in MCI A\u03b2-positive individuals ( . In addition, a bootstrap analysis supported that the effect of the local interaction between A\u03b2 and metabolism on cognitive decline was not influenced by a global A\u03b2 effect ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Moreover, analysis of variance reinforced that the models with the interaction term best described the relationship between overlapping biomarkers and cognitive decline as compared with reduced models assessing: (1) only A\u03b2, (2) only metabolism, and (3) A\u03b2 plus metabolism, with a P < 0.0001 in all three cases. In CN A\u03b2-positive individuals, the aforementioned interaction was not significantly associated with cognitive decline.\nIn the transgenic A\u03b2 rats, a voxel-wise interaction model supported the synergy between A\u03b2 and overlapping hypometabolism in the retrosplenial, inferior parietal, and mediolateral temporal cortices as a determinant of cognitive decline over 8 months (Fig. 6b, d ). This interaction was absent in the wild-type control rats.\nDistant and local A\u03b2 effects on hypometabolism. Structured equation modeling (SEM) showed that the construct in which A\u03b2 occurring in distant regions drives hypometabolism, whereas the interaction between this hypometabolism and the co-localized A\u03b2 determines cognitive decline well describe AD progression (Fig. 7) ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In summary, our results suggest that A\u03b2 is related to vulnerability in distant brain regions functionally connected by the DMN, whereas the synergy between this vulnerability with local A\u03b2 levels is associated with the clinical progression to dementia (Fig. 8) . Remarkably, similar results in transgenic A\u03b2 rats, which do not form neurofibrillary tangles 20 , supported this model as an independent mechanism of cognitive deterioration.\nOur results suggest that the regional hypometabolism observed in AD may derive from distant A\u03b2 effects within brain regions connected by the DMN. This observation is supported by early studies showing that lesions in remote brain regions are associated with DMN hypometabolism [9] [10] [11] . For instance, studies in non-human primates show that localized surgical lesions lead to hypometabolism in metabolically connected brain areas, and that the severity of the inflicted lesion correlates with the degree of remote hypometabolism 11 . These studies suggest that this occurs due to a synaptic disconnection between the damaged and the remote brain region 11 . Based on these observations, one may argue that the regional patterns of hypometabolism in AD derive from a decreased synaptic input from distant, but DMN connected brain areas affected by A\u03b2. Also, we have shown that global A\u03b2 load, rather than local, is associated with regional DMN hypometabolism, which is in line with previous studies 4 . Expanding upon these studies, our findings indicate that this might be explained by the fact that A\u03b2 from several distant brain regions contributes to regional hypometabolism. Therefore, it seems reasonable that a global A\u03b2 composite contemplating all distant brain regions shows a better association with regional hypometabolism than merely local A\u03b2 levels. Altogether, our results corroborate the deleterious effects of A\u03b2 on the DMN as previously suggested by the network neurodegeneration hypothesis of AD 15, 21, 22 , by showing that A\u03b2 leads to hypometabolism in distant brain regions interconnected by the DMN, rather than locally, as inferred from the traditional view 22 .\nOn the other hand, our results support the synergy between A\u03b2 and topographically overlapping DMN vulnerability as a driving force behind dementia symptoms. It is well known that individuals might respond differently to A\u03b2 based on their capacity to compensate through the reconfiguration of pre-existent or recruitment of alternative synapses using the DMN 22, 23 4, 14, 24 , and metabolic connectivity has been shown to represent synaptic pathways in the human brain [25] [26] [27] . Thus, the hypometabolism in our results may indicate the dysfunction of the DMN in recruiting alternative synapses in the face of toxic effects of A\u03b2. As such, our model could be understood to mean that the toxic effects of A\u03b2 and the underlying local levels of DMN dysfunction in handling these toxic effects synergistically determine the severity of the subsequent cognitive deterioration. Together, these findings support that regional vulnerability to A\u03b2 plays an important role in the progression to AD and that this occurs through the decrease of the capacity of the DMN to compensate for the deleterious effects of A\u03b2 [28] [29] [30] .\nAlthough our results suggested that regional metabolic vulnerability depends on distant A\u03b2, other factors may potentiate this vulnerability in AD. Determinants of such vulnerability might include inflammatory agents and pathology related stressors that might lead to biochemical dysregulations, resulting in decreased synaptic exchanges and therefore hypometabolism 29, [31] [32] [33] . Other factors may include cerebral vascular diseases, systemic metabolic disorders, and allele variants implicated in brain plasticity and resilience [34] [35] [36] . Also, previous studies have proposed that APOE \u03b54 may lead to hypometabolism independently of A\u03b2 37, 38 . Recently, it has been shown that astrocytes play an important role in [ 18 F]FDG signal 39 . Since astrocytes have been associated with numerous mechanisms involving neuronal plasticity and transmission 40 , The bar graphs show the distribution of the significant voxels in the aforementioned statistical parametric maps across seven functional brain networks (DM default mode, FP frontoparietal, DA dorsal attention, VA ventral attention, limbic visual, SM somatomotor). Thus, the sum of the seven bars in each graph is 100%. A\u03b2 in the orbitofrontal, insular, and occipital pole cortices (gray dots) did not significantly associate with hypometabolism. Parametric images were FWER corrected at P < 0.05 and adjusted for age, gender, education, APOE \u03b54 status, p-tau, and gray matter density As previously reported by our group and others, interactions between A\u03b2 and tau proteins determine AD progression 34, 41, 42 . Since glucose metabolism is proposed to be closely linked to tau pathology 36 , the regional effects of hypometabolism in this study could be merely inferred as a proxy of neurofibrillary tangles. Therefore, we used the McGill-R-Thy1-APP rats overexpressing human A\u03b2 pathology to clarify our results. Remarkably, the similar results in our transgenic A\u03b2 rats, which do not form tangles 20 , supported the associations between A\u03b2 and DMN vulnerability as a tau-independent mechanism of cognitive deterioration. It is worth to mention that, although independent, this model is likely to be highly potentiated by neurofibrillary tangles, which is supported by the more markedly cognitive deterioration found in humans as compared with the transgenic A\u03b2 rats. Indeed, it is probable that the A\u03b2-induced metabolic vulnerability reported here will create a favorable environment, also for neurofibrillary tangles to determine cognitive decline. Importantly, the DMN is an evolutionarily conserved feature involved in the integration of cognitive abilities in humans and rodents 19, 43 . Fig . 6 The synergy of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) with overlapping hypometabolism drives cognitive decline. a The parametric map shows significant interactive effects at a voxel level between A\u03b2 and glucose uptake on MMSE worsening over up to 5.6 years in the precuneus, posterior cingulate, inferior parietal, and lateral temporal cortices in MCIs A\u03b2 positive (n = 170). The aforementioned interaction was not significantly associated with cognitive decline in CN A\u03b2 positive. b In transgenic A\u03b2 rats, significant voxel-wise interactive effects between A\u03b2 and glucose uptake on MWM worsening over 8 months were found in the retrosplenial cortex, which corresponds to the posterior cingulate in humans, inferior parietal, and mediobasal and lateral temporal cortices. The plots show the graphical representation of the interaction in (c) MCIs A\u03b2 positive (see Supplementary Movie 2) and in (d) transgenic A\u03b2 rats, where each parallel line represents a single subject. For longitudinal changes in MMSE and MWM, lower values indicate greater impairment. Parametric images were FWER corrected at P < 0.05 and adjusted for global A\u03b2, age, gender, education, APOE \u03b54 status, p-tau, gray matter density, and follow-up duration in humans, and adjusted for global A\u03b2, age, gender, and gray matter density in rats\nMethodological strengths of this study include the use of continuous biomarkers analyzed with a robust voxel-wise approach and the use of an animal model in a controlled experimental setting, which permitted assessing the effects of A\u03b2 on metabolism independent of possible confounding factors, such as neurofibrillary tangles. This study has methodological limitations. Our studied population represents a selfselected group of elderly individuals motivated to participate in an AD study. Therefore, these individuals may not represent a general elderly population. Importantly, the model proposed in this study should be confirmed by future studies using different populations and long-term sequential biomarkers and clinical observations performed at multiple time points. In a heterogeneous population such as MCIs, some individuals have early A\u03b2 deposition and may present a positive association between A\u03b2 and metabolism 44 , while others in later disease stages may present a negative association. Thus, these opposing phenomena in the same population may obscure the regional association between these biomarkers. Although we restricted our analyses to A\u03b2-positive individuals and adjusted the models for p-tau levels, we cannot exclude that other pathological processes than A\u03b2-such as tau aggregates, neuroinflammation, cholinergic depletion, cerebrovascular disease, \u03b1-synuclein, and TDP-43-have influenced the interpretation of these results 45 . Also, the lack of tau PET images is an important limitation of these results.\nMcGill-R-Thy1-APP rats develop A\u03b2 plaque and oligomeric species 46 . Since regional A\u03b2 load is highly associated with regional oligomeric A\u03b2 32 , the deleterious effects of A\u03b2 on metabolism reported here might reflect oligomers rather than fibrillar conformations. Also, there are large pathophysiological differences between human AD and transgenic models overexpressing A\u03b2. However, it is important to mention that the less aggressive progression of A\u03b2 in rats, compared with mice, makes this model more similar to the insidious disease progression of elderlies with sporadic AD. For instance, McGill-R-Thy1-APP mice and rats express exactly the same mutations, but rats present plaques at 6-9 months while mice do as early as at 4 months 20 . Importantly, the much larger brain size of rats (approximately five times bigger than mice) makes the identification of specific brain structures using techniques with low spatial resolution, such as PET, possible to be performed in this study 47 .\nTo conclude, our results suggest that within the brain's DMN, regional vulnerability is associated with distant A\u03b2, while the interaction between this vulnerability with local A\u03b2 is associated with dementia."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Human subjects. The data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, phases GO, and 2 (adni.loni.usc.edu). ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. ADNI study was conducted according to Good Clinical Practice guidelines, US 21CFR Part 50-Protection of Human Subjects, and Part 56-Institutional Review Boards, and pursuant to state and federal HIPAA regulations and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of each participating site (adni.loni.usc.edu). Written informed consent for the study was obtained from all participants and/or authorized representatives. We studied participants who had [ 18 F] FDG PET, [ 18 F]florbetapir PET, MRI, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-tau at baseline, as well as cognitive assessments at baseline and follow-up. Cognition was assessed with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test 30-min delayed recall, Trail Making Test Part A and B, and Boston Naming Test. For this study, we selected CN individuals and MCI A\u03b2-positive individuals. CN individuals had an MMSE score of 24 or higher, and a clinical dementia rating (CDR) of 0. MCIs had MMSE scores equal to or greater than 24, a CDR of 0.5, subjective and objective memory impairments, essentially normal activities of daily living, and were not demented (National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for probable AD 48 ). Individuals did not present other neuropsychiatric disorders (further information about ADNI cognitive tests and inclusion/exclusion criteria may be found at www. adni-info.org).\nAnimal use. We imaged and cognitively assessed 20 rats, 10 homozygous McGill-R-Thy1-APP rats overexpressing human A\u03b2 precursor protein 20 with the Swedish Multimodal analytical operations performed at every brain voxel. The illustration shows the analytical model developed to perform statistical operations on multiple scalar variables and with multiple imaging modalities at every brain voxel in humans and rats. Briefly, (a) the brain image data were retrieved from a 3D image space and converted to a 2D matrix in the image space for each subject. b Then, the image data were transformed into the processing space using artificial parcellation. c In the computational phase, the statistical modeling was performed in every brain voxel accounting for voxel and global PET uptake values, as well as voxel gray matter density and covariates. d Subsequently, statistical matrices were generated from the results and (e) transformed back to the 3D image space. f Finally, 3D parametric maps displaying the results of the regression models were generated. k = subjects, u = image slice, v = slice elements, m = artificial parcellation, n = elements in each parcellation double mutation (K670N, M671L 49 ) and the Indiana mutation (V717F 50 ), along with 10 wild-type Wistar rats. Half of the rats in each group were males. 54 . Further information and the schematic representation of the human imaging methods pipeline may be found elsewhere 34 and in the Supplementary Fig. 7 .\nRat imaging methods. MRIs were acquired using a Bruker 7T BioSpec 70/30 USR animal dedicated. First, the rats were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane/medical air, which was then maintained at 1-2% after placing the animals in the scanner, with the breathing at 20-30 breaths per min. We used a 37\u00b0C constant airflow to maintain the rats warm. The structural images were generated using the 7T Bruker standard 3D-True Fast Imaging with Steady State Precession (FISP) pulse sequence 55 . Gray matter density was computed using voxel-wise morphometry. PET images were acquired using a CTI Concorde R4 microPET for rodents (Siemens). PET scans used [ 18 F]NAV4694 tracer for imaging A\u03b2 and [ 18 F]FDG tracer for imaging glucose metabolism. In preparation for the scans, rats received anesthesia using 5% isoflurane, which was then maintained at 2% throughout the procedure. The animals underwent a 9-min transmission scan using a rotating 57 Co point source before each PET image acquisition. For [ 18 F]NAV4694, a 60-min dynamic emission scan began concomitantly with the bolus injection of the radiotracer via the tail vein. For [ 18 F]FDG, after fasting for 12 h, the animals received the radiotracer injection during the awake state via the tail vein. Then, a 20-min dynamic emission scan at 50 min post injection was performed. PET images were reconstructed using a maximum a posteriori algorithm and corrected for scattering, dead time, and decay. [ 18 F]NAV4694 non-displaceable binding potential (BP ND ) parametric images were generated using the Simplified Reference Tissue Method with the cerebellar gray matter as a reference 56 . [ 18 F]FDG SUVR images were generated using the pons as the reference region. PET images were coregistered to the animal's MRI and non-linearly transformed to a standardized rat brain space created based on the wild-type rats MRIs. PET images were spatially smoothed using a Gaussian kernel with a full-width at half-maximum of 2.4 mm. Further information and the schematic representation of the rat imaging methods pipeline may be found elsewhere 47 and in Supplementary Fig. 8 .\nHuman CSF analysis. CSF p-tau at threonine 181 was measured using a multiplex xMAP Luminex platform (Luminex Corp, Austin, TX) with INNO-BIA AlzBio3 immunoassay kit-based reagents (Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium) 57, 58 . Details about CSF acquisition and quantification can be found at www.adni-info.org.\nStatistical analysis. Regressions were performed using R Statistical Software Package version 3.1.2 (http://www.r-project.org/) to test for significant associations between biomarkers and also demographic differences between groups for continuous variables, whereas chi-square was used for categorical variables. The voxelwise analyses were performed using MATLAB software version 9.2 (http://www. mathworks.com) with a computational framework developed to perform complex voxel-wise statistical operations, such as interaction models, using multiple imaging modalities in humans and rats (Fig. 9) 59 . In humans, we evaluated the brain abnormalities associated with the clinical diagnosis using a voxel-wise analysis of variance, in which the signal intensity of the imaging modality was used as the dependent variable, while the diagnosis was used as the independent variable. Subsequently, voxel-wise regression models, taking into consideration voxel and global A\u03b2 concentrations, tested the association between A\u03b2 deposition and glucose metabolism in humans and rats. In humans, we also considered age, gender, education, APOE \u03b54 status, p-tau, and gray matter density in the models, whereas in rats, age, gender, and gray matter density were considered.\nThen, connectivity analysis was performed using eight regions-of-interest used to assess the global PET A\u03b2 value in the precuneus, posterior and anterior cingulate, inferior parietal, paracentral, medial prefrontal, lateral temporal, and orbitofrontal cortices as well as two additional regions in the insular and occipital cortices, using coordinates in the MNI ICBM atlas 60 . The edge values were assumed to be the correlation coefficients between regions, which were used as the matrix elements. Interregional correlation coefficients were computed using Pearson partial correlation analysis controlling for age, gender, education, APOE \u03b54 status, p-tau, and gray matter density. Metabolic connectivity was assessed with a symmetric matrix showing the strength of the correlation of glucose uptake between regions. An asymmetric matrix assessed the associations of A\u03b2 deposition and hypometabolism between regions-of-interest. The matrices were corrected for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni at P < 0.05. FDG-FDG and FDG-A\u03b2 matrix elements were further correlated using Pearson's correlation. We also tested the correlation between the matrix elements and the Euclidean distance between nodes (mm) to ensure that the results were not driven by regions' proximity.\nIn humans, we further performed a voxel-wise connectivity analysis using A\u03b2 values within the 10 regions-of-interest mentioned above as independent predictors and glucose metabolism at every voxel as the outcome accounting for age, gender, education, APOE \u03b54 status, p-tau, and gray matter density. In addition, a brain network atlas provided the means to assess the overlap between the results and functional networks (default mode, frontoparietal, dorsal and ventral attention, limbic, visual, and somatomotor networks 61 ). In rats, a voxel-wise connectivity analysis was performed using A\u03b2 values in eight regions-of-interest, based on previous literature, in retrosplenial, medial temporal, lateral temporal, inferior parietal, frontoparietal, olfactory bulb, cerebellar, and somatosensory cortices as independent predictors and glucose metabolism at every voxel as the outcome accounting for age, gender, and gray matter density 19, 43 .\nThe association between image biomarkers and cognitive changes was tested in humans with a voxel-wise model using the slope of change in cognitive performance as the dependent variable and the main and interactive effects of [ 18 F] florbetapir SUVR and [ 18 F]FDG SUVR at every voxel as independent predictors. The slope of change in cognitive performance was defined using all available MMSE evaluations for each subject with a mean of 4 (SD: 0.96) evaluations spanning up to 5.6 years (mean of 3.4 years (SD: 1.02)). The analysis was adjusted for global A\u03b2, age, gender, education, APOE \u03b54 status, p-tau, gray matter density, and follow-up duration. The voxel-wise interaction model was built as follows:\nIn rats, we built the same voxel-wise model performed in humans using the slope of change in the MWM as the dependent variable and the main and interactive effects of [ 18 F]NAV4694 BP ND and [ 18 F]FDG SUVR as independent predictors. A slope of change in cognitive performance was defined for each rat using the MWM changes in average (four trials) latency to find the platform over 8 months. The model was adjusted for global A\u03b2, age, gender, and gray matter density. The voxel-wise interaction model was built as follows:\nStatistical parametric maps were corrected for multiple comparisons, and the statistical significance was defined using a family-wise error rate (FWER) threshold of P < 0.05.\nThe presence of collinearity between regional and global A\u03b2 PET values could inflate the variance of estimates, potentially leading to incorrect the statistical results of significance when both effects are used in the same model. To assess whether such case occurred in our analysis, we investigated the stability of estimates by measuring the variance based on a resampling scheme repeated 10,000 times. In addition, the adequacy of the models with the interaction term was further assessed with an analysis of variance comparing the interaction model with each reduced model: (1) A\u03b2, (2) metabolism, and (3) A\u03b2 plus metabolism.\nThe relationship between A\u03b2, metabolism, and the longitudinal cognitive decline was further assessed via SEM using the R package Lavaan 62 . SEM was built to test the specific hypotheses demonstrated in the figure's meta-model 63 . SEM was classified as satisfactory whether: comparative fit index (CFI) > 0.95 and standardized root mean-square residual (SRMR) < 0.1 64 ."}, {"section_title": "Data availability", "text": "All human data used in this study were downloaded online at the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database (adni.loni.usc.edu).
