[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Using data (n \u03ed 3,790 with 2,119 in the 3-year-old cohort and 1,671 in the 4-year-old cohort) from 353 Head Start centers in the Head Start Impact Study, the only large-scale randomized experiment in Head Start history, this article examined the impact of Head Start on children's cognitive and parent-reported social-behavioral outcomes through first grade contingent on the child care arrangements used by children who were randomly assigned to the control group (i.e., parental care, relative/nonrelative care, another Head Start program, or other center-based care). A principal score matching approach was adopted to identify children assigned to Head Start who were similar to children in the control group with a specific care arrangement. Overall, the results showed that the effects of Head Start varied substantially contingent on the alternative child care arrangements. Compared with children in parental care and relative/nonrelative care, Head Start participants generally had better cognitive and parent-reported behavioral development, with some benefits of Head Start persisting through first grade; in contrast, few differences were found between Head Start and other center-based care. The results have implications regarding the children for whom Head Start is most beneficial as well as how well Head Start compares with other center-based programs."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Head Start has been the single largest publicly financed early childhood education and care program in the United States since its creation in 1965 as part of the War on Poverty. It aims to improve the school readiness of low-income preschool-age children, particularly 3-and 4-year olds, by providing high-quality and comprehensive early education and other services. Whether Head Start has been effective has been debated, in large part because until recently no randomized trial of Head Start had been conducted (Besharov & Call, 2009; Nisbett, 2009; Styfco & Zigler, 2004; see Camilli, Vargas, Ryan, & Barnett, 2010 , for a metaanalysis of randomized evaluations of other preschool education programs). One challenge for the nonexperimental Head Start studies, even those using the most rigorous methods (e.g., Currie & Thomas, 1995 , 1999 Deming, 2009; Garces, Thomas, & Currie, 2002; Lee, Zhai, Brooks-Gunn, Han, & Waldfogel, 2014; Ludwig & Miller, 2007; Zhai, Brooks-Gunn, & Waldfogel, 2011) , is to account adequately for selection bias, given that the program by design serves children who are economically disadvantaged and tend to have worse developmental outcomes than their more advantaged counterparts even before attending Head Start.\nIn the 1998 reauthorization of Head Start, Congress mandated that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (USDHHS) determine the impact of Head Start on the children it serves. Under this legislative mandate, the Head Start Impact Study (HSIS) selected a nationally representative sample of 3-and 4-year-old Head Start-eligible children and randomly assigned them to Head Start or control conditions. As the only large-scale randomized experiment in Head Start history, the HSIS reported short-term benefits of Head Start in multiple domains 1 year after random assignment, although few of these benefits were sustained through kindergarten or first or third grade (USDHHS, 2005 (USDHHS, , 2010 (USDHHS, , 2012 .\nHowever, because children in the HSIS experiment were randomized only to a treatment or control condition, the HSIS experimental analysis could not address the question of whether the effects of Head Start varied depending on the types of child care arrangements that children in the control group selected. To address this question, nonexperimental methods must be used.\nIn this analysis we used data from the HSIS to investigate how the effects of Head Start on children's cognitive and socialbehavioral outcomes varied contingent on the counterfactual child care arrangements to which it was compared by year and by cohort. Using a principal score approach (similar to that used by Hill, Waldfogel, & Brooks-Gunn, 2002) , we compared Head Start in the treatment group to specific care arrangements that children received in the control group, including parental care, relative/ nonrelative care, other Head Start programs, and other centerbased care. By taking into account variation in the counterfactual, this analysis provided a more detailed picture of how well Head Start worked for Head Start eligible children compared with other specific child care arrangements. The findings may have important implications for policymakers, in particular with regard to targeting children who otherwise would attend the least beneficial arrangements if they were not enrolled in Head Start and with regard to how well Head Start compares with other center-based programs."}, {"section_title": "Background and Literature Review", "text": "A common challenge in Head Start research has been how to account adequately for the issue of selection. Disadvantaged children are more likely than their more advantaged peers to attend Head Start and also to have worse developmental outcomes (Currie, 2005; Reid, Webster-Stratton, & Baydar, 2004) . To address this issue of selection, a number of observational studies have used rigorous statistical methods (e.g., family fixed effects, regression discontinuity, and propensity score matching) and found modest and significant short-and long-term benefits of Head Start (e.g., Currie & Thomas, 1995 , 1999 Deming, 2009; Garces et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2014; Ludwig & Miller, 2007; Zhai et al., 2011) .\nTo more conclusively address the issue of selection bias, the HSIS randomly assigned a nationally representative sample of 3-and 4-year-old children whose families applied to oversubscribed Head Start programs to either have access to Head Start (i.e., the treatment group) or to be placed on a waiting list (i.e., the control group). One year after random assignment, the HSIS reported significant benefits of Head Start in multiple domains (USDHHS, 2005) . For example, compared with children in the control group of the same age cohort, children in the treatment group had significantly better cognitive development as measured by higher scores on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) Receptive Vocabulary and the Woodcock-Johnson III (WJ-III) subscales in Letter-Word Identification and math in Applied Problems (effect sizes, calculated by regression coefficients divided by SDs of the measures, were 0.18, 0.26, and 0.15 in the 3-year-old cohort; and 0.09, 0.22, and not significant in the 4-year-old cohort, respectively). Children of the 3-year-old cohort in the treatment group also had lower scores on Hyperactive Behavior (effect sizes of 0.21) than their peers in the control group (not significant in the 4-year-old cohort). Nevertheless, few of these benefits persisted through kindergarten or thereafter (USDHHS, 2010 (USDHHS, , 2012 .\nThese estimated effects of Head Start on children's development, especially cognitive outcomes after 1-year participation in the HSIS, were smaller compared with those reported in earlier evaluations of model early interventions (e.g., Perry Preschool, Abecedarian, and the Infant Health and Development Program [IHDP] ; with short-term effect sizes of 0.35-0.97 on cognitive outcomes) (Brooks-Gunn, 2011; Camilli et al., 2010; Karoly, Kilburn, & Cannon, 2005; Ludwig & Phillips, 2007) . This difference may reflect the fact that the counterfactual has changed, given that few 3-and 4-year-old children in the 1960s to the 1980s attended any form of preschool if they did not have Head Start or other model early interventions evaluated in many prior studies while most of these age-groups of children today have some form of school-or center-based care (Waldfogel, 2006) . The noncompliance rates in the HSIS (i.e., 15% and 22% for no-shows of children who were assigned to the treatment group but did not attend Head Start and 16% and 13% for crossovers of children who were assigned to the control group but attended Head Start in the 3-and 4-year-old cohorts, respectively) were relatively high compared with those in the prior model early interventions, which may also indicate the increase in the number of preschool programs across the United States in the past decades.\nHowever, in many prior studies the counterfactual of child care arrangements to which Head Start is compared has not been clearly defined or directly examined. Children who do not attend Head Start are in a variety of alternative care settings, ranging from exclusive parental care to informal relative or nonrelative child care to other high-quality early education programs (Lee et al., 2014; Lee, Brooks-Gunn, & Schnur, 1988; USDHHS, 2005 USDHHS, , 2010 Zhai et al., 2011) . For example, in our analysis sample of the HSIS, in the control group 41% of the 3-year-old cohort and 38% of the 4-year-old cohort received only parental care, 18% and 11%, respectively, received relative/nonrelative care in the child's home or another home, 25% and 37%, respectively, received other center-based care, and 16% and 13%, respectively, attended another Head Start program (i.e., a Head Start program that was not part of the experimental study). Prior research has shown that the type and quality of child care arrangements are associated with children's developmental outcomes (Baydar & Brooks-Gunn, 1991; Duncan & the NICHD ECCRN, 2003; Gormley, 2008; Magnuson, Ruhm, & Waldfogel, 2007; NICHD Early Child Care Research Network [ECCRN], 2005; Smolensky & Gootman, 2003; Waldfogel, 2006) . Therefore, a comparison of Head Start to the specific care arrangements received by children in the control group would be informative, as shown by Hill et al. (2002) in the analysis of the IHDP, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of early childhood intervention services provided to low birth weight premature children in eight sites across the nation. Using a principal score matching method, Hill and colleagues found that the IHDP program had the largest benefits for children who otherwise would have received parental care. Similar findings on Head Start were obtained in two recent observational studies (Lee et al., 2014; Zhai et al., 2011) , which used data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B) and the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS), respectively, and found that Head Start was associated with improved cognitive outcomes compared with parental care or relative/nonrelative care, but was not different from other center-based care."}, {"section_title": "The Present Study", "text": "This study used data from the HSIS to examine the effects of Head Start on children's cognitive and parent-reported socialbehavioral outcomes by comparing Head Start in the treatment group to specific child care arrangements for children in the control group, including parental care, relative/nonrelative care, other Head Start programs, and other center-base care.

Following Hill et al. (2002) , a principal score approach was used to identify subgroups of children in the treatment group who, without the intervention, would have had child care arrangements similar to subgroups of children in the control group. Based on the findings from the randomized trial of IHDP using a similar procedure (Hill et al., 2002) and the nonexperimental analyses of two nationwide data sets using propensity score matching (Lee et al., 2014; Zhai et al., 2011) , we would expect Head Start to have the largest cognitive benefits when compared with parental care or relative/nonrelative care. The findings on the associations between child care arrangements and social-behavioral outcomes have been mixed in the literature. For example, some observational studies found that children who attended center-based care tended to have more behavior problems in preschool and elementary school years than children who had parental or relative care (Magnuson & Waldfogel, 2005; NICHD ECCRN, 2005) . In contrast, studies using RCT designs found reduced, or no elevated, behavior problems among children who attended high-quality early interventions (Hill et al., 2002; Love, Chazan-Cohen, Raikes, & Brooks-Gunn, 2013) . Because randomized assignment was used in the HSIS and Head Start generally provides comprehensive services to participants, we would expect Head Start to be associated with increased social skills and reduced behavior problems when compared with parental care or relative/ nonrelative care. In contrast, given the variation in the quality of both Head Start and other center-based care programs (e.g., USDHHS, 2005), we would expect to find few differential effects on cognitive or social-behavioral outcomes in the comparisons of Head Start in the treatment group to Head Start or other centerbased care in the control group. Because both the 3-and 4-year-old cohorts in the treatment group received Head Start, we would expect similar initial effects of Head Start by the end of the first Head Start year. Prior research found evidence that the length of participation (or program dosage) in high-quality interventions was associated with better developmental outcomes of children (Hill, Brooks-Gunn, & Waldfogel, 2003; Zhai et al., 2010) . Therefore, we would expect to find sustained effects in the 3-year-old cohort, in which most children in the treatment group attended Head Start for 2 years (USDHHS, 2010), more likely than in the 4-year-old cohort."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data and Analysis Sample", "text": "We used the restricted-use data from the HSIS for the analyses.

Data were collected from preschool to third grade between fall 2002 and spring 2008 (see USDHHS, 2005 USDHHS, , 2010 USDHHS, , 2012 , for the detailed procedures of design, sampling, random assignment, and data collection in the HSIS).

Information on social and behavioral development was reported by parents, including Social Skills and Positive Approaches to Learning, Aggressive Behavior, and Hyperactive Behavior.

For children in either the treatment or control group who were enrolled in Head Start, Head Start was always defined as the focal setting. For children in other arrangements (including those in multiple arrangements) that lasted at least 5 hr per week, the priority of coding the focal settings followed a hierarchical order of other center-based program, nonrelative's home, relative's home, nonparental care in the child's own home by a nonrelative, and nonparental care in the child's own home by a relative. The focal setting was parental care if children did not receive nonparental care for more than 5 hr per week. Relatively few children received nonparental, noncenterbased care, including relative or nonrelative care in the child's home or another home. Therefore, we combined these focal settings into a category of relative/nonrelative care. As a result, the child care arrangements in our analyses had four mutually exclusive categories, including Head Start, other center-based care, relative/nonrelative care, and parental care.\nIn all the regression analyses, as detailed below, we controlled for the same set of baseline covariates 3 that were used in the main or subgroup analyses in the HSIS reports. These child and family covariates, collected at baseline in fall 2002, could not have been influenced by Head Start participation but may have affected subsequent child outcomes. Prior research has demonstrated the importance of accounting for the potential confounding variables of child and family demographic characteristics in detecting the effects of preventive interventions, especially those targeting lowincome children (see, e.g., Aber, Brown, & Jones, 2003; Hill et al., 2002 Hill et al., , 2003 Lee et al., 2014; Love et al., 2013; Raver et al., 2009; Tolan, Gorman-Smith, & Henry, 2004; Zhai et al., 2011) . These covariates may also have affected the compliance with HSIS random assignment for families in the treatment group as well as the selection of child care arrangements for families in the control group. Therefore, including these covariates may increase the precision of analyses and their explanatory power to detect any true Head Start impacts on the outcomes of interest (USDHHS, 2010).\nSpecifically, child covariates included gender, race/ethnicity (White/Other, Black, or Hispanic), test language (English vs. Spanish/other) at baseline, and whether the child had special needs at baseline. In addition, following the HSIS reports, the models also included controls for age at spring assessment (in weeks). The HSIS also had measures of children's cognitive and behavioral outcomes administered in the fall 2002. In principle, we would want to include these measures in the models as controls for children's pretreatment scores. However, it should be noted that 2 The HSIS data also included a Withdrawn Behavior subscale containing three items of shy, withdrawn, or depressed behavior. However, the reliability of this measure was quite low (\u2423 \u03ed 0.41 in 3-year-old cohort and \u2423 \u03ed 0.38 in 4-year-old cohort in spring 2003).\n3 Sensitivity tests including additional covariates such as parent-reported depressive symptoms showed similar results to those reported below. Many of these additional covariates had missing data (e.g., 19% on parentreported depressive symptoms) and were correlated with those included in the models. Using the same set of covariates as in the HSIS reports may help avoid statistical issues such as multicollinearity and lack of common support in the matching process, as detailed below, and also keep consistent with the analyses in the HSIS reports. In addition, we did not control for variables collected after fall 2002, because they could either be subsequent treatments (e.g., second-year Head Start attendance in the 3-year-old cohort) or have been affected by child care arrangements. , especially when compared with the specific care arrangements in the 4-year-old cohort. Therefore, we did not control for these measures in the analyses, assuming children had similar pretreatment scores as a result of random assignment. As in the analyses in the HSIS reports, we also controlled for parent and family covariates, including mother's age as of September 1, 2002, whether both biological parents lived with child, whether biological mother was a recent immigrant, primary language spoken at home (English vs. Spanish/Other), household risk (low/no, medium, or high, as indexed by five risk factors including receipt of TANF or Food Stamps, neither parent having high school diploma or a GED, neither parent being employed or in school, the child's biological mother being a single parent, and mother giving birth to the child as a teenager), and urbanicity."}, {"section_title": "Analytic Strategy", "text": "The analyses were conducted by cohort in respective years from Head Start year (spring 2003) through first grade (spring 2006). To replicate the estimates in the HSIS reports, intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses were first conducted for overall comparisons between children who were randomly assigned to the HSIS treatment and control groups (USDHHS, 2005) . Treatment-on-treated (TOT) estimates for those who participated in Head Start were then calculated using the same approach used by the HSIS (USDHHS, 2010), achieved by dividing ITT estimates by (1 -n -c), where n is the rate of no-shows and c is the rate of crossovers. Following the procedures and strategies adopted by the analyses in the HSIS reports (USDHHS, 2005 (USDHHS, , 2010 (USDHHS, , 2012 , ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions were conducted for ITT estimates and then TOT estimates were calculated separately in 3-and 4-year-old cohorts by year of data collection. All models incorporated sampling weights and jackknife replicate weights provided in the HSIS data for each wave of the outcome measures, which were adjusted for nonresponse to represent the national population of newly entering Head Start participants for 2002 (USDHHS, 2010 (USDHHS, , 2012 .\nTo examine the effects of Head Start compared with the specific child care arrangements of children in the control group, OLS regressions were first conducted in subsamples containing children in the treatment group who participated in Head Start and children with a specific care arrangement in the control group. A principal score matching approach was then adopted to identify a group of Head Start participants in the HSIS treatment group who were similar to children with a specific care arrangement in the control group and who would have been most likely to have chosen this care arrangement if they had been assigned to the control group. As a derivative of propensity score matching, principal score matching builds on methodological innovations in principal stratification in the context of randomized experiments (Barnard, Frangakis, Hill, & Rubin, 2003; Frangakis & Rubin, 2002; Hill et al., 2002; Zhai et al., 2010) . Specifically, the principal score matching method was conducted in three stages in the 3-and 4-year-old cohorts separately. In the first stage, child and family covariates, as detailed above, were used to predict the probability of choosing different care arrangements (i.e., Head Start, other center-based care, relative/ nonrelative care, and parental care) for each child in the control group, using a multinomial logistic regression model. The predictive model also adjusted for both sampling weights and jackknife replicate weights for each wave of the outcome measures. The estimated parameters were then applied to the treatment group to estimate the probabilities of choosing these arrangements for Head Start participants if they had been assigned to the control group. These probabilities are referred to as principal scores because they are used to stratify the population into mutually exclusive subgroups (i.e., principal strata) based on theoretical pretreatment variables (Frangakis & Rubin, 2002; Hill et al., 2003) .\nIn the second stage, each child in the control group who received a specific child care arrangement was matched with Head Start participants in the treatment group who had the closest principal scores, using radius matching with a caliper at 0.01 (i.e., much smaller than 0.25 times a SD of the predicted principal scores, as suggested by Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1985) . Radius matching with a caliper allows for the use of all comparison units within the maximum distance of the caliper where best matches can be made (Dehejia & Wahba, 2002; Neidell & Waldfogel, 2009 ). In addition, a common support option was used in the matching to limit children with the specific child care arrangement to those whose principal scores had overlap with those of Head Start participants in the treatment group. The random assignment of the HSIS ensured that children in the treatment and control groups overall were similar at baseline, which made it possible to find \"matches\" in the treatment group for children in the control group who had specific child care arrangements (Hill et al., 2002 Zhai et al., 2010) . Balance tests were conducted to ensure that after matching the covariates of children in the matched samples were wellbalanced (Dehejia & Wahba, 2002) .\nIn the third stage, the effects of Head Start were estimated by the regression-adjusted differences in outcomes between children who received specific child care arrangements in the control group and matched Head Start participants in the treatment group. Regression adjustment after matching or random assignment takes into account the effects of covariates on outcomes rather than attributing children's differences in outcomes only to their participation in Head Start and thus can further reduce potential bias USDHHS, 2005 USDHHS, , 2010 USDHHS, , 2012 . OLS regressions were conducted including the same covariates as in the above ITT analyses, using sampling weights and jackknife replicate weights for each wave of the outcome measures multiplied, respectively, by the weights generated from the principal score matching process.\nTo test the robustness of the findings of OLS regressions without and with principal score matching, we further used an inverse probability weighting (IPW) approach. IPW aims to reweight children in the comparison groups to make them representative of the population of interest and can lead to an efficient estimate of the average treatment effect (Austin, 2011; Hirano, Imbens, & Ridder, 2003) . Compared with matching approaches, IPW may be more sensitive to model specifications and sometimes remove less imbalance between comparison groups (Austin, 2011; Rubin, 2004) . In addition, IPW may bias the estimated SEs downward and This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\nmay also have inaccurate or unstable weights for observations with quite high or low probabilities (Austin, 2011; Freedman & Berk, 2008) . Therefore, IPW may result in biased estimates of treatment effects.\nTo use IPW in the investigation of the treatment effects of Head Start contingent on a specific child care arrangement (i.e., what care arrangement children would receive in the absence of Head Start), the principal scores (i.e., P) estimated in the first stage above were used to calculate the weights for Head Start participants in the treatment group [P/(1 -P)] and assigned a weight of 1 for children in the control group who received the specific child care arrangement. Similar to the principal score matching, sampling and jackknife replicate weights for each wave of the outcome measures, multiplied, respectively, by the weights calculated in IPW, were then used in the OLS regressions to estimate the effects of Head Start compared with the specific child care arrangements in the control group.\nIn the analyses, a large number of individual statistical tests were conducted, which increased the probability that some findings might be statistically significant by chance. To address this issue of false discovery, a Benjamini-Hochberg (1995) test was conducted to limit the false discovery rate in the outcome measures used for a given age cohort in a given year to no more than 10%, following the procedure adopted in the analyses for the HSIS reports (USDHHS, 2010 (USDHHS, , 2012 . In this test, the original p values for the individual impact estimates were ranked from 1 to m, where m was the total number of effects estimated for the outcome measures in a given cohort and a given year. Each p value was then compared with a calculated value equal to the value of its rank position in the ordering multiplied by 0.05 and divided by m. If a particular estimate was smaller than this calculated value, it was declared to pass the Benjamini-Hochberg test for multiple comparisons with a 10% false discovery rate. Table 2 presents the distribution of child care arrangements in the full sample of analysis in the Head Start year of spring 2003 (n \u03ed 3,778) and by treatment status for the 3-and 4-year-old cohorts separately. Not surprisingly, the majority of children (over three quarters) in the Head Start assigned treatment group participated in Head Start (85% in the 3-year-old cohort and 78% in the 4-year-old cohort). In the control group, the most frequent child care arrangement was parental care (about 40% of children in both cohorts), followed by other center-based care (25% in the 3-yearold cohort and 37% in the 4-year-old cohort). In addition, a considerable proportion of children in the control group also managed to attend a Head Start program (16% in the 3-year-old cohort and 13% in the 4-year-old cohort). Table 3 shows the descriptive statistics of child and family covariates in the Head Start year of spring 2003 by the treatment status and types of child care arrangements for 3-and 4-year-old cohorts separately (adjusted by sampling weights and jackknife replicate weights). The mean differences between Head Start participants in the treatment group and children in the control group with different care arrangements were tested using regression models. The discussion below focuses on results that were statistically significant at p \u03fd .05."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Descriptive Statistics", "text": "As presented in Table 3 , because all children in the HSIS were eligible for Head Start, children who were randomly assigned to the treatment and control groups were similar, in contrast to the dramatic differences between Head Start and non-Head Start children usually found in observational studies (e.g., Lee et al., 2014; Lee et al., 1988; Zhai et al., 2011) . However, differences did emerge when comparing Head Start participants in the treatment group to children in the control group who attended specific types of care arrangements. For example, in the 3-year-old cohort, compared with Head Start participants in the treatment group, children in the control group who received parental care or relative/nonrelative care were less likely to have special needs and more likely to have younger mothers and live with both biological parents. In the 4-year-old cohort, compared with Head Start participants in the treatment group, children in the control group who had parental care tended to be Black and have low or no household risk. Relatively fewer differences were found between Head Start participants in the treatment group and children in the control group who attended Head Start or other center-based care.\nAppendix shows the descriptive results of covariates after principal score matching in spring 2003 as an example of balance tests, in which no statistically significant differences were detected.

The bold results in Table 4 suggest that the significant findings passed the Benjamini-Hochberg tests for multiple comparisons.

Strong evidence means that the estimated impact was significant at p \u03fd .05 and held up after adjusting for false discovery. Moderate evidence indicates that the estimated impact was significant at p \u03fd .05 but did not hold up after adjusting for false discovery. Suggestive evidence indicates that the estimated impact was marginally significant at p \u03fd .10 and may or may not hold up after adjusting for false discovery. Given the large number of results presented in Table 4 and other tables, the discussions below focus on results that met the strong or moderate evidence standard (results that provided only suggestive evidence are shown in the tables but not discussed). The ITT and TOT estimates reported in Table 5 were quite close, if not identical, to those presented in the HSIS report (USDHHS, 2010), with negligible differences existing possibly because of the exclusions of Puerto Rico data in the restricted-use data and children with missing data on child care arrangements. 4 In the comparisons of Head Start in the treatment group to the specific child care arrangements in the control group, overall, the results in Table 5 from IPW and PSM models were consistent in terms of statistical significance and magnitude in most models. Because the PSM models may better address the issue of selection into alternative child care arrangements, the discussions below focus on the results of these models. Table 4 indicate that the effects of Head Start varied substantially by comparison group and that the size of significant effects when doing the more targeted comparisons with specific care arrangements was consistently larger than the ITT estimates.

Similar to the findings on cognitive outcomes, the strongest results were from the comparisons of Head Start to parental care and relative/nonrelative care. Many of the significant effects of Head Start in both cohorts on parent-reported aggressive and hyperactive behavior compared with specific alternative care arrangements were not evident at all in the general ITT models.\nIn both the 3-and 4-year-old cohorts, when compared with parental care, Head Start had significant initial effects on the reduction of parent-reported Hyperactive Behavior (d \u03ed \u03ea0.35 in the 3-year-old cohort, strong evidence, and d \u03ed \u03ea0.19 in the 4-year-old cohort, moderate evidence) in spring of the Head Start year in 2003.

In addition, in the 3-year-old cohort, compared with parental care, Head Start was linked to reduced Aggressive Behavior through age 4 (d \u03ed \u03ea0.15, moderate evidence) and kindergarten (d \u03ed \u03ea0.19, strong evidence).\nCompared with relative/nonrelative care, strong evidence suggests that in the 3-year-old cohort Head Start showed significant initial effects on the reduction of Aggressive Behavior Similar to the findings on cognitive outcomes, we did not find strong evidence that Head Start had significant effects on parentreported behavioral outcomes compared with other center-based care or Head Start in the control group, except for the effects on Social Skills and Positive Approaches to Learning in kindergarten in the 3-year-old cohort (d \u03ed 0.34). In the 3-year-old cohort, compared with other center-based care, moderate evidence suggests that Head Start was associated with reduced Aggressive Behavior at age 4 (d \u03ed \u03ea0.25) and Hyperactive Behavior in kindergarten (d \u03ed \u03ea0.19)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We used data from the HSIS, the only large-scale randomized experiment in Head Start history, to examine a question the random assignment study could not address-whether and how the impact of Head Start varied contingent on the alternative child care arrangements to which it was compared. Using a principal score matching approach to address the issue of selection into child care arrangements in the control group, we found that the effects of Head Start varied substantially depending on the alternative care arrangement, with the strongest and most lasting effects evident when Head Start was compared with parental care or relative/ nonrelative care. By comparing Head Start children in the treatment group with matched comparisons in several types of alternative care arrangements, this approach to analysis helped uncover significant effects of Head Start that the general ITT findings did not demonstrate and provided a different and more nuanced takehome story than \"Head Start/preschool does not work.\"\nIt should be noted that principal score matching, like propensity score matching and regressions in general, assumes ignorability or selection on observables, but not unobservables. In other words, it relies on the assumption that all confounding covariates related to treatment status are observed (Dehejia & Wahba, 2002; Hill et al., 2003; Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1985) . If any important variables unrelated to the covariates that were included in the models are omitted, the estimates of Head Start effects could possibly be biased. For example, parents' educational expectation and motivation have been found positively associated with children's early academic and social-behavioral development (Fan & Chen, 2001; Galindo & Sheldon, 2012; Hong & Ho, 2005; Kim, Sheridan, Kwon, & Koziol, 2013) . These factors may also affect parents' care arrangements for their children and should be investigated in future research. Moreover, because of the relatively small sample sizes in the comparisons of some specific child care arrangements by cohort, the estimates of Head Start effects may not be precise and caution should be taken in interpreting and generalizing the findings. In addition, we used the focal child care arrangements defined in the HSIS reports to be consistent with the analyses in these reports; this variable also had minimal missing data. A considerable proportion of children in the sample had missing data on the time they spent in specific child care settings (e.g., 37% with missing data on the hours in the setting that they spent most of the time from Monday through Friday). Therefore, given the large number of models conducted, we did not further explore the effects of child care arrangements with various hours or multiple care arrangements, which may introduce some systematic bias into the data and remain as important topics to be investigated in the future.\nDespite these limitations, the findings in this study on how the effects of Head Start vary depending on the specific child care arrangements in the control group provide important information as to the children for whom the benefits of Head Start are likely to be greatest. In particular, the findings on the benefits of Head Start compared with parental care and relative/nonrelative care are important because the most common arrangement in the HSIS for eligible children whose parents applied for but did not get into Head Start was exclusive parental care (41% in the 3-year-old cohort and 38% in the 4-year-old cohort, as shown in Table 2 ), and together with children in relative/nonrelative care, they account for half or more of the children who were not granted access to Head Start (59% in the 3-year-old cohort and 50% in the 4-year-old cohort). These children, especially those in the 3-year-old cohort, may also benefit from Head Start through reductions of problem behaviors. Therefore, if the goal of Head Start is to improve children's school readiness in terms of cognitive and behavioral outcomes, an implication of this research is that policymakers should modify intake procedures for Head Start programs to ensure they reach disadvantaged children who otherwise would be likely to stay home with their parents or receive care from a relative or nonrelative. To do this, one approach would be to identify communities that have relatively large proportions of low-income families but do not currently have many preschool educational facilities. Where a large discrepancy exists, that would signal a need to develop and fund new centers (via possibly enhanced federal and state funding). In addition, within communities, it would also be possible to identify Head Start and other community centers that have the capacity to serve more children. Within Head Start programs, it might also be possible to implement better and more rapid recording of take-up, to track, for example, what proportion of children who are enrolled in the fall but leave the program during the year. These too are slots that could be filled. Once open slots are identified (within communities and within Head Start programs), outreach could be undertaken to find eligible families who are not being served, akin to barefoot doctors or public health initiatives to locate children and families in need of services, which have been often used in developing countries but sometimes in the United States as well (e.g., a review by Lehmann & Sanders, 2007 , for the World Health Organization; also see research and reviews by Bangdiwala et al., 2011; McCormick et al., 1989; Nxumalo, Goudge, & Thomas, 2013; Lee et al., 1988; van Ginneken, Lewin, & Berridge, 2010) .\nIn contrast, our results indicate that Head Start generally compared well to other center-based care. Overall, we found only a few differThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\nences between Head Start and other center-based care in the 3-yearold cohort and no differences in the 4-year-old cohort. This finding may not be surprising given the characteristics of the two types of programs based on data provided by the HSIS. On the one hand, Head Start in the HSIS treatment group had higher overall quality (with quality composite scores of 0.71 in the 3-year-old cohort and 0.74 in the 4-year-old cohort) 5 than other center-based care in the control group (with quality composite scores of 0.55 in the 3-year-old cohort and 0.57 in the 4-year-old cohort) and had more directors with a bachelor's degree (71% vs. 48% of directors in other center-based care in the 3-year-old cohort, but not in the 4-year-old cohort). On the other hand, other center-based care in the control group had more teachers with a bachelor's degree (50% in the 3-year-old cohort and 48% in the 4-year-old cohort) than Head Start in the treatment group (34% in the 3-year-old cohort and 32% in the 4-year-old cohort) and a lower turnover rate in the 3-year-old cohort (14% for new lead teachers vs. 18% in Head Start). Therefore, although other centerbased care may have overall lower quality than Head Start, children who attend other center-based care may be compensated by more teachers with a bachelor's degree and staying with same teachers. This raises the possibility that there is still much room to improve the quality of Head Start programs and children's experiences through measures such as increasing the rates of teachers with a bachelor's degree and reducing teachers' turnover rate. It should be noted that the definition and measures of early childhood education classroom quality have evolved significantly in recent years. There is now much more focus on process quality, especially the quality of teacher-child interactions, which has been found to be a strong predictor of children's sustainable gains in language, literacy, mathematics, and social skills (Burchinal, Vandergrift, Pianta, & Mashburn, 2010; Phillips & Lowenstein, 2011; Yoshikawa et al., 2013) . Because the element of process quality was not well represented in the HSIS measures, we could not compare the process quality between Head Start and other center-based care, which could be addressed in future research. Further analysis is also needed to look more closely at other outcomes that Head Start programs may address whereas other center-based programs may not (e.g., health, insurance coverage, and dental care).\nIn addition, we found almost no benefits of Head Start in social skills and approaches to learning (with one exception in kindergarten in the 3-year-old cohort). This finding is somewhat surprising, given Head Start's emphasis on the whole child. The approaches to learning skills are also one of the five essential domains (along with language and literacy, cognition and general knowledge, physical development and health, and social and emotional development) in the school readiness goals that all Head Start agencies are required to establish and take steps to achieve (USDHHS, 2011). One possible explanation may be the limitation of the parent-reported measure of social skills and approaches to learning used in our study, which may not provide a good estimate of the construct. Future research could use teacher-reported measures of social and learning skills in the HSIS data to investigate whether Head Start has significant effects on them. Moreover, we found that some effects of Head Start were not sustained after the Head Start year (e.g., on PPVT when compared with parental care and on WJ-III Applied Problems compared with relative/ nonrelative care in the 3-year-old cohort), whereas other effects that were sustained tended to go down over time. Further scientific inquiries are needed to better understand the follow-up contexts that children are exposed to after the Head Start year (e.g., a second year of Head Start for the 3-year-old cohort, and elementary school classrooms for both cohorts).\nIn conclusion, do the effects of Head Start vary depending on the alternative child care arrangements to which it is compared? The answer seems to be yes. Head Start clearly is most beneficial for children who, in the absence of the program, would have remained home with their parents or would have received informal care from a relative or nonrelative, and for these children at least some of the benefits of Head Start participation persist through first grade. Therefore, a clear policy implication of this study is to ensure that Head Start, and other center-based, programs reach more children who could benefit from them.
