[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "This study attempted to better understand the properties associated with the metabolic brain network in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Graph theory was employed to investigate the topological organization of metabolic brain network among 86 patients with MCI, 89 patients with AD, and 97 normal controls (NCs) using 18F fluorodeoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) data. The whole brain was divided into 82 areas by Brodmann atlas to construct networks.

Functional MRI (fMRI) could be employed to describe hemodynamic response related to neural activity. 4, 5 Liu et al 6 suggested that the nodal centrality was altered in medial temporal lobe (MTL) and occipital lobe during resting state fMRI scan, implying a rewiring in the brain network of MCI. A structural MRI study of MCI and AD explored the brain networks by measuring the gray matter volume, reporting altered correlations in the MTL and the abnormal hub regions in the frontal lobe. 7 Furthermore, the default mode network (DMN) deficits in amnestic MCI, such as a functional disruption in the alpha band and structural disconnection, were reported in a bimodal study that combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) with DTI. 8 In a DTI/FDG-PET study, patients with MCI and AD showed a reduced fractional anisotropy and white matter integrity within the limbic system, potentially causing MTL atrophy and posterior cingulate cortex hypometabolism. 9 Fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) could measure the metabolic patterns of the brain by examining the values of cerebral glucose metabolism. 10, 11 A longitudinal research suggested that 18F-FDG-PET was a valuable diagnostic tool for the prediction of clinical outcome in individual patients with MCI. 12 Using PET imaging, Caminiti et al investigated the alterations in connectivity indexes, brain modularity, and hubs configuration in 42 patients having dementia with Lewy bodies. 13 Toussaint et al combined the voxel-based analysis and independent component analysis to extract the characteristic metabolism patterns for discriminating stable MCI and converting MCI from AD with support vector machine classifier. 14 Recently, Zippo et al pointed out a new topological feature (compression flow) with random centrality-driven walks method to estimate the functional integration ability in the brain network among normal controls (NCs), patients with MCI, and patients with AD. 15 Furthermore, the disturbance in glucose metabolism might predict future cognitive decline. 16 The graph-theoretical analysis was introduced to analyze the brain networks, and it could provide a mathematical and conceptual framework to construct a whole network for exploring the topological patterns of brain networks. 17 Watts and Strogatz 18 had proposed that neural networks could be known as \"small-world\" networks with densely local connectivity between neighboring regions and sparsely long-range connectivity among distant regions. A previous study on the functional networks in MCI and AD indicated that functional integration in whole-brain network gradually declined with increasing severity of the illness. 19 Although most of the previous studies suggested disease-related alterations in topological patterns of AD/MCI, the findings were substantially inconsistent with different modalities (fMRI, 20 MEG, 21 and EEG 22 ). The large sample sizes and parametric investigation derived from PET imaging were essential to examine the MCI-and AD-related abnormalities in metabolic brain network at different scales. However, the characteristics of the metabolic brain networks of MCI and AD have not been explored extensively. 19, 23 In this study, we hypothesized that the metabolic networks of MCI and AD were characterized by abnormality in topological properties based on FDG-PET data. Metabolic networks were established by the average metabolism level of brain regions for MCI, AD, and NCs. We attempted to investigate the topological pattern, network robustness, and individual contribution using the network-based algorithm in MCI and AD. These findings in the metabolic network may provide critical insight into the brain pathophysiological mechanism in patients with MCI and AD."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Ethics Statement", "text": "Before the imaging collection, patients in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) provided written informed consent, which was approved by the institutional review boards at 59 performance sites.

In this study, Brodmann atlas (Supplementary Text 3) was applied to subdivide the cortex into 82 regions (ROI-based), which had been widely used as a reference for functional parcellation in brain imaging studies. 26 The metabolic correlations were statistical correlation coefficients between the average metabolic levels of discrete brain regions. Three steps were adopted to estimate the correlation matrices. First, we used the linear regression model to remove the effects of age, gender, and the average value of whole-brain metabolic level for each patient. Second, a correlation matrix R with dimensions 82 \u00c2 82 was generated, where every individual entry Rij was computed by the Pearson correlation coefficient between region i and j. 7 Finally, the correlation matrices were obtained with diagonal elements equivalent to 1 and the number of total probable correlations were 82 \u00c2 \u00f082 \u00c0 1\u00de=2 for each group.

The topology of each group network would differ significantly from each other under the thresholding of the same correlations value. In order to resolve this issue, sparsity (S) was used to threshold the correlations matrices of the networks into binarized matrices P, where an entry P ij equals 1 if |R ij | exceeded sparsity and 0 otherwise. 7 Sparsity was defined as the number of existing edges, K, divided by the maximum possible number of edges in a graph. 5 Definitive way for choosing a single optimal threshold value is yet absent. 28 Thus, a range of S values was utilized to threshold each correlations matrix repeatedly (18% S 40%). 28 This range of S values could provide a fully connected undirected graph, which provided a reasonable estimation of the properties of networks. In the current situations, a fixed sparsity (S \u00bc 18%) could guarantee that all regions were included in the networks, while minimizing the quantity of false-positive connections, thereby using it to threshold the metabolic networks of each group. 29 "}, {"section_title": "Small-World Properties Analysis", "text": "Small worldness is a ubiquitous property of complex brain networks. 30 The clustering coefficient (C p ) and the characteristic path length (L p ) of a network are used as the indices to describe the small world properties (Supplementary Text 4) .\nCriteria for the small-world characteristics aree as follows:\nindicates the C p and the L p of the matched random networks, 7 respectively, and the number of nodes, edges, and degrees distribution of these random networks were in line with the real network. 18 "}, {"section_title": "Nodal Centrality", "text": "The \"betweenness centrality\" was defined as a local characteristic for exploring the outstanding nodes in the metabolic networks (Supplementary Text 4). A node, which had a high betweenness might bridge different parts of the network. 31 A node with 2-fold higher than the average betweenness of the network would be defined as a hub region in our study. The betweenness value of each node was computed at a fixed sparsity 18% to ensure that the metabolic brain network was fully connected without fragmentation in each group. The hub nodes played a crucial role in facilitating information communication and processing among the human brain networks. 32 The arithmetic description of these characteristics is provided in the supporting information."}, {"section_title": "Network Robustness Analysis", "text": "Network robustness referring to the network stability and plasticity in the case of losing nodes or edges was a crucial parameter of a complex network. 33 In the metabolic brain networks, the network robustness could be evaluated by removing the nodes or edges in random and targeted patterns at the sparsity of 18%.\nIn the \"random pattern analysis,\" the basic design principle was removing nodes in the random order. The same operation was performed on the edges in the network. In the \"targeted pattern analysis,\" we first computed the betweenness value of each node and edge in the metabolic brain network for the 3 groups, respectively. Next, the nodes were deleted in decreasing sequence of their betweenness value. The same operation was performed on the edges. The size of the remainder component was a critical measurement of the ability to resist crashes. 34 \nAs seen in Figure 7 , in all the 3 groups, the sizes of the largest component decreased as the deletion ratio grew. The sizes of the largest component in patients with MCI and AD were smaller than that of the NC over a wide percentage of removal. We also noted that the performance of the 3 groups was interwoven near the end of the removal processes in both patterns ( Figure 7) . Responding to the failures and crashes, the metabolic brain network in patients with MCI and AD were more vulnerable than the NCs.\nIn this study, we established the largest cluster as a measure of quantifying network robustness. By deleting the nodes or edges in the metabolic brain network and computing the largest cluster, our approach enabled the quantitative inquiry of network robustness. We observed that metabolic brain network in MCI and AD were more vulnerable to perturbations or attacks compared to NC, and the performance of MCI was located between NC and AD, which provided the additional evidence that MCI was an intermediate stage from NC to AD (Figure 7) . Because of the power-law distribution, brain networks of the 3 groups were almost constant when deletion ratio was low. 61 After deletion ratio reached 50%, the performance of the 3 groups were amalgamated, thereby suggesting that the topological structure of the brain networks was extremely destroyed and thus unable to support integrality. From the network system perspective, the impact of losing nodes or edges could indicate a decline in cognition and memory in MCI and AD. Supporting evidence from He et al demonstrated that structural brain network of patients with AD showed vulnerability against perturbations compared to NC. 28 The reduced attack survivability might reflect the topological reorganization of the metabolic brain network, providing implications for cognition and memory impairment in MCI and AD. 28, 33 Correlations Between Individual Contribution and Clinical Assessment\nThe leave-one-out approach has been widely employed in classification accuracy validation and brain network research with regard to the mental illnesses with cognitive and behavioral deficits. Given that the individual contribution reflected an optimal balance between an individual and a group, it could be treated as an innovative measurement of brain network in neurological disease. 35 We detected that the individual contributions toward the group-level network were negatively associated with MMSE scores ( Figure 9A ) and positively correlated with CDR scores ( Figure 9B ). This suggested that participants with higher contributions have poor network topology because of their poor mental status and dementia severity. In congruence with previous studies, our findings provided additional evidence that higher individual contributions in the global metabolic network were related to severe cognitive impairment. 35 Patients with AD were characterized by various deteriorations in language, memory, praxis, and general intellectual status. 62 These clinical differences in AD might be caused by functional and structural alterations in the entire brain networks, leading to the highest contribution toward global metabolic network. 28 In addition, the general linear model between individual contribution and MMSE or CDR might be valuable to predict cognition status, which suggested the individual contribution might be considered as a biomarker in the diagnosis of MCI and AD."}, {"section_title": "Estimation of Individual Contribution by Leave-One-Out Approach", "text": "Previous graph-theoretical studies have uncovered abnormalities in structural and functional brain network on the group level or individual level. Using the leave-one-out (LOO) approach, we adequately considered the effects of both individual contribution and group-level properties. The individual contribution was estimated by removing 1 individual and reshaping the group-level brain network. Then, we combined the information regarding the individual cognitive impairment with the group-level brain parameters. The individual contribution was considered as a proxy of individual contributions from homologous group, 35 thereby providing preliminary evidence for the diversity of clinical symptoms (excessive jealousy, delusions of infidelity, and emotional distress) of patients with MCI and AD. 36 The correlation between clinical scores and individual contributions was introduced to identify the accuracy of the individual contribution in tracking the progression of the cognitive impairment or dementia in MCI and AD. We assumed that patients with higher differences have worse network organization patterns, which were specifically related to impairments in fundamental circuits for information integration. 35 Here, the participant Rx was removed to measure his or her individual contribution to the overall organization of the network. The Mantel's test statistic (Supplementary Text 5) was used to evaluate the similarity between the original and specific elements-removed metabolic brain networks. 37 To estimate the individual contribution Rx to global metabolism correlation matrix P, we used the Saggar estimation formula: 35 Loo Rx \u00bc 1 \u00c0 Mantel test\u00f0P i\u00bc1 ... :n ; P i\u00bc1 ... :x;x\u00fe1 ... :n \u00de: \u00f03\u00de\nIn order to investigated the relationships between LooRx and clinical assessments, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficients between LooRx and MMSE scores (as a measure of mental status) as well as between LooRx and CDR scores (as a measure of dementia severity), respectively."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "In our test, we would rearrange the PET data from 3 groups and then we get a reference distribution about the possible values of the test statistic. 7 To estimate the between-group significant differences in age, gender, MMSE, and CDR, analysis of variance with post hoc test was used in this study. First, we would compute the C p s and L p s in each real metabolic network over a wide range of network sparsity thresholds. For testing the significant between-group difference, we randomly intermix 1 group data with the 2 other groups separately. Second, we would divide the data into 2 groups in line with the numbers of the original groups. We took the same sparsity threshold to obtain the correlation coefficient matrices so as to compute the C p s and L p s. Then, we did the repetitive experiment for 1000 times. At last, we sorted the 1000 results and found the between-group differences in real networks. If between-group differences were included in 95% (2-tailed) of the supposed between-group differences, we would accept the null hypothesis of the same probability between the 2 groups at the 5% level. If not, we rejected the null hypothesis.\n38 Figure 1 . Metabolism-based connectivity matrices for normal control (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD).

In this study, the highest C p and the longest L p were observed in AD, while MCI showed the intermediate values between normal aging and AD. Our findings provided additional evidence that MCI could be considered as the prodromal stage of AD. The longer L p led to the lower level of the global efficiency in MCI and AD. 46 A lower speed of information processing and dissemination caused by low global efficiency might indicate poor manifestation in cognitive responses of Figure 6 . Brain regions showed abnormal nodal centrality in whole brain networks.

Moreover, the high C p in patients indicated that the networks might self-rewire to improve the local efficiency as the compensation system for maintaining the brain organization. 48 In addition, the 3 groups presented no significant differences in L p (P < .05), which indicated the differences in global integrated information processing failed to pass the statistical level. 7 Abnormal Changes in Nodal Centrality (Hub) in MCI and AD\nThe hub regions in the metabolic networks included 13 regions in NC, 11 in MCI, and 7 in AD (Table 2; Figure 5 ). The hub regions in MCI and AD altered in number and spatial distribution, which might increase the risk of losing the plastic ability of the brain. 49 The left BA4 (primary motor cortex), BA8, and right BA48 showed a high nodal centrality as common hubs in NC and MCI, implying stabilized state in the motor function and limited memory impairment during the MCI process. 50, 51 Combining FDG-PET with fMRI, Perrotin et al suggested that hypometabolism in BA11 correlated with anosognosia in patients with AD. 52 In our study, the common hub region in MCI and AD groups might indicate a compensatory nature for mediating memory processes. 53 Figure 6 showed the higher nodal centrality in brain regions including BA26, BA45, and BA47 in MCI and BA20 and BA40 in AD when compared to NC. Mild cognitive impairment had been associated not only with structural but also with functional aberrations, such as metabolism enhanced in BA26, 54 and significant activation in BA45 during the phonological processing. 55 Moreover, evidence from a face-matching task showed an increased functional connectivity related to BA20 in MCI. 56 Previous research indicated that the temporal pole underwent serious structural changes involving cortical atrophy and synaptic loss in AD. 57 Furthermore, BA40 possessed a higher proportion of fibers in patients with AD. 58 Thus, the increased nodal centrality in Figure 6 might be the compensation responses in MCI and AD. 27 On the other hand, the nodal centrality regions in MCI and AD were also found to be significantly decreased (Figure 6 ), predominately located in BA7, BA8, and BA25. The prior structural network study using MRI reported that the gray matter volume of BA25 was highly atrophied in the MCI and AD. 59 A review of neuroimaging in AD suggested that hypometabolism or hypoperfusion occurred in the cingulate cortex and precuneus. 60 In the present study, the lower nodal centrality likely reflected the breakdown of metabolism system which might impede cognitive functioning in MCI and AD."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In this study, we combined the robustness analysis and LOO approach to investigate the organization of metabolic networks in patients with MCI and AD based on the FDG-PET data. Both MCI and AD showed a loss of small-world properties and abnormal organization of the metabolic networks, which were explored by local and global characteristics, that is, increased C p and L p , and altered nodal centrality. Additionally, the brain networks in MCI and AD were vulnerable to random or sequential targeted attacks compared to NC. Finally, individual contribution significantly correlated with neuropsychological scores.
