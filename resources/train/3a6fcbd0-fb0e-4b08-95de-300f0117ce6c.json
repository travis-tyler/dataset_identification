Introduction", "text": "Maternal employment has been the norm in the US since the 1980's. When mothers reallocate their time from home to market work, however, this shift potentially affects not just the health and wellbeing of children but also the health and well-being of the parents and the family as a whole (Bianchi 2000; Riggio, 2006) . In the economics literature, previous research on the effects of maternal employment has focused on a narrow set of child outcomes -scores on cognitive tests and a single behavioral assessment, the Behavior Problems Index (BPI). However, because only child outcomes and not maternal or family outcomes are examined, we obtain an incomplete picture of the effects of maternal employment from these studies. To develop public policies that meet the needs of a society in which most mothers are employed, we need a broader knowledge base regarding how maternal employment affects families.\nThis study uses longitudinal data from Phases I and II of the NICHD Study on Early\nChild Care (SECC) to examine the effects of maternal employment on family well-being, measured by maternal mental and overall health, parenting stress, and parenting quality. First, we estimate the effects of maternal employment on these outcomes measured when children are 6 months old, a point at which child-rearing is particularly time-intensive and maternal employment may have its most important effects. Next, we take advantage of the longitudinal aspect of the SECC and use dynamic panel data models to examine the effects of maternal employment on family outcomes during the first 4.5 years of children's lives. Notably, these models account for both unobserved heterogeneity as well as state dependence in the maternal health and parenting outcomes. The primary contributions of this paper are: (1) we examine the effects of maternal employment on a broader set of family outcomes than most US-based studies have considered, including parenting quality assessed in a laboratory setting; (2) in addition to work hours, we consider effects of work characteristics such as job flexibility; (3) we draw on longitudinal data to gauge whether effects persist over early childhood; and (4) we use empirical methods that address the potential endogeneity of maternal work hours, as well as the dynamic nature of the relationship between maternal employment and family outcomes.\nOur findings indicate that maternal employment is associated with reductions in family wellbeing when children are 6 months old. Among mothers of six month old infants, maternal work hours are positively associated with depressive symptoms and self-reported parenting stress, and negatively associated with self-rated overall health among mothers. Compared to mothers who are on leave 3 months after childbirth, mothers who are working full-time score 22 percent higher on the CES-D scale of depressive symptoms. However, maternal employment is not associated with the quality of parenting at 6 months, based on trained assessors' observations of maternal sensitivity.

Effects of early maternal employment on family outcomes", "text": "There is an extensive theoretical and empirical literature outside of economics that highlights the importance of the family environment, parenting, and maternal health in shaping interactive with and less responsive to their children (Campbell et al. 1995) , and are less likely to seek appropriate health care for their children (Minkovitz et al., 2005) . Compared to infants of healthy mothers, infants of depressed mothers are more negative and less playful (Cohn et al., 1986; Field, 1984) , have more behavior problems during childhood (Field 1984 These effects of maternal employment on children vary by the characteristics of children (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, and gender of child) and families (e.g., SES), and also by child care quality (e.g., type of child care arrangement). The negative effects of maternal employment tend to be stronger for children from more advantaged, majority-race backgrounds (Ruhm, 2008; Berger et al., 2008; Gregg et al., 2005) . Moreover, non-standard maternal work schedules during the child's first few years are associated with child behavior problems (Daniel et al., 2009; Han, 2005) , and recent research based on the SECC shows that more hours of non-relative child care\nare associated with child behavior problems up to age 15 (Vandell et al., 2010) .\nA few recent studies focus on the effect of one aspect of maternal employment -the length of maternity leave -on maternal health, which is one of the measures of family wellbeing we consider in the present study. These studies offer mixed evidence that maternity leave is associated with maternal health. Based on Canadian data, Baker and Milligan (2008) evaluate a mandated increase in the number of weeks of maternity leave granted to new parents. They find that increasing paid leave benefits from a maximum of 25 weeks to 50 weeks has no influence on maternal health measured by self reported health status, a depression scale, an indicator of post partum depression and a count of post-partum physical problems. In the US context, Chatterji & Markowitz (2005 , 2008 use data from the 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health Survey (NMIHS) and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study -Birth Cohort (ECLS-B) to examine the association between maternity leave length and maternal health. The findings from these two papers suggest that longer maternity leave (paid and un-paid) is associated with lower levels of maternal depressive symptoms, a lower likelihood of the mother having frequent outpatient visits during the first six months after childbirth, and better self-reported overall health among mothers.\nTo our knowledge, only one recent study in economics has focused on the effects of maternal employment on the wellbeing of the family. Baker, Gruber & Milligan (2008) take advantage of a natural experiment in which one Canadian province (Quebec) introduced a comprehensive, highly subsidized child care system. This policy change led to a rise in child care usage, an increase in maternal employment, and an increase in children's adverse health and developmental outcomes in Quebec relative to the rest of Canada. These negative effects on children are consistent with the US-based literature on the effects of maternal employment on child outcomes. Baker, Gruber & Milligan, however, also examine family outcomes which have not been studied in the US context. These authors find that the policy change was associated with less effective parenting, less satisfaction with marital relationships, increases in maternal depressive symptoms, and decline in the overall self-assessed health of fathers (but not mothers).\nThis study is notable in that the authors examine a range of family indicators of wellbeing, not just children's outcomes, and all effects suggest detrimental effects of child care and maternal employment on families.\nWe build on this recent paper by examining these types of effects in the US context where, compared to Canada and other industrialized countries, mothers return to work early and at best have limited access to paid leave and affordable, high quality child care. This paper contributes to the growing economics literature on the effects of maternal employment in three respects. First, it expands the range of outcomes considered by examining the effects of maternal employment on several measures of family wellbeing that are critical to young children's development --maternal mental health, maternal overall health, parenting stress, and the quality of parenting.\nSecond, we use data from the SECC, the only national, longitudinal data set available that includes detailed information on maternal work hours as well as state-of-the-art measurement of family outcomes, including laboratory assessments of parenting behaviors. Using the SECC, we attempt to address the possibility that unmeasured factors confound an observed association between maternal employment and family outcomes by estimating models that include an unusually extensive set of controls, including measures of initial family wellbeing and maternal ability, and by estimating dynamic panel models which address unobserved heterogeneity as well as state dependence in the outcomes.\nThird, we build on prior work by examining not only the effects of maternal work hours on family wellbeing, but also the effects of the characteristics of her work -specifically, whether the mother does some work at home, whether she has flexible hours, whether she travels overnight for work, and whether she works non-standard hours. By examining these characteristics in addition to hours of work, we gain a richer and more nuanced picture of how maternal employment affects families."}, {"section_title": "III. The NICHD Study of Early Child Care (SECC)", "text": "The SECC is a longitudinal study designed to examine the relationship between child care and children's development. In 1991, the SECC enrolled 1,364 healthy infants with English-speaking, adult mothers from ten sites across the United States. The sample average CES-D score at the 6-month interview is 8.9, and 17 percent of the sample is depressed at the time of the 6-month interview (Table 1) . It is notable that mothers who are employed at 6 months have appreciably lower CES-D scores and rates of depression at both the 1 month and 6 month interviews compared to mothers who are not employed at 6 months ( Table 2 ). The rate of depression among full-time employed mothers at 6 months is 15 percent versus 22 percent among mothers who were not employed at 6 months ( Table 2 ).\nOverall health: Every three months, SECC mothers rated their own health in the past 3 months, compared to other women their age. Mothers can report their health as poor (1), fair (2), good (3) or excellent (4). We combine the poor and fair rankings since the number of mothers reporting poor health was small. We use this rating as an outcome measure, as well as a dichotomous indicator that equals one if the mother reports her health in general is fair or poor.\nSince the question does not specify physical or emotional health, these variables may capture both physical and mental illness.\nMothers reported on their health through home and telephone interviews every 3-4 months from the 1 month until the 54 month interview. At the 6-month interview, 12 percent of mothers report poor or fair health (Table 1) . Employed mothers at 6 months have much lower rates of poor/fair health at the 1 month and at the 6 month interviews compared to mothers who\nare not employed at 6 months -for example, 9 percent of full-time employed mothers report poor or fair health at 6 months compared to 18 percent of mothers who are not employed at 6 months ( Table 2 ).\nParenting Stress: To measure parenting stress, we draw on two scales completed by SECC mothers during the home interviews. At the 1 month and 6 month interviews, mothers completed a 30-item version of the Abidin Parenting Stress Index, which is designed to measure parent-child relationship stress and risk for adverse parenting and child behavioral outcomes.\nThe index includes items such as \"I feel trapped by my responsibilities as a parent\", \"I enjoy being a parent\" and \"I feel capable and on top of things when caring for my baby.\" At the 15, 24\nand 36-month interviews, mothers were administered a 20 item adapted form of the Parent Role Quality Scale, which is appropriate to measure parenting stress among parents of toddlers and pre-school age children. Mothers are presented with ten potential concerns and ten potential rewards of child-rearing, and are asked to rate how much these concerns and rewards reflect their own experiences in parenting. The scale includes concerns such as \"feeling tied down because of the children\" and \"the unending responsibilities\" and rewards such as \"the love your child\nshows\" and \"seeing your child grow and change.\" For both measures of parenting stress, higher scores indicate a greater degree of parenting stress. Table 2 shows that employed mothers at 6 months report lower rates of parenting stress than mothers who were not employed at 6 months. This is true of parenting stress measured at the 1 month interview as well.\nMaternal Sensitivity: Maternal sensitivity is measured using trained observers' ratings of videotapes of mothers' behavior toward their children in semi-structured play situations. At 6 and 15 months, mother/child interactions were observed in the child's home, while at 24, 36, and 54 months these observations were conducted in the laboratory. These interactions are designed to demonstrate the degree to which the mother responds in a sensitive way to the child's nondistress, intrusiveness (reverse scored), and positive regard (at the 6, 15, and 25 month assessments), and the mother's supportive presence, hostility (reverse scored) and respect for autonomy (at 36 and 54 months). Higher scores indicate higher degree of sensitivity to the child. Table 2 shows that although employed mothers report better mental and overall health and lower parenting stress than mothers who are not employed at 6 months, full-time employed mothers are not different from mothers who are not working at 6 months in maternal sensitivity. Part-time working mothers have slightly higher sensitivity ratings compared to mothers who are not working at 6 months."}, {"section_title": "b. Maternal employment", "text": "Mothers provided employment information during each home interview (1, 6, 15, 24, 36 and 54 months) and most this information was updated during intervening telephone contacts every 3 to 4 months. For each of these potentially 16 time points, we created several measures of lagged maternal employment. As described in the next section, we use lagged measures to avoid problems with reverse causality. The measures are: (1) the number of hours worked per week measured at the home or telephone interview that was conducted 3 months prior (hours worked at last interview); (2) the average of weekly hours prior two assessments conducted 3 and 6 months ago (average hours worked over past 2 waves); and (3) the average weekly hours the mother worked up to and including the most recent prior assessment point (average hours worked in child's life). Based on these continuous measures of work hours, we also created three dummy indicators for: (1) worked 1 to 20 hours per week at last interview; (2) worked 21\nto 39 hours per week at last interview; and (3) worked at least 40 hours per week at last interview. When we estimate models using the full sample, the baseline category combines mothers who are not employed with mothers who are employed but are on leave at 3 months.\nWhen we estimate models using a sample limited to employed mothers (defined as mothers who report that they are employed and working or employed and on leave at the 1 month interview), the baseline category is limited to mothers who are employed but are still on leave at the 3 month interview.\nIn addition to work hours, employed SECC mothers provided information regarding the characteristics of their jobs. In all home and telephone interviews from 3 to 54 months, mothers were asked the number of hours they could work at home, and the time of day of their work hours (daytime, evening, night or varying shifts). From this information, we created a dummy variable indicating the mother could work at least 10 hours a week from home, and a dummy variable indicating the mother worked a non-daytime shift. During the 6, 15, 24 and 36 month interviews, mothers also reported whether their job required overnight travel (never, less than once a month, more than once a month) and whether their work hours were not at all flexible, a little flexible (can leave in an emergency), fairly flexible, and completely flexible. From this information, we created dummy variables indicating whether the mother's job requires any overnight travel (either less than once a month or more than once a month) and whether the mother's job is either fairly or completely flexible. When work characteristics are of interest, we limit the sample to employed mothers.\nAt the 6-month interview, 64 percent of mothers were employed or on leave, and the average weekly hours among employed mothers was about 33 (Table 1) . Among employed mothers at the 6-month interview, 64 percent reported flexible hours, 22 percent worked alternate shifts, 18 percent had overnight travel, and 12 percent worked from home at least 10 hours per week (Table 1) ."}, {"section_title": "c. Other covariates", "text": "To adjust for other factors that may confound an association between maternal employment and family outcomes, we estimate models that include extensive sets of controls for family socio-economic status, the mother's education and ability, the mother's attitudes towards employment, and the initial health endowment of the child. All models include the following Some models also include the following measures: dummy indicators for mother's occupation in the year prior to childbirth, 3 family income in the year prior to childbirth, current family income, mother's score on scale measuring progressivity of child-rearing beliefs measured at 1-month interview, mother's score on scale measuring work commitment administered at 1-month interview, mother's score on scale measuring benefits of maternal employment administered at 1-month interview, dummy indicators for family structure at 1-month (single parent/other family structure, live-in partner with married as the baseline, dummy indicator for child's father does not live in HH), and dummy indicators for whether the child spends at least 10 hours a week in six types of child care arrangements (daycare center, child care home, father, grandparent, in-home caregiver, multiple arrangements). 4 "}, {"section_title": "IV. Empirical Approach", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. Effects of maternal employment on 6-month family outcomes", "text": "We begin by estimating Eq. 1 using outcomes measured when children are 6 months old (t=6 in Equation 1).\n(\nIn equation 1, y i6 represents the ith family's health or parenting outcome at the 6-month interview, X is a vector of covariates, W is a vector of lagged measures of maternal employment measured at the 3-month interview, \u03bd represents unmeasured family/maternal characteristics that affect y, \u03b5 is a random error term, and \u03b1 and \u03b2 are parameters to be estimated. As discussed below, lagged employment is used to help reduce the possibility of bias resulting from reverse causality. For continuous outcomes (e.g., depressive symptoms, parenting quality, parenting stress), we use OLS for estimation of Equation 1, while we use standard probit models for binary outcomes (e.g. poor/fair health, depressed) and an ordered probit model for self-assessed health rating (e.g., 1 = fair/poor health, 2 = good health, 3 = excellent health). We estimate HuberWhite standard errors adjusted for clustering on site.\nThe causal effect of maternal employment on family wellbeing, \u03b2, may be positive or On the other hand, maternal employment brings more income that can be used to purchase market goods that benefit the family and the mothers themselves. On the other hand, if mothers select into employment along unmeasured characteristics that detract from family outcomes, the estimate of \u03b2 would be biased downwards. For example, if mothers experiencing difficult adjustment to parenthood are more likely to return to work and more likely to have adverse outcomes, \u03b2 will capture both the effects of employment and this poor adjustment effect. In our sample, employed mothers at 6 months tend to be healthier at baseline and generally more advantaged than non-employed mothers (Table 2) . This fact suggests, but does not definitively imply, that employed mothers also may have unobserved characteristics that pre-dispose them to favorable family outcomes compared to non-employed mothers (Altonji et al., 2005) .\nIn order to reduce the possibility of bias from unmeasured factors, we estimate models with unusually rich and extensive sets of control variables. We begin with a specification that includes only pre-determined variables -maternal age, maternal race/ethnicity, total household size, maternal education, maternal reading test score (a proxy for ability), pregnancy complications, mother smoked during pregnancy, low birth weight child, premature child, child gender, birth order of child, birth month of child, site fixed effects, and lagged maternal health and parenting (measured by maternal depression, maternal overall health and maternal parenting stress at the 1-month interview). Notably, our baseline model adjusts extensively for the family's initial state of health and wellbeing, as well as for maternal ability, which are perhaps the two most likely confounding factors. 6 Next, we estimate richer specifications to gauge the degree of selection along observed characteristics of the family. We incrementally add controls for (1) maternal occupation prior to the child's birth and family income prior to the child's birth; and (2) family structure, maternal beliefs about the benefits of employment, work commitment, and beliefs about child-rearing measured when the child was 1 month old. 7 We also re-estimate all of these models after limiting the sample to mothers who are employed (either working or on leave) at the 1 month interview. Limiting the sample this way may further reduce unobserved heterogeneity, although it comes at the cost of a reduction in power.\nIn addition to unobserved heterogeneity, a second potential problem that arises in estimating \u03b2 is reverse causality. Although we seek to estimate the effect of maternal In particular, in our main specifications, we do not include current family income or current child care arrangements as right hand side variables since these factors may be critical mechanisms through which maternal employment affects family outcomes. In alternative specifications, however, we do include these variables in order to gauge how much of the effect of employment on family outcomes is operating through income and child care arrangements.\nIncome is likely to be the primary route (although probably is not the only route) through which maternal employment improves family outcomes; including a control for family income thus may exacerbate any negative effects of maternal employment that may exist. In the case of child care, one possibility is that the use of child care improves family outcomes, if child care is a positive experience for children and their parents -in this case, including controls for child care\nwould, like income, worsen any negative effects of maternal employment that may exist. If child care causes stress and difficulties for children and parents, however, including controls for child care may actually reduce any estimated negative effects of maternal employment on outcomes.\nA fourth empirical issue is the possibility that the effect of maternal employment varies by family characteristics. Following the literature on maternal employment and children, we estimate models on the following sub-samples: mothers who are living in poverty at baseline vs.\nmothers who are not; mothers with less than 16 years of education vs. college educated mothers; mothers living in poverty at baseline vs. mothers not living in poverty at baseline; and married vs. unmarried mothers. Since the SECC did not over-sample disadvantaged or minority populations, our samples sizes are small for some of these analyses, and we cannot examine effects for racial/ethnic sub-samples."}, {"section_title": "B. Effects of maternal employment on family outcomes during the first 4.5 years of life", "text": "Next, we move to examining whether the effects of maternal employment on family outcomes persist during early childhood. To do so, we use pooled data from Phases I and II of the SECC, which include information collected when the children were 1 month to 54 months old. Here, we examine effects of lagged maternal work hours only, and do not consider other work characteristics, due to data availability.\nWe estimate dynamic panel data models which account for individual fixed effects, as well as the strong degree of persistence in maternal health and parenting outcomes during the first 4.5 years of children's lives. This persistence may be due to true state dependence (e.g., stock of maternal health and parenting capital evolves slowly over time) and/or to unmeasured factors (e.g. genetics) (Contoyannis, 2004) . To account for this persistence, our models include a lagged dependent variable on the right hand side, as seen below in Equation (1'). In equation 1', y it represents the ith family's health/parenting outcomes at time t, y it-1 is a lagged dependent variable measured 3 months prior to t, X is a vector of time-varying covariates, W is a lagged measure of maternal employment measured 3 months prior to t, \u03bd represents unmeasured family/maternal characteristics that affect y, \u03b5 is a random error term, and \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b4 are parameters to be estimated.\n(1') y it = y it-1 \u03b4 + X it \u03b1 + W it-1 \u03b2 + \u03bd i + \u03b5 it\nIn the case of the maternal overall health outcome, we draw on unusually rich data.\nMaternal overall health, maternal employment information and some critical time-varying factors (household size, whether the father lives in the household) are reported by mothers about every 3 months from the 1 month to the 54 month interviews. We emphasize that the frequency of the data collection for this outcome reduces the likelihood of confounding by unmeasured time-varying factors, but increases the likely degree of state dependence in the maternal health outcome. For other outcomes (depression, parenting stress, quality of parenting), we draw on data that is available at the 1, 15, 24, 36, and 54 month interviews. Confounding by time-varying unmeasured factors is of greater concern in these models.\nTo estimate Eq. 1', we use Arellano-Bond (A-B) difference GMM methods (Arellano & Bond, 1991) . These methods are well-suited for our case in which we have: (1) individual fixed effects; (2) a lagged dependent variable on the right hand side; and (3) a large N and a small t.\nA-B methods address the problem that lagged health/parenting (on the right hand side of Eq. 1') is correlated with the error term once the equation is first-differenced to remove the individual fixed effect. The A-B approach involves instrumenting for the difference between lagged and current health/parenting using deeper lagged measures of health/parenting. In our application, we also need to instrument for lagged work hours, which are predetermined in Equation 1' but become endogenous to the model when we take the first difference. We use the one-step version of the A-B estimator which generates robust standard errors, and we report results from tests for first and second order autocorrelation, and from Hansen's J test of overidentification."}, {"section_title": "V. Results", "text": "We begin the formal analysis with an examination of the effects of maternal work hours measured at the 3 month interview on the five different maternal mental health and parenting outcomes measured when the child is six months old. Table 3a shows results for the full sample, where mothers who are employed but are on leave at 3 months have zero work hours and thus are combined in the baseline category with mothers who are not employed. Table 3b shows results for the employed sample, where mothers with zero work hours at 3 months are all employed but on leave from their jobs. In both tables, the dependent variables are listed in the rows. Column 1 shows estimates from the most parsimonious specification. The models in the columns labeled 2 through 6 incrementally add covariates as indicated in the bottom rows of the table. For continuous outcomes, we show estimated coefficients and T-statistics from OLS models, and for dichotomous outcomes, we show average marginal effects and T-statistics from probit models.\nThe first row of estimates in Tables 3a and 3b hours is associated with an increase in the depression score in the range of 3 to 7 percent among the full sample, and a similar range of 6 to 9 percent for the employed sample. These are relatively small effects, given that a 10 hour increase corresponds to about a 40 percent increase in work hours among employed mothers (lagged work hours among employed mothers at the 6 month interview was about 25 hours per week).\nMoreover, increases in work hours do not move mothers over the indicator threshold for depression unless current child care arrangements are included as covariates and the full sample is used for estimation (Tables 3a and 3b ). Columns 5 and 6 in Table 3a show that after the indirect effect of child care arrangements is netted out of the total effect, increased work hours have a detrimental effect on maternal mental health, as indicated by an increased probability of being over the CES-D threshold score of 16. The magnitude of this effect implies that a ten hour increase in work hours on average increases the likelihood of depression by .02 in the both samples, which is about a 12 percent increase at the sample mean for depression of 17% in the full sample (Columns 5 and 6, Table 3a ).\nBut what this finding also indicates is that that at least some forms of child care have a protective effect on maternal mental health -adjusting for other factors, the results show that using center-based child care and having a grandparent care for the child, relative to care by the mother, both are associated with reductions in depressive symptoms at the 6 month interview (results not shown). However, as we argue above, the effect we are most interested in is the total effect of work hours on the outcomes, not the effect of working net of the mechanisms. The models that exclude child care represent the total effect of hours on the depression indicator, which includes the direct effect of working on health, as well as the indirect effects of child care arrangements and income (which is determined by work hours) on health.\nFor the full sample, Table 3a shows that overall health, parenting stress, and parenting quality are all unaffected (statistically) by increases in maternal work hours. These insignificant results persist regardless of the other included variables. However, these results likely reflect the averages of two groups of women, those who work and those who do not. Among employed mothers, in fact, we find that hours worked is positively associated with self-reported parenting stress at 6 months (Table 3b ). However, this stress apparently does not translate into poorer parenting based on objective measurements, as increased work hours are not statistically associated with the parenting quality (maternal sensitivity) score at 6 months (Tables 3a-b) .\nWe also estimated the models shown in Tables 3a-b using sub-samples of mothers who were college educated, not college educated, married at the 1 mo. interview, not married at the 1 mo. interview, living in poverty at the 1 mo. interview and not living in poverty at the 1 mo.\ninterview (results not shown). Some of these samples are small, but the general pattern of findings suggests that the negative effects of work hours on depression and parenting stress are driven by effects among married mothers, and they hold for both college and not college educated mothers. The sub-sample analyses indicate that after including controls for income and child care, work hours detract from parenting quality in the not college educated and the not poor samples, but not in the college educated or the poor samples.\nIn Table 4 , we show results from ordered probit models in which we examine the effects of maternal work hours on self-rated overall health of mothers measured at 6 months. The findings suggest that in the full sample, which includes both working and non-working mothers, there are no effects of work hours at 3 months on maternal overall health at 6 months. However, among mothers who are employed or on leave at 6 months, higher work hours at 3 months is associated with a reduction in overall health. This effect is small in magnitude -a 10 hour increase in work hours at 3 months (about a 40 percent increase) is associated with a 2 percent reduction in the probability of being in excellent health, and a 2 percent increase in the probability of being in good health.\nIn the appendix, we show results from models in which we use alternative definitions of work hours, and results from models in which we examine characteristics of work at 6 months.\nRather than use the number of weekly hours worked at the 3 month interview, in Appendix Table   1 we use 1) the average hours per week worked over the child's life (i.e. in the first 6 months); 2) the average weekly hours reported in the one month and three month interviews; and 3) three indicator variables for the categories of working 1 to 20 hours per week at last interview, working 21 to 39 hours per week at last interview, and working at least 40 hours per week at last interview. The models shown in these tables use the same set of covariates used in column 3 of Tables 3a and 3b . We use this specification because it includes the most complete set of covariates, while still providing an estimate of the total effect of work hours on the outcomes.\nThe results in Appendix Table 1 ). This increase in depressive symptoms, however, does not translate into an increase in the likelihood of having a CES-D score greater than 16 (Appendix Table 1 ). The probability of being in poor health is not associated with work hours, nor is the parenting quality score. Parenting stress, however, is increasing with hours of work among women in the employed sample. Women who work any of the categories of hours (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) and 40+) at 3 months report more stress relative to their employed counterparts who are on leave and working zero hours at 3 months (Panel B, Appendix Table 1 ). This result does not hold in the corresponding model using the full sample (Panel A, Appendix Table 1 ).\nAppendix Table 2 shows the effects of different job characteristics on the maternal health and parenting outcomes among the sample of employed women. The job characteristics considered are: whether flexible hours are available, whether the job requires overnight travel, whether the mother works non-standard hours, and whether the mother works from home 10 hours or more a week. We interpret these findings with caution since these characteristics are measured at 6 months (the mothers did not provide information on flexible hours and overnight travel at the 3 month telephone interview). Two findings are notable. First, more hours of work at 3 months are still associated with more depressive symptoms and parenting stress at 6 months, even when controls for work characteristics are included in the model. Second, although flexible hours and overnight travel are not statistically associated with any of the health and parenting outcomes, non-standard work hours are associated with increases in depressive symptoms of 16 to 18 percent, as well as increases in the parenting stress index. The ability to work from home at least 10 hours per week is associated with a reduction of in the probability of being in fair or poor health, although the size of this effect appears to be implausibly large.\nTo summarize, the results thus far demonstrate that work hours, particularly full-time work hours, at 3 months have adverse effects on maternal depressive symptoms, parenting stress, and overall maternal health measured at 6 months. But these effects do not appear to have clinical ramifications since work hours are not associated with the quality of parenting (as measured by a trained observer) or dichotomous indicators of depression and fair/poor health.\nThe next question to ask is if these detrimental effects persist when we examine the child's first 4.5 years of life (1 mo. -54 mo. interview). In Table 5 , we present two sets of findings estimated using a sample that pools data from the 1 month to the 54 month interviews.\nThe first set of findings are estimates from standard OLS models with robust standard errors adjusted for clustering on respondent id. These models are based on our preferred specification estimates. In these models, we account for both state dependence as well as unobserved heterogeneity, and we treat the dependent variables as continuous in all cases.\nIn Table 5 , two findings are notable. First, for all outcomes, the pooled OLS models show strong state dependence. However, once the individual fixed effect is acknowledged in the A-B model, state dependence is no longer apparent in the log CES-D, parenting stress, and parenting quality outcomes. In the case of the depressed, poor/fair health, and overall health outcomes, state dependence still exists, but its importance is diminished considerably once fixed effects are considered. Second, there is no evidence that the detrimental effects of maternal employment we observed at the 6 month interview persist during early childhood. In fact, more maternal work hours is associated with reductions in parenting stress, perhaps because mothers find combining work and child care satisfying once children grow older. More maternal work hours is associated with lower overall health, but the magnitude of this effect appears to be small, and we find no effect of work hours on the likelihood of being in fair/poor health.\nAs expected, we reject the null of zero autocorrelation in the test for order 1 autocorrelation. We fail to reject order 2 autocorrelation in all models except the parenting stress model. This result suggests no autocorrelation in the original error term in any of the models aside from the parenting stress model. We fail to reject the overidentifying assumptions in all models expect parenting stress and log CES-D. Overall, then, the A-B model appears appropriate in all models expect for parenting stress, and we have some concern about the identifying assumptions in the CES-D model as well."}, {"section_title": "VI. Conclusions", "text": "Prior work on the effects of maternal employment has focused on child outcomes. In this paper, we add to the literature by examining effects of maternal work on maternal health and parenting outcomes. We find that among employed mothers, work hours measured when infants are about 3 months old are positively associated with depressive symptoms and parenting stress, as well as a small decline in self-reported overall health, measured when infants are about 6 months old. The effects on depression are driven by mothers who are working full-time at 3 months post-childbirth, while for parenting stress, any level of work hours at 3 months is associated with adverse effects. The only work characteristic that appeared to affect outcomes was alternate shift work, which is associated with more depressive symptoms and parenting stress at 6 months.\nHowever, these detrimental effects do not persist as children get older. During the first 4.5 years of children's lives as a whole, more work hours is not associated with depression, and has very small detrimental effects on maternal overall health. If anything, more maternal work hours reduces parenting stress during the first 4.5 years.\nThese findings are consistent with those of Brooks-Gunn et al. 2010, who use structural equation modeling and data from the SECC to assess the effects of first-year maternal employment on children's outcomes up to age 7. They find that there are both negative and positive effects of maternal employment on children's cognitive, social, and emotional outcomes, but the net effect on children is zero (Brooks-Gunn et al., 2010). We find that for maternal health and parenting outcomes, full-time maternal employment at 3 months detracts from mothers' health and increases stress at 6 months post childbirth. These effects are unlikely to have long-term effects on families since (1) maternal employment affects depressive symptoms, but does not affect the CES-D threshold for a likely clinical case of depression; (2) the effects on maternal overall health are statistically significant, but small in magnitude; and (3) self-reported parenting stress is affected, but objective measurement of parenting quality is not affected.\nMoreover, when the first 4.5 years post-childbirth are considered as a whole, there is no pattern of negative effects of maternal employment on maternal health and parenting.\nHowever, the results still suggest that the transition back into employment immediately after childbirth is difficult for the average family, detracting from maternal health and increasing self-reported parenting stress. These findings emphasize the need for parental leave policies that allow new parents to take longer leave, and/or work fewer hours in the first few months after childbirth.
