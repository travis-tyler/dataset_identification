[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In 2013, two groups independently identified a rare variant in TREM2 (p.R47H) that increased risk for AD almost three-fold, which is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD since the identification of APOE \u03b54 30 years earlier (1, 2). TREM2 p.R47H has also been associated with clinical, imaging, and neuropathological AD phenotypes, including advanced behavioral symptoms, gray matter atrophy, and Braak staging (3, 4) . Since then, additional rare variants in TREM2 have been associated with AD risk including p.R62H, p.H157Y, p.R98W, p.D87N, p.T66M, p.Y38C, and p.Q33X (1, 5-7).\nTREM2 encodes a protein that is part of a transmembrane receptor-signaling complex essential for the immune response of myeloid cells such as microglia. TREM2 is highly and specifically expressed in microglia in the central nervous system (CNS) where it plays a key role in microglial activation, survival, and phagocytosis (8) (9) (10) (11) . Recent evidence from animal models of AD suggest that TREM2 has a complex relationship with the key proteins involved in AD pathogenesis, amyloid-\u03b2 and tau. There is conflicting studies about the role of TREM2 in amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) pathology. TREM2 has been associated with phagocytosis in the presence of A\u03b2 (12) . Plaque-associated neuritic dystrophy was more severe (13, 14) and neuron loss was exaggerated in mice deficient for TREM2, in a gene-dose dependent manner (9) . Elevating levels of TREM2 through the introduction of a human TREM2 transgene reduced pathology and rescued cognitive function in amyloid-bearing mice (15) . On the other hand, a common phenotype across mouse models of amyloidosis is that reduction or loss of Trem2 leads to fewer amyloid plaque-associated microglia (9, 14, 16) . Other studies indicate that Trem2 deficiency protects against neurodegeneration through a dampened microglial-response to tau pathology (17, 18) .\nIn addition to the full-length TREM2 that makes up part of the transmembrane receptor, there is a soluble form of TREM2 (sTREM2) that may be produced by alternative splicing or proteolytic cleavage of the full-length protein (6, 12, 19) . Three distinct transcripts for TREM2 were found in human brain tissue, including a short transcript alternatively spliced to exclude exon 4 thus encoding the transmembrane domain predicted for sTREM2 (6) . Recently a cleavage site was identified on TREM2 that can be targeted by ADAM10, ADAM17, gamma-secretase, and possibly other proteases, to generate sTREM2 (20, 21) . sTREM2 is released into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) where it can be quantified (12, (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) . CSF sTREM2 levels are hypothesized to increase in response to microglia activation due to neurodegenerative processes (23, 26) . Our group and others have demonstrated that CSF sTREM2 levels are elevated in AD (22, 23, 25) . Changes in CSF sTREM2 appear to occur after amyloid accumulation, beginning approximately five years before clinical symptom onset in autosomal dominant forms of AD (24) . Additionally, CSF sTREM2 levels are positively correlated with CSF tau and ptau levels, but not with CSF A\u03b2 42 , suggesting that sTREM2 may be associated with pathological processes occurring after the accumulation of A\u03b2 (22, 23, 25) . Thus, CSF sTREM2 levels represent an important and dynamic biomarker of disease processes throughout AD pathogenesis.\nOur group and others have shown that using CSF biomarkers of complex diseases as quantitative endophenotypes can identify genes that contribute to key biological pathways involved in disease (28) (29) (30) . In this study, we aimed to identify genetic modifiers of CSF sTREM2 levels. We conducted a genome wide association study (GWAS) of CSF sTREM2 levels from more than 1,390 individuals and have successfully detected a locus within the MS4A gene region (11q12.2) that shows novel genome-wide significant association with sTREM2 levels. We have also used bioinformatic, transcriptomic, and cellular approaches to test association between MS4A genes and TREM2. Based on these findings, we propose that the MS4A gene family contains a key regulator of sTREM2."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The goal of this study was to identify genetic modifiers of CSF sTREM2 levels and to better understand the role of sTREM2 in biological pathways relevant to AD.

There were 606 AD cases and 207 cognitively normal controls in based on clinical diagnosis, none of whom carried previously identified risk mutations in TREM2 (Table   1) .\nWe tested the correlation between age at the time of lumbar puncture (LP) and CSF sTREM2 levels and found a positive correlation, consistent with our previous reports (Pearson r = 0.270, P = 4.66\u00d710 -15 ; Supplementary Figure S1 ) (23) . We also tested CSF sTREM2 levels stratified by sex to determine whether sTREM2 levels were higher in males than females, as previously reported (23) (24) (25) 31) . There was no significant difference between CSF sTREM2 levels in males (3,926 \u00b1 1,969 pg/mL) versus females (3,873 \u00b1 1,856 pg/mL, one-tailed P = 0.347; Fig S1) .

There was a significant difference in CSF sTREM2 levels between TREM2 risk variant carriers (P = 0.042) as reported previously (23) .

A total of 7,320,475 genotyped and imputed variants passed strict quality control as described in the methods. TREM2 risk-variant carriers were excluded from the GWAS analyses. We replicated the association of rs1582763 with elevated CSF sTREM2 levels (z = 5.743, P = 9.28\u00d710 -9 ; Figure 2) . A meta-analysis including the ADNI and the replication dataset showed a strong association between rs1582763 and CSF sTREM2 levels (P meta = 4.48\u00d710 -21 ; Fig 2) .\nAdditionally, we replicated the association between rs6591561 (MS4A4A p.M159V) and reduced CSF sTREM2 levels in the independent dataset (z = -3.715, P = 2.03\u00d710 -4 ). A meta-analysis with the ADNI discovery dataset provided a p-value of P = 1.65\u00d710 -11 . Individual results for each dataset are shown in Supplementary Table S3 . Comparisons between MS4A association and APOE APOE genotype is the strongest genetic risk factor for AD (32) and APOE \u03b54 is the strongest genetic association for CSF A\u03b2 42 and tau levels (30, 33) . To determine whether APOE genotype is associated with CSF sTREM2 levels, we created a variable representing APOEmediated AD risk by recoding APOE genotype for each individual as 0 for \u03b52/\u03b52, 1 for \u03b52/\u03b53, 2 for \u03b53/\u03b53, 3 for \u03b52/\u03b54, 4 for \u03b53/\u03b54, and 5 for \u03b54/\u03b54. We added this APOE genotype risk variable to a regression model, adjusting for age, sex, and two PCs for population stratification, and found that APOE genotype was not significantly associated with CSF sTREM2 levels (\u03b2 = -26.5, P = 0.613). The SNP commonly used as a proxy for APOE \u03b54, rs769449, was also not associated with CSF sTREM2 levels (\u03b2 = -106.9, P = 0.308).\nThe influence of APOE genotype on A\u03b2 pathology, and thereby biomarkers for A\u03b2 pathology, including CSF A\u03b242, has been a consistent finding (30, 34) . Within the same subset of individuals, the effect size of rs1582763 on CSF sTREM2 levels was similar (\u03b2 = 0.366, P = 7.53\u00d710 -13 ) to that of APOE on CSF A\u03b2 42 levels (\u03b2 = -0.361, P = 1.69\u00d710 -34 ). When comparing the lower vs. upper quartiles of CSF sTREM2 levels, rs1582763\nhad an OR = 3.34 for higher CSF sTREM2 (95% CI = 2.37 -4.82, P = 2.50\u00d710 -11 ), which is similar to the effect of APOE on CSF A\u03b2 42 levels (OR = 2.84, 95% CI 2.30 -3.56). Thus, the impact of rs1582763, in the MS4A gene region, on CSF sTREM2 levels is similar to that of APOE, the major regulator of AD risk, on CSF A\u03b2 42 levels."}, {"section_title": "Additional genes associated with CSF sTREM2 levels", "text": "To identify genes associated with CSF sTREM2 levels, we used MAGMA, which maps every SNP to the closest gene, takes into account the LD structure, and uses multiple regression analyses to provide a p-value for the association of each gene with CSF sTREM2 levels.

However, the mouse ortholog for MS4A6A is Ms4a6e and there is no mouse ortholog for MS4A4A (38, 39) . Thus, to understand the role of MS4A genes on TREM2 function, it is essential to use human models. To begin evaluating the functional connection between TREM2 and MS4A4A and MS4A6A, we examined human macrophages, which are myeloid cells expressing TREM2 and can serve as a surrogate for microglia (40) .\nTo examine the therapeutic potential of targeting these MS4A proteins on sTREM2 levels, we used an antibody-based approach. Human macrophages were derived in vitro from blood monocytes and media from the cells was tested for the presence of sTREM2 by ELISA in the presence or absence of the cytokine IL-4 as previously described (26) . IL-4-mediated macrophage stimulation results in upregulation of TREM2 and MS4A4A (41) . sTREM2 was detected in the macrophage media beginning at day 3-post isolation and sTREM2 levels increased progressively with time in culture (Supplementary Figure S9) . On day 7, stimulation with IL-4 significantly increased levels of sTREM2 in the media ( Figure 4A ). Next, we evaluated whether antibody-mediated targeting of MS4A4A or MS4A6A would impact sTREM2 levels. Human macrophages were treated with commercially available antibodies to MS4A4A, MS4A6A, and isotope controls (see methods for details) on day 7 and sTREM2 was measured in the media 48 hours after treatment. We found that antibodies directed to MS4A4A [N-terminal cytoplasmic domain (A) and extracellular domain (B)] were sufficient to significantly reduce extracellular sTREM2 levels (Fig. 4B) . Treatment of human macrophages with an MS4A6A\nantibody (N-terminal cytoplasmic domain) failed to alter sTREM2 levels (Fig. 4B) . We observed similar results when macrophages were stimulated with IL-4 (Fig. 4B) . Thus, targeting MS4A4A\nwith specific antibodies is sufficient to modify sTREM2 levels under basal conditions and with stimulus. However, due to limited availability of MS4A6A reagents, we cannot yet exclude the possibility that antibodies engaging extracellular epitopes on MS4A6A could also impact sTREM2 levels.

MS4A4A has been previously shown to localize on monocyte/macrophages plasma membrane (41) and on the plasma membrane and intracellular organelles in human mast cells, where it may play a role in intracellular protein trafficking (42) . While we observed some MS4A4A staining at the plasma membrane in the human macrophages, we detected the strongest signal in intracellular organelles mainly localized in the juxta-nuclear region (Fig. 4C ). Confocal analysis revealed that MS4A4A\nand TREM2 co-localize in the same intracellular structures and, to a lesser extent, on the plasma membrane (Fig. 4C) . Consistent with the sTREM2 findings and previous reports (40, 41) , IL-4-mediated stimulation of the human macrophages significantly increased expression of both MS4A4A and TREM2 (Fig. S9 )."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this study, we performed a genome-wide analysis for genetic modifiers of CSF sTREM2 levels. We observed two independent signals in the MS4A gene region that pass genome-wide significance thresholds for association with CSF sTREM2 levels: rs1582763 and rs6591561 (MS4A4A p.M159V). Importantly, rs1582763 is associated with elevated CSF sTREM2 levels and reduced AD risk (43) and delayed age-at-onset (39) . Conversely, rs6591561\nencoding MS4A4A p.M159V is associated with reduced CSF sTREM2 levels and increased AD risk and accelerated age-at-onset (39) . These SNPs modify MS4A4A and MS4A6A in human blood and brain tissue and are highly correlated with TREM2 gene expression. In human macrophages, MS4A4A and TREM2 co-localize in intracellular compartments and antibodymediated targeting of MS4A4A results in a significant reduction of sTREM2. Thus, we present genetic, molecular, and functional studies that suggest that MS4A genes are key regulators of sTREM2.\nOur findings that variants in the MS4A gene region are associated with CSF sTREM2 levels provides a biological connection between the MS4A gene cluster, TREM2, and AD risk.\nPrior to this study, TREM2 has been directly implicated in AD through the identification of rare variants that increase AD risk (1, 2). However, the role of TREM2 in sporadic disease was less clear. Common variants in the MS4A locus are associated with AD risk (rs1582763, OR = 0.898, P = 1.81\u00d710 -15 ) (43) and delayed age-at-onset (HR = 0.929, P = 9.26\u00d710 -9 ) (39), but the functional variant and mechanism of action has been unknown until now. Here, we show that variants within this AD risk locus modify CSF sTREM2 levels. Previous research has already suggested that changes in sTREM2 levels, or TREM2 biology in general, are likely involved in disease pathology (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) 24) . These MS4A variants also impact MS4A4A and MS4A6A expression in human blood and brain tissue, as previously reported (44, 45) .\nThe two independent signals in the MS4A gene region have opposing effects on CSF sTREM2 levels, which has important implications for MS4A and TREM2 biology in AD pathogenesis. Interestingly, studies in AD mouse models suggest that loss of Trem2 has opposing effects on amyloid-and tau-mediated pathology (14, 16, 46) . How CSF sTREM2 levels change throughout human disease remains poorly understood and is an area of active investigation.\nHowever, our findings that a SNP, rs1582763, which is associated with elevated CSF sTREM2 levels is also associated with reduced AD risk and delayed age-at-onset point to a protective role for sTREM2 in AD. Consistently, the second independent SNP, rs6591561, is associated with reduced CSF sTREM2 levels, increased AD risk, and accelerated age-at-onset, suggesting that lower CSF sTREM2 is associated with a more severe disease course. We cannot say yet whether CSF sTREM2 levels are a biomarker for inflammatory or other non-specific processes in the brain, or whether CSF sTREM2 levels more directly contribute to disease pathology.\nWe still have a poor understanding of the origin and function of sTREM2. Three distinct transcripts for TREM2 were found in human brain tissue, including a short transcript alternatively spliced to exclude exon 4 thus encoding the transmembrane domain predicted for sTREM2 (6) . Recently a cleavage site was found on TREM2 that is cleaved by ADAM10, ADAM17, to generate sTREM2 (20, 21) . The majority of studies of the role of TREM2 in AD pathogenesis have focused on characterizing the functional impact of TREM2 rare risk variants by using animal and cell models. Some researchers suggest that sTREM2 functions to bind to and sequester TREM2 ligands, such as apolipoproteins, thus preventing them from activating the TREM2 receptor (47, 48) . Others propose that sTREM2 functions independently of the TREM2 receptor, as the introduction of sTREM2 alters microglia survival and cytokine release in Trem2 We present two lines of evidence suggesting that genes within the MS4A cluster regulate sTREM2. First, the strength of the signal in MS4A gene locus and the consistent association across datasets (P meta = 4.48\u00d710 -21 ; Fig 2) . For comparison, the effect size (OR = 3.34; 95% CI = 2.37 -4.82) of rs1582763 on CSF sTREM2 levels is similar to that of the APOE genotype on CSF A\u03b2 42 levels (OR = 2.84; 95% CI = 2.30 -3.50). Second, the MS4A association with CSF sTREM2 levels represents a trans effect: TREM2 is located on chromosome 9 and this MS4A locus is on chromosome 11. As our group and others have reported, it is not common to find trans-protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) with large effect sizes (35, (50) (51) (52) (53) (54) . Most transpQTLs occur in genes which encode receptors or that have other regulatory influences on the protein studied. For example, variants located on 3p21.31 were significantly associated (rs145617407: \u03b2 = 0.348, P = 2.58\u00d710 -10 ) with plasma levels of macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta (MIP1b), a protein which is encoded by C-C motif chemokine ligand 4 (CCL4) located on 17q12 (50, 54) . The 3p21.31 locus contains genes which encode five members of the C-C motif chemokine receptor family (CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR5, and CCR9) including a known receptor for CCL4 (CCR5) (55) . Thus, we hypothesize that one or more genes within the MS4A locus are key regulators of sTREM2.\nOur study also implicates MS4A4A as a potential therapeutic target for AD. MS4A4A\nco-localizes with TREM2 in human macrophages and both proteins are upregulated in response to IL-4-mediated stimulation. TREM2 and MS4A4A are highly expressed in human microglia (37) . While little is known of MS4A4A function in the brain, MS4A4A may be involved in protein trafficking and clathrin-dependent endocytosis (42) . Our findings that antibody-mediated targeting of MS4A4A was sufficient to reduce sTREM2 levels in human macrophages illustrates a putative relationship between these two proteins. Additional studies are needed to fully understand the mechanism for which MS4A4A affects sTREM2 levels. Compounds that impact MS4A4A levels or block its function could modify AD risk, by regulating brain sTREM2 levels."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Ethics statement", "text": "The Institutional Review Boards of all participating institutions approved the study and research was carried out in accordance with the approved protocols.

Gene expression was inferred using Salmon v0.7.2 (67) transcript expression quantification of the coding transcripts of Homo sapiens included in the GENCODE reference genome (GRCh37.75). Gene counts data were transformed to stabilize expression variances along the range of mean values and normalized according to library size using the variance stabilizing transformation (VST) function in DESeq2 (68) . Correlations between expression of TREM2 and each member of the MS4A gene family, with an average TPM > 1, were tested in each independent RNA-seq cohort."}, {"section_title": "Bioinformatics annotation", "text": "All variants below the threshold for suggestive significance (P < 1\u00d710 -5 ) were taken forward for functional annotation using ANNOVAR version 2015-06-17 (69) and examined for potential regulatory functions using HaploReg v4.1 (70) Homo sapiens, to examine DNA elements affected by the associated SNPs."}, {"section_title": "Human macrophages cultures", "text": "Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were purified from human blood on FicollPaque PLUS density gradient (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).
