One key advancement produced by the international professional interest area (PIA) on blood based biomarkers was the generation of the first-ever guidelines for pre-analytic processing of specimens 8 . This first-step was the result of a tremendous effort spanning industry and academic investigators from across the globe. It provided a basic set of pre-analytic processing variables to be followed (and refined) and a minimum set of information that should to be provided within publications to allow for appropriately designed studies of cross-validation. More recently, this workgroup published data comparing biomarkers from the same blood draw (person, date and time) across assay platforms and blood fraction (serum and plasma) 9 . Results indicated that individual markers, while oftentimes statistically significantly correlated, may share minimal variance across platform or tissue indicating that direct comparisons are oftentimes not possible. Differences in concentration for specific analytes on different technology platforms can be lined to calibrators or neat biological samples may not have the same immunoreactivity with the antibodies included.\nAdditionally, the use of different antibodies as well as assay design can impact findings 10 .\nTogether, this work clearly demonstrated additional methodological factors that must be considered when comparing across studies, cohorts, and biorepositories. Andreasson, Blennow and Zetterberg 11 provided an update and overview of ultrasensitive technologies to measure ADrelated biomarkers in blood as well as CSF. While still early in the process, these novel assay technologies have the capacity to detect very low-levels of markers that may be of tremendous importance when seeking to move from research-grade to \"pharmaceutical-grade\" kits in future attempts to take research use only (RUO) methods towards laboratory developed tests (LDTs) and in vitro diagnostics (IVDs) 12, 13 . As evident from the continued progress of the Global Biomarkers Standardization Consortium of CSF biomarkers (GBSC), the blood-based biomarker field will need to address additional methodological barriers in order to produce clinically useful/applicable biomarkers.\nBlood Biomarkers of AD Risk. An important potential COU for AD biomarker science is the identification of risk, which can take several forms: (1) risk of incident AD among cognitively normal elders, (2) risk of progressing from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD and (3) risk for rapid progression within AD. Biomarkers related to these specific COUs have tremendous potential for clinical intervention trials aimed at preventing AD, halting progression from MCI, as well as slowing progression among patients with manifest AD. Enrichment of these specific subjects into trials has the benefit of reducing the diluting effect of enrolling those subjects not likely to progress. Indeed, an important potential of AD blood biomarkers could be to increase the likelihood of subjects being positive on more expensive (e.g. PET imaging) or invasive (Cerebrospinal fluid, CSF, sampling) screening procedures used later during screening procedures for trial eligibility.\nA substantial amount of work has been conducted examining plasma amyloid markers within the COU of predicting progression of AD 14 , conversion from MCI to AD 15 as well as risk for future AD 16 . In a highly publicized article, Mapstone et al 17 examined plasma lipidomic and metabolomic markers from 525 community-dwelling older adults in an effort to identify a signature of risk for incident aMCI/AD. The authors identified a signature of 10 metabolites that yielded approximately 80% accuracy in discriminating controls from MCI/AD and 90% or greater accuracy in detecting those normal controls who converted to aMCI/AD over time.\nHowever, cross-validation attempts have been unsuccessful. Casanova et al 18 examined these same 10 metabolites in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) and the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study (AGES-RS). In that work, these metabolites yielded an AUC=0.64 (BLSA) and an AUC=0.40 (AGES-RS) in these independent cohorts.\nAdditionally, examining data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, Li and colleagues 19 were unable to cross-validate the cross-sectional discrimination capacity of the 10 metabolites in discriminating normal controls from MCI/AD. Hye et al 20 There has also recently been a surge in research devoted towards the potential utility of exosome markers in predicting and detecting AD and other neurodegenerative diseases [21] [22] [23] .\nRecently, Rissman 24 examined the utility of neuronally-derived exosomes (NDEs) in predicting conversion from MCI to dementia. Alterations in plasma NDE levels of P-tau, A\u03b21-42, NRGN and REST were found among AD and MCI cases that converted to AD within 36 months compared to stable MCI cases and normal controls. Additionally, when injected into the right hippocampus of wild-type (C57/BL6) mice, the NDEs from MCI cases that converted to AD caused increased P-tau when compared to NDEs from normal controls and stable MCI cases.\nThis work significantly advances the utility of exosome biomarkers in AD and, critically, backtranslates these findings into animal models for additional study, which is rarely done. There remains a significant amount of work with regards to standardizing methods for exosome biomarker work; however, strong signals have been identified and suggest the need for additional work.\nAn example of blood-based biomarker that has received a great deal of attention for predicting future risk is plasma clusterin. Levy 25 recently examine plasma clusterin from 1,532 non-demented subjects of the Framingham Study Offspring cohort to determine whether this putative biomarker could predict incident dementia and stroke. Among older adults (age>80), plasma clusterin was associated with increased risk for dementia; however, plasma clusterin was related to a reduced risk of dementia (age 60-69) and stroke (age < 80) among younger participants. These results suggest the importance of considering age when interpreting the predictive utility of this putative biomarker.\nTogether, the above-described studies provide proof-of-concept in support of the potential use of blood-based biomarkers when considering the COU of predicting future risk.\nHowever, a great deal of additional work is required including, but not limited to, independent cross-validation, rigorous standardization of methods and assay technologies, and prospective studies designed to explicitly test the COU (with direct application of specific cut-scores). This COU may, in fact, be the \"Holy Grail\" of AD biomarkers and blood-based biomarkers provide an optimal first step in a multi-stage approach to addressing this COU (e.g. imaging studies will not be reimbursable first-line biomarker strategies for clinical use). It is possible that blood-based biomarkers may serve as the first-line in a multi-stage approach where the biomarker-specific context of use is to rule out those least likely to progress, thereby screening out those who are not in need of more costly and invasive procedures, not only in clinical trial contexts but also in general medical practice. If this is the most valuable COU and market strategy, the design of the studies should be appropriately tailored.\nBiomarkers of AD Diagnosis. The most studied potential COU for blood-based biomarkers in AD are diagnostic biomarkers. Some of this work seeks to identify screening tools for primary care clinics in order to provide a multi-stage approach 5 while others seek to identify diagnostic tools 26 .\nOne area of investigation is that of plasma total tau (T-tau) concentration, which are increased in the dementia stage of AD but the data are less clear in the MCI stage of the disease 27 , and, unfortunately, there is no clear correlation between plasma and CSF T-tau concentrations 28 . A newer marker receiving a significant amount of attention in this COU is neurofilament light (NF-L). In contrast to tau, there is excellent correlation between CSF and plasma concentrations of NF-L 29 . CSF NF-L concentration is increased in both dementia and MCI stages of AD with a similar effect size as that of CSF T-tau 27 , and these findings were recently replicated on serum and plasma samples 30 . The marker is not disease-specific, but should rather be regarded a general marker of axonal degeneration to gauge disease intensity concentrations in the AIBL cohort. The authors found that apoJ levels were significantly higher among MCI and AD cases at both time-points and were also correlated with standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) PET amyloid levels and hippocampal volume. Recently, specific glycosylated forms of clustern have been found to more robust markers within this group. Nagele have conducted a series of studies examining the potential utility of autoantibodies in detecting AD and other neurodegenerative diseases 32, 33 Body Dementia (DLB) and control subjects. The authors found significant plasma ceramide alterations and monohexosylceramide alterations between dementia cases (AD and DLB) and controls suggesting that these biomarkers may have utility in identifying possible AD and/or DLB pathology. O'Bryant and colleagues recently cross-validated a serum-based algorithm for discriminating AD from controls across an independent platform, animal model and brain tissue and demonstrated preliminary data for the algorithm in discriminating AD from PD 36 . More recently, that group 5 created the locked-down referent cohort for an AD blood screen intended for primary care use and demonstrated excellent positive and negative predictive values when compared to screening tests. In the long-term, it is likely that the most viable and applicable COU for blood-based biomarkers within the \"diagnostic\" realm is to serve as the first-step in a multi-stage diagnostic process where CSF and PET amyloid and tau imaging will serve as the final diagnostics of presence of AD pathology 5 . Given the cost of PET and CSF methods relative to blood-based methods, the availability of a blood-based tool that is utilized to determine who does and does not undergo PET and CSF exams has a viable cost strategy, which is also the strategy followed in the cancer arena (PET scans are not first-line diagnostics 37 ). Blood Biomarkers of Amyloid Pathology. Another COU with high potential to aid in clinical trials is the identification of blood-based biomarkers that can identify those individuals with high (or low) likelihood of being amyloid positive [38] [39] [40] . Westwood and colleagues 38 The vast majority of the work described above remains in early stage discovery with only a few instances where multiple cross-validation steps have been undertaken. If these discovery findings are to become clinically meaningful, a great deal of work must be undertaken. For example, there is a significant need to understand the impact of many factors on alterations of these blood-based biomarkers. This is important because \"hallmark\" AD biomarkers have been shown to change in association with factors such as depression, cardiac arrest, head injury as well as hematological and cancer interventions 43, 44 . Additionally, do any of these markers need to be stratified specifically to ApoE4 genotype or concomitant/comorbid diseases? These and other questions are important considerations when moving from initial discovery towards consideration of movement to clinic. The process of moving from discovery to clinic is best undertaken as a partnership between academia and industry/biotech in order to most effectively leverage the available skillsets. In the next section, we provide an updated model for moving biomarker discovery through the stages of development towards clinical implementation."}, {"section_title": "A Public-Private Partnership Paradigm for Moving From", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Biomarker Discovery to Clinical Use", "text": "While both academia and industry have the common goal of identifying biomarkers of AD, there are drastically different perspectives between academia and industry 45 . Further, due to increasing cost structures, industry has put less funds and effort into \"front end\" research and discovery (R&D) 46 . While academia seeks the novel and best solution to a problem, industry focuses on the intended use of a safe and effective product with an identified market value 45 .\nWhile there are several notable exceptions in the drug discovery space (particularly cancer) 46 , academia and industry currently largely work independently with regards to biomarker R&D and continue to inherently follow the traditional \"hand-off\" approach such that academic discoveries are \"handed off\" to industry for further development towards the clinic. There is a large concern regarding the lack of reproducibility of research findings across independent laboratories, within laboratory settings, and particularly from academic laboratory settings to industry settings [47] [48] [49] [50] .\nIndeed, the \"unspoken rule\" among venture capital firms is that 50% (higher if speaking with industry personnel) of published studies will not replicate in industrial labs 50 . Despite the recently outlined NIH plan to address this problem, 48 this \"reproducibility crisis\" remains a significant problem in the eyes of industry 51 . However, this is not an issue that can be resolved by academics (e.g. NIH) or industry alone and an updated model is required. The traditional handoff model of academic biomarker discovery to industry validation is outlined in Figure 1 . The academic model broadly falls into four stages: (1) a case-control cohort is established to examine a wide-range of possible \"biomarkers\", (2) a \"biomarker\" or \"biomarkers\" are statistically shown to be differentially related to disease status (e.g. significant mean group differences, significant fold-change scores), (3) the \"biomarker(s)\" are then correlated with relevant clinical disease endpoints (e.g. memory scores, disease severity, age of onset, rate/risk of progression, amyloid positivity) and finally (4) the context of use (COU) is proposed (e.g. biomarker of disease presence, biomarker of disease risk, biomarker of disease subgroups). Few academic studies in the blood-based biomarker space validate discovery findings across cohorts 52 , much less across technological platforms 36 . Those that do attempt to cross-validate oftentimes fail 53 . To date, one can convincingly argue that no prior work has explicitly validated a blood-based biomarker within a specific COU, which requires a prospective clinical trial 5 . In fact, when reviewing the literature outlined above, few of those studies were validations of previously identified biomarkers. Most were discovery studies following the initial steps (1-3) outlined above. This approach starkly contrasts the productdriven model of industry that begins with defining the COU and validating the fit-for-purpose of this COU with a constant eye towards regulatory pathways and market strategy. While several novel public-private models have been developed for the advancement of drug development 46 , less attention has been focused specifically on the biomarker discovery to clinical use pathway.\nHere we provide a novel integrated partnership model for taking AD biomarkers from discovery to clinic. While much of the examples and discussion focus on blood-based biomarkers, this model is applicable to biomarker development more broadly."}, {"section_title": "Biomarker Development Concepts of Relevance and Available Resources", "text": "There are several relevant resources that can assist in the process of establishing a biomarker discovery program that has the goal of translating these discoveries to clinic.\nBEST (Biomarkers, EndpointS, and other Tools) Resource -\"Effective, unambiguous communication is essential for efficient translation of promising scientific discoveries into approved medical products\" 54 . If there is to be a bridge to not only foster, but expedite the process of going from discovery to clinical implementation, there must be a common language and working definitions for key terms. To that end, the can be applied not only to 'omics' methods, but other biomarker discovery technologies. In the blood-based AD biomarker space, the vast majority of work has remained within the \"Discovery Phase\" without the additional work required for the \"Test Validation Phase\", which has traditionally been the \"handoff\" to industry.\nFit-for-Purpose Biomarker Validation 56 -The fit-for-purpose biomarker validation methods were proposed to assist in the development and validation of clinically useful biomarkers. These methods were developed on the basis that biomarkers would have the capacity to identify the most promising drug candidates within the drug development pipeline 56 . First, the intended use or COU is determined, which guides the remaining steps. These guidelines place the steps within the equivalent steps for pharmacokinetic (PK) assay, biomarker assay for drug development and biomarker assay for diagnostic development. Once the COU is defined, these methods can be placed within the IOM model using the BEST terminology (see new model proposed below). In the AD blood-based biomarker space, the recently published preanalytic guidelines can assist with the design of the fit-for-purpose steps in biomarker discovery and development 8 . If the ultimate goal is to generate a laboratory developed test (LDT), clinical trial assay (CTA) or in vitro diagnostic (IVD), the CLSI and CLIA guidelines must also be reviewed and incorporated into the program development from the beginning.\nIn addition to the resources outlined above, there are three important commonalities found across biomarker development programs that have progressed from discovery to clinical implementation and should be considered from program inception 45 : (1) predefined vision of the commercialization path, (2) straightforward and controllable manufacturing process and, (3) focus on applied research 45 ."}, {"section_title": "Defining the Context of Use (COU)", "text": "While the definition of the COU is outlined above, this point warrants additional consideration.\nThe COU sets the entire stage of science for any new putative biomarker and the importance of this step cannot be overstated as it is largely ignored in academic discovery science. While Industry-lead work has less room for basic biology discovery, this is one of the primary objectives of academic work. However, there are many interesting, novel and potentially useful discoveries that have little to no chance to reach the clinic or impact patient care. Within the development of the COU, conceptualization and inception phases should include the following considerations: scalability, manufacturability, compatibility with traditional large-scale methods, intellectual property (IP), and regulatory pathway 45 . When using a blood-based biomarker for detecting AD in primary care clinics, each of these points will be considered individually:\n1. Scalability -If the COU for the blood based biomarker is defined as \"a detection tool for primary care clinics to determine which patients should or should not be referred for additional cost-intensive and invasive procedures\", how does scalability become a consideration? First, there are currently over 40 million Americans age 65 and above and this segment of the population will grow dramatically in the near future 57 . If a novel biomarker is to fit the CMS-regulated annual wellness visit (AWV), which is a current need based on the 2015 report of the Gerontological Society of America 58 , it must be available to all primary care clinics. This translates to a biomarker platform that can potentially be performed on over 10,000 patients daily. Therefore, is this biomarker (or biomarker assay) sufficiently scalable to be offered to everyone in need? If the biomarker requires specialized equipment, cumbersome pre-analytic procedures or even a single reference lab, this biomarker will not meet the scalability needs of primary care providers."}, {"section_title": "Manufacturability -Academic investigators excel in creating new and novel procedures", "text": "that surpass currently available methods. However, it is important to consider whether the product components can be produced at a level that will meet the 10,000 patients per day scale? If this is a new and novel platform, how easy is it utilized and produced? If this is a new biomarker (or set of biomarkers) that leverages existing platforms (e.g. ELISA) can the antibodies and reagents meet CLIA and similar requirements and be produced largescale reliably? What is the long-term availability of antibodies (there are inherent difficulties with long-term availability with polyclonal antibodies)? If not, a potentially scalable biomarker without available manufacturing components will have to meet that latter need prior to being considered for movement towards clinic."}, {"section_title": "Compatibility with traditional large-scale methods -A blood-based biomarker serving", "text": "the first-step in the AD assessment process for primary care providers offers advantages to increasing appropriate access to invasive and costly methods for confirmatory diagnostics (as well as therapies); however, how does this biomarker make it to primary care providers? There is an existing large-scale (global) network of companies specifically designed to collect and analyze blood samples at a scale far beyond 10,000 patients per day. However, can this biomarker fit into that infrastructure? Can this biomarker work with the existing global network of companies already providing primary care clinics with daily blood work results? If not, this barrier must be considered before the path to clinic can be realized."}, {"section_title": "IP and Regulatory Considerations -One phrase commonly heard in public-private-", "text": "partnership meetings is \"academics discover things and industry brings things to patients.\" A new and novel biomarker that meets all of the outlined needs above that does not have an adequately structured IP strategy has little to no chance to reach patients because there will be no financial incentive to capture an industry partner. Considerations regarding regulatory issues early in the process also help appropriately design the studies, without which much of the data produced in the academic laboratory will likely be rendered useless when the regulatory path is realized.\nTogether, these points provide a contextual pathway to move academic discovery toward clinical utilization. As can be seen in Figure 1 , the standard inherent approach in academic research does not consider these points, which explains a tremendous amount of the failure to replicate academic findings in industry settings. This lack of replication has little to do with the soundness of the academic research, but more to do with the context within which the work was conducted.\nRather than the traditional \"handoff\" model of scientific discovery findings to industry laboratories, a partnership that leverages the strengths of academic centers, pharma and diagnostic/biotech companies at the outset can greatly expedite getting new and better tools into the clinic in a manageable timeframe. Figure 2 Academic partners are responsible for identifying and discovering new biomarkers that may have market potential. However, the current model of incorporation of industry and biotech from the outset allows for rapid communication of novel ideas and findings that can be considered from a marketable lens. Provide new and novel COUs for the biomarkers, generate improved methods and technologies that offer significant advantages to available biomarkers with similar COUs (keeping in mind that it is exceedingly difficult to \"beat good enough\" in the marketplace), and identify the infrastructure upon which to build the program of research. Industry Roles:\nEvaluate the COU within the competitive landscape, market value and opportunity, and focus on relevant endpoints and understanding the Regulatory pathway for assay and clinical validation as well as the potential for approval.

Detailed documentation of methods used across all aspects is critical, from sample collection and processing, to assay technological aspects and analytic/postprocessing. These methods will require deep-level qualification and lock-down at later stages. If academic investigators utilize discovery platforms within the discovery science, this further complicates the methodological standardization needs further down. Therefore, any biomarkers identified/discovered utilizing a discovery-based assay technology should immediately be crossvalidated on an established technology or the discovery technology must be locked down prior to additional studies. Industry Roles: Independent analysis of the data, generate the strategy for regulatory approval, consider the market entry point and strategy to market (i.e. scalability of technology, fit with existing medical infrastructure, etc.), consider payer issues, (e.g. considerations for reimbursement strategy), consider scalability of the discovered biomarker technology, and discuss IP strategy and technology startup needs (e.g. new company [NewCo], fold into existing biotech). Additionally, industry scientists must work with academic scientists to examine the performance parameters of the assay technology. If discovery-based technologies were utilized, academic and industry/biotech scientists must outline the plan to either (1) validate findings on an independent technological platform with known assay validity or (2) outline the process for validation of the discovery platform.

Industry Roles: Finalize COU statement in Regulatory aligned format that is clearly articulated (in terms that fit with regulatory needs), validate proofof-principal findings in STAGE 3 on a blinded set or initial small-scale prospective study utilizing standardized locked-down methods. If the technology requires transition to different platform (to meet production and scalability needs), additional bridge-study work will be required to refine the locked-down methods and compare findings on new platform/technology to that from the discovery platform utilizing the initial study banked samples and new study.\nLastly, Regulatory consultation to obtain guidance for path to clinical trials and approval procedures are required (e.g. LDT versus IVD regulatory considerations, a companion diagnostic biomarker for a drug is approved with the drug whereas a new device may require a 510k exemption or approval). Academic Roles: Recruit new clinical subjects for industry study per locked-down methods, possibly conduct the biomarker studies (e.g. if biomarker is assay-based and academic lab has, as will be required within the Regulatory framework, CLIA lab or 510k approved platforms in-house), work with industry partners to transfer technological methods to widely-available and Regulatory-approved platforms and partner on appropriate bridge-studies, work with the industry partner to the refine locked-down methods and referent cohort, if applicable. The academic role in Stage 4 is of key importance as this public-private partnership model avoids the \"handoff\" and allows for the scientists that discovered the technology to explicitly partner with the industry scientists for transfer of the methods rather than a simple handoff. It is possible (and likely) that additional work will be needed to successfully transfer the methods. This stage is likely the most important critical juncture to avoid failure of the technology in clinical trials.

"}, {"section_title": "Placing Blood-Based Biomarkers into a Broader Context", "text": "It is important to keep in mind where blood-based biomarkers potentially fit within the bigger picture for specific COUs. With regards to AD diagnostics, the majority of work in the AD space on biomarkers has focused on CSF and imaging modalities, which will likely be the confirmatory diagnostic procedures. However, first-line biomarkers are needed to fit the needs of the rapidly growing aging segment of the population. As was the case with breast cancer screening 30-years ago, primary care screening tools are needed for AD though significant issues related to fear, stigma and misinformation remain 59 . Additionally, when considering the historical context of the emergence of diagnostic imaging technologies for breast cancer along with the regulatory and reimbursement approval patterns of those technologies 37 , the availability of cost-and resource-effective strategies for staging the allocation of diagnostic resources in AD that fit within the existing medical infrastructure will likely not only increase the likelihood of Regulatory approval for additional imaging modalities, this development would also likely result in a more rapid speed-to-market. It is important to be clear that, at this point, blood-based biomarkers are not viewed as \"diagnostic\", but rather they are the potential first-line in the multistaged diagnostic process, are more cost-and time-effective than other biomarker technologies, and may yield excellent accuracy when compared to primary care screening tools with similar COU 5 . Therefore, the availability of such screening tools for primary care settings should enhance appropriate access to more advanced diagnostic strategies. When considering therapeutics, blood-based biomarkers can serve important roles in increasing access to disease modifying and other Regulatory approved AD therapeutics. When put within the COU of an AD multi-stage neuro-diagnostic process, Figure 3 provides a landscape for immediate biomarker opportunities. Clear Regulatory pathways and fit-for-purpose biomarker validation studies could be immediately generated with these goals. Blood-based biomarkers have clear advantages over PET technologies for front-line testing, but PET and CSF biomarkers can provide final confirmatory (and differential) diagnostics. There is a non-overlapping, but complementary COU landscape that fits within the current medical infrastructure and each technology can be scalable to meet the needs of the population; however, neither biomarker is capable of fitting the COU of the other.\nBlood-based biomarkers also offer significant advancements to the clinical trial structure, for patient selection as well as potentially monitoring treatment response. For selection into trials, blood-based biomarkers can be utilized as the initial screening process to (1) increase access to clinical trials beyond specialty clinic settings, while simultaneously (2) reducing the cost and resource burden in the screening process. PET and CSF biomarkers can then serve as the differential diagnostic step. Overall, this two-step process would significantly reduce time to randomization and reduce overall resources needed for trial start-up. With regards to monitoring treatment response, the traditional outcome in AD clinical trials are change in cognitive test scores (i.e. decreased decline within a period of timetypically 12-24 months). Given the slow nature of cognitive change, this outcome by default requires lengthy trial designs thereby increasing cost, reducing patent life and providing an overall unfavorable cost landscape.\nTherefore, there has been a significant interest in predictive and response biomarkers. Bloodbased biomarkers may have utility to provide a cost-effective means for the identification of predictive biomarkers that identify specific subsets of patients most likely to respond to a given therapy 2, 60 , which is a key focus of blood-based (genetic, proteomic and other) markers in the precision medicine approach to cancer therapy (e.g. EGFR in predicting response to non-small cell lung cancer, BRCA1/2 mutations in predicting response among women with ovarian cancer).\nIt is also possible that blood-based biomarkers have the potential to rule out those who may respond unfavorably to specific therapies. CSF and imaging biomarkers may have roles in the generation of predictive biomarkers, which are being examined as secondary outcomes in many ongoing trials. Response biomarkers have tremendous potential to change the landscape of AD clinical trials. Specifically, if a change in a biomarker is a sign of treatment response (i.e. improved cognition), such a marker could conceivably be introduced as a surrogate biomarker for the primary outcome rather than change in cognition. Recent work suggests that early change in plasma S100\u03b2 and neuron specific enolase (NSE) may predict six month clinical outcomes in stroke patients 61 and this area has been studied extensively in cancer [62] [63] [64] . The ideal situation would be the identification of such a response biomarker that changes within six months, thereby significantly decreasing the time of the clinical trials. If blood-based biomarkers can be utilized for the sub-stratification of specific patient populations most likely to respond to a given therapy, change in that biomarker over time can be evaluated as a potential response biomarker. Overall, the evidence and focus on utilization of any biomarkers as outcomes in clinical trials targeting AD has been weak, which is in part related to the regulatory requirements for Phase 3 trials in the space. However, if the COU of the biomarkers are outlined from the inception of the drug development program and built into all stages of development via fit-for-purpose steps, this process can significantly improve the trial process 65 . Given their use for other diseases, it is likely that blood-based biomarkers can significantly improve the clinical trial design and precision medicine model for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases (Figure 4) ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Overall, there has been substantial progress in the area of blood-based biomarkers in AD.\nRecent discovery-based work has identified potential biomarkers that predict future risk of AD among cognitively normal older adults, risk of progression from MCI to AD, and that discriminate between AD, MCI and cognitively normal elders.
