Further details on the study design and recruitment Background and Purpose-Arterial stiffness is a measure of subclinical cardiovascular disease and increases with age. This study examines the association between arterial stiffness and cognitive decline in a cohort of older adults. Methods-A total of 2488 subjects with baseline measure of arterial stiffness (mean age, 74.2 years; 52.3% women) were prospectively followed over 9 years in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study. Arterial stiffness was measured as pulse wave velocity (PWV) and analyzed in tertiles. Cognitive function was assessed using the Modified Mini-Mental State examination at baseline and repeated at years 3, 5, 8, and 10. Lower Modified Mini-Mental State examination scores indicate worse function. We fit linear mixed models to examine longitudinal changes in cognitive function over the 9 years of follow-up and logistic regression models, restricted to 1331 participants, to examine cognitive impairment defined as a decrease of \u22655 points after 9 years.

PWV is regarded as the gold standard measure of arterial stiffness and a more direct measure than pulse pressure. 26, 27 For each participant, 3 runs, each with a minimum of 10 pairs of simultaneous flow waves from the right carotid and right femoral arteries, were recorded and then averaged. The distance between the carotid and femoral arteries was measured above the body surface using a metal tape. 28 The time from the R wave on the ECG to the foot of the pressure wave was also calculated. Both components were then used to calculate PWV as the distance between the carotid and femoral arteries divided by the time differential for the pressure wave to reach both arteries. 28 Our measure of PWV shows an interclass correlation of 0.88 between sonographs and 0.84 between readers. The latter was based on repeated PWV measures from a random sample of 14 participants. 28 Higher PWV (in cm/s) indicates greater stiffness of the vessels.

Levels of lipids, including high-density lipoprotein (mg/dL), low-density lipoprotein (mg/dL), and triglycerides (mg/dL), were measured from fasting blood drawn at baseline.

History of myocardial infarction was ascertained based on self-report of a physician diagnosis or hospitalization. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured twice, then averaged. Hypertension was ascertained as a self-report of a physician diagnosis, use of medication, a systolic blood pressure >140 mm Hg, or a diastolic blood pressure >90 mm Hg. 30 Mean arterial blood pressure was determined from measured systolic and diastolic blood pressures as diastolic pressure +1/3 (systolic pressure-diastolic pressure).

"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Our findings confirm that higher arterial stiffness, as measured by PWV, is associated with faster rates of cognitive decline over 9 years of follow-up and with greater odds of cognitive impairment among community-dwelling older adults, beyond traditional cardiovascular risk factors, such as BMI, type2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and mean arterial blood pressure. Several pathways linking arterial stiffness and cognitive decline have been postulated. First, when arteries undergo stiffness, they often result in damages to pressure pulsatility. The increase in central pulse pressure results in hemodynamic stress in the heart and in high-flow end organs, such as the brain, to which it is transmitted. The high levels of central pulse pressure in the brain result in structural changes and dysfunction to its microcirculation. 9, 11 Second, high pulse pressures may result in structural changes to cerebral blood vessels, which may, in turn, interfere with the transport of important nutrients to the brain and interfere with the clearance of toxic byproducts out of the brain. 37 Third, recent brain imaging studies have increasingly linked arterial stiffness to cerebral microvascular disease and changes in the functioning of the frontal-subcortical regions of the brain, such as white matter hyperintensities, which, in turn, are associated with cognitive impairment. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Finally, arterial stiffness has also been demonstrated as an independent predictor of CVD events and CVD risk factors, [1] [2] [3] [4] which, in turn, are important predictors of cognitive decline.\nOur study findings were consistent with previous studies demonstrating a cross-sectional association between arterial stiffness and cognitive impairment. 3, [16] [17] [18] Importantly, however, only a handful studies documented the longitudinal associations between arterial stiffness and cognitive decline and reported inconsistent conclusions. 8, [19] [20] [21] [22] Our study findings were inconsistent with those among older adults of the Rotterdam study, which did not provide evidence for a prospective association between PWV and cognitive decline, measured across 2 study time points only. 19 Our findings were in accordance with those from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (N=582), which found significant associations between higher PWV and more rapid cognitive decline on the Blessed Information Memory Concentration Test (working memory test). However, results from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging did not provide evidence for an association between PWV and tests of global cognitive function. 8 Previous results from a subsample (N=552) of older adults in Health ABC provided an association between higher PWV and greater cognitive decline on the psychomotor speed only, but not on tests of memory and global cognitive function. 21 Finally, recent findings from the PARTAGE study, among 873 institutionalized patients \u226580 years of age living in France and Italy, showed an association between higher tertile of PWV and greater cognitive decline on the Mini-Mental Status examination over 1-year follow-up only. 22 Further results from our exploratory analyses suggested that higher PWV, suggestive of increased vascular risk, may be more associated with deteriorations in language and visualspatial tasks than in memory or executive function tasks.\nPrevious literature suggests that blacks have greater arterial stiffness, 38 higher prevalence of hypertension 39 , and exhibit lower rates of blood pressure control 40 than non-Hispanic whites. Although previous epidemiological studies, such as the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, included whites and blacks, their small sample size with available PWV measurement (N=582) may have hindered their statistical power to examine any racial/ethnic-related disparity. As an exploratory analysis, we examined whether the association between arterial stiffness and cognitive decline differed for our white (n=1486) and black (n=1002) participants. Although blacks had lower cognitive scores at baseline than whites, the rates of cognitive decline associated with arterial stiffness did not differ by race/ ethnicity (P>0.05). Future studies need to confirm our findings.\nOur study is the first population-based study to examine the association between arterial stiffness and cognitive decline in a large cohort of community-dwelling older adults who underwent >2 repeated cognitive assessments and over a long period of follow-up. Furthermore, our study extends the literature by examining racial/ethnic-related disparity in the longitudinal association of arterial stiffness with cognitive decline, which other studies did not examine, possibly because of lack of statistical power. As such, our study has several strengths, including the large sample size of a biracial community-dwelling cohort of older adult whites and blacks who were well functioning at baseline. Participants in this study were prospectively followed over a long study period with repeated measures of cognitive testing. Finally, PWV is regarded as the gold standard for measuring arterial stiffness and thus provides a great strength to our study. 26, 27 Our study has some limitations that are worth noting. PWV was only measured at baseline, which limited our ability to examine the associations of concurrent changes in PWV and cognitive function over time. Given the longitudinal nature of the study, there was attrition attributable to mortality or other competing risks. Premature mortality, particularly among those with the highest PWV tertile, may have resulted in an attenuation of our results (dropout because of mortality was 37%, 45%, and 49% in participants with low, middle, and high tertile of PWV, respectively). Finally, given that our cohort was well functioning at baseline, potential ceiling effects may have hindered our ability to detect much change in cognitive scores over time."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In this cohort of community-dwelling older adults, we provided evidence of an association between higher arterial stiffness and Cognitive impairment is defined as a decline of 5 or more points.
