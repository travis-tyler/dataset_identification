[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This report presents findings on crime and violence in regular public schools 1 in the United States, using data from the 2003-04 School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS:2004). First administered in the 1999-2000 school year, SSOCS provides information about school crime-related topics from the perspective of school administrators. Developed by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and supported by the Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools, SSOCS asks public school principals about the frequency of criminal incidents in their schools, such as physical attacks, robberies, and thefts. Portions of this survey also focus on school programs, disciplinary actions, and the policies implemented to prevent and reduce crime in schools. SSOCS:2004 is based on a nationally representative stratified random sample of 3,743 U.S. public schools. Questionnaires were mailed to principals on March 1, 2004, and data collection continued through June 4, 2004. A total of 2,772 public primary, middle, high, and combined schools provided useable questionnaires leading to an unweighted response rate of approximately 75 percent. When the responding schools were weighted to account for their original sampling probabilities, the response rate increased to approximately 77 percent. A nonresponse bias analysis was performed because the weighted response weight was less than 85 percent. For more information about the methodology and design of SSOCS, including the results of the nonresponse bias analysis, please see the Methodology and Technical Notes in appendix B of this report. Because the purpose of this report is to introduce new NCES data through the presentation of tables containing descriptive information, only select findings are listed below. These key points have been chosen to demonstrate the range of information available when using SSOCS:2004 data rather than discuss all of the observed differences. The tables in this report contain totals and percentages generated from bivariate crosstabulation procedures. All of the results are weighted. Comparisons drawn in the bullets have been tested for statistical significance at the .05 level using Student's t statistics to ensure that the differences are larger than those that might be expected due to sampling variation. Many of the variables examined are related to one another, and complex interactions and relationships have not been explored. Many substantively minor differences may be statistically significant because of the large sample size. Thus, only differences of 5 percentage points or more between groups are discussed in this report.

High schools were no different than middle schools in the number of violent incidents of crime reported. (table 1) \u2022 High schools (44 percent) were more likely to report that students were distributing illegal drugs at school than were middle schools (27 percent) or primary schools (1 percent). (table 3) \u2022 Middle schools (42 percent) were more likely than high schools (21 percent) and primary schools (24 percent) to report that student bullying occurs at least once a week at school. (table 5) \u2022 Of the disciplinary actions administered for use or possession of a weapon other than a firearm, the percentage of out-of-school suspensions lasting 5 or more days but less than the remainder of the school year (37 percent) was no different than the percentage of other disciplinary actions 3 (36 percent). Both out-of-school suspensions and other disciplinary actions were used more often than were removals with no continuing services for at least the remainder of the school year (5 percent) and transfers to specialized schools (23 percent). (table 6) \u2022 Schools with 1,000 or more students (24 percent) were less likely to have 76-100 percent of students with a parent or guardian who attended an open house or back-toschool night than were schools with fewer than 300 students (48 percent), schools with 300-499 students (49 percent), or schools with 500-999 students (43 percent). (table 7) \u2022 City schools (95 percent) were more likely than rural schools (89 percent) to use student-to-student or adult-to-student methods of violence prevention such as individual attention, mentoring, tutoring, or coaching of students. (table 8) \u2022 The percentage of schools that drilled students on an existing written plan for school shootings (47 percent) was lower than the percentage of schools that drilled students on an existing written plan for natural disasters (84 percent). (table 9) \u2022 Among factors that were reported to limit schools' efforts to reduce crime in a major way, three factors were more likely to be reported than others: a lack of or inadequate alternative placements or programs for disruptive students (24 percent); inadequate funds (22 percent); and federal, state, or district policies on disciplining special education students (16 percent).

It is managed by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Data from this collection can be used to examine the relationship between school characteristics and violent and serious violent crimes in primary schools, middle schools, high schools, and combined schools. In addition, data from SSOCS can be used to assess what crime prevention programs, practices, and policies are used by schools. SSOCS has been conducted in school years 1999-2000 and 2003-04, and a third collection took place in the 2005-06 school year. "}, {"section_title": "Sample Design", "text": "The sampling frame for SSOCS:2004 was constructed from the public school universe file created for the 2003-04 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS). The SASS frame was derived from the 2001-02 Common Core of Data (CCD) Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe Data file. The CCD is an annual national database containing information on all public K-12 schools and school districts. Certain types of schools are excluded from the 2001-02 CCD Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe Data file in order to meet the sampling needs of SASS: those in U.S. outlying areas, 1 overseas Department of Defense schools, newly closed schools, home schools, and schools with high grades of kindergarten or lower. Additional schools are then excluded from the SASS frame to meet the sampling needs of SSOCS: any \"non-regular\" 2 public schools, ungraded schools, domestic Department of Defense schools, Bureau of Indian Affairs schools, schools reporting no students, local education agencies that appear to be schools, and administrative offices that oversee schools in California and Pennsylvania. The objectives of the sampling design in 2003-04 were two-fold: to obtain overall crosssectional and subgroup estimates of important indicators of school crime and safety and to have precise estimates of change in various characteristics relating to crime between the 1999-2000 and 2003-04 SSOCS administrations. To obtain these objectives, a stratified sample of 3,743 regular public schools was drawn for SSOCS:2004. The same general sampling design used for SSOCS:2000 was adopted for the selection of schools B-4 in SSOCS:2004 with regard to the stratification variables, the number of strata, the method of sample allocation, and the sorting of variables before selection. However, there was no attempt to minimize overlap between SSOCS samples and other NCES survey samples in SSOCS:2004, as was done during the 2000 administration. 3 Adopting the same basic design increases the precision of the estimates of change. The initial goal of SSOCS:2004 was to collect data from a sample of 2,550 schools. One possible method of allocating schools would have been to proportionately allocate them to strata. However, while the majority of schools are primary schools, the majority of school violence is reported in middle and high schools. Proportional allocation would have therefore yielded an inefficient sample design. Since it was suspected that primary schools would have less variation in the amount of school violence, a larger proportion of the sample was allocated to middle and high schools. SSOCS:2000 was allocated in a similar manner. The desired sample of 2,550 schools was allocated to the four instructional levels as follows: 640 primary schools, 895 middle schools, 915 high schools; and 100 combined schools. 4 The same variables and categories used to create strata in SSOCS:2000 were used to create strata for SSOCS:2004. The population of schools was stratified (grouped) into four instructional levels, four types of locale settings, and four enrollment size groups. These variables were chosen because they were shown to be highly associated with school crime. The sample of schools in each instructional level was allocated to each of the 16 subgroups formed by the cross-classification of four categories of enrollment size 5 and four types of locale. 6 In order to obtain a reasonable sample of lower-enrollment schools while at the same time giving a higher probability of selection to higherenrollment schools, the sample was allocated to each subgroup in proportion to the sum of the square roots of the total student enrollment in each school in that stratum. The effective sample within each stratum was then inflated to account for nonresponse. Once the final sample sizes were determined for each of the 64 strata, the subgroups were 3 Selecting a sample that avoids any overlap or minimizes overlap would have unnecessarily complicated the sampling design and would have required complex computations of probabilities prior to sample selection, as well as complex weighting post-data collection. Moreover, minimizing overlap leads to changes to the probabilities of selection that would have resulted under a design without the constraint of minimization of overlap. Finally, the number of other NCES surveys in the field during the SSOCS:2004 field period was much lower than it was in the SSOCS:2000 administration, so the likelihood of a sampled SSOCS school being selected for another NCES survey was lower for SSOCS:2004 than it was for SSOCS:2000. 4 The number of combined schools sampled in the SSOCS:2004 study was considerably smaller than in 2000. In SSOCS:2000, an initial sample of 269 combined schools was selected and 199 surveys were completed. Because so few combined schools responded, reliable estimates for these schools could not be produced. It was therefore more efficient to take a smaller sample of combined schools and allocate the balance to the remaining three instructional levels for which separate estimates were required. In 2004, the number of completed surveys for combined schools was initially expected to be about half the number of completed surveys for combined schools in 2000. This logic proved true, as 102 combined schools completed surveys in SSOCS:2004."}, {"section_title": "B-5", "text": "sorted by region and percent minority enrollment, and a systematic sample of 3,743 schools was selected. Sorting by these variables before selection has the same effect as stratification with proportional allocation of schools to the strata."}, {"section_title": "Data Collection", "text": "SSOCS:2004 was conducted as a mail survey with telephone follow-up. Six months before the onset of data collection, NCES began working with the school districts of sample schools that required prior approval to participate in the survey. In late February 2004, advance letters were sent to school administrators of sample schools that included the date of the first questionnaire mailing and a toll-free number to call with any questions. Approximately one week later, SSOCS questionnaires were mailed to administrators with a cover letter describing the importance of the survey and a brochure providing additional information about it. See appendix D for a copy of the questionnaire. On the same day the questionnaires were mailed to schools, letters were sent to sample district superintendents and the Chief State School Officer of each state to inform them that schools within their districts and states, respectively, had been selected to participate in SSOCS:2004. The letters included information about the survey and were accompanied by a copy of the questionnaire and brochure that were sent to schools. The letter was not designed to ask for permission from these officials to participate in the survey but rather was designed by NCES as a vehicle to enhance participation. Starting approximately one week after the first questionnaire mailing, follow-up telephone prompts were used to verify that the questionnaire was received and to encourage survey response. As an alternative to replying by mail, data were also accepted by fax submission and over the telephone. Data collection ended on June 4, 2004. Returned questionnaires were examined for quality and completeness using both manual and computerized edits. A total of 101 items were identified as critical items because it was felt that responses to these items were crucial to the success of the survey. 7 If the survey had more than 40 percent of all items missing or more than 20 percent of critical items missing, the respondent was recontacted to resolve issues related to the missing data, irrespective of whether the item was considered \"critical\" or not. In cases where the recontacts failed to produce a satisfactory resolution, imputation was used to resolve data quality issues for questionnaires that had at least 60 percent of all items and 80 percent of critical items completed. Surveys that did not meet these criteria were considered nonrespondents and are excluded from the analyses in this report."}, {"section_title": "Weighting", "text": "Sample weights allow inferences to be made about the population from which the sample units were drawn. Because of the complex nature of the SSOCS:2004 sample design, these weights are necessary to obtain population-based estimates, to minimize bias arising from differences between responding and nonresponding schools, and to calibrate the data to known population characteristics in a way that reduces sampling error. The procedures used to create the SSOCS sampling weights are described below. An initial (base) weight was first determined within each stratum by calculating the ratio of the number of schools available in the sampling frame to the number of schools selected. The responding schools did not necessarily constitute a random sample from the schools in the stratum because some principals refused to participate. In order to reduce the potential of bias from nonresponse, weighting classes were determined by using a statistical algorithm similar to CHAID (i.e., chi-square automatic interaction detector) to partition the sample such that schools within a weighting class were homogenous with respect to the probability of responding. The predictor variables for the analysis were school level, region, enrollment size, percent minority, student-to-teacher ratio, percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, and number of teachers. When the number of responding schools in a class was small, that weighting class was combined with another class to avoid the possibility of large weights. After combining the necessary classes, the base weights were adjusted so that the weighted distribution of the responding schools resembled the initial distribution of the total sample. The nonresponse-adjusted base sampling weights were then calibrated to agree with known population counts obtained from the sampling frame, to reduce bias in the estimates due to undercoverage. The calibration process, a form of poststratification, separates the sample into a number of classes (poststrata), defined by a crossclassification of variables. The known population counts may be available for the individual cells of the cross-classification or only for certain margins of it. In the latter situation, the calibration proceeds iteratively, one margin at a time, and is often called \"raking.\" Poststratification works well when the noncovered population is similar to the covered population in each poststratum. Thus, to be effective, the variables that define the poststrata must be correlated with the outcome of interest, which is crime for the purpose of this report. They must also be well-measured in the survey, and the control totals must be available for the population as a whole. Similar to SSOCS:2000, these requirements were satisfied by the two margins set up for the raking ratio adjustment of the weights: (1) instructional level and school enrollment size, and (2) instructional level and locale. All three variables have been shown to be correlated with crime (Miller 2004)."}, {"section_title": "Imputation Procedures", "text": "Files containing missing data can be problematic because, depending on how the missing data are treated, analysis of incomplete data sets may cause different users to arrive at different conclusions. Another problem with missing data is that certain groups of respondents may be more likely than others to skip survey items, creating bias in the survey estimates. Imputing the missing data aims to reduce these problems. For this reason, an item-level nonresponse bias analysis was conducted, which is discussed briefly below in the section entitled \"Analysis of Item Nonresponse Bias\" and in detail in section 3.6 and section 3.7 of the School Survey on Crime andSafety: 2003-04 Data File User's Manual (Guerino et al. 2006). Completed SSOCS surveys contained some level of item nonresponse after the conclusion of the data retrieval phase. 8 In SSOCS:2004, imputation procedures were used to create values for all questionnaire items with missing information. This is a deviation from SSOCS:2000, in which only critical items were imputed. This procedural change was implemented because the analysis of incomplete datasets may cause different users to arrive at different conclusions, depending on how the missing data are treated. The imputation methods utilized in SSOCS:2004 were tailored to the nature of the survey item. Four methods were used: aggregate proportions, best-match, logical, and clerical. These methods are described in detail in section 4.4 of the School Survey on Crime andSafety: 2003-04 Data File User's Manual (Guerino et al. 2006). The weighted item response rates for SSOCS:2004 were generally high. After data cleaning and editing, weighted item response rates ranged from 68.2 percent to 100 percent. The median weighted item response rate of the 227 questionnaire items was 99.2 percent, which is relatively high for a mailed self-administered questionnaire. In fact, the majority of items (96 percent) had weighted response rates of over 85 percent. All nine of the survey items with weighted response rates below 85 percent were items that required the respondent to provide a write-in value. For a listing of specific item response rates, please refer to section 4.4 of the School Survey on Crime andSafety: 2003-04 Data File User's Manual (Guerino et al. 2006). Certain groups of respondents may be more likely than others to skip survey items, creating bias in the survey estimates. For this reason, an item-level bias analysis was conducted, which is discussed briefly below in the section entitled \"Analysis of Item Nonresponse Bias.\" It is discussed in detail in section 3.6 and section 3.7 of the School Survey on Crime andSafety: 2003-04 Data File User's Manual (Guerino et al. 2006)."}, {"section_title": "Unit Response Rates", "text": "A unit response rate is, at its most basic level, the ratio of surveys completed with eligible respondents to the total count of eligible respondents. In some surveys, this calculation can be rather complicated because it is difficult to distinguish eligible and ineligible units. For school surveys, however, the Department of Education updates its list of known schools on a fairly regular basis, so estimating eligibility among nonrespondents is relatively straightforward. Unit response rates can be unweighted or weighted, but weighted response rates are traditionally reported because they reflect the potential effects of nonsampling error and whether portions of the population are underrepresented due to nonresponse. In order to calculate any of these measures, it is first necessary to know the disposition (outcome) of each sampled case. Table B-1 shows the dispositions of the 3,743 cases initially selected between responding and nonresponding schools on characteristics related to the estimates of interest. A unit-level nonresponse bias analysis was conducted to evaluate the extent of this bias in SSOCS:2004. Responding and nonresponding schools were compared across the characteristics available for both groups: instructional level, enrollment size, type of locale, percent minority, region, the number of full-time-equivalent (FTE) teachers, student-to-teacher ratio, and percent of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. With the exception of the Northeast and Midwest regions, the differences within the categories were less than 1.0 percentage point, often substantially less. For more information on the analysis of unit nonresponse, please see section 3.6 of the School Survey on Crime andSafety: 2003-04 Data File User's Manual (Guerino et al. 2006)."}, {"section_title": "Item Response Rates", "text": "The unweighted item response rates are calculated by dividing the number of sample schools responding to an item by the number of schools asked to respond to the item. Sometimes, respondents gave answers to items that were inconsistent with latter portions of the questionnaire. These answers were blanked and imputed to maintain consistency. However, these cases were considered respondents when calculating the item-level response rates. Weighted item-level response rates on SSOCS:2004 ranged from 68-100 percent."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Item Nonresponse Bias", "text": "Just as principals chose not to respond to the survey request, they occasionally chose not to answer all of the items on SSOCS. An item-level bias analysis was performed to determine the extent to which such differences occur on SSOCS:2004 because this type of nonresponse can lead to bias in estimates. The magnitude of item nonresponse bias is determined by both the level of item response and the difference between item respondents and item nonrespondents on a survey variable. Because the values of the survey variables are not known for item nonrespondents, distributions of eight sampling frame variables 10 were compared between the respondents to each item and all respondents to the survey (item respondents + item nonrespondents) for the nine items with weighted item response rates less than 85 percent: Q17D1_1 (total number of recorded physical attacks or fights with a weapon), Q17D1_2 (number of physical attacks or fights with a weapon reported to police or other law enforcement), Q17D2_1 (total number of recorded physical attacks or fights without a weapon), Q17D2_2 (number of physical attacks or fights without a weapon reported to police or other law enforcement), Q28A2 (number of part-time special education teachers), Q28B2 (number of part-time special education aides), Q28C2 (number of parttime regular classroom teachers), Q28D2 (number of part-time regular classroom teacher aides or paraprofessionals), and Q28E2 (number of part-time counselors or mental health professionals). For each of the nine items with weighted response rates less than 85 percent, the differences between the proportion of item respondents and all respondents (item respondents + nonrespondents with imputed values) were examined across each category of the eight frame variables. Next, the proportion of item respondents reporting non-zero responses was compared to the proportion of nonrespondents with imputed non-zero responses across each category of the eight sampling frame variables. Finally, the distribution of the responses from true respondents was compared to the distribution of the responses from all respondents (item respondents + nonrespondents with imputed values). Based on the results of these analyses, it was determined that the biases introduced due to item nonresponse were negligible. More detailed information on the analysis of item nonresponse, including the specific comparisons that were significant in the tests outlined above, is available in section 3.7 of the School Survey on Crime andSafety: 2003-04 Data File User's Manual (Guerino et al. 2006)."}, {"section_title": "Sampling Variability", "text": "Estimates derived from a probability sample are subject to sampling error because only a small fraction of the target population will have been surveyed. In surveys with complex sampling designs, such as SSOCS:2004, direct estimates of the sampling errors that assume simple random sampling typically underestimate the variability in the estimates. The estimates outlined in this report were produced using the jackknife replication method. The approximate standard errors for a range of survey estimates can be computed by hand or by using a statistical package such as SAS, Stata, or SUDAAN. For guidance on how to produce survey estimates and their related standard errors using SSOCS data, please see section 2.6 and section 2.7 of the School Survey on Crime andSafety: 2003-04 Data File User's Manual (Guerino et al. 2006)."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Tests", "text": "The tests of significance used in this analysis are based on Students' t statistics. The t statistic between estimates from various subgroups presented in the tables can be computed by using the following formula: where x 1 and x 2 are the estimates to be compared (e.g., the means of sample members in two groups) and SE 1 and SE 2 are their corresponding standard errors. Due to the large sample size, many differences (no matter how substantively minor) are statistically significant. Thus, only differences of 5 percentage points or more between groups are discussed in the report, except when an attribute occurs in less than 20 percent of the population.
