[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Scales with varying degrees of measurement reliability are often used in the context of multistage sampling, where variance exists at multiple levels of analysis (e.g., individual and group). Because methodological guidance on assessing and reporting reliability at multiple levels of analysis is currently lacking, we discuss the importance of examining level-specific reliability. We present a simulation study and an applied example showing different methods for estimating multilevel reliability using multilevel confirmatory factor analysis and provide supporting Mplus program code. We conclude that (a) single-level estimates will not reflect a scale's actual reliability unless reliability is identical at each level of analysis, (b) 2-level alpha and composite reliability (omega) perform relatively well in most settings, (c) estimates of maximal reliability (H) were more biased when estimated using multilevel data than either alpha or omega, and (d) small cluster size can lead to overestimates of reliability at the between level of analysis. We also show that Monte Carlo confidence intervals and Bayesian credible intervals closely reflect the sampling distribution of reliability estimates under most conditions. We discuss the estimation of credible intervals using Mplus and provide R code for computing Monte Carlo confidence intervals."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Reliability has been defined alternatively as the squared correlation between true and observed scores (e.g., Lord & Novick, 1968, p. 61) or as the ratio of a scale's true score variance to its total variance (e.g., McDonald, 1999) . These definitions are mathematically equivalent when the observed score's variance is positive (e.g., de Gruijter & van der Kamp, 2008; Raykov & Marcoulides, 2011) , and both assume access to a scale's true score variance. Because true score variance is unknown and can only be estimated from observed data, most reliability estimates rely on the assumption that observed covariances necessarily represent true score variance.\nReliability estimates are only as trustworthy as the information used to estimate them, however, and estimating reliability from data collected through multistage sampling necessarily confounds within-and between-cluster item variance (i.e., within-group variance and between-group variance). As such, multistage sampling may lead to biased reliability estimates when the assumption of independent residuals is violated (e.g., Snijders & Bosker, 1999) .\nMultistage sampling occurs when cases are randomly sampled from higher order units that are themselves sampled from a larger population of such units. For example, an education researcher might recruit several schools, select a sample of classrooms from each school, then obtain samples of students from each classroom (e.g., Connor et al., 2010) . Multistage sampling results in hierarchically structured data (e.g., students nested within classrooms), making residuals dependent in the presence of between-cluster variation. Scores on key variables from children in a given classroom might be more alike than those of children in different classrooms, for instance. Ignoring hierarchical data structures can bias estimates of interitem relationships, likewise biasing reliability estimation for a desired level of analysis. Single-level reliability estimates therefore do not necessarily reflect true scale reliability at any single level of analysis.\nThe need to account for multilevel variability has been firmly established for hypothesis testing but has been largely ignored in the context of estimating a scale's reliability. It is commonly seen that researchers who appropriately use multilevel analysis to test primary hypotheses nevertheless report Cronbach's \u2423 as evidence for acceptable levels of scale reliability, even though doing so implicitly assumes a single-level factor structure. This unfortunate status quo is not the fault of researchers, however, as extant methods for estimating reliability focus on a scale's total variability rather than the reliability of a scale at multiple levels of analysis (e.g., Cronbach, 1951; McDonald, 1999) .\nTo give researchers a conceptual and operational foundation for understanding reliability at multiple levels of analysis, in the present article we describe how multilevel confirmatory factor analysis (MCFA) can be used to separately estimate reliability within and between clusters of a multilevel model. Whereas our logic can apply to any number of levels, we constrain our discussion to two-level models to facilitate presentation.\nWe first discuss common single-level reliability estimates and describe how each can be estimated within a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) framework. We then address the dangers of misapplying popular single-level techniques to multilevel data and introduce MCFA as the natural solution to this problem. We explore the applicability of MCFA for multilevel reliability estimation using simulated data and provide an applied example, focusing on the implications of multilevel reliability estimation for applied researchers. We also provide example code in an appendix in the online supplemental materials to facilitate implementation of the methods we describe."}, {"section_title": "Single-Level Reliability Estimation Using Structural Equation Modeling", "text": "While CFA and structural equation modeling (SEM) estimate construct relations without measurement error when multiple indicators are used for each construct, researchers who use these methods may still wish to estimate reliability for their scales for multiple reasons. First, reliability estimates summarize the factor loading matrix into a single, easily interpretable quantity (given a known number of items) and can help future researchers choose among scales that tap the same construct with better or worse measurement characteristics. Such information may therefore be especially important to provide when discussing the creation and validation of a new scale. Second, providing reliability estimates across many samples can help inform the generalizability of itemlevel relations (from previous or future research) to their respective latent relations. In the following sections, we begin by discussing how researchers can estimate various reliability coefficients in the framework of CFA and SEM. The list of reliability estimates discussed below is by no means exhaustive, and we readily acknowledge that all estimates carry multiple pros and cons. As such, we constrain our discussion to three of the more commonly utilized reliability estimates: \u2423, , and H."}, {"section_title": "Alpha", "text": "Traditional methods of reliability estimation rely on the general linear model (GLM) and are easily implemented in GLM-based frameworks such as SEM and CFA. For example, Cronbach's Equation 16 for computing \u2423 (Cronbach, 1951 ; see also Guttman, 1945; Kuder & Richardson, 1937) specifies \u2423 as a function of the average interitem covariance within a scale ( ij ), the variance of the scale score ( X 2 ), and the number of items included in the scale (n):\nAlpha can be estimated with CFA-capable software by specifying a fully saturated covariance structure model that has no latent variables. The average covariance is found by summing all unique covariances in matrix \u233a (the symmetric matrix of indicator variances, ii 2 , and covariances, ij ) and dividing the sum by the number of unique covariances. The variance of the scale score can then be computed by summing all item variances and two times each unique covariance in \u233a (the variance of a sum is equal to the sum of the full [i.e., square] covariance matrix of all elements):\nWhile it has long been known that \u2423 is in most cases an inconsistent estimator of reliability (e.g., Novick & Lewis, 1967) , \u2423 is by far the most common reliability estimate used in psychological research. The ubiquity of \u2423, as well as the relatively minor difference between \u2423 and alternative reliability estimates in applied research (see Footnote 7 below), make alpha an important statistic to consider when examining issues related to scale reliability. We therefore retain \u2423 in the present article to make the results of our simulation applicable to a broad audience, for whom the rough approximation provided by \u2423 is generally sufficient."}, {"section_title": "Composite Reliability", "text": "The average interitem covariance provides a limited estimate of a scale's true score variance, as evidenced by the fact that \u2423 is a consistent estimate of reliability only when all items load on a single underlying construct and when all items represent that construct equally well (i.e., essential tau equivalence; see Novick & Lewis, 1967) . CFA allows for heterogeneous correlations between indicators and their underlying common factor(s) (i.e., heterogeneous factor loadings), and composite reliability () as calculated from factor loadings produces more precise estimates of reliability than those provided by \u2423.\nComposite reliability has been discussed by several authors (e.g., Bentler, 2007; McDonald, 1970 McDonald, , 1999 Raykov, 1997; Werts, Linn, & J\u00f6reskog, 1974) and is conceptually similar to \u2423 in that it represents the ratio of a scale's estimated true score variance relative to its total variance. Unlike \u2423, however, acknowledges the possibility of heterogeneous item-construct relations and estimates true score variance as a function of item factor loadings ( i ) in matrix \u2333. Assuming a congeneric scale with a standardized latent construct (i.e., with variance fixed to 1), can be estimated as\nwhere i represents the factor loading of item i onto a single common factor and ii represents the unique variance of item i. The numerator in is identical to 1=\u2333\u2333=1, the sum of the full (i.e., square) model-implied covariance matrix of item true scores, 2 whereas the denominator represents the true score variance plus all residual variances. Under essential tau equivalence, Equations 1 and 3 become mathematically identical when the factor model used to estimate fits the data perfectly. That is, \u2423 may be thought of as a special case of under essential tau equivalence. The true score covariance matrix contains n 2 elements that all equal the average interitem covariance, and the denominators of both equations simply represent the sum of all sources of scale score variance.\nSeveral variations of composite reliability exist in the literature, most of which reduce to Equation 3 for congeneric scales (e.g., Bentler, 2007; McDonald, 1999; Raykov & Shrout, 2002; Zinbarg et al., 2005) . We therefore limit the present discussion to congeneric measures for parsimony."}, {"section_title": "Maximal Reliability", "text": "Composite reliability represents the relation between a scale's underlying latent factor and its unit-weighted composite, but a scale's unit-weighted composite may not optimally reflect its underlying latent construct. The true score variance estimated in factor analysis allows for heterogeneous indicator weights, and it is reasonable to allow similarly heterogeneous weights when creating a scale's composite score. One alternative to comparing true score variance to the variance of a unit-weighted scale is presented as maximal reliability (H; e.g., Bentler, 2007; Conger, 1980; Hancock & Mueller, 2001; Li, 1997; Raykov, 2004 ; see also Thomson, 1940) , which represents the reliability of a scale's optimally weighted composite:\nwhere \u1409 j 2 represents the squared standardized factor loading of indicator i onto a single common factor, which is identical to the reliability of indicator i (assuming a correctly specified singlefactor model). Hancock and Mueller (2001) showed that this formula reduces to\nBecause H optimally weights indicators and squares individual factor loadings, Hancock and Mueller (2001) noted that it has several properties not shared by composite reliability. First, whereas composite reliability is negatively influenced by negative factor loadings (i.e., the numerator sums all factor loadings before squaring the term), the squared loadings used in H allow negatively valenced indicators to contribute meaningful variance to the estimated true score. Second, because H optimally weights indicators when computing the composite score, H will never be less than the reliability (i.e., squared standardized loading) of the best indicator. Similarly, the addition of weakly loading indicators can reduce estimates of composite reliability but will not reduce H because weak indicators will receive very low weights when computing an optimally weighted composite. H therefore considers weak indicators at least somewhat informative, and their inclusion in a scale should not reduce the reliability of an optimally weighted composite. This weighting also means, however, that H does not estimate the same population parameter as or \u2423.\nThe coefficients \u2423, , and H therefore provide point estimates of a scale's reliability (although H represents the reliability of optimally weighted composite). While point estimates are often informative, it is also important to consider their sampling distributions as our confidence in a point estimate will vary across differing data conditions. The delta-method standard error (i.e., the standard deviation of a parameter estimate's sampling distribution under the assumption of asymptotic normality) has been shown to provide an unbiased estimate of 's population standard deviation (Raykov, 2002) , but the distribution of (and other reliability estimates) likely is not symmetric (e.g., Kristner & Muller, 2004 , discussed the exact distribution of \u2423 and provided an approximation using the F distribution). Standard errors may therefore be less informative than empirically derived confidence intervals. For instance, empirically derived confidence intervals would allow researchers to test whether their scale's reliability is significantly greater than a lower threshold such as .80. Raykov (1998) argued that confidence intervals for can be obtained through bootstrapping (e.g., Efron & Tibshirani, 1993) , and the same logic can also be applied to estimating confidence intervals for \u2423 and H."}, {"section_title": "Multilevel Reliability", "text": "A significant body of research has focused on reliability estimation for multilevel models, but research has primarily focused on how reliably group means of a dependent variable represent the larger distribution of group means in a population (e.g., Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002 ; see also Raykov & Marcoulides, 2006; Raykov & Penev, 2010) . While informative for multilevel models in general, the reliability of group means as estimates of the distribution of group means in a population is different than measurement reliability as we have discussed it above.\nOf greater present interest is the estimation of a scale's reliability under two-stage random sampling (i.e., multilevel data). Approached from a multilevel perspective, two-stage sampling leads to observed scores (y ik ) that contain both true score and measurement error variance at both the within-cluster and between-cluster levels (denoted by i and k subscripts, respectively). Thus, an MCFA approach to multilevel data allows researchers not only to model data for which a scale represents the same construct at each level, but also to model data for which only a between-cluster construct is meaningful (e.g., Chan, 1998; Kozlowski & Klein, 2000) or for which only within-level heterogeneity is meaningful (e.g., Fitzmaurice, Laird, & Ware, 2011; Halaby, 2004; Woolridge, 2002) . Further, MCFA allows for qualitatively different constructs at each level such that a single scale may contain items that possess different factor structures within versus between clusters. Whereas the concept of separate level-specific true scores and measurement errors at each level runs contrary to the tenets of classical test theory (e.g., that there is only one measurement error), we note that multilevel models represent a superordinate class of models that include those derived from generalizability theory (see Goldstein & McDonald, 1988 , for a brief discussion). While issues concerning reliability are more appropriately discussed in terms of classical test theory, generalizability theory specifies that a scale's total variance can be decomposed into multiple orthogonal facets (e.g., Shavelson & Webb, 2004; Webb, Rowley, & Shavelson, 1988) , similar to the decomposition that occurs under the MCFA model. A generalizability theory-derived model may, for instance, decompose a scale's variance into the variance of person-specific deviations from a grand mean (i.e., a universe score), item-specific variance, between-cluster differences, the interactions among these three sources, as well as variance due to nonsystematic error. Here, nonsystematic variation and variance due to the three-way interaction between persons, items, and clusters are not distinguishable, so these effects would be aggregated into a single residual term. Using such a decomposition, researchers can calculate generalizability coefficients that treat different combinations of these sources of variance as representing target variance versus error. Generalizability coefficients are therefore akin to the reliability estimates discussed in classical test theory.\nThe MCFA model assumes a similar kind of decomposition. The MCFA model decomposes observed information in an item into components related to each individual's cluster-average true score (T bk ), which characterizes all individuals within cluster k, as well as each individual's true deviation from the cluster-average true score (T wi ). Furthermore, the difference between an individual's within-cluster deviation from the cluster average and that individual's T wi is a within-cluster error (E wi \u03ed y ik \u03ea y .k \u03ea T wi ). The difference between a cluster's deviation from the grand mean of all true scores and that cluster's T bk is a between-cluster error (E bk \u03ed y .k \u03ea T bk ). Thus, we may represent an individual's observed score as the sum of four parts: Table 1 clarifies how each of these elements aligns with the variance components that would exist in a parallel model derived from generalizability theory. The assumption of distinct withinand between-cluster true scores suggests that true score variance can be captured to a different degree at each level, motivating the need for separate reliability estimates at each level. Reliability at the within level represents the ratio of the within-cluster true score variance to total within-cluster variance (var(T wi )/var(T wi \u03e9 E wi )), whereas reliability at the between level represents the ratio of the between-cluster true score variance to total between-cluster variance (var(T bk )/var(T bk \u03e9 E bk )). Between-cluster reliability therefore reflects the reliability of the between-cluster information in a scale and does not necessarily represent the reliability of grouplevel composites.\nBetween-cluster reliability is therefore distinct from an intraclass correlation (ICC), which represents the ratio of a scale score's between-cluster variance relative to its total variability across both levels. Between-cluster reliability instead reflects the degree to which group-level differences in a researcher's observed data can be generalized to represent between-group differences in a construct of interest.\nTo the extent that group-level reliability estimates are applicable across studies, estimates of between-group reliability in one study help inform the validity of group-level inferences based on previous or future studies. It may therefore be especially important to estimate multilevel reliability estimates when constructing new scales to show that a new scale reliably captures true score variation at each possible level of analysis. Providing such estimates will therefore allow researchers to make better informed choices between measurement instruments, especially in the context of multilevel hypotheses. An MCFA approach to estimating level-specific reliability is especially important to researchers dedicated, for one reason or another, to the multilevel analysis of scale composites. For instance, a multilevel SEM might not be estimable with small unit-level sample sizes, but multilevel regression with scale scores would be. Although not as ideal as fitting a full multilevel SEM (MSEM) model to all scales in a battery simultaneously, separate MCFA models for each scale in such a study could be used to estimate multilevel reliability for each scale individually. This MCFA approach would be greatly preferable to the currently available options of either (a) not reporting reliability and hoping for the best or (b) assuming a single-level design and computing a single-level reliability estimate. Ignoring the fact that separate reliabilities may exist at each level of analysis by computing single-level reliability conflates within-and between-cluster reliability, and it can be shown that single-level reliability is a simple mathematical function of a scale's ICC and its reliability at each level of analysis (see Appendix A in the online supplemental materials). Raykov and du Toit (2005) provided one means for estimating composite reliability in multilevel CFA that accounts for variability both within and between groups, but their procedure provided only a single estimate of reliability that does not differentiate reliability within groups from reliability between groups. A single estimate of composite reliability provides information about the overall reliability of a scale but does not inform whether the scale is sufficiently reliable for use at a specific level of analysis. Cranford and colleagues (2006) also addressed the issue of multilevel reliability, suggesting a method that indeed produces separate level-specific reliability estimates. Their method conflates within-and between-cluster error variance, however, and is not as generalizable as a method that acknowledges separate true score and error variances at each level. Instead, MCFA allows separate estimation of level-specific measurement model parameters and thus allows for level-specific reliability estimation. The general CFA framework allows estimation of \u2423, , and H, as well as other reliability estimates we do not discuss. We next describe how each can be extended to a two-level context."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A Multilevel CFA Approach", "text": "The extension of CFA to accommodate two-level data allows separate estimation and analysis of within-and between-cluster covariance matrices. As discussed above, CFA is optimal for estimating reliability in single-level data, and an MCFA extension to reliability estimation is relatively straightforward (see also Raykov & du Toit, 2005) . 4 In the remainder of this article, we discuss the estimation of \u2423, , and H in an MCFA framework.\nThere are several approaches in the methodological literature for conducting MCFA (e.g., Muth\u00e9n, 1990 Muth\u00e9n, , 1994 . Here, we adopt a method recently developed by Muth\u00e9n and Asparouhov (2009, 2011) for conducting MSEM. MCFA is a special case of MSEM with no structural paths linking latent variables, in much the same way that single-level CFA is a special case of SEM.\nBriefly, the MCFA model is given as a special case of Muth\u00e9n and Asparouhov's (2009) model by a set of three equations (retaining their notation):\nwhere i and k index cases (Level 1 units) and clusters (Level 2 units), respectively. Y ik is a vector of p measured variables;\nfactor loading matrix linking Y ik to p latent parts at both the within-and between-cluster levels and m common factors at both levels; ik is a vector of length (2p \u03e9 2m) containing p latent within-cluster parts, m within-cluster common factors, p latent between-cluster parts, and m between-cluster common factors 5 ; \u2423 k is a vector of length (2p \u03e9 2m) that contains the p item intercepts and m between-cluster common factors; B k is a (2p \u03e9 2m) \u03eb (2p \u03e9 2m) matrix containing within-cluster factor loadings; k (r \u03eb 1) contains all of the k-subscripted random coefficients from \u2423 k and B k , including the between-cluster common factors; (r \u03eb 1) contains means of those coefficients and the item intercepts (if desired); \u2424 (r \u03eb r) contains between-cluster factor loadings; ik contains unique factors and common factor residuals for the within-cluster model; and k (r \u03eb 1) contains unique factors and common factor residuals for the between-cluster model. Finally, ik \u03f3 MVN(0, \u233f W ), and k \u03f3 MVN(0, \u233f B ). A fully specified path diagram is included in Appendix B in the online supplemental materials (for the case in which the item intercepts j \u03ed 0).\nWhereas the basic MCFA model can be elaborated in various ways, we restrict our focus to factor models with no covariates, only continuous items, and no latent regressions (apart from paths among latent variables and their indicators that are better conceptualized as loadings than as regression weights). Furthermore, we consider only the case in which item intercepts are omitted, factor loadings do not vary randomly at the cluster level (B k \u03ed B), and the configural factor structure is identical across levels. These simplifications yield constrained versions of Equations 7 and 8:\nAppendix B in the online supplemental materials presents an example model with full expansion of all matrices.\nMultilevel alpha. As discussed above, \u2423, , and H can be directly estimated from CFA model parameters, suggesting a simple extension to two-level CFA. Separate within-and betweencluster \u2423 can be obtained by specifying fully saturated indicator covariance matrices in both levels of an MCFA and separately applying Equation 1 to the within-and between-cluster results. The numerator of each level-specific \u2423 is therefore the squared number of indicators present at a given level of analysis multiplied by the average covariance at that same level. The denominator of each level-specific \u2423 similarly represents the sum of all elements in the full (i.e., square) level-specific covariance matrix and can be obtained by summing all level-specific indicator variances and two times each unique level-specific covariance.\nMultilevel composite reliability. Extending to MCFA requires specification of a unidimensional factor structure at both the within-and between-cluster levels. Equation 3 is then applied to the level-specific parameter estimates, making within-level a function of within-level factor loadings and residual variances whereas between-cluster is a function of the between-cluster factor loadings and residual variances. This approach therefore requires that residual variances be estimated at both levels instead of fixing Level 2 residual variances to zero, as is sometimes done (e.g., Gottfredson, Panter, Daye, Allen, & Wightman, 2009 ). Fixing Level 2 residual variances to zero assumes perfect Level 2 reliability, rendering Level 2 reliability estimation unnecessary.\nWhile beyond the scope of the present article, we note that unless a researcher has strong reasons to suspect an item is perfectly reliable at the between level, he or she should avoid fixing Level 2 residual variances to zero. Estimated residual variances may be close to zero when an item's ICC is small, but near-zero residual variances can still represent a substantial proportion of an indicator's between-cluster variability (e.g., 10%) if the corresponding Level 2 true score variance is also near zero. For example, the population model discussed by Hox, van de Schoot, and Matthijsse (2012; see also Meuleman & Billiet, 2009 ) specifies between-cluster factor loadings of .265 and .280 for a betweencluster latent construct that has been standardized to have unit latent variance. The respective item ICCs are relatively low (i.e., .080) such that the residual variances of these two indicators are close to zero (.015 and .008, respectively). Despite being very small, these residual variances correspond to approximately 19% and 10% of the total between-cluster item variances. In this case, assuming perfect between-cluster item reliability (i.e., fixing residuals to zero) would not be justifiable.\nMultilevel maximal reliability. The same model used to estimate level-specific can also be used to estimate level-specific H. H requires estimates of each item's reliability, as provided by squared standardized factor loadings (represented in Equations 4 and 5 as \u1409 i 2 ). Standardized factor loadings are not generally provided by MCFA software, and a simple generalization allows H to be estimated from raw-metric parameter estimates:\nComputation of level-specific reliability is straightforward from an MCFA perspective, but the applicability of this method remains untested. Next, we present a simulation that explores the use of multilevel \u2423, , and H and shows how these measures capture level-specific reliability under several conditions. We additionally calculate single-level estimates of \u2423, , and H to show the potential implications of ignoring nested data structures when computing reliability.\nConfidence intervals and credible intervals. Following Raykov's (1998) logic, we note that confidence intervals for levelspecific reliability should be obtainable via bootstrapping or similar procedures. Direct nonparametric bootstrapping (i.e., iteratively resampling from an empirical data set to derive an empirically based estimate of a parameter's sampling distribution) can produce biased estimates when applied to multilevel data, however, and parametric alternatives are preferable when one is willing to accept all model assumptions (Goldstein, 2011) . We therefore examine two approaches to estimating the sampling distribution of our level-specific reliability estimates: Monte Carlo confidence intervals and Bayesian credible intervals. As we explain below, Monte Carlo confidence intervals are derived by generating random draws from a parameter vector's hypothesized joint distribution and computing functions of these parameters on each draw. Bayesian credible intervals are similarly derived from a parameter vector's posterior distribution rather than being computed directly from resampled data.\nMonte Carlo confidence intervals. Monte Carlo confidence limits are derived by relying on the sampling distribution of parameter estimates (e.g., factor loadings and residual variances), generating random draws for each parameter, and computing a statistic of interest (e.g., a reliability estimate) from the generated parameters. This is different from a parametric bootstrap approach, where data sets are generated from a model and statistics are computed for each data set separately. An elaboration of the differences between Monte Carlo and parametric bootstrap methods is beyond the scope of the present article; we refer readers to Preacher and Selig (2012) for a discussion of this topic.\nWe obtained Monte Carlo confidence intervals by drawing a random sample of 10,000 parameter estimates from an estimated sampling distribution of these estimates, where observed parameter estimates were used as distribution means and the asymptotic covariance matrix of these estimates was used to represent their population covariance matrix. While Monte Carlo confidence intervals may be accurate with substantially fewer than 10,000 random draws (e.g., MacKinnon, Lockwood, & Williams, 2004 , suggested 1,000 draws), the computational intensity of this approach is small. Because of this, we chose 10,000 draws as an arbitrarily large number that will provide a precise estimate of our target parameters' expected sampling distributions while costing little in terms of computational power and time.\nGiven these population parameters and a set of distributional assumptions (i.e., that all parameters were multivariate normally distributed), we drew observations from the joint distribution of parameter estimates and computed reliability estimates using each sample of parameter estimates. We provide R syntax for computing Monte Carlo confidence intervals for level-specific reliability estimates, given a set of MCFA factor loadings and residual variances and their corresponding asymptotic covariance matrix. Our syntax can be found in Appendix C in the online supplemental materials.\nBayesian credible intervals. Bayesian credible intervals are the range of parameter values that best describe a set of data with a fixed level of probability, given a set of priors. Thus a 95% credible interval for parameter indicates the range of values that has a 95% probability of falling between, given observed data and priors. While this definition differs from the frequentist concept of a confidence interval, credible intervals with noninformative priors approximate asymmetric nonparametric bootstrap confidence intervals (see DiCiccio & Efron, 1996, p. 211) . Raykov (1998, e.g.) has shown that nonparametric bootstrapping can produce unbiased estimates of a reliability estimate's sampling distribution, but resampling-based confidence intervals are not appropriate for multilevel data (Goldstein, 2011) , and bootstrapping generally is problematic in cases involving computational difficulties where a Bayesian approach with Markov chain Monte Carlo can work well (Efron, 2011) . Because credible intervals are computed as a function of posterior distributions rather than from direct resampling, we expect close agreement between Bayesian credible intervals (calculated using the ESTIMATOR \u03ed BAYES option in Mplus) and the corresponding quantiles of a parameter's sampling distribution."}, {"section_title": "Hypotheses", "text": "Given the above discussion, we can make hypotheses regarding the performance of single-and multilevel reliability estimates when data adhere to a multilevel structure. First, ignoring nested data structures will render single-level reliability estimates difficult to interpret when reliability is not identical across levels. Single-level reliability necessarily averages across levels of measurement (see also Appendix A in the online supplemental materials), so we anticipate that single-level reliability estimates will more closely reflect within-level reliability as the proportion of the scale's variance shifts toward the within level (i.e., as ICC becomes smaller) and will more closely reflect between-cluster reliability as the proportion of the scale's variance shifts toward the between level (i.e., as ICC becomes larger; Hypothesis 1A). When reliability does not differ across levels, however, single-level reliability should simply represent the weighted average of two identical values. We hypothesize that when the level-specific reliabilities do not differ across levels, single-level reliability estimates will be unbiased with respect to actual level-specific reliability at either level (Hypothesis 1B).\nSecond, we can make specific hypotheses about the relative performance of individual reliability estimates, including bias, model convergence rates, and confidence interval coverage. As for performance of the individual measures, factor analysis can fail to reproduce an underlying factor structure when item reliabilities are low, especially when sample size is also low (e.g., MacCallum, Widaman, Preacher, & Hong, 2001; MacCallum, Widaman, Zhang, & Hong, 1999) . We will calculate reliability estimates using either a saturated model (\u2423) or by fitting the data-generating model ( and H) and anticipate generally low levels of bias for two-level reliability estimates. In line with previous research (e.g., Muth\u00e9n, Kaplan, & Hollis, 1987) , we consider absolute percent bias \u03fd 10 to represent an acceptable level of bias. We do, however, anticipate increased bias when level-specific sample size or reliability is low (Hypothesis 2).\nThird, differs from \u2423 only by relaxing the assumption of essential tau equivalence. Estimates of and \u2423 consequently are very similar under moderate violations of essential tau equivalence, 6 and despite the widely acknowledged limitations of \u2423 (e.g., Sijtsma, 2009), we anticipate that the two estimates will perform similarly (Hypothesis 3A). H differs from both \u2423 and by representing the reliability of an optimally weighted scale score rather than the reliability of a unitweighted composite. We therefore anticipate that H will be influenced by different factors than \u2423 and (Hypothesis 3B).\nFourth, we will consider convergence rates for each model. We estimate our level-specific \u2423s using a fully saturated two-level model and anticipate few if any convergence problems (Hypothesis 4A). Unlike \u2423, and H are calculated by specifying a single-factor model at both levels, and model convergence is not guaranteed. We anticipate that the two-level CFA models needed to estimate two-level and H will converge in the overwhelming majority of trials when sample size is sufficiently large at both levels. Common rules of thumb suggest that SEM models generally require more than 100 or 150 observations (e.g., Brown, 2006 ), which we apply as a sufficiently large sample size at the within level. Meuleman and Billiet (2009) suggested that 40 between-cluster observations may be sufficient for simple models but that 60 or even 100 groups may be required to achieve sufficient power to detect small interconstruct relations at the between-cluster level. We anticipate reduced convergence rates when overall sample size is small, especially when the between-cluster sample size is small (i.e., 50) or the overall sample size is small due to having dyadic data and few (50 or 100) betweencluster groups (Hypothesis 4B), or when item reliabilities are low at either level (Hypothesis 4C).\nOur final hypotheses concern the Monte Carlo confidence limits and Bayesian credible intervals discussed above. Under the assumption of multivariate normality (which our simulations also assume), we anticipate that Monte Carlo confidence limits generated by our R code (see Appendix C in the online supplemental materials) will closely correspond to empirically derived confidence limits based on the sampling distribution of level-specific reliability estimates. In other words, we anticipate that 95% confidence limits generated using our calculator should provide unbiased estimates of the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the reliability estimates' actual sampling distributions (Hypothesis 5). Further, we also anticipate that 95% credible intervals estimated using Bayesian analysis will similarly provide unbiased estimates of the actual 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the reliability estimates' sampling distributions (Hypothesis 6)."}, {"section_title": "Simulation", "text": "Our simulation considers calculations of single-level and multilevel \u2423, , and H under conditions when data originate from a known multilevel structure. We examine reliability for a congeneric six-item scale with conditions varying the number of Level 1 units, the number of Level 2 units, the average item ICC, and the level(s) of analysis at which the indicators show high reliability (henceforth, the reliability condition; see Table 2 ). We generated 1,000 replications for each condition and analyzed our data using robust maximum likelihood estimation in Mplus. We chose 1,000 replications as an arbitrary balance between generating a large enough number of replications to obtain appropriate precision of our estimates and the time required to analyze our models. We also chose 1,000 replications per cell because this number has been used in previous simulation studies (e.g., Forero, MaydeuOlivares, & Gallardo-Pujol, 2009).\nFor each condition, we separately calculated the percent bias 7 of single-level \u2423, , and H relative to the actual level of each at the within and between levels; percent bias for the estimates of withinand between-cluster \u2423, , and H; and convergence rates for our two-level models. We then conducted analyses of variance (ANOVAs) to determine which conditions most strongly influenced each estimate and convergence rate. We implemented a tear-down approach to decide which predictors were retained in the final models, retaining predictors and interactions only if they explained at least 5% of the dependent variable's variance (i.e., removing the predictor or interaction caused a decrease in 2 greater than or equal to .05). We chose a 5% change in 2 as an arbitrary value that balances the need to detect small but important interactions with our desire to avoid interpreting statistically significant interactions that would nevertheless have little bearing on applied applications of the above reliability estimates. In line with previous research (e.g., Muth\u00e9n et al., 1987) , we also consider absolute percent bias \u03fd 10% to represent an acceptable level of bias.\nTo test our expectation that Monte Carlo confidence intervals will closely reflect the distribution of reliability estimates across repeated sampling, we also obtained 95% confidence limits for several conditions using the R code provided in Appendix C in the online supple-mental materials. We then compared these limits to the empirical distribution of reliability estimates obtained from our simulation. These conditions involved either a low or high ICC (i.e., .05 vs. .50, respectively), varied the total number of observations (either 200 clusters with 30 observations each or 100 clusters with two observations each), and examined conditions where reliability was high at both levels, neither level, only within, or only between. We selected these specific cases to present readers with a general sense of how Monte Carlo confidence intervals behave in relatively extreme cases (i.e., high vs. low ICCs, large vs. small samples) without providing an unwieldy amount of information.

All items strongly reflect the between-cluster factor, although this result says little about the between-cluster factor's validity. In this instance, any single indicator modeled at the between level would be as informative as a between-cluster latent construct. In such a circumstance, a researcher could justifiably simplify the betweencluster model by considering only a single indicator.\nThe between level estimates further highlight the importance of the single strongest factor loading when calculating H, which in this example had a standardized loading very close to 1.00. In other words, this example underscores the point that esti- mates of H will be high as long as there is at least one strong factor loading, regardless of whether or not H is high or low in the population."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The consequences of ignoring a data set's hierarchical structure have been thoroughly explored in the hypothesis-testing literature, but the need to account for clustering when estimating reliability has been largely ignored. In this article, we have extended three common reliability estimates to a multilevel framework using MCFA, advocating the estimation of levelspecific reliability when dealing with multilevel data. Our simulations show that within-level reliability estimates are generally unbiased although positive bias can arise for when within-level reliability is low and there are relatively few, small clusters. Between-cluster reliability estimates were also unbiased under most data conditions, but displayed positive bias when item ICCs were low, especially when the between-cluster reliability was also low and when there were few observations per cluster. Between-cluster \u2423 behaved similarly but displayed negative bias when within-level reliability was low for dyadic data. These results generally support our argument for computing level-specific reliability when researchers are faced with multilevel data. We can draw two additional conclusions from our results. First, between-cluster maximal reliability was biased in nearly every condition characterized by low reliability at the between level. Maximal reliability is bounded by the reliability of the strongest indicator and may be unduly biased when even a single factor loading is overestimated. Given the propensity for H to overestimate its population value at the between level, we cannot recommend its use in empirical multilevel research.\nA second theme in our results was the tendency to see bias at the between level, as well as convergence difficulties, for conditions with few observations per cluster, low ICCs, and low reliability at the between level. Although this result can be partially supported by the simple fact that there was limited information at the between level under these conditions, it is also possible that these results represent the larger problem of dealing with negative ICCs in the multilevel modeling framework. Multilevel models, including MCFA and MSEM, necessarily constrain ICCs to positive values, as evidenced by the fact that ICC is often taken as the proportion of between-cluster variance in an item, relative to its total variance in a sample. ICC can alternatively (and more accurately) be discussed as the expected correlation between pairs of Level 1 units sampled from a given cluster, however, making it possible to have negative ICCs (termed negative nonindependence; Kenny, Mannetti, Pierro, Livi, & Kashy, 2002) . Random samples drawn from populations in which the between-cluster covariance matrix is nearly nonpositive definite, as would occur when few observations per cluster represent between-cluster data with low ICCs and low reliabilities, would be especially prone to containing negative expected covariances between same-cluster pairs. The result would be a negative ICC, leading to either model misfit or nonconvergence. Further investigation is needed, however, to confirm whether this possibility indeed induced bias or model nonconvergence in our simulation."}, {"section_title": "Suggestions for Researchers", "text": "The above discussion indicates that level-specific reliability estimates (i.e., \u2423 and ) are generally preferable to single-level estimates whenever ICCs are nontrivial (i.e., \u0546.05). Withinlevel estimates may be untrustworthy when clusters are small, however, especially in instances of dyadic data. Under dyadic data conditions, our results suggest that within-level \u2423 is preferable to within-level , despite the fact that \u2423 is an inconsistent estimator of reliability in the population. Due to the inconsistency of \u2423, our results suggest that within-level is preferred in all other data conditions.\nThe issue of small clusters is especially relevant to researchers who examine repeated-measures data using a multilevel modeling framework and when there are very few observations per individual (i.e., few Level 1 units). 10 We can anticipate from our simulation that within-level reliability estimates should be relatively unbiased under such conditions, but Level 2 reliability estimates cannot be trusted when ICCs are low. Despite this obvious limitation, we recommend a multilevel approach to estimating reliability over alternative methods when dealing with a small number of Level 1 units. Two common alternatives would be to either (a) report reliability for each wave separately while ignoring the nested structure of the data set or (b) take a fixed-effects approach that only corrects standard errors (e.g., using the Huber-White correction). These alternatives necessarily conflate reliability across levels and will be biased to the extent that scale reliability differs across levels and the item ICCs are greater than zero.\nSimilarly, between-cluster is preferable to between-cluster \u2423 under most data conditions, although we suggest between-cluster \u2423 for data with small ICCs and smaller clusters (i.e., 15 or fewer observations per cluster). Due to model convergence rates, between-cluster \u2423 may also serve as a generally acceptable fallback for instances in which a two-level CFA fails to converge. Last, our Monte Carlo confidence limit calculator produced unbiased limits when reliability was high but biased limits when reliability was low. Until more work is done to determine why our confidence intervals tended to be biased under certain conditions, we can recommend our calculator for computing confidence intervals only when estimated reliability is greater than .60, as this value fell roughly at (or above) the upper limit of the empirical 95% confidence intervals for conditions in which our calculator performed poorly. Bayesian credible limits provided less-biased estimates, however, and we can give a much stronger recommendation for their use in a broad range of data conditions. As mentioned in our results, the one caveat is that lower (but not upper) credible interval limits can misrepresent the actual lower quantiles of empirical sampling distributions when the empirical lower quantiles are smaller than .30. Furthermore, we estimated credible intervals using only noninformative priors, so our results do not necessarily generalize to cases where informative priors would be more appropriate.\nLimitations and future directions. Our simulation results provide initial guidance to researchers who wish to estimate multilevel reliability, but additional work on the topic could be useful. We limited our discussion to single-factor MCFA models with fixed (i.e., nonrandom) factor loadings at Level 1. We therefore do not account for noncongeneric scales, models for which the factor structure varies across levels, nonnormal (e.g., binary) data, the analysis of tetrachoric or polychoric correlations, or models where Level 1 reliability is allowed to vary across Level 2 units. A great deal of research has extended methods for single-level reliability estimation, and future work should similarly examine such extensions to multilevel reliability estimation. Furthermore, our simulation data were both generated and analyzed using a single software package (Mplus), and it is difficult to determine the impact of using a single program on our results. Future research should confirm the previous results using separate software packages. Despite these limitations, our article clearly underscores the benefits of multilevel reliability estimation and highlights conditions for which multilevel reliability estimates may be biased."}]
