Cognitive and physical activities, that range from recent to lifelong, have positive effects on cognition and may reduce the risk of dementia. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] While the causal sequence remains to be established, cognitive activities hypothetically build cognitive reserve, which allows an individual to mitigate the effects of age-related brain pathology. 4, [13] [14] [15] A neurobiological basis for these hypothetical effects has been sought by relating cognitive 5, 16, 17 or physical [18] [19] [20] activity levels to AD biomarkers or postmortem histopathology, and links between a b-amyloid (Ab) biomarker and cognitive 16 and physical 18 activity levels have been reported.\nAb deposition, one of the defining pathologic constituents of AD, likely begins decades before the onset of dementia symptoms. Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET studies, in line with autopsy data, have shown that 25% to 50% of normal older individuals show evidence of Ab accumulation, with the frequency depending on the sample composition and choice of PiB binding cutpoint. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] Because Ab deposition appears well established in many clinically normal older individuals, we tested the hypotheses that cognitive or physical activity was associated with Ab deposition as well as other AD biomarkers of neurodegeneration. We measured Ab burden with PiB-PET, brain metabolism with 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, hippocampal volume with MRI, and cognitive function with neuropsychological tests; in addition, we assessed lifelong cognitive activity 5 and recent physical activity. We hypothesized that greater cognitive or physical activity would be associated with lower PiB retention, greater FDG metabolism, and larger hippocampal volume, as well as better cognitive performance.\nMETHODS Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and participant consents. This study was performed using protocols in accordance with and approved by the institutional review board of the Partners Human Research Committee, and with the informed consent of all participants.\nParticipants. One hundred eighty-six clinically normal older individuals (102 female) participating in the Harvard Aging Brain Study underwent clinical assessments by a study clinician, APOE genotyping, extensive neuropsychological testing, PiB-and FDG-PET imaging, and structural MRI at Massachusetts General Hospital. Participants were between the ages of 65 and 90 years (mean 6 SD, 74 6 6 years) and were from a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds that was estimated using the Hollingshead 27 index. All participants had a Clinical Dementia Rating 28 global score of 0, scored 27 or higher on the Mini-Mental State Examination, 29 performed within 1 SD of education-adjusted cutoff scores on the delayed recall portion of one Logical Memory story of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised, 30 and scored 11 or lower on the Geriatric Depression Scale 31 long form. In addition, verbal IQ was estimated using the American version of the National Adult Reading Test (AMNART). 32 None of the participants met criteria for mild cognitive impairment, had any neurologic or medical illness, or any history of alcoholism, drug abuse, or head trauma.\nCognitive performance. A previously described confirmatory factor analysis 33 was conducted to create cognitive factor scores to reduce the reliance on individual neuropsychological subtests. The variables were organized into 3 primary factors: executive function (Exec), episodic memory (Memory), and processing speed (Speed). Variance in Exec could be further partitioned into that of 3 subfactors: fluency, working memory, and switching.\nCognitive activity. Participants' self-reported history of cognitive activity was assessed using the Cognitive Activities Scale, a previously reported autobiographical questionnaire that has been shown to have high internal consistency and temporal stability. 4, 5, 16 Participants subjectively rated their current activity (11 items) as well as retrospectively rated their past activity at ages 6 (3 items), 12 (6 items), 18 (8 items), and 40 years (8 items) using a 5-point scale (1 5 once a year or less; 2 5 several times a year; 3 5 several times a month; 4 5 several times a week; 5 5 everyday or almost everyday). The questionnaire contained common activities, such as reading, writing, going to the library, and playing games such as crossword puzzles, which had minimal physical demands and applied to a diversity of ethnic and socioeconomic statuses.\nAs in previous studies that used the same questionnaire, composite scores were created for analyses by averaging item responses. [4] [5] [6] 16 Past cognitive activity (CA Past ) was an average of items from ages 6, 12, 18, and 40 years (25 items) and current cognitive activity (CA Current ) was an average of the current responses only (11 items).\nPhysical activity. Participants' physical activity was assessed with an autobiographical questionnaire as well as a pedometer worn by each participant for 7 days. The physical activity questionnaire asked participants to \"indicate the number of occasions and average minutes per occasion\" that they engaged in 6 different \"exercises over the past 2 weeks.\" 5 Activities suggested by the questionnaire included (1) walking for exercise, (2) gardening or yard work, (3) calisthenics or general exercise, (4) bicycle riding, (5) swimming or water exercises, and (6) dancing. The total physical activity (TPA Self ) and walking activity (Walk Self ) in minutes/week were calculated for each participant. Six participants incorrectly completed the physical activity questionnaire and were excluded from these analyses.\nTo evaluate current physical activity objectively, each participant was fitted with a pedometer (Omron Walking style Pro HJ-720IT-E2; Omron Healthcare Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan), which has been shown to accurately measure step count. 34 Based on stride length and body weight, each participant's total walking activity (TWA Ped ) was calculated in units of steps per day. Five participants were missing pedometer data and were not included in analyses using this variable.\nMRI. MRI acquisition and processing have been previously described. 26 Briefly, high-resolution, T1-weighted structural images were acquired with a Siemens Trio 3.0T scanner (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) using 3-dimensional magnetizationprepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequences.\nThe FreeSurfer (FS) software package was used to determine cortical (i.e., gray matter ribbon) thickness and hippocampal volume. [35] [36] [37] Relative hippocampal volume (RelHippoVol) was calculated by regressing out total intracranial volume from hippocampal volume. FS also yielded for each participant's magnetic resonance dataset a probabilistic, atlas-based parcellation of the cortical surface into a set of cortical regions of interest (ROIs); average thickness associated with each cortical ROI was computed as the mean cortical thickness over all vertices in the ROI. 37, 38 PET. PiB-PET data were acquired using a Siemens HR1 (Siemens CTI, Knoxville, TN), expressed as the distribution volume ratio with cerebellar gray reference, coregistered to MRI, and sampled according to FS ROIs as previously described. 26 Partial volume correction was applied as the 2-component method. 39 Mean cortical PiB (mcPiB) retention was calculated in an aggregate cortical ROI and was then pre-log transformed because of a positive skew, violating the assumption of a normal distribution for the dependent variable for significance tests. PiB retention was analyzed as both a continuous and binary variable; a mcPiB distribution volume ratio cutpoint of 1.6 was used to classify individuals into either PiB1 or PiB2 groups, as in previous studies. 26 FDG was acquired using a Siemens HR1 (Siemens CTI). After a transmission scan, 5 mCi of FDG was injected and followed by a 30-minute uptake period before a 30-minute acquisition (ADNI [Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative] protocol). ROIs were defined with FS after coregistration of each participant's MP-RAGE volume and FDG volume similar to the process described above for PiB. FDG was expressed as the standard uptake value ratio with cerebellar cortex as the reference tissue. Mean cortical FDG was calculated in the same aggregate of cortical ROIs as described above for PiB. In addition, since the precuneus is frequently associated with hypometabolism in AD dementia and predementia, we examined a precuneus ROI (PrecFDG). Since the 2 ROIs were highly correlated (r 5 0.88, p , 0.0001), only PrecFDG is reported.\nStatistical analysis. Statistical analysis was completed with JMP Pro 10.0.0 and SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Two-tailed t tests were used to compare means between groups (M vs F, PiB1 vs PiB2, APO e4 carrier vs noncarrier). Differences in the presence of an APO e4 allele between groups were evaluated using contingency plots and a 2-tail Fisher exact test. Bivariate comparisons of activity variables were expressed with Pearson correlation r values.\nFor mcPiB, PrecFDG, and RelHippoVol, each as a dependent variable in a separate analysis, we ran a backward elimination general linear model (GLM) (a 5 0.05 cutoff) with an initial simultaneous predictor set of the following: age, APO e4 dose, AMNART IQ, years of education, TWA Ped , CA Past , and CA Current . We then ran the same group of GLMs for mcPiB, PrecFDG, and RelHippoVol, but substituted TPA Self for TWA Ped into the model. For mcPiB, a follow-up backward elimination GLM with the same simultaneous predictor set was again analyzed, but also included interaction terms of APO e4 dose 3 CA Past and APO e4 dose 3 CA Current . Residuals of all models were checked for conformance to assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity. Additional backward elimination multiple logistic regression analyses analogous to the GLMs for mcPiB were run but where binary PiB status, i.e., PiB1 or PiB2, was the predicted dependent variable.\nFor Exec, Memory, and Speed as dependent variables in separate models, we also ran a backward elimination GLM analysis with an initial predictor set of the following: age, APO e4 dose, AMNART IQ, years of education, TWA Ped , CA Past , CA Current , mcPiB, PrecFDG, and RelHippoVol. We then ran the same group of GLMs but substituted TPA Self for TWA Ped into the model. Furthermore, we ran more focused GLMs separately for Exec, Memory, and Speed, in which CA Past , CA Current, age, and APO e4 dose were forced simultaneous predictors. Residuals were checked for all models as above."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Participants. PiB status. There were 46 PiB1 and 140 PiB2 individuals (table 1) . PiB1 individuals were more likely to be APO e4 carriers (p , 0.0001), were older (p 5 0.006), and had lower Memory scores (p 5 0.04) compared with PiB2. There was no Ab-related difference in AMNART IQ, years of education, socioeconomic status, Speed, Exec, CA measures, or physical activity. There was no difference in PrecFDG between the PiB groups; however, the PiB1 group had smaller RelHippoVol (p 5 0.008) compared with the PiB2 group.\nSex. There were 102 women and 84 men in the sample (table e-1 on the Neurology \u00ae Web site at Neurology.org). There were no sex differences in age, AMNART IQ, years of education, socioeconomic status, APO e4 carrier status, Speed, or Exec; Memory scores trended nonsignificantly higher in women (p 5 0.06). Women reported greater CA Past (p 5 0.007) and CA Current (p 5 0.03). There were no sex differences in TPA Self or Walk Self , but the TWA Ped measure was lower in women (p 5 0.03). Women had lower PrecFDG (p 5 0.01), but there were no sex differences in mcPiB retention or RelHippoVol.\nAPOE genotype status. APOE genotype data were not available in 9 participants (all of whom were PiB2). Of the remaining 177 participants, 54 were APO e4 carriers (2/4 in 6, 3/4 in 45, 4/4 in 3) while 123 were APO e4 noncarriers (2/2 in 1, 2/3 in 13, 3/3 in 109). There was no difference in age, years of education, socioeconomic status, AMNART IQ, or any cognitive factor score between carriers and noncarriers. There were no differences in cognitive activity or selfreported physical activity measures between carriers and noncarriers. Noncarriers had greater TWA Ped (p 5 0.04). There were no differences in RelHippoVol or PrecFDG uptake. APO e4 carriers had greater mcPiB retention than noncarriers (p , 0.0001).\nCognitive activity. Bivariate comparisons showed that greater CA Past and CA Current were correlated (r 5 0.49, p , 0.0001) and each was associated with higher education (CA Past r 5 0.30, p , 0.0001; CA Current r 5 0.29, p , 0.0001) and higher AMNART IQ (CA Past r 5 0.29, p , 0.0001; CA Current r 5 0.26, p 5 0.0004). Education and AMNART IQ were correlated with each other (r 5 0.38, p , 0.0001). No measure of CA was related to age.\nPhysical activity. Bivariate comparisons showed that greater self-reported recent physical activity (TPA Self or Walk Self ) correlated with greater TWA Ped (r . 0.23, p , 0.005). Age was not related to either TPA Self or Walk Self ; however, increasing age was significantly associated with reduced TWA Ped (r 5 20.30, p , 0.0001)."}, {"section_title": "Prediction of biomarkers. Relations of activity variables", "text": "to AD biomarkers are demonstrated in figure 1 . For the GLM analyses, PiB was significantly (all significant findings were at p , 0.01 except where noted) predicted only by age and APO e4 dose, both in the expected positive direction. APO e4 dose and CA interactions were nonsignificant. The logistic regression predicting PiB status (1/2) showed the same significant predictors. Higher PrecFDG was significantly predicted by older age and marginally by higher current physical activity (TPA Self p 5 0.068, and TWA Ped p 5 0.064 in separate GLM analyses). RelHippoVol was significantly predicted only by age, with older age predicting smaller volume. Except for the marginal relation of TPA Self and TWA Ped to PrecFDG, no measure of cognitive or physical activity was significantly related to any of the biomarkers. In all GLM models, residuals were reasonably normally distributed and homoscedastic in conformance with test assumptions.\nPrediction of current cognitive performance. Relations of activity variables to cognitive performance are demonstrated in figure 2. When age and APO e4 dose were forced simultaneous predictors in the GLM along with CA Past and CA Current , greater CA Current was significantly associated with better Exec and Speed, but not Memory (p 5 0.12). CA Past was not significantly related to any of the cognitive factor scores. When all relevant covariates were included with CA Past and CA Current in backward elimination GLMs, age and AMNART IQ had robust significant (p , 0.03) effects in the expected directions for all 3 cognitive factor scores (Exec, Memory, and Speed), while Education had a robust significant (p , 0.005) positive effect for Exec and Speed but not Memory. TWA Ped was marginally positively related to Exec (p 5 0.07). CA Current and CA Past were not significant when AMNART IQ and education were covaried, with which they were moderately positively correlated. RelHippoVol had a significant positive effect on Memory (p 5 0.01) and borderline significant (0.05 , p , 0.1) positive effect on Exec and Speed; mcPiB had a marginal (p 5 0.056) negative relation to Memory, and PrecFDG did not have any significant effects on any of the cognitive factor scores. In all GLM models above, residuals were reasonably normally distributed and homoscedastic. DISCUSSION We did not find evidence of a protective effect of either cognitive activity, past or current, or recent physical activity on AD biomarkers. However, greater cognitive activity was associated with greater premorbid IQ and better performance on neuropsychological tests. A previous study in a subset of these participants 33 also reported a direct correlation between reduced cognitive performance using the neuropsychological factor scores with AD pathology biomarkers. These findings suggest that while a history of lifelong cognitive activity may support better cognitive performance, this relation is mediated by a mechanism independent of Ab burden and markers of neurodegeneration (glucose metabolism and hippocampal volume) in cognitively normal older individuals.\nA prior study 16 compared PiB-PET data in 65 cognitively normal participants with self-reported current and past activity using the same cognitive activities scale as the current study. In contrast to our findings, they reported a direct association between greater cognitive activity and less PiB uptake. Past cognitive activity drove the relation with PiB uptake, and therefore they divided their sample into tertiles based on past cognitive activity. They found that cognitively normal older individuals who reported greater past cognitive activity had lower Ab burden that was similar to a sample of 11 young controls, whereas cognitively normal older individuals who reported less past cognitive activity had greater Ab burden that was similar to a sample of 10 individuals with AD dementia. In agreement with the current findings, they found no relation of selfreported physical activity to PiB-PET. The different findings between these 2 studies may be attributable to our larger sample size, lower levels of activity reported in our participants, and our backward elimination statistical approach.\nAnother study 40 of 118 cognitively normal individuals, which included all 65 individuals from the previously mentioned study, 16 used hierarchical regression models adjusted for age, sex, and years of education to examine effects of APO e4 carrier status, lifetime cognitive activity, and the interaction of APO e4 and cognitive activity with PiB retention. They found that lifetime cognitive activity moderated the effect of APOE genotype, such that PiB retention was lower in e4 carriers who reported higher lifetime cognitive activity. They suggest that greater lifetime cognitive activity may prevent AD pathology, specifically in genetically susceptible individuals. In contrast, we found no interaction of APO e4 dose with cognitive activity in relation to PiB retention.\nUsing PiB-PET, FDG-PET, and hippocampal volume as biomarkers in a sample of 515 clinically normal individuals, another study 17 found that biomarker data were not correlated with lifetime intellectual, current intellectual, or current physical activities. As in the current study, cognitive activity and biomarkers, but not physical activity, were related to cognitive testing performance. A neuropathologic study 6 used the same retrospective cognitive activity questionnaire at baseline as the current study, and participants also underwent longitudinal cognitive testing to estimate rate of cognitive decline. Postmortem evaluations on 294 participants included measures of Ab plaque burden, neurofibrillary tangle density, gross and microscopic cerebral infarcts, and neocortical Lewy bodies. In agreement with the current findings, greater cognitive activity across the lifespan was associated with slower latelife cognitive decline that was independent of common neuropathologic measures.\nStrengths of the current study include the use of multiple neuroimaging modalities to measure multiple biomarkers of AD, as well as the examination of multiple cognitive domains using sensitive tests that yield a wide range of scores in clinically normal elderly. Another strength is the use of pedometers to record an objective measure of physical activity not available in previous studies, although the measure relied on participant compliance and was limited to only 1-week duration. The study is limited, similar to previous studies, in that it was a cross-sectional association study. Measurement of lifelong cognitive and recent physical activity relied on a retrospective self-reported questionnaire, which is not free from participants' bias. Objective measures of lifelong cognitive and physical activity could possibly enable a better test of these hypotheses. Nonetheless, these results add to the current literature and align well with the results of other studies with large sample sizes, 6, 17 finding a relationship between lifelong cognitive activity and current neuropsychological testing performance without a direct relationship between cognitive or physical activity and biomarkers of AD."}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": "Christopher M.
