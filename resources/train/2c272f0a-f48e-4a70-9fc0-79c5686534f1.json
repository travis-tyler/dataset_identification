The Hawkins-Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988 (P.L. 100-297) mandated specifically that NCES collect and publish data about dropping out of school. One of these mandates requires NCES annually to report dropout and retention rates for a 12-month period to the appropriate committees of Congress on the second Tuesday after Labor Day, beginning in 1989. This report was prepared pursuant to that mandate and is NCES' fourth annual report on dropout rates. This report presents the data for 1991 on high school dropout and retention rates. This report also examines high school completion and graduation rates. At the conclusion of the report is a discussion of new data collection efforts by NCES that have a direct bearing on the issues of high school dropouts and graduates. The report is based on the best and most current national data available at this time. It utilizes the Current Population Survey conducted by the Bureau of the Census to develop national event and status dropout rates; 1990 Decennial Census to develop status dropout rates for states, counties, and large cities; and the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 to develop an 8th-through 10th-grade cohort dropout rate. NCES is currently pursuing an extensive, integrated program to expand and improve data collected about dropouts in response to the provisions of P.L. 100-297. These efforts were described in an earlier report, Activities to Plan and Implement the Reporting of School Dropout and Retention Indicators: Status Report to the United States Congress on Activities Related to Section 406 (G) of the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA) as Amended by Public Law 100 -297, May 1989. To this end, a dropout statistics collection was initiated in the 1991-92 school year as a component of the NCES Common Core of Data (CCD). I hope the information in this report will be useful in discussions about this critical national issue.  1972 1974 1976 1978 1980 1982 1984 1972 1974 1976 1978 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1991 Year SOURCE: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Current Population Survey, October (various years), unpublished tabulations."}, {"section_title": "Cohort Rates", "text": "Some 6.8 percent of the eighth-grade cohort of 1988 dropped out of school between the 8th and 10th grade. There were not significant differences in the percentage of male and female eighthgraders dropping out. Hispanic and black students in the 1988 eighth grade cohort dropped out at almost twice the rate of whites and Asians. In 1990, the vast majority of dropouts from the eighth grade class of 1988 planned to eventually complete their high school education. (In fact, 2.4 percent claimed that they already had completed by passing the GED exam.) Less than 5 percent did not plan to return to school-3.5 percent of males and 4.8 percent of females. Some of the most common reasons that students cited for dropping out were related to their experiences in the schools they left behindincluding a general dislike for school and/or failure in their schoolwork. Furthermore, over 40 percent reported the opportunity to improve their academic skills as a reason to return to school. About one-third of female dropouts said they left school because they were pregnant. A relatively large proportion of female dropouts also said they would be likely to return to school if they did not have to support their family, or if they could attend classes at night or on the weekends.\nLongitudinal or cohort analyses are based on repeated measures of a group of individuals with a set of shared experiences. The initial experience that is used to define the group can be date of birth, age at a particular point in time, entry into school, grade level in school, entry into the military, marriage, or any one of a number of other specific events. These analyses can be done in one of two ways. Consecutive ages or grades taken from existing cross-sectional data across a series of years can be linked together to portray the experiences of an age or grade cohort. This approach can be operationalized using CPS data on enrollments and dropouts. Alternatively, a prospective study can be used to follow the same group of individuals over a number of years. This approach has been used by NCES, where particular grades in school have been selected as the starting points for longitudinal studies of educational processes and experiences. Cohort Analysis of National Sample Survey Data Table 16 provides an illustration of cohort dropout rates based on cross-sectional CPS data. In 1979, approximately 11 percent of the 16-through 18-year-old age group were identified as status dropouts. Three years later in 1982 this group was 19, 20, and 21 years old; by that time most of these individuals would have completed high school. The increased dropout rate at ages 19 through 21 (16.6 percent) reflects the dropout rates observed in the cross-sectional event rates for grades 10-12. By 1985, at ages 22 through 24, the dropout rate for this group had declined to about 14 percent; this decrease was most likely a result of delayed decisions to complete high school or an equivalent program.28 The cross-sectional variations noted earlier across age groups and over time are also evident in this table. Comparisons across age groups in each year (rows) show higher rates at ages 19-21 than at ages 16-18. This increase was then followed by a leveling off from ages 19-24. (In this case the late completer phenomena evident in the cohort analysis was not evident in the cross-sectional data.) Time trends for these age groups (columns) reflect an overall tendency towards decreasing dropout rates over time, consistent with the downward trends observed in the aggregate status dropout rate for 16-through 24-yearolds.29"}, {"section_title": "ix I i I High School Completion and Graduation", "text": "The high school completion rate, defined as the percentage of all persons ages 21 and 22 who have completed high school by receiving a high school diploma or equivalency certificate, was 85.7 percent in 1991.

The Special Study Panel of Education Indicators' 1991 Report noted that students who drop out of school are not acquiring the competencies needed to function successfully in the American economy.1 The Panel expressed concern that despite modest improvements in the dropout rates nationwide, a sizable number of youth (3.9 million) are not in school and have not completed high school. They suggested that unemployment statistics reported by educational level could help monitor the economic consequences of education and training. Unemployment statistics for 1991 show that at least two times as many dropouts as graduates were unemployed (23.1 percent versus 9.4 percent).2 The national importance of this educational problem was also highlighted by the President and governors' inclusion of high school completion in their 1990 list of national education goals. The specific goal is to increase the high school graduation rate to at least 90 percent by the year 2000. Two additional objectives were identified as part of the aim to meet the high school completion goal: The nation must dramatically reduce its dropout rate, and 75 percent of those students who do drop out will successfully complete a high school degree or its 1."}, {"section_title": "EVENT, STATUS, AND COHORT DROPOUT RATES Event Rates", "text": "Event dropout rates provide a measure of recent dropout experiences. This rate measures the proportion of individuals who dropped out of school over a specified time interval, such as a 12-month period. Using the October Current Population Survey (CPS), data are available on the number or proportion of students who were enrolled in high school a year ago, are not enrolled in grades 10-12 now, and have not completed high schoolthat is, the number or proportion of students who dropped out in the past year.5 The CPS does not collect data on last year's enrollment for persons younger char, 15 years old. This makes it difficult to calculate dropout rates below grade 10. Using the existing data, event dropout rates can be computed in the aggregate over the grade 10 through grade 12 range, or separately as grade specific rates for each grade -10, 11, and 12. Similarly, they can be aggregated over a range of ages, or separately for single years of age. The aggregate, grade-specific, and age-specific event dropout and school retention rates are shown below for the most recent years, along with trends in the event dropout rate from 1972-1991. Event Rate: 1991 Table 1 shows the aggregate event rates for 1989-1991. In 1991, approximately 348,000 students or 4.0 percent of all high school students 15 through 24 years old dropped out of grades 10-12.6 The school retention rate is the converse of the event dropout rate. That is, the event dropout rate plus the school retention rate sum to 100 percent. The school retention rate reflects the proportion of 15-through 24-year-old students remaining in school from one year to the next or completing high school in that year. It was 96.0 percent for 1991. Table l also shows that the percentage of students dropping out in 1991 is the same as the annual rate for 1990.7 5Specifically, the numerator of the event rate for 1991 is the number of persons 15 through 24 years old surveyed in 1991 who were enrolled in high school in October 1990, were not enrolled in high school (grades 10-12) in October 1991, and who also did not complete high school (i.e., had not received a high school diploma or an equivalency certificate) between October 1990 and October 1991. The denominator of the event rate is the sum of the dropouts (i.e., the numerator) and the number of all persons 15 through 24 years old who completed grades 10, 11, and 12 last year or who graduated high school last year. 6This year's report compared to last year's report uses a slightly different definition of the event dropout rate. Specifically, this year's rate includes in the denominator all students who reported they graduated high school last year, regardless of whether they reported completing more than 12 years of school. This results in a slightly larger denominator and a slightly lower estimate of the rate. For example, using last year's definition, the rate for 1990 was 4.1 percent, while using this year's definition the 1990 rate is 4.0 percent. 7Standard errors for all tables are provided in appendix A of this report.  Table 2 shows the 1991 event dropout and school retention rates for demographic characteristics of persons 15 through 24 years old. The event dropout rate was highest among 15-through 24-year-olds living in families at the low income level, intermediate at middle income levels, and lowest at high income levels.8 Although the dropout rates disaggregated by race-ethnicity appear to follow the patterns reported in rezent years, where the dropout rates observed for Hispanic students were higher than those for white students, the observed differences between racial or ethnic categories in the 1991 event dropout rates were not statistically significant. Students residing in central cities dropped out at a higher rate than did students in suburban areas.9 The event rate for 1991 was not statistically different from the rate for 1990, nor were there significant differences between the rate for 1991 and the rate for 1990 for males, females, or members of different racial or ethnic groups. 8While the event of dropping out may have taken place at any time over the previous year, family income is measured for the 12-month period preceding the survey in October of the current year. It is therefore possible that the family income of the student at the time they dropped out was somewhat different than their current family income. Furthermore, family income is from a single question asked of the household respondent in the October CPS. In some cases, there are persons 15 to 24 years old living in the household that are unrelated to the household respondent, yet whose family income is defined as the income of the family of the household respondent. Also, persons may be living in a household without their parents. Family income in this case measures something other than family background. However, an analysis of 1991 dropout rates by family status indicated that the bias introduced by persons not living in households with their parents was not significant. See the technical appendix for more details. 9The statistical significance of these comparisons were assessed with Student's t-test with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. For a full discussion of the statistical methods used in this report, see appendix B. While 10th through 12th grade students living in low income families were more likely to drop out than their peers, and students living in central cities were more likely to drop out than their suburban counterparts, the majority of all students were white, lived in suburban or non-metropolitan areas and in middle or high income families. Therefore, the majority of students who dropped out over the year were not from minority backgrounds and did not live in low income households or in central cities. On average, 56.9 percent were white, 58.6 percent lived in suburban or non-metropolitan areas, and 64.1 percent lived in middle or high income households. Grade-specific event dropout and school retention rates for persons 15 through 24 years old in grades 10-12 in 1991 are shown in Table 3. In 1991, approximately 105,000 students or 3.3 percent of all 10th graders and 101,000 or 3.2 percent of all 11th graders dropped out of school. About 4.7 percent of the 12th graders (142,000 students) dropped out in 1991.10 Age-specific event dropout and school retention rates for persons ages 15-24 years old in grades 10 through 12 in 1991 are shown in Table 4. The dropout rate for students enrolled in grades 10-12 increases with each age, from 2.5 percent of the 15-and 16-yearolds to 5.8 percent of the 19-year-olds and 10.3 percent of the 20-through 24-year-olds. Also, about 60 percent of the 15-through 24-year-olds who dropped out of grades 10-12 in 1991 were age 17 or 18.

Figure 1 shows the aggregate event rates for the years 1972-1991.11 The event rates indicate that the incidence of dropping out has fallen over the last decade.12 Specifically, in the late 1970s, the event rate was over 6 percent. By 1991, it was only 4.0 percent.13 Furthermore, dropout rates for white and black students have generally fallen during the last decade. For example, in 1981 some 9.7 percent of black students 15 through 24 years old dropped out of high school, whereas in 1991 some 6.0 percent of black students in this age group did so. For white students, the percent of 15-through 24-year-olds who dropped out of high school was 4.8 percent in 1981 and 3.2 percent in 1991. Estimates of the Hispanic dropout rate evidence no apparent statistical trend, but were consistently higher than comparable rates for whites over this period.14 11 Supporting data and standard errors for all figures are provided in appendix A of this report. 12Beginning with 1986, to improve the quality of the data, the Bureau of the Census instituted new editing procedures for cases with missing data on school enrollment items. The effect of the editing changes lowered the event dropout rate by about 0.4 percent, thus confounding the actual size of the decline in the dropout rates in the late 1980s. However, the effect of these editing changes were held constant when the tests of trend were conducted. See the technical appendix for further details. 13The statistical significance of the trends presented in this section was assessed using weighted least squares regression.

Black male rates fell from about 9 percent in 1981 to about 5 percent in 1991.16 15While table 5 displays biennial data for the years between 1981 and 1991, the statistical analysis of the trends in the event rates was conducted on the data for all of the years from 1981-1991.

CPS data can be used to calculate the number or proportion of individuals who, as of October of any given year, have not completed high school and are not currently enrolled in schoo1.18 Those persons who are still in school and those who have completed high school after dropping out are not dropouts. The aggregate and age-specific rates and numbers of status dropouts for 16-through 24-year-olds in 1991 are presented below, followed by an examination of trends in the status dropout rate from 1972-1991. Roughly speaking, the status dropout rate is a composite of the event rates summed over several years. The count of all dropouts includes status dropouts from the previous year, plus new dropouts in the most current year, less those dropouts who returned to school or completed high school during the current year. (See Technical Appendix B for a more detailed discussion.) 18The numerator of this rate is the number of individuals age 16 through 24 who, as of October of any given year, have not completed high school and are not currently enrolled in school. The denominator is the number of persons in that age group in Ociober of that year. Status Rate: 1991 In 1991 about 3.9 million persons in the United States ages 16 through 24 were high school dropouts, representing approximately 12.5 percent of all persons in this age group (table 6). The proportion of dropouts in 1991 was essentially unchanged from the previous year's rate of 12.1 percent and the 1989 rate of 12.6 percent.19 Recently available data from the 1990 Decennial Census provide information on educational attainment and current enrollment status for the population ages 16 to 19. These data can be used to compute a type of status rate that show the percentage of 16-through 19-year-olds who were not enrolled in school and had not graduated from high school in the nation, and within each state, county, and large city. Nationally, about 1.6 million or 11.2 percent of all 16-through 19-year-olds were high school dropouts in 1990 (figure 4). When this status rate was computed for each state, he rates ranged from 4.3 percent in North Dakota to 14.9 percent in Nevada and 19.1 percent in the District of Columbia (table 7). While the rates fell between 9.0 and 12.0 in 25 states, them were 11 states plus the District of Columbia with rates above that range and 14 states with rates below that range.

Some 61 cities have rates from 9.0 to 12.0 percent; an additional 37 cities have status dropout rates below 9.0 percent. In the remaining 152 cities, the percentage of 16-through 19-year-olds who were high school dropouts in 1990 exceeds 9.0 percent, and within that group 22 cities have dropout rates over 20.0 percent. !Detailed data for the 250 largest cities are included in appendix table C2). Comparable data for all counties in the United States show that the percentage of 16through 19-year-olds who were not enrolled and had not completed high school in 1990 ranges from less than 1 percent to 55.7 percent. Some 766 counties have rates from 9.0 to 12.0 percent. Of the 1395 counties with rates below 9.0 percent, about one-third (465 counties) have fewer than 5 percent of the 16-through 19-year-old population who were classified as dropouts. On the other hand, 980 counties have status dropout rates above 12.0 percent; within that group, more than 20 percent of the 16-through 19-year-olds were dropouts in 1990 in 133 counties. (Detailed data for counties are in appendix table C2.) Table 8 shows age-specific status dropout rates for this age group. Examination of the data shows that the rate increases from age 16 through age 18, as the young adult population passes through the grades where they are most likely to drop out. After age 18 the rates are fairly comparable at each year of age.  Table 9 shows the 1991 status dropout rates for persons age 16 through 24 with different demographic characteristics. In October 1991, there were similar numbers of male and female dropouts. Income differentials in the status dropout rate for 16-through 24year -olds mirror those observed for the event dropout rates. When dropouts living in families with low, middle, and high incomes are compared, the status dropout rate decreases as income increases.2\u00b0 Persons living in central cities, and in the southern or western regions of the country, were more likely than others to be status dropouts.21 The 20While the event of dropping out for the status rate may have taken place at any time in the past, family income is measured for the 12-month period preceding the survey in October of the current year. It is therefore possible that the family income of the student at the time the individual dropped out was somewhat different than the current family income. Furthermore, family income is from a single question asked of the household respondent in the October CPS. In some cases, there are persons 15 to 24 years old living in the household that are unrelated to the household respondent, yet whose family income is defined as the income of the family of the household respondent. Also, persons may be living in a household without their parents. Family income in this case measures something other than family background. However, an analysis of 1991 dropout rates by family status indicated that the bias introduced by persons not living in households with their parents was not significant. See the technical appendix for more details. 21There are four Censw regions used in this report: Northeast, Midwest. South, and West. The Northeast consists of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticdt, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. The Midwest consists of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas. The South consists of Delaware, Maryland, Washington, D.C., Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas. The West consists of Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, California, Alaska, and Hawaii. status dropout rate for black 16-through 24-year-olds was higher than the rate for whites, and the rate for Hispanics was higher than the rates for blacks and whites. The 1991 status rate for all persons ages 16 through 24 was not statistically different from the 1990 rate, nor were there significant differences between the 1991 and 1990 rates for males, females, or members of different racial or ethnic groups. Analysis of status dropout rates for racial-ethnic groups by income level shows that the pattern observed across income levels was repeated for both white and black 16through 24-year-olds, and the rates for those two groups were comparable at each income level (table 10). More specifically, the status dropout rates for whites and blacks (and Hispanics) were highest in the low income group; and the rates for whites and blacks in middle income families were higher than the rates in high income families. When comparisons are drawn across racial-ethnic groups within each income level, there were no differences in status dropout rates of white and black 16-through 24-year-olds. The rates for Hispanic 16-through 24-year-olds were, however, higher within each income level.  Table 11 indicates that the general racial-ethnic patterns seen in table 9 are repeated in each region. The status dropout rates for Hispanics were higher than the rates for whites and blacks in each region, and the rates for blacks were higher than those for whites in the Northeast and Midwest. In addition, whites residing in the South were more likely to be status dropouts than were whites in the Northeast or Midwest. The status dropout rates for Hispanics range from 2 to 5 times those of whites and blacks in the nation as a whole and within each region. In October 1991, approximately one-third of all Hispanics ages 16 through 24 had not finished high school and were not enrolled in school. Data from the November 1989 supplement to the CPS can be used to examine subgroup membership, generation, and educational level within the Hispanic population.22 In November 1989, the dropout rates for all Hispanics, for Mexican-Americans, and Puerto Ricans were 3 times the rate for non-Hispanics (table 12). The rate for Cubans was about the same as the non-Hispanic rate:   Given that nearly half (43 percent) of all Hispanics ages 16-24 were not born in the 50 states or the District of Columbia, an analysis of dropout rates for Hispanic young adults by place of birth and generational status may inform the question of the extent to which the high Hispanic dropout rate is influenced by the educational experiences of recent immigrants (table 13). The data in table 13 show that the status dropout rate of 43 percent for Hispanics ages 16-24 years who were born elsewhere was higher than the status dropout rates for first generation Hispanics (17.3 percent) or second generation or more (23.7 percent). However, in each of these three groups the rate for Hispanic young adults was higher than the rate for non-Hispanics in the same group. Not only were the Hispanic dropout rates high, but on average, a larger proportion of Hispanic dropouts completed less than 9 years of school than non-Hispanic dropouts. Data in table 14 show that as of 1989, approximately 46 percent of the Hispanic dropouts had less than a 9th grade education, compared to about 19 percent of the non-Hispanic dropouts. "}, {"section_title": "Trends over Time", "text": "The percentage of young persons who are status dropouts has generally declined over the last two decades (figure 5). In 1972, approximately 15 percent of persons 16 through 24 years old had not completed high school and were not currently enrolled, while in 1991 some 13 percent were dropouts.23 23The statistical significance of the trends presented in this section-was assessed using weighted least squares regression analyses. For a full discussion of the statistical methods used, see appendix B.  1972 1974 1976 1978 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1991 Figure 5 also shows that the percentage of blacks who were status dropouts has decreased substantially since the early 1970s (from 21 percent in 1972 to 14 percent in 1991), while the status dropout rate for whites has decreased less (from 12 percent in 1972 to 9 percent in 1991). Although the year-to-year estimates fluctuate, the Hispanic status rate showed no trend and has been consistently higher than the status rates for whites.24 However, Hispanics make up an increasing proportion of all dropouts (figure 6), due mainly to the changing composition of the population ages 16 through 24. While the population of whites ages 16 through 24 has decreased from approximately 28 million in 1980 to around 22 million in 1991, the population of Hispanics ages 16 through 24 has increased from approximately 2.5 million in 1980 to around 3.5 million in 1991. The black population of this age range has held constant at approximately 4 million persons. Because Hispanics now make up a larger proportion of the population, even without the decreases in the status dropout rates for whites and blacks, Hispanics would constitute a larger proportion of status dropouts.   1974 1976 1978 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1991 Year SOURCE: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Current Population Survey, October (various years), unpublished data The relationship between white female and male status rates changed over the last 20 years (figure 7). White female status rates declined from about 13 percent in 1972 to only 9 percent in 1991. White male rates remained fairly constant from 1972 to 1984, but have declined since, from about 12 percent in 1984 to just under 9 percent in 1991.25 Over the last 20 years, the status rates of both black males and black females declined. Black male rates declined from about 22 percent in 1972 to 14 percent in 1991, and black female rates declined from 21 percent in 1972 to approximately 17 percent in 1991.26 25As was shown in some detail in the 1988 dropout report, some of the difference in male and female trends may reflect the influence of the military buildup during the Vietnam War. Since CPS covers only the civilian, non-institutionalized population, the CPS estimates for the number of 16-through 24-year-old males in the population and the number of male dropouts do not reflect the large proportion of males in this age group in military service during the period 1968-1974. 26The status dropout rate for black females appears to have increased in recent years, but the observed differences are not statistically significant.  1972 1974 1976 1978 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1991 The decline observed in the aggregate status dropout rate over the last two decades was evident at each age as well (figure 8). Also, the age patterns observed in the 1991 data are apparent over time as well, with a higher rate at each age from 16 to 17 to 18 and 19. This reflects the experiences of the young adult population as they pass through the years when dropping out is most likely to occur.  1972 1974 1976 1978 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1991 The 1991 income differentials in dropout rates were evident over the last decade (figure 9). More specifically, there were no differences between the status dropout rates of white and black 16-to 24-year-olds within each income group. In addition, the rates for whites and blacks were constant within each income group since the early 1980s. The rates for Hispanic 16-to 24-year-olds appear to be higher than the rates for whites and blacks, especially at the low and middle income levels, but as is the case in other comparisons, the small sample sizes for Hispanics lead to erratic results.\u00b02  1972 19742 1976 1978 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1991 Year  19742 197619742 197819742 198019742 198219742 Year 198419742 198619742 1988 1590 1991"}, {"section_title": "High income", "text": "1 Low income is defined as the bottom 20 percent of all family incomes for the relevant year; middle income is between 20 and 80 percent of all family incomes; and high income is the top 20 percent of all family incomes.

Longitudinal data offer the additional advantage of tracing individual students who drop out and re-enter to 28In some cohorts the rate for the 22-through 24-year-old age group holds constant relative to the rate for the 19-through 21-year-old age group, while in others it declines. 29Tests of the sends in these data were conducted on all years 1972 through 1991, not just the years presented here. provide measures of returning and late high school completion. In addition, to the extent that the previous experiences and behaviors impact on the individual student's decision to drop out, a longitudinal data base provides the data necessary to describe the dropouts background characteristics and educational experiences in a way that is not possible with the cross-sectional CPS data used in the computation of the event and status dropout rates. Over the last decade NCES has conducted the High School and Beyond study (HS&B), a longitudinal study of the high school sophomore class of 1980. The data from the HS&B third followup indicate that 17.3 percent of the 1980 sophomore cohort dropped out of high school by the end of their scheduled senior year: 14.8 percent of white students, 22.2 percent of black students, and 27.9 percent of Hispanic students. By 1986 about 46 percent of these dropouts (8 percent of all students in the cohort) had returned to school and either earned a high school diploma or its equivalent.\" The most recent NCES longitudinal study, the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), is the first of its longitudinal education studies to begin surveying students as early as eighth grade. NELS:88 provides the unprecedented opportunity to study young dropouts on a national scale. NELS:88 also provides a basis for examining the contextual factors associated with dropping out, especially those related to the school. In addition, it provides data needed to profile the movement of students in and out of school, including alternative high school programs. NELS:88 startedvdth the base-year data collection in which students, parents, teachers, and schoorlidtTiiiistrators were selected to participate in the survey. The total eighth-grade enroll ent for the 1,052 NELS:88 sample schools was 202,996. During the listing procedures (before 24-26 students were selected per school), 5.35 percent of the students were excluded because they were identified by school staff as being incapable of completing the NELS:88 instruments owing to limitations in their language proficiency or to mental or physical disabilities. Ultimately, 93 percent or 24,599 of the sample students participated in the base-year survey in the spring of 1988. The NELS:88 first followup survey was conducted in the spring of 1990. Students, dropouts, teachers, and school administrators participated in the followup, with a successful data collection effort for approximately 93 percent of the base-year student respondents. In addition, because the characteristics and education outcomes of the students excluded from the base year may differ from those of students who participated in the base-year data collection, a special study was initiated to identify the enrollment status of a representative sample of the base-year ineligible students. Data from this sample were then combined with first followup data for the computation of 8th-to 10th-grade cohort dropout rates.31 This process of tracking the education outcomes of a national sample of students will be continued with future followups; during the second followup in 1992 most of the students in this cohort will be near the end of their senior year of high school, and by the third followup in 1994 most will have completed high school. These longitudinal data will provide an opportunity to study the movements of students dropping out and then returning to school, as well as the progress of students staying in school until high school completion. Data from the second and third followups can then be compared to the earlier results from HS&B, and the overall dropout rates and high school completion rates will provide the first opportunity to study the outcomes of an individual cohort as its members make the transition from eighth grade to high school and then to alternative postsecondary outcomes. Cohort Rates from NELS :88 1988NELS :88 -1990 Table 17 shows the cohort dropout and retention rates for the eighth -grade class of 1988 for the spring of 1990. Some 6.8 percent of this cohort dropped out of school between the 8th grade and the end of the 10th grade.32 While there were no significant differences in the percentage of males and females dropping out, cohort rates were significantly higher among blacks and Hispanics than among whites and Asians.33 "}, {"section_title": "Reasons for Dropping Out", "text": "During the first followup survey, dropouts in the NELS:88 8th-grade cohort reported dropping out for school-related reasons more often than for job-related or family concerns (table 18). Over half of the students left because they \"did not like school,\" while about 40 percent left because they were failing school. Furthermore, over half of male dropouts said they left because they \"could not get along with teachers\" (only about 17 percent of female students left for this reason). In addition, 23 percent felt they \"did not belong\" at school. However, black dropouts were less likely than white aropouts to report this as a reason for dropping out. Only 8 percent of black dropouts felt they didn't belong compared with 31 percent of white dropouts.M While overall, dropouts were more likely to report school-related reasons for dropping out, female dropout! were more likely than males to report family-related reasons. Almost one-third of female dropouts (31 percent), said they left school because they were pregnant-21 percent of Hispanics, 41 percent of blacks, and 32 percent of whites. Furthermore, 24 percent of female dropouts left because they had gotten married, compared with only 3 percent of male dropouts. However, black dropouts were far less likely than their peers to have reported \"got married\" as a reason for dropping out-1 percent compared with 22 percent of Hispanic and 15 percent of white dropouts. 34Although there appear to be other racialethnic differences in the reasons for dropping out, nore of these are statistically significant due to the relatively small samples of 8th-through 10th -grade dropouts in the NELS:88 survey. i "}, {"section_title": "4,3", "text": "Returning and/or Completing School In 1990, the vast majority of dropouts from the 8th-grade class of 1988 planned to eventually complete their high school education (table 19). (In fact, 2.4 percent claimed that they already had completed by passing the GED exam.) Less than 5 percent did not plan to return to school-3.5 percent of males and 4.8 percent of females. Students who had left school were also asked which of a set of reasons would make them somewhat or very likely to return to school. About 65 percent reported that they would be somewhat or very likely to return if they felt sure they could get a good job after graduationwith black students more likely than white students to say this would be a reason to return (85 percent compared with 56 percent, table 20). A large proportion of students also reported that they would be likely to return to school if they felt they could graduate (62 percent). Again, black dropouts were more likely than white dropouts to see this as a reason to return-85 percent compared with 53 percent. About 63 percent of all dropouts reported they would be likely to return if school were more interesting. A number of dropouts reported that they might return to school if they thought they could improve their academic skills. Forty percent or more of dropouts reported that they would be likely to return to school if it would improve their reading or math skills, if they were able to take more job-related courses or take classes at night or on weekends, if they could get tutoring or extra help so that they could do better in school, or if they felt they belonged at school. Perhaps reflecting the reasons they originally dropped out, girls were more likely than boys to report access to child care (either a babysitter at home or child care at school) would make them somewhat or very likely to return to school. Girls also were more likely than boys to report that if they could take classes on weekends they would be somewhat or very likely to come back to school. Boys were more likely than girls to report that they would be somewhat or very likely to return to school if they could be involved in sports or other school activities, or if school were more interesting.

Furthermore, some of the most common reasons cited for dropping out were related to their experiences in the schools they left behindincluding a general dislike for school and/or failure in their schoolwork. Given that school failure was the reason so many left, it is interesting to note that over 40 percent reported the opportunity to improve their academic skills as a reason to return to school. About one-third of female dropouts said they left school because they were pregnant. Fittingly, a relatively large proportion of female dropouts said they would be likely to return if they didn't have to support their family, or if they could attend classes at night or on the weekends. The second followup to NELS:88 will be able to examine whether some of these young people do indeed shortly return to finish their high school education. These data will show what proportion of these early dropouts completed or came back to high school by the spring of 1992when this cohort normally would be seniors. The second followup will also examine what proportion of this cohort successfully entered the 11th and/or 12th grade but subsequently dropped out before completion. However, as is shown in the high school completion chapter in this report, many dropouts return and complete high school well into their twenties. Therefore, the final determination of the completion status of the dropouts from the 8th-grade cohort of 1988 must await still further followups to the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "The rate at which students drop out each year and the proportion of dropouts within the young adult population declined over the last decade. The event rate, measured as the percentage of students ages 15-24 dropping out of grades 10-12 each year, declined about two percentage points--from 5.9 percent in 1981 to 4.0 percent in 1991. Grade-and agespecific event dropout rates declined at each grade and age over the last decade. The status rate, measured as the percentage of all 16-24 year olds who had left school without completing high school, fell from approximately 14 percent in 1981 to 12.5 percent in 1991. National, state, county, and city data from the 1990 Decennial Census show considerable variability in status dropout rates considered at the state and local levels, with the rates ranging from 4.3 percent to 19.1 percent at the state level, 2.1 percent to 36.7 percent among large cities, and less than 1 percent to over 50 percent at the county level. Analyses of dropout rates by selected demographic characteristics reveal consistent patterns in 1991 across the three types of national dropout ratesevent, status, and cohort. In particular, male and female dropout rates were comparable, central city rates were higher than suburban rates. The event and status dropout rates decrease markedly as family income goes up, with a tenfold difference between the dropout rates of students from families with low as compared to high incomes. The status dropout rates were the same for whites and blacks within each income level, and Hispanic rates were higher than the rates of whites and blacks. The status rates in the South were higher than those in the Northeast and Midwest and were higher for blacks than for whites. Although the status dropout rate for Hispanics not born in the 50 states or the District of Columbia was higher than the rates for first and at least second generation Hispanics, the Hispanic rates at each generational level were higher than the rates for non-Hispanics at the same level. Even though the data indicate that dropout rates declined over the last decade, it is important to emphasize that the dropout problem is still serious; important subgroup differences persist. As a result, during 1991 students in large numbers continued to drop out of high school without obtaining a diploma or an alternative credential. About 7 percent of the 8th-grade class of 1988 dropped out of school by the spring of 1990, while about 10 percent of black and Hispanic 8th graders dropped out. The number of dropouts is increased multifold when the combined effect of successive years' annual event rates are translated into a status dropout rate. For example, while there were 348,000 \"new\" dropout events among 15-through 24-year-olds in grades 10-12 in 1991, approximately 3.9 million 16-through 24-year-olds did not have a high school diploma and were not enrolled in school. It is not clear where these young people will fit into the modem world of work a world which provides fewer and fewer high wage jobs for low skill people."}, {"section_title": "HIGH SCHOOL COMPLETION AND GRADUATION RATES", "text": "Over the last 20 years the event dropout rate has ranged from a high of 6.7 percent at several points during the 1970s to the current low of 4.0 percent. These data indicate that in each of the last 20 years, between 93 and 96 percent of the 15-through 24-year-olds enrolled in grades 10, 11, or 12 remained in school each year with the goal of continuing their progress toward high school completion (figure 1, appendix table A25). How many students attain that goal? It is important to know what proportion of young people are finishing high school, inasmuch as it is generally agreed that a high school education is a necessary prerequisite to assuming an entry level position in the workforce or military or to continuing on in some formal postsecondary educational program. In addition, the President and the governors included high school completion among their national education goals. Specifically, they called for an increase in the high school graduation rate to at least 90 percent by the year 2000. What Does it Mean to Graduate? There are two major paths to high school completion. Most students receive a regular high school diploma after completing the requisite secondary school coursework. However, other students, regardless of the number of high school courses they have completed, receive an alternative credential such as a General Educational Development (GED) certificate, certificate of completion, or certificate of attendance. Data from the High School and Beyond study show that a substantial number of high school completers hold alternative credentials. For example, in 1986 almost 7 percent of the high school completers from the high school class of 1982 held alternative credentials.35 Strictly speaking, a high school graduation rate is based solely on students receiving regular high school diplomas. Alternatively, a high school completion rate can be calculated by combining data for students receiving regular high school diplomas with data for students receiving alternative credentials."}, {"section_title": "Who Is Included?", "text": "There is also a question of who to include in the base population. Since there are persons well into their 30s and 40s working to complete high school, the age group that is chosen will affect the graduation or completion rate for two reasons. First, students may take longer than the norm to finish high school because they repeat courses or grades, because of illness or injury, or because they started school at an older age than other students. Second, over time, some subset of the dropouts will complete their high school educations. Using an older rather than a younger age group as a base will generally produce higher graduation and completion rates. The proportion of high school students who were older than traditional graduation age varied by sex and raceethnicity (table 21). Males, blacks and Hispanics were more likely to be in high school at age 18 and at age 19 than were females and whites. As a result 35U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, High School and Beyond study, unpublished tabulations. of these differences in enrollment patterns, the age group chosen to define the base for a graduation rate can affect the extent of subgroup differences in completion rates. Only a small number of individuals were still enrolled in school at ages 21 and 22. Thus, the selection of this group as the age reference group for high school graduation and completion minimizes the effect of late enrollments. "}, {"section_title": "Completion and Graduation Rates", "text": "Just as dropout rates can be calculated in various ways, the same is true for graduation and completion rates. The event dropout rate compares the number of students dropping out during a 12-month period to the number of students present at the beginning of the period to measure the proportion of students who drop out in that period without completing high school. The comparable event graduation rate compares the number of students who graduate at the end of a school year (or the following summer) to the number of students eligible to graduate, assuming a successful completion, at the start of the year. Data from the NCES 1987-88 Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) show an event graduation rate of 91.5 percent for graduates in the spring of 1987.36 The cohort dropout rate measures what happens to a single group (or cohort) of students over a period of time by comparing the number of students who have left school prior to completion to the number of students present in the group at the start of the study period in question. The comparable cohort graduation rate compares the number of students who graduate to the number of students present at the start of the study period. While the NELS:88 eighth-grade cohort has not yet reached high school graduation, data from the High School and Beyond 1980 sophomore cohort reveal that 83.4 percent of this cohort graduated on time at the end of their senior year. By 1986, an additional 8.2 percent of the original cohort earned either a high school diploma or the equivalent, for a cohort comp,ztion rate of 91.6 percent.37 The status dropout rate measures the proportion of individuals in a specified kl,e range who are dropouts by comparing the number of persons of those ages who have not completed high school but are not still enrolled to the total number of persons in that age group. The comparable status graduation rate or completion rate compares the number of graduates or completers in a specified age range to the number of persons in that age group. The high school completion rate can be obtained from the status dropout rate and the high school enrollment rate by subtracting the sum of these two rates from 100 percent. Data from the October Current Population Survey (CPS) are used in this section to compute status completion and graduation rates."}, {"section_title": "High School Completion Rates: 1991", "text": "The data in table 22 show the high school completion rate, the school enrollment rate, and the status dropout rate for persons ages 21 and 22 in 1991. These three rates, each expressed as a percentage of the total 21-through 22-year-old population in 1991, sum to 100 percent. In 1991, less than 1 percent (0.6 percent) of the 21-and 22-year-olds were enrolled in high school. Approximately 85.7 percent of this age group had completed their high school education, and the remaining 13.5 percent had dropped out. age group reported completing high school by passing an equivalency test (such as a GED). In 1991, completion and graduation rates for 21-and 22-year-olds were higher for white students than for black and Hispanic students and higher for black students than for Hispanic students. The 21-and 22-year-old age group was selected to minimize the impact of including those still enrolled in high school or a lower grade in the denominator for the high school graduation and completion rates. To the extent that there were still people in this age group enrolled below the college level, their inclusion in the denominator deflate the estimates of the graduation and completion rates for this age group. In this case, the 1991 completion rate for 21-and 22-year-olds changed from 85.7 percent when students still enrolled below the college level were included in the denominator to 86.2 percent when they were excluded (table 24). This problem was more pronounced in younger age groups where the rate of enrollment was higher. The completion rate for 17-and 18-year-olds was only 34.1 percent when students still enrolled were included in the denominator, but increased to 74.2 percent when the rate was computed as a percent of the 17-and 18-year-olds not currently enrolled in high school or below. CPS began differentiating between completers with diplomas as compared to those with alternative credentials in 1988. Therefore, only completion rates can be used to examine trends over time in high school completion. Consequently, estimates of the number and proportion of high school completers in the trend data from CPS will be higher than estimates based solely on measures of regular high school graduates.   1972 1974 1976 1978 1980 1982 1984 19S6 1988 1990 1991 Year SOURCE: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Current Population Survey, October (various years), unpublished data. A cohort approach can be used to evaluate the contribution of late completions to the total completion rate. A comparison of the rate for the 29-and 30-year-olds with the rate for 21-and 22-year-olds 8 years earlier shows the increase in high school completion as this cohort ages. For example, in 1983 the high school completion rate for 21-and 22-year-olds was 83.6 percent, by 1991 the completion rate for this cohort was 85.9 percent (appendix table A41). Trends in the completion rates for white and black 21-through 22-year-olds (figure 11) and 29-through 30-year-olds (figure 12) show larger increases for blacks than for whites, narrowing the difference between the two groups.

Statistical information is collected on public schools, staff, students, and finance. A field test of dropout data collection took place in 27 states and two territories (a total of approximately 300 school districts) during the 1989-90 school year. The data were gathered through administrative records maintained at school districts and schools. The data did not produce national (or state) representative statistics, but instead provided information needed to design a dropout statistics component that was added to the CCD. In that CCD collection, a school dropout was defined as an individual who was enrolled in school at some time during the previous school year, was not enrolled at the beginning of the current school year, has not graduated from high school or completed an approved educational program (event dropouts), and does not meet any of the following exclusionary conditions: death; temporary absence due to suspension or illness; or transfer to another public school district, private school, or a state-or districtapproved education program 4\u00b0F or the purpose of this definition: a school year is the 12-month period of time beginning with the normal opening of school in the fall, with dropouts from the previous summer reported for the year in which they fail to enroll; an individual has graduated from high school or completed an approved education program upon receipt of formal recognition from school authorities; a state-or district-approved education program may include special education programs, home-based instruction, and school-sponsored GED preparation. This new collection was initiated with a set of instructions to State CCD Coordinators in the summer of 1991. Those instructions specified the details of the dropout data to be collected during the 1991-92 school year. These data will be submitted to NCES during the 1992-93 school year, along with expanded reports of the numbers of students of each race-ethnicity by grade of school (dropouts, like graduates, are reported for the preceding school year). Taken together, these data form the basis of the beginning of an annual universebased collection of dropout data for the United States. The results of this first year of dropout data collection will be published in November 1993. It is anticipated that full implementation of this new collection will occur over a period of 3 years. The dropout statistics will make it possible to report the number and rate of event dropouts from public schools by school districts, states, major subpopulations, and the nation. Data will be collected by grade for grades 7-12 and by sex within race-ethnicity categories.

Over 58,000 students (30,000 sophomores) participated in the base-year survey. Students completed questionnaires and took a battery of cognitive tests. Subsamples of the two cohorts were re-surveyed in the springs of 1982 (first followup), 1984 (second followup), and 1986 (third followup).

The purpose of this field test was to examine the feasibility of using a random digit dialing (RDD) and computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) methodology to collect data on in-school and out-of-school experiences of dropouts and to estimate the number and percentage of event and status dropouts. (Status and event dropouts were identified by the same definitions used in CPS.) The field test addressed a number of issues related to the use of NHES methodology for collecting data about dropouts. One major issue was the adequate coverage of the targeted population. Surveys that use the telephone for sampling and data collection fail to cover persons who live in households without telephones, estimn*ed to be about 7 percent of all persons nationwide. If a large percentage of the population is not covered and differences in characteristics between those covered and those not covered are large, the biases from using data collected only from telephone households to estimate the characteristics of the entire population may have important consequences. During the field test, data from the CPS were used to analyze the bias associated with telephone undercoverage. The overall telephone coverage rate for 14-through 21-year-olds was about 92 percent, which is close to the 93 percent coverage for the total population. However, the coverage rate for persons classified as either status or event dropouts was much lower: approximately 70 percent for status dropouts and 75 percent for event dropouts. Moreover, the dropout rates among persons living in the telephone and nontelephone households are quite discrepant. Thus, both conditions necessary for producing significant bias in estimates derived from a survey restricted to telephone households are present. In an effort to increase the sample size and improve the coverage for 14-through 21year -olds, especially dropouts, a random multiplicity sample of 25 percent of all households was selected. In these households, all females 28 through 65 years old were asked to enumerate and complete a Household Respondent Interview (HRI) for each of their 14-through 21-year-old children who did not currently live in their households, as well as for those 14-through 21-year-old children living in the household. The remaining 75 percent of the selected households were asked to only complete HRIs for the 14through 21-year-old children living in the household. The second issue examined was the correspondence between the estimates of dropouts based on information provided by Household Respondents completing the HRI and estimates based on information provided by the 14-through 21-year-olds in Youth Interviews (YI). In general, estimates of dropouts based on information provided by Household Respondents are smaller than similar estimates based on data from the YI for status dropouts. The opposite is true for event dropouts. Also, the relative reporting reliability of the estimates for status dropouts was greater than for event dropouts. Analyses of dropout data from the CPS show that blacks and Hispanics have higher high school dropout rates; thus, the NHES field test oversampled blacks and Hispanics in order to increase the sample size for these groups. Oversampling increased the number of Hispanics in the sample by 34 percent and the number of blacks in the sample by 47 percent. The field test of the NHES has demonstrated that an RDD survey of high school dropouts is feasible if it is carefully planned and executed. However, the potential for bias in the estimates due to telephone undercoverage is an issue which could not be fully resolved in the field test. To acquire information needed to assess the feasibility in the future of collecting dropout data via telephone, a dual frame data collection approach is recommended. The dual frame approach would include both an RDD telephone household survey and an in 1-erson survey with non-telephone households."}, {"section_title": "SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS", "text": "This report has presented data on high school dropout and completion rates in the United States. Three types of dropout rates have been describedevent, status, and cohortas well as several graduation/completion rates. In addition, the report has outlined the status of NCES data collection efforts related to dropouts."}, {"section_title": "Dropout Rates", "text": "Rates. Three types of dropout rates were examined in this report 1) The event dropout rate represents the share of students who leave school without completing high school during a single year. In 1991, the event dropout rate was 4.0 percent for students ages 15 through 24 in grades 10-12. The number of event dropouts from grades 10-12 in 1991 was approximately 348,000. 2) The status dropout rate represents the proportion of individuals at any given time who are not enrolled in school and have not completed high school. In October 1991, 12.5 percent of 16-through 24-year-olds were status dropouts. This represented about 3.9 million persons in this age group who had not completed high school and were not currently enrolled in school. Census data allow a first look at state and local dropout rates. They show considerable variability across states, counties, and large cities. The status dropout rate is a cumulative rate. It is much higher than the event rate because it counts as dropouts all individuals who have not completed high school (and are not currently enrolled in school), regardless of when they last attended school. 3) A third type of dropout ratethe cohort ratemeasures what happens to a single group (or cohort) of students over a period of time. About 7 percent of the eighthgrade cohort of 1988 dropped out of school between the 8th and 10th grades. The cohort dropout rates were about 10 percent for Hispanic and for black students, and they were higher than the rates for whites and Asians. Trend. Nationally, dropout rates have been declining. The event rate declined 34 percent between 1980 and 1991, from 6.1 percent to 4.0 percent. The status rate in 1991 was about 11 percent lower than it had been in 1980: 14.1 percent in 1980 and 12.5 percent in 1991. Dropout rates have been declining for blacks and whites but not for Hispanics. The event dropout rates for whites and blacks declined between 1980 and 1991. The status dropout rates for 16-through 24-year-old blacks have declined considerably since 1972 (from 21.3 percent in 1972 to 13.6 percent in 1991), and the rates for 16-through 24-yearold whites have also decreased (from 12.3 percent in 1972 to 8.9 percent in 1991). The decline for the black status rate occurred within all levels of current family incomelow, middle, and high. Thus, the differences between the status dropout rates for whites and blacks have narrowed over the two decades: from a difference of about 9.0 percentage points in 1972 to a difference of 4.7 percentage points in 1991. Hispanic dropout rates-event and statushave shown no consistent trend, but have remained high throughout the last 20 years."}, {"section_title": "High School Completion and Graduation", "text": "High school completion rates at different age levels reflect different sets of experiences. At ages 17-18, a number of students are still enrolled in school, and as a result only about one-third have completed high school. Fewer than 10 percent of the 19and 20-year-olds were still enrolled in high school in 1991, and about 82 percent of this age group had completed high school. The 21-and 22-year-old age group was used to summarize the high school completion rates across racial and ethnic groups, given that less than 1 percent of this group were still enrolled in high school. The high school completion rate for 21-and 22-year-olds in 1991 was 85.7 percent, and 95 percent of those students held a regular diploma; the remaining 5 percent of the high school completers (4.3 percent of all 21-and 22-year-olds) received some type of alternative credential. Taken as a group, the 85.7 percent completion rate for 21-and 22-year-olds suggests that the United States is well on the way to achieving the year 2000 high school graduation rate goal of 90 percent. However, when race and ethnicity are taken into account, the prospect is not as encouraging. Although the rate for white students was 90 percent, the rate for black students was 81 percent, and the rate for Hispanic students was 61 percent. Over the last two decades, the high school completion rate for all 21-and 22-yearolds showed a modest increasefrom approximately 82 percent in 1972 to the current -ate of close to 86 percent. During this time interval, the completion rates for blacks and whites ages 21 and 22 both increased (7 percentage points for blacks and 5 percentage points for whites), and the rates for Hispanics fluctuated around the 60 percent rate observed in 1991. High school completion rates were also examined in detail for 29-and 30-year-olds to capture the effects of late completers on high school completion. In general, while the gains experienced by this age group were larger than those observed for 21-and 22-year-olds, they stopped in 1984. Since that time, the rates for the group as a whole and for whites and blacks (and Hispanics) have shown no trend. The rates for the group as a whole, and for whites, increased 10 percent from 1972 to 1984; the rate for black 29-and 30-year-olds increased 27 percent; and the rate for Hispanics showed no trend."}, {"section_title": "New Data Sources", "text": "The data presented in this report on dropout and high school completion rates provide important insights for educators and policymakers. However, there are several weaknesses in these data. For example, the sample sizes in CPS may result in imprecise estimates of dropout and completion rates for important subgroups, including subregional areas and some minority subpopulations. Furthermore, the cross-sectional nature of the data does not allow the examination of factors that lead to dropping out of school and its consequences. Therefore, NCES is working to improve the availability of reliable and policy-relevant data on dropouts. The Common Core of Data (CCD) field tested a dropout data collection in 27 states and two territories. The collection of dropout data through the CCD will make it possible to report the number and rate of event dropouts from grades 7-12 for public schools by school districts, states, the nation, and major subpopulations. Furthermore, several other surveys, including the National Household Education Survey and planned followups of the National Education Longitudinal Survey of 1988 and the High School and Beyond study, can provide additional sources of data on dropouts and high school completers in the future. In particular, data from the two longitudinal studies will provide important data needed to monitor the percentage of dropouts who successfully complete a high school diploma or its equivalent."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Over the last 20 years, there has been a general decline in dropout rates and a general increase in high school completion rates. Between the years 1980 and 1991 alone, event rates declined 34 percent and status rates have declined 11 percent. Between 1972 and 1991, completion rates increased for 21-and 22-year-olds by about 4 percent. Moreover, the dropout rates for black young people have shown the greatest progress over the last two decades, thus narrowing the gap between the proportion of white and black students dropping out of school, However, notwithstanding these gains, dropout rates remain at unacceptable levels with too many students leaving school without earning their high school diplomas. In 1991, approximately 348 thousand students age 15 through 24 dropped out of high school. Over 3.9 million persons ages 16 through 24 had not completed high school and were not currently enrolled in school. Dropout and non-completion rates were particularly high for Hispanics, and for those in the central city. Furthermore, despite the fact that current family income may be an effect of dropping out rather than a cause, persons currently residing in low income families have dropout rates that are much higher than those of persons living in high income families. Without a high school diploma or equivalency certificate, these young people, already economically disadvantaged, face further disadvantages in the global economy.                                           Whether students entering the military or correctional institutions are considered dropouts; Whether those in GED programs or with an equivalency certificate are considered dropouts; Whether those not graduating with their class (but never leaving school) are considered dropouts; and Whether those leaving high school early to enter college are considered dropouts. There are variations in the dropout definitions embedded in the existing data sourcesCPS, HS&B, and NELS:88; in addition the age or grade span examined and the type of dropout ratestatus, event, or cohortvaries across the data sources. Furthermore, as outlined below, there have been changes in CPS procedures in 1986 and 1988. While the new collection through the NCES Common Core of Data (CCD) is designed to be consistent with the current CPS procedures, the CCD will include all dropouts in grades 7 to 12 versus 10 to 12 and will be based on administrative records rather than a household survey. Thus, there will be some discontinuities in dropout reporting as the new and more consistent data become available. Table B1 displays the full array of the components of a dropout data system.

CPS is a nationally representative sample survey of all households. The survey is conducted in approximately 60,000 dwelling units in 729 primary sampling units. Dwelling units are insample for four successive monthly interviews, out-of-sample for the next 8 months, and then returned to the sample for the following four months. An adult member of each household serves as the informant for that household. Data for each member of the household are supplied by the informant. In addition, supplementary questions regarding school enrollment are asked about eligible household members 3 years old and over. Some interviews are conducted by telephone. The sampling frame is a complete list of dwelling-unit addresses at the Census updated by demolitions and new construction and field listings. The population surveyed excludes members of the Armed Forces, inmates of correctional institutions, and patients in long-term medical or custodial facilities; it is referred to as the civilian, non-institutionalized population. Typically, about four percent of dwelling units are not interviewed, because occupants are not at home after repeated callbacks, or for some other reason. The October Supplement obtains information about school enrollment and educational attainment for each member of a household. To identify dropout events, it also asks about enrollment one year prior to the interview. From CPS it is possible to obtain the number and proportion of dropouts, defined either as an event or a status, and some information about the characteristics of dropouts. A variety of questionnaire items are used in calculating these dropout rates, including:"}, {"section_title": "attending or enrolled in regular school?", "text": "What grade or year is ... attending? Was ... attending or enrolled in a regular school or college in October, 199-, that is of October of last year? What grade or year was ... attending last year? What is the highest grade or year ... has attended? Did ... complete that grade? Based on the responses of the household informant to these items, event dropouts are defined as those 15-through 24-year-olds not currently enrolled in school, who were enrolled a year ago and are not high school graduates. To calculate an event rate using CPS, the number of dropouts is divided by an estimate (obtained this October) of the number of students enrolled the previous October. This estimate is the sum of those students who completed the previous grade last year and are enrolled in high school or below this October or completed high school plus those students who were enrolled last year, are not currently enrolled in school, but did not complete high school. The dropout interval is defined to include the previous summer and the current school year. That is, once a grade is completed, the student is then at-risk of dropping out of the next grade. What is not captured in the CPS rate is students who drop out and return to school within the 12-month period and students who enrolled after the first week of October the previous year. The definition being field tested in the Common Core of Data (CCD) by NCES includes all students enrolled at any time during the previous school year. The November 1989 CPS supplement contained items pertaining to nativity and language usage of household members. An item on school enrollment is asked every month. Therefore, status dropout rates (the proportion of an age group out of school and not completed high school) can be calculated every month, including November. (Event dropout rates, which represent the proportion of students who have dropped out over a 12month period, can only be calculated in October.) The limitations of CPS as a data source on dropouts stem from the size of the sample and the survey's broad scope. Because CPS collects no information on school characteristics and experiences, its uses in addressing dropout issues are primarily for providing some insights into who drops out and estimating national dropout rates. It is also the only source of time series data on dropout rates. Data are available since 1967 to calculate event rates and earlier for status rates. In previous years, CPS asked the question on enrollment the previous October about individuals 14 years old and older. As of October 1989, CPS asks this question only about individuals 15 years old and older. This report focuses on event dropout rates for secondary school students 15 through 24 years of age who dropped out of grades 10 to 12. Included in the grade 10 to 12 event rate are students in the 15-through 24-year-old age range who completed the 9th grade the previous year, but did not return in the fall to begin the 10th grade. The status dropout rates in this report include all persons 16 through 24 years old who have not completed high school and are not currently enrolled in school. Beginning with 1986, to improve the quality of the data the Bureau of the Census has instituted new editing procedures for cases with missing data on school enrollment items. The effect of the editing changes for 1986, a bridge year in which the data were edited using both the old and new procedures, was to increase the number of students enrolled in school and decrease the number of students enrolled last year but not enrolled in the current year. The new editing procedures lowered the 1986 event rate for grades 10-12, ages 14 through 24, by about 0.4 percent, from 4.69 to 4.28 percent. While a difference of 0.4 percent is large relative to the observed year-to-year changes in the event rate, it is not statistically significant. The changes in the editing procedures made less difference in the status dropout rates for 16-through 24-year-olds-12.2 percent based on the old procedures and 12.1 percent based on the new."}, {"section_title": "Definition of family income in CPS", "text": "Family income is derived from a single question asked of the household respondent. Income includes money income from all sources including jobs, business, interest, rent, social security payments, etc. The income of nonrelatives living in the household is excluded, but the income of all family members 14 years old and over, including those temporarily living away, is included. Family income refers to receipts over a 12-month period. Income for families from which no income information was obtained (about 5 percent of families) was imputed. A sequential hotdeck procedure was used. A total of 200 imputation classes were created-5 levels of the age of head of household by S levels of the education of the head of household by 2 levels for the employment status of the head of household, and 4 levels of the number of workers in the household. To minimize the multiple use of a single donor, up to 5 donors were placed in each imputation class. A donor was selected at random from these when a family with missing income information was encountered. In a few instances (about 10 of 50,000 families in each year) an imputation class had no donors but a family from the class with missing income information was encountered. In these cases a donor was selected by collapsing similar classes until a nonempty imputation class was created. To facilitate comparisons over time, the categorical family income information was transformed into a continuous family income variable. The transformation was accomplished by randomly assigning for each family an income value from the income interval to which their income belonged. For intervals below the median a rectangular probability density function was used; for those above the median a Pareto probability tensity function was used. The methodology has a feature that if the continuous family income variable were transformed back to a categorical family income variable, the value for each family would be identical to the original data. Based on the continuous family income variable, a family income percentile variable is calculated for each person in the survey which represents that person's position in the family income distribution. For example, if 25 percent of all persons have a lower value of family income (and 75 percent have a higher value), then the person's family income percentile variable has a value of 25. The methodology gives all persons in the same household the same value of both the categorical and continuous versions of family income. There are several issues that affect the interpretation of dropout rates by family income using the CPS. First, it is possible that the family income of the student at the time they dropped out was somewhat different than their current family income. (The problem is potentially greatest with status dropouts who could have dropped out several years ago.) Furthermore, family income is from a single question asked of the household respondent in the October CPS. In some cases, there are persons 15 through 24 years old living in the household that are unrelated to the household respondent, yet whose family income is defined as the income of the family of the household respondent. Therefore, the current household income of the respondent may not accurately reflect that person's family background. In particular, in 1991 some of the dropouts in the 15 through 24 year age range were not still living in a family unit with a parent present. However, an analysis of 1991 status dropout rates by family income, race-ethnicity, and family status (presence of parent in the household) indicates that the bias introduced by persons not living in their parent's household is small (table B2). For example, while only 62 percent of 16-through 24-year olds lived with a least one parent, the status dropout rates for Hack and white persons were similar with or without the parent present. For example, 20.6 percent of low income blacks without a parent present were dropouts compared with 21.3 percent in their parent's household. In addition, the relationship between dropout rates and income held within each racial category regardless of whether the person was living in a household with their parent. That is, blacks and whites within income levels dropped out at similar levels with or without the parent present. (However, this was not true of Hispanics. Hispanics in upper income levels and not residing with either parent were more likely to be status dropouts.) Defining and calculating status dropout rates using the 1990 Decennial Census The 1990 Decennial Census data used in computing status dropout rates for states, counties, and large cities are from a special tabulation of the Census sample detail file. That file includes data on current high school enrollment and high school graduation status for persons ages 16 through 19. Those data were used in conjunction with Census single year of age population data. By definition, the status dropout rate for 16-through 19-year-olds is computed as the percent of all 16-through 19-year-olds who are not currently enrolled in high school and have not graduated from high school. The Census data collection procedures count each person at their current location. As a result, 16-through 19-year-olds who graduated from high school and moved to another location for college or work are counted at their new location. This has the potential for decreasing the dropout rate in areas with universities, colleges, or employment opportunities (because of the influx of 16-through 19-year-olds), and potentially increasing the dropout rate in areas that graduates leave. To the extent that the dropout rate for a geographic unit is viewed as an outcome of students' progress through that location's educational system, it is essential that the population base for the rate is representative of the size of the population that is at risk of dropping out in that area. The population ages 14 through 17 in each geographic area can be used in the denominator to better capture the size of the population at risk of dropping out of school in that area. This population, ratio adjusted to the size of the national 16-through 19-year-old population, can be used to estimate the 16-through 19-year-old population to avoid distortion of the dropout rates by post-graduate movements. For example, Arizona State University is in Tempe, Arizona; when the 16-through 19-year-olds in Tempe who have not graduated from high school and are not enrolled in school are expressed as a percent of the actual number of 16-through 19-year-olds in Tempe, the high school dropout rate is 5.8 percent. When the ratio adjusted 14-through 17-year-old population is used to estimate the 16-through 19-year-old population that was at risk of dropping out of school in Tempe, the dropout rate increases to 9.5 percent."}, {"section_title": "Defining and calculating event droput rates using NELS:88", "text": "The NELS:88 baseline comprised a national probability sample of all regular public and private 8th-grade schools in the 50 states and District of Columbia in the 1987-88 school year. Excluded from the NELS:88 sample were Bureau of Indian Affairs schools, special education schools for the handicapped, area vocational schools that do not enroll students directly, and schools for dependents of U.S. personnel overseas; such schoollevel exclusions have a quite small impact on national estimates. As reported earlier, data on the education outcomes of a representative sample of the base-year ineligible students were added to comparable data from the base-year respondents for the computation of nationally representative cohort dropout rates. Thus the cohort dropout rates in this report reflect the full student population of 8th-grade schools in the United States in the spring of 1988 as represented through the 1,052 participating schools in the NELS:88 Base Year. Missing from the cohort rate for grades 8 to 10 is anyone who had dropped out prior to the spring of their eighth-grade year. Thus, the overall cohort rate reported here may be lower than it would have been if a younger cohort were used. This may be particularly important for Hispanics, given that CPS data show that Hispanic dropouts tend to have completed less schooling than other dropouts. The cohort rates also reflect the school enrollment status of both eligible and ineligible nonparticipants and participants, to the extent that this information could be obtained. The following definition of a dropout was employed in NELS:88: 1. an individual who, according to the school (if the sample member could not be located), or according to the school and home, is not attending school (= has not 'ieen in school for 4 consecutive weeks or more and is not absent due to accident or illness); or 2. a student who has been in school less than 2 weeks after a period in which he or she was classified as a dropout. Thus, a student who was temporary dropout (stopout) who was found by the study to be out of school for 4 consecutive school weeks or more and had returned to school (that is, had been back in school for a period of at least 2 weeks at the time of survey administration in the spring of 1990) would not be classified as a dropout for purposes of the cohort dropout rates reported here. The basic NELS:88 procedure for identification of a dropout was to confirm schoolreported dropout status with the student's household. For the current, preliminary table, information on dropout status was obtained first from the school and then confirmed with the household for 96.4 percent of the dropouts. Thus only 3.6 percent of the dropouts were identified by only school-reported information."}, {"section_title": "Accuracy of Estimates", "text": "The estimates in this report are derived from samples and are subject to two broad classes of error sampling and noasampling error. Sampling errors occur because the data are collected from a sample of a population rather than from the entire population. Estimates based on a sample will differ somewhat from the values that would have been obtained from a universe survey using the same instruments, instructions, and procedures. Nonsampling errors come from a variety of sources and affect all types of surveys, universe as well as sample surveys. Examples of sources of nonsampling error include design, reporting, and processing errors and errors due to nonresponse. The effects of nonsampling errors are more difficult to evaluate than those that result from sampling variability. As much as possible, procedures are built into surveys in order to minimize nonsampling errors. The standard error is a measure of the variability due to sampling when estimating a parameter. It indicates how much variance there is in the population of possible estimates of a parameter for a given sample size. Standard errors can be used as a measure of the precision expected from a particular sample. The probability that a complete census would differ from the sample by less than the standard error is about 68 out of 100. The chances that the difference would be less than 1.65 times the standard error are about 90 out of 100; that the difference would be less than 1.96 the standard error, about 95 out of 100. Standard errors for rates and number of persons based on CPS data were calculated using the following formulas: Dropout rate: where p = the percentage (0 < p < 100), N = the population on which the percentage is based, and b = the parameter associated with the characteristic; b is equal to 2,532 for the total or white population; 3,425 for the black population; and 5772 for the Hispanic population ages 14 through 34 years old."}, {"section_title": "Number of persons", "text": "s.e. = q(bx)(1 -x/T), where x = the number of persons (i.e., dropouts), T = population in the category (i.e., blacks 16 through 24), and b = as above. Standard errors for many of the estimates in the tables appear in appendix A. In October of 1991, the Bureau of the Census released new b parameters for 1988 and 1990. (Recently new parameters also have been released for the 1991 data.) With the release of the new parameters, the Census Bureau also made adjustments to the parameters for earlier years. Therefore, for some years, the standard errors presented in the appendix cables here are different than the standard errors presented in earlier reports."}, {"section_title": "Methodology and Statistical Procedures", "text": "The comparisons in the text have all been tested for statistical significance to ensure that the differences are larger than those that might be expected due to sampling variation. Two types of comparisons have been made in the text. Differences in two estimated percentages. The Student's t statistic can be used to test the likelihood that the differences between two percentages are larger than would be expected by sampling error."}, {"section_title": "t=", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "PrP2", "text": "1jse12 + se22 where P1 and P2 are the estimates to be compared and sei and set are their corresponding standard errors. As the number of comparisons on the same set of data increases, the likelihood that the t value for at least one of the comparisons will exceed 1.96 simply due to sampling error increases. For a single comparison, there is a 5 percent chance that the t value will exceed 1.96 due to sampling error. For five tests, the risk of getting at least one t value that high increases to 23 percent and for 20 comparisons, 64 percent. One way to compensate for this danger when making multiple comparisons is to adjust the alpha level to take into account the number of comparisons being made. For example, rather than establishing an alpha level of 0.05 for a single comparison, the alpha level is set to ensure that the likelihood is less than 0.05 that the t value for any of the comparisons exceeds the critical value by chance alone when there are truly no differences for any of the comparisons. This Bonferroni adjustment is calculated by taking the desired alpha level and dividing by the number of possible comparisons, based on the variable(s) being compared. The t value corresponding to the revised, lower alpha level must be exceeded in order for any of the comparisons to be considered significant. For example, to test for differences in dropout rates between whites, blacks, and Hispanics, the following steps would be involved: Establish the number of comparisons in this case three (whites and blacks; whites and Hispanics; and blacks and Hispanics). The number of two-way comparisons that can be made equals f(n)(n-1)1/2, where n is the number of variable categories. Thus, with three categories the number of possible comparisons is [(3)(2)1/2 = 3. Divide the desired alpha level, 0.05, by the number of comparisons (e.g. three) to obtain the new alpha level (0.05/3 = 0.0166). Consult a table of t statistics (or the standard normal table for z values if the N is large) to find the t value that corresponds to that alpha (t = 2.39 for alpha = 0.0166). All comparisons in this report were tested using the Bonferroni adjustment for the t tests. Where categories of two variables were involved, the number of comparisons used to make the Bonferroni adjustment was based on the relationship(s) being tested. Trends. Regression analysis was used to test for trends across age groups and over time. Regression analysis assesses the degree to which one variable (the dependent variable) is related to a set of other variables (the independent variables). The estimation procedure most commonly used in regression analysis is ordinary least squares (OLS). The analyses in this report were conducted on the event rates and the status rates. The event rate and status rate estimates were used as dependent measures in the analysis with a variable representing time and a dummy variable controlling for changes in the editing procedure (0 = years 1968 to 1986, 1 = 1987 to 1991) used as independent variables. However, in these data some of the observations viere less reliable than others (i.e, some year's standard errors were larger than other year's). In such cases OLS estimation procedures do not apply and it is necessary to modify the regression procedures to obtain unbiased regression parameters. The modification that is usually recommended transforms the observations to variables which satisfy the usual assumptions of ordinary least squares regression and then applies the usual OLS analysis to these variables. This was done in this analysis using the data manipulation and regression capability of LOTUS 1-2-3. Each of the variables in the analysis were transformed by dividing each by the standard error of the relevant year's rate (event or status). The new dependent variable was then regressed on the new time variable and new editing-change dummy variable. All statements about trends in this report are statistically significant at the 0.05 level.       "}]
