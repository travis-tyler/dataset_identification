[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In the world of ocean and coastal resource management, street centerline information is not nearly as critical as is accurate bathymetry on a nautical chart. The \"framework\" spatial information of the coastal and ocean resource management community is very different from the terrestrial framework as described and promulgated in several Executive Orders and Federal decision documents. The NSDI was originally defined in a National Research Council report, Toward a Coordinated Spatial Data Infrastructure for the Nation (NRC, 1993), as \"the total ensemble of geographic information at our disposal that describes the arrangement and attributes of features and phenomena on the Earth, as well as the materials, technology, and people necessary to acquire, process, store, and distribute such information to meet a wide variety of needs.\" Over the intervening decade, the definition in practice has evolved to include the policies, people, data, data standards, data distribution, and resulting decision-making support applications. The National Map is one component of the USGS's contribution to the NSDI. This effort will be achieved by working in partnership with the"}, {"section_title": "Digital Coast and The National Map:", "text": "A Seamless Cooperative Margaret A. Davidson and Anne Hale Miglarese many segments of society that have come to rely on spatial data in its past, present, and ever-evolving forms. The National Map will be an important component of the information needed by the coastal and ocean management community. However, this community also requires a vast collection of data covering the 80 percent of the Earth's surface that will not be included in The National Map. Therefore, NOAA and other Federal, state, and local organizations will need to work in concert to create information fundamental to their mission requirements. This corollary effort within NOAA is termed the Digital Coast. Digital Coast is a Federal-statelocal partnership to develop an information framework for addressing coastal and ocean issues (Plate 1). Digital Coast will provide organized, timely, and seamless digital geographic information that the economic, natural resource, coastal management, and ports and navigation communities need to make informed decisions about coastal and ocean regions. Digital Coast within NOAA will focus on three of the five fundamental components of the Coastal NSDI: data standards, data development, and data distribution. In order for the Digital Coast to be useful and stand the test of time, information must be documented, current, consistent, and easily accessible through the Internet. Partners will incorporate standard collection protocols so that organizations can collect and share data, minimize duplicative efforts, and maximize the return on Federal, state, and local investments. Coastal decision makers are under substantial pressure to balance the needs of environmental protection and sustainable growth. All levels of government are becoming increasingly dependent on digital spatial data and information to manage economic and natural resources, as well as the conflicting interests of constituents. An improved, widely available spatial information infrastructure is needed to provide the framework for addressing these issues. The information needed to support the decision-making process, though, does not begin or end at the shoreline. The Digital Coast and The National Map must be integrated across physical and institutional boundaries to be of the greatest utility. Specifically, the integration of elevation, land cover, shoreline, and hydrologic unit boundaries must be accomplished within the two initiatives."}, {"section_title": "Digital Coast: Defining Coastal Framework Data", "text": "In an attempt to quantify the spatial data needs of the coastal resource management community, the NOAA Coastal Services Center conducts a user survey of the community every three years. The results of this survey are used to inform NOAA's data acquisition and project selection process. In the fall of 2002, 223 coastal resource management professionals from all 34 coastal states and territories responded to the survey. The survey response rate was 71 percent. The survey provides insights into what data comprise the Digital Coast, what resource management issues are addressed in part through the use of geographic information systems (GIS), and the level of investment state and local resource agencies are allocating to the use of spatial technologies. To view the survey on-line, visit www.csc.noaa.gov. When asked what priority activities were facing the agencies in the next three years, \"increased access to information and technology\" was ranked \"high\" by 70 percent of the respondents. Additionally, \"increasing the agencies' knowledge of spatial data, technology, and their application\" was ranked \"high\" by 68 percent of those polled. The need for this technology is driven by the managers' need to \"increase public involvement in coastal decision making,\" ranked \"high\" by 61 percent and to \"support their outreach and education activities,\" 71 percent. When asked to define the applications of spatial technologies within their decision-making framework, water quality applications received the highest frequency of responses. Fifty-one percent of the respondents ranked using spatial data to manage their non-point-source activities as a high priority. Forty-six percent of these agencies responded similarly when questioned about water quality monitoring. Ecosystem management activities at the state level are also driving the need for coastal spatial data. Sixty-one percent of the agencies use spatial data in their habitat restoration and monitoring activities. Similarly, 53 percent use spatial data to address protected areas management decision making. Coastal development management and planning, not surprisingly, is also driving the development of spatial data at the state and local level. Watershed planning, growth management, and floodplain management applications all ranked high among the needs of coastal resource managers for the use of spatial technologies. When respondents were asked to rank the value of specific spatial data within the coastal watershed and nearshore (0 to 3 miles (4.8 km)) environment, consistent responses have been expressed over the three individual surveys to date (1997, 1999, and 2002). The respondents were asked to rank the decision-making value of access to 31 specific data themes within the coastal management context. The rankings and responses for the \"coastal framework themes\" are presented in Table 1. Table 2 is a list of all other themes the respondents were asked to rank. State and local governments are primarily concerned with the land-based activities within their jurisdiction and from the shoreline out to the three-mile state jurisdictional line. Their interest in spatial data and applications falls off significantly outside of the three-mile boundary, with only a few exceptions. Eighty-five percent of the agencies responding to the survey presently use GIS in their everyday business practice. Seventy percent of these agencies have between one and five employees using GIS daily. Just over 90 percent of the agencies use some form of Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) software. Only 28 percent of the respondents' organizations used an Internet-based clearinghouse to distribute their spatial data holdings. Thirty-four percent distributed data via digital media such as CD-ROM or tape. Twenty-seven percent never distribute their data digitally. When asked what the biggest impediments were to making data available, the strongest response was they lacked the time necessary to prioritize this activity (32 percent) and the skill for implementation (20 percent). Finally, when inquiring about the use of metadata, the results were far from encouraging. Thirty-two percent of the agencies do not create metadata for their information, 37 percent of the respondents did not know the answer to this question for their agency, and only 21 percent created FGDCcompliant metadata. Of these, only one agency hosted an FGDC node. Through the Digital Coast initiative, NOAA will ardently support the development of FGDC-compliant metadata and the development of FGDC clearinghouse nodes for the distribution of these data. Additionally, NOAA is supporting the Department of Interior E-Gov initiative, Geospatial One-Stop, and will make all of the Digital Coast accessible through this and other portals."}, {"section_title": "Data Standards Development", "text": "Developing spatial data content, accuracy, and metadata standards is an important process that is often avoided by organizations and individuals alike. Experience shows that well-meaning administrators often put junior staff in the Fortunately, humans have been mapping the sea since the onset of navigation, and mariners learned long ago that hydrographic data standards were fundamental to the movement of commerce across the Earth's oceans. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), established in 1921, sets the international standards for nautical charting and hydrographic surveys. The standards of particular importance to the worldwide charting community are S-44, IHO Standards for Hydrographic Surveys; S-52, Specifications for Chart Content and Display Aspects of ECDIS; and S-57, IHO Transfer Standard for Digital Hydrographic Data. These standards specify the data structure, content, display, and accuracy of Electronic Navigational Charts (ENCs) and hydrographic data. Many additional standards are required that are unique to the coastal mapping community. NOAA is working through the various subcommittees of the Federal Geographic Data Committee to develop and implement consensus-based standards for the shoreline, marine boundaries, and bathymetry. Two of the subcommittees that are particularly active are the Marine and Coastal Spatial Data Subcommittee and the Marine Boundary Working Group."}, {"section_title": "The Land Sea Interface: Edge Matching The National Map and the Digital Coast", "text": "Assuming state and Federal agencies can make the case to fully fund the acquisition of the data to make the National Map and the Digital Coast a reality, this alone would not solve our problem of a seamless interface between the land and sea. The problem of integrating across the zero contour line at the ocean interface is one of vertical datums. Vertical datums come in three categories: those based on a form of Mean Sea Level (MSL), called Orthometric Datums; those based on tidally derived surfaces of high or low water, called Tidal Datums; and three-dimensional (3D) datums realized through space-based systems such as the Global Positioning System (GPS). Topographic maps from the USGS generally have elevations referenced to an Orthometric datum, either the North American Vertical Datum 1988 (NAVD 88) or the older National Geodetic Vertical Datum 1929 (NGVD 29). The NAVD 88 was affirmed as the official vertical datum for the United States on 24 June 1993. Nautical charts have depths referenced to different tidal datums, which can vary from chart to chart. In the United States, mean lower low water (MLLW) is the official NOAA Chart datum. To support harbor and river navigation, bridge clearances are referenced to a mean high water (MHW), and not MLLW. In order for The National Map and the Digital Coast to meet at this continuous surface, the datum issue must be overcome. NOAA's Office of Coast Survey, in coordination with the Geography Discipline of the USGS, has undertaken several pilot studies to develop the procedures to make this possible. These pilots have been called \"topo-bathy.\" They have been successful in developing the V-Datum tool for the datum transformation (Plate 2). V-Datum transforms elevation information from one vertical datum into another datum. Such transformations are necessary when data from diverse sources are to be combined or compared. Informally, a datum can be considered the arbitrary zero level of the vertical coordinate of geospatial data. Artificial steps or discontinuities can appear in maps and charts if they are built from data based on inconsistent datums, and this problem can be particularly acute in coastal areas. In Tampa Bay, the separation of the tidal surfaces and the North American Datum 1983 is in excess of 24 meters. This work must be extended throughout the coastal regions of the U.S. if a seamless integration of the land-sea interface is ever to be accomplished in the NSDI. For more information on vertical datums and the topo-bathy integration work visit http://chartmaker.ncd.noaa.gov:80/bathytopo/vdatum.htm and http://chartmaker.ncd.noaa.gov/bathytopo/, respectively."}, {"section_title": "The U.S. Shoreline", "text": "Compounding the difficulties in generating a consistent vertical surface across the land-water interface is the fact that there are numerous definitions of the term, and resulting vector feature, \"shoreline.\" Countless different shoreline definitions are in use by Federal, state, and local authorities (Figure 1). NOAA nautical charts depict the mean high water (MHW) shoreline and the mean lower low water (MLLW) shoreline; the USGS topographic quadrangle sheet and The National Map shoreline are not tide referenced and represent the shoreline at the time of photogrammetric data collection. Coastal states also define their official shorelines differently. The official U.S. legal shoreline is an important international, national, state, and local boundary. Its precise definition should not be underestimated from a technical, legal, and economic standpoint. The use of inconsistent shoreline definitions between maps, charts, GIS, and other products has considerable potential for confusion. This unfortunate reality has largely been a function of mapping production schedules and end-user needs. However, in the future represented by The National Map and the Digital Coast this error no longer need be propagated. Because the definitions of shoreline are typically related to water levels, the shoreline is dynamic, changing over time and spatial scales. With an ellipsoid-referenced digital elevation model and appropriate tidal models, agencies can adopt common and consistent horizontal and vertical reference datums and have the ability to transform and integrate shoreline definition within this common framework, depending on their legal requirements. This transformation in the way shoreline is captured and portrayed in spatial data can be made possible by the V-Datum tool mentioned previously and the collection of high-resolution intertidal elevation information."}, {"section_title": "PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING & REMOTE SENSING", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Coastal Elevation Information", "text": "Perhaps the most fundamental spatial data sets required to run important life-saving decision-support models is coastal topography. This information is used in developing hurricane flood inundation models and maps. Critical decisions must be made at the state and local level in a rapid fashion, and the results of the analyses drive hurricane evacuation efforts. The impact of these decisions to individuals, societies, and economies are profound. Additionally, the entire geospatial community is waiting to see the substantial improvement to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) in North Carolina and their resulting information products to support Federal, state, and local decision makers in times of inland and coastal flooding. It is anticipated that these improved products will save lives, time, and money, a true test of the value of spatial decision support. The improvements in spatial technology are perhaps most apparent in the realm of elevation mapping. Highly accurate elevation information is now affordable in a timely manner with the commercialization of Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (IfSAR) technology. For more than 100 years, the USGS has collected elevation information across the Nation, including the coastal zone. Elevation is a framework data set described within Circular A-16. USGS is the steward of this information and manages its outreach and coordination efforts through the National Digital Elevation Program (NDEP). NOAA is an active participant in NDEP and coordinates its elevation collection activities through NDEP. It is an unfortunate reality that the USGS budget will not fund the collection of high accuracy elevation data for the entire country. USGS, however, has been working with partners to assimilate data collected by others into The National Map. NOAA has prioritized the collection of topographic lidar and IfSAR data for the coastal counties of the U.S. NOAA will fund the activities in partnership with others whenever possible and contribute the resulting information to The National Map. With further collaboration with FEMA and its recently increased budget for modernizing the FIRM maps, and with the Army Corp of Engineers, significant progress can be made in contributing to the development of the elevation content of The National Map. In addition, if flight plans for the collection of this information by others can accommodate low tide acquisition, this intertidal elevation model can contribute to the accurate definition of shoreline as described earlier."}, {"section_title": "Coastal Land Cover", "text": "When referencing any community's framework data, there is a consistent need for land-use and land-cover information. NOAA, through its Coastal Change Analysis Program, has been developing coastal land-cover information for a decade. The primary concern of the program is to monitor the coastal zones for development and to evaluate the location, extent, and conversion of coastal wetlands. The program was recently reengineered to improve its mapping protocols as well as its production cycle. The work of interpreting Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery is now done entirely within the private sector. For these reasons, the productivity of the program has increased dramatically. Within the past two years the program has been able to map the entire coastal zone of the Great Lakes and Pacific Coast. In 2003 the program is mapping the estuarine drainage areas of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. After the program retooling, and from the program's experience as a member of the Multi Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MRLC), it is evident that greater efficiency could be gained by working more closely with the USGS and its land-cover program. NOAA and USGS staff, through a series of meetings in the winter and spring of 2003, have proposed greater collaboration to enhance both efforts. The suggestions range from adopting the same classification scheme and processing techniques to merging the programs into one landcover mapping initiative. Under the latter scenario, NOAA would take the responsibility for producing all of the landcover products within the coastal zone and USGS would focus on all inland areas. While the final decisions on the exact nature of this collaboration have not yet been made, the effort to eliminate redundancy and to improve both programs will succeed. The information derived from these efforts will feed both The National Map and Digital Coast."}, {"section_title": "Integrated Coastal Ocean Observations", "text": "The Integrated Coastal Ocean Observing System is a concept developed over the past decade by national government, academic research, and international organizations. It is envisioned as a network of linked and coordinated monitoring and observing programs, that will provide a basic set of oceanographic and environmental data and predictions to the coastal research and management communities. Operational oceanography can be defined as the activity of systematic and longterm routine measurements of the seas and oceans and atmosphere, and their rapid interpretation and dissemination. NOAA is working in concert with OCEANS.US to develop the backbone of this coastal observing system and to integrate the operational data collection and dissemination activities within the Digital Coast construct (for more information, see www.ocean.us)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "There are many commonalities between The National Map and the Digital Coast. Both of these initiatives require much of the exact same data, the goodwill and full participation of a host of partners at the state and local levels, and the full support of numerous Federal organizations. It is apparent that the work required to build these information initiatives will be long and hard, although it seems that the challenges that lay ahead are no longer primarily technical in nature. The required institutional coordination, collaboration, and communication to build these decision-support systems have rarely been exhibited within the Federal sector for any extended period of time. However, the GIS community has recently garnered the attention and the support of the executive branch of government though the Presidential Management Agenda GeoSpatial One Stop E-Gov initiatives. Thousands of professionals in the U.S. have made the development of the NSDI their life's work. It is incumbent upon all of us to take advantage of this opportunity to redouble our efforts and to succeed in sustaining the goodwill within and between these initiatives. NOAA looks forward to working with USGS to build The National Map, Digital Coast, and ultimately, contribute to the development of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure."}]
