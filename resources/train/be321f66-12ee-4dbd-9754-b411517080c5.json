Specifically, IHAWP benefits were based on the state of Iowa employees' commercial health insurance plan and therefore does not contain the extensive benefits traditionally associated with Medicaid under the State Plan and, in particular, does not include the non-emergency medical transportation (NEMT) benefit.\nBriefly, the Code of Federal Regulations requires States to \"specify that the Medicaid agency will ensure necessary transportation for beneficiaries to and from providers.\" 2 Thus, all states are required to make NEMT available to their Medicaid beneficiaries. However, the provision of NEMT services and reimbursement methodologies are determined by the individual state Medicaid programs. In Iowa, an NEMT service broker called TMS Management Group 3 is used to manage NEMT services, including the authorization of transportation, verifying member and trip eligibility, processing transportation claims and reimbursements, and auditing trips and claims. 4 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) initially approved a waiver of the state of Iowa's responsibility to provide NEMT services for IHAWP members during the first year of the IHAWP (January 1, 2014 -December 31, 2014) with the possibility of extending the waiver based on an evaluation of the impact on member access to care. After CMS reviewed preliminary data on NEMT and access, Iowa's NEMT waiver for the IHAWP was extended through July 31, 2015 during which time a review of IHAWP member experiences (based on 2014 survey data) regarding transportation and access to care could be conducted. The findings from this data were mixed with somewhat more IHAWP-WP members (who do not have an NEMT benefit) than traditional Medicaid State Plan members (who do have an NEMT benefit) experiencing an unmet need for transportation to or from a health care visit. However, the difference was not statistically significant. Due to these results, CMS extended the NEMT waiver through March 31, 2016 (and subsequently through June 30, 2016 and requested the independent evaluators of the IHAWP conduct an additional survey of IHAWP and Medicaid State Plan (MSP) members regarding transportation and access to health care to provide additional information to consider before granting further extensions of the NEMT waiver. In response to this request, the Public Policy Center fielded a survey to over 30,000 IHAWP-WP, IHAWP-MPC, and MSP members (10,180 from each program) from October 28, 2015 -January 15, 2016 .

About 14 days after the postcard reminder, a second mailing was sent to those who had not responded to the initial mailing. In the mailed cover letter and on the reminder postcard, enrollees were given the option of completing the survey online and provided the website address for that purpose. In an effort to maximize response rates for the mailed survey, both a premium and an incentive were used in the first mailing: each initial survey packet included a $2 bill and respondents who completed and returned the survey within two weeks of the mailing were entered into a random drawing for one of ten $25 Wal-Mart gift cards."}, {"section_title": "Page 6", "text": "Return to TOC"}, {"section_title": "Response Rates", "text": "Response rates for each of the population groups is provided in Table 1 .

A little over one-quarter of MSP-FMAP members (26%) reported some type of dependence on others for driving to visits (i.e., driving self, using someone else's vehicle, someone else drives, using own vehicle, someone else drives, using their vehicle). Slightly more IHAWP-WP members (31%) and fewer IHAWP-MPC members (14%) reported depending on others for driving compared to MSP-FMAP.

First, those who chose to respond to the survey may be different from those who chose not to respond which can create biased results. In this evaluation, respondents were more likely to be older, white, and female as compared to non-respondents, regardless of plan type. Within the MSP-FMAP group, respondents were less likely to come from metropolitan areas when compared to non-respondents. Within the IHAWP-WP and IHAWP-MPC groups, respondents were more likely to be enrolled longer than non-respondents and more likely to be from metropolitan areas but less likely to be from non-metro or rural areas when compared to non-respondents. Second, survey respondents may have difficulty accurately remembering events which may introduce recall bias. This risk may not be high because of the relatively short time period for recalling events (6 months). Third, because administrative data are collected for billing and tracking purposes, they may not always accurately reflect the service provided. Finally, the logistic regression models are limited by the fact that there may be unobserved factors that differ between individuals which we are unable to adequately adjust for in the models. While this may bias our results, the direction and magnitude of any such bias cannot be well predicted."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "There were two main questions of interest in this research, namely, do IHAWP members who do not have an NEMT benefit experience more unmet NEMT need than those who do have the benefit (i.e., traditional Medicaid state plan members) and does plan type (IHAWP or MSP) and/or unmet NEMT need have an effect on getting particular health care services? With regard to the first question, without considering other factors, the findings suggest that individuals who do have the NEMT benefit (MSP-FMAP members) experience more unmet NEMT need than those who do not (IHAWP members) and the differences (MSP-FMAP 16%, IHAWP-WP 13%, and IHAWP-MSP 6%) are statistically significant at the p<.05 level. After considering other factors in a logistic regression model of unmet NEMT need, these results hold with IHAWP-WP having 21% lower odds and IHAWP-MPC having 50% lower odds of unmet NEMT need compared to MSP-FMAP members. Even though they experience less unmet NEMT need, more IHAWP-WP members (22%) report usually or always needing assistance from others getting to and from health care visits when compared to MSP-FMAP members (18%).\nWhen comparing health care utilization among the three groups, we considered three types of utilization, well care visits, acute care visits, and emergency department visits. Without considering other factors, around 15% of members, regardless of plan type, got a well care visit in the 6 months prior to the survey. When we considered multiple factors (including plan type and unmet NEMT need) in a multivariable logistic regression model predicting well care visits, there was a significant interaction effect between being in the IHAWP-WP and having an unmet NEMT need on well care visits. The likelihood of obtaining a well care visit for those in the IHAWP-WP depended on whether or not an individual experienced an unmet NEMT need. Individuals in the IHAWP-WP (compared to not being in the IHAWP-WP) had 39% greater odds (statistically significant) of having a well care visit when they did not have an unmet NEMT need and 16% lower odds (not statistically significant) when they did have unmet NEMT need. Conversely, when looking at the odds of a well care visit for those with unmet NEMT need (compared to those without an unmet NEMT need) within the IHAWP-WP strata, individuals with an unmet NEMT need had 40% lower odds (statistically significant) of a well care visit when in the IHAWP-WP and 2% lower odds (not statistically significant) when not in the IHAWP-WP. In other terms, for individuals not in IHAWP-WP, regardless of unmet NEMT status, about 14% experienced a well care visit. Yet, for individuals in the IHAWP-WP, 12% of those with an unmet need for NEMT had a well care visit compared to 18% of those without an unmet NEMT need (statistically significant difference).\nWith regard to acute care visits, without considering other factors, over 60% of MSP-FMAP and IHAWP-WP members had an acute care visit while just around 50% of IHAWP-MPC had at least one in the 6 months prior to the survey. When we considered plan type, unmet NEMT need, and other factors in a multivariable logistic regression model predicting acute care visits, there was no significant interaction effect between being in the IHAWP-WP and having an unmet NEMT need. Unmet NEMT need was not statistically associated with obtaining an acute care visit. However, those in the IHAWP-WP had 18% lower odds and IHAWP-MPC members had 39% lower odds of an acute"}, {"section_title": "Page 27", "text": "Return to TOC care visit compared to MSP-FMAP members, independent of unmet NEMT need and after adjusting for other model factors.\nWithout considering other factors, almost 30% of MSP-FMAP members had at least 1 visit to the ED which was significantly higher than either IHAWP-WP members (20%) or IHAWP-MPC members (16%). When we considered plan type, unmet NEMT need, and other factors in a multivariable logistic regression model predicting emergency department visits, there was no significant interaction effect between being in the IHAWP-WP and having an unmet NEMT need. Individuals with an unmet NEMT need had 45% greater odds of an emergency department visit, independent of plan type, and after adjusting for other model factors. And, those in the IHAWP-WP had 28% lower odds and IHAWP-MPC members had 37% lower odds of an emergency department visit compared to MSP-FMAP, independent of unmet NEMT need, and after adjusting for the other factors in the model.\nAt first glance, these results on health care utilization (particularly with regard to well care visits), coupled with the fact that IHAWP-WP members self-report worse health, may suggest that having an unmet need for NEMT and not having the NEMT benefit (i.e., being in the IHAWP-WP) leads to members in need of care not being able to obtain care. However, it is worth pointing out that those with the benefit (MSP-FMAP members) experienced more unmet NEMT need than those in the IHAWP-WP. Therefore, without considering the experiences surrounding why individuals have an unmet NEMT need in more detail, it could be premature to reach that conclusion.\nWhen we asked those with an unmet NEMT need for the main transportation-related reason for not being able to get to a health care visit, the most common reason in all three plan types was that the person who usually takes them to visits was not available (MSP-FMAP: 45%, IHAWP-WP: 53%, IHAWP-MPC: 44%]. Having a car that broke down (MSP-FMAP: 28%, IHAWP-WP: 15%, IHAWP-MPC: 26%) and other problems such as transportation-related expenses (i.e., cost of gas, bus fare, cab fare, parking, or paying a friend or relative for a ride), lack of informal support (i.e., not having a friend or relative available to drive), or health issues interfering with the ability to seek care (i.e., not feeling well enough to walk or drive) (MSP-FMAP: 21%, IHAWP-WP: 18%, IHAWP-MPC: 21%) were also cited as reasons. There was also some indication from the qualitative responses in the comments that there was a lack of awareness of and some dissatisfaction with the TMS NEMT brokerage program.
