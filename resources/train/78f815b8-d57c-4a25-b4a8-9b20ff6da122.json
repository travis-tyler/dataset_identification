The term was first used by farmers and originally referred to a visible plant disease or the thing that caused plant diseases; over time it has come to be associated with visible signs of decline of the social system, infrastructure, and population of a place (Mock 2017). Through this modified meaning, blight has often been used to describe undesirable aspects of urban space to achieve political objectives (Breger 1967; Weaver and Bagchi-Sen 2013). Economic-focused definitions of blight, which are consistent with Breger's (1967) definition, hone in on derelict physical conditions, including vacant, abandoned, foreclosed, and dilapidated buildings, vacant lots, and environmental contamination (Shilling and Pinzon 2016). Economic blight is thus conceptually similar to physical disorder (Skogan 2015). In the context of blight, disorder is viewed in terms of minor violations of community standards that indicate a decline in norms and values. These violations include aspects of physical disorder (trash, unkept vacant lots, condemned houses) and social disorder (loitering, panhandling, public drinking) (LaGrange, Ferraro, and Supancic 1992). Linking blight to violations of local norms is problematic, particularly because perceptions of blight are often tied to subjective visual cues and implicit bias. Sampson and Raudenbush (1999) found that observed (physical) disorder, which is conceptually similar to physical characteristics of blight, predicts perceived disorder, however as the portion of minority groups and poverty increases, all groups perceived higher levels of social disorder, despite independently observed neighborhood conditions. Perceptions of blight may be shaped by implicit bias and cultural"}, {"section_title": "Author Manuscript", "text": "stereotyping that is a product of historically and structurally induced racial inequality (Sampson and Radenbush 1999). Numerous studies have identified a relationship between physical and social disorder and fear of crime, however research findings linking disorder and crime are inconsistent (Markowitz et al. 2001;Skogen 2015;Taylor 2001). As a code enforcement tool, the concept of blight is often viewed in terms of compliance rather than as an outcome of a systemic social problem. Weaver (2013:171) contends that blight occurs when property owners fail to invest in or maintain property to code standards, thus blight is a result of individual inactions and coordination failures. Weaver describes the decline in real property as a result of aging and other natural forces. In the absence of proper maintenance, properties will advance over time to a state of blight, which imposes costs on neighboring properties. The 'recycling' of property, through repair and demolition, can counteract conditions of blight by bringing properties into compliance or eradicating them from the landscape. This focus on moving blighted properties into compliance as a means of stemming the onset or controlling blight is used in several studies (Johnson, Turcotte, and Sullivan 2010;Mallach 2012).\nThe public discourse associated with blight shifted from reform to renewal as blighted areas were framed as an economic liability. During the 1920s, the scholarship of Park, Burgess, and McKenzie (1925) of the Chicago School of sociology applied an ecological approach to urbanization and introduced the term \"blighted\" to refer to patterns of urban change that conceptualized ethnic and racial minorities as invading neighborhoods in search of affordable housing. To control the urban blight that was thought to threaten the economic survival of cities, local governments advocated for slum clearance, replacement of aging buildings, and infrastructure improvements (von Hoffman 2000). The Housing Act of 1937 provided federal funds for the construction of new public housing, with the requirement that an equal number of blighted properties be demolished (Gordon 2004). Following World War II, the Housing Act of 1949 introduced a new program for urban redevelopment that provided substantial funding to local governments for the acquisition of blighted land. By classifying an area as blighted, municipalities received federal funds that covered the majority of the costs to redevelop rundown or partially deteriorated neighborhoods (von Hoffman 2000). The term \"urban blight\" became a lucrative policy tool that allowed for land clearance and new development where land use was limiting downtown expansion (Shlay and Whitman 2006). Urban renewal programs, sanctioned through public policies, resulted in the widespread redistribution and segregation of minority populations and created longstanding barriers to integration and opportunity (Pritchett 2003). The passage of the Housing Act of 1949 exacerbated a two-tiered housing system by expanding programs for the construction of public housing and one-for-one replacement introduced in the Housing Act of 1937 while subsidizing the exodus of white homeowners to the suburbs. The redevelopment efforts for the decades that followed would focus on razing and rebuilding rather than improving the existing communities. As a result of urban renewal, widespread displacement of low-income families occurred and vibrant ethnic neighborhoods that were not the blighted, decaying slums as they had been labeled were demolished (Wright 1981). Though federal urban renewal was replaced by the Community Development Block Grant program in 1974, the language of blight persisted in the new program (Gordon 2004). In recent decades, identifying areas of blight has opened the doors for federal funding, local tax breaks, and use of eminent domain for private economic development and the displacement of local residents (Gordon 2004). Local governments have been given wide Author Manuscript discretion when defining blight, as a result blight is often a designation used to support improvement projects in areas that are underperforming economically (Gordon 2004). In 1982, Kelling and Wilson published an influential article in The Atlantic on the broken windows theory, which linked characteristics of blight within a community to social disorder. A and Bruinsma 2015). While research on the link between physical decline, social disorder and crime has produced varied results, broken windows theory has had a significant influence on the fields of community development and municipal government, particularly in the areas of code enforcement, local ordinances for property upkeep, and local policing (Schilling et al. 2015;Sampson and Raudenbush 1999;Skogen 2015).\n\nSmall towns are commonly thought of as places that are safe and free of urban social problems, yet more recent trends point to changes in rural America. Over the past several decades, alcohol and illicit drug use in rural areas has increased and is equal to or exceeds substance use in urban and suburban places (Dew et al. 2017). These changes are attributed to the erosion of rural economies, population changes, and increased poverty, which have led to increased vulnerability to substance abuse. Youth involvement in gangs exists in small towns but is low when compared to urban areas. The problem of rural blight is often viewed as different or less than urban blight problems due to geography, scale, or cultural differences. Oakerson and Clifton (2017:418) share an analogy of two houses, one immaculately maintained, the other dilapidated, with broken and boarded up windows and an overgrown, littered lawn and evidence of squatters and drug use on the porch. The authors posit that placed a mile apart, the owners of these two homes are not affected by one another. Proximity changes the dynamics. As we move the blighted property closer and closer until it is next door, the value of the homeowner's property plummets. Of more immediate concern, Mom and Dad do not want their children exposed to obvious substance abuse, and they are worried about the fire raging out of control. Rural communities also may be perceived as having different standards and a greater acceptance of blight compared to suburban communities (Schilling et al. 2015). This consideration of rural blight as a cultural norm rather than a more universal problem is consistent with the \"rural dystopia\" stereotype, in which rural residents, particularly in Appalachia, the Deep South, and Native American reservations, are perceived as shiftless and trashy (Aubrun and Grady 2003).\nRural blight is largely unacknowledged and has received little attention in public dialogue, land-use policy, and academic scholarship (Eisenberg 2016). The purpose of this research is to explore the extent to which economic and social blight are issues in rural communities in the Southeast, the relationship between different forms of blight, and the community characteristics associated multiple, serious housing and neighborhood condition problems. This research fills a gap in the literature on the problem of rural blight and begins to explore the policy options for addressing blight in small towns in the South.\n\u2022 Vacant houses \u2022 Low housing values \u2022 Businesses with a blighting influence (adult businesses, junkyards, heavy industrial) \u2022 Vacant industrial or commercial buildings We defined social blight using definitions put forth by Welsh, Braga and Bruinsma 2015, which is consistent with the definition of social disorder used by Sampson and Raudenbush (2004). The definition includes behaviors perceived to be threatening, such as vandalism, loitering, panhandling, prostitution and drugs that coexist with neighborhood decline and disorder. Social disorder behaviors were measured using the following survey items, with response items including none, some, quite a bit, and an extreme amount: \u2022 Property crimes/vandalism \u2022 Drug and/or gang activity \u2022 Panhandling and/or visible homeless population \u2022 Illegal dumping\noriginal four-point response scales into a dichotomous variable, where \"1\" contained responses of \"quite a bit\" and an \"extreme amount\" that suggest a more extensive level and responses of \"none \"or \"some\" that indicate the blight variable was a limited problem, were coded as \"0\". \"Extensive problem\" was used to represent a perceived higher presence of blight and \"limited problem\" represented otherwise. We chose to group \"none\" and \"some\" as one category and \"quite a bit \"and an \"extreme amount\" as another category for several reasons. We combined the \"quite a bit\" and an \"extreme amount\" responses because these statements use stronger language to describe the presence of the described blight variable. Grouping the responses in this way also allowed us to conduct a more meaningful analysis assessing the extensive presence of blight in the surveyed communities. In all categories of both physical and social blight, a majority of the responders indicated that there was at least \"some\" presence of each indicated blight category, with some categories with a proportion of over 90 percent (See Table 1). A number of neighborhood condition and community perception studies have used a similar method of collapsing multi-point Likert scales into dichotomous variables for the purpose of analyzing specific survey components, and producing results that were easily interpretable and understandable (Basolo and Strong 2010;Haney 2007;Hinkle and Yang 2013;Wallace et al. 2015).\nDilapidated housing units also had moderately strong positive correlations with low housing values. Vacant housing had moderately strong positive correlations with two forms of economic blightvacant industrial or commercial buildings and low housing values. There was a relatively weak positive correlation between vacant commercial units and dilapidated housing and between vacant commercial units and low housing values. Businesses with a blighting influence had weak but significant correlations with all forms of economic blight. While measures of social blight were identified less frequently overall, these forms of blight also tended to coexist within the communities in the study. Drug and/or gang activity and property crimes/vandalism had a strong significant positive correlation, with a correlation coefficient of .527. Illegal dumping had moderate positive correlations with property crimes, panhandling and visible homelessness, and drug/gang activity. [ Table 2 about here] The correlation analysis suggests a moderate relationship between economic blight and social blight variables for the communities represented in the study. There were several moderate, positive, significant relationships between economic and social blight. Dilapidated housing units were correlated with drugs/gang activity (.461) and property crimes (.400). Vacant housing units were correlated with illegal dumping (.400). Illegal dumping also had a moderately strong positive significant correlation with vacant housing units in need of rehabilitation or demolition, businesses with blighted influences, panhandling and/or visible homelessness population, and drug and/or gang activity. These findings suggest that physical and social disorder co-occur, or are perceived to co-occur, in some of the communities in the study. It does not indicate that one form of blight causes another. Table 3 provides descriptive data for the independent socioeconomic and community characteristics variables used in the regression analysis. The results of the negative binomial regression model using a log link containing the dependent variable \"blight total\" and seven independent socioeconomic and community characteristics variables are found in Table 4. [ Table 3 about here]\nThe results of the analysis indicate an association between percent black or African American and the presence of multiple forms of extensive blight represented by the \"Total Blight\" variable. Percent black or African American produced a statistically significant coefficient of 1.242, meaning, for each one percent increase in the black or African American population, the expected log count of the number of high-level blight categories increases by 1.242, all other variables held constant. Since the negative binomial model was estimated with a log link, for ease of an interpretation, we exponentiated the coefficients of the regression model. With an exponentiated value of 3.462, the number of high-level blight characteristics increases by 3.462 percent for every percent increase in the black or African American population. While the findings of our literature review suggested that population and density would be influential factors in the perception of economic blight, in particular, these variables were not significant in our model. Variables related to disruption of social networks, economic distress and decline (poverty and population change), also were not significant. Homeownership is linked to higher levels of residential stability and local financial investments, which are connected to greater citizen involvement in the community (McCabe 2013). However, the owner-occupancy variable was also not significant. Barnett and Mencken's (2009) finding that population stability compensates for varying community characteristics may explain the lack of significance for the poverty and owner-occupancy variables in the model.\nThis article is protected by copyright.

Progressive-era housing reformers, reacting in response to urbanization and industrialization, set the course for the modern definition of blight (Gordon 2004). Throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, blight primarily referred to substandard housing conditions that were detrimental to lower-income occupants' health and safety (Schilling and Pinzon 2016). Published in 1890, Jacob Riis's How the Other Half Lives drew attention to the crowded, unsafe, unsanitary, and oppressive conditions in housing occupied by immigrants living in New York tenements. Reformers advocated for improved housing conditions based on a philosophy, referred to as moral environmentalism, that clean, adequate housing would not only improve health and safety for the working poor but would also decrease crime and behaviors considered immoral, such as alcoholism, poor parenting, and unemployment (Bull and Gross 2018;von Hoffman 2000). This belief that poor physical conditions result in immoral behaviors would reappear in subsequent movements to address blight."}, {"section_title": "Blight through the Lens of Social Disorganization and Collective Efficacy Theories", "text": "Research examining the relationship between neighborhood decline and physical and social disorder has frequently drawn on social disorganization theory, and more recently, collective efficacy theory. Social organization theory, which is rooted in earlier Chicago school works, is based on the premise that communities vary in neighborhood cohesion, which is reflected in local friendship network ties and levels of resident civic and organizational participation (Markowitz et al. 2001;Park, Burgess and McKenzie 1925;Sampson and Groves 1989;Shaw and McKay 1942 While the majority of research using social disorganization and collective efficacy theories has focused on urban, high-poverty neighborhoods, these theoretical frameworks may be useful in examining blight in small towns. The community characteristics ascribed to social organization closely align with commonly held beliefs about small towns as places that are family-oriented, guided by morals and concern for the community and where everybody knows everybody (Hummon 1990). These ideological beliefs about small towns contrast with the social disorganization associated with urban places and suggest that small towns are less likely to experience social disorganization. While there is limited application of these theories in rural communities, Barnett and Mencken (2009) found that resource disadvantage (poverty, income inequality, unemployment, percent female-headed households) has a positive effect on violent and property crimes in nonmetropolitan counties experiencing population loss. However, the authors argue that population stability in nonmetropolitan communities serves as a resource due to higher levels of social integration and social control. This resource is thought to compensate for the lack of socioeconomic resources when examining the relationship between community characteristics and crime."}, {"section_title": "Blighted Properties, Social Disorder and Community Characteristics of Small Towns", "text": "Blight as a sign of physical and social disorder is not often associated with small towns in the United States. However previous research suggests that small towns in rural areas are contending with a range of housing and social problems, from dilapidated, vacant housing to drugs and gang problems (Housing Assistance Council 2012; Dew et al. 2007;Wells and Weisheit 2004). While small towns have housing and social problems similar to or worse than urban places, the problem of blight is largely considered an urban phenomenon."}, {"section_title": "Economic Blight", "text": "Small town housing suffers from higher levels of housing maintenance and condition problems, and higher levels of more severe structural problems compared to central cities and suburbs (Van Zandt et al. 2009). Rural places are vulnerable to high rates of substandard housing, with over five percent of non-metropolitan homes considered either moderately or severely substandard (Housing Assistance Council 2012). Despite high rates of homeownership and relatively large levels of equity, home values tend to be significantly lower than in urban areas (Housing Assistance Council 2012). Low home values, combined with lower household incomes, can make improvements and repairs unfeasible in rural communities (Ehrenberg, Moore, and Wang 2013). Lack of access to financing only compounds the challenges related to maintaining properties in rural communities. Code enforcement, which can serve as a mechanism for ensuring housing meets health and safety standards as well as more extrinsic community benefits such as curb appeal and housing resale, is a challenge in small towns due to limited resources and capacity (Rosser 2006). Lack of financing and local capacity may not be the only factors related to declining housing conditions. A study by Galster (1987), which found that neighborhood decline rather than low household income was related to lack of exterior home maintenance among urban homeowners, suggests that there is also a social dimension to property neglect and decline. Small towns and urban cities share similar challenges related to housingrelated blight. Eisenberg (2016) cites economic constraints, differing strategic views, unaccountable lenders, local politics, displacement, property title issues and the difficulty in locating property owners as issues related to blight that are shared by rural and urban communities."}, {"section_title": "Social Blight", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Design, Sampling, and Data Collection", "text": "This study is based on the analysis of data from a statewide survey of city staff and elected officials designed to explore the relationship between housing needs, neighborhood conditions, and social capital among rural communities.

For this study, we used Breger's (1967) definition and a typology of blight developed by Schilling et al. (2015) as a guide in defining economic blight. This typology includes the following characteristics pertaining to real propertyabandoned, unsafe, derelict buildings, substandard residential property, vacant residential property, vacant commercial property, and unwanted or highly regulated businesses with a blighting influence. Survey respondents were asked to rate the extent that the housing and neighborhood conditions are present in their city. Within this series of questions were two questions regarding housing conditions: 1) dilapidated housing in need of significant rehab or demolition and 2) older housing units in need of maintenance. These two questions were used to help respondents distinguish between housing that is aging and in need of repair and housing that has more substantial problems. For this analysis, we only examined the responses regarding dilapidated housing in need of significant rehab or demolition. Other than the questions about \"businesses with a blighting influence\", the term 'blight' was not used in this set of measures.

Based on the literature on social disorganization and collective efficacy theories, would expect that economic blight would be higher in communities experiencing higher rates of Author Manuscript poverty, population changes (which disrupt social networks), and higher rates of black and Latino residents and lower in communities with higher rates of homeownership (a proxy for residential stability). Additionally, perceptions of blight reported by survey respondents may be shaped by implicit bias and cultural stereotyping that is a product of historically and structurally induced racial inequality, thus we would expect to find differences in perceptions of blight in communities with higher proportions of residents who are not white (Sampson and Radenbush 1999). To examine the relationship between levels of blight and community characteristics, we developed a \"blight total\" variable by summing the number of forms of extensive blight for each community. We then used a negative binomial regression analysis, a variation of the Poisson model, to predict the socioeconomic and community characteristics related to multiple higher reported levels of blight among the communities in the study. Our dependent variable, \"blight total\", was calculated by combining all categories of blight which the respondent identified as a significant problem. This was accomplished using our recoded variables to measure more extensive forms of blight [see Table 1]. This \"blight total\" variable allowed us to conduct a negative binomial regression analysis of the dependent variable \"blight total\", which was a range of 0-9.

This finding is consistent with previous research on rural housing conditions (Housing Assistance Council, 2012). Similar to urban neighborhoods Author Manuscript experiencing disinvestment, a sizeable portion of the communities in the study appeared to be facing housing conditions associated with economic distress. For the residents in these communities, the impact of economic blight may be limited to the physical and mental health risks associated with living in poor quality housing. While economic and social blight forms tended to co-occur as is suggested by Kelling and Wilson's (1982) broken windows theory, forms of social blight were not a significant problem for most communities in the study. A small portion of respondents identified multiple forms of extensive blight within their communities, including 15 percent of the communities experiencing issues of drug and gang issues and property crimes. The lower occurrences of social blight may explain the lack of attention or interest in the issue of rural blight. It may be that urban blight, characterized in terms of both physical and social disorganization, is more pressing because it is includes multiple forms of health and safety risks that erode the quality of life and health and well-being outcomes for residents. More research is needed to understand the health and safety implications for small town residents living in areas with higher levels of physical and social blight, particularly when compared to residents in urban areas. While social disorganization and collective efficacy theories link a range of demographic characteristics to physical and social disorder, our findings pointed only to a significant relationship between communities with a higher portion of the population who are black and multiple forms of extensive blight. As noted in previous research by Sampson and Radenbush (1999), perceptions of blight in the community may be influenced by implicit bias against black residents. This may have been a factor for the respondents of the study, the vast majority of whom were white. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between perceived and observed blight in rural communities. Data collected from multiple stakeholders within the same community would enhance our understanding of rural blight issues and their impact on residents. Remediating problems due to dilapidated and vacant housing is a challenge facing both rural and urban communities experiencing economic and population decline. Nationwide, the number of vacant housing units in the U.S. increased by 44 percent, a problem that is concentrated in locations, often older industrial cities, which have lost population and employment opportunities (Mallach 2012). In this respect, rural communities and older, urban industrial cities share common challenges. Remediating these issues is particularly difficult for Author Manuscript small towns, where scale, demand, limited financial and human capital resources are barriers to maintaining, and improving local housing conditions. Rural blight is not inevitable, rather it is a problem that can be addressed by locally-driven solutions. While economic blight is the outcome when a property owner fails to invest in or maintain property to code standards, it is both these individual inactions and coordination failures among local governments that ultimately allows the ongoing decline of property conditions (Weaver 2013). A coordinated local response and technical assistance programs help small towns remediate some of the more pressing housing condition problems. Oakerson and Clifton (2017) describe the need to reframe the understanding of decline from an unrelenting process shaped by external forces to a framework in which neighborhood conditions are positively shaped by local collective action. By focusing on small spatial units, such as blocks and streets, neighbors and local organizations can make strategic investments, monitor conditions, and ensure enforcement of local property-based laws, while drawing on the social capital of larger organizations. Complementary changes in local government planning, code enforcement, and redevelopment authorities are needed to respond to concerns about and realign resources to address blight (Schilling et al. 2015). While this process has been applied in larger cities, more research is needed to understand how collective action and locally-driven strategies serve to remediate economic blight in small towns."}, {"section_title": "Blight Levels", "text": "Limited "}]
