[{"section_title": "", "text": "T he demand for food, timber, recreational opportunities, and housing in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic coast of the USA has had a lasting impact on the spatial patterns of the coastal landscape, which in turn has aff ected ecological processes and conditions (Forman and Godron, 1986;Forman, 1995;Turner, 1989). Point and nonpoint pollution resulting from these anthropogenic land uses has added sediments, nutrients, pesticides, and toxic metals to fresh, salt, and estuarine waterways (Basnyat et al., 1999;Novotny and Olem, 1994;USEPA, 1995). For instance, industrial and commercial land uses are known to be important sources of lead, copper, and zinc (Sonzogni et al., 1980). Our knowledge of these inputs and their impacts is largely due to environmental monitoring eff orts, which are necessary to identify degraded and threatened waterways, to measure changes in condition, and to assess the success of mitigation or restoration activities. For example, the EPA's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program-Estuaries component (EMAP-E) provides quantitative data on the status and changing condition of our nation's estuaries (USEPA, 1999). One challenge of large-scale monitoring eff orts, such as EMAP-E, is that it is impossible to monitor all estuaries all the time. Establishing the relationship between estuarine condition and landscape structure is important because it allows for the prediction of estuarine condition in estuaries that have not been monitored. Turner et al. (2001) discuss several studies that have modeled the relationships between landscape structure and eutrophication and pollution of freshwater systems; however, a review of the literature reveals that less work has been done in estuarine systems. Comeleo et al. (1996) and Paul et al. (2002) have explored these relationships in small estuarine systems of the Mid-Atlantic region. Using the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Pilot Project land cover data set and the U.S. Geologic Survey's Land Use Data Analysis data set, respectively, they found relationships between several measures of landscape composition (percent forest and percent urban) and sediment contamination. Additionally, across the northeastern USA, urban land uses near sampling stations have been linked to a variety of measures of estuarine condition (Dauer et al., 2000;Hale et al., 2004). Th e results from these prior studies show that it is possible to develop predictive models of the ecological condition of estuarine waters; however, associations between sediment condition and upstream land use are complex; therefore, a large number of predictive models is possible. In any study with many competing models, the methods used are often as interesting as the science underlying the models. Paul et al. (2002), as well as many of the previously cited studies of sediment contamination in estuaries, used standard parametric model selection techniques, which have generated useful results and demonstrate a powerful means for creating predictive models. For these methods to remain robust, several assumptions must be met (equality of variances, multivariate normality, and linearity), and the data must be replicated (Carpenter, 1990;Reckhow, 1990;Zar, 1999). Due to practical and logistical limitations, these assumptions are rarely satisfi ed with broad-scale environmental data, and thus the results of statistical tests may be questionable, and hypothesis-based model selection can be logically diffi cult (Anderson et al., 2000;Nester, 1996;Reckhow, 1990). Some alternatives to traditional parametric model selection include hierarchical Bayesian modeling and information theoretic approaches. Bayesian modeling methods have been successfully used in estuarine water quality monitoring (Borsuk et al., 2001;Borsuk et al., 2004) and promise to be powerful analytical tools. However, Bayesian methods are technically and mathematically demanding and therefore are not fully accessible by the scientifi c community (Burnham and Anderson, 2002). Information theoretic approaches are seeing wider use in ecology and environmental science partly because they provide a feasible alternative to Bayesian approaches and are easily implemented (Burnham and Anderson, 2002;Johnson and Omland, 2004;Richards, 2005). Th e objectives of our study are twofold: (i) to identify a simple set of readily available measures of watershed condition that can be used to predict estuarine sediment metal concentration and (ii) to use information theoretic multi-model inference methods described by Burnham and Anderson (2002) to advance the modeling described in Paul et al. (2002). Our general modeling approach follows the recommendations of the National Research Council of avoiding reliance on expensive, complex mechanistic models in favor of cheaper, simpler, statistical models (Reckhow et al., 2001)."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Area and Data", "text": "Our study area encompasses the United States' Atlantic Coast from southern New England to the southeastern USA ( Fig. 1). We used the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's EMAP-E and Mid-Atlantic Integrated Assessment (MAIA) data to characterize estuary condition and characteristics, the National Coastal Pollution Discharge Inventory (NCPDI) for information on point sources of metal inputs, the National Land Cover Dataset to estimate all land use/land cover area, and the United States Geological Survey river gauge data and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tide gauge data to estimate estuarine hydrology. In addition to these datasets, we used the National Elevation Dataset to delineate watersheds for estuarine sampling sites. Our fi nal dataset consisted of 112 EMAP sampling stations. Th ese stations were in estuaries with suffi cient coastal relief to automatically delineate watersheds and were not fl agged as questionable by the quality assurance, quality control codes in EMAP-E. Further detail on the data acquisition, compilation, fi ltering, and manipulation procedures used to synthesize the many datasets used in this study are briefl y discussed later in this section and in greater detail in Hollister (2004) and Hollister et al.

An important caveat is that one of the driving forces behind this project was to develop a methodology that could be easily and quickly repeated; therefore, we used only public domain data so that these methods could be extended to other regions of the country with few requirements for additional data collection."}, {"section_title": "Sediment Metal Concentrations", "text": "We built models to predict the concentration of cadmium, copper, mercury, and lead in estuarine sediments. We focused on these metals for various reasons. First, because this eff ort was in part a methods exploration, we wanted a dependent variable that would facilitate predictions. Total metals in estuarine sediments are known to be strongly related to land use (e.g., Comeleo et al., 1996;Paul et al., 2002), and the four individual metals we used have shown the strongest individual relationships with developed land in coastal watersheds (Hollister et al., 2007). Beyond mere statistical considerations, metals in general are known to come from mostly anthropogenic sources, represent long-term impacts, and are associated with degraded biological condition (Cochran et al., 1998;Kim et al., 2000;Sonzogni et al., 1980). We recognize that using sediment metal concentrations does not result in a true or \"best\" measure of estuarine condition because it ignores other mechanisms for degradation (e.g., hypoxia, other toxics, degraded habitat). However, the models developed with these four metals as dependent variables has utility because they predict values that are closely associated with anthropogenic impacts, have links to existing broad-scale data sets, and build on fi ndings of previous studies (Comeleo et al., 1996;Hollister et al., 2007;Paul et al., 2002)."}, {"section_title": "Modeling Approach and Model Development", "text": "We used an information theoretic approach for our model development and assessment. Th ese approaches are free from the assumptions required for hypothesis-based model selection and thus are a better choice with environmental data that rarely meet the classic assumptions. However, information theoretic approaches are designed for model selection and multi-model averaging and do not introduce new methodologies for parameter estimation (i.e., parameters may be estimated with maximum likelihood or ordinary least squares); therefore, the assumptions of the models and parameter estimation (i.e., for linear models-linearity, normality and equality of variance in residuals, etc.) must hold true. Information theoretic approaches, unlike standard regression model selection methods, do not rely on p values to measure the quality of a model. Instead, they attempt to directly estimate eff ects and eff ects sizes of a \"set of candidate models\" developed a priori through the use of Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) (Burnham and Anderson, 2002). Th e values of the Akaike Information Criteria are unitless and can be converted to AIC diff erences, which is the diff erence between the AIC of a given model and the minimum AIC of the candidate set (Eq. [1]). Th e \u0394 i is converted to the Akaike weight w i (Eq. [2]) and is directly interpreted as the probability that the model is the best model out of the candidate set. For details of these equations, see Burnham and Anderson (2002). Development of our set of candidate models was based on the published literature and current scientifi c understanding of the eff ects of human impact on estuarine sediment metal concentrations. We followed common practice and developed a general global model of the system and created alternative models as nested subsets of the global model (Burnham and Anderson, 2002). Th e parameters were estimated using ordinary least squares, specifi cally with the \"glm\" function in R version 1.9.1 (R Development Core Team, 2004). For any of the candidate models to provide a reasonable linear fi t, the global model must be assessed for linearity and the residuals examined for homoscedasticity and normality. Adjusted R 2 values were examined for each of the four global models (Cu, Pb, Hg, and Cd). Residuals were examined for homoscedasticity with Levene's test on the median of the residuals and a Shapiro-Wilk's test was used to assess normality (Brown and Forsythe, 1974;Zar, 1999). Standard transformations of the dependent and independent variables were explored to resolve problems with the residuals and fi t, and the transformations used were determined by residual analysis and ease of interpretation of the fi nal model. Following these procedures, we log transformed Cu and Pb. We used a log transformation of the form ln(Metal + k) and followed suggestions in Zar (1999) to use k = 1. When we followed these suggestions, the log transformations for Hg and Cd still resulted in a highly non-normal univariate distribution. Power transformations for Hg (Hg 0.2 ) and Cd (Cd 0.3 ) more closely approximated a normal distribution. Smaller values of k (e.g., 0.1, 0.5, etc.) in the log transformation begin to approximate a normal distribution, but the univariate distributions are still slightly non-normal; however, for Cd, a transformation of ln(Cd + 0.1) resulted in normally distributed residuals of the global model. Th e resulting predictions from a log-transformed global model, using ln(Cd + 0.1), are very similar to predictions from the global model with a power transformation of Cd 0.3 . In this case we defer to the suggestion in Zar (1999) and only considered using log transformations of the form ln(metal + 1) and thus favor the power transformations over log transformations with diff erent values of k for Cd and Hg. Several other factors were taken into consideration when devel-oping the set of candidate models. First, the number of parameters in any given model should not be more that one tenth of the sample size (in our case no more than 11 parameters). Second, a combination of observational studies and critical a priori examination of potential variables should be used when selecting parameters (Burnham and Anderson, 2002). Based on these guidelines, we examined 19 potential independent variables (Table 1). Th e process of a priori model development resulted in the inclusion of seven of these independent variables in the fi nal modeling, and data were collected for only these seven variables (Table 1). Th e other 12 potential variables were excluded from further consideration for various reasons. Prior studies determined that cadmium was most strongly related to urban lands within the drainage basin and within 2.5 km of sampling stations, whereas copper and mercury showed the strongest relationship at 10 km and lead at 7.5 km (Hollister et al., 2007). Developed and agricultural area estimates and total annual point source loadings for each metal were calculated with these empirically derived distance-limited watersheds (2.5 km for cadmium, 7.5 km for lead, and 10 km for copper and mercury). Although the NCPDI, EMAP-E, and the MAIA data cover diff erent temporal extents (the NCPDI is from 1991 and prior, and EMAP-E and MAIA range in date from 1990 to 1997), it was assumed that the point-loading estimate from 1991 would adequately represent total point sources for all years. Th e total estuarine area and sediment grain size (i.e., silt/clay percentage) were taken directly from the EMAP-E dataset. Estuarine hydrology was included in the models as freshwater infl ow and tidal range. Freshwater infl ow and tidal range were estimated from the closest USGS-monitored river or NOAA tide gauge. River gauges were limited to those that fell within the sampling station's drainage area. Data for each of these variables (Table 1) were compiled from 112 EMAP-E and MAIA sampling stations (for details see Hollister, 2004). We examined the fi nal 45 models (Table 2) for major violations of multiple linear regression assumptions. An important caveat to our eff ort is that the primary goal of this analysis is the development of predictive models of estuarine sediment metal concentrations and not necessarily the identifi cation of the mechanisms driving estuarine sediment contamination. Any conclusions regarding the underlying processes and mechanisms should be considered the result of a largely exploratory and not confi rmatory analysis."}, {"section_title": "Multimodel Inference", "text": "From the set of 45 parameterized candidate models, we created functions in R version 1.9.1 and calculated the AIC (output from \"glm\" function), AIC c (an adjustment to AIC for small samples), AIC \u0394 i , and AIC w i (R Development Core Team, 2004). In a model selection framework, it is possible to interpret w i as the probability that a given model is best; therefore, the objective is to identify and select the model with the highest w i . However, were a single \"best\" model to be used to make inferences, those inferences would be conditional on that single model and would require the explicit consideration of model selection uncertainty. If it is not clear which of the models from the set of candidate models is \"best\" as measured by w i (i.e., w i >0.9 for any given model), then Excluded-Shown to be inaccurate (USGS 2003 Forest Area (ha) of forest in an estuarine drainage within a given distance Excluded-Negatively correlated with human land uses.

Instead of relying on a single \"best\" model, we used an information theoretic-based model averaging approach (Burnham and Anderson, 2002). Each of the candidate models were weighted by its Akaike weight and combined into a single, averaged model. Th is was accomplished by generating weighted parameter estimates (i.e., parameter estimate multiplied by w i then summed across all models) for each parameter and making an \"averaged\" prediction from the combined model (Burnham and Anderson, 2002). Model averaging is appropriate when the primary goal is prediction (Burnham and Anderson, 2002). We did not include the 31 models that had an Akaike w i of essentially zero (i.e., <0.0001) in the calculation of the model averaged parameter estimates. We assessed prediction accuracy from the averaged model by the mean absolute error (MAE) and by the percent of the total range of observed values (MAE/[max. metal conc. \u2212 min. metal conc.]); however, the ecological and biological relevance of these concentrations is not readily apparent from the raw numbers, and further investigation is often required. One method to describe metal concentrations in terms that are ecologically relevant is to use the eff ects range (ER) (Long et al., 1995). Th e ER is one way (of many) that relates biological condition to sediment metal concentration. Th e eff ects range low (ERL) and the eff ects range median (ERM) may be used to rank the concentration into a low (below ERL), medium (between ERL and ERM), or high (i.e., above ERM) potential for producing a biological impact. We converted the predicted values to an ER ranking for two reasons. First, we wanted to provide a rough test of the ability of these models to accurately predict estuarine condition. We converted each of the predicted values to a low, medium, or high level of impact based on the ER ranking and calculated the accuracy of these predictions with the use of a 3 \u00d7 3 error matrix similar to those used to assess the accuracy of thematic spatial data (Congalton and Green, 1999). Second, predicting a transformed (i.e., log or power transformed) concentration requires a back transformation to the original units, which may introduce a bias. However, it is our opinion that this bias is relatively small and would not aff ect our fi nal conclusions. Th e impact of bias is further diluted when using a range of concentrations, like the ER rankings. We have not corrected for this bias in our back transformations. Th ese approaches are an improvement on past modeling (e.g., Comeleo et al., 1996;Paul et al., 2002) because they allow predictions based on multiple models, not just on a single, selected \"best\" model. Th e resulting predictions more robustly infer ecological condition of estuarine sediments by accounting for model selection uncertainty. Th is is an improvement because no longer is a single model, whose selection will likely vary as a result of the specifi c data used for parameterization, used to make predictions. In theory the model-averaged prediction accounts for this uncertainty (Burnham and Anderson, 2002). Although comparing information theoretic methods with more traditional methods (e.g., stepwise selection) might prove useful, other investigators have done similar comparisons, and repeating those here is beyond the scope of this study (Burnham and Anderson, 2002). We rely on their fi ndings that multi-model inference is an improvement on standard stepwise model selection."}, {"section_title": "Results and Discussion", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Descriptive Statistics and Eff ects Range Values of Actual Sediment Metal Concentrations", "text": "Many of the variables were positively skewed; in particular, the four dependent variables (Cu, Cd, Hg, Pb) showed fairly dramatic positive skewness, indicating that high concentrations were rare (Table 3). Similarly, the distribution of the ER values indicates that for this sample of estuaries, highly aff ected sediments are rare. For copper, 74% of the samples had a low potential for biological impact, and 26% had a medium risk of biological impact. None of the samples had a high potential for biological impact for copper. Lead showed a similar pattern, with 74% low, 24% medium, and 2% with a high potential. Mercury had 69% low, 24% medium, and "}, {"section_title": "Model Results", "text": "To determine if transformations were needed and if the set of independent variables was reasonable, the general fi t of the global model was assessed, and the residuals were examined for homogeneity of variance and normality. Although statistically significant, the nontransformed global models had adjusted R 2 values that were relatively low (0.23-0.55), had skewed residuals, and had residual plots indicating heteroscedasticity. In all cases, transforming the dependent variables increased the adjusted R 2 and removed heteroscedasticity; however, the residuals were still signifi cantly non-normal (Table 4). Although transformations (log and square root) of many of the independent variables improved normality and made marginal improvements in the adjusted R 2 , they would have added considerable complexity in the interpretation of the fi nal models. Regression is fairly robust to deviations from normality in the residuals as long as the residuals are also homoscedastic (Gonz\u00e1lez and Auda, 2002). Th erefore, we only transformed the dependent variables. Th e adjusted R 2 of the 45 models ranged from 0 to 0.79. Th e w i for each model ranged from essentially 0 (i.e., <0.0001) to 0.409 (Table 2). Only the 14 models with w i >0.0001 are reported. Th ese were the same models across all metals and were those that contained parameters for total hectares of urban land and the percent of silt/clay in the sediment (Table 5). Th e ranking varied for each metal, and the adjusted R 2 for models without these variables was substantially lower. Th is result corroborates several prior studies and suggests that the total amount of urban land is a useful predictor of sediment metal concentrations and that the physical conditions of sediments are important in determining contaminant concentration (Kennish, 1986;Novotny and Olem, 1994;Paul et al., 2002). Beyond urban land and percent silt/clay, there was variation in the importance of the remaining variables, and it was not readily apparent which were the most important, except area of the estuary for cadmium. Area of the estuary was added to the models as a surrogate for atmospheric deposition, which is a known source of the metals we modeled (e.g., Kim et al., 2000;Sabin et al., 2005). However, much of the true variation is unlikely to be captured by a simple measure such as estuarine area because it does not account for variations in deposition caused by precipitation or distance from source (Cochran et al., 1998;Friedland et al., 1986;Kim et al., 2000), nor does it account for changes in the metals as they enter into and are transported in the estuarine environments (Sadiq, 1992). Th ese factors, along with other variables not included in our models (e.g., wetlands), contribute to the uncertainty in the importance of the other variables and the relatively low percent of variation explained for cadmium and mercury."}, {"section_title": "Model Averaging and Prediction Accuracy", "text": "Th e model-averaged adjusted R 2 values for the copper, lead, mercury, and cadmium models are 0.784, 0.705, 0.564, and 0.503, respectively; the model-averaged SEs of the residuals are 0.604, 0.540, 0.161, and 0.242, respectively (Table 6). Tests of the assumptions (i.e., homoscedasticity and normality of residuals) for 11.00 0.0017 \u2020 K represents the total number of parameters (i.e., the intercept, independent variables, and residual variance). the model-averaged residuals are nearly identical to those of the global models and thus are not presented. Because the averaged models account for model selection uncertainty, the adjusted R 2 for the averaged models is lower than that for the individual \"best\" model. Th is is a benefi t because inferences based on the averaged model are more stable than those based on a single \"best\" model, even if that \"best\" model has a higher adjusted R 2 (Burnham and Anderson, 2002). In cases where w i is not high (i.e., >0.9), model selection uncertainty likely plays a role, and model averaging should be used (Burnham and Anderson, 2002). Th is was this case with our models because the highest w i was only 0.3, indicating that given another dataset, a diff erent \"best\" model could be selected; thus, model selection uncertainty is quite high, and model averaging is necessary in our case. Th is fact suggests an improvement over past studies (e.g., Comeleo et al., 1996;Paul et al., 2002), where only a single best model was identifi ed by traditional means. Overall the averaged models do a fairly good job at predicting the actual metal concentrations and the ER values (Table 7 and Fig. 2). However, on average, estimates of copper are 1.61 \u03bcg g \u22121 greater than the actual concentration. Lead is underestimated by 2.23 \u03bcg g \u22121 , mercury is underestimated by 0.042 \u03bcg g \u22121 , and cadmium is underestimated by 0.14 \u03bcg g \u22121 . As a percentage of the total range of observed values, copper is overestimated by only 0.61%. Lead is underestimated by 0.68%, mercury by 1.28%, and cadmium by 2.13%. Th ese patterns of over-and underestimation are also borne out by comparing predicted versus observed plots (Fig. 2). For instance, cadmium has more points above the perfect agreement line, indicating more transformed predictions lower than the expected transformed values. Prediction accuracies of the ER rankings were 78.6% for mercury, approximately 84% for copper and lead, and 92.0% for cadmium (Table 7). In general, the models correctly predicted low rankings, with most misclassifi cation occurring in the predictions of medium and high conditions, and one of the low predictions was misclassifi ed as high, lending further credibility to the model predictions. Additionally, omission errors (i.e., Type II errors) were generally lower than commission errors (i.e., Type I errors) for the low ranking. Th is was reversed for the medium ranking because the models more often classifi ed actual medium rankings as low or high. It is important to use some caution when evaluating class-specifi c measures of accuracy in an error matrix because they only show the probability of correct classifi cation. Often it is more interesting to evaluate what types of misclassifi cations are occurring. Th is information is contained in the commission (Type I) and omission (Type II) errors (Table 7).

Commission errors are the inverse of this and indicate that the model incorrectly classifi es an estuary that is actually medium or high as low. Using these models in a screening framework (see Screening Models) highlights the importance of commission error because high commission error results in potentially degraded estuaries being missed and not examined when in fact they should be. Because a certain degree of error is unavoidable, it is necessary to determine what level of commission error is unacceptable when using predictive models such as these. Making this determination is not straightforward and must be done on a case-by-case basis."}, {"section_title": "Screening Models", "text": "Ours and similar models may be used in a screening process. Model predictions provide a mechanism to limit estuaries included in a monitoring sampling scheme to make better use of environmental monitoring resources and to focus data collection in estuaries that are most likely imperiled. For example, our models use independent variables that have little value in a management context (i.e., it is largely impossible to reduce overall urban land or alter silt/clay content of the sediment), and modeling metals with these variables predicts ambient sediment metal concentrations. Estuaries with sediment metal concentrations greater than predicted could be considered elevated. Th ese are identifi ed by plotting predicted values on the x axis and observed values on the y axis with a line representing perfect agreement (Fig. 2). Points that fall above the line indicate estuaries with sediment metal concentrations higher than expected by the model.

Th ese include, among others, computer intensive methods (e.g., Monte Carlo simulation), information theoretic approaches, and Hierarchical Bayesian methods (Burnham and Anderson, 2002;Reckhow, 1990). Most of these approaches are somewhat recent to ecology and environmental science, and it is not necessarily clear under which conditions one method is superior. Some (e.g., many of the Bayesian methods) can be diffi cult to implement without a great deal of statistical expertise and custom programming. Th e information theoretic approaches are based on similar principles as the Bayesian approaches but are much easier to implement. Th ey provide an estimate of a model's suitability relative to competing models, no arbitrary probability of acceptance or rejection is required (e.g., a p value <0.05), and the importance of a given model or set of models is left up to the interpretation of the analyst. Environmental scientists and ecologists must decide to use the traditional methods that have known shortcomings for many environmental applications or to implement more contemporary methods (i.e., information theoretic approaches) that hold promise as an improvement on traditional null hypothesis-based model selection methods. Th is is especially the case when scientists are developing and evaluating multiple plausible hypotheses (Johnson and Omland, 2004;Richards, 2005). Studies such as ours and others (e.g., Johnson and Omland, 2004;Richards, 2005) suggest that until superior methods are developed or current debates are resolved (e.g., Burnham and Anderson, 2004;Link and Barker, 2006), it seems wise to choose the best available model selection and prediction methodology that can also be readily implemented.
