[{"section_title": "", "text": "regarding academic prestige and stratification. Specific to the field of communication, Barnett et al.' s 2010 study represents the first effort to systematically investigate the dynamics of academic exchange among communication doctoral programs in the United States.\nIn this prior work, communication emerges as a very multidisciplinary field: A considerable proportion of faculty members in communication PhD programs were found to have received their doctoral degrees from other disciplines, among which sociology, English and literature, and library and information science ranked top 3. However, the increasing popularity of digital media (recently documented in the NCA 2013 Academic Job Listings Report 1 ) and the growing influence of related disciplines such as computer science and informatics are likely to have prompted changes in recruitment strategies and faculty composition-changes that have less to do with the quality of the doctoral programs than with the shifting priorities of the job market.\nAcademic prestige, measured by indicators of scholarly productivity (e.g., number of publications from faculty members), has often been used as a proxy for the quality of doctoral programs. However, some research has challenged the appropriateness of this proxy and has proposed alternative metrics drawn from recruitment networks. In the field of sociology, for instance, research has shown that centrality in the recruitment network explains most of the variation in prestige, controlling for scholarly productivity and faculty size; the analyses also suggest that productivity is not a strong predictor of prestige (Burris, 2004) . In political science, Masuoka et al. (2007a) found that the number of PhD placements (from 1960 to 2005) had a .68 correlation with the U.S. News and World Report's rankings. Schmidt and Chingos report an even higher correlation (.93) in their 2007 study (Schmidt & Chingos, 2007) . In communication, the 2010 study also reported a significant correlation between various centrality measures and the position of the programs in reputational rankings (Barnett et al., 2010) ; these correlations, however, are based on a subset of all programs (those for which rankings were available, N = 28). A subsequent study replicated these analyses with the ranking data from National Research Council (NRC), which include a greater number of programs (N = 80); associations among centrality measures and NRC rankings were found to be moderate (Barnett & Feeley, 2011) . None of these studies controlled for confounding factors such as faculty size, which might explain part of the association.\nDiscussions about prestige aside, the common assumption in most research on recruitment is that the act of hiring represents a display of deference from the recruiting institution: It signals an acknowledgment of the institution that trained the PhD (Hanneman, 2001) . Under this assumption, academic exchange implies status hierarchy, reflecting a stratification of the academic field (Clauset et al., 2015) . The relevant question, then, is whether we can identify the factors that explain the emergence of that structure: What explains the creation of hiring and placing ties among academic institutions? What are the underlying mechanisms that shape the recruitment network? Reputational rankings might be part of the explanation but there may be an alternative story: the inertias that derive from interpersonal communication among faculty and their career paths.\nResearch on job mobility suggests that employers make hiring decisions based on information drawn from their personal networks of colleagues, friends, and acquaintances; likewise, employees can also access information about job openings through their personal connections (Granovetter, 1995; Ioannides & Loury, 2004; Pennings & Wezel, 2007) . In this regard, hiring ties connect organizations by creating communication channels through which \"insider\" information can diffuse (Baker, 1990; Uzzi, 1996) . Networks offer an important form of social capital because they channel direct communication-in this case, about potential hires-that is not easily available otherwise (Collet & Hedstr\u00f6m, 2013; Gulati & Gargiulo, 1999; Podolny, 2001 ). In the context of academic recruitment, when institution A places a recent PhD in institution B, an informational channel is created or reinforced between the two: The PhD can now provide information about graduates from institution B to a recruiting committee in institution A; in other words, the original hire will increase the likelihood of forming future hiring ties between the two institutions. This reciprocity effect is one of the many possible micro processes through which the formation of a tie may catalyze new recruitment dynamics (Rivera, Soderstrom, & Uzzi, 2010) . The important insight is that these dynamics have less to do with the quality of education than with the path dependence of prior recruitments.\nAnother manifestation of this type of network effect takes the form of clustering. Research suggests that information exchange is still possible if two unconnected nodes have ties with a common third partner: This can act as a mediator for information exchange among the other two, and can potentially trigger the creation of the missing tie that will close the triangle. This transitivity mechanism points at dynamics of clustering and closure similar to situations when \"people tend to become friends with the friends of their friends\" (Rivera et al., 2010) . Transitivity effect appears in social networks across a range of different contexts, including corporate board members (Davis, Yoo, & Baker, 2003) , movie actors (Watts, 1999) , and scientists (Newman, 2001) ; similar patterns have also been observed in the context of organizations (Kogut & Walker, 2001) . Sharing a common third partner, the explanation goes, facilitates the formation of a tie between previously disconnected parties because it decreases uncertainty: It minimizes the risk associated with a new connection by providing information about the potential partner through gossip or referrals (Burt & Knez, 1995) . What this research suggests, in other words, is that networking among academics transforms the networks forged at the level of their institutions.\nThis intuition should come naturally to those working in academia: Networking activities such as conferences, workshops, and seminars exist to facilitate the creation of bridges across institutions; and those bridges are reinforced through recruitment, which settles career mobility paths that connect universities and open channels for information exchange. A less intuitive network effect that also derives from these dependence dynamics takes the form of cumulative advantage. This effect is commonly referred to as the rich-get-richer phenomenon (Merton, 1968) and as preferential attachment, a mechanism of tie formation proposed in some models of network growth (Barab\u00e1si & Albert, 1999; Price, 1976 ). This effect is responsible for the stratification of networks, that is, for the emergence of nodes that are much better connected than the others not because of an intrinsic attribute but because they gained a small initial advantage that gets amplified over time. This effect materializes in the form of hubs or highly connected nodes in the network.\nThe relative effect of these network dynamics on academic hiring vis-\u00e0-vis the institution-specific covariates (e.g., faculty size, reputational rankings) has never been tested in prior studies, certainly not in the field of communication. Being able to determine to what extent hiring ties respond to dynamics of reciprocity, transitivity, and cumulative advantage is significant for two reasons: First, it uncovers the interorganizational logic that shapes the field; and second-and most importantly-it yields a more accurate and realistic representation of what drives academic hiring, helping us reevaluate prior conclusions that faculty-hiring patterns are a good proxy for the quality of doctoral education. According to theories of labor market dynamics, there are two reasons why employee mobility matters: It creates ties between organizations that diffuse reliable and up-to-date information about potential recruits, and it allows new faculty to bring new routines and priorities into organizations, such as specific research areas in recruitment calls (Collet & Hedstr\u00f6m, 2013; Gulati & Gargiulo, 1999; Pennings & Wezel, 2007) . Here we measure the imprint of those dynamics on the recruitment network.\nIn order to test the relative importance of network effects versus institutional attributes, the analyses that follow consider recruitment ties as the dependent variable. The explanatory variables separate the effects of the network structure itself (i.e., in the form of reciprocity, transitivity, and cumulative advantage) from the effects of institutional attributes that are exogenous to the network (i.e., characteristics of the nodes, which in our case represent universities). The following section provides a detailed description of these variables and explains why they have the potential to shape the formation of recruitment ties. We use these explanatory factors to disentangle the relative importance of network effects in recruitment patterns and test our main claim that path dependence driven by faculty mobility is more important than measures of prestige in understanding hiring dynamics."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "We collected data following a procedure similar to Barnett et al. (2010) . Our starting point was the NCA Doctoral Program Guide, 2 which at the time of data collection (summer 2014) included 77 U.S. institutions that offer PhDs in communication. We then collected information about the faculty listed on the websites of these institutions. For each faculty member (tenured or in a tenure-track position) we recorded information on the following attributes: name, current institution, rank (full, associate, or assistant professor), institution where PhD was obtained, year when PhD was obtained, and field of PhD. In addition to the NCA guide, Barnett et al. conducted an email survey to elicit information from faculty members; their survey had a 71% response rate. Our data collection relied only on web-based information, primarily the faculty profiles on institutional or personal websites and the ProQuest dissertation database. More information is available online today than in 2007 as institutions and faculty have since significantly improved their web presence. In total, we collected data on 1,955 faculty members who obtained their PhD degrees from a total of 173 institutions, of which only 77 are included in the NCA list.\nWhen reconstructing the recruitment network, we decided to focus on PhDgranting institutions as the unit of analysis, as opposed to programs (the approach followed by Barnett et al.) . We made this choice for two reasons: First, a considerable proportion of faculty profiles merely indicate the names of the universities and disciplines (e.g., communication) where they obtained their doctoral degrees, not the specific PhD-granting programs (e.g., school of journalism or mass communication). In addition, program names evolved historically and some no longer exist. Barnett et al. acknowledged this issue in their study and they simply replaced the outdated program names with the most current versions. We believe that performing our analysis at the level of institutions allows us to avoid this source of ambiguity and to engage with the empirical findings from prior research conducted in other disciplines, which typically focus on institutions as the unit of analysis (Clauset et al., 2015; Fowler et al., 2007) .\nOur network thus consists of institutions granting PhDs in communication (the nodes in the network) and the recruitment ties that connect these institutions: If institution A sends a tie to institution B, it means that B has at least one faculty member with a PhD from A. Ties are weighted, that is, they have values equal to the number of faculty sent from one university to another. As a first approximation to the data, Figure 1 offers summary statistics of the recruitment network based on the network effects discussed above. These statistics are standard network metrics (Newman, 2010; Wasserman & Faust, 1994) , which we illustrate with the example networks in the lower panels of Figure 1 .\nReciprocity measures the proportion of mutual connections in a graph, which in the context of our data refers to how many institutions reciprocate hiring ties. Transitivity is a measure of network clustering; in this case, we used the ratio of the triangles over the connected triples in the network as a first approximation to the observed clustering. It is important to note for subsequent analyses that this network configuration is usually nested in higher order structures, as illustrated by the example network in Figure 1 . Finally, degree correlation is a measure of similarity in terms of network centrality-it measures whether central nodes tend to interact with other central nodes (in which case, the correlation is positive) or whether they interact, instead, with peripheral nodes (in which case, the correlation is negative). The red dots in Figure 1 correspond to the observed values and the boxplots help assess their significance: They offer a benchmark (or null model) based on the reconstruction of 1,000 random networks with the same size, density, and degree distribution as the observed Figure 1 Differences between observed and random networks. Note: Boxplots are based on 1,000 random networks with the same size, density, and degree distribution as the observed recruitment network. The comparison with observed values (red dots) suggests some underlying mechanisms of network formation: reciprocity, transitivity, and the tendency of central nodes to link to peripheral nodes. recruitment network. This random benchmark is known as the configuration model in the networks literature (Newman, 2003) .\nThe comparison between observed and expected values already suggests some underlying mechanisms of network formation. First, about a quarter of all recruitment ties are reciprocated, which is significantly higher than expected by chance. This indicates that a recruitment tie is more likely if it creates a mutual connection between institutions. Second, we also observe a higher level of local transitivity than one would expect at random. This suggests that a recruitment tie is more likely to form between two institutions if they are connected to a common third institution. Finally, the negative degree correlation indicates that central institutions have a tendency to form recruitment ties with peripheral ones (i.e., those with less recruitment activity and therefore less prominent in the network). Although this statistic is not significantly different from what one could expect in a random network, it still suggests a core-periphery structure, which is often the result of cumulative advantage dynamics."}, {"section_title": "Distribution of centrality scores", "text": "Barnett et al. used four network measures of centrality: out-degree, in-degree, the NEGOPY rank (a measure that they claim is similar to closeness centrality), and eigenvector centrality. These measures of centrality have long been used to analyze the distribution of prestige in social systems (Bonacich, 1987) . Out-degree and in-degree are simple counts of ties sent and received, respectively. Eigenvector centrality (when applied to undirected networks) refines degree centrality by taking into account the entire network structure to identify prominent nodes. According to this measure, the centrality of each institution is proportional to the sum of the centralities of the institutions to which it is connected (Bonacich & Lu, 2012) . In directed networks, the underlying adjacency matrix is asymmetric, which means that it has two leading eigenvectors and two different distributions of weighted centrality, one for outgoing ties and one for incoming ties. We employ, for this reason, the authority and hub scores defined in Kleinberg (1999) . They are similar to the eigenvector measure used in Barnett et al.'s study, but adapted to the fact that we are analyzing a directed network. We follow Fowler et al. (2007) in assuming that hub scores are a proxy for placement capacity, that is, the ability to place PhDs in the most prominent institutions; and that authority scores are a proxy for hiring capacity, that is, the ability to hire PhDs graduating from the most prominent institutions. We do not use the NEGOPY measure of closeness centrality because we believe it is redundant once hub and authority scores are taken into account. Figure 2 plots the centrality distributions for these four measures. The distributions are skewed, especially for placing capacity (as measured by number of faculty placed and the hub score). What this means is that the level of stratification is more visible when it comes to placing PhDs: Institutions are more heterogeneous in their Figure 2 Distribution of centrality measures (placement and hiring capacity). Note: Faculty hired is equal to the sum of weighted in-degree, and faculty placed is equal to the sum of weighted out-degree. Authority and hub scores have a similar interpretation to eigenvector centrality but they apply to directed networks. These measures suggest that the distribution of centrality is skewed, especially for placing capacity: Institutions are more heterogenous in their ability to place their PhDs. The maps reveal geographical areas of high network density. ability to place their graduates, with clear outliers (or hubs) in that distribution. This difference highlights the importance of modeling the distributions of incoming and outgoing ties explicitly, as we do with the regression models below. Of course, the picture we get of the placing capacity of communication departments is artificially cropped, given the boundaries of the network. Following common practice in the literature, we only track information on placements within the field of communication in the U.S. academic market. However, if our theoretical interpretation of career paths is correct, this skewness might also result from dynamics of cumulative advantage: The more PhDs a given university places in other universities, the more likely it is to form more ties than other universities, especially as those PhDs move through their careers. We do not have temporal data, but our network snapshot condenses this historical information (or path dependence) in the form of degree distributions. The regression models below unpack this interpretation.\nThe last two panels of Figure 2 show the network with the nodes (institutions) assigned to their geographical coordinates, and sized in proportion to their capacity to place and hire PhDs (Hawaii is excluded from the maps to facilitate visualization, but included in the rest of the analyses). The two maps display the same number of nodes, but some institutions are so small in their relative capacity to place PhDs that they are not visible in the right panel. These maps not only confirm the descriptive finding that placement capacity is more unequally distributed, but also highlight the importance of controlling for node attributes when analyzing the network: Most of the ties are condensed in very specific parts of the country, which suggests that the location and geographical proximity of universities might also drive the formation of recruitment ties. The extent to which these and other node attributes help explain the distribution of hiring and placement capacity is the question that guides the analyses in the following sections. Figure 3 compares the number of faculty members with PhD degrees in disciplines other than communication. To allow a comparison with the 2007 data, we only list the top 13 disciplines (Table A1 in the Appendix displays the raw frequency numbers). As the figure shows, faculty composition in communication departments has changed substantially during the 7-year period that separates the two observations. Compared with 2007, there are more computer scientists holding positions in communication departments in 2014. This increase is likely to result from the growing prominence of digital technologies and \"big data\" research, as well as the possibility that the number of computer science PhDs exceeds what their academic market can handle. Regardless, this form of disciplinary crosspollination is more relevant today in defining the field of communication than in 2007. Figure 3 shows that the relative numbers of PhDs in psychology, political science, and science and technology have also increased. Advertising, ethnic studies, linguistics, sociology, and literature, on the Barnett et al. (2010) and our own data. Note: In the 2007 data the following disciplines had fewer than 10 faculty members and the counts were not displayed in the published article: aging, agriculture, art and design, audiology and speech, computer science, economics, engineering, family studies, geography, management, marketing, mathematics, MIS, music, planning, science and technology, and social policy."}, {"section_title": "Changes in the network (2007-2014)", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Faculty composition", "text": "other hand, have decreased. Table A2 in the Appendix lists the total counts of PhDs granted by all institutions (i.e., both those that are included and excluded from the NCA list)."}, {"section_title": "Centrality rankings", "text": "To compare the rank position of institutions in the distribution of out-degree (placing capacity) and in-degree (hiring capacity), we merged the data displayed in Table 2 of Barnett et al. with the ranks according to our sample. As our unit of analysis is institutions rather than programs, we used the rank of the highest program when the same institution was listed more than once. Figure 4 shows the correlations for the networks measured in these 2 years. The size of the bubbles is proportional to faculty size based on 2014 data.\nData points below the diagonal line represent institutions that have become more central, whereas those above the line have decreased relative centrality in the network. Overall, the scatterplots show that centrality in placement capacity has not changed much since 2007. The correlation coefficient, at .91, is high in general but specially so for the most central institutions: As the figure shows, the data points better ranked in terms of their centrality converge more clearly around the diagonal line of perfect correlation. Changes over time, however, are greater for the hiring capacity of institutions. The correlation is moderate (.59), which suggests that institutions that were central in hiring dynamics in 2007 are not necessarily so in 2014, and vice versa. "}, {"section_title": "Placement and hiring mechanisms", "text": "Descriptive results in the previous sections show that the recruitment network exhibits structural inertias in the form of reciprocity, transitivity, and popularity (which gives rise to hubs, especially in the distribution of placing capacity). Moreover, the spatial analysis also reveals geographical areas of tie density; and the longitudinal comparison suggests nontrivial changes in faculty composition, which signals shifting strategies in recruitment and, therefore, tie formation. In order to tease out how relevant each of these factors are in terms of explaining the structure of the recruitment network, we employ a modeling technique developed for the statistical analysis of networks known as exponential random graph and p* models (Robins, Pattison, Kalish, & Lusher, 2007; Snijders, van de Bunt, & Steglich, 2010; Wasserman & Pattison, 1996) . These models offer a regression framework to identify the generative mechanisms that explain the formation of ties and, by extension, the formation of networks.\nThese statistical models are similar to logistic regression in the sense that they estimate the log-odds (or probability) of an event-the event being the formation of a tie. What makes these models unique is their estimation method, which takes into account the interdependence of network data and the fact that the units of analysis are not independent observations. The models are specified to estimate the likelihood of a tie between a pair of nodes. As with other statistical techniques, theory testing comes in the form of choosing the right parameters for the model. We ran several models to assess the assumption made in prior work that recruitment ties reflect the quality of doctoral programs. Our main theoretical claim is that the network emerges from organizational inertias that are unlikely to reflect quality and respond, instead, to path dependence and cumulative advantage. To test this claim, we fit several models with two types of explanatory factors: network effects and node attributes. We test the effects of node attributes on the formation of hiring and placing ties (i.e., incoming and outgoing connections) as separate parameters."}, {"section_title": "Network effects", "text": "ERGMs try to identify the building blocks or configurations that characterize the structure of a network. The most basic parameter captures the density of the network, or the probability that a tie exists between any two nodes. This parameter acts as the constant or intercept in conventional regression models, and it restricts the theoretical space of possible networks to those that have a similar density (or number of ties) to the observed network (Lusher, Koskinen, & Robins, 2012; Morris, Handcock, & Hunter, 2008; Snijders et al., 2010) . In addition to this basic parameter, we also include the three network effects: reciprocity, transitivity, and cumulative advantage. As previously explained, we have theoretical reasons to incorporate these parameters in the model, based on prior research on interorganizational networks and labor markets.\nThe reciprocity parameter measures if mutual ties are more likely than asymmetrical ties. The tendency toward reciprocity is ubiquitous in social networks, including those linking organizations (Lusher et al., 2012; Wasserman & Faust, 1994) . In light of the trends identified in Figure 1 , we expect this effect to be positive and significant when controlling for node attributes (explained below). The transitivity parameter captures the significance of clustering as a generative network mechanism. Transitivity is another basic effect in social networks and we use a configuration that accounts for the fact that transitivity usually emerges in the form of nested structures (Hunter & Handcock, 2006) , as illustrated in Figure 1 . We expect to find a positive and significant effect, providing evidence of the path dependence created by hiring and mobility decisions that go beyond institutional attributes. Finally, for the cumulative advantage effect we introduce a popularity parameter, where popularity is measured as placing capacity or out-degree centrality, which, as Figure 2 shows, is significantly skewed and thus likely to emerge from rich-get-richer dynamics. This parameter allows us to test if nodes with high out-degrees have an extra propensity to form ties with others after controlling the effects of institutional attributes. The self-reinforcing element of this parameter is intended to reproduce the rich-get-richer effect prevalent in many social systems (Snijders et al., 2010) .\nThe selection of these three endogenous network effects is guided by the descriptive analyses of the network from the previous two sections. Those analyses suggested that, in aggregate, the network has more mutual connections and higher local clustering than a comparable random network. The distribution of centrality measures also indicated high levels of heterogeneity in tie formation, especially for out-degree or placing capacity, which exhibited more clear outliers. The regression framework allowed by ERGMs helps determine whether the explanatory relevance of these structural patterns holds once they are controlled simultaneously. In other words, these models enable us to identify the generative mechanisms of the network while taking into account the complex interdependences typical of network data."}, {"section_title": "Node attributes", "text": "The structural effects described above aim to model the endogenous factors that shape the recruitment network. Here, we also consider node-level covariates, namely institutional attributes, which are exogenous to the network but might still influence the formation of ties. First, we consider faculty size and faculty seniority measured by the average year of PhD completion. We use faculty size as a control variable because previous research suggests that it correlates with centrality measures (Barnett et al., 2010; Burris, 2004) . Larger departments or schools with more faculty members have more resources to recruit graduate students and, as a result, they can grant more PhDs and produce more graduates that can be placed in the market; they are also more likely to hire because, being larger, they tend to have more openings. In our study, faculty size is the number of tenure-track faculty members except emeritus professors. Faculty seniority, on the other hand, reflects how long a faculty member has been working in academia since they obtained their PhDs. Following our theory of mobility patterns, more experienced faculty will have more ties with other institutions, so we expect seniority to have a positive impact on the probability of placing ties; similarly, institutions with older faculty are more likely to hire, and we therefore expect seniority to have a positive effect on recruitment.\nAnother node-level attribute we consider is the geographical location of the institutions in the network. We use three parameters: The first one captures the effect of being in the same state under the intuition that proximity might make tie formation more likely; the second one reflects the effects of latitude given that Figure 2 suggests higher clustering in the north; the third one uses the rural-urban continuum codes compiled by the USDA Economic Research Service.\n3 These codes provide a classification scheme that distinguishes metropolitan and nonmetropolitan counties, with a scale that ranges from 1 to 9. In our data values range from 1 to 4; in the light of the maps in Figure 2 , we expect higher values to be negatively associated with tie formation as metropolitan areas tend to have more academic institutions. 4 Finally, we also add parameters to control for the public/private nature of universities and for whether they offer multiple PhD programs related to communication (e.g., the same institution may have separate PhD programs for journalism and health communication). These variables are introduced as controls to make sure that our decision to aggregate programs at the level of institutions does not affect our findings.\nThe final set of parameters captures different measures of prestige. First, we look at the 2010 NRC's rankings for PhD programs in communication. Compared with the older rankings (Allen, Maier, & Grimes, 2012; Neuendorf, Skalski, Atkin, Kogler-Hill, & Perloff, 2007) , the NRC ranking contains many more programs than are in the NCA list and it is richer in the dimensions it evaluates. This ranking has been employed in a prior study as a comparative benchmark for recruitment centrality measures (Barnett & Feeley, 2011) . Here, we include it as another covariate to assess its association with recruitment patterns. Although it is a more comprehensive ranking, there are still some institutions acknowledged by the NCA that do not appear in the NRC list (N = 16). We regard these as missing cases, but we assign them a rank value of 99, effectively placing them at the bottom of the distribution. As a robustness check, we examine three different variations of the NRC ranking: the R-rank (\"programs are ranked highly if they have similar features to programs viewed by faculty as top-notch\"); the research rank (\"derived from faculty publications, citation rates, grants, and awards\"); and the S-rank (\"programs are ranked highly if they are strong in the criteria that scholars say are most important\"). In addition to these measures, we also add dummies to identify universities that belong to the Ivy League, the University of California system, and the Big Ten; membership in these groups is usually regarded as an important form of prestige. Table 1 summarizes the results from some of the models we ran. Selection was driven by significance levels and a comparison of the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Consistent with our main theoretical claim, the three structural parameters remain positive and significant across model specifications. The edges parameter controls for network density; it is negative because our network is relatively sparse. Of the faculty characteristics, only seniority yields significant coefficients with a small positive effect on hiring ties. This means that the institutions or schools with more senior faculty are slightly more likely to hire, controlling for the tendency to reciprocate and other network effects. None of the other institutional characteristics has a significant effect on tie formation. Among the measures of prestige, being part of the Ivy League, the California system, or the Big Ten appears to be more important than the three rankings compiled by the NRC: All else constant, these universities are more likely to place their PhDs and less likely to hire (although the significance levels vary). Figure 5 reproduces model 6 (which has the best overall fit) to visualize the significance of the different effects. The three network effects are the most important predictors of tie formation, providing evidence that path dependence and endogenous dynamics are driving recruitment patterns. Being part of the Ivy League, the California system, or the Big Ten has also a positive effect on placing capacity, but a negative effect on recruitment. According to these estimates, which can be interpreted as conditional log-odds ratios, being an Ivy League program increases the odds of placing a PhD student by 15%; it reduces the odds of hiring from other programs by about 50%, all else being equal. The NRC rank is only marginally significant for hiring ties: As the rank position of an institution goes down the scale (i.e., it gets a higher rank position), the probability of receiving ties (or hiring) also decreases; ranking does not seem to impact placing capacity significantly. Faculty seniority, also, is only significant for hiring: For each additional year in the average seniority of faculty, the odds of hiring increase by approximately 1%. Contrary to our expectations, the effect is negative for placing capacity conditional on the other covariates, but this effect is not significant."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "To assess how well this model captures the structure of the data, the lower panels of Figure 5 show how the observed in-degree and out-degree distributions (thick black lines) compare to those in random networks simulated using the estimated Note: Coefficients in bold are significant at the 95% level."}, {"section_title": "Figure 5", "text": "Model estimates and goodness of fit assessment.

Although the goodness of fit diagnostics for ERGMs are still at their infancy (Kolaczyk & Cs\u00e1rdi, 2014) , this comparison offers the best available benchmark to assess how well the model fits the data. As the figure shows, our model replicates reasonably well the observed distributions of hiring and placing ties: They fall within the quantile curves for most of the range. The model underestimates the number of nodes with 0 out-degree (i.e., institutions which are not able to place PhDs) and it overestimates the number of nodes with average in-degree (i.e., institutions with average capacity to hire). Overall, however, the model manages to capture the shape of the distributions remarkably well."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this study, we systematically examined the recruitment network of U.S.-based universities with doctoral programs in communication. We identified a clear hierarchical pattern in the capacity of academic institutions to place their own PhDs and to hire those graduating from other institutions. We observed greater stratification in placement capacity than in hiring. Merging our data with those reported in Barnett et al.'s 2010 study, we also found that the stratification in placing capacity tends to be more stable over time, whereas rankings in hiring display more fluctuations. These findings are consistent with the stratified pattern that Barnett et al. reported in their study, as well as with the core-periphery structure identified in the recruitment networks of other disciplines (Fowler et al., 2007; Clauset et al., 2015) . However, we differ substantially in the interpretation of what those patterns reveal. We have provided evidence that counters the assumption that recruiting ties can be used as a proxy for the quality of doctoral education. As our findings suggest, there are strong network effects that account for much of the structure linking communication programs. Once these network effects are controlled for, the correlation between network centrality and reputational rankings is small. Other institutional attributes, such as faculty seniority, are more relevant to the position of institutions in the recruitment network.\nOur findings highlight the important role of network mechanisms vis-\u00e0-vis node-level attributes during the formation of recruitment ties. In line with the interorganizational literature, we interpret these network effects as path dependence of prior recruitments and dynamics of cumulative advantage. In the context of academic hiring, we consider recruitment ties as instrumental conduits through which information about potential job candidates circulates. For institutions that frequently exchange PhD graduates with one another, the recruitment network functions as a rich information repository that helps search committees reduce costs and uncertainty. This influences their decisions about future hires, which in turn reinforces the network effects.\nOur study also sheds light on the changing intellectual landscape of communication research. We observed a substantive increase in the number of faculty members with doctoral degrees in computer science as well as science and technologies. This indicates the growing visibility of research topics related to new media, and the importance of new computational methods for the collection and analysis of digital data. The data also suggest an increase in the number of faculty members with PhD degrees in political science and social psychology, which may reflect the growing influence of political and health communication in the field. At the same time, we found a drastic reduction in the number of faculty hired from advertising, education, and ethnic studies. These changes should be analyzed on a case-by-case basis: A drop in faculty numbers is not necessarily indicative of the diminished importance of a discipline within communication. What our findings highlight, however, is that the intellectual composition of communication as a discipline has evolved considerably during the past 7 years.\nThere are some limitations that deserve consideration. First, in order to engage with prior research, we have excluded hiring or placing ties associated with non-U.S. institutions. This focus on U.S.-based institutions is common in similar studies from disciplines other than communication (Bedeian et al., 2010; Burris, 2004; Fowler et al., 2007; Wiggins & Sawyer, 2012) . However, with the globalization of the academic market and an increasing worldwide exchange of faculty members, it may no longer be appropriate to artificially confine recruitment networks within national boundaries. As Table A2 in the Appendix shows, our sample contains a substantial group of faculty who obtained their doctoral degrees from non-U.S. institutions. Furthermore, given the significant number of international graduate students enrolled in U.S. doctoral programs, it is likely that some of them will seek positions in non-U.S. institutions upon graduation, thus adding measurement error to our operationalization of centrality in the recruitment network. In this regard, future research should consider expanding the scope of analysis to the international academic market to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the discipline.\nSecond, our analyses also disregard the PhDs recruited by institutions that do not offer doctoral degrees in communication. Since we used the programs listed in the NCA doctoral guide as seeds for data collection, we excluded from our empirical focus a significant number of institutions that are also shaping the field of communication. Further work should consider whether trends would look different if the network incorporated information about these nodes-which would be net receivers of ties-and might shift the distribution of centrality for the other institutions. A related question is whether the analyses with this extended network would improve correlations with the NRC rankings. Our impression is that the poor explanatory performance of this measure of prestige has to do with its lack of precision (Barnett & Feeley, 2011) , a problem that is more generally related to measurement error in surveys.\nYet another limitation is that our data only represent a temporal snapshot of the recruitment network. We focus on a single measurement of the hiring and placing interactions between the institutions where faculty members obtained their PhD degrees and those where they are currently hired. Though this is a common practice (e.g., Barnett et al., 2010; Burris, 2004; Fowler et al., 2007) , we have nevertheless simplified the career trajectories that involve multiple moves among different institutions, as well as the hiring and placing interactions during these transitions. In addition, we have not taken into account potential time-varying factors that may affect the formation of recruitment ties. For instance, the demand of the academic job market and the number of available tenure-track positions fluctuate over time for reasons that are related to the broader economic climate (as it happened in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis). To test the robustness of network mechanisms against time-varying factors, we encourage future studies to collect data on the career trajectories of faculty members and the number of tenure-track positions available at any given year.\nIn the light of these limitations, an immediate implication of our research is the need to revisit the criteria behind the NCA doctoral program guide. Our analyses reveal that this listing does not offer a comprehensive list of the institutions that are relevant for communication as a field. If the purpose of the program guide is to give useful information to prospective PhDs about career paths, then a complete list of options would better fulfill that goal. NCA should also devote some resources to document the career paths of faculty, as other professional organizations do (Fowler et al., 2007) . This would allow researchers to analyze mobility patterns and the temporal dimension of the academic labor market more explicitly, as opposed to using network snapshots to reconstruct that history of path dependence. Digital technologies make this a relatively easy endeavor: Crowdsourcing tools can now be used to elicit information on present and past positions from members of the association, perhaps as part of the registration to conferences.\nOur findings also have implications for how recruitment decisions are made. It is well known in the literature that labor markets are biased with gender and ethnic discrimination. Our results point at a more subtle form of discrimination under the form of what we could call \"alma mater\" bias or \"old boy network\" effect. On the one hand, faculty tend to give more credibility to PhDs that graduated from their alma mater because they have more information about that university and connections with their faculty. This is what the theory of interorganizational networks suggests: Those ties provide useful information to dispel part of the uncertainty involved in hiring new colleagues. On the other hand, however, these dynamics put at a disadvantage candidates who are not so well embedded in the network but who might be as competitive or deserve the position more. By making explicit this bias, measures can be put in place to prevent it from interfering with the fairness and meritocracy of the recruitment process.\nThe network effects we identify in this article accentuate the importance of active networking in academic life. They shed light into why alumni networks are such an important asset for universities and schools: They offer a pool of informational resources that are difficult to obtain otherwise. Networks facilitate referrals for job applicants and provide \"insider\" information on positions and research priorities. In order to tap into these network resources, communication departments should build and maintain a robust alumni community. Various forms of academic alliances or associations can also be forged at the institutional level to generate the sort of collaborative relationships that promote information sharing and trust building. These relationships create, over time, the connections that give access to job opportunities and exciting career moves. Wasserman, S., & Pattison, P. (1996) Source: Barnett et al.
