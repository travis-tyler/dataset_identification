[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Millions of people have been diagnosed, and hundreds of thousands have died from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) globally. (1) There is concern that patients with autoimmune diseases are at an increased risk of infection and complications, exacerbated by the nature of their disease and/or the use of immunosuppressive therapies.(2) In addition, systemic inflammation is present in many autoimmune diseases (3), leading to an increased risk of cardiovascular (3\u20135) and thromboembolic disease (6\u20138), have also been recently reported to be associated with COVID-19. In patients infected with COVID-19, worse outcomes such as hospitalisation, requiring intensive services, and death may be associated with a pro-inflammatory cytokine storm.(9\u201311) Currently identified general risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalisation include systemic autoimmune diseases amongst other comorbidities.(12, 13)\nAs having autoimmune diseases is a recognised risk factor for COVID-19 related complications (2), public health authorities around the world have advised mitigation strategies for those at risk. In the absence of a vaccine and a scarcity of proven therapeutic options, non-pharmacological measures such as shielding, case isolation, strict hand hygiene, and social distancing are key measures to protect this vulnerable group of patients.(14, 15) Thus far, characterisation studies about COVID-19 infection in people with autoimmune conditions have been limited in sample size and mostly region-specific.(12, 13, 16\u201319) As such, COVID-19 outcomes among people with autoimmune conditions remain poorly understood.\nWith the ongoing threat of COVID-19, clinical understanding of the characteristics and prognosis of patients with autoimmune conditions will facilitate the management of care for this group of patients. Given the paucity of evidence, our study aimed to describe the patients\u2019 socio-demographics, comorbidities, and 30-day complications and mortality amongst patients with prevalent autoimmune conditions hospitalised and COVID-19 across North America, Europe, and Asia. In addition, we compared their health outcomes and mortality with those seen in patients with autoimmune diseases hospitalised with seasonal influenza in the previous years."}, {"section_title": "Study design and data sources ::: Methods", "text": "We conducted a multinational network retrospective cohort study as part of the Characterizing Health Associated Risks, and Your Baseline Disease In SARS-COV-2 (CHARYBDIS) protocol.(20) At time of publication, there were 18 databases contributing to CHARYBDIS. All data were standardized to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM)(21), which allowed a federated network analysis without sharing patient-level data. In this study, we selected databases with more than 140 patients meeting our inclusion criteria to secure sufficient precision with a confidence interval width of +/\u2212 5% in the study of the prevalence of a previous condition or 30-day risk of an outcome affecting 10% of the study population.\nWe included six data sources from the US, Spain, and South Korea, including hospital out- and inpatient electronic health records (EHR) from Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) US, Optum (Optum EHR) (US), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA-OMOP) (US), primary care EHR linked to hospital admissions data from the Information System for Research in Primary Care-Hospitalisation Linked Data (SIDIAP-H) (Spain)(22), and health claims from IQVIA Open Claims (US) and Health Insurance and Review Assessment (HIRA) (South Korea).(23) A flowchart of the databases included and excluded of those available in the network is shown in Supplementary Figure 1, and a detailed description of the included databases can be found in Appendix 1."}, {"section_title": "Study participants and follow-up ::: Methods", "text": "For the COVID-19 cohort, all patients diagnosed and/or hospitalised between January and June 2020 with a clinical or laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and with one or more prevalent autoimmune diseases were included. For the influenza cohort, all patients diagnosed and/or hospitalised between September 2017 and April 2018 with a clinical or laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of influenza and with one or more prevalent autoimmune diseases were included. The index date (i.e., start time of the cohort) was the date of diagnosis or of hospital admission, respectively. All participants were required to have at least 365 days of observational data prior to the index date. Prevalent autoimmune condition was defined as patients having any of the following conditions captured in the data source, any time prior to the index date: Type 1 diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Addison\u2019s disease, Graves\u2019 disease, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, Hashimoto thyroiditis, myasthenia gravis, vasculitis, pernicious anaemia, coeliac disease, scleroderma, sarcoidosis, ulcerative colitis, or Crohn\u2019s disease.\nParticipants were followed up for the identification of study outcomes from the index date until the earliest of death, end of the study (June 2020), 30 days after index, or last date of data availability."}, {"section_title": "Baseline characteristics ::: Methods", "text": "Socio-demographics (age and sex) at index date were extracted, together with comorbidities and medicines used as recorded in the 365 days prior to the index date.

The outcomes were defined using code sets based on Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED), Current Procedural Terminology, 4th Edition (CPT), or International Classification of Diseases 9th edition (ICD-9)/10th edition (ICD-10) disease or procedure codes. Outcomes were not reported for the SIDIAP-H database as these were all hospital-based diagnoses and therefore highly incomplete in primary care EHR data. Mortality will only be reported for the following data sources which have good quality and complete data: CUIMC, HIRA, SIDIAP-H, and VA-OMOP."}, {"section_title": "Patient and public involvement statement ::: Data characterisation and analysis ::: Methods", "text": "No patients or public were involved in the design, execution, or dissemination of this study."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "We included 133,589 patients (129,221 from US, 3,553 from Spain, and 815 from South Korea) with prevalent autoimmune diseases and a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 or a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (Table 1). Patients were mainly female in CUIMC (63.8%), HIRA (63.4%), IQVIA Open Claims (60.5%), Optum EHR (65.9%) and SIDIAP-H (62.0%) but were predominantly male in VA-OMOP (88.3%), as expected given the population based on military veterans. The majority of cases were aged \u226550 years. Among these patients with autoimmune diseases who developed COVID-19, the most prevalent autoimmune conditions were psoriasis (3.5 to 32.5%), rheumatoid arthritis (3.9 to 18.9%), and vasculitis (3.3 to 17.5%). The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (25.4 to 85.2%), heart disease (32.5 to 71.1%), type 2 diabetes (21.7 to 63.3%), and hyperlipidaemia (22.7 to 59.2%). Except for HIRA, in which obesity recording rate is low, obesity was a frequently diagnosed comorbidity in all other databases (44.4 to 63.1%). The most frequently prescribed medications in the year prior to COVID-19 diagnosis across all databases were systemic antibiotics (47.2 to 84.2%), drugs used for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (39.1 to 80.6%), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) (31.3 to 77.5%).\nA total of 48,418 patients (46,721 from US, 884 from Spain, and 813 from South Korea) with autoimmune diseases were hospitalised with COVID-19 (Table 2). Patients were mainly female in CUIMC (54.8%), HIRA (63.5%), IQVIA Open Claims (54.8%), Optum EHR (59.5%), about equal proportion in SIDIAP-H (49.0%), but were predominantly male in VA-OMOP (93.2%). Majority of cases were aged \u226550 years. Among these patients with autoimmune diseases who were hospitalised with COVID-19, Type 1 diabetes was the most common autoimmune condition in the US databases (4.8 to 7.5%) whereas rheumatoid arthritis was most prevalent in HIRA (18.9%) and psoriasis in SIDIAP-H (30.7%). The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (36.5 to 93.2%), heart disease (29.0 to 83.8%), type 2 diabetes (22.4 to 74.3%), and hyperlipidaemia (27.2 to 64.5%). The most frequently prescribed medications in the year prior to hospitalisation across all databases were systemic antibiotics (52.4 to 84.0%), drugs used for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (47.9 to 80.6%), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) (33.0 to 81.5%). The list of patient characteristics is presented in Tables 1 and 2. A full list of the conditions that make up the prevalent autoimmune diseases is presented in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. A complete list of patient characteristics can be found in the aforementioned interactive web application.\nIn patients with prevalent autoimmune diseases hospitalised with COVID-19, the prevalence of hypertension (ASMD = 0.18 to 0.34), chronic kidney disease (ASMD = 0.17 to 0.25), heart disease (ASMD = 0.18 to 0.28), Type 2 diabetes (ASMD = 0.15 to 0.32), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (ASMD = 0.11 to 0.20), and use of antithrombotics (ASMD = 0.15 to 0.28) were higher as compared to the larger group of such patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (Figure 1).\nWe included 395,784 patients with prevalent autoimmune diseases (392,797 from US, 2,419 from Spain, and 568 from South Korea) diagnosed with influenza to compare the proportion of hospitalisation episodes. The proportion of hospitalisation episodes was higher in the cohort diagnosed with COVID-19 as compared to influenza (35.7% vs 23.6% [CUIMC], 36.7% vs 16.6% [IQVIA Open Claims], 23.1% vs 17.2% [Optum EHR], 27.1% vs 19.9% [VA-OMOP], 22.2% vs 12.8% [SIDIAP-H], 96.6% vs 18.0% [HIRA]) (Figure 2).\nAt 30 days post hospitalisation, the most frequent severe outcomes were related to the respiratory system, such as ARDS (2.1 to 42.8%), and pneumonia (12.6 to 53.2%) (Figure 3a). Acute kidney injury was the second most common complication, occurring in 9.9 to 31.1% of patients in US databases, and in 2.8% in HIRA. Cardiac complications were also frequent, including arrhythmia in 3.8 to 35.1% of patients, heart failure (3.9 to 24.5%), and acute myocardial infarction (2.4 to 6.3%). Sepsis occurred during hospitalisation in 4.7 to 23.5% of patients. Ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke was recorded in 1.4 to 3.4% of patients, whereas venous thromboembolic events were recorded in 1.4 to 7.7% of patients across the databases. Mortality as a proportion of those hospitalised was generally higher in the US and Spain (16.3 to 24.6%) versus South Korea (6.3%) (Figure 3b).\nCompared to 70,660 hospitalised individuals (70,184 from US, 323 from Spain, and 153 from South Korea) with influenza in previous years, patients hospitalised with COVID-19 were more likely to have higher respiratory complications such as ARDS (14.7 to 42.8% vs 16.9 to 28.7%) and pneumonia (12.6 to 53.2% vs 19.5 to 36.3%), and had a higher mortality (6.3 to 24.6% vs 2.2 to 4.4%) (Figure 4) (Supplementary table 3)."}, {"section_title": "Study limitations ::: Discussion", "text": "COVID-19 cases may be poorly recognised due to shortages in testing capabilities, but this is to some extent mitigated in our study by also including hospitalised patients with a clinical COVID-19 diagnosis. However, even untested hospitalised patients could have been missed if hospitals were understaffed and clinicians did not have time to input proper codes. A known limitation of using routinely collected data is that medical conditions may be misclassified due to erroneous entries or underestimated as they were defined based on the presence of diagnostic or procedural codes, with the absence of records indicative of absence of disease. In particular for healthcare data in the US, the capturing of codes is largely incentivised by reimbursement from insurance companies. This factor could permit miscoding of Type 2 diabetes as Type 1 and could have enriched the autoimmune disease cohort with Type 2 diabetes patients who might not have autoimmune disease. In the initial stage of the pandemic, the lack of clinical guidance combined with the lack of access to widespread testing means that only more severe patients were seen in healthcare settings. The capture of mortality data is subject to differences by database. For example, data on inpatient deaths are recorded in a hospital EHR but deaths after discharge from hospital will not be captured in such a data source. For data sources linked to primary care, outpatient death events are typically imported into a given database from a national or local death register. It is likely that mortality rates were underestimated in our study. Nevertheless, the consistency of our findings across different healthcare settings in different countries lends credence to our results."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Patients with autoimmune diseases had high rates of respiratory complications and 30-day mortality following a hospitalization with COVID-19. Compared to influenza, COVID-19 is a more severe disease, leading to more complications and higher mortality. Future studies should investigate predictors of poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients with autoimmune diseases."}]
