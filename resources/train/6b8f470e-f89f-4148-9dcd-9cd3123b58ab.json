Exploring the development of the brain from normal controls (NC) to AD is an essential part of human research. Although connections changes have been found in the development, the connection mechanism that drives these changes remain incompletely understood. The purpose of this study is to explore the connection changes in brain networks in the process from NC to AD, and uncover the underlying connection mechanism that shapes the topologies of AD brain networks. In particular, we propose a model named MINM from the perspective of topology-based mutual information to achieve our aim. MINM concerns the question of estimating the connection probability between two cortical regions with the consideration of both the mutual information of their observed network topologies and their Euclidean distance in anatomical space. In addition, MINM considers establishing and deleting connections, simultaneously, during the networks modeling from the stage of NC to AD. Experiment results show that MINM is sufficient to capture an impressive range of topological properties of real brain networks such as characteristic path length, network efficiency, and transitivity, and it also provides an excellent fit to the real brain networks in degree distribution compared to experiential models. Thus, we anticipate that MINM may explain the connection mechanism for the formation of the brain network organization in AD patients."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the primary form of dementia and the most common degenerative brain disease among older people [1] . AD patients show symptoms of a decline in memory, language, problem-solving and other cognitive functions that affects a person's ability to perform daily activities. This decline occurs because the functional connections between two brain regions involved in cognitive function have been damaged, which blocks the normally information transformation [2] [3] [4] . Although a large amount of research has been devoted to Alzheimer's disease, it is still a significant challenge to discover the underlying connection patterns that cause the alteration of functions in brain network of AD [5] [6] [7] . Addressing these problems have profound significance for a better understanding of how the abnormal interactions occur among brain regions, and it is crucial for the early detections and early treatments of AD.\nMore recently, both graph theory and mutual information (MI) have emerged as powerful and efficient mathematical techniques for investigating AD. Indeed, graph theory provides a mount of 3 of 18 are isolated and no connections exist in the initial simulation networks. Apparently, these models are not suitable for simulating the brain networks from NC to AD. Moreover, these models generate the desired synthetic networks by continually adding connections into the initial simulation networks. They have ignored the fact that the real brain networks are combining with not only emerging of new connections but also disappeared of old connections, in the development process from NC to AD [43, 44] . Therefore, models that only take adding connections into account is not realistic. To realize a better brain networks construction of AD patients, the models should consider adding and deleting connections, simultaneously.\nTaking facts as mentioned above into consideration, in this work, we proposed a network model named MINM for brain network modeling. Both MI and graph theory are taken into account to simulate the connection changes in the development of human brain networks of AD. The ultimate goal of the study is to uncover the connection mechanism that produces synthetic networks with properties similar to those of real observed brain networks topologies. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the materials and methods, including the construction of real brain network, the presentation of our proposed models MINM in detail and the evaluation of synthetic networks. Then, we show the results of our experiments in Section 3. Section 4 is devoted to performance analysis and discussion of our proposed MINM.

They are divided into three groups: normal controls (NC) group, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) group, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) group. Table 1 shows the demographic and clinical characteristics of the three groups. The NC participants were non-depressed, non-demented, and had an average MMSE score of 28.72. The MCI group had an average MMSE score of 27.68. Patients with AD had an average MMSE score of 22.36 . Each participant underwent a scan session using a 3.0T Philips MRI scanner. All the resting fMRI scans were collected axially by adopting an echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 3000 ms; echo time (TE) = 30 ms; axial slices = 48; slice thickness = 3.313 mm; slice acquisition order = sequential ascending; flip angle (FA) = 80.0 \u2022 . Participants were informed to relax their minds and keep their eyes closed during the scanning so that we can get the resting state MRIs. [46] . The data preprocessing for each resting-state scan contains the following steps: (1) To guarantee the stabilization of the magnetic field, the first ten slice time points were discarded. (2) Slice timing correction was performed to ensure all remaining time points in the correct time domain. (3) Realignment was then executed to eliminate the movement artifact in the BOLD time series. Participants whose head translation exceeded 3.0 mm and participants whose head rotation more than 3.0 \u2022 were discarded.

Second, we calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the whole-run BOLD time courses of any pairs of nodes, to obtain one 90\u00d790 inter-regional symmetric correlation matrix for each participant.

In the Connection probabilities calculation step, we compute the probability of the existence of a connection between two nodes according to the Connection probability models, i.e., ECM and MINM. In the Evolution step, connections are added into or deleted from the initial network. The modeling will not proceed to the end until a given number of connections are added, and another given number of connections are deleted successfully. The detailed network modeling steps are listed in the following: \nIt is worthwhile mentioning that we call the real brain network\u1e20 n of NC the initial network in our modeling, and call\u1e20 m and\u1e20 m the real target brain networks (TN). 2. Connection probabilities calculation: After initialization, we calculate the connection probabilities of any node pairs in\u1e20 n according to the proposed connection probabilities models introduced in the following subsection. Then, we sort each node pair in line with its connection probability. The node pair with the largest connection probability and the node pair with the smallest connection probability are recorded, respectively. 3. Evolution : Our model starts to evolve from the initial graph\u1e20 n . In each iteration, a random number is generated to decide whether to add or delete one connection in\u1e20 n . The node pair with the largest connection probability will establish a link if its two nodes disconnected with each other. Meanwhile, the node pair with the smallest connection probability will cut off its link if there is a connection between its two nodes. It should be noted that each node must have a connection to ensure the connectivity of the synthetic network. Therefore, a new pair of nodes must be chosen according to the sorted connection probabilities, if either node's connection number in the node pair is equal to 1 when deleting the link between them. We upgrade connection set in\u1e20 n at the end of this step. 4. End of the modeling: Our model runs the above steps of Connection probabilities calculation and Evolution round by round. The simulation will not proceed to the end, until \u03b1 1 connections are established and \u03b2 1 connections are deleted successfully for\u1e20 n in the stage from NC to MCI; or \u03b1 2 connections are established and \u03b2 2 connections are deleted in the stage from NC to AD.

Before introducing our model, we introduce one previous model that has been intensively investigated over recent years.\nTo explore the formation mechanism of generating human brain network topologies, V\u00e9rtes, et al. proposed the Economical Clustering Model (ECM) [26] . Their experiment results show that both the topological similarity of common neighbors (CN) and the Euclidean distance similarity between two brain regions are treated as essential impactors in brain networks modeling. The connection probability of ECM is defined in the following function:\n\u2022 Connection probability of ECM: The more common neighbors (CN) that node u and node v have, the higher topological similarity to one another [48] . The number of common neighbors between node u and node v can be described by\nwhere, \u0393(u) and \u0393(v) represent the set of neighboring nodes of node u and node v, respectively. Scaling S CN (u,v) by the Euclidean distance similarity E(u, v) between two brain regions, the ECN connection probability between node u and node v, i.e., the probability that u prefers to build the connection with v is given by\nIn this expression, P(u, v) is the connection probability of ECM. S CN\nis the contribution of the topological similarity computed by CN. The other term, E(u, v), is the contribution of the Euclidean distance similarity which represents the anatomical distance between nodes u and v. \u03b3 and \u03b7 represent the parameters of topological similarity and anatomical distance penalization, respectively. Although ECM can construct networks similar to the real target brain networks on several essential topological features, there are still two major problems that have been pointed out.\nOne problem is that ECM devotes to calculating the topological similarity between node u and node v only according to the number of their common neighbors, it does not consider the individual characteristics of node u and node v. In fact, the individual topological characteristics of node u and node v, are paramount for the formation of a connection between them. Additionally, the other problem is that ECM gives each common neighbor the same score to the topological similarity. However, various common neighbors may have different topological characteristics, i.e., degree, clustering coefficient. Therefore, they make a different contribution to establishing the connection. In this study, we propose a novel brain network model named MINM from the perspective of mutual information to solve above issues. Mutual information provides a measure of the statistical relationship between two random variables. More specifically, it is a measure of the reduction in uncertainty about one random variable given knowledge of another [32] . MINM adopts not only the individual features node u and node v, but also the topological-based mutual information of their common neighbors. The topological-based mutual information is used to make a distinguish for the different contributions of the common neighbors of the node pair (u, v) in calculating the existence probability of one connection. Moreover, higher mutual information indicates a substantial reduction in the uncertainty of the formation of a connection; otherwise, lower mutual information means a smaller probability of the existence of one connection. The question we investigate is whether the mutual information between node u and node v can be helpful for the modeling of brain networks during the evolution process from NC to AD. Next, we introduce the definitions of self-information and mutual information, and then, we give a precise definition of our proposed connection probability of MINM. Definition 1. (Self-information) The Self-information of a random variable is a function which concentrates on quantifying the information involved in the value of a random variable. Given a random variable X with a probability distribution P(X), where X takes on values in a set X = {x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n }, the self-information of the random variable can be expressed by\nDefinition 2. (Mutual information) Mutual information is a quantity that measures the amount of message which can be acquired about one random variable by observing another. Formally, the mutual information of two random variables X and Y, whose joint distribution is given by P(X, Y) can be defined as\nwhere P(X) and P(Y) represent the marginal distributions of X and Y, respectively. I(X; Y) = 0 if and only if X and Y are independent.\n\u2022 Connection probability of MINM: Given a pair of node (u, v), whose common neighbors can be represented by \u03c9 u,v = \u0393(u) \u0393(v), the connection probability of MINM between them can be given by\nwhere S MI u,v is the topological similarity between node u and node v, which represents the topology-based mutual information between them; E(u, v) is the Euclidean distance similarity, which is similar with ECM. S MI u,v can be given by\nwhere I(L 1 u,v |\u03c9 u,v ) denotes the conditional self-information of an event that there is a connection between node u and node v, whose common neighbors are known as \u03c9 u,v . From the equation (6), we can know that the smaller I(L 1 u,v |\u03c9 u,v ) is, the higher topological similarity S MI u,v is, and this indicates that a larger probability for node u and node v to establish one connection between them.\nNext, we give a comprehensive illustration about how to calculate S MI u,v . According to the definition of Mutual Information in equation (4), the topological similarity of S MI u,v can be given by\nwhere I(L 1 u,v ; \u03c9 u,v ) denotes the mutual information between two events L 1 u,v and \u03c9 u,v . L 1 u,v describes the event that there is one link between node u and node v, and \u03c9 u,v represents the event that the common neighbors between node u and node v are observed. I(L 1 u,v ; \u03c9 u,v ) evaluates the increment of the probability for the formation of one connection between node u and node v by knowing the information of their common neighbors. I(L 1 u,v ) represents the self-information of the event that node u and node v are connected. According to the definition in equation (3), I(L 1 u,v ) can be obtained by calculating the probability of p(L 1 u,v ). In this work, we assume that the common neighbors in \u03c9 u,v are independent with each other, and thus,\nGiven one common neighbor z in \u03c9 u,v , I(L 1 u,v ; z) can be estimated by calculating the average mutual information of all pairs of nodes that have node z as their neighbor in common.\nwhere \u0393(z) is the neighbor set of z; I(L 1 m,n ) represents the self-information of an event that node m and node n are connected; I(L 1 m,n |z) is used to describe the conditional self-information of the event that node m and node n are connected on the condition that node z is known as one of their common neighbors. Here, we can get\nwhere L 0 m,n represents the event that node u and node v are disconnected with each other; |E| represents the existing number of connections in the network; k m and k n denote the connection number of node m and node n, respectively.\nThen, we give an explanation of the calculation of I(L 1 m,n |z), which is described in equation (9). According to the definition of self-information, to obtain I(L 1 m,n |z) we need to calculate the p(L 1 m,n |z).\nwhere N \u2227z and N \u2228z represent the connected and disconnected link number in \u0393(z), respectively. Obviously, N \u2227z + N \u2228z = |\u0393(z)|(|\u0393(z)| \u2212 1)/2, which represents the total connections that could possibly exist within \u0393(z), then, p(L 1 m,n |z) can be described by\nwhere \u0393(z) represents neighbors set of node z, |E z | denotes the existing link number in |\u0393(z)|.

The results indicate that MINM considering both network topology-based mutual information and anatomical distance can generate synthetic networks capturing all of the key topological features of real target brain networks. Specially, MINM minimizes the difference between the synthetic network and the real brain network on properties of local efficiency (\u03be Eloc = 0.0077), global efficiency (\u03be Eglob = 0.0292), the characteristic length (\u03be L = 0.0598), and transitivity (\u03be T = 0.0010). Therefore, MINM is the best model in simulating the underlying mechanism that causes the connection changes in brain networks in the stage from NC to MCI. Moreover, we find that PA generates synthetic networks most similar with the real brain network of MCI on properties of clustering coefficient, but it fails to match real MCI networks well on transitivity (\u03be T = 0.0480). RA generates synthetic networks most similar with the real brain network of MCI on properties of modularity, but mismatch real MCI networks on properties of clustering coefficient (\u03be C = 0.0975) and local efficiency (\u03be Eloc = 0.0638). In contrast, the results also indicate that the SI of ECM is the smallest among the six topology-based models. The performance of ECM was limited primarily by mismatches in characteristic path length (\u03be L = 0.1851) and global efficiency (\u03be Eglob = 0.1413).

SI is again used to evaluate the performance of our proposed model MINM and other five known topology-based models. A random model is also performed for comparison. By comparing SI and the relative errors of different topological properties, we want to estimate the connection mechanism that causes the changes of connections in AD patients. Table 5 gives a detailed illustration of the largest SI for the six topology-based models and the Random model. The corresponding best-fitting parameters \u03bb and \u03b7 and the relative errors on the six topological properties are listed in the table. We find good correspondence between the synthetic network constructed by MINM and the real target brain network of AD on all of the key topological properties of global efficiency (\u03be Eglob = 0.0303), the characteristic length (\u03be L = 0.0253), and transitivity (\u03be T = 0.0368). Overall, the results confirm that our proposed model MINM achieves the largest SI = 3.9231 with the optimal parameters \u03bb = 0.2, \u03b7 = 1.8, which means the corresponding synthetic network is significantly more AD-like than either of the other topological models previously considered.

Another finding is that the synthetic network generated by PA has the clustering coefficient and modularity that match exactly with that of the real brain network of AD. \u03be Eloc of the synthetic network generated by RA is the closest to the real target brain network. However, the synthetic network fails to match the real network well regarding modularity (\u03be M = 0.1370) and the characteristic path length (\u03be L = 0.0732).

ECM has the worst performance in simulating the global efficiency (\u03be Eglob = 0.1413), and it gets the smallest SI among the six topology-based models.

In the study of graph theory, the degree of a node indicates the connections number it has to other nodes. The node degree describes the characteristic of the network from the view of local structures. The degree distribution is the probability distribution of these degrees over the whole network. It makes an evaluation of the structural and dynamical properties in the network from a global view. Therefore, it is necessary to make a detailed illustration of the degree distribution of the synthetic networks in the current study. Figure 4 shows the fitting results of the cumulative degree distribution of both the real target brain networks (TN) of MCI and AD, and synthetic networks generated by the topology-based models in the simulation of two specified stages, i.e., the stage from NC to MCI and the stage from NC to AD. Figure 4 (a) demonstrates the fitting results of the cumulative degree distribution for synthetic networks generated in the stage from NC to MCI, and the real MCI network in a log-log plot. Figure  4(b) shows the fitting results of the cumulative degree distribution for synthetic networks generated in the stage from NC to AD, and the real AD network. Both of the results show that the generated topologies of MINM are approximately the same as the real target brain networks (TN) of MCI and AD. Additionally, the results indicate that a significant difference exists between the synthetic network generated by the Random model and the real target brain networks (TN). We subsequently investigate the influence of the variety of parameters \u03bb and \u03b7 on the topological properties in the modeling stage from NC to AD. Figure 5(a),(b) ,(c) describe the changes of the topological properties with \u03b7, when \u03bb = 0.2 is a constant. An interesting finding is that the clustering coefficient, local efficiency, characteristic path length, and transitivity are increasing with a gradual increase of \u03b7. These properties get the largest values when \u03b7 = 1.8, which is consistent with the observation from the results in Table 5 . It is worthwhile mentioning that modularity and the global efficiency do not change a lot with the increase of \u03b7, which confirms that the anatomical distance makes little influence on these two features. Additionally, we also investigate the topological properties of the networks by varying \u03bb with \u03b7 = 1.8. As can be seen from Figure 6(d) ,(e),(f), we observe a decreasing trend in clustering coefficient, local efficiency, characteristic path length, and transitivity with the increase of \u03bb from 0.2 to 2.0. Especially, these properties get the largest values when \u03bb = 0.2, which indicates a good agreement with the results in Table 5 . It is interesting to note that both the modularity and global efficiency have little change with the increase of \u03bb, which confirms that the topological similarity makes little influence on these two features.

We demonstrate that the addition of the topological-based mutual information to the model, favoring additional formation of connections between two nodes, can markedly improve the simulation of realistic brain network properties. Notably, our proposed model MINM provides a good account of network properties regarding local efficiency, global efficiency, the characteristic path length, and transitivity. MINM also provides an excellent fit to the degree distribution in both simulation stages of MCI and AD. Therefore, we confirm that MINM is the promising method for understanding the underlying mechanism that shapes the organization of brain networks during the development of AD.\nWe have intensively studied the topology differences between functional brain networks of NC and AD, and significant alterations of topological properties have been found, i.e., the increase of characteristic path length, the decrease of network efficiency. Specifically, the increasing of the characteristic path length indicates a long average time in dealing with the information transmission among brain areas; and the dropping down of both local efficiency and global efficiency implies the reduction of the ability in data processing. The alterations of these properties are related to the functional decline of cognition in AD patients, which is consistent with the results in literature [43] and [44] . These previous works have shown that the abnormal alterations of networks topologies play vital roles in the influence of cognitive functions such as attention, working memory and executive control of human brains during the neuro-development. The disorder of network organizations will lead to the deficit of cognition and result in the emergence of AD. Therefore, the better understanding of the topological characteristics the more helpful for us to know the relationship between the functions and the architectures of AD brain networks.\nIn the current work, we study the changes of network properties for a further investigation of the fundamental rule that causes the formation of AD network topologies. Prior models such as ECM, AA, and PA, estimated the connection mechanism of the brain networks formation by emphasizing the importance of increasing connections among brain regions [26] , [27] . Although the authors have confirmed that synthetic networks generated by these models can well match several properties of the real target brain networks, such an effort is accompanied by much debate in recent years in the simulation of the development process of AD. One obvious limitation of previous models is that they ignore the fact that the alterations in AD brain networks are caused by both decreasing and increasing connections between brain regions [43] , [44] . As a consequence, previous models can not successfully identify the potential mechanism that results in the variation of network topologies in the development from NC and MCI, or NC and AD. It is worthwhile mentioning that our proposed model MINM takes both decrease and increase of connections among brain regions into account, and this consideration is much suitable for the actual situation of AD. Thus, it gets good performance in the modeling of AD brain networks.\nIt is also clear that mutual information has been extensively investigated in human brain research. The previous study has demonstrated that mutual information is associated with the cognitive functions of human brain networks [38] [39] [40] . Also, much work has suggested that mutual information makes a crucial influence on information transmission in brain networks [36] . Therefore, topological-based mutual information is considered an essential factor in MINM to make the modeling more efficiently. MINM can make an appropriate distinguish of the connection probabilities between any two pairs of nodes by considering the topological-based mutual information. This consideration may make it much reasonable for capturing the potential connection mechanism that shapes the topologies of AD brain networks. Experimental results are shown in both Table 4 and Table 5 . On the basis of our findings, it can be concluded that our proposed topological-based mutual information model MINM can make a complete understanding of the connection mechanism that causes the formation of AD networks. Furthermore, we know that our proposed model MINM can generate networks with a better simulation in network properties of global efficiency and transitivity in both modeling stage from NC to MCI and from NC to AD. It means that the synthetic network has the same ability as the real ones in dealing with the global information transformation.\nWe have discussed several competitive models which take both topological similarity and distance penalization into consideration in this work. We make a further analysis of the influence of different topological structures on the reconstruction of AD brain networks. In the ECM model, two nodes get higher connection probability if they share more nearest neighbors in common. The PA model considers node degree of one node when calculating the connection probability, and the node with a large degree, i.e., the hub node, has more opportunity to establish connections with others. While, AA, RA, and JC are similar with ECM, they all take the number of common neighbors into consideration when calculating the connection probability between two nodes. Especially, both AA and RA take the individual characteristic of the node, i.e., node degree into account besides the common neighbors. Whereas JC defines the topological similarity for connection establishment with the consideration of not only the number of the common neighbors of two nodes, but also their union neighbor set. As can be seen from Table 4 and Table 5 , all the topological-based models can generate synthetic networks much more similar to the real target brain networks than the Random model. Moreover, we can also know that models taking different topological structures into account generate various network topologies which present their characteristics. Additionally, through comparing SI of MINM to those of other topological-based models, we confirm that MINM achieves the best performance in generating synthetic networks with properties most resemblance to those of the real AD brain network, with the best fitting parameters \u03bb and \u03b7 estimated by simulated annealing (SA). We devote our effort to propose an explicit simulation model for a complete understanding of the connection mechanism that results in the network topologies of AD. Also, our results reveal that the formation of the AD topologies is not randomly, it follows an appropriate rule. Our findings draw attention to the critical requirement for a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the connection mechanism and the functions of the brain networks."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In conclusion, we have investigated how topological-based mutual information and Euclidean distance are adopted in the simulation of brain network topologies with AD.

Our ambition is to uncover the fundamental connection mechanism that facilitates the alterations of brain networks in the development from NC to AD. We have demonstrated that by adding the mutual information into our model can promote the modeling performance in this development. Successful models of AD brain networks have been instrumental in understanding how structural brain organizations affect the ability of cognition.
