In patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), reductions of gray matter volume, mainly in the medial temporal structures, have been reported; however, inhomogeneity and geometric distortion of the field intensity hampers the reproducibility of MRI. In the present study, we developed a novel computed tomography (CT)-based VBM method and used this technique to detect volume loss in AD patients as compared with normal controls. The results were compared with MRI-based VBM using the same subjects. Pittsburgh Compound B ( 11 C-PIB) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT was performed and two experts in neuro-nuclear medicine judged whether regional amyloid b load was consistent with a diagnosis of AD. Before the injection of 11 C-PIB, highquality CT scans were obtained using the same PET/CT equipment. MRI was performed within a mean interval of 25.1 AE 8.2 days before the PET/CT scan. Using statistical parametric mapping 8 (SPM8), the extracted gray matter images from CT and MRI were spatially normalized using a gray matter template and smoothed using a Gaussian kernel. Group comparisons were performed using SPM8 between five 11 C-PIB-positive patients with probable AD and seven 11 C-PIB-negative age-matched controls with normal cognition. Gray matter volumes in the bilateral medial temporal areas were reduced in the AD group as compared with the cognitively normal group in both CT-based VBM (in the left; P < 0.0001, cluster size 2776 and in the right; P < 0.0001, cluster size 630) and MRI-based VBM (in the left; P < 0.0001, cluster size 381 and in the right, P < 0.0001, cluster size 421). This newly developed CT-based VBM technique can detect significant atrophy in the entorhinal cortex in probable AD patients as previously reported using MRI-based VBM.

Morphologically, brain structures consist mainly of gyri and sulci, with these structures being quite common in human beings. This simplicity makes it easier to normalize the brain to an anatomically standardized space and to introduce voxel-based statistical analysis. Histologically, the majority of brain tissue consists of gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid space. Gray matter thickness reflects the number of residual neurons. Commonly, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to derive anatomical and tissue volume information, especially in gray and white matter.\nThe voxel-based morphometry (VBM) technique objectively maps gray matter loss on a voxel-by-voxel basis after anatomic standardization. This is one of the simplest methods available to avoid subjectivity and dependence on an a priori hypothesis and to adopt the principle of data-driven analysis (Ashburner and Friston 2000) . In patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), a significant reduction of gray matter volume in the hippocampal formation and entorhinal cortex has been described (Ohnishi et al. 2001; Hirata et al. 2005) . For the voxel-wise comparison of gray matter between two groups of subjects, MRI has been used as a matter of course.\nIn the present study, we developed a novel computed tomography (CT)-based VBM (CT-VBM) technique. Brain CT has more homogeneity and much less distortion than MRI, even when using different machines or scan protocols. It is also relatively economical and widely available. Moreover, nowadays, CT data are easily available from a routine positron emission tomography (PET)/CT study.

A priori gray matter images in SPM8 were used as a standard template. The gray matter images were then smoothed with a 12-mm, full-width half-maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel to use the partial volume effect to create a spectrum of gray matter intensities. The gray matter densities are equivalent to the weighted average of gray voxels located in the volume fixed by the smoothing kernel; therefore, regional intensities can be taken as being equivalent to gray matter volumes (Ashburner and Friston 2000; Ohnishi et al. 2001 )."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "The processed images were analyzed using SPM8, which implements the general linear model. Global gray matter in the images was treated as a nuisance confounder. Proportional scaling was used to achieve global normalization of voxel values between the images. In the analysis of patients with AD, we studied the differences in the gray matter between the cognitively normal controls versus AD patients using t statistics. The resulting sets of t values constituted statistical parametric maps: SPM (t), which were transformed to the unit normal distribution (SPM [Z] ). Group analysis of gray matter volume between the AD patients and cognitively normal controls was performed using a spatial extent threshold of 123 (984 mm 3 ) for CT-VBM and 381 (3048 mm 3 ) for MRI-VBM contiguous voxels.

The most significant atrophy was observed in the left hippocampus."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In AD patients, both CT-VBM and MR-VBM demonstrated significant atrophy in the left entorhinal cortex and hippocampus and in the right entorhinal cortex or hippocampus with left-side dominancy. Our hypothesis was that, even with the gray matter segmented from CT and not from MRI, the characteristic medial temporal lobe atrophy of AD patients can be detected using the VBM procedure. This hypothesis was proved in this study.\nNumerous structural MRI studies have demonstrated that atrophy of the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, is a sensitive marker of early AD (Killiany et al. 2000; Du et al. 2001) . Both the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus are essential parts of the medial temporal lobe system that supports declarative memory. Neuronal loss in AD is thought to start in the entorhinal cortex and spread to other regions, such as the hippocampus (Braak and Braak 1991) . Guo et al. (2010) observed gray matter volume in 13 AD patients and 14 healthy controls using MRI. In their analysis of gray matter volume, the left parahippocampal gyrus showed more significant atrophy than the right. Shi et al. (2009) found left-less-than-right asymmetry patterns by comparing hippocampal volume. These investigations seem to be in good agreement with the present results of left-side dominant atrophy.\nAs a result, the gray matter atrophy in AD patients observed using CT-VBM was found to be more widespread than that observed using MR-VBM. Atrophy in the right caudate head, left anterior cingulate, and right temporal pole was only observed using CT-VBM in this study. In contrast to its precise spatial and tissue resolution, MRI shows deterioration in field intensity inhomogeneity and geometric distortion depending on factors such as the machines and sequences used and the position of the brain in the coil. Because this intensity inhomogeneity affects many automatic quantitative image analyses, various algorithms for correction have been introduced (Sled et al. 1998; Arnold et al. 2001 ). On the contrary, brain CT has more homogeneity and much less distortion than MRI, even when using different machines or scan protocols. This increased homogeneity and reduced distortion may result in more sensitivity. There is another possibility that the segmentation parameter could contribute to the difference of CT and MR to a certain extent. This new method should be confirmed with more subjects and diagnostic accuracy should be measured.\nAtrophy in the temporal pole and anterior cingulate have been reported by MRI-based VBM (Karas et al. Locations of gray matter volume reductions in AD patients compared with cognitively normal controls. CT-VBM, computed tomography-based voxel-based morphometry; AD, Alzheimer's disease.\n2003; Guo et al. 2010 ). These areas are also known to be pathologically involved in AD, where both amyloid deposition and neurofibrillary changes are observed (Braak and Braak 1991) . The caudate head is known as a site at which amyloid and tau deposits also accumulate (Braak and Braak 1991) . Madsen et al. (2010) showed a reduction of caudate volume in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and a further reduction in AD patients. They also showed a greater volume of the right caudate than the left caudate in cognitively normal controls and MCI subjects and twofold greater atrophy in the right caudate than in the left caudate in AD patients. They suggested that a possible confounding factor in some VBM studies of the caudate could result in the misregistration of anatomy across subjects along the ventricles. From our results, it was suggested that some artificial factors like cerebrospinal fluid flow may generate a confounding factor in MR-VBM; however, these are not detected on CT images."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The present study modified a conventional VBM procedure using brain CT instead of MRI to detect significant atrophy in AD patients.

At the present time, though, complementary use of CT-VBM and MR-VBM is desirable, and for clinical use, a simpler and proper program for CT-VBM or an advanced scanning technique for more precise tissue contrast without heavier radiation exposure would be desirable, our results suggest that CT-VBM has the potential to replace MR-VBM for diagnosing AD."}]
