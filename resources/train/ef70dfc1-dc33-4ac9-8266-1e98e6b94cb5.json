[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is clinically characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Mutations in amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2) are the pathogenic cause of autosomal dominant AD (ADAD). However, polymorphisms also exist within these genes. Methods: In order to distinguish polymorphisms from pathogenic mutations, the DIAN Expanded Registry has implemented an algorithm for determining ADAD pathogenicity using available information from multiple domains, including genetic, bioinformatic, clinical, imaging, and biofluid measures and in vitro analyses. Results: We propose that PSEN1 M84V, PSEN1 A396T, PSEN2 R284G, and APP T719N are likely pathogenic mutations, whereas PSEN1 c.379_382delXXXXinsG and PSEN2 L238F have uncertain pathogenicity."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized clinically by progressive cognitive decline and neuropathologically by progressive neuronal loss and the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Mutations in amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1) and presenilin 2 (PSEN2) are the pathogenic cause of autosomal dominant AD (ADAD). More than 200 pathogenic mutations have been identified in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 (reviewed in [1, 2] ). PSEN1 and PSEN2 form the catalytic domain of the \u03b3-secretase complex, which is involved in sequential cleavage of APP into amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides.\nThe Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) is an observational study designed to follow families with mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 that cause ADAD [3] . The DIAN Expanded Registry (DIAN EXR; www.dianexr.org) is a web-based registry with global outreach to ADAD families and investigators. It functions to identify families with ADAD and to determine the causative mutations through a genetic discovery program. This program includes genetic counseling and testing for known and unknown causes of ADAD. During a period of 6 years (2011 to 2017), the DIAN Clinical/Genetics committee reviewed 150 pedigrees, 76 of which were approved for genetic counseling and testing. Forty-six probands were positive for a coding variant in APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2, including 39 individuals with known pathogenic mutations, 6 with variants of unknown pathogenic significance, and 1 variant that was determined to be an AD risk factor.\nIn some cases, families are identified with several generations of early-onset AD; however, at the time of enrollment, whether a pathogenic mutation is the cause of disease in these families remains unknown. We performed genetic analyses in research participants from six densely affected early-onset AD pedigrees and identified variants in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 with unknown pathogenicity. In all families examined, we lacked sufficient genetic material to perform segregation analyses (e.g., DNA was available from only one or two family members). To assess the pathogenicity of novel variants in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 when pedigree and clinical data are limited or incomplete, Guerreiro and colleagues [4] proposed a pathogenicity algorithm. In the present study, we modified and expanded this algorithm to evaluate the pathogenicity of these six variants using genetic, biochemical, biomarker, and clinical data."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Genetic screening", "text": "Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes using standard protocols.

Sequencing of the proband revealed a single base substitution (ATG to GTG) at codon 84 in exon 4 of PSEN1, resulting in a methionine-to-valine change (M84V). PSEN1 M84V was also identified in a family-based sequencing study of AD (National Institute of Mental Health Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Initiative Study) [15] . Two PSEN1 M84V carriers were confirmed to have had AD at autopsy with ages at symptomatic onset of 70 and 72 years. The third carrier was cognitively normal at age 67 years [15] .\nTo determine whether PSEN1 M84V represents a rare polymorphism, we examined two population-based exome sequencing databases (Table 1) . PSEN1 M84V was absent from both EVS and ExAC. PSEN1 M84L was identified in one individual in the ExAC browser. PSEN1 M84V was also absent in more than 1700 AD and control samples with whole-exome sequencing.\nCSF A\u03b2, total tau, and phosphorylated tau were measured in the PSEN1 M84V carrier, who was cognitively normal at the time of lumbar puncture. CSF A\u03b2 (361.5 pg/ml), total tau (84.93 pg/ml), and p-tau 181 (22.02 pg/ml) at 11 years prior to the parental age at symptomatic onset was consistent with other presymptomatic pathogenic mutation carriers but not completely distinct from noncarriers [3, 6] . The PSEN1 M84V carrier produced a mean cortical PiB SUVR value of 1.132 at 15 years prior to the parental age at symptomatic onset and 1.209 at 11 years prior to parent age of disease onset (Fig. 2) . A related noncarrier was imaged at 16 years prior to the parent age of disease onset and produced mean cortical PiB SUVR values of 1.086 and 1.039 at 13 years prior to age at disease onset in the parent (Fig. 2) . Thus, fluid and imaging biomarkers were consistent with those observed in presymptomatic ADAD mutation carriers.\nWe next sought to determine whether the PSEN1 M84V variant alters A\u03b2 isoform levels in a manner consistent with previously reported pathogenic PSEN1 mutations. We expressed vectors containing PSEN1 WT, A79V (a known pathogenic mutation), and M84V in N2A695 cells. We found that cells expressing PSEN1 M84V produced significantly more A\u03b2 42 than cells expressing PSEN1 WT (Fig. 3a-c) . We also observed a significant increase in the A\u03b2 42 /A\u03b2 40 ratio in cells expressing PSEN1 M84V or the pathogenic PSEN1 A79V-compared with PSEN1 WT-expressing cells (Fig. 3c) .\nThus, we can apply a pathogenicity algorithm, modified from Guerreiro and colleagues [4] , to assess the pathogenicity of PSEN1 M84V (Fig. 4) . PSEN1 M84V occurs within exon 4 and the first transmembrane domain. This residue is highly conserved between PSEN1 and PSEN2 [16] . Additionally, a pathogenic mutation has been reported at this site: \u0394I83/M84 [17, 18] . In a cell model, A\u03b2 levels were consistent with pathogenic mutations (Fig. 3a-c, g ). Thus, PSEN1 M84V satisfies all criteria for pathogenicity based on residue and A\u03b2 levels [4] .

This algorithm was adapted and modified from a pathogenicity algorithm originally proposed by Guerreiro and colleagues [4] . We have expanded upon this algorithm in several important ways: (1) expanding the number of controls in the association analyses from 100 to 65,000 by exploiting the EVS and ExAC databases; (2) evaluating the bioinformatic functional findings (e.g., conservation between PSEN1 and PSEN2 and the presence of other mutations at the same residue) independent of the cell-based functional findings; and (3) incorporating cell-based assays to evaluate the impact of novel variants on A\u03b2 levels. We propose that this modified approach to assessing pathogenicity provides an important pipeline for incorporating mutation data at several levels and that this algorithm may be adapted to impute pathogenicity when extensive genetic data are missing for affected families. Designation of a variant as pathogenic will allow individuals to enroll in observational and clinical trials for AD, with clear applications in clinical and research settings."}]
