[{"section_title": "", "text": "Like the prices of many other agricultural commodities, the price of wheat rose to record highs during 2008 (fi g. 1). Low stocks and adverse weather conditions around the world tightened global supplies of wheat in 2007. This, in turn, boosted foreign demand for U.S. wheat. Supplies were high in 2007/08 relative to levels in previous years. The resulting increase in U.S. wheat exports (the highest in 15 years) depleted the surplus U.S. supply, contributing to the lowest ending stocks since the late 1940s. These and other factors helped account for the sharp increase in U.S. wheat prices in 2008. The farm-gate season average price rose to $6.48 per bushel in 2007/08, besting the previous high of $4.55 per bushel in 1995/96. Though U.S. wheat prices have fallen since spring 2008, they remain high by historical standards. The season-average price range forecast by USDA for the 2008/09 marketing year is $6.70 to $6.90 per bushel. 1 In part, prices received by U.S wheat producers have remained high because of the large quantity of wheat that was forward priced during spring 2008, when prices were very high. Also, part of the wheat crop was marketed early in the market year before prices started to drop. Rapidly rising input costs offset this unprecedented runup in wheat prices for producers. USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service reports that prices paid for production inputs have been rising since 2004, particularly for fuel and fertilizer (fi g. 2). The pace of the increase for these two inputs accelerated in 2008. U.S. energy prices rose to historical highs in 2008, a refl ection of rising international energy prices and the low value of the U.S. dollar. Both fuel and fertilizer prices have come down in recent months but remain high. Rising energy prices have contributed to higher fertilizer prices, directly through high prices for the natural gas used to produce ammonia and indirectly through higher transportation costs. Fertilizer prices also have been affected by the rapidly rising demand for fertilizers, especially in China, 1 USDA, World Agricultural Outlook Board, World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimate, February 10, 2009.  India, and Brazil. Finally, the fall in the value of the U.S. dollar in recent years has raised the price of imported energy and fertilizer for U.S. farmers. The United States imports over half of its nitrogen and over 90 percent of its potash used each year. Prices paid index for selected farm inputs In the traditional wheat-growing areas of the Plains, there is a more-than-20-year trend in some States to reduce area fallowed by planting alternative crops and lengthening crop rotations. For example, in western Kansas, the historical wheat/fallow rotation has been most commonly replaced by a rotation of wheat/grain sorghum/fallow in which wheat is planted once every 3 years rather than once every 2 years. Though cropping intensity increases under this type of system, wheat is not favored."}, {"section_title": "Wheat and Input Prices Are Up", "text": "In some of the largest wheat-growing States, producers are increasingly planting more profi table crops, such as corn and soybeans, on acreage traditionally planted to wheat. For example, in the early 1980s, wheat accounted for 80-90 percent of the total wheat, corn, and soybean acres planted in Kansas and North Dakota. In recent years, wheat's share in these States has dropped to 57-62 percent of the total (fi g. 4). Genetic gains for competing crops on the Plains. Loss of wheat acreage to row crops, such as corn and soybeans, on the Plains partly refl ects strong genetic improvements in those crops (fi g. 5). New varieties of corn and soybeans can be planted farther west and north in U.S. areas with drier conditions or shorter growing seasons. Plus, herbicide-resistant varieties make it easier for farmers to control weeds (see www.ers.usda.gov/briefi ng/biotechnology/ for more information). The pace of genetic improvement has been slower for wheat than for some other fi eld crops, resulting in little growth in wheat yields. This makes wheat a less attractive option for farmers. Genetic improvement for wheat has been slower because of genetic complexity and because of lower potential returns Wheat planted area as a share of planted area of wheat, corn, and soybeans in Kansas and North Dakota to commercial seed companies, which discourages investment in research. For example, farmers are accustomed to buying seed corn each year because seed saved from a hybrid cannot be used for a subsequent crop. This creates a large annual market for seed companies. In contrast, many wheat farmers, particularly in the Plains States, use saved seed from the previous year's crop rather than buy new seed from dealers every year. This practice sharply reduces the potential market for branded commercial seed wheat. Wheat disease also a factor. Concerns about wheat disease outbreaks in the Northern Plains, particularly scab (head blight) in North Dakota and Minnesota (caused by the fungus Fusarium graminearum), infl uenced planting decisions in the 1990s and will likely do so in the future. The increased incidence of scab may stem in part from larger corn plantings and minimum tillage practices in the region's traditional wheat-growing areas. Both activities can introduce hosts for disease-causing organisms. Ethanol expansion in the United States. The large expansion in ethanol production in the United States is affecting virtually every aspect of the fi eld crops sector, ranging from domestic crop use and exports to prices and the allocation of acreage among crops. Many aspects of the livestock sector are affected, too. For example, ethanol byproducts are substituting for corn and other feeds in livestock rations. Cellulosic sources of feedstocks for ethanol production hold some promise for the future, but the primary feedstock in the United States is currently corn. Market adjustments to this increased demand extend well beyond the corn industry to supply and demand for other crops, such as wheat. Adjustments in the agricultural sector are already underway and will continue for many years as interest grows in alternative sources of energy. Indices of North Dakota crop yields (3-year averages) In any year, adverse weather, disease, or insects may lead to a crop loss and revenue returns that do not cover production expenses. This type of revenue loss occurs from time to time in agriculture. However, if revenues do not cover production costs repeatedly, farmers may be forced to switch to alternative crops with higher returns in order to stay in business. This study's cost and returns analysis of the U.S. wheat sector provides a snapshot of the range of production expenses across the United States and compares this range with the national season average price that farmers received for wheat. This comparison allows for a sectoral overview of the proportion of U.S. wheat producers covering their production costs. If a signifi cant share of U.S. wheat producers are not covering production costs, U.S. planted area will likely continue its long-term decline. USDA's 2004 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) provides the most recent data on U.S. wheat production costs (see box, \"USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey\"). 2 The wide variation of wheat production costs across the country captured by the survey refl ects the differences in cropping practices, yields, and costs of land, labor, and capital assets. Production costs used in this analysis are the sum of operating costs of inputs and ownership costs related to capital assets that are used during the production process. Ownership costs include the annualized costs of maintaining the capital investment in farm machines (depreciation and interest). Operating and ownership costs do not include the opportunity costs for other resources, such as the farmer's labor and land (see box, \"Enterprise Costs of Production\"). Opportunity costs for these resources are not likely to infl uence planting decisions in the short term but may ultimately affect farmers' decisions to switch to other crops or pursue off-farm income. The yields used in this analysis are normal yields per planted area. The normal yield is the ARMS-reported yield that farmers expected at the time of planting. Most farmers budget for the crop season based on the expected yield for each crop they grow. This analysis uses normal yields rather than actual yields to neutralize the effects of unexpected high yields due to favorable weather conditions or yield loss or even crop abandonment due to adverse weather conditions for a particular producer in the year of the survey. Normal yields are also used later in this report in ERS's comparison of actual 2004 costs and 2008 forecasted costs. 2 Seventeen wheat-producing States were included in the survey. Respondents to the 2004 ARMS wheat survey used in this analysis represented 168,392 farms, or 44.8 million acres of the 59.6 million acres planted to wheat in 2004."}, {"section_title": "Covering Production Costs Essential to the Long-Term Sustainability of U.S. Wheat Sector", "text": "The farm-level data used in this study were derived from USDA's 2004 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) of wheat farms.

Among all operating cost items, fertilizer accounted for the largest share (45 percent) of total operating costs forecast for 2008 (table 1). Fuel, lube, and electricity accounted for the next largest share (18 percent). Ownership costs are forecast to average $68.08 per acre in 2008, while the addition of opportunity costs for land, unpaid labor, and general overhead raise the average total to $287.33 per acre. 1 Low-cost = The 25 percent of producers with the lowest operating plus ownership costs per bushel."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of the Variation Around the Average Cost of Production", "text": "2 Mid-cost = The 50 percent of producers in the midrange of operating plus ownership costs per bushel. 3 High-cost = The 25 percent of producers with the highest operating plus ownership costs per bushel. Source: USDA, Economic Research Service using data from USDA's 2004 Agricultural Resource Management Survey for wheat. Based on the 2004 normal yield of 48.8 bushels per planted acre, the forecasted 2008 operating cost per bushel is estimated to be $2.84 per bushel. The addition of ownership costs and other costs increase the total forecasted 2008 costs to $5.89 per bushel. This amount is well below the season average price range of $6.70 to $6.90 as forecast by USDA for the 2008/09 marketing year, indicating that, on average, wheat farmers should be able to cover their costs of production in 2008. The variation of costs around the average can be shown by arranging wheat farms with the lowest to highest costs per bushel to form a cumulative distribution of farms (fi g. 6). A cumulative distribution of forecasted operating and ownership costs for 2008 reveals that 25 percent of the producers had costs of $3.20 per bushel or less, and 75 percent had costs of $5.17 per bushel or less. Analysis using the categories in fi gure 6 reveals a wide range around the average of $4.24 per bushel for total operating and ownership costs (see table 1). The average operating and ownership costs per bushel for low-cost producers is forecast at $2.60 per bushel in 2008, $4.60 per bushel lower than the average forecast for the high-cost group. Lower operating costs per bushel account for most of the gap in total cost between low-cost and highcost groups of producers in the survey. High-cost producers had both higher operating and ownership costs per acre than low-cost producers in 2008. Much of these higher operating costs stems from higher expenditures for fuel, lube, and electricity and for fertilizer on irrigated acres. Ownership costs are also higher for the high-cost group due to higher capital recovery costs, again, due to irrigation. Less than 3 percent of the total wheat acreage cropped by low-cost producers is irrigated. By comparison, more than 13 percent of the total wheat acreage cropped by high-cost producers is irrigated. These irrigated wheat acres are concentrated in parts of the Pacifi c Northwest and in California and Arizona. Yield difference is another part of the cost-per-bushel calculation. The normal yield for the low-cost group is 6.6 bushels per planted acre higher than that for the high-cost group. Analysis of the cumulative, per bushel cost of U.S. wheat production in 2004 compared with that forecasted for 2008 shows that the higher expected prices for the 2008/09 marketing year increase the percentage of farmers who will cover these costs. The 2004/05 season-average price for wheat was $3.40 per bushel. This price level covered the per bushel production cost for 82 percent of the farms in the survey (fi g. 7). A price of $5.67 per bushel is needed to get an equivalent coverage using the forecasted 2008 cumulative distribution. The analysis for the forecasted 2008 cumulative distribution using the midpoint of the USDA February forecasted price range for 2008/09 shows that 90 percent of the farmers in the survey will be able to cover their per bushel costs of production. If farm-gate prices continue to fall into 2009, and if prices for fuel and fertilizer do not drop off similarly, many more wheat producers will fi nd themselves unable to cover all of their costs and the U.S. wheat sector may see continued attrition of planted area.
