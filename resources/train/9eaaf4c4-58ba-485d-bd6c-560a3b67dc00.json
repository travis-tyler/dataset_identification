Who Makes the Cut: By Gender, Race-Ethnicity, Socio-Economic Status and Type of School? More females excelled in grades, with 22.5 percent of females compared to 15.3 percent of males achieving GPAs of 3.5 or higher. hi contrast, males were more likely to achieve high SAT scores, with 26.7 percent of males compared to 18.0 percent of females with SAT scores of 1100 or higher. While the percentages of males and females for each of the three remaining criteria were roughly comparable; the net effect shown was that 6.9 percent of the collegebound females met all five criteria, compared to 4.7 percent of the college-bound males. The percentage of college-bound seniors who achieved GPAs of 3.5 or more, or SAT scores of 1100 or more was higher for Asian and white students than for Hispanic, black, or Native American students. Approximately one-fourth of all college-bound Native American students took all of the courses specified in the highly selective criteria, compared to about one-half of the Hispanic, black, white, and Asian students. Relatively more Asian and white college-bound seniors met all five highly selective criteria compared to Hispanic, black, and Native American students. College-bound seniors from the high socio-economic status (SES) level were more likely than their contemporaries at middle or low SES levels to meet any of the highly selective criteria for GPA, SAT scores, or courses taken.' The same patterns were evident when students in the middle SES level were compared with students at the low SES group level. Similarly, the percentage of college-bound seniors meeting all five criteria was highest among students at the high SES level (8.8 percent), intermediate among students in the middle SES level (4.1 percent), and lowest among the students at the low SES group level (1.5 percent). Comparisons of the performance of students at public schools, Catholic schools and all other private schools showed that approximately one-half of the collegebound seniors attending schools in the group identified as \"all other private schools\" scored 1100 or higher on the SAT (52.6 percent); while about 20 percent of their peers at public and Catholic schools achieved this level.'

Lowering the Cut: How Many More College-Bound High School Seniors Meet Less Restrictive Criteria?

Because of this finding, the effect of lowering the cutpoints for these two criteria was considered (table 2). When the cutpoint for the SAT score was lowered from 1100 to 950, with the other four criteria remaining at the highly selective level, the percentage of college-bound seniors meeting the criteria increased from 5.9 percent to 8.5 percent. Similarly, if the cutpoint for the GPA is lowered from 3.5 to 3.0 (again with the other four criteria held constant at the selective level), the percentage of college-bound seniors meeting the new criteria was 8.3 percent.

Considered along with the lower requirements for GPA and SAT (i.e., 3.0 GPA and 950 SAT) scores, however, the reduction in number of credits required for any one of these three subjects (i.e., foreign language to less than two credits; English to three credits; and social studies to two credits) did not appreciably change the overall percentage of For example, 19.5 percent of college-bound students had three credits in mathematics and met the lowered requirements of three credits in English, two credits in social studies, and less than two credits in foreign language when combined with lower criteria for GPA (3.0) and SAT scores (950)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "It was surprising to find that only 5.9 percent of college-bound seniors met the highly selective criteria that included: (1) a high school GPA of 3.5 or higher; (2) a score of 1100 or higher on the SAT; 3a course-taking pattern that included four English credits, three mathematics credits, three science credits, three social studies credits, and two foreign language credits; (4) positive teacher comments regarding student; and (5) participation in two or 3 more school-related extracurricular activities. Even more surprising was the finding that after lowering the cutpoints on SAT scores (950), GPA (3.0), English credits (three), social studies (two), and foreign language credits (less than two), the percentage meeting the lower requirements only increased the proportion making the reduced cut to 19.5 percent. This means that approximately 80 percent of 1992 college-bound high school graduates did not meet the reduced criteria. Even for these students, though, there were many options available. Admissions criteria varied widely across all colleges, even among those popularly labeled \"highly selective,\" \"selective,\" and \"moderately selective,\" to say nothing of the differences generally between fouryear and two-year colleges. Nevertheless, these findings pointed to the fact that students need to begin preparing early, particularly if they plan to apply to highly competitive universities and colleges. Since a student's decision to take algebra, foreign language, or biological science in junior high school can affect course options and selections in high school, it is important for both the students and their parents to be aware of admission criteria at the colleges and universities where the student is likely to apply. The student sample used for this study included all graduating seniors who met the following criteria: (1) graduated by the summer of 1992; (2) transcripts were collected as part of the second follow-up data collection activities; (3) the transcript included records of courses taken in 9th, 10th, I 1 th, and 12th grades; (4) the transcript reported at least 16 credits; (5) the results of SAT or ACT tests were included on the transcript; and (6) the student indicated that he/she had applied to one or more postsecondary schools (variable F2S60A). Students who met these criteria are referred to in this report as college-bound. 2. For example, Barron's Profiles of American Colleges (copyright 1992 by Barron's Educational Series, Inc.) describes the \"Most Competitive\" group of colleges as those requiring incoming students to have grade averages of B+ to A and to be ranked in the top 10 -12 percent of their high school graduating class. The median freshman SAT scores at the \"Most Competitive\" colleges generally range from 1250 to 1600 (perfect score). 3. Alternatively, some students take the ACT, where a score of 24 is the equivalent for the 1100 SAT score used in this paper as an admission requirement. For this sample, a score of 1100 on SAT or 24 on the ACT are equivalent to the 70th percentile. The SAT/ACT crosswalk was developed using NELS:88 data. See appendix for detailed description. 4. These course-taking patterns represent an adaptation of the recommendation presented by the National Conunission on Excellence for collegebound students (A Nation at Risk -1983). The course-taking criteria used in this paper do not include the computer requirement (.5 credit). 5. Student self reports, school reports, teacher reports, and high school transcripts were used in this analysis. 6. Definitions for socio-economic status (SES) and other variables are included in the technical appendix. 7. When the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS) was considered separately, 71.7 6 percent of the college-bound seniors scored 1100 or higher on the SAT equivalent. 8. For this analysis, high ability college-bound students were defined as having a CPA of 3.5 and an SAT score equivalent of 1250. A score of 1250 on the SAT approximates the 88th percentile as compared to an SAT score of 1100 (used in previous analyses in this paper) which approximates the 70th percentile. The authors were interested in examining the course-taking patterns of high ability students (e.g., did the student take 4 credits in English and three credits in social studies?)."}, {"section_title": "APPENDIX: Technical Notes for NELS:88", "text": "The NELS:88 Baseline comprised a national probability sample of all regular public and private 8th grade schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia in the 1987-88 school year. During the base year data collection, students, parents, teachers, and school administrators were selected to participate in the survey. A total of 24,599 eighth grade students participated (93 percent response rate) in the base-year survey (see \"NELS:88 Base Year Sample Design Report, NCES 90-463). The NELS:88 first follow-up survey was conducted during the spring of 1990. Students, dropouts, teachers, and school administrators participated in the follow-up, with a successful data collection effort for 17,424 individuals in the student survey (approximately 93 percent response rate). Prior to data collection, the sample was freshened with tenth-grade students who did not have the opportunity (e.g., out of country) to be in the eighth-grade sample during the base-year (see NELS:88 First Follow-up Final Technical Report-NCES 94-632). During second follow-up data collection activities (1992), data were collected from students, dropouts, parents, teachers, school administrators, and extant high school transcripts. Again, as was done in the first follow-up, the sample was freshened. In addition, transcripts were collected from 13,173 respondents who had graduated by the fall of 1992.. For the analysis presented in this report, 6760 respondents were classified as collegebound with complete transcript data (used for this report), 244 were classified as college-bound with missing transcript data (not used in this report), "}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of the Sample used for this Report", "text": "The student sample used for this study included all graduating seniors who met the following criteria: (1) graduated by the summer of 1992; (2) transcripts were collected as part of the second follow-up data collection activities; (3) the transcript included records of courses taken in 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grades; (4) the transcript reported at least 16 credits; (5) the results of SAT or ACT tests were included on the transcript, and the student indicated that he/she had applied to one or more postsecondary schools (variable F2S60A).

It was hypothesized that high ability students may not be required to take four credits in English or 3 credits in social studies during their high school tenure. The high ability student may have had these requirements waived because of past performance or because he or she was a math or science concentrator. In the following table (table  3), the proportion of high ability (GPA of 3.5 or higher and SAT of 1250 or higher) students meeting the requirements for four English and three social studies credits are compared to lower ability college-bound students. There did appear to be some unfairness introduced by using criteria that required 3 or more credits in social studies or 4 credits in English, particularly in the case of other private schools where only 52.5 percent (78.4 percent for NAIS schools) of high ability students met the criteria for 3 social studies courses as compared to 91.0 percent for other private school students who did not meet the high ability criterion. It should also be pointed out that only 75.7 percent of higher ability NAIS students met the criteria of 4 English courses as compared to 86.7 percent for NAIS school students who did not meet the higher ability criteria.

In comparing college-bound students who were included in the study (column 5) vs. all collegebound students (column 2), table 4 indicates that there does not seem to be any systematic bias, in that the proportion of the subgroups were similar for both groups (see columns 2 and 5) by race/ethnicity, by SES, and by school type. College Bound -Includes following two groups. Complete cases -Students classified into this category had graduated by 1992 and participated in the transcript study. In addition, the transcript included complete SAT/ACT scores, course-work at 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grades, and at least 16 total credits. The student also indicated via variable F2S60A that he/she had applied to one or more postsecondary schools. Not complete cases -Two criteria needed to be satisfied for a student to be classified as missing.

The complex sample design was taken into account when a Taylor series approximation procedure was used to compute the standard errors in this report. The standard error is a measure of the variability of a sample estimate due to sampling. It indicates, for a given sample size, how much variance there is in the population of possible estimates of a parameter. If all possible samples were selected under similar conditions, intervals of 1.96 standard errors below to 1.96 standard errors above a particular statistic would include the true population parameter being estimated for about 95 percent of these samples (i.e., 95 percent confidence interval). Comparisons noted in this report are significant at the 0.05 level and were determined using Bonferroni adjusted t-tests. Standard errors for all of the estimates are presented in Tables 1 and 2. These standard errors can be used to produce confidence intervals. For example, an estimated 19.2 percent of college-bound high school graduates had a GPA of 3.5 or higher (see Table 1). This figure has an estimated standard error of 0.924 percent.

The denominator was the sum of standard course credits. The grade factor was (2) SAT Equivalent Score An SAT composite score was calculated by summing the SAT math and verbal test scores as reported on student transcripts. If any one of these two scores was missing, the composite score was set to missing. If the SAT composite was missing or not reported on a transcript, the ACT composite test score (again from transcript) was used to create an equivalent SAT composite score. In creating an equivalent SAT composite test score, weighted percentiles were created using the college bound (complete) subsample for SAT and ACT composite scores found on the NELS:88 transcript file. ACT test scores were examined, by comparing the weighted percentiles for SAT test scores of 950, 1100, and 1250 (cutoffs used in analyses reported in this paper). These percentiles were found to be 44 percent, 70 percent, and 88 percent respectively, which equate to ACT test scores of 21, 24, and 28. In examining these three ACT test scores, though, it was found that an ACT score of 21 corresponded to weighted percentiles of 41 percent to 48 percent; an ACT score of 24 corresponded to weighted percentiles of 65 percent to 70 percent; and an ACT score of 28 corresponded to weighted percentiles of 87 percent to 91 percent. In an attempt to improve this possible discrepancy in the crosswalk between ACT and SAT scores, the following steps were taken: 62.5 percent (5 out of each 8) of ACT scores of 21 were randomly assigned an SAT950 score of I with the remaining students in this category receiving a 0. 16.6 (1 out of each 6) of ACT scores of 24 were randomly assigned an SAT 1100 score of 1 with the remaining students in this category receiving a0. 80 percent (4 out or each 5) of ACT scores of 28 were randomly assigned an SAT1250 score of 1 with the remaining students in this category receiving a 0.
