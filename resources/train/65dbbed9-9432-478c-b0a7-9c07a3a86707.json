[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Once scientists earn a terminal degree in their field (usually a PhD), one objective may be to find a career within their field of study commensurate with their extensive and intensive academic training obtained within that field. This assumption is not only held by individuals, but by educational and occupational institutions. The United States, for instance, produces approximately 20,000 science doctorates annually, second only to China (Cyranoski et al. 2011). Although the supply of doctorates has increased over the past few decades, the demand for PhDs in traditional academic jobs has decreased. In 1973, for instance, 55% of doctorates in the biological sciences secured tenure-track positions and 2% worked in untenured track positions within 6 years after completion of their degrees. A little over 30 years later, only 15% of doctorates in the biological sciences secured tenure-track positions and 18% received untenured academic positions within 6 years of graduation (Cyranoski et al. 2011). Consequently, an increasing number of PhD recipients have had to look outside of their field of study for a well-paying job. These increasing job/education mismatches have created significant repercussions, including but not limited to, consequences for wages, job satisfaction and mobility (Bender and Heywood 2011). The supply and demand of PhDs has been steadily at odds over the past few decades within the academic realm, but this trend does not fully portray field matches in business or government jobs. Nor does it explain who among this educational elite is more likely to end up in a field outside their doctoral field of study. Extant research indicates that job placement is strongly influenced not only by merit and pedigree but also by membership in specific demographic groups (Ma 2011). For instance, significant gender differences exist in occupational outcomes even for individuals with similar degrees and training (Mann and DiPrete 2013). Consequently, gender segregation is widespread across fields, disciplines and levels of education (Acker 1990a), even though it causes at the highest levels of expertise have not yet been examined (Frehill, Abreu, and Zippel 2015). Much existing research places doctoral job-education mismatches as predictors of other events, as job/field mismatches have consequences for wages, job satisfaction and mobility (Bender and Heywood 2011). In contrast, few studies have examined institutional or individual-level factors associated with a PhD scientist holding a job outside of the field of their PhD. Using data from the 2015 Survey of Doctorate Recipients (National Science Foundation, 2019), this thesis will examine how demographic characteristics, human capital and social capital explain PhD credential/job matche. These factors could contribute to the stratification of specific populations into PhD credential mismatches. This stratification is associated with an individual's lack of occupational opportunities (including job satisfaction, autonomy and higher wages), while whole fields lose intellectual human capital, creativity and growth."}, {"section_title": "LITERATURE REVIEW", "text": "Studies of individuals whose educational credentials do not match their occupation primarily focus on the outcomes of credential mismatches. Credential mismatches can negatively affect individual wages and limit on-the-job searches (Allen and van der Velden 2001), can increase job turnover (Hersch 1991), and even influence job satisfaction (Tsang and Levin 1985). We know far less about what type of individuals face credential-job match and mismatches. On one hand, perhaps women or minorities, who are tracked into specific fields (Riegle-Crumb et al. 2012) are more likely to face credential-job mismatches, due to their limited career options (England and Li 2006:200). On the other hand, perhaps it is advantageous for other, privileged individuals, such as white males, to find a job outside of their doctoral field of study and the mere possession of a PhD could elevate these individuals into more lucrative fields. The PhD track is particularly interesting, as the educational goal of PhD students is to narrow their field of study and accumulate knowledge within that specific category (Jones 2018). Collegiate tracks at lower levels of educational attainment can include both specific and general scholarship, and a liberal arts education can lead to a variety of jobs and careers (Robst 2007). By focusing on the PhD level of educational credentials, we can assess what differential credential-job match patterns emerge at the highest level of education. This raises the question: Under which conditions are PhD holders, specifically STEM PhD earners, are likely to hold jobs outside their PhD field of study? It is important to understand the factors promoting or impeding a credential-job match for PhD holders. By assessing predictors of having a job that matches a scientist's field of study, including demographics and human and social capital factors, we can understand the potentially stratified pathways that can develop at elite educational levels."}, {"section_title": "Conceptual Framework", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Using Sociology to Respond to an Economic Theory", "text": "Human Capital Theory is a rational choice theory used explain the distribution of workers within the labor market (Nafukho, Hairston, and Brooks 2004). The theory has undergone many iterations (Fitz-enz 2000;Schultz 1961), but the underlying outcome remains the same: a person's education and training denotes their productivity, and therefore value, as a working member of the labor market. To summarize, Human Capital Theory posits that the skills and qualities of individuals determine their job placement and wages. Researchers still use Human Capital Theory (HCT) and related classic supply and demand arguments to explain PhD credential match or mismatches. A recent analysis of almost 6,000 humanities PhDs, for example, uses this line of argument to explain mismatches for degree holders in fields that outstrip the number of jobs available. (Jaschik 2017). The HCT model assumes both laborers and employers are rational actors, constantly engaging in a cost-benefit analysis (Doppelt 2019). This model also assumes that the educational credentials an individual earns will be enough to find a job that matches those credentials and that there should be no systematic differences between groups in who ends up getting matchedonly personal preferences of job seekers and labor market constraints, rather than prejudice or exclusion. Human Capital has received criticism across disciplines (Bozeman, S. Dietz, and Gaughan 2001;Corley et al. 2019) for its narrow definition. Sociologists have critiqued HCT for a long time because the model fails to acknowledge other forms of capital, such as social capital, or cultural context. In response to this critique, some social scientists have indeed expanded the definition of Human Capital Theory to include more forms of capital. The Scientific and Technical Human Capital Model (STHC), for instance, includes social capital with the traditional HCT model (Bozeman et al. 2001). Although this model is conceptually more sound, others point out that it also fails to account for social context, context that is grounded in cultural and organizational practices and institutional dynamics to explain job market outcomes (Corley et al. 2019). These alternative drivers (social context) have been coalesced into the concept of \"inequality regimes\" (coined by Joan Acker) (Acker 2006). This implications of demographic characteristics (such as gender and race) are socially constructed (Risman 2004) and are subject to hidden inequality regimes that systematically stratify individuals into different occupational choices. Similar to Bozeman and Corley, I expand on HCT to incorporate not only human capital, but also social capital and social context (measured by demographic characteristics).  "}, {"section_title": "Which Factors Influence Finding a PhD Job-", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Demographic Characteristics", "text": "Demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, marital status, citizenship and the presence of children can provide more or fewer opportunities and choices based upon the social value or meaning of each characteristics. Women, for example, face systematic obstacles in finding the right educational job type and fit. Persistent gender stratification leads to systemic discrimination in hiring and promotion, and women's exclusion from high-status occupations or positions is more likely (Jaschik 2017). Once on the job, women in workplaces or occupations dominated by men typically face greater risks of PhD Job-Credential Match marginalization, tokenism, and \"glass ceilings\" (Bird and Rhoton 2011;Fitzsimons 2017; Irvine and Vermilya 2010). Men, on the other hand, are systematically offered more opportunities. Studies show that men in occupations dominated by women quickly move into separate, often higher status, tracks (e.g., promotion into administration, management), and are actively \"doing gender\" in ways that facilitate boundary-building between their own work and that of their women colleagues (Budig 2002;Williams 1995). This shows how men are systematically given higher human capital and tracked into certain institutions, though this tracking is not necessarily an accurate representation of skills and abilities. At the PhD level, individuals can spend between 5 and 10 years earning their PhD (Zhou and Okahana 2019). If a PhD recipient is unable to find a job due to socially stratified systems (e.g. inequality regimes) surrounding one's socially constructed demographics (e.g. race, gender), then the time and resources the PhD recipient invests in earning their degree is vexing and whole fields will lose intellectual capital. Marital status and the presence of children are two additional key demographic characteristics that could influence job options. One study found that in a sample of dualincome heterosexual couples, wives are less likely than their husbands to relocate for a better job if their husband will suffer a decrease in income (Bielby and Bielby 1992). For women in dual-earner families and who have children, there continues to be asymmetry of gender roles. Mothers average 13 more hours of housework and 6 more hours of childcare than fathers (Bianchi, Robinson, and Milkie 2007). This second shift women experience in childcare will not only impact the jobs available to them, but also the type of job women (i.e. flexible hours) seek. In one study of college graduates on the east coast, men had a 52-mile larger job search radius than women (Kolmar, 2018). Another salient demographic characteristic that could be associated with a PhD credential-job match is citizenship status. Often, international students come to the United States for a specific educational goal and are recruited into high-skilled jobs upon degree completion (Redden 2018). Although international students studying in the US are currently declining in number (Redden 2018), the act of moving to a new country to study and work in a specific field would presumably increase the potential for a PhD credential match. In light of the extant empirical research discussed above, I formulate the following hypotheses."}, {"section_title": "Hypotheses", "text": "H1a: I hypothesize that men scientists will have a greater likelihood of a job credential match than women scientists. H1b: I hypothesize that scientists who are married will be less likely to have a match than scientists who are not married, as a partner and their partner's career could limit an individual's job options. H1c: I hypothesize that scientists who live with children will be less likely to have a match than those who do not live with children. H1d: Similar to H1a, I hypothesize that minorities will be less likely to have a job credential match than non-minorities, as they are subject to similar social constraints as women. H1e: I predict older scientists will be more likely to have a job credential match than younger scientists, as they will have accrued more human and social capital and will have more leverage in finding a job with the right fit.

In this thesis, human capital is measured in terms of the degree field (e.g. the broad and specialty field of bachelor and doctorate field of study) and number of hours worked per week (as a proxy for \"commitment\" to the job). Because of differential supply and demand for positions across STEM PhD fields of study (Landivar 2013), I anticipate that there will be differences in whether an individual has a job that matches their PhD level degree field. In particular, because there are more jobs in the areas of computer and mathematical science and engineering in the science and engineering workforce (National Science Board 2018), I anticipate that recipients of doctoral degrees in these areas will be the most likely to have a job in-field. Given that a doctorate degree is sought to obtain in-depth knowledge in a topic (Bowen and Rudenstine 2014) and is more proximal in time to the current job because it is obtained after a bachelor's degree, I anticipate that the doctorate field of study will be a stronger predictor of having a job-credential match than the bachelor's degree field. Because I am using the number of hours per week as a proxy for commitment, I anticipate that those who show the most \"commitment\" (work more hours per week) will be more likely to have a degree field-job match.\nField of First Doctorate The field of first doctorate will be highly associated with a jobcredential match."}, {"section_title": "Social Capital", "text": "Social capital is another form of capital that plays a role in securing a job (Bozeman et al. 2001;Corley et al. 2019). As such, I include measures of social capital (e.g. network associations through professional memberships and conference attendance) to more thoroughly pinpoint the specific mechanisms that are associated with credential matches. This will also help to disentangle human capital from social capital. Occupational networks are often demographically homogeneous (Ma 2011;Yoder 2017) but networking can help circumvent this homogeneity. In attending conferences and becoming members of professional groups, PhD-level professionals develop social capital and improve their job market standingand potentially have a better opportunity for a credential match. Social capital is particularly advantageous for people seeking careers (Adler and Kwon 2002;de Janasz and Forret 2008). By networking within a field, an individual will gain access to network knowledge, resources, and mentorship, which is directly related to salary, promotions and career satisfaction (Seibert, Kraimer, and Liden 2001). Granovetter found that personal contacts as a source of network knowledge were related to higher income (Granovetter 2018). The association could also work in the other direction. Perhaps people with a degree-field match will be more professionally engaged and thus more likely to attend conferences and take part in professional memberships.\nAttended Conferences in the Past Year If a respondent attended a conference within the past year, they are more likely to have a jobcredential match."}, {"section_title": "Controlling for Institutional Context", "text": "Institutional level structures in higher education shape the lives of individuals and their social interactions that then lead to occupational inequalities (Acker 2006). Previous research has shown that institutional level factors can influence gender differences in undergraduate student outcomes (DeAngelo 2011, Carnegie Foundation 2018). For example, the undergraduate gender gap between male and female GPA is greater at non-Research I institutions than at non-Research I institutions (Bender and Heywood 2011;Yoder 2017). Similarly, undergraduate students attending colleges that spend more on research expenditures and comparatively less on the educational experience of the student body are less likely to persist in STEM majors (Griffith 2010). Because educational institutions are a direct pathway into jobs, the type of institution at both the collegiate and doctoral level could make a difference in a credential match. Due to the importance of institutional context, this thesis will incorporate institutional variables (e.g. the Carnegie classification of the scientists' bachelor and doctoral institutions) as control variables. Much of the current research on credential-job matches relies more heavily on job duties and tasks over field of study. While the data used for this analysis does not provide specific occupational codes (or job tasks), it provides invaluable information regarding broad occupational categories. Specifically, the data identify classic research/academic jobs as separate from managerial roles and teaching roles. Because this data will allow for an exploration of job field and specific job tasks, I'll take advantage of this measure and explore how each of my independent variables (demographic characteristics, human and social capital) are associated with having non-field specific managerial and teaching roles versus S&E jobs in-field and other non-S&E jobs."}, {"section_title": "DATA AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Source and Sample", "text": "The Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) is a biennial survey conducted by the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) within the National Science Foundation for individuals who hold a doctorate degree in a broad range of STEM fields. These STEM fields also include health-related sciences and are often referred to as \"Science, Engineering or Health: (SEH) fields. This survey asks about The Survey of Doctorate Recipients collects its data through a trimodal approach: a self-administered questionnaire sent in the mail, a self-administered online survey and a computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI). In the 2015 SDR, the weighted response rate was 66%, while the unweighted response rate was 68%. The SDR includes sampling weights for each survey respondent in order to create unbiased population estimates and account for nonresponse bias. The analysis weights used in the data account for differential sampling rates, adjustments for unknown eligibility, adjustments for nonresponse and adjustments to align with the Doctorate Records File (DRF) distribution on gender, race and ethnicity, degree year and degree field. The SDR data included both logical imputation and statistical (hot deck) imputation in its data processing. A hot deck imputation method was utilized for item nonresponse.

This variable takes the value of 1 where the specialty field of study for the PhD and the fine field for the respondents' principal job match (e.g., both the job and the PhD. are in Computer and Information Sciences) and a value of 0 where the specialty field of study for the PhD and the specialty field for the respondent's principal job do not match (e.g., the job is in Chemical Engineering and the PhD is in Electrical or Computer Hardware Engineering). Overall, 55.77% of the respondents have a job that matches their specialty field of study for the PhD 57.36% of women and 55.05% of men have a job that matches their specialty field of PhD study. These specialty field categories help pinpoint specific (mis)match dynamics that remain invisible when we only examine broad field of study. By looking closer at the specialty field of study, I parse out the teaching and management jobs that cannot easily be matched with the many specialty fields of study (Appendix A). In particular, the specialty field for the principal job include all persons whose primary job is \"teaching\" or \"administration\" in the postsecondary teaching and manager categories. Thus, even if those individuals identify themselves as scientists who are working in their field, their principal job fails to categorize them accordingly (e.g., a university College Dean who continues to do research in their field of study would be classified as an administrator and thus working out-of-field according to the specialty field of study). This leads to the creation of a four category dependent variable which takes the value of 0 for being a known specialty field mismatch, 1 for known specialty field match, 3 for a job as a teacher with no clear field designation, and 4 for a job as a manager/administrator with no clear field designation. Overall, 27.03% of employed PhD scientists are in a field with a known mismatch between the specialty field of job and the field for the PhD, 55.25% have a known match between the specialty field of job and the field for the PhD, 14.30% are employed as teachers with an unknown field of employment, and 3.42% are employed as managers with an unknown field for the job. Among women, 25.84% of them have a known mismatch between specialty field of study and specialty field of job, 56.42% of women have a specialty field match, 4.91% of women are teachers and 12.83% of women are managers. The breakdown for men is that 27.58% are in a specialty field mismatch, 54.71% are in a specialty field match, 2.73% are teachers and 14.97% of men are managers."}, {"section_title": "Independent Variables", "text": "Sixteen independent variables are used in this analysis, grouped under the following three categories: a) demographics, b) social and human capital, and c) control variables.

I use survey-design adjusted multinomial regression models to assess the association between demographic characteristics and the possession of human and social capital with being either a manager in a non-specific field or a teacher in a non-specific field. I estimate one full model to include the independent variables. Table 1 shows the distribution of the variables of interest for the full sample and separately for men and women. Approximately 40% of men and women find jobs outside of their principal doctorate field of study, with no meaningful difference between men and women.

Table 3 represents the distribution of respondents who are in specialty field matching, specialty Lastly, I looked at the control variables. Academic scientists are the most likely to have a job in the field of their doctorate degree compared to those working in the government or business sectors. Of note, scientists who enter the business sector have a much higher likelihood of entering a managerial position (21.64%) than those who work for the government (16.75%) and those who work in academia (7.01%). And only those scientists who work in academia will enter post-secondary teaching positions (7.24%).

Model 3 shows full model results for all study variables."}, {"section_title": "Demographics", "text": "Model 1 shows the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the demographic predictor variables examining the probability of whether a PhD level scientist holds a job in their same field as their broad or specialty field for their doctoral degree or not. When we look at the outcome of a job being in the same broad field as the PhD, there is no discernible difference between men and women. However, there are gender differences in job specialization within specialty field, consistent with my first hypothesis. The odds of having a job that matches the specialty field of study increases slightly for women (5%) as compared to men, holding all demographic variables constant (OR=1.056, p<.05). However, this gender discrepancy reverses and grows slightly in magnitude as additional variables are added to the models. In this model, the proxies for tangible and intangible human capital are significantly associated with the outcome variable. Respondents who attended one or more professional conferences within the past year had 17% higher odds of having a degree/field match than their colleagues who did not attend conferences (F(26.79, p<.0001)). Similarly, respondents who possessed memberships in even just one professional association had a significantly higher likelihood of having a job/field match than those were not part of professional associations (F(45.48, p<.0001)). The odds of having a job/degree match decreases by 10% for respondents who works full time as compared to half (OR=.895, p<.05), although this association is modest and explained by the control variables.\nGender is a strong predictor of job specialization. The relative risk ratio of going into the teaching field rather than finding a credential match is 33.3% higher for women scientists than for men scientists (RRR=1.333, p<.0001). Interestingly, the relative risk ratio of entering a managerial field rather than finding a credential match is 12.1% higher for women scientists than for men scientists (RRR=1.121 p<.05) and of having a more general S&E field mismatch is 9.3% higher for women scientists than for men scientists.  Perhaps the most surprising finding is that approximately 40-45% of respondents find a job outside of their broad doctorate field of study. After 5 to 10 years of investment in time, money and personal sacrifice, this finding is consequential. Below I summarize which type of scientists are more likely to switch their fields of doctoral study and account for this large majority. Note that my conceptual model presented above posits that the accumulations of certain experiences, such as going to conferences or being a part of professional memberships, is directionally associated with finding a job credential match. This causal model may in fact run the other direction. Scientists who are in fields who match their field of PhD are perhaps more likely to select into a professional membership, attend conferences or seek certain positions. The associations I find within this thesis should be considered as a two-way correlation and not merely a one-way causal model. Although women were significantly less likely to secure a job-credential match than men, confirming my first hypothesis, the bivariate results and the multinomial results show unique differences across men and women scientists. Women scientists with PhDs were more likely to not be married, were more likely to be a minority and more likely to be native U.S. citizens than men scientists. There were significant differences in the fields that men and women entered, both at the doctoral level and the bachelor's level. We may expect women who are in certain fields to be more likely to leave because of the \"chilly climate\" they may encounter in certain STEM due to their gender identity (Britton 2017), but future research should explore the specific correlates that may differ for men and women and to establish a baseline. Women scientists were more likely than men scientists to attend a conference in the past year, and more likely to work part-time than full-time. Women scientists were significantly more likely to enter academia and significantly less likely to enter the business sector. Their salaries reflect this, as there was a wage gap between men and women scientists. In the more detailed analyses of both job-credential match and job type, women scientists were more likely than men scientists to secure post-secondary teaching position rather than managerial positions. Although the gender findings were unexpected, these findings were superseded by other demographic factors, most of which differed from my hypotheses, summarized in Figure 2. Although women scientists were slightly less likely to find a job credential match than men scientists as per my first hypothesis, marital status, the presence of  Table   Summary Table  Variable Hypothesis (Likelihood of a Job-Credential Match)"}, {"section_title": "Controls", "text": "The control variables added provided additional context to Model 3. There is no difference in having a job that matches one's field for those who receive their bachelor's or doctorate degree from a public or private institution, although those whose doctorate institution type was not available (possibly because of being from a foreign institution) were much more likely to have a job that matched their field. The type of job a respondent currently holds (i.e. academic, government or business) was significantly associated with a job/field match (F(513.74, p<.0001)). Holding a government job decreased the odds of a scientist having a job/degree field match by 48% (OR=.525, p<.0001) relative to being in an academic job.

In addition, my analyses show that job outcomes are not just reflective of individual-level attributes. Employment sector had a significant association with being a job that matched the PhD field of study. Those in government jobs and in the business sector were significantly less likely to have a job in their field of study. This makes sense, as the comparison group is academia, and many scientists will choose to stay or are confined in their field of study, as the job categories outside of academia are less well defined. Salary had a nonlinear association, as those in the second quartile are more likely to find a job credential match and those in the top quartile are less likely to find a job credential match. I suspect salary is highly correlated with job type, and this current association may reflect multicollinearity issues among the independent variables."}, {"section_title": "Hours Per Week Typically Worked", "text": "The more hours an individual works per week, the greater likelihood of a job-credential match."}, {"section_title": "Number of Professional Memberships", "text": "The higher the number of professional memberships, the more likely a job-credential match."}, {"section_title": "Teachers and Managers", "text": "Due to the limitations of operationalizing job/field matches, I parse out job type from job field among those without a credential match, and denote which scientists are more likely to be non-field-specific teachers or managers. Women scientists are more likely to be teachers than men scientists and men scientists are more likely than women scientists to be managers. The older a scientist is, the more likely they are to be in a manager position. According to human capital theory, not only does the degree matter but also the field of study matters for job outcomes. The only field of doctoral study relative to Computer and Mathematical Sciences that increases the risk of becoming both a teacher and a manger is the Social and Related Sciences field. I presume that this is because this field teaches less technical skills and more comprehensive skills than the other fields, skills that would easily translate to a teaching or managerial position, as both require complex problem solving and people skills. Those who earn a doctorate in the Physical and Related Sciences are more likely to be managers and less likely to be teachers, but those scientists who earn their bachelor's in the Physical and Related Sciences are more likely to secure teaching positions. This discrepancy should be studied in further research"}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "This research is not without limitations. One limitation of the analysis is that I had to drop 4% of respondents from the sample -those who earned their doctorate in the illdefined category of \"Science and Engineering Related Fields\". Those respondents did not have a way to clearly identify whether the job was in-field compared to other STEM fields. I instead focused on fields that were clearly defined to more clearly define the dependent variable, but these related fields are omitted from the analysis. Another limitation is that these analyses are based on cross-sectional data, meaning the findings cannot be interpreted as the result of causal dynamics, but should instead be viewed as evidence of correlation. For example, managers have higher salaries than teachers, but possessing a high salary does not cause someone to be a manager. Similarly, government and business jobs do not employ teachers, and so that comparison is limited. Although findings suggest only modest gender differences overall, that does not mean there are not gender differences that have not been explored. Based on current research about gender differences in STEM and in the work force (Acker 2006;Britton 2017), gender differences may also exist across the contextual variables. Due to the saliency of inequality regimes (Acker 1990b), it is possible that for men and women with jobs who have received a PhD degree within certain fields, men could face less resistance in securing a PhD credential match than women. Future analyses could use these findings and utilize gender as a modifying variable to explore whether the relationship of human and social capital characteristics varies for men and women on PhD job matches. Future research should also include an analysis of gender discrepancies between different PhD STEM fields in particular. Since the PhD STEM education system is already stratified (Fox and Stephan 2001) and there is a selection bias inherent in this sample, perhaps only solely looking at the PhD level (where women have already overcome many obstacles), is too narrow a focus. Future research should systematically explore gender as a modifying effect. Along those same lines, my analyses were limited in exploring intersectional characteristics. For example, looking at women of color is difficult within these analyses because there are few women and fewer minorities in the. The racial distinctions within this data set is white/non-white, due to the constraints of the data and the small subset of scientists of color. Most of the non-whites are categorized as Asian non-Hispanic. This makes it exceedingly challenging to make clear inferences about intersectionality on a broad scale. Future research should investigate intersectional characteristics, such as gender and race, within the PhD realm. Another limitation is the multicollinearity between the bachelor's degrees and doctoral fields of study. Furthermore, a subset of individuals in my study did not have any information on their bachelor's degrees. This could be explained by measurement error, but it could also mean some scientists skip earning their bachelor's degree and go directly into their master's or doctoral training. It could also mean that a scientist coming from another country has access to a different school-to-job pipeline. Future research should examine this phenomenon, as it could provide clues to why scientists leave their field of study, and to more thoroughly understand the mechanisms around the school to job pipeline."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion and Future Implications", "text": "My findings indicate support for the argument that job-credential matches are associated with both demographic characteristics, as well as social and human capital factors. Most noteworthy, 40-45% of scientists leave their field of doctoral study. My models account for who switches, but I can only speculate as to why they switch. It is unclear if this mass exodus is problematic or advantageous. Being an older scientist, for example, is positively associated with holding a job outside of a field of study. This particular phenomenon could be explained by the accumulation of social and human capitalolder scientists accrue social and human capital as they age, which perhaps gives them more job opportunities. Older scientists are also more likely to be in managerial positions, which may or may not be field specific. A job-credential mismatch in the case of older scientists could merely mean more opportunity, job mobility and access to a higher salary. A job mismatch could indicate a move to a higher salaried job, a job with higher satisfaction or to an interdisciplinary position. On the other hand, for scientists who are less likely to switch fields, such as non-U.S. citizens, is a match actually disadvantageous? On the surface, the school-to-job pipeline is working for non-U.S. citizens (in line with Human Capital Theory). Non-U.S. citizens are less likely to switch their fields of study. Women are also more likely to find a job credential match. But higher salaries are associated with job credential mismatches, not matches. Jobs in the business sector are the highest paying industries and business sector jobs seem to be field specific. Perhaps we are seeing evidence of naturally occurring inequality regimes hidden in plain sight, as men are more likely than women to have a job mismatch, and more men than women are employed in the business sector. Even though certain groups of people are more likely to accrue a match, perhaps that match is less economically advantageous to them than a mismatch, as their opportunities for higher paying business jobs are limited. If certain demographic groups are systematically being limited from job mismatches, this would provide more evidence against Human Capital Theory and support the idea of inequality regimes. More research is needed to understand whether the problem lies within the pipeline of the doctoral field, or whether the match/mismatch is a product of mobility. Research should also explore if matching education credentials to an occupational field is always best. Although this particular dataset is not optimally suited to fully examine how institutional context counters HCT (since the institutional context were rough measures of institutional control, rather than prestige in a discipline or other institutional factors), more research should explore how institutional context plays a role in the school-to-labor force pipeline. Further, next steps should also look within this phenomenon and test gender interaction effects. In this way, future research can more fully explore inequality regimes at the institutional and individual levels. A changing academic job market may also be changing the implications of a jobfield mismatch. We assume a PhD recipient is a faculty member, but this is not the case with the changing academic context. As baby boomers exit their tenure-track academic positions at a slower pace, there are fewer jobs available for PhDs. The dwindling demand could mean academics receive less institutionalized support, which would propel PhD recipients to explore occupational opportunities outside of academia. Indeed, as this analysis shows, PhDs are employed in a wide range of sectors. The pipeline from a PhD to an academic position looks very different from the pipeline from a PhD to the business sector. Future research should compare and contrast the multiple occupational pipelines between sectors. If so many PhD recipients are leaving their field of study, what does this mean about the training of the U.S. labor force? Should more fields be interdisciplinary? Are certain fields providing more transferable skills than other fields, which gives them an advantage in the labor force? As more PhD recipients enter the business or government sectors, it would behoove doctoral granting institutions to assess their training and track their graduates through time. As academic jobs dwindle, it is important for institutions of higher learning to assess the market to better set their students up for occupational success. It would be useful for schools and students alike to understand how and when certain fields have specific prestige or are in high demand within the economic zeitgeist. Currently, the supply is mismatching demand. In either case, as many PhD scientists are leaving their field of study, future research should examine both the individual and contextual reasons as to why so many find themselves on separate field pathways."}]
