Since the institutionalization of the field during the last century, the number of communication PhDs has risen steadily; today more than 500 PhDs in communication are awarded nationally each year (Thurgood, Golladay, & Hill, 2006). Representing a wide range of research interests, from rhetoric to media studies and interpersonal communication, communication PhDs pursue a variety of career paths. But what distinguishes these career paths? Who ends up in tenure-track posts? Who banks the largest salaries? Are different career paths associated with specific graduate school experiences or mentorship? Have communication PhDs pursued high-prestige jobs at the expense of quality personal lives? Using data from a national survey of social science PhDs, Social Science PhDs-Five+ Years Out, this report attempts to answer these questions and more about the career trajectories of communication PhDs. It covers experiences in graduate school, productivity, and personal tradeoffs during the early career. The survey results should be of interest to college administrators, graduate programs, graduate students, and students contemplating pursuing graduate education. This study adopts a \"student centered\" approach to evaluating the PhD experience. As opposed to \"faculty centered\" measures, such as publication productivity and scholarly reputation of graduate faculty, \"student centered\" indicators include measures of program quality such as experiences with mentoring, advising, and job placement (Denecke, 2006, xixiii;Nerad, Aanerud, & Cerny, 2004;Ostriker & Kuh, 2003). In short, this survey empowers communication PhDs to evaluate their own experience by doing something they presumably do best: communicate. Social Science PhDs -Five+ Years Out (SS5) collected data from a national sample of PhDs in six disciplines (anthropology, communication, geography, history, political science, and sociology), who completed their degrees in the United States between July 1, 1995 and June 30, 1999. The survey was conducted by the Center Communicating the PhD Experience for Innovation and Research in Graduate Education (CIRGE) at the University of Washington in Seattle, and funded by the Ford Foundation. The general outlook for communications PhDs is good. Most communication PhDs want ladder faculty positions and most find them. In fact, communication PhDs find faculty positions more readily than doctorate holders in other social science fields. In general respondents felt well prepared for their careers, although they indicated the need for improvements in PhD education, particularly in teaching training, grant writing and mentoring. Differences in academic productivity and assessments of graduate school experiences emerged between those currently working in business, government or non-profit jobs and ladder faculty. Men and women expressed different attitudes about balancing work and family life after graduation; with women more concerned about the effects of their job on family. Nevertheless, despite these intriguing differences, the majority of communication graduates surveyed were satisfied with their jobs and the path they traveled to get them."}, {"section_title": "Communicating the PhD Experience", "text": "\n\nKey Finding #9 Skills in grant writing and management are often important in faculty positions and even more likely to be important in nonfaculty jobs, however, fewer than 5% of respondents felt their PhD programs trained them well in writing proposals for funding and managing people and budgets."}, {"section_title": "Survey Methods and Limitations", "text": "More than 6000 individuals who earned their PhD between July 1, 1995 and June 30, 1999 were asked to complete the SS5 online survey in 2005 -2006 on their post-PhD career paths and graduate school experiences. Respondents were recruited from 65 U.S. institutions sampled to represent geographic diversity and public and private institutions. For each discipline except communication, equal numbers of departments from each quartile of the 1995 National Research Council (NRC) rankings of each graduate program were represented (Goldberger, Maher, & Flattau, 1995). Since the NRC does not rank communication programs, communication programs were chosen based on their size, diversity of student populations, recommendations by the National Communication Association (NCA) and whether or not the institutions had other disciplines included in the SS5 sample. Ultimately over 3000 respondents, 346 in communication, completed the survey. The overall response rate for the study was 45%, for communication it was 46%.

The non-response analysis found that women, whites, U.S. citizens (including permanent residents) and unmarried individuals responded at higher rates than men, non-whites, citizens of other countries, and married people. The differences between respondents and nonrespondents were small. A difference that readers should keep in mind when interpreting findings appeared in post-graduation plans. Respondents were more likely to report to the SED definite post-graduation plans to work in the academic sector. This over-representation probably results from it being easier to locate people working in the academic sector than in other sectors. Implications of this for the study include underestimating the size of the non-academic labor market for communication PhDs.

The SS5 survey included quantitative questions concerning employment history, relationship events and parenting, graduate school achievements, the quality of the PhD program, mentoring by the dissertation advisor, and the usefulness of their doctoral education. Open-ended questions asked about trade-offs between work and family life, experiences with mentoring, advice to beginning graduate students, advice to graduate programs, experiences with diversity, and experiences related to gender, racial/ethnic, class or other personal identities.

While some communication scholars trace their lineage to the ancient practices of rhetoric and public speaking, others see communication as a 20th century discipline, forged from psychology and sociology, yet distinguished by a focus on mass media messages and technologies (Delia, 1987). Communication straddles a humanities -social science nexus, and the organizational structure of communication programs varies widely between academic institutions. Some communication programs differentiate between speech and mass communication, some do not, and many include journalism programs under a single \"Communication\" administrative/organizational structure (Gronbeck, 2005). The diversity of communication programs and the lack of an agreement over a common history complicate quantitatively operationalizing \"communication\" programs. This study used the list of communication subfields defined in the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED): These categories were collapsed for analytical purposes, and the number of respondents in each collapsed subfield is listed in Table 2 Finally, the discipline has steadily attracted more graduate students since 1920 when the NSF began tracking communication PhDs.

Communicating the PhD Experience reports and presenting were not \"very important\" for them than were those in faculty positions. Recalling that people in BGN sectors published less and attended fewer conferences during graduate school, this comparative lack of academic productivity seems to have marginal significance in their current jobs. Conversely, individuals in BGN and academic non-faculty posts were more likely to report that working with diverse groups and collaborating with a team were \"very important\" in their current work. Finally, Table 10 shows the overall lack of preparation reported in grant writing and managing people and budgets. These skills are likely to be at least somewhat important in academic jobs and to be \"very important\" in BGN sector jobs, but fewer than 5% of all respondents felt well trained in writing proposals for funding and managing people and budgets.

While most communication graduates seemed to follow a neatly linear path from graduate school to desired ladder faculty positions with general career satisfaction, significant and interesting cleavages were revealed in the data when analyzed by gender and job type, with particularly salient differences between those working in BGN sectors and academic faculty. To recap, there were few differences between ladder faculty and non-tenure-track faculty in terms of productivity, skill acquisition and mentoring experiences in graduate school, but there were some notable differences between those in academia and those in BGN sectors. Individuals in BGN were generally less productive in terms of papers and presentations, despite a longer sojourn in graduate school. While we cannot say if people went into BGN because they were less productive, had different socialization experiences, or because they intended to do so all along, individuals in BGN were less likely than faculty to report that publishing skills were important in their jobs. Second, career paths of men and women in terms of job type and income were the same, but gender differences emerged in assessments of personal opportunity costs. Women were more likely to delay marriage and postpone or not have children because of their career. However, respondents who did have active family lives did not necessarily see having a family as detrimental to their career. Instead, they viewed their lives as just \"different.\" Overall, the major criticisms of graduate school included a lack of training in skills important to obtaining and administering grants, less than adequate formal teaching training and little guidance from mentors in publishing and finding a job. On the positive side, respondents were generally \"very satisfied\" with the mentoring they received and many respondents offered advice to graduate students about how to have a better mentoring experience. The respondents to this survey demonstrated great care and honesty in offering their nuanced opinions about their experiences and training. We hope that graduate programs, graduate students, administrators and others all benefit from their insights. We hope these results are reflected on by individuals and programs alike so that both can improve and make informed decisions about their future."}]
