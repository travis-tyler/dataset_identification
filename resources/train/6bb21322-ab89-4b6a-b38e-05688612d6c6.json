A 10-word recall task was used to assess SPE performance in relation to recency and primacy recall. MCI participants were classified as having Good SPE performance (high primacy and recency, Good SPE) or Poor SPE performance (low primacy only, LP-SPE; low recency only, LR-SPE; or both low, Low SPE). Poor SPE participants had reduced grey matter (GM) volumes and increased white matter hyperintensities (WMH) volumes. Participants with LP-SPE demonstrated reduced hippocampal GM volumes and were more likely to be ApoE \u03b54 carriers. LR-SPE was associated with higher WMH volumes. Presence of both greater WMH volumes and ApoE \u03b54 resulted in Low SPE. LP-SPE MCI participants had features typical of Alzheimer's disease. LR-SPE MCI was associated with increased WMH volumes, likely representing vascular pathology. SPE profiles are associated with distinct clinical patterns of MCI pathophysiology and could have potential as a clinical marker.\nwww.aging-us.com 3867 AGING long-term memory pathways, [7] pathways understood to be deficient in AD.\nUnlike AD, the patterns of SPE performance in participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) tend to be more varied, likely due to the heterogeneous nature of cognitive deficits found in MCI. Previous work has found that decreased primacy performance distinguishes between MCI participants and controls [8] and is associated with conversion to dementia. [9] However, Martin and colleagues [10] found MCI participants to have similar SPE patterns as controls, albeit with generally poorer performance. Additionally, Moser and colleagues [4] found SPE performance for amnestic and non-amnestic MCI participants to be indistinguishable from mild AD dementia and healthy control participants respectively, with neither group exhibiting any distinct SPE pattern. It is likely that this conflicting evidence is at least partially due to the groups of MCI participants studied having significant variances in SPE performance, including MCI participants with good SPE performance and participants with poor primacy and/or recency performance. Furthermore, the inverse of AD-type SPE (i.e. participants with poor recency performance and relatively preserved primacy) is not well studied. Understanding the risk factors and pathophysiology associated with MCI participants exhibiting the various SPE profiles can help explain how SPE manifests in early neurocognitive disorders, as well as better evaluate its utility as a clinical marker for neurocognitive disease progression.\nThis study aims to elucidate the relationship between SPE performance and other clinical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging features of MCI, and to identify the salient risk factors for distinguishing specific SPE profiles from control participants."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The serial position effect (SPE) [1, 2] is a well-established psychological phenomenon of free recall. In SPE, when memorizing and recalling a list of items that exceeds the average attention span, individuals tend to preferentially recall the first and last few items over the middle items. Specifically, the ready recall of the first few items is known as the primacy effect, and the recency effect refers to the ready recall of the last few items. This effect can be seen even in individuals with normal cognition, and assumes no other method is used to facilitate memorization (e.g. via chunking or mnemonics).\nSPE performance in participants with dementia has been well described in the literature. Specifically, participants with Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD) exhibit a characteristic SPE pattern of reduced primacy effect recall with relatively preserved recency effect. [3] More recent studies have focused mainly on the primacy effect and have consistently found impaired primacy function in participants with AD. [4, 5] This \"AD phenotype\" of SPE having a greater recency performance over primacy has been said to indicate a more passive learning approach, [6] and is consistent with functional MRI studies in young adults finding an association between recognition for primacy items and increased activation of"}, {"section_title": "Serial position effects differ between Alzheimer's and vascular features in mild cognitive impairment", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "CN and MCI characteristics", "text": "During the study period, 253 participants were recruited and completed study procedures. From there, a further 66 participants were dropped from analysis (37 with Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores <24, 29 with MRI images failing volumetric quality control due to excessive artifacts). The current study cohort comprised of the remaining 187 participants, of whom 177 were right handed. 68 participants were classified as cognitively normal (CN) and 119 were classified as MCI ( Figure 1 ). CN participants were significantly younger than MCI participants [mean age 62.34 (SD 6.80) vs. 67.61 (SD 7.72) years; p<0.001], were more highly educated [mean duration 13.49 (SD 3.12) vs. 11.14 (SD 3.39) years; p<0.001], and were more likely to be employed at the time [48.5% vs. 28.6%; p=0.023; remainder of participants were retired or homemakers]. CN and MCI participants did not differ in terms of gender (55.9% vs. 48.7% female; p=0.347) or race (94.1% vs. 89.9% Han Chinese; p=0.652; remainder of participants were a mix of Malay, Indian, Eurasian, and others).\nOf the 119 MCI participants, 40 (33.6% of MCI participants, 21 .4% of cohort) were classified as amnestic MCI (aMCI). All participants performed better in the primacy and recency regions than in the middle region, and MCI participants performed worse than CN participants in all three regions while generally exhibiting the same recall patterns (Figure 2A ). When considering amnestic status separately, aMCI participants have generally lower performance than CN and non-amnestic MCI (naMCI) participants while exhibiting a slightly increased recency performance over primacy performance ( Figure 2B )."}, {"section_title": "SPE performance comparison", "text": "67 (56.3%) of MCI participants were classified as Good SPE, and 52 (43.7%) were classified as Poor SPE ( Figure 1 ). Compared to CN participants, both Good SPE and Poor SPE participants were significantly older and less educated, and only the Poor SPE group had a greater proportion of Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) \u03b54 carriers than CN or Good SPE participants. In cognitive assessment both Good SPE and Poor SPE participants performed worse than CN in all tests at HolmBonferroni corrected significance levels, with Poor SPE participants generally performing poorer than Good SPE participants in all assessments except Digit Span Forward, Boston Naming Test, and the ADAS-Cog Maze (Table 1) .\nCN, MCI -Good SPE, and MCI -Poor SPE participants differed significantly in total grey matter (GM) volumes, as well as the bilateral occipital lobes, temporal lobes, and hippocampi. Post-hoc analysis showed that only the Poor SPE group had significantly reduced volumes compared to CN participants, and no differences were detected with the Good SPE participants. Similarly, white matter hyperintensities (WMH) volumes were significantly different, with Poor SPE participants having greater total and periventricular WMH volumes than CN participants. Global white matter (WM) volumes did not differ across the three groups ( Table 2) . As statistical significance was not achieved for global WM volumes, further breakdown of regional WM volumes was not explored. No significant differences between study conditions or (ApoE) polymorphism were found for GM volumes in the frontal lobe ( Figure 3A ) or temporal lobe ( Figure  3B ). There were study condition x ApoE status effects found for hippocampal GM and periventricular WMH (pvWMH) volumes. For hippocampal volumes in ApoE \u03b54 carriers, bilateral volumes were significantly lower in Poor SPE participants (p=0.001 for right, p=0.001 for left) and left hippocampus in Good SPE participants (p=0.096 for right, p=0.023 for left) compared to CN participants. In ApoE \u03b54 non-carriers, bilateral hippocampal volumes were lower in Poor SPE participants compared to CN (p=0.042 for right, p=0.012 for left), and hippocampal volumes did not differ between Good SPE and CN participants (p=0.259 for right p=0.516 for left) ( Figure 3C ). For pvWMH, volumes were significantly greater in ApoE \u03b54 negative Poor SPE participants compared to CN (p=0.002), but not for Good SPE participants (p=0.947) compared to CN. In ApoE \u03b54 carriers, pvWMH volumes in both Good SPE and Poor SPE were greater than CN, but this did not reach statistical significance (p=0.153 for Good SPE vs. CN; p=0.089 for Poor SPE vs. CN) ( Figure  3D )."}, {"section_title": "SPE profiles comparison", "text": "Of the Poor SPE participants, 14 (11.8% of all MCI participants) were classified as Low SPE, 25 (21.0%) were low primacy only SPE (LP-SPE), and 13 (10.9%) were low recency only SPE (LR-SPE) (Figure 1 ). Checking the performance of the three SPE regions (primacy, middle, and recency) across the five groups showed results that corresponded to their classification criteria. Although the middle region was not used to classify participants and was not the focus of this analysis, it was noted that middle region performance was similar between CN and Good SPE participants, and between Low SPE, LP-SPE, and LR-SPE. Also, even though CN participants were not selected based on their SPE performance, their performance in all three regions, including the middle region, was noted to be better than all other MCI groups ( Figure 4 ).\nIn terms of cognitive performance, \u03c7 2 tests showed significant differences across all study conditions for all cognitive measures (Table 3) . Table 4 details p values from posthoc pairwise comparisons for cognitive assessments between CN, Good SPE, LP-SPE, LR-SPE, and Low SPE participants, and statistical significance was tested at Holm-Bonferroni corrected levels. For episodic memory, CN participants universally performed better in Word Recognition than the MCI groups regardless of SPE performance. Additionally, LP-SPE participants also performed worse than CN, Good SPE, and LR-SPE participants in Visual Reproduction. LP-SPE, LR-SPE, and Low SPE participants generally performed poorer than CN participants in attention tests. Working memory performance was only significantly better in CN participants compared to Good SPE, and also compared to LP-SPE when considering Digit Span Backwards. For executive function, all MCI SPE groups performed poorer than CN participants, with LP-SPE also notably poorer than Good SPE. LP-SPE were poorer than CN in language tests, with Low SPE additionally poorer than CN in fruit fluency. Finally, LP-SPE participants were poorer than CN and Good SPE participants in Block Design, a measure of visuospatial orientation. There were very few significant differences in cognitive performances amongst the SPE profiles, the main exceptions being between Good SPE and LP-SPE. After correcting for age, education, and employment status, Low SPE participants had reduced hippocampal GM volumes and significantly greater periventricular WMH volumes compared to CN participants (Table 5 ).\nFor the logistic regression analysis, all models started with age, secondary school completion status (equivalent to at least 10 years of formal education), total frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobe GM volumes, bilateral hippocampal GM volumes, pvWMH volume, and ApoE \u03b54 status as candidate predictor variables before undergoing elimination, with scanner type left in as a locked covariate ( Table 6 ). The ApoE \u03b54 allele, education, and pvWMH were identified to be significantly associated with the Low SPE condition (Model A). For LP-SPE participants (The AD type condition), ApoE \u03b54, education, and left hippocampal GM volumes were significant (Model B). Only pvWMH and education were significant for the LR-SPE group (Model C), and only age and education were significant for the Good SPE group (Model D). Model fit was good for all models except Model D."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In this analysis, we found that poor SPE performance in MCI participants was associated with poorer neuroimaging outcomes, and specifically reduced hippocampal GM volumes compared to CN amongst ApoE \u03b54 positive participants. MCI participants with the LP-SPE profile (the AD-type SPE profile of low primacy with high recency) had more hippocampal volume loss and greater ApoE \u03b54 prevalence. Participants with the LR-SPE (the inverse of the ADtype profile of high primacy with low recency) had higher WMH volumes. Participants poor in both aspects of SPE had both higher WMH volumes and higher prevalence of ApoE \u03b54. MCI participants with good SPE profiles mainly had age and education differences compared to controls.\nThese neuroimaging findings were supported in part by cognitive performance findings. LP-SPE participants were the group that more often than not performed consistently poorer than the relatively healthier groups (Good SPE and CN) in measures of episodic memory and executive function, domains known to be affected While it has already been established that clinically diagnosed dementia [3] and MCI participants [4, 10] exhibit SPE deficits, these findings show that MCI participants with \"AD-like\" LP-SPE might already be experiencing some level of AD-like changes in episodic memory, executive function, and hippocampal structural changes, suggestive of prodromal AD. The "}, {"section_title": "AGING", "text": "\"inverse\" LR-SPE profile, a group not well studied in prior research, have greater levels of WMH, a surrogate measure of cerebrovascular disease, as well as impairments in attention and executive function. This suggests that these participants are likely experiencing vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), where their longterm memory pathways are relatively unaffected but their cholinergic pathways have been compromised by WMH. This seems to be corroborated by how Low SPE participants have both vascular changes and risk factors for AD. Indeed, Low SPE participants seem to have markedly greater amounts of pvWMH and reduced hippocampal volumes, suggesting that these participants might be experiencing more advanced pathology than the other SPE groups.\nThe findings also suggest that Good SPE participants are likely not experiencing any underlying observable brain pathology, despite exhibiting some reduced cognitive performance compared to healthy controls. Although the current findings suggest age and education as the main drivers here, the relatively low pseudo-R 2 for Model D suggests a large degree of variability not explained by the current predictors. Other factors associated with transient cognitive symptoms in the elderly, such as lifestyle factors and sleep disturbances [11] , may be at play here, and further research will be needed to uncover their effects.\nThis study, and the preceding research, help to solidify the relationship between SPE and pathological brain changes in cognitive decline, and demonstrate that these effects can be seen even in pre-dementia participants. Given the consistency of SPE performance in relation to AD-and VCI-related pathology, SPE performance has the potential to be a viable clinical marker for these pathologies in pre-clinical neurocognitive disorders. Characterizing MCI participants by their raw recall performance as a singular number, without consideration for where the deficits lie temporally, may have the effect of making them appear to be AD-like in nature, while ignoring other potential non-AD contributions. This makes SPE profiles especially relevant for participants that score low in recall tasks, where their correctly recalled words may be loaded mainly in the primacy regions, in the recency regions, or in neither. These three scenarios would be linked to different risk profiles, and yet illicit similar total scores in immediate word recall (IWR). Furthermore, looking at IWR would circumvent some of the limitations of delayed word recall (DWR) performance across different study designs, such as the varying lengths of the latent period between the immediate and delayed tasks, and the nature of the filler task used in between, if any.\nThe finding of MCI participants with poor primacy performance exhibiting prodromal AD features is in agreement with prior evidence of poorer delayed primacy performance in cognitively intact individuals with smaller hippocampal volumes and increased CSF hyperphosphorylated tau levels, [12] and AD-type SPE performance in asymptomatic participants with a familial history of AD. [13] The use of primacy region performance in MCI in predicting time to AD conversion has been shown to be useful alone, and enhanced when coupled with CSF amyloid investigations. [14] Increasing accuracy in identifying prodromal AD participants is becoming of increasing importance, especially in clinical trials of diseasemodifying drugs, where participant selection issues are one of the many difficulties associated with the high failure rate of AD drug trials. [15] Identifying participants by their specific SPE profiles may be more accurate in distinguishing MCI participants with AD pathology from other etiologies than using primacy performance alone. It may also be feasible for the vascular-type and overall low-type SPE profiles to be used to identify VCI or mixed etiology participants for clinical trials focusing on those patient groups, although further work may be needed to properly elucidate the mechanisms behind the non-AD SPE profiles.\nThis study is novel in its use of distinct SPE profiles to characterize MCI participants more informatively, rather than studying individual aspects of SPE alone. Despite this, certain limitations need to be acknowledged. This includes the pseudorandom nature of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment ScaleCognitive (ADAS-Cog) IWR task used in this design; while this was done to avoid the effects of word association or mnemonics in aiding recall, it also meant that the serial position of the subsequent DWR words were unrelated to IWR and had no inherent significance beyond the raw score. Thus, SPE performance in DWR could not be simultaneously studied in this design.\nIn conclusion, we find that specific SPE profiles in MCI are suggestive of underlying AD or vascular pathology, and demonstrate it to be a useful clinical marker that is consistent and easy to administer. Further studies will be needed to demonstrate these effects in larger cohorts, and to observe the associations of these SPE profiles with amyloid or tau imaging, CSF investigations, and functional connectivity via fMRI studies."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subject recruitment", "text": "Participants were from a cross-sectional research study carried out at the National Neuroscience Institute, Singapore and Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore that recruited individuals with MCI and healthy controls between July 2013 and March 2016.

[21] Furthermore, participants underwent a comprehensive cognitive assessment battery designed to assess the following cognitive subdomains: episodic memory via the fourth version of the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS-IV) Visual Reproduction II subtest [22] and the ADAS-Cog Word Recognition test, [21] attention via the fourth version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) Symbol Search subtest [23] and the Color Trails Test (CTT) 1 subtest; [24] working memory via the WAIS-IV Digit Span Forward and Backward subtests, [23] executive function via the CTT 2 subtest [24] and the Frontal Assessment Battery; [25] language via fruit semantic fluency and the Hong Kong version of the Boston Naming Test (BNT); [26] and visuospatial orientation via the ADAS-Cog Maze subtest [21] and the WAIS-IV Block Design subtest. [23] SPE performance was assessed using the 10-word immediate word recall (IWR) task in the ADAS-Cog [21] . Participants were shown a list of 10 sequential words on flash cards at approximately two seconds per word. The words were one or two syllables long and were relatively common concrete nouns. Participants were told to read each word out loud and to memorize them. At the end of the exposure, participants were asked to repeat as many words as they can regardless of order, taking up to a maximum of two minutes. The trial exposure and recall challenge was then repeated two more times, each using the same 10 words in a pseudorandomized order. After approximately 5 minutes, during which a filler task is conducted (in this case, the ADAS-Cog Instructions and Constructional Praxis tasks), a delayed word recall (DWR) task is carried out. During DWR, participants are challenged to repeat as many of the 10 words from the immediate word with no repeat exposure prior to challenge.\nIn each IWR trial, the primacy region was defined as the first three words, and the recency region was defined as the last three words. The remaining four words were labeled as the middle region. A primacy score would then be generated using the total number of correctly recalled words in the primacy regions of all three trials, out a total possible score of 9. A score of <6 (<2 out of 3 words for each trial on average) denoted poor primacy performance. Recency scores, and classifications for poor recency performance, were similarly derived using the nine recency region words. These criteria were used to classify MCI participants into the various SPE groups as described below.
