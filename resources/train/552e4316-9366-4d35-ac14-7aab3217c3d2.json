[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Environmental modeling complements long-term ocean observation programs; together, these are helping scientists to better understand climate and marine ecosystems, as well as human impacts and vulnerabilities [1]. More effective prediction, communication, mitigation, and response to coastal processes on multiple time scales are essential to the welfare of coastal communities and to the sustainability of coastal ecosystems and human infrastructure [2][3][4]. Validation of model predictions requires continuous long-term data collection and continuing refinement and testing of model codes to ensure that performance meets or exceeds benchmarks [5]. These are some of the reasons that coastal ocean observatories have emerged as integrated, operational suites of instruments, permanently deployed to measure meteorological, oceanographic, and geophysical phenomena. Development of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS \u00ae ) and linked Regional Associations has improved the capability of the scientific and operational oceanography community to monitor and forecast environmental changes and hazardous events. By way of the Southeastern Universities Research Association (SURA) Coastal Ocean Observing and Prediction Program (SCOOP) and the subsequent Coastal Ocean Model Testbed (COMT) project, numerous collaborators have advanced ocean modeling programs supported by observing technologies. WaveWatch III \u00ae [23], Eulerian-Lagrangian CIRCulation (ELCIRC) model [24], Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) [25]; WAve Model (WAM) [26]; Curvilinear Hydrodynamics in Three Dimensions (CH3D) [27], and ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) [28]. Model runs were performed on grid-enabled high-performance computing resources. The SURAgrid network provided a uniform portal to address diverse applications. For example, a multi-member wave model ensemble was run on grid-enabled computers at Louisiana State University (LSU) and the University of Florida. Storm surge simulations were run during Hurricane KATRINA and the results, along with observed waves, were made available in real time on the SCOOP \"OpenIOOS\" website."}, {"section_title": "Data Stewardship", "text": "The SCOOP program emphasized web-based mapping standards and geographic information systems (GIS) applications that displayed high-resolution base layers. The OGC Interoperability Experiment completed in 2007 provided a wealth of guidelines and best practices examples that allow widespread community participation in interoperable data sharing of various in-situ observation data for the U.S. IOOS. SCOOP implemented open standards that formed the foundation for the discovery, use, and integration of scientific data sets. Visualization infrastructure included the automatic transfer of hurricane-modeled forecasts to GIS formats [29,30]. The combined tasks provided data discovery and access capabilities for the whole SCOOP community."}, {"section_title": "Computer Infrastructure", "text": "SURA grid allowed participating organizations to share high performance computing (HPC) resources available on the \"grid\" to provide an opportunity and mechanism to share excess computational capabilities on one campus with other participants for research needs [31]. Furthermore, an OpenIOOS website primarily served as a community-building tool and a technology demonstration for the ocean observing community. The infrastructure capability delivered data using the OGC Web Feature Service (WFS), which included quality assurance/quality control procedures that ensured the highest quality data and reliability. Computer infrastructure was key to collaboration and, in addition to software, included job scheduling and management, storage, and hardware for the SCOOP grid. Middleware requirements were identified and developed to support a number of HPC needs such as dynamic scheduling, allocations, and resource provisioning [12]."}, {"section_title": "Community Engagement", "text": "A SCOOP Education Virtual Appliance developed by the University of Florida enhanced the ability of scientists and non-scientists to understand the primary factors influencing coastal and estuarine processes. SCOOP partnered with the Gulf of Mexico Coastal Ocean Observing System and this interaction was critical in transferring research results to benefit those running GNOME (General NOAA Operational Modeling Environment), a modeling tool used by NOAA's Office of Response and Restoration [11]. During SCOOP, a grid-enabled archive was designed and deployed at LSU. Concomitant data management services were critical to supporting the researchers. The archive ingested files arriving over different protocols, and a client tool was developed using a grid application toolkit, which could retrieve files using either File Transfer Protocol for grid computing (GRIDFTP) or HTTP. Queries to the archive were made based on metadata [32]. Ensemble modeling, querying, and downloading files from the archive and file transfers were among the capabilities facilitated by the SCOOP grid. The Gulf of Mexico grid was tested in real time during Hurricane Katrina [12]. From 2003 through 2009, SCOOP Program participants produced over 40 publications, including student theses, book chapters, journal articles, and conference proceedings. Modeling findings included the need for more data, new sensors, and expanded observational programs, especially in the nearshore. Some examples include the need for more wave observations to improve wave forecasts [33]. Improved process representation, better model coupling, incorporation of data assimilation techniques, and testing of real-time models were identified as future requirements at the same time that the emerging U.S. IOOS was beginning to provide the foundation needed to establish a testbed to compare and improve models."}, {"section_title": "Collaboration during SCOOP", "text": "SURA established a viable structure to enable partners to comprise SCOOP, a big science project.

The groundwork was laid for collaboration by facilitating scientific interaction on numerous levels, ranging from project meetings to annual all-hands meetings.

The long-range vision from the outset of this program has been to increase the accuracy, reliability, and scope of operational coastal and ocean forecasting products and to be responsive to the needs and concerns of operational end users. Through this program, SURA helped to facilitate technology transition (e.g., numerical models) to operational organizations such as the Navy and NOAA. These operational organizations, while collaborating with academic researchers, also benefitted from the collaborative environment and ongoing university research to improve operational models, tools, and products. The SCOOP program demonstrated the importance of using numerical models to improve predictions of the impacts of events such as Hurricane Katrina. Table 2 provides general information related to models developed by community modelers throughout the United States and Canada. Assessments of the ability of various models to predict ocean properties and circulation was considered essential for operational organizations such as NOAA. The intent of COMT was to build on SCOOP and develop a procedure to utilize new generations of models to aid our understanding of extreme events such as inundation and chronic environmental conditions such as hypoxia. Consistent with NOAA's goals, the early COMT program was intended to enable participation by the coastal ocean modeling community in evaluating and improving models that might ultimately become operational. The COMT infrastructure and programs allowed the participants to share numerical model code, results, observations, software tools, and common evaluation methodologies. The aim was to aid the transition of promising models to operational use in addressing issues such as inundation and hypoxia. Collaboratively written project materials from semiannual progress reports and annual meetings are accessible online at https://comt.ioos.us/. Figure 1 illustrates the pathways by which COMT research activities were transitioned to operations [34]. Table 2.

Phase 2 COMT projects further advanced the operational use of models for the prediction of extreme events and chronic conditions [39]. Of particular importance was modeling of low or depleted oxygen (hypoxia) and the storm surge inundation of coastal areas adjacent to steep sloped bathymetry. Table 3 lists the Phase 2 participants. The five projects of COMT Phase 2 are summarized as follows. (1) Estuarine Hypoxia Modeling in Chesapeake Bay The Chesapeake Bay receives and transforms nutrients from tributaries such as the Susquehanna, Potomac, Rappahannock, York, and James rivers before they are exported to the adjacent continental shelf. Although the water quality of the Chesapeake Bay has been estimated from in situ observations [40,41], uncertainties associated with inter-annually varying hydrological conditions persist. For these reasons, the estuarine hypoxia project focused on quantifying the temporal and spatial variability of low and harmful dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations using a variety of models that were adapted from ROMS, EFDC, and CH3D for the Chesapeake Bay. The project utilized scenario-based modeling of hypoxia in the Chesapeake Bay and compared the skill of multiple Chesapeake Bay models to predict salinity, temperature, stratification, and DO concentration. Data for inter-comparisons with model output were derived from the Chesapeake Bay Interpretive Buoy System (CBIBS) and satellite imagery. After completing a multiple-model inter-comparison of nine different models of the bay, the project concluded that the use of multiple models should support decision-making by managers. Most models were found to have difficulty resolving key drivers (winds, tides, solar radiation) of DO variability, but all the models exhibited some level of skill to estimate DO variability. Simple oxygen models and complex biogeochemical models all reproduced observed DO variability well, but the ensemble reproduced the observations better than any individual model. Successes have helped to determine the role of estuarine processes and climate change in enhancing or mitigating DO concentrations [42][43][44][45]. As indicated in Figure 2, forecasts of DO in the Chesapeake Bay are made available to the public through the Mid-Atlantic Regional Association Coastal Ocean Observing System (MARACOOS) Oceans Map (http://oceansmap.maracoos.org/) and through the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS). The estuarine hypoxia research included collaborators from VIMS, University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and Delta Modeling Associates. Technology transfer from this project is being planned through MARACOOS and ultimately to enhance NOAA's Chesapeake Bay Operational Forecast System. Research advances were described during a stakeholder workshop that was held at VIMS on 26 April 2016. Future improvements in hypoxia simulations will depend on advances in the ability to model the depth of the mixed layer."}, {"section_title": "COMT: Phase 1", "text": "The initial phase of the COMT program ran from 2010 to 2013. Projects focused on modeling phenomena affecting the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts. The emphasis was on inundation, estuarine hypoxia in the Chesapeake Bay, shelf hypoxia in the Northern Gulf of Mexico, and development of improved tools for model assessment. SURA provided the COMT program with collaboration leadership to facilitate sharing of HPC resources and knowledge transfer, especially implementation of advances made by the cyberinfrastructure team. During this initial phase, COMT provided guidance on the accuracy, robustness, execution speed, and implementation requirements (e.g., resolution, parameterization, computer capacity) of models such as ADCIRC, FVCOM, SELFE, SWAN, and WaveWatch III. Models were evaluated for eventual operational use by \"hind-cast\" comparison with data from the National Data Buoy Center; NOAA tide gauges; USGS permanent and temporary gauges; the Gulf of Mexico Coastal and Ocean Observing System, and other complementary sources from Hurricane Bob (1991) in the Gulf of Maine and Hurricanes Rita (2005) and Ike (2008) in the Gulf of Mexico. Identical grids and forcing were used in comparisons of the coupled unstructured surge-wave models, ADCIRC+SWAN, FVCOM+SWAN, and SELFE+WWM, in runs carried out for Hurricanes Rita and Ike. The Galveston Basin grid, along with the Gulf of Mexico grid and a local grid for Galveston and Sabine Pass, were used for runs of SLOSH, which failed to capture the Hurricane Ike forerunner and underestimated storm surge height [35]. The three unstructured models performed much better at reproducing observed processes, yielded similar results, and showed variances comparable to observations. SLOSH deviated more from observations than did the unstructured grid models in all cases. As expected, the runtime for SLOSH was much faster than was the case for the other models. All of the models reproduced important oceanographic processes, with minimal water level fluctuation bias and comparable variances versus observations. SLOSH performed better on the Sabine Pass Basin grid for Hurricane Rita owing to differences in forerunner surge, which is generally caused by shore-parallel winds and resulting currents [36]. On the Extra-Tropical Storm Surge (ETSS) grid, SLOSH showed minimal bias for either storm, although its scatter was quite large due to the nearly 5 km resolution in coastal areas. As indicated in progress reports (see https://comt.ioos.us/), SLOSH differences from observed data were greater than those from the three unstructured grid models. The largest deviation in model performance was observed in execution speed and scalability. The implicit time stepping scheme of SELFE coupled to WWM performed well at small numbers of cores but scaled poorly at larger numbers of cores. Coupled ADCIRC and SWAN computing infrastructure was described for comparisons of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita [37]. ADCIRC coupled to SWAN during COMT resulted in improved scaling and absolute performance when more than 128 cores were used per run. SLOSH, which runs on a single core, is not configured to utilize modern parallel computing architecture. The COMT project investigators reported that runtimes for ADCIRC on a single core were more than 10 times longer than for SLOSH on the ETSS grid, even after the SLOSH runtimes were normalized for the number of grid nodes (https://comt.ioos.us/). SLOSH, as described by [38], is used operationally to combine large ensembles of model runs for probabilistic flood forecasting. However, the accuracy of SLOSH-based probabilistic forecasts should be assessed by comparing select, individual SLOSH runs with similar runs using higher resolution unstructured grid models, as discussed above. A description of the program from its inception and a compilation of scientific results is presented in a series of 16 scientific papers in a special issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research [34]."}, {"section_title": "9", "text": "Center for Environmental Science, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and Delta Modeling Associates.

Hypoxia research in the NGOM examined causes of the temporal and spatial variability of low and harmful DO concentrations using the NCOM, FVCOM, and ROMS models [45]. The combination of low DO and high nitrate creates initially low DO conditions near the bottom, but these are not hypoxic. High phytoplankton concentrations produced in response to the input of nitrogen and other macronutrients to shelf surface waters, if not grazed, sink to the bottom, where it decomposes, consuming oxygen and creating bottom hypoxia. Other physical factors impacting hypoxia include stratification of Gulf waters, which amplifies the effects of excess nitrogen from the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River Basin [48]. The models have supplemented research cruises to sample the NGOM Dead Zone and improve nitrogen management, including agricultural management and the need for wetland and riparian buffer restoration. Some of the most recent modeling results from this study suggest that the climate changes that are underway probably exacerbate eutrophication and hypoxia [51,52]."}, {"section_title": "(5) COMT Cyberinfrastructure", "text": "The cyberinfrastructure component of COMT was designed to facilitate collaboration across the various institutions and modeling teams by enabling exploration, storing research results, and providing community access and tools.

Collaboration has underpinned program success from the outset, within the academic community and, importantly, between academia, corporations, and operational users. Margaret Davidson, the former director of NOAA's Office of Coastal Management, advocated for creating a collaborative virtual community or \"collaboratorium.\" SURA promoted such a virtual infrastructure for COMT researchers. Partners such as LSU helped SURA to leverage storage, networks, HPC, heterogeneous multi-provider services integration, datacentric service models, and security for data processing and storage. The COMT collaboratorium IT support team collected and processed high-volume and diverse data. COMT has showcased that scientific collaboration requires dedicated effort and mutual acceptance of goals, critical assessments of diverse approaches, iterative updates, incremental improvements to understanding, promotion of new paradigms, and effective communication with a hierarchy of researchers and operational users.

Operational organizations remain a key beneficiary for programs such as COMT that allow researchers using differing methodologies to analyze common data sets and inter-compare model-based coastal ocean state estimates using standardized assessment metrics."}, {"section_title": "New Perspectives and Lessons Learned", "text": "SCOOP and COMT have demonstrated that collaborations involving multiple organizations and stakeholders can be effective in moving modeling innovations forward and transitioning research to operations. Numerous investigators [5,[54][55][56][57][58][59][60] continue to highlight the importance of team science modeling experiments that are supported by real-time data and software tools that can be used across multiple scales and physical phenomena. For this reason, SURA's approach has included top-down and bottom-up communication to ensure that all participants were aware of progress, challenges, and achievements. Key lessons learned are as follows: (1) Collaboration among team members and across projects facilitated innovation. SURA held annual principal investigator and partner meetings where researchers were able to work with operators to address issues such as the consequences of missing physics in models and the efficacy of compensatory parameterizations. In some situations, traditional diagnostics were found to be inadequate to fully assess errors in modeling processes and new approaches were developed. We expect that the role of balanced collaboration and completion for spurring innovation will carry over into future testbeds. (2) The use of open standards and engaging with the OGC facilitated the integration of data from different regional observatories. It also helped in the discovery of observations and model output necessary for the real-time visualization of satellite images, sensors, and numerical data using common GIS applications. (3) Collaboration among academia, government, and industry was effective, as evidenced by the use of results from SLOSH and ADCIRC (coupled with spectral wave models) to support emergency managers during Hurricanes Irma and Maria during September and October 2017. Whereas SCOOP and COMT have exemplified a transdisciplinary approach to research, further improvements are required to involve the social sciences. International researchers involved in resilience studies have described some strategies and challenges for future transdisciplinary collaborations in coastal science [61]. (4) Although progress has been made in understanding connections between physical and ecological processes, understanding of coupled natural and social systems has largely been lacking. Combining new observational strategies and modeling techniques must include factors related to economics, populations, and disease in relation to natural processes. (5) The need continues for multi-agency investment for linked observations and modeling to predict hazards associated with severe storms, shoreline erosion, and sea level rise. Operational organizations such as NOAA and the Navy require ongoing advances in today's modeling infrastructure, including in situ sensor networks, improved process representations, incorporation of data assimilation, better model coupling, and testing of real-time models. (6) Networks such as U.S. IOOS provide observations that can be used to compare and improve models in a variety of coastal zones. However, demonstrations of modeling output to meet the information needs of decision makers should be planned prior to the occurrence of a natural disaster. Catastrophic flooding events that have followed extreme rainfall, such as in East Baton Rouge during August 2016, demonstrate the need for improvements in the coupling of hydrology and ocean models and expansion in the hierarchy of available models and observations to help quantify sources of uncertainty in simulations. (7) Continued research is needed to determine how initial state, coupling of system components, and changes in external forcing contribute to predictability. It is apparent through COMT that predictions needed to support many decision-makers require increased resolution using HPC and \"Big Data\" resources. COMT has illustrated that seamless prediction from minutes to decades is model-and resolution-dependent and that the process of understanding model errors and determining optimal resolution and ensemble size to predict useful measures, such as means or extremes, can only be advanced through collaboration between researchers and operators. (8) Some of the operational needs of federal, state, and local organizations responsible for emergency response, coastal protection, resource management, research, and national defense are described in [62]. The Navy needs to model the coastal ocean to maintain control of vital areas of the ocean and numerical modeling of environmental factors that impact naval operations. NOAA requires improved understanding of the connections among storms, hazards, society, and ecosystems. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers partnered with several COMT projects and benefits through improved data and models to operate hundreds of coastal ports and navigation channels throughout the nation. States bordering the Chesapeake Bay and the Gulf of Mexico must cope with and mitigate the effects of hypoxia contributing to dead zones. SCOOP and COMT have improved modeling capabilities and expanded environmental intelligence for use by decision-makers and thereby have helped to create more resilient coastal communities [63]. (9) An important component of the COMT project was the effort in sharing HPC resources, knowledge transfer, and especially the implementation of advances made by the COMT cyberinfrastructure team. These accomplishments provide the basis for the next generation of COMT projects and soon to be implemented operational programs within the NOAA-IOOS structure."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Prognosis", "text": "What we have described in this paper has been the evolution of a methodology that is underpinned not by new technology but predominantly by collaboration. The National Research Council reported, \"Without a strong, effective collaboration among the government, academic, and private sectors, the general public would not have been the beneficiary of the great advances in weather and climate science and technology over the last 50 years\" [64]. Development and implementation of SCOOP and COMT has involved university researchers, government scientists, private industry, community-based organizations, and policy-makers working together to (a) define the problems to be addressed and the questions that need to be answered; (b) evolve and improve modeling methodologies within a collaborative environment; (c) interpret research results in terms of their significance for community and policy change, and (d) disseminate the research findings and advocate for change. Truly collaborative teams respect the knowledge and contributions that each partner brings to the project to understand the complex problems facing coastal communities so that science-based responses to those problems can be implemented. There is a variety of multi-disciplinary approaches currently used on large projects. Three elements are central to them all: (1) diversity, (2) collaboration, and (3) a community-based focus. Where numerical models are concerned, community-based implies open source models. Projects such as COMT connect researchers from multiple interdisciplinary fields to solve complex problems.
