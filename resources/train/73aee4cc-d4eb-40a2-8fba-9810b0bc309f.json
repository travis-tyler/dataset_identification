Second, universities provide a source of expertise for local businesses, thus enhancing the productivity of industries already established in the area. It is this role that historically led many states to direct university research to targeted subjects: Wisconsin, dairy products; Iowa, corn; Colorado and other western states, mining; North Carolina and Kentucky, tobacco; Illinois and Indiana, railroad technologies; and Oklahoma and Texas, oil exploration and refining (Goldin & Katz, 1998, 1999Rosenberg & Nelson, 1994). This practical focus on issues of local interest declined after World War II with the advent of federal funding directed toward defense and health-related problems (Rosenberg & Nelson, 1994). Third, and related, key technologies are developed in universities that eventually lead to new businesses and job growth. 1 University faculty can play key roles in the establishment of these new firms. Although it is common to think of this as a post-double-helix phenomenon, the practice of university spin-offs began far earlier. 2 Fourth, knowledge from basic and applied research conducted at the university spills over and can be key in fostering research and development (R&D) in close geographic proximity to the university, as has been demonstrated in numerous studies of the role that geography plays in innovation (Audretsch & Feldman, 1996a, 1996bJaffe, 1989). 3 Fifth, strong universities can encourage firms to relocate to a state by providing highly trained employees, a reservoir of expertise, and amenities that are valued by the company and its employees. Finally, strong universities provide bragging rights for a state and thus enhance the state's profile. 4 Doctoral education in science and engineering is critical to the role that universities play in fostering economic development. Graduate students are key inputs in knowledge production and are thus crucial to the role that universities play in the creation of knowledge and in technology transfer. Strong graduate students also enhance the reputation of a university, providing states with bragging rights. Perhaps most important, doctoral programs train individuals who, on graduation, contribute to productivity. Although industry has a long tradition of hiring Ph.D.s in certain fields, such as chemistry, as industry-directed R&D labs grew during the last century, industry increasingly looked to doctoral programs to staff the labs. New Ph.D. graduates bring several productivity-enhancing attributes with them when they join industry. These include knowledge and access to networks. The knowledge embodied in recent graduates can be especially important to industrial R&D laboratories because it facilitates the movement of tacit knowledge, which, by its very nature, is not readily transferable via codified sources. Moreover, the placement of graduate students plays a key role in creating networks and strengthening existing ones. Such networks have been found to relate to firm performance (Powell, Koput, Smith-Doerr, & Owen-Smith, 1999;Zucker & Darby, 1997). 5 In a recent study, Agrawal and Henderson (2002) interviewed 68 faculty members in engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), all of whom had patented and licensed at least one invention. They asked them to \"estimate the portion of the influence your research has had on industry activities, including research, development, and production\" that was transmitted through a number of channels (p. 53). Consulting headed the list, with a weight of 25.1%, followed by publication at 18.5%. Consistent with the above discussion, recruitment of MIT graduates played a role, being a close third at 16.8%. 6 Despite the role placements play, both directly and indirectly, in fostering economic development, little work has been done to document and analyze these placements. This article takes a first step at rectifying this deficiency, using a newly created source of information regarding the placement of new Ph.D. graduates with firms. Of particular interest is the placement of students with the top 200 R&D companies or their subsidiaries, given the important role such firms play in research and development. A major focus of the article is the role of geography. In particular, we are interested in whether Ph.D.s who go to industry stay in the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) or state where they received their training or leave after graduation. A related question is the degree to which destination MSAs recruit from their own backyard or import Ph.D.s from other MSAs and states. Data for this article were drawn from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED), administered by Science Resources Statistics (SRS) of the National Science Foundation (1997)(1998)(1999) to all doctoral Universities provide several key elements that fuel economic development."}, {"section_title": "Doctoral education in science and engineering is critical to the role that universities play in fostering economic development.", "text": "recipients in the United States on completion of their degrees.

Although the SED has always asked graduates to provide information concerning industrial placements, the identity of the firm has been available to researchers only since 1997and then only in verbatim form. We have recently used these verbatim files to code the identity of the firm and determine whether the new Ph.D. graduate was placed at a top 200 R&D firm or one of its subsidiaries. 7 This article is exploratory in nature, examining how our initial findings inform the discussion of the role that universities play in economic development. The article is organized in five sections. First, we place our work in context. Using the biennial Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) , we examine the deployment of Ph.D.s in science and engineering by sector and how this deployment has changed over time. Next, we summarize our overall findings concerning industrial placements of those graduating from 1997 to 1999. We then focus on the role of geography by examining location of the doctoral students' training institutions and the locations of the hiring firms. The degree to which high-placement MSAs recruit new hires from universities located in the same MSA or state is also examined. We draw conclusions in the final section of the article."}, {"section_title": "DEPLOYMENT OF PH.D.S BY SECTOR: THE BIG PICTURE", "text": "In 1999, three in eight of all seasoned science and engineering (S&E) Ph.D.s who had received their training in the United States were working in industry, whereas slightly more than one in four were working in a tenure-track position in academe. 8 A quarter of a century earlier, fewer than 30% of all S&E Ph.D.s were working in industry, and more than 45% were in tenure-track faculty positions. These trends are explored in Figure 1, which shows the number of S&E Ph.D.s by sector of employment and labor market status from 1973 to 1999. The counts come from the Survey of Doctorate Recipients, a biennial survey administered by SRS to a sample of all individuals who received their Ph.D. training in the United States and who indicated at the time of receipt that they planned to stay in the U.S. after receipt of the degree. 9 The data are displayed in the following seven categories: tenure-track faculty, other academic sectors (which include nonfaculty positions of clinical researchers and postdoctoral fellows), industry, government, other full-time, part-time employed and unemployed, and out of the labor force. The sample is restricted to those who are 65 and younger and have been out of graduate school for 5 or more years. Focusing on the seasoned 5year-plus group provides the opportunity for observing individuals after they have had sufficient time to settle into a career path. The counts clearly show that Ph.D. employment in industry grew sufficiently rapidly so that by 1989, industry surpassed the tenure-track academic sector as the most common employer of seasoned Ph.D.s and, by the mid-1990s, surpassed total academic employment, regardless of tenuretrack status. These trends were evident across all fields. Moreover, in certain fields, such as chemistry, physics, and astronomy, not only did industry grow more quickly than the academic sector, the number of Ph.D.s working in academe in tenure-track faculty positions actually declined. Field differences are explored in Figure 2, which shows the percentage of seasoned Ph.D.s working in industry over time for the following five broad fields: the life sciences, engineering, chemistry, physics and astronomy, and math and computer sciences. Several patterns stand out. First, we see that, although chemistry has the tradition of being the field with the highest percentage of Ph.D.s working in industry, in recent years its position has been challenged by engineering. We also see that industrial employment among those trained in the life sciences is low relative to the other fields, but the probability of employment in industry has more than doubled in the past 25 years, so that by 1999, more than one in four life scientists were working in industry. The percentage of scientists and engineers trained in math and computer science working in industry has grown even more, reflecting in part the growing importance of information technology in industry."}, {"section_title": "DEPLOYMENT OF NEW PH.D.S IN INDUSTRY", "text": "Although we know that industry plays an important role in the employment of Ph.D.s and that this role has increased, 10 to date virtually nothing is known about the characteristics of the employing firms or the providence of the Ph.D.s working in industry. Here, we focus on addressing these shortcomings. We focus on new Ph.D.s because they are key elements in the role universities play in economic development and because data are available to permit such study. 11 The specific data come from the SED (National Science Foundation, 1973-1999, which asks Ph.D. recipients to \"name the organization and geographic location where you will work or study.\" Although this question has been asked for many years, for those going to industry, the names of firms have been readily available in verbatim form only since 1997. 12 Before then, information concerning the location of the industrial placement was not recorded. As part of a larger project, we have undertaken the not inconsiderable task of coding the verbatim records by firm name and location. Here we present our initial findings from this research. This approach is not without its limitations. Two are particularly notable. First, a sizable number of Ph.D. recipients do not have definite plans at the time they complete the SED and thus do not list a destination. In 1999, for example, approximately 35% of scientists and engineers were without definite plans at the time they completed the survey (Sanderson, Dugoni, Hoffer, & Myers, 2000). This means that the SED undercounts firm placements, as well as all other types of placements. Second, initial placements with firms undercount placements of recent Ph.D.s in the industrial sector. The primary reason for this is the heavy incidence of postdoctoral appointments in academe immediately following receipt of the degree. Some indication of this undercount is given  . NOTE: Only those who have held a doctorate for 5 or more years and are age 65 or younger were counted. Counts are based on weighted sample. The sampling framework for the Survey of Doctorate Recipients was significantly restructured in 1991 and 1993, reducing comparability for the periods before and after the changes. Two weighting definitions were used for 1991: one that more accurately relates to the pre-1993 sampling framework and the other that more accurately relates to the 1993 onward sampling framework. Counts for 1991 were then calculated as the mean of the counts based on the two different weights to smooth the trend between the pre-and post-1993 periods. by comparing the percentage of Ph.D.s who reported working in industry 4 years after completing their Ph.D. to the percentage with definite plans to work in industry at the time they received their Ph.D. 13 Such a comparison shows that, although there is variation by field, about 3 times as many doctorates end up working in industry than do those who specify a firm initially. Despite these limitations, much can be learned from analyzing the SED firm placement data. Analysis shows that, from 1997 to 1999, 17,382 Ph.D.s in S&E planned to work in industry; 10,932 recipients identified a specific firm. 14 Table 1 presents a summary of our findings, showing (a) the percentage of all new Ph.D.s in a field who identified a firm and (b) the percentage of all those specifying a firm who identified a top 200 R&D firm or its subsidiary. 15 As indicated in Table 1, 14.5% of the new Ph.D.s in science and engineering during this period identified a specific firm. Approximately 40% of these were going to a top 200 R&D firm or subsidiary. The fields with the highest initial industrial placement were engineering and computer science, followed by chemistry. 16 The field with the lowest percentage going to industry was biology. This is not surprising, given the extraordinarily high prevalence of academic postdoctoral positions in the life sciences and the relatively small percentage of seasoned biologists working in industry. Among those headed to industry, computer scientists were the most likely to work at a top 200 R&D firm or subsidiary, followed closely by chemists and engineers. Those with doctorates in agriculture were least likely to go to a top 200 firm among the specific S&E fields. Table 2 examines the field of training of scientists and engineers hired and the R&D status of hiring firms. Firms are divided into the following five categories: top 20 R&D firms; top 21 to 50; top 51 to 200; other, which includes firms that engage in little or no R&D; and all. Across the board, engineers make up the largest proportion of industrial S&E hires. This is partly an artifact of the  , 1973-1999. NOTE: Only those who have held a doctorate for 5 or more years and are age 65 or younger were counted. Counts are based on weighted sample. The sampling framework for the Survey of Doctorate Recipients was significantly restructured in 1991 and 1993, reducing comparability for the periods before and after the changes. Two weighting definitions were used for 1991: one that more accurately relates to the pre-1993 sampling framework and the other that more accurately relates to the 1993 onward sampling framework. Counts for 1991 were then calculated as the mean of the counts based on the two different weights to smooth the trend between the pre-and post-1993 periods. data, reflecting the exclusion of individuals who take postdoctoral appointments in academe before going to industry. But it is consistent with the fact that engineers make up the largest percentage of all seasoned S&E Ph.D. recipients working in industry. 17 Differences in mix of hires exist based on firms' R&D classifications, and a chi-square test that the distributions are the same can be rejected at the .01 level of significance. For example, we see that, compared to the top 200 R&D firms, firms in the category other are more likely to hire from the fields of agriculture, biology, and medicine. This reflects the role that small firms play in these fields, especially in biotechnology. By way of contrast, top 200 R&D firms hire a greater proportion of engineers than do other firms. We also see that the top R&D firms are more likely to hire computer scientists than are lower rated firms, and this computer science intensity is even more concentrated among the top 20. The high intensity of computer science hires reflects in part the importance and size of companies doing research that is computer related. To wit, 48 firms (24%) of the top 200 are computer related.  Ph.D. placements by field are given in Table 3 for the top 30 hiring firms, grouped by industrial classification. 18 Together, these 30 firms hire 26% of all new Ph.D.s going to industry during the period studied and 68% of those working at a top 200 firm. Among the top 30, firms making the largest number of hires were in industrial machinery, equipment including computers and computer storage devices (Standard Industrial Classification [SIC] 35), communications equipment and semiconductors (SIC 36); computer programming, data processing, and prepackaged software (SIC 737); other; chemicals, including pharmaceuticals (SIC 28); aircraft, including engines and parts, and space equipment (SIC 372, 376); and motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts (SIC 371). The top 30 are interesting on several counts. First, although we do not have earlier years to use as benchmarks, we suspect that the pattern reflects the dominance of information technology (IT) during the late 1990s. Moreover, the dominance of firms in these fields clearly affected the rate at which engineers and computer scientists were being hired by industry. The table also shows that pharmaceuticals and other chemical companies were actively hiring new Ph.D.s, especially in the fields of chemistry, math, and biology. When pharmaceuticals are examined by themselves, we find that 15% of the pharmaceutical hires were trained in math, undoubtedly reflecting the importance of modeling in drug discovery. Also worth noting is that, although most industries hire disproportionately from one or two fields, almost all hire from four or more fields. Furthermore, when we display the data at the firm level (not shown), we find the distinction to be even finer, with almost all top 30 firms hiring from five or more fields. We investigated the degree to which the Ph.D. hire rate proxies the firm R&D expenditure rate by comparing the two rankings. Not surprisingly, the two overlap. For example, 6 of the top 10 hiring firms rank in the top 10 in terms of R&D expenditure, and 20 of the top 30 hiring firms are among the top 30 in terms of expenditures. 19 Clearly the Ph.D. hiring variable is related to the R&D expenditure variable, but it also captures a somewhat different dimension of innovation. This is consistent with work done by Stephan (2002), demonstrating that human resource data can provide a means of analyzing innovative patterns embedded in firms outside traditional R&D labs."}, {"section_title": "THE ROLE OF GEOGRAPHY", "text": "Measures of innovation consistently show extreme geographic concentration. For example, Black (2003) reported patent counts to be highly skewed geographically and Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) awards to be even more highly skewed. Moreover, patents and SBIR awards are heavily concentrated in the Northeast and California. For example, approximately one third of all utility patents are issued in five cities. Four of the five are located in either California or the Northeast. (The five, in order of total counts, are New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Boston.) SBIR Phase II awards are even more heavily concentrated, with approximately half being awarded to firms in San Francisco, Boston, Los Angeles, the District of Columbia, and New York. A common explanation for the geographic concentration of innovation in a small number of coastal cities is that innovative activity flourishes in an environment in which external knowledge sources are present. And these sources are themselves geographically concentrated. For example, university R&D expenditures, a common measure of knowledge sources, are heavily concentrated in a handful of states, which, with the exception of Texas, are located in the extreme West or extreme East (California, New York, Texas, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, in descending order of total R&D expenditures). Taken together, expenditures in these five states constituted 37.9% of all university R&D expenditures in 1999 (National Science Board, 2002). The regional distribution of Ph.D. production is given in Table 4. 20 Three categories are presented: share of all S&E Ph.D.s produced, share of Ph.D.s produced who are hired by industry, and share hired by top 200 R&D firms. The largest proportion of S&E Ph.D.s is produced in the East North Central region, closely followed by the South Atlantic, Pacific, and the Middle Atlantic. Taken together, these regions produce approximately two thirds of all Ph.D.s in the United States.   The region with the lowest proportion is the East South Central. A fairly similar, although slightly more regionally concentrated, story emerges when we focus on Ph.D.s hired by industry. The same four regions dominate, led again by the East North Central. The distribution is even more concentrated when we look at the regional origins of those destined to work at top 200 R&D firms. Here we find that 22.2% were trained at an East North Central institution. By way of contrast, the East South Central not only trains the smallest share of Ph.D.s, but among those trained it has the lowest rate going to industry. A chi-square test shows that the hiring distribution differs from the training distribution at the .01 level of significance. Clearly, such patterns suggest that many states fail to capture the economic development advantages that come from training a skilled work force. This was confirmed when we queried the data and determined that 63.3% of those heading to industry leave their state of training (70.1% when we focused on those going to a top 200 R&D firm). Table 5 lists the top 25 producers of Ph.D.s hired by top 200 R&D firms, as well as by all firms. Ten institutions each sent 100 or more doctoral recipients to top 200 firms during the period studied; half of these are located in the Midwest. Nine of the top 25 institutions are located in the Midwest. Consistent with the above discussion, we see that the rate at which these Midwesterneducated Ph.D.s remained in their state of training is lower than the national average: 14.3%, compared to 29.9%. The results are similar when we focus on all firms, as opposed to top 200 R&D firms. Eight of the top 25 producing institutions are located in the Midwest. The stay rate for these eight institutions is 21.1%, compared to a stay rate across all institutions of 36.7%. Public knowledge sources are often measured in terms of university R&D expenditure data. Column 7 of Table 4 shows the distribution of these expenditures by region. A comparison of column 7 with column 3 indicates that public knowledge sources as measured by human resource flows to industry are concentrated in different geographic regions from those that university R&D expenditure data would suggest, and the differences are statistically significant. For example, the South Atlantic region produces about 12% of all Ph.D.s going to a top 200 R&D firm but accounts for close to 20% of all university R&D expenditures. By contrast, the East North Central region trains 22.2% of Ph.D.s destined for a top 200 firm but accounts for only 14.4% of university R&D expenditures. A chi-square test indicates that the hypothesis that the Ph.D. distribution is the same as the expenditure distribution can be rejected at the .01 level of significance. The regional distribution of Ph.D. hires by industry, regardless of R&D status (column 2), is also statistically different from the distribution of university R&D expenditures, again at the .01 level of significance. We conclude that the spatial distribution of knowledge sources embodied in newly minted talent is different from the distribution of knowledge sources stemming from university research, as measured by university R&D expenditures. Earlier work by Stephan (2002) made the case that R&D expenditure data fail to capture certain dimensions of innovation that can be better measured by human resource data. A comparison of the spatial distribution of new hires (columns 4 and 5) with the spatial distribution of R&D industrial expenditures (column 6) is consistent with this argument, showing that, regardless of whether one measures placement for all firms or only for top 200 R&D firms, the distributions are spatially (and We conclude that the spatial distribution of knowledge sources embodied in newly minted talent is different from the distribution of knowledge sources stemming from university research, as measured by university R&D expenditures.   (1997)(1998)(1999). NOTE: S = suppressed. At the request of Science Resources Statistics, National Science Foundation, counts were not reported if 6 or fewer or if a specific firm contributes half or more of the count in a cell. significantly) different. For example, the Middle-Atlantic region hires 23.5% of Ph.D.s going to top 200 R&D firms, but its regional share of industrial R&D expenditures is but 18%; likewise, the West South Central hires 11.9% of the new Ph.D.s but accounts for only 5.8% of all R&D expenditures. Although some of these differences are undoubtedly because of our inability to fully measure Ph.D. flows to industry, the differences are provocative and suggest that R&D expenditures alone fail to capture regional differences. Table 4 raises the question of the degree to which firms recruit from their own backyard or hire from outside their immediate area or state. We take a first look at that question here, examining in Table 6 the top 25 MSA destinations of new Ph.D.s hired by firms. 21 We restricted our analysis to those placements educated by the 110 universities that account for most of the academic research conducted in the United States. 22 We were able to determine location because SED respondents are requested to give the city and state of the firm. 23 This allowed us to examine the geographic distribution of the hires and the extent to which the placements were local, where local is defined as placement in the same MSA in which the Ph.D. was received. The data are striking on several counts. First, 66% of the placements educated at research universities went to one of the top 25 MSAs. 24 Second, there is incredible disparity in counts between the top-ranked MSA and all other MSAs, with San Jose employing 2.2 times more scientists and engineers than Boston, the second most popular destination. Third, and related, California has high prevalence in the counts. Six of the top 25 destinations are in California. Combined, these six MSAs capture approximately one third of those going to a top 25 MSA and slightly more than one fifth of those going to any MSA. Fourth, as in other measures of innovation, the coasts play a special role; approximately 60% of those headed to a top 25 MSA go to a coastal MSA. As suggested by Table 6, the proclivity of firms to hire local talent is not high. Indeed, approximately 75% of the top 25 MSA industrial hires from research universities were educated outside the MSA area where the firm is located. The minimal role that local institutions play in educating the local workforce suggests that local institutions play a smaller role in economic development than is often thought. There are several reasons for this, including, but not limited to, the insufficiency of local supply, 25 the desire to diversify the knowledge portfolio by hiring from a large number of institutions, and the establishment of traditional networks. There is also the fact that these outcomes represent the investment decisions of firms and individuals engaged in a job-search process. Although the initial contact between firm and scientist in that process may be facilitated by proximity, the investment nature of the decision means that alternatives outside the local area are likely to enter the choice set. Our findings are reminiscent of what Florida (1999) found when he conducted focus groups with knowledge workers: They (knowledge workers) want to work in progressive environments, frequent upscale shops and cafes, enjoy museums and fine arts and outdoor activities, send their children to superior schools, and run into people at all these places from other advanced research labs and cutting-edge companies in their neighborhoods. . . . What's more, young graduates know they will probably change employers as many as three times in ten years, and they will not move to an area where they do not feel there are enough quality employers to provide these opportunities. (p. 71) This is not to dismiss the role that local institutions play. For many MSAs, the local research university is the top supplier of Ph.D.s. Stanford University, for example, is the dominant supplier to San Jose, training 175 of the 862 hires trained at a top research university. The University of Minnesota trained 86 of the new hires in the Minneapolis-St. Paul MSA, the University of Texas at Austin trained 67 of the hires in the Austin MSA area, and the Georgia Institute of Technology trained 61 of the new Ph.D. hires in Atlanta. If we cast a larger net and look at those trained at research institutions within the state instead of those trained in the destination MSA, we see a somewhat different story with regard to geography, with slightly more than 40% being trained in the state or states in which the MSA lies. 26  striking are the cities of Anaheim, Atlanta, and Los Angeles, all hiring 60% or more of their new Ph.D.s from within the state. By way of contrast, five cities hired fewer than 25% of their new Ph.D.s from research institutions within the state. A first cut at the insufficiency-of-local-supply hypothesis is taken by examining the number of Ph.D.s trained locally at a top 110 program who were headed to industry and the percentage of them hired locally (Table 6, columns 6 and 7). We see that four cities (San Jose, Detroit, San Diego, and Phoenix) hire more than 50% of local trainees going to industry. In nine cities, local industry hires fewer than 30% of the locally trained Ph.D.s going to industry. 27 The situation is considerably different when we focus on other MSAs, as opposed to the top 25 MSAs. In these cities, firms hire but 12% of those trained at the local research university, instead of the 34% retained by the top 25 MSAs. The ability of top placement cities to retain locally trained talent likely reflects the fact that these top cities have other characteristics associated with economic development, such as the presence of a highly trained labor pool, that are often lacking in other cities. As Florida (1999) noted, Stanford did not turn the Silicon Valley area into a high-tech powerhouse on its own; regional actors built the local infrastructure this kind of economy needed. The same was true in Boston and, more recently, in Austin, Texas, where regional leaders undertook aggressive measures to create incubator facilities, venture capital, outdoor amenities, and the environmental quality that knowledge workers who participate in the new economy demand. (p. 72)"}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "Despite the role that Ph.D. placements play, both directly and indirectly, in fostering economic development, little work has been done to document and analyze these placements. This article takes a first step at rectifying this deficiency. Using SED (National Science Foundation, 1997-1999) data, we have been able to track the firm placement and MSA destination of S&E Ph.D.s in the late 1990s who specified a firm. Of particular interest are placements at top 200 R&D expenditure firms. Although the database has limitations, especially for fields where postdoctoral training positions are common, and covers a limited period, the results provide a first look at economic development lessons from tracking Ph.D. placements. The degree to which these lessons hold when the database is extended for a longer time remains to be seen. It also remains to be seen whether the lessons would hold if the analysis were extended to include firm placement of postdoctorates. The spatial distribution of the institutions where the industrial hires received their Ph.D. training is striking. Our work shows that knowledge sources, as measured by where new Ph.D.s going to industry received their training, are concentrated in different geographic centers from those that university R&D expenditure data would suggest, and the differences are statistically significant. Especially striking is the important role the Midwest plays, educating close to 30% of all S&E Ph.D.s who headed directly to a top 200 R&D firm and 26% of those headed to industry in general from 1997 to 1999 but contributing only 21% of university R&D expenditures during the same interval. The geography story does not end here. Comparing region of training with region of employment shows significant outflows from the Midwest and significant inflows to the Pacific and Northeast regions of the country. The geography story continues when we focus on the origins of new Ph.D.s going to the top 25 cities hiring Ph.D.s working at a firm. Our research shows that 75% were trained outside the MSA; 58% were trained outside the state. States often invest in higher education with the conviction that it stimulates local economic development. And certainly, research supports this conviction. Our work, however, casts doubt on the benefits states realize from one piece of this investment, the education of a doctoral scientific workforce, and suggests that states capture but a portion of the economic benefits resulting from a trained Ph.D. workforce. What we do not investigate here is why states are able and willing to educate Ph.D.s who leave after graduation. Is the knowledge and technology transfer produced while Our work, however, casts doubt on the benefits states realize from one piece of this investment, the education of a doctoral scientific workforce, and suggests that states capture but a portion of the economic benefits resulting from a trained Ph.D. workforce. students are in graduate school sufficient to justify the expenditure? Is the halo generated from having a top-rated program beneficial in attracting industry to the state? Is what we observe an indication of disequilibrium, which bleak budget prospects may hasten to adjust as state budgets for higher education are slashed? Groen and White (2001) noted that incentives of universities and states with regard to the retention of highly trained workers differ: States have an interest in using universities to attract and retain high-ability individuals because they pay higher taxes and contribute more to economic development. Universities have an interest in their graduates being successful, but little interest in where their students come from or where they go after graduation. (p. 24) In these terms, universities, and not states, are the winners when it comes to the placement of graduate students in industries. But this takes the parochial view. It is not accidental that the real winner is the nation. As Rosenberg and Nelson (1994) pointed out, university research with a local and practical focus waned after World War II when the federal government stepped up to the plate as the major funder of university research. The mobility of talent across state lines is consistent with the dominant role that the federal government plays in funding university research."}]
