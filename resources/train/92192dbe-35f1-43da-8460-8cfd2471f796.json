[{"section_title": "", "text": "In the United States, about 5 percent of all farms rely, to some extent, on fruit and tree nut production for a portion of their income (2007 Census of Agriculture). Of these farms, the ones depending on fruit and tree nut sales for at least half the value of their farm production are referred to in this report as specialized fruit and tree nut farms. These specialized farms serve as the focus of a sectorwide trend analysis of fruit and tree nut production expenses in the United States. Using annual data from USDA's Agricultural Resource and Management Survey (ARMS), this report investigates the major expense components of specialized fruit and tree nut farms in the United States from 1998 to 2006. Based on 3-year averages (1998-2000, 2001-03, and 2004-06), the analysis compares farm expenses by farm size and across regions. Due to sample size limitations, the regional groupings were adjusted from the four traditional geographic regions (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West) assigned by the U.S. Census Bureau (fi g. 1). The Northeast and the Midwest were combined into a single region (North) to gain statistical signifi cance, forming three major regions-North, South, and West. ARMS classifi es farms into four size groups based on the value of production: small (less than $40,000 in production value), medium ($40,000-$249,000 in production value), large ($250,000-$999,999 in production value), and very large ($1,000,000 or more in production value).

ARMS is the only national survey that provides information on a broad range of issues about agricultural resource use, production practices, farm costs and fi nancial conditions, and the economic well-being of America's farm households-all collected in a representative sample. In addition to indepth analysis of individual sectors, such as fruit and tree nuts, the survey also allows comparisons among various farm sectors (Livezey and Ali). The ARMS is an annual survey designed and conducted jointly by ERS and the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). More information about the ARMS can be found at www.ers.usda.gov/ Briefi ng/ARMS. Specialized fruit and tree nut farms make up the vast majority of all U.S. farms engaged in fruit and tree nut production and provide a major portion of total U.S. fruit and tree nut production. Of the average 76,498 farms that produced fruit and tree nuts between 2004 and 2006, 82 percent were specialized fruit and tree nut farms (table 1). These specialized farms rely heavily on their fruit and/or tree nut crops for their farm income, even though they may also be engaged in other forms of agricultural production. During 2004-06, more than 95 percent of the farm income for these specialized fruit and tree nut farms was generated from fruit and tree nut sales. According to data derived from ARMS, the average number of specialized fruit and tree nut farms in the United States in 2004-06 (average of 62,959) declined by 20 percent from 1998-2000 (app. tables 1 and 3). Farm numbers declined across all three regions-North, South, and West. Small farms continue to dominate, representing more than half the average number of specialized fruit and tree nut farms during 2004-06 (app. table 7). These small specialized fruit and tree nut farms, however, are also becoming fewer, having declined by 35 percent from (average of 52,984) 1998-2000 to 2004-06 (average of 34,315). On the other hand, the number of medium, large, and very large farms rose during the same period, with very large farms showing the biggest gain, increasing 51 percent to an average 2,602 farms (app. tables 5 and 7). The characteristics of these specialized fruit and tree nut farms over the last several years partially mirrors the general trend in U.S. fruit and tree nut farms reported in the census of agriculture. While the number of specialized fruit and tree nut farms declined between 1998-2000 and 2004-06, all U.S. farms growing tree fruit, vine fruit, berries, and tree nuts increased from 85,973 in 1997 to 112,690 in 2007. Farms with orchards increased 2 percent over the same period, while orchard acreage declined 6 percent to 5.04 million acres. Data from the 2007 Census of Agriculture also indicated that small, family operations continue to dominate all U.S. fruit and tree nut farms. These small farms, however, generate only about 5 percent of all fruit and tree nut sales. Most fruit and tree nut sales come from fruit and tree nut farms with at least $50,000 in sales, with over 60 percent of the total sales coming from the largest of these farms-those with at least $1 million in sales.

Specialized fruit and tree nut farms in the North generally had fewer acres per farm than either the U.S. average or that of the other two regions (app. table 3). Harvested fruit and tree nut acres per farm in the North averaged only about half the U.S. average, while those in the South and West were between 5 and 10 percent larger than all specialized fruit and tree nut farms. Fruit and tree nut crops account for a larger percentage of harvested acres on specialized fruit and tree nut farms in all regions (app. table 4). On a per farm basis, fruit and tree nut harvested acres among specialized fruit and tree nut farms in the North averaged about 30 acres during 2004-06, or about 76 percent of their total harvested acres (app. table 3). In the South and West, harvested fruit and tree nut acres averaged slightly over 60 acres each and accounted for 88-90 percent of total harvested area per farm. While the share of fruit and tree nut acres to total harvested acres per farm are almost similar to that for the South and West, the West contributes a much greater portion of the U.S. fruit and tree nut production value because of the high concentration of specialized fruit and tree nut farms in the region (fi g. 2). In 2004-06, specialized fruit and tree nut farms in the West accounted for 82 percent  of fruit and tree nut crop value, while those in the South accounted for 11 percent and those in the North for 7 percent.

Washington ranks second to California in fruit and tree nut production value, followed by Florida. Washington accounted for about 10 percent of U.S. fruit-and treenut-bearing acreage in 2007, half of which produced apples. Washington is the largest apple-producing State, harvesting more than half of the U.S. apple crop. Over 75 percent of Washington's apple production during 2005-07 went to the fresh market. In terms of value, the fresh market accounted for over 95 percent of the more than $1 billion in apple crop value in Washington during 2005-07.

Only about 4 percent of specialized fruit and tree nut farms between 2004 and 2006 were classifi ed as very large, but these very large farms provided 58 percent of the total production value of fruit and tree nuts. Small farms contributed just 3 percent of total fruit and tree nut production value. Between 2004 and 2006, medium and large farms made up a signifi cant share of specialized fruit and tree nut farms (30 percent and 11 percent, respectively).

Small farms also dominated specialized fruit and tree nut farm populations in each of the three major regions (North, South, and West) during 2004-06 (table 2). While small farm shares of specialized fruit and tree nut farms within regions were higher in the South (77 percent) and in the North (55 percent), the West still accounted for the largest number of small specialized fruit and tree nut farms during 2004-06.

These expenses tend to vary with acreage and output. On average, the annual variable cash expense across all specialized U.S. fruit and tree nut farms from 1998 to 2006 was $114,066 per farm, or 83 percent of each farm's average total cash expenses (app. table 4). Annual variable expenses per farm rose 52 percent between 1998-2000 and 2004-06, led by increased outlays for fuels and oils, seeds and plants, labor, and fertilizers and other agricultural chemicals (app. tables 1 and 3). Average cash outlays for fuels and oils per farm more than doubled from 1998-2000 to 2004-06, and expenses for seeds and plants rose more than 80 percent. Labor and chemical input cost increases were also substantial, rising 59 percent and 42 percent, respectively. In addition to variable cash expenses, specialized fruit and tree nut farms also incur fi xed cash expenses, such as real estate and property taxes, interest, insurance premiums, rent, and lease payments. Combined with average variable cash expenses, the total cash expense for these farms averaged $170,342 per farm during 2004-06 (app. table 3). In comparison, nonspecialized fruit and tree nut farms incurred 56 percent higher average total cash expenses per farm during the same period because of the larger harvested crop acreage required to operate these farms (table 1). Acreage in fruit and tree nut production, however, amounted to 12 percent of total harvested acres per farm for these nonspecialized farms compared with 88 percent for the specialized farms.

Labor's share of total cash outlays per farm rose with farm size-29 percent for small specialized fruit and nut farms, 33 percent for medium farms, and 42-44 percent for large and very large farms. Throughout the fruit and tree nut production cycle, farm labor is required to carry out the various fi eld/orchard operations that, for most fruit and tree nuts, include grafting, transplanting (in the case of strawberries), thinning, pruning, irrigating, pest management, fertilization, and harvesting. Some farms also have onsite packing facilities, so some manual labor is also required to sort, pack, and grade fruit and nuts immediately after harvesting. With continued production demand in the U.S. fruit and tree nut industry, the industry often experiences shortages of agricultural labor. While mechanization may often be regarded as one option to Specialized Fruit and Tree Nut Farm Expenses relieve some of the demands for farm labor, it has not been widely adopted in the U.S. fruit and tree nut industry. The fresh market is a very important niche for U.S. fruit growers. While about a third of all the fruit produced in the United States enters the fresh market, it represents more than half the value of U.S. fruit production. When selling to the fresh market, fruit growers must comply with stringent quality requirements, making these crops more costly to produce. For example, skilled hired labor, especially in harvesting and packing, is necessary to avoid the risk of fruit damage and to ensure that specifi c criteria for appearance are met to maintain or increase customer base. For those reasons, most freshmarket fruit are harvested by hand. Generally, fruit are sorted and graded and those that do not meet freshmarket quality standards move to the processing sector. In some cases, however, like for cranberries, clingstone peaches, wine-type or raisin-type grapes, and most Florida citrus, the processing sector serves as the primary market. Quality requirements for fruit sold to processors are not as stringent as those for the fresh market; even so, most fruit is still harvested by hand. On the other hand, mechanical harvesting systems are used extensively for tree nuts, which are generally processed. Because many fruit and tree nut harvest seasons overlap, access to a reliable and affordable labor pool is vital to the U.S. fruit and tree nut industry. Based on 2007 Census of Agriculture data, fruit and tree nut farms employed 23 percent of all the hired farmworkers in the United States and accounted for 16 percent of total wages for hired farm labor.

Total cash expenses were consistently lowest for specialized fruit and tree nut farms in the North during each of the three periods, likely because of smaller harvested acreage devoted to fruit and tree nuts in the region and smaller farm size, on average. On a per acre basis, however, total specialized fruit and tree nut farm cash expenses were lowest in the South during both 1998-2000 and 2004-06. Total cash expenses in the South are spread across a larger average area per farm than in the North and West, driving down the region's per acre cost.

More than half of these expenses consisted of fertilizer and other agricultural chemicals, such as pesticides, insecticides, and herbicides. Cost increases, however, were highest for fuels and oils, with the average cost per farm more than two times higher. Much higher farm expenditure gains for fuels and oils are largely an offshoot of higher unit costs for petroleum-based fuels, such as diesel and gasoline, as refl ected by a 103-percentage-point increase in the average index of prices paid by farmers for fuels between 1998-2000and 2004-06 (USDA, NASS, Agricultural Prices Summary, 2005and 2007.

Cash outlays for all agricultural chemicals also increased by 42 percent, and utility expenses rose by 21 percent. Comparing expenses across the four farm size classes, chemical input expenses as a share of total cash costs per farm were relatively consistent for medium, large, and very large farms at 13 percent during 2004-06 (app . table  7). The share for small farms (those with less than $40,000 in production value) was slightly lower, at 10 percent. On a per farm basis, however, small specialized fruit and tree nut farms experienced a 5-percent increase in their average cash outlays for agricultural chemicals from 1998-2000 to 2004-06, while those for medium, large, and very large farms declined (table 3). As with most of the U.S. agricultural sector, higher prices for oil and natural gas over the past few years have translated to higher costs to fruit and tree nut growers for manufactured inputs. For instance, because natural gas is used to convert atmospheric nitrogen to synthetic fertilizer, the higher natural gas prices in recent years, coinciding with increased global demand for fertilizer, have driven up nitrogen fertilizer prices in the United States. Except for the small but growing organic fruit and nut production sector in the country, U.S. fruit and tree nut growers, along with vegetable growers, are some of the heaviest users of agricultural chemical inputs in farm production. With declining overall fruit and tree nut bearing acreage over the years, grower practices, such as the adoption of improved varieties, soil fertilization, pest management, and orchard-fl oor management, have contributed to higher yields and achieving the quality attributes that today's consumers demand. Specialized fruit and tree nut farms in the West had 25 percent higher manufactured input expenses per farm during 2004-06 than the national average (app. table 3). Of these specialized farms, 92 percent produce only one commodity. Sixty percent of all specialized fruit and tree nut farms are located in the West, including most of the large and very large specialized U.S. fruit and tree nut farms (over 80 percent each class). Specialized fruit and tree nut farms in the North and South are much more diversifi ed, wherby nearly a quarter of the farms in each of these regions produces more than one agricultural commodity, including livestock that requires no direct use of fertilizer and herbicides. Other farms that grow more than one crop could be growing nonfruit/nut crops, such as cover and forage crops, that would also not require intensive use of fertilizers and other chemical inputs."}, {"section_title": "Fixed Cash Expenses Rise", "text": "Farms also incur fi xed cash expenses, such as real estate and property taxes, interest payments, insurance premiums, and rent and lease payments. On a per farm basis for specialty fruit and tree nut farms, fi xed cash expenses contributed to 15 percent of their total cash outlays during 2004-06.

Fixed cash outlays rose for all expenditure items except for interest payments, which declined 6 percent. The national average trend for fi xed cash outlays of specialized fruit and tree nut farms, however, does not depict the trend seen across the different farm size classes and across regions. Average fi xed cash outlays rose only among small farms from 1998-2000 to 2004-06 and for large farms from 2001-03 to 2004-06. On a regional scale, average fi xed cash outlays over the period 1998-2000 to 2004-06 rose 24 percent in the West and 54 percent in the North, but fell 3 percent in the South. Interest payments represent the largest fi xed cash expenditure item for specialized fruit and tree nut farms. Interest expenses cover the cost of carrying both real estate and nonreal estate debt. Averaging $8,991 per farm during 2004-06, interest payments for specialty fruit and tree nut farms amounted to about 5 percent of total cash expenses for these farms and were higher than the average interest expenses incurred by all U.S. farms and ranches ($4,654 per farm). Similar to the vegetable and melon industry, much of the U.S. fruit and tree nut industry is concentrated in urban fringe and coastal areas, which raises land rent and interest on real estate debt. Interest expenses for specialized fruit and tree nut farms generally decline as farm size increases, with 8 percent of small farm cash expenses consisting of interest payments versus 4 percent for very large farms. This discrepancy suggests that large farms may have the capacity to self-fi nance some portion, if not all, of their operations."}, {"section_title": "Financial Viability of Specialized Fruit and Tree Nut Farms", "text": "Two fi nancial measures were applied during this analysis to see how well specialized fruit and tree nut farms in the United States control their production expenses for the immediate and long-term future. A farm may be fi nancially viable in the short run, such as for a year, if it is able to cover its variable expenses, or it may survive for more than a year if its revenues can cover total cash expenses. Some options for farms would be to tap cash reserves, borrow against assets, or use off-farm income to pay their total cash outlays. In the long run, however, a farm may be deemed fi nancially viable only when it is able to cover economic costs-that is total cash expenses plus an allowance for depreciation and imputed returns to management, land, and operator and unpaid labor. One of the indicators used to measure the fi nancial strength of specialized U.S. fruit and tree nut farms is the cash expense ratio. This ratio measures how much a farm operation must spend for production inputs and overhead items for each dollar of income it produces. Cash expense ratio is calculated by dividing total cash expenses by gross cash farm income. Based on this measure, specialized fruit and tree nut farms were found to be fi nancially secure in the short run, spending $76 on inputs and overhead items for every $100 of income produced during 2004-06. The cash expense ratio for specialized fruit and tree nut farms is the same as what was spent by nonspecialized fruit and tree nut farms ($77), as reported by 2004-06 ARMS data, and by all U.S. farms and ranches ($77) (http://www.ers.usda.gov/Briefi ng/ARMS/). Figure 5 shows the amount spent on production inputs and overhead items for every $100 that a farm earns differs very little between very large farms ($74), large farms ($72), and medium farms ($75). By contrast, small farms spent more than they earned, incurring $113 in cash expenses for every $100 of income, which suggests that small specialized fruit and tree nut farms are subsidized by off-farm income. Specialized fruit and tree nut farms in the South are the most heavily represented by small farms (77 percent of farms in the region), which may explain why the region had the highest cash expense ratio across regions. The second measure of fi nancial viability is the economic cost ratio, which measures how much a farm must spend over the long run for all costs (cash, noncash, and imputed expenses). This ratio is calculated by dividing total economic costs by gross farm income. Using this ratio, the analysis showed that specialized fruit and tree nut farms in the United States incurred $87 in total economic costs for every $100 of income they earned during 2004-06. The economic cost ratio was 3 percent lower than what was estimated for nonspecialized fruit and tree nut farms ($90) and 11 percent below those for all U.S. farms and ranches ($98), based on 2004-06 ARMS data. It is, however, very close to the economic cost ratio for specialized vegetable and melon farms, which was estimated at $88 for every $100 of gross farm income (Ali and Lucier, 2008). Small specialized fruit and tree nut farms were the most vulnerable to longrun unprofi tability. Based on the economic cost ratio calculations across farm size classifi cations, small farms were the only class producing income that was not suffi cient to cover total economic costs-spending $120 in the long run for every $100 of income. Specialized fruit and tree nut farms in the West-the region with the highest concentra-tion of large and very large farms-had the lowest economic cost ratio (fi g. 6). The highest economic cost ratio was in the North and, although the region had fewer small farms than in the South, it had the least representation by large and very large specialized fruit and tree nut farms. Currently, several issues could affect which fruit and tree nut crops are produced and which production methods are used. These issues include immigration, labor, environmental concerns (particularly those relating to agricultural chemical use and climate change), and diet and health. As a consequence of these concerns, modifi cations in farming operations could change the production expense profi le of specialized fruit and tree nut farms. For example, if the labor available to fruit and tree nut growers were further constrained, fresh-market production of some crops might be reduced, some production might shift to processing, or there could be more incentive to move toward mechanization. Adopting any of these changes could reduce overall labor requirements. Labor is the leading expense item for fruit and tree nut growers and is most intensively used in fresh-market production. New research may show an interest in advancing mechanization technology for specialty crops through the Specialty Crop Research Initiative, established in the 2008 Farm Bill. If mechanization becomes more prevalent in fruit and tree nut production, not just in harvesting, but also in the performance of other orchard or vineyard tasks, some of labor's share of production expenses would be shifted to fuel costs, and capital expenditures would increase. Should environmental regulations force reductions in use of chemical fertilizers and pesticide, there likely will be more widespread adoption of organic farming methods or increased use of integrated pest management systems to control weeds, prevent disease spread, and enhance soil nutrients. Both of these shifts in production methods will also alter the share of chemical inputs in the expense mix. Horticultural crops, such as fruit, are more sensitive to climate change than are grains and oilseeds (Backlund, Janetos, and Schimel, 2008). Geographic shifts in production resulting from poor crop adaptation to warming/drying climates pose a threat to growers. Another risk associated with climate change is reduced water supplies from mountain snowpack and premature snowmelt runoff, specifi cally in the western United States where most fruit and tree nuts are produced. Should these conditions occur more often and in combination with environmental regulations that restrict water use, growers will face higher crop irrigation costs and/or be forced to reduce orchard acreage. Growing concern about the obesity problem in our country has strengthened the emphasis on increasing public awareness of the benefi ts of following a healthy diet. If consumers were to strictly abide by nutritional recommendations that encourage fi ve to nine servings of fruit and vegetables per day, the United States would need to expand production and/or increase imports. For the fruit and tree nut sector, increased productivity may be achieved through acreage expansion, high-density plantings, and/or use of new varieties that offer better yield performance or adaptability to certain geographic and/or climatic conditions. A move toward increased acreage could further boost land costs, while higher density planting refl ects higher fi xed capital costs because, unlike annual crops, tree fruits, nut trees, and vineyards remain productive for a number of years."}, {"section_title": "What Could Alter Future Agricultural Production Expense Profi les?", "text": "Specialized fruit and tree nut farms-those who rely on fruit and tree nut sales for at least half the value of their farm production-comprise a vast majority of all the farms producing these crops in the United States. Because of fruit and tree nut farms' heavy dependence on labor and energy-based inputs to produce their crops, these specialized farms face growing pressure from rising production costs, primarily associated with recent labor shortages and rising fuel prices. Between 1998-2000 and 2004-06, before the current national and global economic crisis, average cash outlays for fuels and oils per farm more than doubled, while cost increases for labor and chemical inputs rose by 59 and 42 percent, respectively. Despite steep increases in input costs, however, specialized U.S. fruit and tree nut farms were able to remain fi nancially viable, more so than all U.S. farms and ranches, in general. This is especially true for the larger specialized fruit and tree nut farms (those with $40,000 or higher in production value like medium, large, and very large farms) that have a greater presence in the West. While there is no clear indication as to when the economic situation will turn around, market fl uctuations on a complex mix of economic (e.g., fuel prices, housing market, value of the U.S. dollar, commodity prices) and natural (weather) factors will continue to challenge fruit and tree nut growers, likely inducing structural and technological changes in their business approaches that will help them maintain their competitive position. Fuel prices have begun to climb again after dropping from the record highs this past summer, and, when the economic situation improves, a rebound in the housing market will bring growth again in construction jobs, likely pulling workers back to construction and away from agriculture. Access to farm credit may be a challenge due to current uncertainties in the credit market. Export growth has been instrumental in the success of the U.S. fruit and tree nut industry over the last several years, providing a key market outlet for growers and boosting grower prices. With other world economies also softening, demand for U.S. exports may be dampened by the current strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Low demand from exports could divert products to the domestic market and, with current consumer confi dence down, may also mean lower commodity prices paid to growers, increasing the fi nancial challenges faced by specialized fruit and tree nut farms. More than half of these specialized farms are small operations-found to be most vulnerable to shortrun and longrun fi nancial losses. One may note, however, that the business of growing fruit and tree nut crops is quite different from that of most other agricultural crops. Because fruit and tree nut orchards, along with vineyards, remain commercially productive for many years, production decisions are more likely based not just on 1 year's fi nancial performance, but on expectations over several years. Fruit and tree nut growers are, therefore, more likely to weather short-term economic hardships by tapping into potential profi tability associated with increasing fruit and tree nut demand."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Cash expenses: variable cash expenses plus fi xed cash expenses. Cash-expense ratio: measures how much a farm operation must spend for inputs and overhead items for each dollar of income it produces. Ratio = (Total cash expenses / Gross cash farm income)*100. Economic cost ratio: measures how much a farm operation must spend over the long run for all cost items (cash, noncash, and imputed expense). Ratio = (Total economic (long-term) expenses / Gross farm income)*100. Economic (long-term) expenses: cash expenses plus noncash and imputed expenses, such as depreciation, cash labor benefi ts, charges to operators and other unpaid labor, and charges to management. Farm size: based on the value of production from all commodities produced on a farm. Small farms (production value less than $40,000), medium farms ($40,000-$249,999), large farms ($250,000-$999,999), and very large farms ($1,000,000 or more). Fixed cash expenses: expenses that do not vary directly with output, but remain constant. Examples include real estate and property taxes, interest, insurance payments, mortgage, rent, and lease payments. Gross cash farm income: income from livestock, crops (including net Commodity Credit Corporation loans), Government payments (including commodity marketing loan gains and certifi cate-exchange gains), custom work and machine hire, fee income from crops and livestock removed under production contracts, land rental fees, and other farm-related income. Gross farm income: gross cash income plus net change in value of crop, livestock, feed, fertilizer inventory, and accounts receivable, value of farm products consumed or used on-farm, and gross imputed rental value of farm operator dwelling. Imputed expenses: charges for unpaid labor and management. Examples include work done by the farm operator, partners, and family members in conjunction with the production of commodities where there is no payment for services. Though unpaid labor does not generally receive a wage, it does have an economic cost. Compensation for unpaid labor and management is based on the opportunity cost of off-farm work or the return available in the next best alternative use of laborers' and managers' time and skills. Noncash expenses: may include charges on depreciable assets and noncash benefi ts provided to labor, such as housing. Depreciation is the charge sufficient to maintain production capacity of machinery, equipment, buildings, and purchased breeding livestock. Depreciation may be regarded as a discretionary expense in any particular year. It may be deferred when income is low, but ultimately must be paid to maintain the capital stock so that over the long term, the operation remains in business."}, {"section_title": "Glossary", "text": "Nonspecialized fruit and tree nut farms: farms where fruit and tree nuts account for less than 50 percent of total farm production value.
