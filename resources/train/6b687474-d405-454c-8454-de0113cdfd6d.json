Despite consistent observations supporting the role of vascular factors in AD [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] , they have not been incorporated into the prevailing pathogenic models nor into newly implemented research criteria for AD and its antecedent conditions [6] [7] [8] . It is unclear whether cerebrovascular disease represents an independent pathologic factor that confers additive risk for clinical severity and course, whether it is a result of AD pathology, and/or whether it plays a primary role by promoting AD-related neurodegenerative changes. Understanding the role of cerebrovascular disease in AD is especially critical as it could clarify the prospect of vascular risk reduction as a preventive strategy for AD.\nSmall-vessel cerebrovascular disease typically manifests as white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), areas of increased signal on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition to being present in most individuals by the mid 60s [9] and correlating reliably with cognitive functioning in normal aging [10] , we and others have shown that WMH may play a specialized role in AD.

Furthermore, WMH distributed in the parietal lobes, in particular, increase risk for later development of AD [14] , progress more rapidly among individuals who develop AD [15] , and are associated with genetic risk for AD [16] ; although there is also evidence that WMH distributed in anterior regions is associated with cognitive impairment and markers of AD pathology [17] [18] [19] . The purpose of the present study was to examine whether WMH, as a marker of small-vessel cerebrovascular disease, confers risk for regional brain atrophy reflective of AD-related neurodegeneration independently or interactively with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of tau pathology in individuals with MCI. We also examined whether WMH predict change in diagnostic status and longitudinal increase in CSF tau. Based on our previous observations with parietal lobe WMH and a recent report that showed that parietal WMH and tau have synergistic effects on predicting progression from MCI to AD [20] , we hypothesized that parietal lobe WMH in particular would modify the effect of tau pathology on brain atrophy and clinical decline among individuals at risk for AD."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Overview", "text": "Using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we examined whether regional WMH volumes are related to the biological or clinical markers implicated in current hypothetical pathogenic models of AD [21, 22] . Our primary question was whether regional WMH confers independent or synergistc effects on neurodegeneration with regard to tau pathology. Secondary questions addressed whether WMH has a similar effect on progression from MCI to AD and whether baseline measures of WMH predict increase in CSF tau over time. For markers of neurodegeneration, we chose entorhinal cortex volume as the main outcome because of its wellestablished role as a structural biomarker, important for memory function and vulnerable to neurofibrillary tangle pathology early in the pathogenic process of AD [23] . We examined progression from MCI to AD status as the primary clinical outcome. Finally, we examined the possibility that WMH promotes the progression of AD pathology by testing whether regional WMH volumes predict subsequent changes in tau pathology.

The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychologic assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD.

This method takes into account that fact that each subject has multiple visits and that measurements over time are likely to be correlated; furthermore, GEE allows for missing values and violation of normality [36] . Separate GEE models were run for each baseline regional WMH volume, time (in months from baseline), and their interaction as predictors (model 1). Cerebrospinal fluid-derived measures of t-tau at baseline, time, and their interaction were entered as predictors in model 2. A third series of models tested the two-and three-way interactions of baseline regional WMH volumes, baseline t-tau, and time controlling for the main effects of each predictor (model 3). Significant interaction terms with time would indicate that regional WMH volume or t-tau predicts the rate of entorhinal cortex atrophy. A significant three-way interaction would suggest that t-tau levels predict rates of atrophy and that this effect is modified by regional WMH burden, or equivalently that regional WMH volumes predict the rates of atrophy and that this effect is modified by t-tau levels. We included in a separate model CSF Ab 42 as an additional covariate to test if it had any confounding and/or modifying effects on the interaction between WMH volumes and t-tau (model 3b). Similarly, this analysis was repeated after restricting the subject group to individuals defined as \"amyloid positive\" (n 5 124) by cut points established in ADNI [34] .

For graphical purposes ( Fig. 1) , we dichotomized subjects in high and low baseline parietal lobe WMH volumes and plotted rates of entorhinal cortex atrophy, stratifying by baseline t-tau level. The results did not change when Ab 42 was introduced as an additional covariate (Table 2, model 3b); similarly, when restricting the analyses to individuals defined as amyloid positive, the t-tau ! parietal WMH ! time interaction, the effect was almost identical (b 5 21.29, CI 5 3.00-0.43)."}, {"section_title": "Progression to clinical AD", "text": "Among regional WMH volumes, only baseline parietal WMH volume predicted conversion to AD at a trend level (HR 5 1.07, CI 5 0.99-1.16; P 5 .077).

For example, the significant interaction between tau and time (model 2) indicates that entorhinal cortex volume declines on average 5.14 mm 3 per month less in the low tau group compared with the high tau group (reference).

Several important findings were observed. As expected, greater tau predicted greater rate of entorhinal cortex atrophy, but this association was modified by WMH burden; participants with lower levels of tau pathology had a higher rate of atrophy if they also had increased WMH burden.\nConsistent with current pathogenic models of AD [21, 22] , increased tau burden is clearly a primary source of neurodegeneration, but when tau levels are low, regionally distributed WMH burden has an important impact on neurodegeneration. However, elevated WMH, particularly in the parietal lobes, also predicted progression from MCI to AD, and this association was particularly strong among individuals with high levels of tau; those with both high tau and high parietal lobe WMH were at particularly high risk of conversion to AD. Taken together, the findings suggest that regionally distributed WMH influence AD in two ways: first, by promoting neurodegenerative changes directly and second, by potentiating the effect of tau on clinical conversion (Fig. 4 ). Two notable observations in this study help explain the nature of the interaction between tau pathology and WMH. First, we showed that WMH volume predicts the increase in CSF tau over time, but tau levels do not predict the accumulation of WMH over time. Second, careful examination of the interaction between tau levels and parietal lobe WMH volumes on progression of entorhinal cortex atrophy, displayed in Fig. 1 , suggests a biological ordering where the effect of WMH on entorhinal cortex atrophy precedes the effect of tau on entorhinal cortex atrophy. That is, among individuals with lower levels of tau, only those with higher amounts of parietal lobe WMH have reliable decline in entorhinal cortex volume. On the other hand, among those with high levels of tau, both those with high and low parietal WMH volumes show a similarly precipitous decline in entorhinal cortex volume; in addition, baseline entorhinal cortex volumes among individuals with high parietal WMH (i.e., the intercept in the lower panel of Fig. 1 ) are similar to the entorhinal cortex volumes observed at the last follow-up visit for individuals with low levels of tau (i.e., values at Compared with participants with low t-tau, those with high t-tau had a 25% increase in the risk of incident AD for every 1 cm 3 increase in parietal lobe WMH. High and low t-tau groups are defined by cut score of 93 mg/ mL, according to previous studies in ADNI [34] . High and low parietal lobe WMH groups are defined by the mean log parietal lobe WMH volume for graphical purposes only.

Abbreviations: CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; t-tau, total tau; WMH, white matter hyperintensity; CI, confidence interval. Fig. 1 ). We therefore speculate that accumulating parietal lobe WMH is a relatively early phenomenon that promotes neurodegeneration among individuals with MCI and that t-tau and WMH do not necessarily represent two independent sources of impairment that have additive impact, but rather are biologically linked. It should be noted that research on the ordering of the biological and clinical changes in AD are inherently biased by the measurement precision of relevant variables; it is possible that the measurement of WMH in ADNI, which was not designed to examine cerebrovascular disease, may be less precise than other biological markers."}, {"section_title": "36-month interval in the top panel of", "text": "Although we found that WMH volume distributed in several regions is important for clinical outcomes, elevated burden in the parietal lobes was most consistent. Our study is in line with a recent report [20] that showed that neurologically healthy older adults or patients diagnosed with MCI who progressed to AD over a 6-year interval were more likely to have high levels of parietal lobe WMH at baseline if their CSF-derived measures of tau were normal. Together with our previous reports that implicate parietal lobedistributed WMH in individuals at high genetic [16] and clinical [14, 15] risk for AD, findings from the present study provide further evidence of the importance of the regional distribution of WMH. The parietal lobes have been implicated in AD pathogenesis and clinical expression for quite some time [37, 38] . It is interesting to note that metabolic imaging studies classically point to parietal lobe hypometabolism in AD [39] , which is typically interpreted as evidence of dysfunction to neurodegenerative changes in that region. Future studies will need to determine the extent to which metabolic dysfunction in this region is mediated by underlying vascular damage. Furthermore, the propensity for WMH distributed in the parietal lobes to be associated with risk for AD may suggest that the pathology underlying WMH may vary by region. Indeed, in theory, any fluid-restricting pathologic change that causes local damage to the white matter can cause hyperintense signal on T2weighted MRI scans. We [40] have hypothesized that WMH in posterior regions reflects both small-vessel ischemic damage and microhemorrhagic damage due to cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Alternatively, the pathology underlying the regional distribution of WMH may be uniform, but its clinical impact may vary by region; posterior damage may impact cognitive and functional networks more so than damage to other areas.\nAlthough most pathogenic models of AD suggest that tau-related pathology results from Ab toxicity in AD, tau is a nonspecific marker that increases with damage to cells in the brain. When tau levels are elevated in the CSF, it is most likely because of accumulation within neurons and then release into the fluid with the degeneration of those brain cells [41] , although theoretically CSF tau levels may reflect degeneration, accumulation of the protein, or both. Neuropathologic studies are consistent in demonstrating that tissue damage that results in radiological WMH is likely driven by small-vessel ischemic change [42] . Common histologic features of WMH include arteriolosclerosis, increased myelin pallor, and complete or incomplete infarction [41] [42] [43] . It is therefore conceivable that some tau increases results from the ischemic damage reflected in WMH. This conclusion is indeed a major \"take home\" message of this study-small vessel cerebrovascular disease is one source of the neurodegenerative changes in AD. A previous study that used data from ADNI [44] showed that WMH volume predicted clinical and cognitive decline, but was not associated with CSF-derived Ab 42 or hippocampal volume. However, that study did not consider Fig. 4 . Conceptual model linking WMH to clinical progression in AD. Current pathogenic models of the disease emphasize the precipitating role of Ab, which leads to tau pathology, resulting in regional atrophy, cognitive decline, and conversion to dementia. Results from this study suggest that regional WMH affect tau directly (A), affect markers of disease progression (i.e., regional atrophy and clinical progression) directly (B), and modify the effect of tau on disease progression (C). Whether or how regional WMH and Ab interact needs to be elucidated (E). Abbreviations: WMH, white matter hyperintensity; AD, Alzheimer's disease.\nregional WMH volume nor examine its impact on tau levels or entorhinal cortex volume, which may be more specific markers for neurodegenerative changes in AD. In the context of the previous report, our study suggests that regional WMH volume may affect AD-related neurodegeneration if not amyloid pathology.\nThere are obvious clinical and theoretical implications for this work. From a clinical perspective, our findings indicate that interventions targeted at reducing the accumulation of WMH or treating their antecedent risk factors could reduce the risk of AD and the rate of neurodegenerative changes. Participants with severe vascular risk and cerebrovascular disease are excluded from participation in ADNI, which, on the one hand, suggests that the impact of WMH may be even greater in the overall population, which includes individuals with more severe cerebrovascular disease, but on the other hand, limits our ability to generalize our findings to individuals with more severe cerebrovascular disease. Results from a recent randomized controlled trial showed that interventions directed at the amelioration of cardiovascular risk factors were successful at slowing down white matter pathology progression in early AD, but had little effect on cognition [45] . Thus, we speculate that modification of vascular risk profile would have only little effect when clinical evidence of dementia has already emerged. Future intervention studies should focus on presymptomatic individuals at risk for AD.\nFrom a theoretical perspective, these findings challenge current hypothetical models of AD pathogenesis [22] and recently implemented diagnostic criteria [7, 8] . Cerebrovascular vascular disease is considered an important \"confound\" that may help explain variability in symptoms onset rather than playing a primary role in pathogenesis of disease. Our findings add to an accumulating body of work that implicates small-vessel disease as an important driver of disease with similar impact as tau pathology. Thus, although amyloid pathology may be necessary for AD but not sufficient to explain the phenomenology of the disease, small-vessel cerebrovascular disease, like tau, may represent a \"second hit\" that is required to produce the neurodegenerative changes and cognitive changes associated with AD.
