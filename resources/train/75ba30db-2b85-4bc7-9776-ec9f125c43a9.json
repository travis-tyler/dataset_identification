[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Geodetic Survey \u0351NGS\u0352 manages the National Continuously Operating Reference Station \u0351CORS\u0352 system that comprises a network of over 1,350 sites, each containing a geodetic quality Global Navigation Satellite System receiver. This network is currently growing at a rate of about 15 sites per month. NGS collects, processes, and distributes data from these sites in support of high-accuracy three-dimensional positioning activities throughout the United States, its territories, and a few foreign countries. CORS data are also used by geophysicists, meteorologists, atmospheric and ionospheric scientists, and others in support of a wide variety of applications. This paper addresses the history of the CORS network, some of its applications, and plans for enhancing it within the next few years.\n10.1061/\u0351ASCE\u03520733-9453\u03512008\u0352134:4\u035195\u0352 CE Database subject headings: Satellites; Geodetic surveys; History.\nThe history of the Continuously Operating Reference Stations \u0351CORS\u0352 system is intimately connected to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's \u0351NOAA's\u0352 National Geodetic Survey \u0351NGS\u0352 and this agency's mission to define, maintain, and provide access to the U.S. National Spatial Reference System \u0351NSRS\u0352.

Hence, in the late 1980s, this agency embarked on applying GPS instrumentation and field techniques to improve the NSRS. NGS quickly converted its traditional horizontal field operations \u0351which applied line-of-sight instruments\u0352 to three-dimensional \u03513D\u0352 field operations using GPS instrumentation. Snay \u03511989\u0352 reported that traditional line-of-sight techniques provided positional coordinates with relative accuracies of approximately 1:250,000 among the primary horizontal reference stations in the NSRS. GPS, on the other hand, easily yields relative accuracies exceeding 1:1,000,000. In addition, because of the line-of-sight requirement, many of the older reference stations had been installed in locations, like mountain tops, which are difficult to access.\nNGS first applied GPS to determine positional coordinates for the brass disks and other monuments that served as traditional reference stations. Starting with Tennessee in 1987, NGS collaborated with various state and federal agencies and others to establish a high accuracy reference network \u0351HARN\u0352-also called a high precision geodetic network-in each of the 50 states. For each HARN survey, many new reference marks were positioned so that, as compared to the preexisting reference marks, the new ones would be located in more accessible places \u0351e.g., near public roads\u0352 and/or they would provide a relatively less obstructed view of the sky.

Each CIGNET site was equipped with a highquality dual frequency GPS receiver that continuously recorded signals from GPS satellites. The primary intention was to make dependable tracking data available from a network of ground stations to compute precise ephemeredes \u0351orbits\u0352 for the GPS satellites. In 1989, CIGNET contained three stations in the United States \u0351MOJA in Mojave, Calif.; RICH in Richmond, Fla.; and WEST in Westford, Mass.\u0352. These early CORS were equipped with Mini-Mac 2816-AT dual-frequency codeless receivers \u0351Aero Service Division, Western Geophysical Company of America, Houston\u0352. In 1990, CIGNET expanded into the southern hemi-sphere. By the end of 1991, CIGNET comprised a total of 21 sites spanning all continents except Antarctica. As is now the case, all tracking data were collected by several partners and made freely available to GPS investigators through NGS archives \u0351Sche-newerk et al. 1990\u0352. Gradually, NGS augmented the CIGNET network, generating the core of the first public global GPS network that, unknowingly at the time, evolved into the current International Global Navigation Satellite System \u0351GNSS\u0352 Service \u0351IGS\u0352 network under the auspices of the International Association of Geodesy.\nThe concept of covering the entire United States with a network of CORS to enhance the NSRS was first postulated by Strange \u03511994\u0352. Soon after, Strange and Weston \u03511995\u0352 published a preliminary description of the CORS system. Around this same time, several other federal agencies were also starting to establish networks of continuously operating GPS base stations, but for different reasons. The U.S. Coast Guard \u0351USCG\u0352 wished to supplement its LORAN radionavigation service by offering the differential GPS \u0351DGPS\u0352 service to support safe marine navigation in U.S. coastal waters. Similarly, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \u0351USACE\u0352 sought a cost efficient navigation system to support their inland waterway operations \u0351dredging, hydrographic surveys, etc.\u0352. They collaborated with the USCG to extend the DGPS service inland along several of the major rivers. Finally, the Federal Aviation Administration \u0351FAA\u0352 wanted to use some type of CORS to support safe air navigation. The FAA developed their Wide Area Augmentation System \u0351WAAS\u0352. Other federal agencies like NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory \u0351JPL\u0352 and the U.S. Geological Survey were already heavily invested in using CORS sites to determine satellite orbits and study crustal motion. Because of the similarities between these projects, the U.S. General Accounting Office directed these agencies to work together and to coordinate activities and equipment procurements to reduce the expense to the federal government and the U.S. taxpayer. NGS found itself in an advisory role helping to define the GPS equipment specifications needed to support the missions of all these agencies \u0351Spofford and Weston 1998\u0352.\nSince the late 1980s, data from both CIGNET and JPL sites were used to support global GPS orbit computations \u0351Schutz et al. 1990\u0352. In 1994, NGS officially began building the CORS network by installing a GPS receiver on the campus of the National Institutes of Standards and Technology, formerly called the National Bureau of Standards, in Gaithersburg, Md. Six months later, NGS installed a GPS receiver near Boulder, Colo. and with time incorporated into the CORS network a number of continuously operating GPS fiducial stations that originally were part of CIGNET. Data from all these sites were made available via the Internet and, progressively, NGS added selected U.S. permanent GPS base stations to the CORS network.\nThe USCG and USACE began installing their DGPS sites and FAA their WAAS sites in 1995. NGS worked with these agencies to incorporate both the DGPS and WAAS sites into the CORS network. The initial phase of the USCG network was largely completed by January 1996, although more sites have since been added. Other federal, state, and locally sponsored continuously operating receivers were identified and gradually included into the CORS network from 1995 onwards. By 1995 NGS obtained access to more than 50 geodetic quality GPS receivers, most of them deployed by USCG and other participating agencies without the need by NGS to install, maintain, or operate any of the sites. The Texas Department of Transportation was the first state agency to join the CORS system with the inclusion of their ten-station Regional Reference Point network that provided significant coverage in Texas. By 1996 the number of CORS sites had increased to 85. By making contact with interested agencies and arranging to exchange data, NGS expanded the network to 108 sites by December 1997. The 200-site milestone was surpassed in 2000, and since then the CORS network has grown to its current size of approximately 1,350 sites, and it continues to grow in importance as the primary way for the geodetic-surveying community to access the NSRS. At present, the CORS network contains stations in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central and South America, the Caribbean, and Iraq. More than 200 organizations participate in the program. Recently some sites of EarthScope's Plate Boundary Observatory \u0351PBO\u0352, established in the western part of the North American continent to detect crustal motions, have been incorporated into the CORS network.\nAlthough the number of CORS sites is currently growing at a rate of about 15 sites per month, the total number of permanent GPS tracking stations in the United States is probably growing perhaps twice as fast. An ongoing project, that may take several years to complete, is to determine an accurate orthometric height for each CORS site. Determining the orthometric height of a CORS site may require special methodology \u0351Greenfeld and Sens 2003\u0352 depending on the location and the type of antenna mounting.\nThe latest international installation by NGS of a CORS antenna was done near Fortaleza, Brazil, where the local tie between the new and the old reference points was remeasured to about 1 mm accuracy. The receiver at this site is connected to an external atomic hydrogen-maser clock. According to Ray et al. \u03512007\u0352 , the performance of this clock is among the best of any H-maser station in the combined CORS-IGS network.\nThe National CORS system is rapidly becoming the preferred method for accurate 3D positioning in the United States and abroad. The advantage to GPS practitioners is that they only need to deploy one GPS receiver and download corresponding CORS data via the Internet to process these data in differential mode. The Web-based utility, UFCORS \u0351see the following\u0352, has made such downloads easy. As part of the CORS project, NGS is working with scientists around the world to develop digital models and techniques that will enable GPS users to determine accurate positions economically and in a timely manner. Fig. 1 shows the geographic distribution of CORS sites as of May 2008. The primary access for CORS information is via the Web \u0351\u0357http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/CORS/\u0358\u0352. See also the articles by Snay et al. \u03512002b\u0352 and Stone \u03512006\u0352.\nThe CORS network continues to evolve as we speak. It is expected to increase by \u03f3200 stations in 2008 due to the large number of organizations establishing real-time positioning networks and the project to build EarthScope's PBO for monitoring crustal motion. This rate of growth will result in a CORS network with average intersite distances on the order of 100 km in the contiguous United States. In light of this growth, NGS has recently updated its guidelines for establishing CORS sites \u0351NGS 2006\u0352, improved its tracking of metadata, upgraded its GPS analysis software \u0351called PAGES\u0352, and is planning a complete reanalysis of all IGS plus CORS data observed since 1994. The latter activity will be performed in collaboration with several other IGS Analysis Centers, and it is expected to be completed within the year 2010."}, {"section_title": "CORS and the Definition of the NSRS", "text": "NGS derived the original realization of the North American Datum of 1983 \u0351NAD 83\u0352 in 1986 by performing a rigorous ad-justment of most of the classical geodetic observations in its archives together with Doppler observations and a few very long baseline interferometry \u0351VLBI\u0352 baselines \u0351Schwarz 1989\u0352. This original realization is called NAD 83 \u03511986\u0352. With improvements in our knowledge of terrestrial reference frames, NGS has introduced several newer realizations of NAD 83, refining at each step the adopted coordinates. In 1998 NGS introduced the current realization, called NAD 83 \u0351CORS96\u0352, which is based on the CORS network by defining a transformation from the International Terrestrial Reference Frame of 1996 \u0351ITRF96\u0352 to NAD 83 \u0351Craymer et al. 2000\u0352. In both reference systems, ITRF and NAD 83 \u0351CORS96\u0352, the 3D positional coordinates of each CORS is complemented by a 3D velocity to account for crustal motion. A more recent ITRF realization is known as the ITRF2000. ITRF2000 coordinates and velocities may be transformed to corresponding NAD 83 \u0351CORS96\u0352 values using equations and parameters described by Soler and Snay \u03512004\u0352. It is important to note that CORS sites located in Hawaii and other Pacific islands have been used to define the NAD 83 \u0351PACP00\u0352 reference frame for points located on the Pacific tectonic plate. Similarly CORS sites located in Guam have been used to define the NAD83 \u0351MARP00\u0352 reference frame for points located on the Mariana tectonic plate. More information about the procedures used to define these two reference frames is available in Snay \u03512003\u0352. CORS sites have been also employed to establish accurate geodetic control in other countries such as Mexico \u0351Soler and Hern\u00e1ndez-Navarro 2006a\u0352 and Jamaica \u0351Newsome and Harvey 2003\u0352 When a CORS site first comes on line, NGS uses at least ten 24-h GPS data sets to compute this station's ITRF2000 positional coordinates relative to other stations in the global IGS network. Also, NGS uses the horizontal time-dependent positioning \u0351HTDP\u0352 software \u0351Snay 1999\u0352 to predict the station's ITRF2000 velocity. NGS then transforms the ITRF2000 positional coordinates and velocity for this CORS site into their corresponding NAD 83 \u0351CORS96\u0352 values via the adopted 14-parameter similarity transformation \u0351Soler and Snay 2004\u0352.\nEvery few years, NGS reprocesses all CORS data collected since 1994 to compute provisional positions and velocities for all CORS relative to the current ITRF realization: call it ITRFxx. If, for any station, these provisional ITRFxx positional coordinates differ from the currently adopted ITRFxx positional coordinates by more than 1 cm in the north-south or east-west component or by more than 2 cm in the vertical component, then NGS adopts the provisional position and velocity to supersede the previously adopted ITRFxx position and velocity.\nIn addition to this validation process, NGS performs a solution for each day to monitor the quality of adopted CORS positional coordinates. Each solution includes all CORS data collected during the 24-h period spanning that day. As a by-product, NGS compiles plots showing differences between the published ITRF2000 coordinates and the values obtained from the daily solutions, corrected for crustal motion, for the latest 60 days. The results are plotted relative to a local horizon \u0351north-east-up\u0352 coordinate frame and are made available to the general public through the CORS Web page \u0351ftp://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cors/Plots/ xxxx.pdf; where xxxx denotes the site's four-character identification\u0352. The movement or replacement of the antenna or an unexpected natural phenomenon may displace the position of the CORS reference point. Geophysical processes \u0351earthquakes, volcanic activity, etc.\u0352 may also produce significant station displacements that should be documented. This information is critical to CORS users if they want to use CORS data to determine accurate positional coordinates for points of interest to them. When the trend of the 60-day series of daily estimates differ from this station's adopted positional coordinates by more than the tolerances described in the preceding paragraph \u03511 cm horizontal; 2 cm vertical\u0352, then NGS carefully analyzes the available data to determine whether or not this station's published positional coordinates and velocities should be updated. Similar analysis is done with respect to the adopted NAD 83 \u0351CORS96\u0352 coordinates. When the daily provisional transformed coordinates referred to the NAD 83 frame differ by more than 2 cm in the north-south or east-west component or by more than 4 cm in the vertical component, then NGS adopts the provisional NAD 83 positional coordinates and velocity to supersede the previously adopted NAD 83 values. As a result of these less stringent tolerances, adopted NAD 83 \u0351CORS96\u0352 positional coordinates and velocities are less likely to be updated than their ITRF counterparts. However, this NGS policy, established in 1999 is currently being discussed at NGS for possible revision to lower tolerances in response to both internal and external requests.\nFor those agencies whose sites are included in the CORS network, NGS computes highly accurate 3D positional coordinates and velocities in the NSRS for their site antennas, provides an international data distribution mechanism, monitors the positions of the antennas on a daily basis, and notifies the agencies when movements of the antennas are detected. In exchange, the agencies notify NGS when they change equipment or software so that NGS can keep CORS users abreast of the status of the CORS sites. Scientific users who monitor very small movements of the Earth's crust are especially interested in any antenna changes so that they can account for those effects when they undertake long-term analyses of site locations. When antenna changes are detected and corrections made, NGS immediately publicizes this information through the CORS Newsletter \u0351http:// www.ngs.noaa.gov/CORS/newsletter1/\u0352.\nIn March 2001, efficient access to the NSRS through GPS was introduced with the release of the On-line Positioning User Service \u0351OPUS\u0352 utility. OPUS is an automatic service that requires the user to input only a minimal amount of information; its instructions are self-explanatory and its Web page contains enough details to be followed easily \u0351http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS/\u0352. However, OPUS has a few restrictions users should be aware of: first, and most importantly, OPUS provides a differential GPS static solution. Second, a minimum of 2 h of GPS observations are recommended to obtain surveying-geodetic accuracies \u0351Soler et al. 2006b\u0352. Third, a maximum of 48 h of GPS data is permitted \u0351the GPS data can cross midnight only once\u0352. Fourth, the submitted data file must contain dual-frequency \u0351L1/L2\u0352 carrier phase observables. Finally, GLONASS observations cannot be processed at this time, although in the future they will be accepted along with Galileo data, as the constellation of this European navigational system becomes available. Strictly based on Internet access, OPUS provides the geospatial community with positioning referred to both the ITRF2000 and the NAD 83 \u0351CORS96\u0352 reference frames. OPUS routinely achieves accuracies \u0351reported as \"peak-to-peak\" values\u0352 better than 2 cm in the horizontal dimensions and 5 cm in the vertical dimension by using corresponding data from three nearby CORS sites. Readers interested in knowing the statistical meaning of the peak-to-peak values reported by OPUS should read Schwarz \u03512006\u0352. More detailed information about OPUS may be obtained in a number of references, e.g., Mader et al. \u03512003\u0352; Stone \u03512006\u0352; Soler et al. \u03512006c\u0352; and Weston et al. \u03512007\u0352 . The infrastructure of OPUS is the GPS data and the fiducial control available from the CORS sites. The original idea of creating CORS to support GPS surveying activities reached a new level of efficiency with the introduction of OPUS. The geodetic, surveying, mapping, and GIS communities have embraced OPUS with great enthusiasm. The progress of this Internet-based utility has been nothing less than spectacular since its inception in 2001. Fig. 2 depicts OPUS usage by county during the 12-month period from May 2007 to April 2008. As Fig. 2 shows, during this period a total of 171,573 OPUS solutions were successfully processed. For completeness, it should be reported that during the same 1-year period OPUS processed a total of 23,502 data sets observed outside the United States. The number of OPUS users is expected to increase significantly now that NGS is broadening the functionality of OPUS. On January 31, 2007, the first variation of OPUS, called OPUS-RS \u0351rapid static\u0352, was declared \"initially\" operational. Like the original implementation of OPUS, OPUS-RS computes positions in differential mode for dual-frequency data collected by a GPS receiver. What's new about OPUS-RS is a new processing engine \u0351Schwarz 2008\u0352, allowing as little as 15 min of data, while \u0351gen-erally\u0352 maintaining the accuracy of the original OPUS. The user can send GPS data to OPUS-RS by accessing: http:// www.ngs.noaa.gov/OPUS/. For a brief introduction to OPUS-RS, see Martin \u03512007\u0352; Meade \u03512007\u0352. A practical example of how OPUS-RS can be applied to day-to-day work in surveying engineering is described in Lazio \u03512007\u0352. Another variation of OPUS will be OPUS-DB \u0351database\u0352 that will require a minimum of 4 h of observations but will give surveyors, geodetic engineers, and others the option of archiving the resulting positional coordinates in an NGS database for public accessibility. Finally, OPUSMapper is being developed to process L1 code data to determine positional coordinates accurate enough for mapping and GIS applications. Although each of these functionalities are being developed in phases, they will ultimately all be part of an integrated \"OPUS\" utility."}, {"section_title": "Data Archives", "text": "All CORS data are collected at two facilities, one located in Silver Spring, Md. and the other in Boulder, Colo. At each facility, the GPS data are organized into various types of formatted files \u0351RINEX, Hatanaka, etc.\u0352 for public distribution. People may freely access these data files and related metadata either via anonymous file transfer protocol \u0351ftp://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cors/\u0352 or via the World Wide Web \u0351http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/CORS/\u0352. In January 2000, NGS introduced a new interface to the CORS web site. This new interface is known as CORSAGE \u0351CORS Amiable Geographic Environment\u0352 because it enables people to access CORS data and metadata through a series of geographic maps. The CORS homepage itself features an index map in which the total area of CORS coverage has been partitioned into several color-coded regions, each usually involving a few states. On a regional map, a user can click his/her mouse on the map symbol representing a particular CORS site to obtain a window containing a local map that pinpoints this site's location relative to nearby population centers, major roads, and other geographic features. A menu appears to the left of the local map which enables users to view/download particular information about this site, for example, a file containing the site's positional coordinates and velocity. Another item on this menu enables users to view a calendar displaying-with 10-min resolution-the time span when CORS data are available for this site. Inspecting such calendars can save users from downloading and processing files that contain undesirable data gaps. Other menu items provide access to the site's GPS data and to files containing certain descriptive information about this site \u0351type of GPS equipment, responsible institution, contact person, history of receiver and antenna replacements, etc.\u0352 Access to CORS information using a geographic Google interface has recently been added."}, {"section_title": "UFCORS", "text": "In November 1998, NGS introduced the \"user-friendly\" CORS \u0351UFCORS\u0352 information server that enables users to request and receive GPS data and associated metadata \u0351satellite ephemeris and station-specific descriptive information\u0352 for stations in the CORS network via the World Wide Web. UFCORS provides a convenient alternative to both the anonymous FTP information server and the Web-based \"standard\" CORS information server for retrieving CORS information. UFCORS allows a user to select a comprehensive package of information for a particular station and a particular time interval. Anonymous FTP and the standard CORS information server provide the information only in the format that is stored at NGS, whereas UFCORS can repackage the information into any of several different formats. For example, with UFCORS a person can download GPS data files for any discretionary number of hours \u0351\u0d1b24\u0352. Also UFCORS allows users to select how the requested data files should be compressed. UFCORS also can interpolate GPS data to sampling rates, other than the standard 30-s rate. Finally, UFCORS can decimate archived CORS data of one sampling rate to a user specified sampling rate of greater value.\nAnonymous FTP remains the most popular CORS information server in terms of data volume. More than 581 gigabytes of CORS data were distributed via anonymous FTP in April 2008 \u0353Fig. 3\u0351a\u0352\u0354, whereas UFCORS distributed about 66 Gbytes in April 2008 \u0353Fig. 3\u0351b\u0352\u0354.

This adjustment termed NAD 83 \u0351NSRS2007\u0352 held fixed the published NAD 83 \u0351CORS96\u0352 3D positional coordinates of the CORS sites, to obtain a solution whose coordinates are consistent with the NAD 83 \u0351CORS96\u0352 frame. Once more, the CORS network fulfills its primary mission of implementing the NSRS. Thus, because of the procedure followed \u0351Vorhauer 2007\u0352 these \u03f370,000 geodetic marks now have positional coordinates that are compatible with the NAD 83 \u0351CORS96\u0352 reference frame."}, {"section_title": "Assessing GPS Observational Accuracies", "text": "The availability of continuous GPS data from stations well distributed throughout the United States makes it possible to design experiments aimed to answer many questions related to GPS methodologies now in vogue and to expand our understanding of scientific phenomena. Eckl et al. \u03512001\u0352 and Snay et al. \u03512002a\u0352 studied the accuracy of GPS-derived relative positions as a function of interstation distance and observing-session duration using data from 19 CORS sites. Eleven baselines connecting pairs of these 19 sites were formed with lengths ranging from 26 to 300 km. GPS data for each baseline was partitioned into 10 nonoverlapping 24-h sessions. These same data were also subdivided into 20 nonoverlapping 12-h sessions, 30 nonoverlapping 8-h sessions, 40 nonoverlapping 6-h sessions and, finally, 60 nonoverlapping 4-h sessions. The results of this investigation empirically demonstrated that the dependence of accuracy on baseline length is negligibly small, whereas the dependence on the duration time of the observing session obeys the following simple mnemonic rule when the observing time spans 4 h or longer: "}, {"section_title": "Multipath Studies", "text": "For GPS antennas, multipath errors are caused by the interference of signals that have reached the receiver antenna by two or more different paths, usually caused by one path being bounced or reflected from the ground or nearby surfaces \u0351buildings, fences, etc.\u0352. The understanding of multipath effects is important to decipher the systematic errors associated with a particular station and antenna and the possibility to correct for them. Hilla and Cline \u03512004\u0352 conducted an investigation to evaluate the amount of multipath occurring at each of 390+ sites contained in the National CORS network. This study identified the most and least affected sites in the network, compared different receiver/antenna combinations, and investigated closely those sites that appeared to be severely affected by multipath. Dual-frequency carrier phase and pseudorange measurements were used to estimate the amount of L1 and L2 pseudorange multipath at each site over a one-year period. A similar study \u0351Park et al. 2004\u0352 combining CORS and IGS sites also found that the postfit phase residuals were highly dependent on the GPS antenna type. This investigation concluded that antenna types with choke rings are very effective in suppressing multipath and that multipath is highly dependent on the unique environment at each site."}, {"section_title": "Crustal Motion", "text": "Crustal motion monitoring is perhaps one of the most obvious of all CORS applications. If CORS data are rigorously processed and analyzed during a period of several years, then the motion of the Earth's crust can be determined wherever the CORS network provides sufficient coverage. Gan and Prescott \u03512001\u0352 analyzed GPS data observed between 1996 and 2000 for 62 CORS sites distributed throughout the central and eastern United States. Their results suggest that no significant horizontal crustal motion occurred during this time period in this part of the country, except possibly in the lower Mississippi River Valley. This particular area appears to be moving southward relative to the rest of the continent at an average rate of 1.7\u03ee 0.9 mm/ year. Although this rate is not statistically signifi- Number of Gigabytes (b) Fig. 3 . Monthly volumes of CORS data downloaded \u0351a\u0352 using FTP; \u0351b\u0352 using UFCORS cant at the 95% confidence level, the fact that the motion occurs near New Madrid, Mo.-where earthquake risk is thought to be high-argues that the motion may be real. Sella et al. \u03512002\u0352 applied GPS data from the CORS network, together with data from a worldwide distribution of stations, to produce a global \"recent velocity\" \u0351REVEL\u0352 model that quantifies the motions of 19 tectonic plates and continental blocks during the 1993-2000 time interval.\nPark et al. \u03512002\u0352 used data from 60 CORS sites to estimate the upper and lower mantle viscosity by comparing radial site velocities with velocities inferred from glacial isostatic adjustment \u0351GIA\u0352 models. In addition, their GPS-derived velocities are consistent with previous estimates obtained using different methods and data over different time spans.\nRecently, the deformation occurring within the North American plate interior was estimated using 10 years of GPS data from the CORS network processed using both the GIPSY and GAMIT software packages \u0351Calais et al. 2006\u0352. These authors analyzed data from about 300 CORS stations covering the central and eastern United States. The investigation indicates that the velocity field is described within uncertainties by a simple rigid plate rotation that is distorted in some areas by a deformation pattern consistent with GIA. Similarly, using CORS sites and episodic GPS data in Canada and the United States, Sella et al. \u03512007\u0352 show that the strongest signal within the nominally stable interior of the North American plate is the effect of GIA due to mass unloading during deglaciation. On a more local scale, Dokka et al. \u03512006\u0352 used GPS data from CORS sites to infer that southeast Louisiana, including New Orleans and the larger Mississippi Delta, are both subsiding vertically and moving southward with respect to the interior of the North American plate."}, {"section_title": "Sea Level Changes", "text": "The variations of vertical crustal velocities at CORS sites near tide gauge stations may be used to determine the \"absolute\" sea level change with respect to the International Terrestrial Reference Frame. This type of analysis was impossible to conduct before the proliferation of CORS in coastal areas. Recently, a study by Snay et al. \u03512007\u0352 involving 37 tide gauge stations, distributed along the U.S. and Canadian coasts, such that each is located within 40 km of a CORS site, determined rigorously the crustal velocity near tide gauge stations from GPS observations spanning between 3 and 11 years. After calibrating historical tidal data with these derived crustal velocities, the results show that the mean rate of absolute sea level change equals 1.80\u03ee 0.18 mm/ year for the 1900-1999 interval. The same investigation determined the absolute rate of sea level change equals \u22121.19\u03ee 0.70 mm/ year along the southern Alaskan coastline. This lowering of absolute sea level near southern Alaska is probably due to ongoing melting of mountain glaciers and ice masses. With time, more CORS data will become available near tide gauges to conduct investigations able to accurately estimate vertical crustal velocities and thereby absolute sea level rates with greater certainty."}, {"section_title": "Tropospheric Studies", "text": "The delay of GPS signals, which is caused by the refractivity of the troposphere or electrically neutral atmosphere, is associated with temperature, pressure, and the distribution of water vapor up to a height of about 16 km. If the atmospheric pressure is known with reasonable accuracy at the elevation of the GPS antenna, then the total \"wet\" and \"dry\" delay at the site can be effectively separated with little error. Mapping the resulting wet signal delay into the integrated \u0351total column\u0352 precipitable water vapor \u0351IPW\u0352 is accomplished in a straightforward manner if the mean vapor-weighted temperature of the atmosphere is known. Water vapor is one of the most important constituents of the Earth's atmosphere. It is the source of clouds and precipitation, and an ingredient in most major weather events. IPW varies greatly over the planet: \u03fd5 mm near the poles and \u03fe50 mm near the equator. Most \u0351\u03f395% \u0352 of the water in the atmosphere resides below 5 km \u0351or essentially below the 500 hPa pressure surface\u0352. Significant changes in the vertical and horizontal distribution of water vapor can occur rapidly \u0351minutes to hours\u0352 during active weather.\nNOAA's Earth Systems Research Laboratory \u0351ESRL\u0352, formerly called NOAA's Forecast Systems Laboratory, has developed the capability to estimate the spatial and temporal variation of tropospheric delay within the contiguous United States \u0351CONUS\u0352 \u0351Gutman et al. 2004\u0352. Their prediction process is based on modeling the delay using GPS observations from the CORS network in combination with other meteorological data. They update their model every hour. It is possible to use CORS sites to estimate the tropospheric signal delay at each station with high accuracy because of stringent instrument requirements for high accuracy GPS positioning. Data from a network of approximately 385 CORS sites are assimilated hourly into the operational version of the rapid update cycle \u0351RUC\u0352 numerical weather prediction model which refers the results to a two-dimensional \u03512D\u0352 horizontal grid having a 13-km nodal spacing.\nThe Global Systems Division of NOAA's ESRL has developed NOAATrop, a new way to improve GPS positioning, navigation and timing accuracy using real-time weather data at CORS sites \u0351Gutman et al. 2004\u0352. NOAATrop is available for download at ftp://aftp.fsl.noaa.gov/gpsmet/zwdgrids/. This information provides zenith wet delay and ALT \u0351a proxy for zenith hydrostatic delay\u0352 for a 2D grid with 13-km resolution over the CONUS. NOAATrop is based on RUC, an operational model that is updated hourly. The root mean square accuracy of the modeled delays is currently \u03f32 cm in cold seasons and \u03fd4 cm in warm seasons."}, {"section_title": "Ionospheric Studies", "text": "Wide area ionospheric models have been developed to model and mitigate local ionospheric effects. Such models are based on dual frequency observations from a subset of the CORS network.\nThe ionosphere is a dispersive medium located in the region of the upper atmosphere that begins at an altitude of around 50 km and extends upwards several hundred kilometers. The radiation from the Sun and particles precipitating from the magnetosphere produces free electrons and ions that cause phase advances and group delays in radio waves. The state of the ionosphere is a function of the intensity of solar and magnetic activity, position on the Earth, local time and other factors. As GPS signals traverse the ionosphere, they are delayed by an amount proportional to the total electron content \u0351TEC\u0352 within the ionosphere at a given time. This product is designed to quantify TEC over CONUS in near real time and has evolved through collaboration between the SWPC, NGS, ESRL, and NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center.\nData from the CORS network have been used in studies of large-scale ionospheric disturbances caused by geomagnetic storms on a continental scale \u0351Tsugawa et al. 2003\u0352. Investigations to correct for ionospheric effects in local CORS networks \u0351e.g., Ohio State\u0352 established for real-time kinematics \u0351RTK\u0352 applications have proliferated lately with the deployment of stateoperated CORS networks \u0351Wielgoz et al. 2005a,b; GrejnerBrzezinska et al. 2007\u0352 . GPS data from CORS sites have been used to test ionospheric models aimed to improve long baseline differential GPS positioning of rovers using only L1 data \u0351Mo-hino et al. 2007\u0352. Finally, Smith \u03512004\u0352 experimentally introduced an interesting alternative approach to compute absolute \u0351unam-biguous\u0352 TEC values relying only on dual frequency ambiguous carrier phase data from the CORS network, though the approach was only a research prototype."}, {"section_title": "Geolocation of Aerial Moving Platforms", "text": "Data available from CORS sites has been used in many remote sensing applications. The accurate positioning of aircrafts employed in aerial mapping is crucial to improve the reliability of photogrammetric restitution primarily for large-scale aerial survey applications over remote or inaccessible terrain. The same concepts implemented for geolocating landmarks from the air with digital cameras has been extended to a broad array of mapping terrain applications using cutting edge technologies such as scanning radar, light detection and ranging \u0351LiDAR\u0352, inertial systems, interferometric synthetic aperture radar, and/or sonar. The use of CORS data in airborne mapping processes has proven to provide a significant alternative \u0351Mostafa 2005\u0352. The utility of CORS sites in differential GPS aircraft positioning was investigated by Booth and Lunde \u03512003\u0352 showing that very accurate carrier phase differential results can be obtained using much longer baselines than originally thought. The aerial mapping community will certainly benefit from the growing number of CORS sites. Perhaps, the decisive factor in all these applications is the accessibility to GPS data at a 1-s sampling rate instead of the standard of 30-s sampling rate. NGS has cooperated with federal, state, and private institutions to schedule ahead of time changes at specified CORS sites to the 1-s sampling rate. This facilitates the postprocessing of airborne GPS data to accurately estimate the position of a plethora of aerial moving platforms. For example, NGS's Remote Sensing Division obtains aerial imagery to assess hurricane damage. These missions are well served by CORS data, collected at a 1-s sampling rate, to accurately determine the travel path of the aircraft being used to collect aerial imagery. NGS personnel worked closely with their CORS partners to temporarily increase data sampling rates after the hurricanes of 2005. The imagery of areas affected by individual hurricanes is available at www.ngs.noaa.gov."}, {"section_title": "On the CORS Horizon", "text": "In December 2006, NGS installed a new CORS near the tide gauge station located in Key West, Fla. This CORS will help relate local sea level change at Key West to the globally consistent, rigorously defined International Terrestrial Reference Frame. Indeed, NGS plans to install a CORS at each of several additional tide gauge stations contained in the U.S. National Water Level Observation Network \u0351NWLON\u0352. Established in 1913, the Key West tide gauge station is one of the longest continually operational stations contained in the NWLON.\nThe new CORS at Key West is also significant because it is the first CORS, installed by NGS, which collects both GPS and GLONASS data. A number of CORS partners have begun upgrading stations to collect both GPS and GLONASS data, and NGS will soon begin distributing such GNSS data to CORS users.\nAdditionally, several CORS are streaming GPS data in real time to NGS headquarters in Silver Spring, Md. NGS will broadcast these data to the public in real time to support the growth of regional GNSS networks that enable real-time positioning in the United States. In response to user demands, more than 40 organizations, both public and private, are now establishing such regional GNSS networks. Also, many more of these regional realtime positioning networks are expected to be established in the near future. NGS needs to support these networks by developing appropriate standards and guidelines so that:\n\u2022 Promulgated positional coordinates and velocities for the corresponding GNSS base stations are compatible with the NSRS; \u2022 User equipment can operate with services from different realtime GNSS networks to the greatest extent possible; and \u2022 Stations contained in each real-time network meet prescribed criteria in terms of stability and data quality. Accordingly, NGS is considering the possibility of streaming GNSS data from about 200 federally funded CORS so that this agency may understand the intricacies involved in operating a real-time GNSS network to the extent necessary to develop appropriate standards and guidelines.\nNGS encourages the institutions, who are providing real-time positioning services, to use the NGS-provided data in their operations so as to \u03511\u0352 supplement the data from other GNSS base stations, and \u03512\u0352 use the positional coordinates and velocities of the GNSS stations contained in the NGS real-time network as fiducial values for determining positional coordinates and velocities of other real-time GNSS stations. Also, NGS is planning to stream these data because U.S. citizens should have real-time access to data from federally funded stations in the CORS network whenever it is economically and technically feasible to do so. It is important to emphasize that NGS intends to stream only the GNSS observables and not \"correctors\" to these observables. Also, NGS does not intend to stream GNSS data that are already being streamed by another organization. In all likelihood, NGS will use NTRIP \u0351networked transport of RTCM standard via internet protocol\u0352 to broadcast the stream of GNSS observables over the Internet."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The intent of this paper was to summarize the history, applications, and future prospects of the CORS network by describing the more important contributions of the CORS system to the scientific community. Many surveying engineers, geodesists, mapping specialists, as well as scientists from different backgrounds, are using CORS on a daily basis by downloading GPS data through UFCORS and anonymous FTP, and then postprocessing these data for a variety of applications. The CORS network has contributed significantly to geodetic positioning by providing easy and accurate access to the NSRS. The CORS network should also be recognized for supporting the research of numerous scientific investigators. Finally, the CORS network serves as the primary data source for all types of OPUS solutions."}]
