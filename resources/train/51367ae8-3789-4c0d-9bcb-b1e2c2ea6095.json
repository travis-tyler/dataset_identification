Deposits generated by along-slope currents are known as 'contourites' or 'contourite drifts' (see McCave and Tucholke, 1986;Rebesco and Stow, M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 2001). 'Erosional features' (e.g., abraded surfaces, contourite channels, contourite moats) are locally developed in association with contourite drifts in areas traversed by higher velocity current cores (e.g., Garc\u00eda et al., 2009;Cattaneo et al., 2017). In some settings, 'mixed features' develop due to long-term depositional and erosional phases that form contourite terraces (e.g., Viana et al., 2007;Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2009, 2017a. Other settings host interactions between along-slope (contourites) and across-slope gravity-driven processes (turbidity currents and mass transport deposits). These processes may form 'hybrid features' (e.g., Creaser et al., 2017;Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2017b;Sansom, 2018). The range of depositional, erosional and mixed (erosional-depositional) features associated with a particular water mass can be interpreted as a 'Contourite Depositional System' (CDS). Continental margins host a number of CDSs associate to a water mass within a given depth range. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of combining oceanographic analysis and geomorphologic approaches in interpreting CDSs (e.g., western South Atlantic margin: Preu et al., 2013;Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2016a;Gulf of Cadiz: Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2016b;Mediterranean Sea: Cattaneo et al., 2017). However, CDSs can become difficult to decipher (e.g., Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2006a) in the case of interactions of several different water masses, intermittent oceanographic processes (e.g., eddies, internal waves), and / or complex physiography. These special cases remain less understood due to lack of direct observations (Rebesco et al., 2014). Since initial publication of studies on current-controlled sedimentation along the southern Mozambique basin (e.g., Kolla et al., 1980;6, Fig. 1A), the southwestern region of the Indian Ocean and its CDSs have enjoyed growing scientific interest ( Fig. 1A). To date, deposits directly linked to bottom current action have been described from at least eight different locations (Fig. 1A). The largest features are associated with water masses formed from Antarctic and sub-Antarctic sources. These include features along the northeastern Agulhas Ridge and Cape Rise seamounts (Gruetzner and Uenzelmann-Neben, 2015; 1, Fig. 1A), contourite drifts of the Transkei, which include the Oribi drift, M-drift (Niemi et al., 2000;3, Fig. 1A), and Agulhas drift (Schl\u00fcter and Uenzelmann-Neben, 2008; 3, Fig. 1A), features along the southern Mozambique Ridge (Uenzelmann-Neben et al., 2011;7, Fig. 1A), features along the Agulhas Plateau and Passage (Uenzelmann-Neben, 2001;Uenzelmann-Neben and Huhn, 2009;2 and 8, Fig. 1A), and features along the continental margin of Mozambique off the Limpopo River (Preu et al., 2011;5, Fig. 1A). In summary, these M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT studies link the development of contourite features to particular water masses and water depth ranges. Despite the strong influence that circulation exerts on sedimentary processes (e.g., Wiles et al., 2014Wiles et al., , 2017Breitzke et al., 2017), long stretches of the East African continental margin have not been interpreted in terms of their depositional processes. This paper presents novel analysis of water mass influence on seafloor morphology to interpret CDSs along the East African continental margin between the latitudes of 15\u00b0 S and 30\u00b0 S (hereafter the Mozambique Channel). The primary aims of this work are 1) to identify the main regional sedimentary features related to bottom current action, 2) to generate a regional morpho-sedimentary map of the Mozambique Channel and 3) to interpret the interplay between sedimentary and oceanographic processes."}, {"section_title": "Regional setting", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Geologic setting", "text": "The Mozambique Channel is located in the southwest Indian Ocean between the East African continental margin of Mozambique and Madagascar (Fig. 1A). It developed during the break-up of East Gondwana (i.e., Madagascar, India, Antarctica, and Australia) and West Gondwana (i.e., Africa and South America) (McElhinny, 1970;McKenzie and Sclater, 1971). Rifting began in the Early-Middle Jurassic (183 -177 Ma; Eagles and K\u00f6nig, 2008) with the opening of the northern Mozambique basin (159 Ma to 124 Ma; Jokat et al., 2003;K\u00f6nig and Jokat, 2010;Leinweber and Jokat, 2012;Leinweber et al., 2013) and persisted to the Early Cretaceous opening of the southern Mozambique Basin (124 Ma to 84 Ma;Gradstein et al., 2012) and the Natal Valley (135 Ma to 115 / 90 Ma;Goodlad et al., 1982;Watkeys and Sokoutis, 1998). Currently, the Mozambique Channel consists of three major basins: the northern Mozambique basin, the southern Mozambique basin, and the Durban basin (Fig. 1B). The northern Mozambique basin is bounded by the East African continental margin of Mozambique to the west and by the Davie Fracture Zone (DFZ) to the east. The DFZ developed during southerly movement of East Gondwana (including Madagascar) Rabinowitz, 1987, 1992) and was later reactivated by extensional deformation (e.g., Lacerda Graben) since the late Miocene (Mougenot et al., 1986). A group of isolated carbonate platforms (e.g., Bassas Da India) formed in the middle of the northern Mozambique basin from the Paleocene to early Miocene (Courgeon et al., 2016). Late Miocene-early Pliocene cessation of carbonate deposition and initiation of graben formation along the DFZ M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT appears to be coeval and spatially linked with the development and propagation of the East African Rift System (Franke et al., 2015). The southern Mozambique basin is bounded to the west by the Mozambique Ridge (MozR), which occurs about 100 km off the coast, and to the east by the Madagascar Ridge (MdgR) ( Fig. 1B). Both ridges are interpreted to represent a large igneous province of oceanic origin (Sinha et al., 1981;Fischer et al., 2017) forming between 140 and 122 Ma for the Mozambique Ridge (K\u00f6nig and Jokat, 2010). Finally, the Durban basin represents the eastern termination of a major east-west trending fault system, the Agulhas-Falkland Fracture Zone (Broad et al., 2006). Open marine sedimentation began in the Early Cretaceous for the northern and southern Mozambique basins and in the Late Cretaceous for the Durban basin (Davison and Steel, 2017). Over the past 30 Ma, the areas of interest have experienced significant periods of middle Oligocene, middle Miocene, and late Pliocene hinterland uplift (Castelino et al., 2015). Periods of uplift are associated with increase in sediment transport to the adjacent basins along the southwestern Indian Ocean (Walford et al., 2005;Wiles et al., 2014;Castelino et al., 2015;Hicks and Green, 2016). Sediment delivery to the Mozambique Channel is complex and related to global eustatic changes and hinterland tectonics (Walford et al., 2005;Castelino et al., 2015;Hicks and Green, 2016;Wiles et al., 2017). Sediments are primarily sourced from the adjacent Zambezi river (present-day catchment of 1.39\u202210 6 km 2 ), Limpopo river (present-day catchment of 4.15 \u202210  5 km   2   ), and Tugela river (present-day catchment of 2.91\u202210 4 km 2 ) ( Fig. 1A). These control the general sediment type and flux delivered to the Mozambique Channel over time."}, {"section_title": "Oceanographic framework", "text": "The south Indian Ocean hosts a variety of water masses characterized by different hydrographic properties as summarized in Table I. At present, oceanic circulation along the Mozambique Channel consists primarily of the southward flowing Mozambique current and the northward flowing Mozambique undercurrent (De Ruijter et al., 2002). The Mozambique current is part of the Agulhas current system (Lutjeharms, 2006) and is characterized by anticyclonic eddies with diameters of ~300 km (Fig. 2). Four to six anticyclonic eddies per year occur in the Channel, and propagate southwards at ~3 -6 km/day (de Ruijter et al., 2002;Schouten et al., 2003;Halo et al., 2014). The Mozambique current carries Tropical Surface Water, Subtropical Surface Water (TSW and STSW, < 200 m water depth, wd), the South Indian Central Water (SICW, between 200 and 600 m wd) (De Ruijter et al., 2002), and the northwest Indian-origin Red Sea Water (RSW, 900 -1200 m wd) (Donohue et al., 2000;Beal et al., 2000;Swart et al., 2010). The Mozambique and Agulhas undercurrents flow northward along the Mozambican continental slope (Fig. 2) carrying Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW, 800 -1500 m wd) after its westward flow over the Madagascar ridge (Fine, 1993) and the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW, -3500 m wd), which flows into the Natal Valley (Toole and Warren, 1993) towards the southern Mozambique basin, south of the Mozambique Ridge. A portion of the NADW flows into the southern Mozambique basin across deep corridors within the Mozambique Ridge (Wiles et al., 2014). The upper volume of the NADW crosses a sill in the northern Mozambique basin to enter the Somali Basin, while the remaining NADW flows along the eastern boundary of the northern Mozambique basin with a southerly returning current (van Aken et al., 2004;Ullgren et al., 2012). The Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) circulates below 4000 m wd (Fig. 2). It flows northward as a western boundary current along the southern Mozambique basin (Tucholke and Embley, 1984;Read and Pollard, 1999). Because the basin is closed in the north, the AABW is deflected to form a southerly flowing boundary current along the east flank of the southern Mozambique basin (Kolla et al., 1980)."}, {"section_title": "Data and methods", "text": "This study utilizes bathymetry, multichannel 2D seismic reflection profiles, hydrographic data, and hydrodynamic modelling. A slope gradient map was generated using GEBCO 2014 (Weatherall et al., 2015). The bathymetric base map included data from previous works of Wiles et al. (2014Wiles et al. ( , 2017 and Breitzke et al. (2017), which were used to generate the morpho-sedimentary map. Profiles interpreted derive from a regional 2D multichannel seismic reflection (MCSs) dataset ( Fig. 1) acquired for the Mozambique basin during 2013 / 2014 geophysical cruises by WesternGeco. This primary dataset represents a regional grid of linear, 36179 km MCSs spaced at approximately 10 to 70 km intervals. Profiles were migrated in time. A second dataset was acquired for the Durban basin in 2013 -2014 by CGG. The secondary dataset consists of widely spaced arrays spanning 6920 km and including 17 strike lines and 25 dip lines. The data were processed with Kirchhoff pre-stack time migration. Major morpho-sedimentary features were identified and mapped using bathymetry and seismic profiles."}, {"section_title": "M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT", "text": "Oceanographic analysis was performed using hydrographic data from the World Ocean Database (WOD13; https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/WOD13/) and a Regional Oceanic Modelling System (ROMS, version CROCO: https://www.croco-ocean.org/). Hydrographic data from WOD13 was used to create combined hydrographic and seismic cross sections. Due to the lack of hydrographic sections, we constructed cross-slope sections by combining all available conductivity, temperature, salinity, and depth (CTD) stations and then projecting water sample stations onto the seismic cross-section at distances of up to km. The cross-sections were created using Ocean Data View (Schlitzer, 2013). CTD data were also used for generating potential temperature-salinity diagrams in order to identify water masses present along the Mozambique Channel. The Regional Oceanic Modelling System (ROMS, CROCO version), a three dimensional ocean model described by Shchepetkin and McWilliams (2005), was used to simulate the bottom currents in the Mozambique Channel. ROMS is a primitive equation model that can estimate basin-scale, regional and coastal oceanic processes at high resolution (Shchepetkin and McWilliams, 2005). ROMS uses a topography following vertical grid allowing explicit resolution of interactions between bottom topography and ocean dynamics. The model used the GEBCO 2014 (Weatherall et al., 2015) bathymetric base map smoothed for numeric constraints. The model simulation ran for 21 years (from 1993 to 2014). The model surface conditions are derived from the ERA Interim atmospheric reanalysis (Dee et al., 2011) using a bulk formulation (Fairall et al., 1996). The lateral boundary conditions are drawn from a global ocean reanalysis GLORYS (Ferry et al., 2012). To reach a high resolution 1/36\u00b0 (~3 km) in the Mozambique Channel, three levels of embedded grids are used, based on the AGRIF two-way nesting method (Debreu et al., 2012). Since the mean kinematic bottomshear-stress induced by tides affects only the shelf (i.e., Bight of Sofala; Chevane et al., 2016), barotropic tides were not introduced in the model for this simulation. Three cross-slope hydrographic sections based on CTD stations from northern, central, and southern sector water columns were used to interpret relations between water mass stratification and sedimentary features along the continental margin. Combining these sections with potential salinity-temperature-oxygen diagrams from the same dataset allowed us to identify the main water masses in each physiographic domain. This approach also revealed lateral variation in water mass dynamics along the Mozambique Channel. Accurate identification of water masses and their spatial correlation with seafloor morphology can elucidate longerterm oceanographic and sedimentary processes (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2016a). Calculated as the oscillation frequency of a parcel displaced vertically in a statically stable environment, the buoyancy or Brunt-V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 frequency (N) provides information on water column stratification (Da Silva et al., 2009). It is calculated from hydrographic data (World Ocean Database 2013) as: where g is the gravitational acceleration, \u03c1 is the density, and is the vertical density gradient. This analytical approach identified numerous bottom current-controlled depositional and erosional features. We use the term 'contourites' for sediments deposited or substantially reworked by the persistent action of bottom currents (Faug\u00e8res and Stow, 2008). This term includes a large variety of sediments affected by different types of currents (Rebesco et al., 2014). Thick, extensive sedimentary accumulations are defined as 'contourite drifts' or 'drifts'. Interpretation of features followed criteria for drift morphology and internal configuration detailed in McCave and Tucholke (1986), Faug\u00e8res et al. (1999), Rebesco and Stow (2001), Rebesco (2005), and Rebesco et al. (2014).\ndisplacement (~100 m) produced by internal waves propagation can be observed directly from Envisat advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) images (Fig. 10). It shows clear evidence of internal waves travelling oceanward away from the shelf break (Figs. 10E, and 10D) and toward the continental shelf (Figs. 10A, 10B,   and 10C). In Fig. 9, higher buoyancy (Brunt-V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4) frequency is observed on the proximal and / or nearly flat sector of terrace T1. It coincides with the water depth range of the interface between TSW + STSW / SICW (\u223c200 m wd). DaSilva et al. (2009) observed internal waves travelling at 1.4 m/s with wavelengths of 0.5 km along the pycnocline near the surface (\u223c60 -100 m). It leads to oscillation around 10 cycl/h which is consistent with values observed along T1 at ~100 m wd (Fig. 9B). For T2, high values of buoyancy (Brunt-V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4) frequency along the water depth range of the interface between SICW / AAIW (\u223c800 m wd) (Fig. 9A) indicate a stably-stratified boundary layer, allowing for internal waves to propagate (Maas et al., 2018). Lastly, Maas et al. (2018) indicated that the fluctuation of the isopycnal (displacements of 80 m) at 1500 wd was in general dominated by the internal tides, as reported for internal waves above. This fact point to a probable propagation of internal waves in the water depth range of T3. However, the study of Maas et al. 2018is located along the narrowest part of the Mozambique Channel (17\u00b0 S) while T3 occurs at around 22\u00b0 S (Fig. 4). This assumption remains nevertheless to be confirmed by further studies. Hence, we suggest that internal waves of tidal period may act as the primary mechanism in the erosion or non-deposition of contourite terraces T1, T2 and T3 as have been proposed along the south Atlantic continental slopes (e.g., Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2009;Preu et al., 2013). These can mobilize and re-suspend bottom sediments (e.g., Cacchione et al., 2002;McCave, 2009;Pomar et al., 2012;Shanmugam, 2013)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Physiography of the study area", "text": "The Mozambique Channel includes three major physiographic provinces, as defined by IHO and IOC (1983): the continental shelf, the continental slope and the abyssal plain (Fig. 3). All three margin provinces were interpreted from southern, central, and northern sectors of the study area. These represent the Tugela, Limpopo, and Zambezi Rivers discharge areas, respectively (Fig. 1A). The continental shelf exhibits an average gradient of 0.4\u00b0. It is particularly narrow (\u223c2 -15 km in width) compared to the global average of \u223c50 km (Shepard, 1963), except in the regions in front of the Tugela, Limpopo and Zambezi rivers (i.e., 51 km, 80 km and 130 km respectively) ( Fig. 3). The continental slope is bordered to the west by the shelf-break, which is around 50 -120 m water depths (set at \u223c200 m wd in this study). In the study area, the continental slope exhibits a relatively gentle gradient (1.1\u00b0 on average) relative to the global average slope (3\u00b0, Kennett, 1982). The slope divides into upper, middle, and lower subdomains. Each subdomain was defined to highlight zones of abrupt changes in seabed gradient ( Fig. 3 and Table II); the upper, middle and lower slope, respectively, have an average gradient of: 1.6\u00b0, 1.1\u00b0 and 0.9\u00b0, and occur between isobaths of: 200 to 1000 m, 1000 to 1600 m, and 1600 to 2400 m. The morphological seafloor changes that determine the upper, middle and lower slope subdomains roughly coincide with the distribution of large-scale flatter areas or terraces. These terraces have been described and locally characterized by Martin (1981) in the central sector: the Inharrime terrace (< 800 m wd) and the Central terrace (\u223c1400 -2000 m wd), which are separated by the SW-NE rough topography of the Almirante Leite Bank. Furthermore, a broad (\u223c90 km) gently seaward dipping (0.3\u00b0) terrace occurs around 21\u00b0 S (1300 -1600 m wd) that has been described by Wiles et al. (2017) (Fig. 3). In this study, the base-of-slope is set at 2400 m water depth (wd). In areas where the buried Beira High and the Mozambique Ridge abut the continental slope (i.e., 21\u00b0 S to 29\u00b0 S), a steep surface (2 -10\u00b0) develops at the foot of the lower slope (from \u223c2400 m wd) ( Fig. 3). In this study, this feature belongs to the abyssal plain province. The abyssal plain of the southern sector (i.e., Natal Valley) lies between 2400 m (uppermost, narrowest part) and \u223c3000 m wd (southward at \u223c31\u00b0 S). This feature is bounded to the east by the Mozambique Ridge, which rises to a depth of 1800 m (Fig. 3). The Mozambique Ridge deepens along E-W oriented pathways (at depths of \u223c2000 -3000 m wd) connecting the abyssal plain regions of the Natal Valley and the southern Mozambique basin. The abyssal plain depth of the Mozambique basin in the northern and central sector increases from \u223c2400 m to \u223c4000 m wd southward at \u223c27\u00b0 S. The large-scale morphology of the abyssal plain includes numerous seamounts (i.e., Bassas Da India and Boucart) ( Fig. 3)."}, {"section_title": "Gravitational features", "text": "The continental slope of the southern sector hosts numerous submarine canyons extending from the upper slope to the distal limit of the lower slope. Northward (and south of the Tugela canyon), submarine canyons only occur within the lower slope ( Fig. 4). Tugela canyon obliquely crosscuts the continental slope and feeds the Tugela Cone, a deep-water fan complex (Fig. 4).  (Fig. 4). Evidence of down-slope sedimentary processes is common along the slope of the northern sector. Large Mass Transport Deposits (MTDs) appear in the middle to lower slope, where huge deposits gather on the seafloor (Fig. 4) or appear as buried features in seismic profiles (Fig. 5C). This sector also hosts many submarine canyon systems (SCSs). Wiles et al. (2017) identified three different SCSs of this area. From north to south, these include the Angoche SCS, the Middle Zambezi SCS, and the Lower Zambezi SCS (Fig. 4). In the Angoche SCS, the margin consists of a series of canyons that extend across the shelf towards the lower slope and from the shelf to the middle slope ( Fig. 4). These canyons reach widths of up to 4 km ( "}, {"section_title": "Contourite features", "text": "Our analysis identified a wide range of contourite features, including depositional (drifts and sedimentary waves), erosional (abraded surfaces, moats, channels, scours, and furrows), and mixed (contourite terraces) features occurring from the shelf break to the abyssal plain ( Fig. 4). Contourite drifts represent important along-slope accumulations of sediment that appear as continuous, layered seismic reflections with internal, regional-scale unconformities ( Fig. 6). Erosional features are mainly characterized by truncated reflections underlying stratified and / or chaotic facies. These generally show relatively high amplitude reflections (HARs) relative to those representing associated drifts (Fig. 6). (contourite terraces) display similar seismic facies defined by continuous to discontinuous, subparallel, and occasionally truncated seismic reflections ( Fig. 6). High amplitude reflections are generally found along these terraces with a number of 2D sedimentary waves (e.g., Flemming, 1978;Green, 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Depositional contourite features", "text": "Drifts are the dominant depositional features observed. The largest of these features are 'plastered drifts' and 'elongated-mounded drifts'. Large, plastered drifts of the Mozambique continental slope show a prominent along-slope trend (Fig. 4). Elongated-mounded drifts are dispersed throughout the continental slope and abyssal plain of Mozambique's central sector (Fig. 4). In addition to large-scale plastered and elongated-mounded drifts, other minor depositional features include large 'sedimentary waves' previously described by Breitzke et al. (2017). These exhibit a wavy geometry ( Fig. 5B) and occur throughout the abyssal plain, particularly south of the Bassas Da India seamounts in the centre of the Mozambique Channel (Fig. 4). The three plastered drifts recognized in this study were informally referred to as D1 to D3 based on their water depth range along the slope (D1 being the shallowest and D3 the deepest; Fig. 4). 'Plastered drifts 1 and 2' (D1 and D2) are located between \u223c300 and 600 m wd along the upper slope and between \u223c900 and 1300 m wd along the middle slope, respectively (Fig. 4). These show aggradational and progradational internal reflection configurations with thickness variations that indicate depocenters parallel to the slope (Figs. 5E, 6A, 6B, and 6I). In the southern sector, the 10 -40 km wide D1 developed between 30\u00b0 S and the Tugela Cone (Fig.   4). In the central sector, D1 spans about 20 km width and extends \u223c56 km along the Inharrime Terrace (Fig. 4). In the northern sector, D1 is about 7 km wide and disappears near 18\u00b0 S (Fig. 4). In the southern sector, the 15 km wide D2 developed between 30\u00b0 S and the Tugela Cone (Fig. 4). In the central sector, between 29\u00b0 S and 25\u00b0 S, D2 spans about 10 km in width (Fig. 4), and extends \u223c116 km near 27\u00b0 S before it disappears in the vicinity of topographic highs associated with the Almirante Leite Bank (Fig. 4). North of the Almirante Leite Bank, D2 is about 6 -30 km wide and disappears in the vicinity of the southeastern limb of the Beira High, near the northern sector (Fig. 4). The deeper 'plastered drift 3' (D3) occurs in the lower slope of the central sector (between \u223c27\u00b0 S and 29\u00b0 S) at \u223c1500 -2200 m wd ( Fig. 4). Between the Tugela Cone and the abraded surface, D3 extends to 88 km width (Fig. 4). In this area, D3 exhibits aggradational to progradational internal reflections with a more pronounced upslope progradational stacking pattern than those exhibited by drifts D1 and D2 6C). North of the abraded surface, D3 extends to a width of about 110 km along the Central Terrace ( Fig.   4) and exhibits predominantly progradational and seaward internal reflections ( Fig. 6E). Apart of the aforementioned plastered drifts D1 to D3, the central sector hosts other 'elongatedmounded drifts' (Fig. 4). Along the distal limit of the middle slope, elongated-mounded drifts occur east of the Almirante Leite Bank, near 24\u00b0 S ( Fig. 4), where they reach about km in width ( Fig. 6B). Along the lower slope, elongated-mounded drifts are widespread from 22\u00b0 S to 26\u00b0 S, ranging 1 -20 km in width (Fig. 4). with wavelengths around 2.5 -3 km. These features generally orient in a NE-SW direction, but then shift to WSW-ENE and WNW-ESE orientations to the north (Fig. 4). For water depths between \u223c3000 and 3400 m, sedimentary waves reach heights of 35 -60 m, wavelengths around 1 -2 km, and lengths of up to 10 km. These shallower features strike NW-SE, but shift into W-E and NE-SW orientations to the east (Fig. 4)."}, {"section_title": "Erosional contourite features", "text": "Erosive contourite features occur locally along the Mozambican continental margin and basin floor. Erosional features include moats / contourite channels, abraded surfaces, and lineations (i.e., scours and furrows) ( Terraces develop along the upper slope (T1 at \u223c300 m wd) near the transition between upper and middle slopes (T2 at \u223c800 m wd), near the transition between middle and lower slopes (T3 at \u223c1500 m wd), and along the lower slope (T4 at \u223c2200 m wd) (Figs. 4, and 5B).

By contrast, current direction indicated southward transport deflected E-SE associated with the highest estimated current velocities (> 12.5 cm/s) (Figs. 11A, 11C, and 11D).

Manders et al. (2004) demonstrated that the barotropic tidal current (with the dominant M 2 component) velocity oscillates within \u00b1 2 -5 cm/s in north-south direction. The east-west oriented tidal current oscillates within \u00b1 1 cm/s and is thus negligible, except along the shelf (30 -70 cm/s; Chevane et al., 2016). Interaction between the barotropic tidal current with the bottom topography, in regions where it changes more or less abruptly, as ridges, banks, slopes, shelf breaks, etc., may often result in the generation of large internal waves of tidal period, known as internal (baroclinic) tides (Shanmugam, 2013;Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2016b). According to Manders et al. (2004), internal semi-diurnal tidal current oscillates within \u00b1 3 -4 cm/s, with peaks exceeded 12 cm/s (~250 m wd). Internal waves of tidal period (M 2 ) are also a major driving force for vertical displacements of the isopycnals (Maas et al., 2018).

Such eddies are well described along the Mozambique Channel (de Ruijter et al., 2002). These eddies have a large barotropic component, affecting the whole water column with current velocities ~50 -25 cm/s at ~200 -300 m wd, respectively (Ternon et al., 2014). Current velocities are, however, greatly weakened near the bottom (~10 cm/s at depths > 2000 m) (Schouten et al., 2003). Consequently, these eddies were able to induce erosion or non-deposition along the contourite terraces. This finding is consistent with the area of erosion or non-deposition of T1 along the Inharrime Terrace (Martin, 1981) (Fig. 4) maintained by strong bottom currents due to eddies (Lamont et al., 2010;Preu et al., 2011). As a final remark, internal waves are also likely to be amplified by interaction with mesoscale eddies (Magalhaes et al., 2014;Xie et al., 2015). Beal et al. (2006) also suggested eddy-induced generation of internal waves along the upper boundary of the NADW (\u223c2200 m wd) in the water depth range of T4 (e.g., Cl\u00e9ment et al., 2017)."}, {"section_title": "The effect of along-slope bottom currents", "text": "Another possible mechanism controlling sediment dynamics originates from the along-slope bottom currents. reduce or even revert circulation modulated by periodic or a-periodic processes (eddies, deep water tidal currents, etc.). Additionally, internal waves may be generated when the along-slope bottom currents flow over rough topography (Liang and Thurnherr 2012)."}, {"section_title": "Along-slope bottom current circulation governs the formation of plastered drifts", "text": "Large-scale plastered drifts (D1 and D2) occur on a regional scale along the Mozambican margin while plastered drift D3 occurs on a more local scale (Fig. 4). These occur in basinward areas and in distal areas of contourite terraces T1, T2 and T3, respectively (Figs. 6A, 6C, and 6E). Plastered drift water depths range from \u223c300 to 600 m for D1, \u223c900 to 1300 m for D2 and \u223c1600 to \u223c2200 m for D3. Their distribution determines morphological seafloor changes that roughly coincide with the major physiographic provinces (D1, upper slope; D2, middle slope; and D3, lower slope; Figs. 5, and 6). Thus, these have significant effect in the shaping of the continental margin (e.g., Mosher et al., 2017). Hydrographic sections indicate that D1 and D2 match the near-bottom layer distribution of water masses bounded by the most pronounced density contrasts (pycnoclines) (Fig. 9). We therefore interpret large plastered drifts D1 and D2 along the Mozambican slope as influenced by the SICW (200 -600 m wd) and AAIW (800 -1500 m wd), respectively (Figs. 8A, and 8B). In contrast, plastered drift D3 occurs in the transition zone between AAIW (800 -1500 m wd) and NADW (2200 -3500 m wd). Along-slope bottom currents move relatively slowly in the water depth range occupied by the plastered drifts (~5 -10 cm/s) (Fig. 11). These currents exhibit generally southward direction over D1 (  11B, and 11D). This hypothesis is further confirmed by other studies: Martin (1981) demonstrated that rapid sediment accumulation of D1 along the Inharrime Terrace occurs under weak southward flow conditions; and Beal (2009) reported weak northward flow velocities of 10 cm/s at m wd in the water depth range of D2. These morpho-sedimentary and hydrographic coincidences lead us to propose that the regional physiographic configuration of the Mozambican margin is most likely related to along-slope bottom currents. Seismic profiles indicate that the present-day physiographic configuration and the sub-bottom architecture of the plastered drifts have a stable behaviour on geological timescales, as reported by Dingle et al. (1978) and Preu et al. (2011) for D1 along the Inharrime Terrace. It allows us to suggest a long-term, stable behaviour of the water masses (e.g., Rebesco et al., 2014;Ercilla et al., 2016). Thus, the observed variability of geostrophic flows in the region (eddies, deep water tidal currents, etc.) appears to have no significant effect in the longterm shaping of the continental margin. Although their apparent not significant effect may simply reflect poor interpretation because their importance cannot be resolved in our seismic profiles. This point was mentioned in the study of Ercilla et al. (2016). Lastly, the actual oceanographic model and all observed variability (eddies, deep water tidal currents, etc.) might differ over the geological time span of plastered drifts formation. This scenario might explain the present-day unusual location of D3 in the water depth range of the transition zone between two water masses (AAIW and NADW)."}, {"section_title": "Influence of bottom topography on bottom current processes", "text": "The AAIW and NADW encounter obstacles such as seamounts (i.e., Almirante Leite Bank, Naud\u00e9 Ridge), the Beira High and the Mozambique Ridge. These obstacles produce streamline distortions, creating current cores that can winnow, distribute, erode, and rework near-surface sediment (e.g., Kennett, 1982;Faug\u00e8res et al., 1999;Garc\u00eda et al., 2009). The AAIW and NADW usually have main current cores that run northward, parallel to isobaths along the walls of the obstacles (e.g., Dingle et al., 1987) (Fig. 11). The velocity of these cores manifests in erosive features (moats, contourite channels, abraded surfaces, and lineations; scours and furrows) ( Fig. 4). Moats are associated with elongated-mounded drifts at the foot of high walls, as well as the abraded surfaces along their walls (e.g., Kennett, 1982;Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2006b) (Figs. 4, 5, and 6). These features suggest helicoidal flows around the cores of the current, referred to as 'horizontal eddies' (Rebesco et al., 2014). It result from Coriolis effect directing the cores of the current against the adjacent slope eroding the left side of the moat and depositing sediment on the right side where the current velocity is lower (e.g., Llave et al., 2001;Faug\u00e8res and Mulder, 2011). The currents then form the abraded surfaces north of the Naud\u00e9 Ridge (Fig. 6D) and along the steep lower-slopes of the Mozambique margin (Figs.   5B, 6G, and 6H). They also influence contourite channels and moats along the Almirante Leite Bank (Fig. 4), on the Mozambican lower-slope (Figs. 5B, and 6B), at the foot of the Mozambique Ridge (Figs. 5B, 6F, and 6G), and eastern-limb of the Beira High (Fig. 6G), and across deep, E-W corridors within the Mozambique Ridge ( Fig. 4; described in Wiles et al., 2014). Finally, they form elongated-mounded drifts immediately seaward of moats (Figs. 5B, 6B, 6F, and 6G). As shown in Fig. 11, bands of high bottom current velocities (> 25 cm/s) correspond either to the presence of moats / contourite channels or abraded surfaces, while elongatedmounded drifts experience the lowest bottom current velocities (< 12.5 cm/s). Both are associated with northward flowing water masses of the AAIW and NADW within the Mozambique and Agulhas undercurrents. However, Fig. 11C shows the complexity of AAIW circulation, a large part of which is diverted southward. Observations of Dingle et al. (1978) and Martin (1981) support the interpretation given here by emphasizing that the deepest moats lie along upstream (NE) flanks of topographic highs centered on the Almirante Leite Bank between \u223c900 and 1300 m wd. This suggests southward flow of the AAIW following the model of Faug\u00e8res et al. (1999), Llave et al. (2001), andHern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al. (2006b). Re-circulation of the AAIW may be due to the occurrence of passing moving anticyclonic eddies that also carry the RSW southward at a depth of \u223c900 -1200 m (Gr\u00fcndlingh, 1985;Ridderinkhof and de Ruijter, 2003). Beal (2009) also defined the core of the Agulhas undercurrent at 1000 -2900 m wd, where it carries both AAIW and NADW northward. For the northern part of the Mozambique Channel near 17\u00b0 S, Ridderinkhof and de Ruijter (2003) interpreted the core of the Mozambique undercurrent at 1500 -2400 m wd and suggested entrainment of the AAIW southward where it exits the local undercurrent. Sedimentary waves at water depths of 2500 to 3500 m along the abyssal plain are linked to the presence of the NADW, which would be locally guided by seafloor irregularities and incisions created by the Zambezi Valley and seamounts (i.e., Bassas Da India, Mt. Boucart) (Figs. 4, and 11). Breitzke et al. (2017) demonstrated that these sedimentary waves are draped with sediments, indicating that present-day velocities cannot erode sediments along this part of the abyssal plain. At water depths greater than \u223c3500 m, Breitzke et al. (2017) described bedforms as consisting mainly of large sedimentary waves, giant erosional scours, and furrows. These occur in the transition zone (~500 m) between the NADW (< 3500 m) and the AABW (> 4000 m) and within the AABW. Crests tend to be aligned oblique to the current direction in the case of sedimentary waves associated with geostrophic bottom currents (Fox et al., 1968;Manley and Flood, 1993). Simulation results (Fig. 11E) demonstrate that bottom currents direction is consistent with the oblique alignments of the sediment wave crests (Fig. 4). Here, the shallow bathymetry (< 4000 m wd) of the northern part of the margin topographically blocks the AABW to the north and deflects it eastward. Thus, we can infer that these features likely result from the geostrophic flows (~12.5 cm/s), being aided by internal waves in the transition zone of NADW and AABW (3500 -4000 m wd) (Kolla et al., 1980). Furrows, observed to run oblique relative to the main bottom currents, and scours point toward the northward flowing AABW (Figs. 4, and 11E). Furthermore, high northward flow velocities (> 25 cm/s) at the foot of the Mozambique Ridge (along 37\u00b0 E, Fig. 11E) suggest the role of 'horizontal eddies' in generating these features (e.g., Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2014)."}, {"section_title": "A model for deep-sea sedimentation in the Mozambique Channel", "text": "We present a new model for deep-sea sedimentation within the Mozambique Channel (Fig. 12). Sediments from the continent are mainly transported by the Zambezi, Limpopo, and Tugela rivers. When these rivers reach coastal areas, the Mozambique Current and Agulhas Current quickly disperse the suspended sediment over large areas along the continental shelf and upper slope. The Mozambique Undercurrent and Agulhas Undercurrent subsequently transport and deposit the sediment along the middle-lower slopes, baseof-slope, seamount flanks, and abyssal plain. The TSW + STSW (+ Tropical Thermocline Water) / SICW, SICW / AAIW (+ RSW), AAIW (+ RSW) / NADW, and NADW / AABW interfaces along the Mozambican margin form superimposed nepheloid layers by settling processes Preu et al., 2013). For example, finegrained sediments arriving as turbidity currents from the continent are remobilized by the NADW / AABW interface and subsequently concentrated into a dense nepheloid layer between 3500 and 4500 m wd (Kolla et al., 1980). These layers represent a major regional / basin scale transport mechanism for fine-grained sediments at different water depths. They deposit sediments laterally and basinward with a dominant alongslope component. Material in the Mozambique Channel can thus experience significant transport over long distances prior to deposition. Turbulent processes generated at the interfaces (e.g., internal waves) interacting with the continental slope / shelf may induce bottom current erosion, re-suspension, and redistribution of sediment (e.g., Dickson and McCave, 1986;Cacchione et al., 2002;Pomar et al., 2012;Shanmugam, 2013Shanmugam, , 2014. These mechanisms change slope morphology by steepening upslope and developing a terrace-like feature along the water mass interface (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2009;Preu et al., 2013). This sweep and winnow of the seafloor may also supply the nepheloid layers with sediment at the seaward limit of the terrace (Dickson and McCave, 1986;Puig et al., 2004;Wislon et al., 2015). Kolla et al. (1980) suggested that sedimentary waves on the Mozambican abyssal plain can result from very deep internal waves (e.g., van Haren and Gostiaux, 2011) focused on the nepheloid layer at the NADW / AABW interface between 3500 and 4500 m wd. Deposition occurs mainly in areas experiencing relatively low current velocities where settling of suspended particles can form contourite drifts (Miramontes et al., 2016;Cattaneo et al., 2017). Large-scale velocity variation in current pathways may reflect strong rotational current velocities (>70 cm/s) due to southward moving anticyclonic eddies (Ridderinkhof and de Ruijter, 2003) interacting with the Mozambican margin morphology (Dingle et al., 1987). Contourite drifts can also form from local reworking of the seafloor by bottom currents (e.g., 'horizontal eddies'). In this case, topography influences the velocity of the impinging water-mass and sediments deposit near the eroded source area (Rebesco and Camerlenghi, 2008). Coriolis forcing of northward currents towards the Mozambican margin (e.g., Faug\u00e8res and Mulder, 2011) can amplify this effect. In the depositional model for the Mozambique Channel described here, most present-day sedimentary processes and their morpho-sedimentary products result from bottom current processes. Observations from similar European and South American margins (Hern\u00e1ndez-Molina et al., 2011, 2016aErcilla et al., 2016;Preu et al., 2013) support this interpretation. Based on our results, two important aspects should be considered for improving this sedimentary model in the future. First, we show a dominance of across-slope gravity-driven processes operating along the northern sector of the Mozambican margin (Fig. 4). Slope and shelf areas associated with the northern sector experienced high rates of sediment than those located in the central and southern sectors (e.g., estimated present annual sedimentary input: 100\u202210 6 t from the Zambezi River; 4.8\u202210 6 t from the Limpopo River, Milliman, 1981). In the northern sector, high rates of sediment delivery beginning in the Pliocene and continuing up to present (Dingle et al., 1983;Walford et al., 2005;Franke et al., 2015)  and Green, 2016) led to a predominance of along-slope (contourite) processes. The northern sector, however reveals a combination of along-slope (i.e., T1 and D1) and across-slope (i.e., MTDs, turbidity currents) processes that may be related to sea-level fluctuations during glacial and inter-glacial periods (Wiles et al., 2017). During interglacial periods, sediments in front of the Zambezi River ('inner mud belt') are transported northward along the 'inner' shelf. Much of these sediments transfer through upper slope canyons of the Angoche SCS, few of these sediments are transported southward along the 'outer' shelf ('outer mud belt') toward the Middle and Lower Zambezi SCSs (Schulz et al., 2011;Wiles et al., 2017) (Fig. 4). This flux can be expected to have resulted in greater downslope transport (i.e., MTDs and turbidity currents) in front of the Angoche SCS than in front of the Middle and Lower Zambezi SCSs as it reached the shelf edge (Wiles et al., 2017) and may inhibit along-slope processes and their sedimentary features. Furthermore, shelf morphology (depth of the shelf-break, width of the shelf, etc.) during interglacial periods (such as in present-day,  is suitable for internal waves to propagate along the shelf edge, especially in front of the Middle and Lower Zambezi SCSs (DaSilva et al., 2009). Internal waves contributed to erosion, re-suspension, and redistribution of sediments along the upper slope, forming contourite terrace T1 and plastered drift D1 (e.g., Preu et al., 2013). During glacial periods, greater sediments supply and variation of the shelf morphology in front of the Middle and Lower Zambezi SCSs probably facilitate downslope sediment transport (Wiles et al., 2017) along the continental slope as well as preclude generation of internal waves. Further research can confirm or refute this hypothesis. Second, a particular deep plastered drift (D3) occurs over a specific water depth range in the transition zone between two water masses (AAIW and NADW) while upper plastered drifts (D2 and D3) match water depth ranges of water masses (SICW and AAIW) between density interfaces (pycnoclines) (e.g., Preu et al., 2013;Rebesco et al., 2014). However, the interpretation of D3 being generated in the transition zone between two water masses is questionable and it could be related to vertical movement of interfaces. The plastered drift formation is the result of processes acting on longer geological times. During the Quaternary, the Atlantic and Southwest Indian water-mass circulation and spatial fluctuations in water-mass interfaces may have been controlled by the Agulhas leakage (Hall et al., 2017) with less leakage during full glacial times than interglacial times (Peeters et al., 2004;Caley et al., 2012;Petrick et al., 2015). (CDW and AABW) to extend farther north than it does today (Bickert and Wefer, 1996;Pena and Goldstein, 2014). During cold (glacial) periods under this scenario, the oceanographic setting would differ from the present one and may have potentially provoked vertical and lateral variations of the interfaces and the associated oceanographic processes (e.g., internal waves), displacing drift D3 under the influence of deep Antarctic water masses. This interpretation is supported by Breitzke et al. (2017) suggesting that sedimentary waves under the water depth range of the NADW along the abyssal plain (Fig. 4) are draped with sediments. and contourite terraces identify in deep-environments (lower slope and basin floor) relate to the same water masses structure than observed today? The conditions and timing of their formation, remain still unresolved but future research should address these questions."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This work interpreted a number of large contourite deposits along the Mozambique Channel and their associated bottom currents and oceanographic processes. The oceanographic processes described act in combination to determine the bottom current's local direction and velocity. Although many of these processes and their effects on deep-water sedimentation are not fully understood, local or regional interaction of these processes with the seafloor influences morphology and sediment distribution along the Mozambican continental margin and adjacent Durban basin. This study came to fourth major conclusions: a) The first and most important finding is that internal waves originate from instabilities in the transition zone (interfaces / pycnoclines) between two water masses, caused by eddies, tidal and geostrophic currents being aided by topography. It provides the most plausible mechanism for sculpting contourite terraces (T1 to T4 in this study), facilitating erosion, re-suspension and redistribution of sediments (e.g., nepheloid layers). b) Second, weak along-slope bottom currents on the plastered drifts (D1 to D3) rarely exceed 12.5 cm/s and thus promote the settling of suspended particles. Growth of plastered drifts D1 and D2 is facilitated by weak along-slope bottom currents of two major water-masses circulating in the Mozambique Channel (i.e., SICW and AAIW) or a counteraction of such currents with periodic or a-periodic processes (e.g., eddies, deep water tidal currents), reducing current velocities. c) Third, the strengthening of along-slope bottom currents (e.g., Coriolis Effect, eddies, deep water tidal currents), being aided by seafloor irregularities would result in 'horizontal eddies'. Hence, these currents lead to erosion inside the moat and deposition on the elongated-mounded drift. Our study show that these drifts can develop inside the transition zone. Nevertheless, the finding in our study and limitations in the hydrodynamic modelling (e.g., secondary processes) point out a need for further studies, not only based on numerical simulations but also by field measurements (i.e., sedimentary cores and mooring scheme) to better quantify the impact of instabilities on contouritic depositional systems. d) The fourth finding is that the specific plastered drift D3 in our study area occurs in the transition zone between two water masses (AAIW and NADW), and forms on a much smaller lateral scale. This marks a major difference between the plastered drift investigated here and the existing paradigm that plastered drifts are often formed below water mass interfaces (such as D1 and D2). A possible explanation for that could be related to the fact that, through geological times, vertical movements of water masses and associated interfaces occurred, as reported in the south Atlantic by Preu et al. (2013), where the AABW was thicker, more vigorous and its top quite shallower during glacial stages compared with interglacial stages, as the present one. This hypothesis highlight new and important considerations: are all present morphologies in deep marine environment functional? Can some depositional and erosional features, especially in the deepest oceans, be relicts, being active under different oceanographic processes than the present ones?
