Participants have been followed up longitudinally since 2005. The last date of examination was October 15, 2013. Clinical follow-up between 6 and 96 months tracked progression to dementia.\nRegression and analysis of covariance analyses investigated relationships between pulse pressure and distinct cerebral spinal fluid biomarker profiles. Very old participants (80 years or older) were compared with younger participants (55-79 years of age) on clinical measures and pulse pressure \u00d7 age group interactions were investigated. Survival analysis examined the effect of baseline pulse pressure on progression to dementia. Covariates were age, sex, apolipoprotein E genotype, body mass index, vascular risk factors, and antihypertensive medication use.\nRESULTS Individuals with a P-tau-positive biomarker profile exhibited mean (SD) elevated pulse pressure regardless of age (62.0 [15.6] mm Hg for a P-tau-positive biomarker vs 57.4 [14.0] mm Hg for P-tau-negative biomarker; P = .04). In very old participants, a further increase in pulse pressure was observed in those exhibiting both P-tau elevation and \u03b2-amyloid 1-42 reduction vs either biomarkers alone (69.7 [16.0] mm Hg for both positive biomarkers vs 63.18 [13.0] mm Hg for P-tau alone vs 60.1 [16.4] mm Hg for \u03b2-amyloid 1-42 alone vs 56.6 [14.5] mm Hg for negative biomarkers; P = .003). Those with higher baseline pulse pressure progressed to dementia more rapidly (95% CI, 1.000-1.048; P = .05; hazard ratio = 1.024). Systolic pressure exhibited similar relationships with Alzheimer disease biomarkers and progression to dementia in the very old subgroup (P < .05) but showed no associations in the young old subgroup (P > .10). Diastolic pressure was reduced in young old participants with isolated phosphorylated tau elevation (P = .04).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Pulse pressure, an index of vascular aging, was associated with neurodegenerative change prior to the onset of dementia across a broad age range. Among those with more advanced age, higher pulse pressure was also associated with cerebral amyloidosis in the presence of neurodegeneration and more rapid progression to dementia. Diastolic contributions to these biomarker associations were limited to young old participants whereas systolic contributions were found only in very old participants."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "V ascular risk factors are well-established susceptibilities for Alzheimer dementia 1 but their exact role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease (AD) remains unclear.\n2 Several studies have demonstrated associations between AD biomarkers and markers of vascular aging and aortic stiffening, including brachial artery pulse pressure."}, {"section_title": "3-5", "text": "These findings suggest a direct link between vascular aging and AD pathophysiology during the earliest stages of the disease. A recent study found that markers of age-related arterial stiffening were associated with amyloid retention in very old adults (80 years of age and older), 6 a finding consistent with studies linking pulse pressure elevation to cognitive decline in this age group. 7, 8 Growing evidence indicates that although vascular pathology is highly prevalent in AD, 9, 10 it is even more common in the very old population, 11 suggesting that vascular aging may underlie or exacerbate the pathogenesis of AD in very old adults. Very old adults represent the fastest growing segment of the population at risk for dementia 12 ;\nhowever, less is known about AD in these individuals, making the further characterization of prodromal markers in this group an important area of research focus.\nWe hypothesized that vascular aging may play a substantial role in the pathogenesis of AD and that this would be most apparent in the very old participants compared with the young old participants. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between pulse pressure, a well-established and easily obtained marker of vascular aging, and both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-based AD biomarker profiles and progression to dementia in young old (55-79 years of age) vs very old (80-91 years of age) participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Study."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Data were obtained from the ADNI database (http://adni.loni .usc.edu).

Although there is no wellestablished cutoff for determining pulse pressure elevation, prior studies used a cutoff of more than 63 mm Hg owing to its association with poor cardiovascular prognosis. 16 Thus, post hoc \u03c7 2 analyses examined proportional differences in biomarker profiles between individuals with normal vs elevated pulse pressure using this cutoff. Multiple linear regression was used to determine continuous cross-sectional interactions and main effects for pulse pressure in association with biomarkers by age group. Cox regression investigated the relationship between baseline pulse pressure and progression to dementia using months to dementia diagnosis as the time variable.

Results in this larger sample confirmed those of our previous study, indicating that increased pulse pressure is associated with neurodegenerative changes prior to the onset of major cognitive dysfunction. 5 Previous studies have largely focused on associations between pulse pressure and amyloid markers, 3,4,6 although examination of individual biomarker values in isolation can be misleading owing to high intercorrelations among different biomarkers (eg, P-tau and A\u03b21-42). The present study was able to disentangle these associations to examine independent relationships between pulse pressure and specific CSF biomarker profiles. Findings indicated that pulse pressure was related primarily to P-tau elevation and its interaction with A\u03b21-42 reduction rather than A\u03b21-42 reduction itself.\nUntil recently, the prevailing model of preclinical AD has held that cerebral amyloidosis indexed by A\u03b21-42 reduction is the first event marking the preclinical stage of AD followed by subsequent neurodegenerative change indexed by P-tau elevation. 17, 18 However, previous work has called into question this sequence of events 19 because nearly one-quarter of older adults exhibit a profile of P-tau elevation in the absence of amyloidosis. 20 It is now recognized that AD neurodegeneration may not depend on prior amyloidosis. 21 The updated model indicates that neurodegeneration reflected as tau pathology may emerge independently and ahead of amyloid pathology and may be accentuated by the later development of amyloidosis. 22, 23 The association between pulse pressure and biomarker profiles observed in the present study was consistent with its potential role in this sequence of events. Findings from both linear regression and biomarker profile analyses agreed that the relationship between pulse pressure and A\u03b21-42 was only observed in the very old group and in participants whose test results were also P-tau positive. Pulse pressure elevation was associated with a 15% increase in the number of very old individuals exhibiting both A\u03b21-42 reduction and P-tau elevation. The very old participants were more likely to exhibit the A\u03b2+Ptau+ profile, displaying the highest pulse pressure in the sample, with a mean higher than 13 mm Hg compared with the biomarker negative group. Although we cannot conclude causality from these cross-sectional associations, findings support the possibility that vascular aging may play a role in the pathogenesis and/or progression of AD through an amyloid-independent relationship with neurodegeneration and also facilitate the interaction between amyloid and tau pathologies. This possibility is further supported by the fact that higher pulse pressure predicted a more rapid progression to dementia in the very old group, where for every 5-mm Hg increase in pulse pressure there was a 12% increase in the odds of progressing to dementia across a 5-month period. The Zlokovic 24 2-hit hypothesis states that vascular disease may influence AD pathophysiology through the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier leading to leakage of neurotoxic blood products into the parenchyma or through chronic hypoperfusion. These cerebrovascular abnormalities may directly cause neurodegeneration independent of cerebral amyloidosis, a hypothesis consistent with the findings of the present study. We previously reported that pulse pressure elevation in the context of reduced cerebral blood flow is associated with AD, cerebrovascular disease, and cognitive dysfunction 25 and that these findings are particularly salient in the very old population. 26 Together, these studies further support a potential role for chronic hypoperfusion. Future work is needed to further investigate these possible mechanisms linking agerelated vascular stiffening to neurodegeneration. It has also been hypothesized that pulse pressure elevation may impair A\u03b21-42 clearance through the disruption of paravascular drainage. 27 The present study findings suggest this mechanism may be primarily operating in individuals with very advanced age and ongoing neurodegenerative change. Thus, we speculate that pulsatile hemodynamics associated with advanced age may impair paravascular clearance of A\u03b21-42 in the context of an aged and inelastic cerebrovasculature. It remains unclear whether pulse pressure itself plays a causal role or whether pulse pressure elevation represents an indirect index of age-related cerebrovascular stiffness. The present study findings may also be consistent with the hypothesis that AD is characterized by a general failure to clear misfolded proteins, 23 with the greater-molecular weight proteins (P-tau) impacted at lower doses of pulse pressure and smaller proteins (A\u03b21-42) affected at higher doses. The pattern of associations observed between pulse pressure and T-tau was similar to that of P-tau but somewhat attenuated. Prior work has suggested that P-tau and T-tau similarly index AD neurodegeneration 15 ; however, it is also possible that T-tau levels may be more specific to axonal injury. 28 In this case, the observed relationships between pulse pressure and T-tau may be secondary to the previously described impact of pulsatile hemodynamics on white matter integrity. Although pulse pressure was the primary focus of the study, we examined systolic and diastolic pressure in relation to biomarkers to determine their contributions to the pulse pressure findings. Increased systolic blood pressure was associated with P-tau in the very old group but not the young old group while decreased diastolic pressure was associated with P-tau in the young old group but not the very old group. This pattern of results was consistent with the hypothesized relationship between vascular aging and neurodegeneration because low diastolic pressure and widening pulse pressure in the young old group was likely owing to the emergence of age-related arterial stiffening. In the very old group, low diastolic pressure may be more indicative of cardiac dysfunction and the prevalence of isolated systolic hypertension increases owing to continued arterial stiffening. 31 Finally, the pattern of associations between mean arterial pressure and biomarker profiles was similar to that of diastolic pressure in the young old group and systolic pressure in the very old group. This likely reflects the greater relative contributions of diastolic and systolic pressures to mean arterial pressure in the young old group and very old group, respectively. The present study focused on cross-sectional blood pressure values. Although higher blood pressure is associated with increased risk of dementia, there is actually a decline in blood pressure associated with the onset and progression of dementia.\n32 Thus, the relationship between relative changes in blood pressure and biomarker profiles may differ from findings related to the absolute blood pressure values reported in the present study. These differences may pertain to bidirectional effects of blood pressure and AD pathophysiology be A strength of the present study was the large sample size, which allowed for examination of independent associations between pulse pressure and specific biomarker profiles, as well as longitudinal clinical follow-up that allowed for the investigation of progression to dementia. Another strength was our ability to statistically control for a variety of potential confounds. The principal study limitations included the crosssectional and retrospective nature of the biomarker analyses. There was not a sufficient number of cases with serial biomarker data to generate biomarker profiles during the follow-up period. Future studies should investigate the relationship between blood pressure and biomarker profiles across time. We did note several clinicodemographic differences between our young old and very old age groups that should be considered in the interpretation of the study findings. Although we statistically controlled for relevant sample characteristics, the very old participants were more likely to be men and taking antihypertensive medications and less likely to be APOE-\u03b54 carriers or have type 2 diabetes mellitus. These demographic differences are atypical of those found in communitydwelling young old and very old adults and likely reflect ADNI sampling biases that may have differed substantially across the more than 50 centers contributing to the study. Additionally, ADNI inclusion/exclusion criteria yielded a sample with relatively low levels of cerebrovascular disease as well as other health issues. These considerations limit the generalizability the present study findings, suggesting that the replication of these results in a more representative community sample is warranted. An additional limitation was the uncontrolled and varying length of clinical follow-up in our progression to dementia analysis, although we did statistically control for this factor."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The present study findings underscore the importance of the vascular contribution to neurodegeneration in the very old population and suggest a potential relationship between vascular aging and both tau-mediated neurodegeneration and concomitant cerebral amyloidosis in this population.
