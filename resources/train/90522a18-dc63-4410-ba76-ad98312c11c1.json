Frail women had a higher mean BMI than prefrail and nonfrail women (28.4, 26.7 , and 24.5 kg/m 2 , respectively). Frail women also had a higher prevalence of chronic diseases such as osteoarthritis, coronary heart disease, hypertension, cancer , and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease compared with prefrail and nonfrail women, although the differences were not as large.\nOnly 27% of study participants had normal fasting glucose (<100 mg/dL) and normal glucose tolerance (2-hour glucose <140 mg/dL), whereas 48% had prediabetes, defi ned as impaired fasting glucose , impaired glucose tolerance , or both , and 25% had undiagnosed diabetes ( Table 2 ). The high prevalence of both prediabetes and diabetes was largely due to having an abnormal OGTT, with 71% of those with prediabetes and 78% of those with diabetes achieving these diagnoses exclusively due to presence of a high 2-hour glucose level.\nWhen the prevalence of each diabetes classifi cation was examined by frailty status, none of the frail women had both normal fasting and 2-hour values; all were classifi ed as having either prediabetes or diabetes. In addition, the prevalence of diabetes increased in a stepwise fashion by frailty status, with 12% of nonfrail, 23% of prefrail, and 56% of frail women classifi ed as having diabetes. We subsequently examined the average glucose and insulin dynamics during OGTT by frailty status. After 75 g oral glucose challenge ( Figure 1A ) , the frail group exhibited altered glucose dynamics, with both a delayed and higher peak and prolonged glucose levels relative to both the prefrail and the nonfrail groups. As shown in Figure 1B , the insulin dynamics largely paralleled those of glucose, with a more distinct and higher peak and prolonged insulin levels relative to prefrail and nonfrail groups. These fi ndings were consistent with our a priori hypotheses of altered glucoseinsulin dynamics in frail women.\nMean fasting glucose and insulin values did not differ by frailty status ( Table 1 and Figure 1 ) . Conversely, OGTT glucose levels at 120 minutes were higher in frail (222.9 \u00b1 23.4 mg/dL) versus prefrail (160.2 \u00b1 7.2 mg/dL) and nonfrail (155.3 \u00b1 15.2 mg/dL) women, whereas glucose levels at 60 and 180 minutes were also higher but differences were not as large. OGTT insulin levels were higher in frail women compared with their counterparts at 60, 120 , and 180 minutes as was integrated glucose area, integrated insulin area, and HOMA-IR, but these differences were not large . Although insulin sensitivity as assessed by Matsuda Index was lowest in frail women, the differences were not large compared with nonfrail and prefrail women.\nIn linear regression analyses adjusted for age and BMI, fasting and 30-minute glucose levels did not differ between frail and nonfrail women ( Table 3 ). In contrast, glucose levels were higher at 60 minutes (44.6 \u00b1 18.1 mg/dL higher) and 120 minutes (67.1 \u00b1 23.5 mg/dL higher) and to a lesser extent at 180 minutes (44.3 \u00b1 22.5 mg/dL higher) in frail versus nonfrail women. Glucose AUC was also higher (7128 \u00b1 3009 mg min \u2212 1 dL \u2212 1 higher) in frail versus nonfrail women. No \" large \" differences were noted between prefrail and nonfrail women in glucose levels at 0, 30, 60, 120 , or 180 minutes or glucose AUC.\nIn linear regression analyses adjusted for age and BMI, fasting insulin levels did not differ between frail and nonfrail women ( Table 3 ) . Conversely, insulin levels were higher at 120 minutes (45.7 \u00b1 22.4 \u03bc U/mL higher) in frail versus nonfrail women, whereas other OGTT insulin measurements, insulin AUC, HOMA-IR, and Matsuda index did not differ greatly between frail and nonfrail women. No differences were noted between prefrail and nonfrail women for insulin levels at any time point or insulin AUC.\nIn age-and BMI-adjusted robust regression analyses, 120-minute glucose levels remained higher in frail versus nonfrail women (55.5 \u00b1 21.8 mg/d L higher) as they did in adjusted sensitivity analyses excluding women with undiagnosed diabetes (47.7 \u00b1 20.5 mg/d L higher)."}, {"section_title": "D iscussion", "text": "Our data demonstrate that the prevalence of prediabetes (48%) and undiagnosed diabetes (25%) is extremely high in old -old women, largely manifested as an abnormal 2-hour OGTT glucose value. We also report that frailty was most strongly associated with the 2-hour OGTT glucose value in these women, robust even in sensitivity models, suggesting clinical meaningfulness to this testing abnormality. Our data support the value of glucose challenge testing to distinguish between physiologically frail women and their nonfrail or prefrail counterparts when basal unchallenged levels do not.\nThe high prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes in our study is consistent with nationally representative estimates ( 3 ). Overall, men and women aged 75 years and older in the United States have a similar prevalence of prediabetes (46.8%), though a lower prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes (13.4%), compared with our study. One explanation for the higher prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes in our study is the inclusion of frail individuals who ordinarily exclude themselves from research studies. Similar to our fi ndings, the 2-hour OGTT glucose level was better able to identify older participants with undiagnosed diabetes than the fasting glucose level in national surveys ( 3 ) . These data suggest that our high prevalence of abnormal 2-hour OGTT glucose levels was not simply due to high prior rates of fasting glucose screening by the participants ' physicians. Data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging also demonstrate an age-related increase in progression rate from normal glucose status to impaired glucose tolerance but not from normal glucose status to impaired fasting glucose ( 16 ) . Thus, greater OGTT testing would lead to a high prevalence of previously unrecognized prediabetes and diabetes in the older adults.\nAging is associated with impaired insulin sensitivity, with greater elevations seen in 2-hour glucose OGTT glucose values compared with fasting levels, although the presence of age-related differences in insulin secretion remain s unclear ( 1 , 2 , 17 -19 ) . Several studies further propose that the additional diabetes cases detected with OGTT in older adults are clinically relevant. In Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging , the 2-hour OGTT glucose was associated with better mortality risk prediction than fasting glucose alone ( 2 , 20 ) with similar fi ndings in CHS with respect to incident cardiovascular events ( 21 ) . Taken together, these data suggest that the 2-hour glucose level predicts adverse events in older people and may warrant the additional inconvenience of OGTT administration.\nOur fi ndings of frailty being associated with higher 2-hour OGTT glucose levels in individuals without diabetes are consistent with those from CHS in which frailty was associated with the 2-hour, but not the fasting, glucose level in men and women without diabetes ( 8 ) . Few other studies have investigated associations between abnormal glucose status and frailty. Hyperglycemia, measured by hemoglobin A1c, is associated with a higher likelihood of frailty ( 9 ) . Insulin resistance is associated with incident frailty; for every standard deviation increment in HOMA-IR, the adjusted hazard ratio for frailty was 1.15 (95% CI : 1.02 -1.31) ( 10 ) . Individuals who eventually developed frailty were also more likely, in parallel, to develop diabetes compared with older adults who never developed frailty (8.6% vs 4.2%). Thus, the association between frailty and abnormal glucose status may be bidirectional though more longitudinal studies are needed.\nThe underlying physiological mechanisms relating frailty and abnormal glucose status are not fully understood. One hypothesis is that infl ammatory pathways may be the link. Frail older adults have a higher burden of Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article-abstract/67/12/1300/605270 by guest on 02 August 2018 infl ammatory markers ( 8 ) , which are also associated with insulin resistant states ( 22 ) . An alternative hypothesis is that the conditions are related through a primary defect in muscle metabolism. In older adults, skeletal muscle protein synthesis may be resistant to the anabolic action of insulin ( 23 ) . Insulin resistance is also associated with activation of muscle proteolysis (ie , ubiquitin) pathways ( 24 ) . Both processes likely contribute to the muscle loss inherent in the frailty phenotype. In turn, reduced muscle surface area for insulin-mediated glucose uptake may then aggravate peripheral insulin resistance, leading to a vicious cycle. Further more , elevated infl ammatory markers are also associated with muscle loss ( 25 ) . Thus, insulin resistance, infl ammation, and muscle loss may represent related processes that manifest as the phenotype of frailty in a vulnerable subset of older adults.\nAltered glucose dynamics in frailty was previously described in frail older adults who underwent a meal test and had a more exaggerated and prolonged glucose response after 2 hours compared with nonfrail older adults ( 26 ) . We observed a more exaggerated and prolonged response for both glucose and insulin in our study. The meal test contains 32 g of carbohydrate and is likely not as potent a stimulus as the 75 g offered in our study.\nAlthough surrogate indices of insulin sensitivity (Matsuda) and resistance (HOMA-IR and insulin AUC) were not statistically signifi cantly different by frailty status, the exaggerated insulin dynamics observed in our study support the presence of insulin resistance in frailty. Interestingly, one study found that only frail obese, but not frail lean adults, had reduced insulin sensitivity versus nonfrail counterparts ( 11 ) . In contrast, although the frail women in our study had higher mean BMI, we still found significantly higher 2-hour insulin levels in frail women compared with their counterparts in adjusted analyses. Our results suggest that altered glucose -insulin dynamics in frailty are independent of differences in BMI.\nTo our knowledge, this is the largest study of oral glucose tolerance testing in women older than 80 years that also investigates associations with frailty status. We were uniquely able to include women of this age group for our study because of the commitment they had already demonstrated to the Women ' s Health and Aging Study II study, sustained for more than 15 years, and the use of home visits. However, limitations to our study include the number of study participants. The frail women composed a relatively small subgroup , which may affect our ability to discern statistically signifi cant differences, for instance, in the prevalence of chronic comorbidities by frailty status , although observed differences could be clinically meaningful. Consequently, confi rmation of our fi ndings in other studies is needed. Other limitations include performance in women only, limiting our ability to generalize to frailty in men , and the cross-sectional nature of our data, which limits inferences on temporality.\nIn summary, our study has both clinical and physiologic implications. From the clinical standpoint, our data build on existing literature to suggest that higher 2-hour glucose levels, even within the nondiabetic range, are associated with adverse consequences in older persons. From the physiologic standpoint, we provide the fi rst evidence that glucose -insulin dynamics after OGTT (v s fasting levels) are different in frail women compared with their counterparts, supporting the notion that challenge testing may best identify individuals with decreased physiological reserve. Future studies should examine the timing and relationship of these glucose -insulin abnormalities with respect to the pathogenesis of frailty, as well as their associations with dysregulation in other physiologic systems."}]
