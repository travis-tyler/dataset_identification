[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objective: The goal of this study is to identify risk factors for the presence of amyloid accumulation in the brains of patients reporting subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Identifying such risk factors will help better identify patients who ought to receive neuroimaging studies to confirm plaque presence and begin intervention, as well as enhancing the study of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Methods: Ninety-nine SCD participants (72.2 \u00b1 5.6 years, 57.6% female) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) underwent florbetapir PET. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between the presence of an increased amyloid signal (amyloid positivity) and several potential risk factors, including: demographics, APOE \u03b54 genotype, family history of dementia, history of hypertension, history of cigarettes smoking, cognitive function and depressive symptoms. Results: Being female was a significant risk factor for amyloid positivity (OR = 4.915, 95% CI = 1.709-14.139), as was being an APOE \u03b54 carrier (OR = 2.985, 95% CI = 1.084-8.219) and having a history of cigarette smoking (OR = 4.091, 95% CI = 1.483-11.285). Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that female gender, APOE \u03b54 genotype, and history of cigarettes smoking are associated with amyloid positivity in patients with SCD."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) [1] , also known as significant memory concern (SMC), is a self-perceived cognitive decline in the absence of objective cognitive impairment. This is commonly reported by older people, but may reflect an internal appreciation of loss of function which the patient is able to adequately compensate for on testing. Emerging evidence supports the notion that SCD may be a harbinger of future progression into clinically observable states of impairment; namely, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia [2] [3] [4] . Recent studies have also suggested that SCD is related with increased amyloid accumulation [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] , although some inconsistencies exist [11, 12] . As amyloid appears to be the initial driver in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) [13] , the identification of amyloid positive subjects is critical for the clinical trials, especially those with amyloid-modifying therapies. Secondary prevention trials are also being conducted in amyloid-positive individuals with SCD; in these trials, documentation of amyloid status is indispensable for enrollment.\nIt is estimated that the prevalence of amyloid positivity in SCD individuals ranges from 12% to 43% [14] , which may be affected by age and genetic background. Current methods such as CSF protein analysis and amyloid neuroimaging are not feasible at the large scale necessary to identify sufficient numbers of eligible subjects for clinical trials. Thus, identifying factors which strongly predict amyloid positivity in SCD would facilitate the process of clinical trial recruitment and provide a useful tool for studying AD pathogenesis. Although risk factors related with amyloid accumulation have been extensively reported in cognitively normal and cognitively impaired individuals [15] [16] [17] , the risk factors for the unique category of patients reporting SCD, but testing normally, have not been well-studied. Thus, our current study aimed to examine, in patients reporting SCD, the relationship between amyloid positivity and the following relevant risk factors: demographics, APOE \u03b54 genotype, family history of dementia, history of hypertension, history of cigarettes smoking, cognitive function and depressive symptoms."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ADNI dataset", "text": "Cross-sectional data used in the preparation of this paper were extracted from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu) during January 2017.

Our findings showed that female gender, APOE \u03b54 genotype and history of cigarette smoking were associated with amyloid positivity among individuals with SMC.\nWe found sex differences in amyloid burden among SMC individuals, with more amyloid positivity in females. Some epidemiologic studies have suggested that females have a higher prevalence [23] and incidence [24] of AD, and our data indicate that sex may contribute to AD pathogenesis through amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) dependent pathway. In line with our findings, previous animal studies have shown that females have more amyloid deposition than their male counterparts [25, 26] , providing direct evidence that sex differences in amyloid accumulation may play the critical role in AD pathogenesis. However, in human postmortem studies, the results were conflicting and inconclusive [27, 28] , and these discrepant findings may be due to, at least in part, the fact that several potential confounding factors, like age, education, APOE \u03b54 genotype and cardiovascular risk factors, were not adequately adjusted. Recent study using amyloid neuroimaging suggested that females deposit more amyloid in the brain than males in a community-based cohort without dementia [29] , although some inconsistencies exist here as well [14, 30] . Further study is needed to elucidate the exact relationship between sex and amyloid pathology.\nAs expected, we found that the presence of APOE \u03b54 genotype increased the odds of amyloid positivity among SMC individuals. Being homozygous for APOE \u03b54 appears to be the largest genetic risk factor for AD [31] , and our findings suggest that this correlates with amyloid accumulation even in SMC. Previous animal studies have demonstrated that the impacts of APOE \u03b54 on amyloid-\u03b2 aggregation [32, 33] and clearance [34] may play the critical role in the AD pathogenesis, which is in line with our findings. Additionally, results of neuropathological studies in AD patients indicated that APOE \u03b54 carriers possessed elevated levels of A\u03b2, A\u03b2 oligomers and plagues depositions in the brain [35] [36] [37] . Neuroimaging studies have also shown that APOE \u03b54 genotype portends increased amyloid accumulation both in cognitively normal older people [38] and in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients [39] , although studies in AD subjects have yielded contradictory results [39, 40] . Further, studies have suggested that APOE \u03b54 carriers possess more amyloid burden than APOE \u03b54 non-carriers among SMC individuals [18, 41] . Findings from brain imaging studies and animal models indicate that blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction may precede onset of neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of AD [42] . Emerging evidence shows that APOE play a critical role in the maintenance of BBB integrity in an isoform dependent manner and that lack of APOE results in BBB breakdown [43, 44] . In comparison with APOE \u03b53 knock-in mice, BBB permeability is elevated in APOE \u03b54 knock-in mice [43, 44] . By activating a proinflammatory CypA-nuclear factor-kB-matrix-metalloproteinase-9 pathway in pericytes, investigators found that APOE \u03b54 knock-in mice, but not APOE \u03b52 and APOE \u03b53, have a damaged BBB [44] . Importantly, BBB breakdown also leads to impaired amyloid-\u03b2 clearance, and oligaemia in turn increases amyloid-\u03b2 production [45] . Taken together, our findings are largely consistent with APOE \u03b54 literature, supporting the notion that APOE \u03b54 may result in decreased amyloid-\u03b2 clearance and thus enhance the development of AD. In this study, history of cigarettes smoking was found to be associated with increased amyloid burden in SMC individuals. This finding was consistent with in vitro [46] , animal model [47] , human postmortem [48] and epidemiological studies [49] demonstrating that smokers have significantly increased amyloid pathology and risk of AD. However, the exact mechanisms by which smoking exerts its detrimental effect in AD remain elusive. Several potential pathways may be involved, including smoking related oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, altered mitochondrial respiratory chain function induced by some cigarettes combustion products, dysfunction of the proteostasis machinery, impairments of blood-brain barrier (BBB) and so on. Further investigations are needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms by which smoking affects the pathophysiology of AD.\nOur findings should be interpreted with caution because the study sample was relatively small; thus, further investigations with larger sample size are needed to increase the statistical power to elucidate the exact relationship between these factors and amyloid positivity. While our study could not provide this level of granularity, the relationship between these risk factors and differential accumulation of amyloid across brain regions would be of great interest. Further study will be needed to clarify this association.\nIn conclusion, our findings revealed that female gender, APOE \u03b54 genotype and history of cigarettes smoking were associated with amyloid positivity among individuals with SMC.
