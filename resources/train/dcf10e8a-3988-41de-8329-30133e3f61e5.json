[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "An increasing number of extremely warm summer heatwaves have occurred since 2000 (Sch\u00e4r et al 2004, Sparnocchia et al 2006, Barriopedro et al 2011, Karl et al 2012 in several regions globally. Atmospheric heat wave (AHW) frequency has likely increased in Europe, Asia and Australia since about 1950 (Perkins and Alexander 2013). The number of marine heatwave (MHW) days globally has increased 54% since the early 20 th century, based on the definition of Hobday et al (2016), with an increase of 0.3-0.9 days per year in the New Zealand region (Oliver et al 2018). AHWs and MHWs are caused by specific atmospheric and oceanic factors or by a combination of both. For AHWs blocking high pressure systems are a predominant driver (Brunner et al 2016), while for MHWs oceanic heat advection can be a driver (Oliver et al. 2017). The frequency and intensity of such heat extremes are influenced by anthropogenic global warming (AGW; Otto et al 2012, Kharin et al 2013 with more frequent and more intense heat extremes expected as average temperatures rise. Impacts of such heat extremes are significant and diverse, ranging from coral bleaching (Hughes et al 2003), to migration of marine species (Poloczanska et al 2016) to human mortality rates (Barriopedro et al 2011). Terrestrial impacts of AHWs are very significant as in Europe in 2003 where drought caused an estimated 30% reduction in gross primary production, many large wildfires, and extreme glacier melt in the European Alps (Kosatsky 2005). Individual AHWs and MHWs have been investigated in terms of their characterization and physical drivers (Sch\u00e4r et al 2004, Benthuysen et al 2014, marine impacts, and the role of AGW (Oliver et al 2018). This study examines the 2017/18 New Zealand coupled regional AHW and MHW from observations and ocean models. It diagnoses both the atmospheric and oceanic drivers and investigates atmospheric diagnostics. The event is described from observational data sets combined with ocean modelling. The event is discussed as an analogue for projected conditions later in the 21 st century (Mullan et al 2016)."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Observations of atmosphere and ocean surface temperature The New Zealand air temperature (NZT) series (Mullan et al 2010) was used to calculate mean air temperature anomalies from the 1981-2010 normal. From 1940/41 to 2017/18 climate extremes for TX90p (percentage of days when the daily maximum temperature is above the 90 th percentile) and TN90p (percentage of days when the daily minimum temperature is above the 90 th percentile) were calculated using the ClimPACT2 software (Alexander and Herold 2015). Eight stations were analysed for the 1934/35 event. Summer days \u226525\u00baC, were analysed for the Virtual Climate Station Network (VCSN), where climate variables, are interpolated onto a 4km by 5km grid over New Zealand (Tait et al 2006). Counts of days of \u226525\u00b0C were made for each New Zealand region using VCSN for DJF from 1972/73 to 2017/18, and for station data for the length of record, invariably 45 years or more. Monthly sea surface temperature (SST) observations were obtained from ERSST version 5 (Huang et al 2017), which provides monthly SSTs on a 2\u00b0\u00d7 2\u00b0 latitude/longitude grid from 1854. Monthly SST was averaged over the region 140\u00baE to 150\u00baW and 60\u00baS to the Equator and SST anomalies within this box were calculated with respect to the 1981-2010 period. Daily SST estimates obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OI SST) V2 product (Reynolds et al 2007), provides daily SSTs on a 0.25\uf0b0 latitude/longitude grid spanning September 1981-May 2018. A daily resolution of SST time series for the eastern Tasman Sea was generated by averaging daily SSTs over the region 160-175\u00b0E and 36-48\u00baS. Daily 9 am measurements of SST since 1953 were obtained from the Portobello Marine Laboratory (PML) time-series, in Otago Harbour, southeast South Island (Greig et al 1988). Half-hourly measurements of water temperature at 2 m and 10 m depth spanning summer 2017/18 were obtained on the open coast in a kelp forest 20km north of the Otago Harbour. A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t MHW definition and metrics Hobday et al (2016) definitions were applied to identify MHWs based on daily SST measurements from the OISSTv2, PML datasets, and hindcast model output. This is when mean SSTs exceed a the 90th percentile for at least 5 consecutive days, and with well-defined start and end times. Daily climatological mean and 90th percentile values were calculated over a 30-year baseline period (September 1981 -August 2011) for each day of the year using all SST data within an 11-day window. The time series were smoothed with a 31-day moving window. The warming during each MHW was characterized using the following metrics: duration (continuous period that SSTs exceed the 90th percentile value), maximum and mean intensity (the maximum and mean daily SST anomaly during each MHW). SST anomalies were calculated relative to the 1981-2011 daily average."}, {"section_title": "Atmospheric circulation", "text": "Monthly mean sea level pressure (MSLP) and 500-hPa geopotential height fields were obtained from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis (Kalnay et al 1996), and from the ERA-Interim reanalysis (Dee et al 2011).

Atmospheric circulation patterns were compared using anomaly correlation and root mean-square difference over the region 135\u00b0E-140\u00b0W, 65\u00b0S-25\u00b0S.

Temperature anomalies were calculated by differencing the Argo profiles and co-located temperature profiles from the CARS 2009 climatology (Ridgway et al 2002, based on all available data in the region prior to 2009). The eastern Tasman region was chosen because it was an area of strong SST change during this event and is oceanographically uniform, excluding strong gradients and variability associated with the Subtropical Front to the south, the Tasman Front to the north and the East Australian Current (EAC) to the west.

Ocean physics have been simulated with the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO, Madec 2008) model using the recent released (3.6. stable) code version. Sea-ice has been modelled, using the Community Ice CodE (CICE, Hunke et al 2017). Atmospheric boundary conditions to force this ocean-only configuration are based on the atmospheric reanalysis product JRA-55-DO v1.3 (Tsujino et al 2018) and the ocean hindcast covers the period from 1958 until February 2018. The fully coupled version of this model (HadGEM3-GC3.1) has been shown to perform well against key metrics in a pre-industrial model setup (Menary et al 2018). Mixed layer depths have been defined as depths where the difference to surface density exceeds 0.01 kg/m\u00b3. Thermocline depths describe the depth where the vertical temperature gradient maximum is located. The anomalies presented in Fig. 3 are computed by subtracting a monthly mean climatology, constructed over the period 1968-2017. The definition of MHW follows Hobday et al (2016).

To extend the EOSS for the Southern Alps (EOSSAlps) and for the Tasman Glacier (EOSSTas), glacier volume changes were calculated for the period 1962-2018 using the methodology described by Chinn et al (2012). Independent EOSSTas measurements from snow surveys of the Tasman Glacier were used to extend the established EOSSAlps record to 1962 (Anderton 1975, Chinn 1968, 1969, since the two are strongly correlated (r 2 = 0.91). Linear regression analysis was used to estimate EOSSAlps for the period 1962-1976, then merged with the documented EOSSAlps record through to 2017 (Willsman et al 2018). For 2018, EOSSTas was assessed using a time series of SENTINEL-2 satellite images from 14 March 2018 (NZDT), then converted to EOSSAlps using the regression relationship described above. An alternative estimate of Southern Alps glacier mass balance comes from glacier-wide albedo observations at Brewster Glacier using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, Sirguey et al 2016) imagery, which has been correlated to a record of glacier mass balance (Cullen et al 2017). The Brewster Glacier EOSS is strongly correlated with EOSSAlps (r 2 =0.85). Estimates of water stored as seasonal snow in the South Island for 2017-18 are provided by a conceptual model (SnowSim) originally developed for the electricity industry Garr 1995, Kerr 2005). This model calculates water stored as seasonal snow for key hydro generating river catchments and is tuned to their long-term water balance.

It covered an area of around 4 million km 2 , equivalent to that of the Indian sub-continent. For DJF 2017/18, both land-surface air temperatures were 2\uf0b0C or more above 1981-2010 averages over the entire New Zealand region, from 35 to 50\u00baS, 150 to 180\u00baE (Fig 1a, 1c, 1d). There was a huge loss of snow and ice in the Southern Alps ( Fig. 4). On land, wine-grape v\u00e9raison and maturation was very advanced (Fig. 5). Marine environmental impacts saw the appearance of marine species normally found farther north, with impacts on farmed salmon and kelp (Morton 2018, Lewis 2018). There were slightly more named tropical cyclones (TCs) than normal over the southwest Pacific and an increase in extratropical transition of TCs around or towards New Zealand Fig. 2b, 2c), compared to averages reported by Diamond et al (2013) and Diamond and Renwick (2015). Land and ocean time series show that the entire New Zealand region was the warmest observed. NZT anomalies were 2.2\u00baC above average ( Fig. 1a and Table 2), the warmest on record (Salinger 1979, 1980, Mullan et al 2010. Indices of temperature extremes for New Zealand ( Fig. 1b and Table 2) show the highest percentage of summer warm days and warm nights above the 90 th percentile (35% and 31% respectively) back to 1941. Counts of summer days \u226525\u00baC were the highest recorded, back to 1973. For the Tasman Sea (26\u00ba-48\u00b0S, 150\u00ba-174\u00b0E) SSTs were 1.5\u00baC above average (Fig. 1c), the largest anomaly on record. The biggest departures from average occurred in January, with the entire Tasman Sea/New Zealand region having a DJF anomaly of around 2\u00baC (Fig. 1d). Based on both atmospheric and ocean metrics, the summer 2017/18 heatwave was the most intense on recorddating back to 1909 for NZT and 1981 for the satellite SST record. The heatwave over land developed in October and November 2017 where NZT were 1.0 and 1.1\u00baC above average respectively ( Fig. 1a). December 2017 was warmer (2.4\u00baC) and the heatwave peaked in January 2018 with an NZT anomaly of 3.2\u00baC, the warmest month ever recorded. During February the event abated (NZT +0.9\u00baC). SSTs followed a similar temporal pattern ( Fig.  1e-f). Applying a MHW definition (Hobday et al 2016) to daily satellite SSTs from the eastern Tasman Sea, the MHW had a duration of 147 days from 14 November 2017 to 9 April 2018 ( Fig.1g), a maximum intensity of 3.7\u00baC (Fig.1h), and a mean intensity of 2.1\u00baC (not shown, see Methods for a description of the MHW metrics). Daily SSTs from a long-term monitoring site at the PML indicated that summer 2017/18 was the warmest on record, since 1953 ( Fig. 1f, 1j). The DJF average temperature (anomaly) at PML was 17.8\u00baC (2.4\u00baC), 0.6\u00baC warmer than the previous record set in 1974/1975. Near-shore surface waters at PML were in an MHW state over four distinct periods from October 2017 to March 2018 ( Fig. 1f). Of these, the 28-day period from 22 November to 20 December 2017 was the most intense MHW on record at PML, with a maximum (mean) intensity of 5.7\u00baC ( Fig.1j) and a mean intensity of 3.4\u00baC (not shown). The only other time a New Zealand coupled ocean-atmosphere heatwave of similar magnitude occurred was in 1934/35. That summer was described at the time as \"remarkably warm\" (Kidson 1935) with a New Zealand-average mean temperature of 18.5\u00baC, 2.7\u00baC above the climatological normal of the day , and 1.9\u00baC above the 1981-2010 normal (Mullan et al 2010). TX90p and TN90p were 30 and 29% respectively. There was an accompanying MHW (not analysed by Kidson 1935) which developed in November 1934, became most intense in January 1935, then slowly abated. From ERSSTv5 data (Huang et al 2017), SST anomalies were 1\u00baC above average for the entire season surrounding New Zealand, and 2\uf0b0C off the west coast of the South Island (not shown)."}, {"section_title": "Atmospheric and oceanic circulation anomalies", "text": "Atmospheric circulation anomalies for the season (Fig. 2a) show a pattern of blocking (higher than normal pressures) to the east and southeast of New Zealand, with negative pressure anomalies to the northwest of New Zealand. Over austral spring 2017 and summer 2017/2018 El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was in a weak La Ni\u00f1a phase with a Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) of +0.9 in spring, and +0.0 in summer. This would on average promote a tendency towards northerly quarter airflow anomalies in spring, and northeasterly airflow anomalies over New Zealand in summer (Gordon 1986). The SAM was positive (spring +0.99, summer +1.73) A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t especially in November (+3.2) and January (+2.7). The resultant airflow anomalies ( Fig. 2a) match well with the phases of ENSO and the SAM, with the contraction of the southern westerlies towards Antarctica. The regional Trenberth circulation indices are consistent with a prevalence of northeasterly flow for the season, with negative values of both M1 and Z1 indices. . New Zealand weather types show a predominance of the Block regime (observed 54.7%+17.6%), and lack of the Zonal regime (6.6%, -18.5%) for DJF with frequent low wind situations. (Fig. 3a-c). The Trough regime occurrence was near normal (38.6%, +0.8%). TC behaviour during the 2017/18 season was consistent with positive SOI and SAM conditions (Diamond and Renwick 2015). There was a total of eight named TCs for the full season; the 7 late season (Feb-Apr) named TCs over the southwest Pacific (Fig. 2b) were close to the expected number (6) for a late season La Ni\u00f1a period (Diamond et al 2013). The season's conditions may have led to an increased extratropical transition of tropical cyclones around or towards New Zealand; such a TC anomaly pattern (Fig. 2c) is consistent with both the La Ni\u00f1a and positive SAM state (Diamond and Renwick 2015). The GODAS sub-surface ocean temperature pattern for DJF for 40-45\u00baS ( Fig. 2d) indicates very shallow anomalies to the west of the South Island, with a narrow band down to about 50 m east of the South Island. Argo float measurements ( Fig. 2e) averaged over the eastern Tasman Sea confirmed a strong surface warming starting in December, peaking with a 3\u00baC mean anomaly over this eastern Tasman region. The anomaly decreased through February-April.

A total of 10 ERA-Interim and 11 NCEP-I analogues were found which met threshold correlation and RMSD values as documented in Table 1a. Threemonth average SOI and SAM indices were calculated for each analogue period and compared to values observed in DJF 2017/18. Both reanalyses produced very similar results in terms of SOI and SAM statistics (Table 1b). All were associated with prominent anticyclonic anomalies of up to 60 geopotential metres (gpm) centred to the southeast of New Zealand (not shown). The positive anomalies covered an area from 25-60\u00baS, 155\u00baE-155\u00baW.

The 95% significance level of SAM and SOI values for these cases is 1.63 and 0.76 respectively, based on the analogue cases in Table 1a.

In January the MHW weakened but still covered most of the Tasman Sea (Fig. 3d-f). The mixed layer (Fig. 3g-i) and thermocline depth (Fig. 3j) became significantly shallower (~10m and ~40m), due to the decrease in wind speeds over this period (Fig. 3a-c) as suggested by the MSLP anomalies. Wind speeds were around 0.5 ms -1 lower than normal during the season over the Tasman Sea, with climatological values in the order of 6-7 m s -1 , reflecting a drop of around 30%. The consequence was anomalous low vertical mixing and surface warming, while the broader oceanic heat content was not affected. Area averages over the Tasman Sea (Fig. 3j) suggest that NDJ wind speeds were a record low, while surface heat fluxes were in the normal range.

Between 1962 and 2018 the volume of ice in the Southern Alps decreased from an estimated 60.5 to 37.3 km 3 w.e., with the 23.2 km 3 w.e. change equal to a 38% loss of ice. The summer heat wave in 2017/2018 was responsible for a 9% reduction in total ice volume in the Southern Alps compared to the previous year (2016/17). The estimate for glacier loss in 2017/2018 was compared to an approach using MODIS observations of surface albedo at Brewster Glacier, which yielded a Southern Alps ice volume loss of 3.1\u00b10.7 km w.e. MODIS albedo observations revealed the fast and uninterrupted depletion of the winter snowpack compared to the long-term trend (Fig. 4b), leading to an early exposure of glacier ice in mid-December 2017. Surface albedo decayed further (lowest since 2000) and the snowline rose to a level close to or above the altitude of the highest point on the glacier. The minimum albedo corresponded to an annual surface mass balance value of -2.2 m w.e. on Brewster Glacier, which is the most negative surface mass balance value since 1977. During the 2017-18 snow year, the SnowSim model (Fig. 4c) showed that the estimated water stored as seasonal snow leading up to August and from mid-December 2018 was the lowest on record. From mid-January it became 'negative', indicating all the seasonal snow had melted, with extraordinary loss of permanent glacier snow and ice.

Summer temperature departures for 2017/18 compared best with end-of-century changes under RCP4.5 or RCP6.0, where mean annual temperatures increase by 1.4\u00baC or 1.8\u00baC, respectively by 2081-2100 (Table 6, Mullan et al 2016). We recognize that 2017/18 is a single-season transient extreme event, whereas conditions in the 2090s (2081-2100 average) under future scenarios are closer to a nearequilibrium state. The scenario changes in managed ecosystems and marine ecology are expected to be in the same direction as seen in 2017/18, but the changes could be larger if the drivers are consistent year after year. Larger changes are likely for slow-response components of the New Zealand climate system, such as the South Island glaciers."}, {"section_title": "Discussion and Conclusions", "text": "Most global land areas have experienced more heatwaves since the mid-20th century (Donat et al 2013). Only recently have MHWs been assessed (Oliver et al 2018) and very few studies have examined coupled ocean-atmosphere heatwaves, one such example being that of Olita et al (2007) of the Mediterranean in 2003. The unprecedented heatwave in the 2017/18 New Zealand summer (DJF) was such a combined AHW/MHW event. It was the most intense on record with a maximum AHW anomaly of +3.2\u00baC, and MHW anomaly of +3.7\u00baC. The heatwave covered all the land area, the entire central and south Tasman Sea and across to 180\u00baE in the southwest Pacific Ocean, an area of 4 million km 2 . The event was discernible in monitored surface air temperatures, daily remotely-sensed SSTs, nearshore temperature loggers, GODAS and Argo float measurements. Slightly more named TCs than normal occurred in the southwest Pacific, with an above average number of extratropical transitions towards and around New Zealand. The ocean modelling analyses suggest, that a general lack of vertical mixing due to exceptional low winds during this period was the main driver for this MHW event, while earlier studies found that heat advection have triggered previous events in the Tasman Sea (Oliver et al 2017). Likely climate drivers are depicted qualitatively in Fig. 6, with the role of AGW highlighted. Recent research using climate models by Perkins-Kirkpatrick et al (2018) suggests that the 2017/18 MHW would have been \"virtually impossible\" without anthropogenic influence. However, the statistics from the 1934/35 event indicate it has occurred in the past in the observed record and was only 0.3\u00baC cooler. If AGW is adjusted for, it was in effect 0.2\u00baC warmer. Projected changes of pressure and wind for the late 21 st century from climate models (Mullan et al 2016) show MSLP increases in the DJF period, especially to the south-east of New Zealand. The airflow becomes more north-easterly, and at the same time associated with more (possibly blocking) A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t anticyclones. AGW also produces a trend towards the SAM being more positive resulting in higher MSLPs in the New Zealand region, and a contraction of the southern westerlies poleward, however this trend will likely be countered over the coming several decades by stratospheric ozone recovery (Arblaster et al 2011). The New Zealand DJF heatwave shows all these features ( Fig. 6), with increased MSLP mainly from the SAM together with the oceanic and atmospheric drivers of ENSO in a weak La Ni\u00f1a phase. This produced very prominent positive height anomalies at the 500-hPa level with positive anomalies of up to 60 gpm centred to the southeast of New Zealand. The atmospheric circulation anomalies were associated with very low wind speeds, around 2 ms -1 lower than normal during the season. Ocean model simulations suggest this caused anomalous low vertical mixing and initiated ocean surface warming, although the broader oceanic heat content was not affected. While surface heat fluxes were normal, the lack of vertical mixing caused the SSTs to exceed previous records and led to increased temperature anomalies. The heatwave was over land and oceanic areas, with significant impacts on the terrestrial environment and marine ecosystems. Tasman glacier snowline estimates show the highest EOSSTas on record. An estimated record 3.8\u00b10.6 km 3 w.e. loss of ice occurred, the largest estimated annual volume loss of permanent ice in the Southern Alps for the last 57 years and a 9% reduction compared to the previous year. Seasonal snow storage leading up to August and from mid-December 2018 was the lowest on record. From mid-January it became \"negative\", indicating all seasonal snow and some long-term ice had melted. For Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc wine grapes the 2018 season proved to be amongst the warmest since 1947, with v\u00e9raison and maturation dates advanced by 13 and 17 days respectively. Unprecedented breaches of physiological temperature thresholds for habitat forming kelp and observations of out-of-range occurrence of tropical and warm temperate fish species suggest broader impacts on marine ecosystems. Finally, we have examined the intensity of the warming, and extreme surface air temperatures to provide a future analogue for summer climate scenarios for 2081-2100 for impact studies. The statistics of the anomalies and extremes match well with the RCP4.5 or RCP6.0 summer climate projections for the New Zealand region. Our approach has been applied in near-real time as the event developed in the oceanic Southern Hemisphere. This contrasts with previous studies, which have separately examined AHW and MHW events (Sparnocchia et al 2006, Barriopedro et al 2011, and their physical drivers and mechanisms (Oliver et al 2018), and impacts (Benthuysen et al 2014). This also provides a useful analogue for future AGW in the region. In doing so we utilized ocean modelling to diagnose physical drivers and pioneered the use of satellite remote sensing to track glacier ice volume loss for the Southern Alps. We note the importance of long-term observation records as well as remote-sensing observing systems to track the evolution of both AHW and MHW events. This multidisciplinary work has shown that regional heatwaves can develop rapidly and have widespread impacts on ecosystems. It would be valuable for the approach taken here to utilize both atmospheric and oceanic seasonal to interannual climate forecasting systems (Salinger et al 2016) to become part of a scheme that could provide alerts on the emergence and evolution of regional heatwaves. Under the more extreme RCP8.5 scenario, the observed 2017/18 heatwave anomalies would become typical much earlier in the century. A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t Table 2.
