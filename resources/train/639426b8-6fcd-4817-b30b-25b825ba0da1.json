AD is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Many genetic loci exist that modify AD risk, but collectively, they explain only a fraction of AD's heritability [2] and are not diagnostically useful [3, 4] . Rare variants with large effects and epistatic interactions may account for much of the unexplained AD heritability, but are largely unknown due to limitations in traditional genome-wide association studies. Although rare variants 1and epistatic effects on AD are poorly understood, recent studies suggest that gene-gene interactions play a critical role in AD etiology and progression [3, [5] [6] [7] .\nA previous study [3] reported evidence of two genegene interactions that increase AD risk. Specifically, Ebbert et al. reported interactions between rs11136000 C/C (CLU; minor allele 5 T, MAF 5 0.38) and rs670139 G/G (MS4A4E; minor allele 5 T, MAF 5 0.38) genotypes (synergy factor [SF] 5 3.81; P 5 .016) and the rs3865444 C/C (CD33; minor allele 5 A, MAF 5 0.21) and rs670139 G/G (MS4A4E) genotypes (SF 5 5.31; P 5 .003). All three variants have been implicated in numerous AD GWAS studies [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] and are on the \"AlzGene Top Results\" list [14] , which summarizes the most established genes associated with AD.\nMS4A4E and CLU were recently replicated in a large meta-analysis of 74,046 individuals, but CD33 did not replicate [15] . Despite CD33 failing to replicate, several studies demonstrated that CD33 is involved in AD-related pathways and pathology, giving convincing evidence that CD33 is somehow involved in AD. Three specific studies demonstrated that CD33 alters monocyte function, amyloid uptake, and that CD33 expression is associated with clinical dementia ratings [16] [17] [18] . rs3865444 is located in the 5 0 untranslated regions (UTR) of CD33.\nThe association between CLU and AD status has been strongly established by both genetic and biological data. Recent studies demonstrated that rs11136000-an intronic single nucleotide polymorphism within CLU-is associated with AD-related pathology in healthy individuals including neural inefficiency [19] and decreased white matter integrity [20] .\nMS4A4E is a member of the membrane-spanning 4-domains subfamily A, but little else is known about the gene. However, rs670139-located in the MS4A4E 3 0 UTR according to gene model XM_011545416.1-is consistently associated with AD [15, 18, 21] .\nIn this study, we attempted to replicate these gene-gene interactions using the largest data set used in an epistasis study, to date [22] . We performed an independent metaanalysis of data sets from the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) using 3837 cases and 4145 controls, followed by a combined meta-analysis that included the original Cache County results [3] with an additional 326 cases and 2093 controls. We also tested for dosage or dominant effects and an apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 effect. Finally, we explored possible causal variants using wholegenome sequence data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data description", "text": "We used SNP data from the ADGC, which consists of 32 studies collected over two phases and includes 16,000 cases and 17,000 controls. All subjects are self-reported as being of European-American ancestry. More information about this data set can be found in the study by Naj et al. [8] and the ADGC data preparation description [23] .\nGenotype data from 2419 individuals from the Cache County Study on Memory Health and Aging were also used in this study. The full cohort of 5092 individuals represented approximately 90% of the Cache County population aged 65 years when the study began in 1994 [24] . The Cache County data consist exclusively of individuals of European-American ancestry. Exactly 2673 individuals were excluded from the original Cache County analysis because of incomplete genotype or clinical data [3] . Additional information on this data set can be found in previous reports [3, 24] .\nWhole-genome data from 747 individuals (223 controls, 195 cases, and 329 mild cognitive impairment [MCI]) were used in this article and were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu). ADNI is a large collaboration from several academic and private institutions, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the United States and Canada. Currently, over 1500 adults (ages 55-90) participate, consisting of cognitively normal older individuals, people with early or late MCI, and people with early stage AD.

For each ADGC data set, we filtered SNPs imputed with low information (info ,0.5) and converted the IMPUTE2/SNPTEST format files to PLINK format, using PLINK v1.90b2i [25, 26] . We used the default PLINK uncertainty cutoff of 0.1, meaning any imputed call with uncertainty greater than 0.1 was treated as missing. We included SNPs with a missing genotype rate less than 0.05 and individuals with a missing rate less than 0.01. We then extracted the SNPs of interest: rs3865444 (CD33), rs670139 (MS4A4E), and rs11136000 (CLU) and tested Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium [27, 28] . Using R version 3.1.1 [29] , we excluded samples without complete data for all covariates including age, gender, case-control status, APOE \u03b54 dose, and the two SNPs being tested in the corresponding interaction. Entire data sets missing in the respective SNPs or covariates after data cleaning were excluded from further analysis. The requirement of complete data for both SNPs and all covariates is necessary for this analysis. Unfortunately, this requirement led to the exclusion of 23 and 24 entire data sets for the CD33-MS4A4E and CLU-MS4A4E interactions, respectively. We also excluded the ADC1 data set because it contained only one AD case, likely making it biased.\nAfter data preparation, we tested the individual interactions in each data set using logistic regression. We defined the R models as \"case_control w rs3865444 1 rs670139 1 rs3865444:rs670139 1 apoe4dose 1 age 1 sex\" and \"case_control w rs11136000 1 rs670139 1 rs11136000:rs670139 1 apoe4dose 1 age 1 sex\" for the CD33-MS4A4E and CLU-MS4A4E interactions, respectively.\nCase-control status, SNPs, and sex were coded as factors, age was numeric, and apoe4 dose was an ordered factor from 0 to 2.\nUsing results from each study, we performed a metaanalysis to test replication across the ADGC data sets using METAL (version 2011-03-25) [30] and performed a second meta-analysis including the original Cache County results to provide SF and odds ratio (OR) estimates from the largest number of samples possible. We tested the originally reported interactions and heterozygous interactions (rs11136000 C/C-rs670139 G/T and rs3865444 C/Crs670139 G/T) to test for potential dosage or dominant effects based on suggestive evidence found in the original Cache County study (Supplementary Table 1 ). We assessed whether there is a dosage or dominant effect based both on whether the heterozygous interaction is significant and a t test comparing two means. Specifically, we tested for a significant difference between the homozygous and heterozygous effect sizes. A significant difference would suggest a dosage effect, whereas an insignificant difference would suggest the effect might be dominant.\nAfter the meta-analyses, we performed a permutation analysis with 10,000 permutations for interactions that replicated independently. For each ADGC data set, we randomly permuted case-control status across all individuals, tested the interaction, and reran the meta-analysis. We stored the P values from each of the 10,000 meta-analyses and calculated the empirical P value by finding the original P value's rank in the distribution of P values divided by the number of permutations. We also calculated the combined population attributable fraction (cPAF) as previously described [3, 8] .\nResults are represented using both ORs and SFs [6, 31] and their associated 95% confidence intervals and P values. SFs represent the ratio between the \"observed and expected ORs\" for the two interacting SNPs (Equation 1). The \"expected OR\" for the interaction assumes there is no synergy between the SNPs (i.e., the SNPs are independent) and equals the product of the individual ORs (the denominator of Equation 1) [6, 31] . Essentially, the SF measures how strongly the \"observed and expected OR\" relationship deviates from linearity, as the SF deviates from 1. A SF 5 1 suggests no synergy; rather, there is no evidence of statistical epistasis.\nBecause SFs ,1 can be challenging to interpret, we present interaction SFs in the direction .1. Consequently, we performed all interaction analyses using each gene's homozygous minor allele as the reference group, which is opposite the direction standardly used in genome-wide association studies. This also has the added advantage that the interaction's OR is presented in the risk direction for easy comparison with top AD risk loci. To calculate the interaction's OR, we used each SNPs individual OR as previously reported in a larger data set [21] , but we had to invert the individual ORs to be the same direction as our analyses. We then calculated the interaction's \"observed OR\" (Equation 1) using the inverted ORs. We also estimated each SF's 95% confidence interval using rmeta [32] .\nBased on results from the interaction replication, we performed a SF analysis using the Cortina-Borja [31] SF calculator to test for an APOE \u03b54 effect for the CLU-MS4A4E interaction. Specifically, we stratified the combined ADGC and Cache County data by APOE \u03b54 status and tested for an association between the interaction and case-control status within each stratum. Alleles rs11136000 C and rs670139 G were used as the exposed groups."}, {"section_title": "Exploring causal variants", "text": "As a follow-up analysis, we explored causal variants for replicated interactions using 747 (223 controls, 195 cases, and 329 MCI) ADNI whole genomes that were sequenced, aligned to hg19, and variants identified by Illumina using their internal analysis procedure. We used linkage disequilibrium, RegulomeDB (accessed November 2014) [33] , and functional annotations from wANNOVAR [34] to isolate SNPs of interest. We first extracted all SNPs within approximately 50 kb of each SNP of interest, calculated linkage disequilibrium using Haploview [35] , and retained all SNPs with a D' 0.99. Using RegulomeDB and wANNO-VAR, we annotated each remaining SNP for: (1) known regulation and functional effects; (2) minor allele frequencies from the 1000 Genomes Project [36] , 6500 Exomes Project [37] , and the ADNI data set; and (3) corresponding MutationTaster predictions [38] . We retained all nonsynonymous SNPs, SNPs located in UTRs, and SNPs with a RegulomeDB score ,4. For each retained SNP, we tested individual associations with case-control status in the 223 controls and 195 cases using the VarStats tool in the VariantToolChest [39] and subsequently tested their interaction with all SNPs in the other interacting gene using logistic regressions in R.\nWe explored causal variants in the CLU and MS4A4E regions using the ADNI whole-genome data. There were 36 and 32 SNPs that fit the inclusion criteria previously described for SNPs near rs11136000 and rs670139, respectively ( Supplementary Tables 3 and 4) . Most of the SNPs are rare (MAF ,0.01) according to the 1000 genomes, 6500 exomes, and ADNI data sets. None of the SNPs were significantly associated with case-control status individually or in the pairwise interactions. We identified two SNPs in MS4A4E (rs2081547 and rs11230180) that have a RegulomeDB score of \"1f \" and have been shown to modify MS4A4A expression [40] , the gene upstream from MS4A4E.

Although the heterozygous interaction did not replicate independently in ADGC, the combined metaanalysis including Cache County is significant (SF 5 1.90, P 5 .01, Fig. 1A ; Supplementary Table 1 ).

The CD33-MS4A4E interaction failed to replicate and may have resulted from overfitting in the Cache County data as previously described by Ebbert et al. [3] Overfitting happens when a model identifies random data patterns as significant when they are not truly relevant to the question at hand. Although there is substantial evidence that CD33 function is related to AD pathways and pathology [16] [17] [18] , our data do not support an interaction with MS4A4E that impacts AD risk.\nWe replicated the CLU-MS4A4E interaction, demonstrated an association in APOE \u03b54 negative subjects, and reported evidence of a possible dominant effect for MS4A4E. The homozygous interaction between rs11136000 (CLU) and rs670139 (MS4A4E) replicates independently in the ADGC data sets, supporting its validity. To provide SF and OR estimates from the largest number of samples possible, we report the combined meta-analysis SF and OR including the Cache County data. Given the broad sampling and large Fig. 2 . Forest plot showing APOE \u03b54 negative association with Alzheimer's disease case-control status. We tested for an APOE \u03b54 association with the CLU-MS4A4E interaction using the Cortina-Borja Synergy Factor Calculator [31] . Specifically, we stratified the combined ADGC and Cache County data by APOE \u03b54 status and tested for an association between the interaction and case-control status within each stratum. Alleles rs11136000 C and rs670139 G were used as the exposed groups. We found an association in the APOE \u03b54 negative stratum (synergy factor 5 2.08, P 5 .004, panel [A] ) that did not exist in the APOE \u03b54 positive stratum (synergy factor 5 1.19, P 5.26, panel [B] ), suggesting an APOE \u03b54 effect exists for this interaction. Abbreviation: ADGC, Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium. sample size used for this analysis, our results are likely to be generalizable to other populations of European ancestry. Further investigating this interaction in other ethnic groups is warranted.\nComparing the CLU-MS4A4E OR of 2.45 to top AD risk alleles according to AlzGene.org [14] along with APP, PLD3, and TREM2 adds greater perspective. Momentarily ignoring APOE \u03b54, APP, PLD3, and TREM2, the highest individual OR is from APOE \u03b52 (OR 5 1.61) [3, 14] when inverting to its respective risk allele, followed by ABCA7 (OR 5 1.23) [3, 14] , both of which are dramatically lower than 2.45. Of known AD risk loci, only APOE \u03b54 (OR 5 3.68), APP (OR 5 5.29), and TREM2 (OR 5 5.05) have ORs greater than 2.45 [3, 14, 41, 42] . The CLU-MS4A4E OR is even greater than the PLD3 Val232Met mutation (OR 5 2.10) [43] . These results suggest the CLU-MS4A4E interaction may play an important role in AD etiology.\nA distinction must be made regarding statistical and biological epistasis, however [22] . Although there is evidence that CLU, like CD33, interacts indirectly with MS4A2 [3] , little is known about MS4A4E itself and we do not know whether it biologically interacts with CLU. MS4A2 indirectly modifies BCL2L1 activation or expression [3] , which physically interacts with CLU. Research suggests CLU prevents amyloid fibrils and other protein aggregation events [44] , whereas MS4A4E may facilitate aggregation as a membrane-spanning protein.\nMembrane-spanning proteins play diverse roles in cell activity including transport and signaling. Experiments will be required to determine whether there is a biological epistasis between CLU and MS4A4E, and whether the interaction affects amyloid fibril formation. Our results indicate further investigative efforts in gene-gene interactions (and protein-protein interactions) may be important to resolve AD etiology.\nComparing means for the effect estimates to assess whether there is a dosage or dominant effect between the CLU-MS4A4E heterozygous and homozygous interactions was not significant, suggesting there may be a dominant effect for the rs670139 G allele. A dominant effect has important epidemiologic and heritability implications. Because the CLU-MS4A4E interaction increases risk, heterozygous individuals may be at equal risk compared with homozygous individuals.\nWe found an association between the CLU-MS4A4E interaction and case-control status in APOE \u03b54 negative subjects in the combined ADGC and Cache County data that did not exist with APOE \u03b54 positive subjects. This potential three-way interaction may provide valuable insight into AD risk and protective factors. A recent article by Jun et al. [45] found CLU has a stronger association in APOE \u03b54 positive individuals, whereas the region surrounding MS4A4E has a stronger association in APOE \u03b54 negative individuals. Further statistical and biological studies will be necessary to clarify these potential associations. Because all analyses in this study used each gene's homozygous minor allele as the reference group, the interaction between CLU-MS4A4E major alleles is framed as a risk factor, meaning the interaction between the minor alleles is protective. Because the tested heterozygous interaction also increases risk, the protective association may only apply to the interaction between the homozygous minor alleles.\nWe report several rare potential causal variants linked to rs11136000 or rs670139 with a D' 0.99 in the ADNI whole-genome data. No individual variants were significantly associated with AD risk in the ADNI data, but the analysis was likely underpowered with only 240 controls and 202 cases. Two particularly interesting variants, rs11230180 and rs2081547, are known to affect MS4A4A expression. We believe further analysis of these variants is necessary to better understand their involvement in AD. Exploring the effects of rs670139, itself, may also be important. Little is known about MS4A4E, including the gene's chromosomal structure. According to gene model XM_011545416.1, rs670139 is in the MS4A4E 3 0 UTR, but other gene models differ. 3 0 UTR variants can affect transcription and translation.\nThe cPAF for CLU-MS4A4E is 8.0, suggesting there would be an approximate 8% decrease in AD incidence across the population if both major alleles were eliminated. In reality, this estimate is for the causal variants that rs670139 and rs11136000 may be tagging, but the overall effect is nontrivial. Identifying a targeted treatment in the associated pathways could have a significant impact.\nA major gap in AD literature to date is the lack of known causal variants. Several SNPs have repeatedly turned up in genome-wide association studies, but the tagSNPs themselves are unlikely to play a direct role in AD etiology. What is more likely is that the tagSNPs are in close linkage disequilibrium with one or more causal variants. We hypothesize two possible explanations as follows: (1) the SNPs are linked to multiple rare variants that drive AD development and progression or (2) there is another common variant in the region with functional effects that remain unknown. In either case, given the biological complexity of AD and results presented in this study, we believe epistasis plays a critical role in AD etiology. As such, the community must continue to identify and vet these and other interactions that are supported in the literature. Equation 1 . The synergy factor describes the relationship between the expected odds ratio (denominator) and the observed odds ratio (numerator) for interacting variants. The expected odds ratio (denominator) assumes that both variants are independent (i.e., there is no synergistic, or nonlinear effect on the phenotype), whereas the observed odds ratio (numerator) "}]
