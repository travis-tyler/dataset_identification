[{"section_title": "Engineering Technology Education in the United States: Findings and Recommendations from an NAE Study", "text": "Policymakers, employers, researchers, and educators have focused considerable attention during the past decade on the adequacy of the US engineering education system to meet the demands of an increasingly \"flat\" world in which competencies that go beyond pure technical skills, including creativity, leadership, flexibility, and communication, are becoming more and more essential (NAE, 2004 and 2005) . Traditional engineering education is being challenged to respond to emerging fields that blur disciplinary boundaries, among them nanotechnology, synthetic biology, and biomimetics. And, although enrollments in US engineering colleges reached an all-time high in 2012, with minor declines since then (NSF, 2016a) , some still are concerned that the production of engineering graduates in this country lags behind that of some notable competitor nations, such as China, a shortfall not only in absolute numbers but also in the overall percentage of college graduates who have an engineering degree."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": "Largely absent from most discussions of the future of the United States' technical workforce, however, is the role that engineering technology (ET) education plays or should play in supporting the nation's technical infrastructure and capacity for innovation. This omission is worrisome because the number of people with this type of education, while smaller than for engineering, is nevertheless substantial. Relatively little is known, for example, about the extent to which the supply of those with 2-and 4-year ET degrees does-or does not-meet the needs of employers; what type of work those with such degrees perform; and the nature and significance of the differences between the knowledge, skills, and dispositions of those with ET degrees and those with engineering degrees.\nTo shed light on these and related issues, the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), with funding from the National Science Foundation, assembled a 14-member study committee. The committee, which met four times over a two-year period, was charged with examining the status, role, and needs of ET education in the United States. This paper is adapted from the committee's final report (NAE, 2017) ."}, {"section_title": "Data Gathering", "text": "Data gathering by the committee consisted of (1) collection and analysis of the relevant published literature; (2) review of relevant federal education and employment datasets; (3) a survey of engineering technology education programs and a survey of a sample of companies that hire graduates from these programs; and (4) a stakeholder workshop in late 2014.\nThe educational datasets used in the study were the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), the Baccalaureate and Beyond 2008/2009 (B&B) , and the Career/Technical Education (CTE) Statistics. Each of these datasets is produced and distributed by the Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics.\nThe labor market datasets used in the study were the American Community Survey (ACS), the Current Population Survey (CPS), the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) database, and the National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG). These data are made available by a variety of government agencies and present the STEM workforce generally and engineering technicians and technologists in particular in varying degrees of detail.\nThe survey of educational programs was conducted by the NAE. The survey of employers was conducted by the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) under contract to NAE.\nAt various points in the project, the committee encountered gaps in the available data, which limited its ability to address aspects of its charge. One key gap relates to the availability of data regarding the work experiences of students with 2-year ET degrees. This gap and several others are discussed at greater length in the committee's report."}, {"section_title": "The Origins of ET", "text": "Between 1945 and 1955, engineering technology was introduced as a new academic program at existing technical institutes located at institutions such as Purdue University and the University of Houston. During this period, the number of technical institutes increased from 44 to 69 (Smith & Lipsett, 1956 ) in order to house the growing number of new engineering technology programs. The technical institutes and ET programs followed a series of boom and bust enrollment cycles (Harris and Grede, 1977) . For example, from 1946-54 the engineering technology programs surged in enrollment with the influx of war veterans and passage of the GI Bill. But from 1954-57, enrollment stabilized or decreased due to the movement toward humanities and the arts by entering college students (Carr, 1979) .\nThe launch of the Soviet satellite Sputnik in 1957 played a key role in the next phase of development of ET education, the move to 4-year baccalaureate degree programs. Sputnik caused many to believe traditional engineering programs needed to be refocused in order for the United States to compete in the space race. This shift was achieved \"at the expense of design and application-based laboratory courses,\" according to Holloway (1991:94) . As a debate over the engineering curriculum grew, S.C. Hollister, president of ASEE, commissioned a review of engineering education, which would become known as the Grinter Report.\nA primary recommendation of the Grinter Report was for engineering programs to increase the mathematics, physics, and engineering sciences content of the curriculum (Grinter, 1955) . A draft of the report also recommended that engineering be bifurcated (Seely, 1995) . One form would focus more on the scientific and theoretical aspects of engineering and educate engineers working in research and design for the government. The other would focus on the more general, practical, and technical aspects of engineering and educate engineers for industry. However, the committee reviewing the report, led by Hollister, did not approve this recommendation, and it was removed from the final report.\nIn an ASEE oral-history project on engineering technology education, Winston Purvine, founder of the Oregon Institute of Technology, recounted a post-Sputnik talk by the dean of the College of Engineering at Michigan State in which the dean noted his institution \"has literally plowed under acres\" of laboratory space as the school reworked its engineering curriculum (O'Hair, 1995:263) . The curricular shift by engineering programs and the decision not to create two branches in the field created room for expansion of ET education into the arena of four-year baccalaureate degree programs. Noted Ungrodt:\nSome of the changes in engineering technology education have resulted from the changes in engineering education. The development of science oriented engineering curricula and the trend toward advanced level programs in engineering, as well as the rapid growth and development of associate degree programs in engineering technology, have stimulated the development of baccalaureate programs in engineering technology (1975:787) .\nDean Michael Mazzola of the Franklin Institute in Boston put it more bluntly: \"[T]he technical institute group, engineering technology, jumped into the gap. And this is why the four-year program was started, because engineering colleges were not doing engineering; they were putting too much emphasis on science\" (O'Hair, 1995:216) .\nThe other factor contributing to the birth of 4-year ET programs was the increasing number of junior and community colleges offering associate's degrees in \"engineering technology.\" At the 1958 mid-year meeting of ASEE's Technical Institute Division, Curriculum Development Chair H. H. Kerr voiced concern over the \"inroads\" that the vocational education system was making into technical education. Kerr noted that this set of institutions was much larger and more politically connected than the technical institutes and could pose a significant threat to engineering technology. It was during these discussions that the term \"technologist\" was coined to described graduates of 4-year ET programs (O'Hair, 1995:118) .\nHistorically, the technical institute programs had been confused with the vocational technical school programs, because of their similar two-year duration. The addition of engineering technology programs at the vocational schools and junior colleges only added to the confusion. Therefore, the \"expansion of the long standing engineering technology programs from two to four years is at least one way of maintaining the differential in level and standard which has existed between the technology programs and the vocational programs\" (Foecke, 1964:12) .\nABET-accredited bachelor's degree programs in ET soared from 2 in 1967 to 155 a decade later (ECPD, 1978 In 2014 there were 17,915 graduates of 4-year (bachelor's degree) ET programs and 34,638 graduates of 2-year (associate's degree) ET programs in the United States, according to the Department of Education's IPEDS. By comparison, in that same year 93,950 students graduated from 4-year engineering programs in the United States. Certificates in ET, which typically require fewer courses and take less time to obtain than does an associate's degree, have been awarded for decades. Since 2000, the growth rate of these certificates has surpassed that of both associate's and bachelor's degrees in ET ( Figure 1 ). And for the first time, in 2010, the absolute number of sub-associate's certificates exceeded the number of associate's degrees awarded in ET. In 2014, US institutions awarded 49,217 sub-associate's ET certificates. In terms of diversity, the share of students earning 4-year degrees in ET that is black is almost three times the share of students earning 4-year degrees in engineering (10.7 percent versus 3.8 percent). Blacks comprise more than 11 percent of those earning 2-year degrees and more than 17 percent of those earning certificates in ET; in engineering, the proportion earning 2-year degrees is slightly less than 6 percent (NSF, 2016a). The percentage of 2-year ET degrees awarded to blacks approaches their representation in the US population, 12.4 percent, and their share of certificates exceeds it. The proportion of 4-year degrees in engineering and ET earned by Hispanics is comparable, about 10 percent. By comparison, the share of Hispanics in the US population is a little over 17 percent. The share of Asians or Pacific Islanders that earns 4-year engineering degrees is almost three times the share that earns 4-year degrees in ET.\nWomen's share of 4-year engineering degrees was 65 percent higher than was their share of 4-year degrees in ET (19.8 percent versus 12 percent), though in both fields women remain significantly underrepresented. Women accounted for only 10 percent and 12 percent, respectively, of those earning ET certificates and 2-year ET degrees. Black women were the only subgroup of women who earned a larger share of 4-year ET degrees (2.1 percent of the total) than 4-year engineering degrees (1 percent of the total). Their share of 2-year ET degrees (1.7 percent) and ET certificates (1.5 percent) also surpassed their share of 4-year engineering degrees. According to IPEDS, there were 414 public, private, or for-profit academic institutions awarding at least one 4-year ET degree in 2014. Within this group, 38 awarded 100 or more degrees that year. A total of 1,192 institutions awarded at least one 2-year degree in the field in 2012. Fiftytwo of these institutions awarded 100 or more degrees.\nCompared with the tally of degree-granting institutions, determining the number of ET programs overseen by these institutions is more challenging. For one thing, as noted, there is no standard nomenclature for describing these programs. Also, IPEDS does not collect data on numbers of programs, only degrees. For program information, we must turn to other sources, such as the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). 3 According to ABET, in 2014 there were 387 accredited 4-year ET programs at 153 institutions and 257 accredited 2-year ET programs at 98 institutions. 4 The most common program at both the 2-and the 4-year degree levels was electrical and electronics engineering technology, followed by mechanical engineering technology ( Table 2 ). Three of the most-common ET program types at the 2-year level-in architectural, surveying and geomatics, and drafting and design engineering technology-are not among the top 10 at the 4-year level. These ABET data, of course, capture only programs accredited by that organization. By comparing the ABET list of programs with programs listed on the websites of IPEDS schools that award degrees in ET, the committee was able to estimate the number of programs that are not ABET accredited. At the 2-year level, there were 658 such programs; at the 4-year level, there were 141. An estimate of the complete universe of ET programs in the United States is presented in Table 3 . In an effort to get a sense of how many of these approximately 400,000 workers might be working as technicians rather than as technologists, the committee looked at survey respondents' degree attainment. Using this approach, the CPS and the ACS both agree that around 80 percent of these workers have 2-year degrees or lower educational attainment, while the remaining 20 percent have at least a 4-year degree. (The OES does not collect educational attainment information, so it is not possible to separate those who might be technicians from those who might be technologists in that dataset.) This parsing of the data needs to be interpreted with caution. For one thing, it assumes those with 2-year degrees cannot be working as higher-skilled technologists. For someone with many years of on-the-job experience, or with additional technical certificates beyond a 2-year degree earned at a community college, this may not be true.\nCollege graduates often do not work directly in their field of study and instead apply their knowledge or follow their interests to different occupations. Looking beyond early career graduates to the workforce as a whole, the NSCG reveals a small share (about 12 percent) of ET graduates report working as engineering technologists (Table 5) . This is larger than the share presented in the B&B (about 1.5 percent), but the number of graduates is still fewer than those who report they are working as engineers or in computer and IT occupations. The single largest occupational category for ET graduates is managers (23 percent of the total). This category includes engineering managers as well as other types of managers. The second largest category is engineer. Perhaps even more surprising than the low share of ET graduates who are working as engineering technologists is the high share of engineering technologists who have degrees outside of ET. This is true not only for recent graduates, as captured by the B&B, but also for the broader (and larger) population of degree holders captured by the ACS and NSCG (Table 6 ). In all three datasets, the plurality of technologists have a degree in engineering. The ACS and NSCG suggest that 30 to 40 percent of those working as engineering technologists do not have a 4-year degree in any science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) field. These data suggest that the population of those who are working as engineering technologists may include a large number of individuals who start in a related field, like information technology, and then enter the ET workforce by acquiring the required skills on the job. Alternatively, given the growing importance of sub-baccalaureate qualifications, graduates in entirely unrelated fields with weak job prospects may have transitioned to the ET workforce by acquiring certificates in that field. This is speculative, however, as none of these federal datasets provide a way to track individuals' accumulation of nondegree training or certificates.\nIn terms of earnings, federal employment surveys peg the average engineering technician and technologist annual earnings at between $48,000 and $57,000 (2015 dollars) in 2013, with the CPS providing a figure somewhat lower and the OES a figure somewhat higher than that central tendency. The real annual income of engineering technicians and technologists has remained remarkably stable over the last 40 years, with a consistent average of approximately $50,000 (2015 dollars), according to 1971-2015 data from the March CPS. This contrasts with the steady growth in real annual earnings for engineers, which grew from an average of just over $70,000 in the early 1980s to about $86,000 in 2015 (both 2015 dollars). Although weak real wage growth over the last several decades is a widely cited phenomenon, it is typically not considered to be as substantial a problem in skilled occupations.\nUnlike the relative stability of real annual income, data from the CPS indicate that the average age of engineering technicians and engineering technologists has shifted dramatically over the last 40 years. Less dramatic, but still significant, is the factor of aging in the engineering workforce. In the period between 1974 and 1983, the average age of technicians and technologists was 35.4 years. By the period between 2004 and 2015, the average age was 43.5 years. The increase in average age also is apparent for engineers. The distributions of ages also tend to have a higher concentration of older technicians and technologists and engineers for later employment periods. The data also show that the overall engineering technician and technologist workforce has aged over the last 40 years faster than could be mediated by taking on younger workers. In addition to the aging of this workforce, the workforce itself has been reduced. The number of workers over the age of 50, for example, is roughly comparable from 1994-2003 and again from 2004-2013, despite the fact that workers over the age of 50 make up a much greater share of the total engineering technician and technologist workforce in the latter period. The engineering workforce also has exhibited persistent aging over this period, although the trends are not as stark as in the engineering technician and technologist workforce.\nThe increasing average age of engineering technicians and technologists raises questions about the need for increased production of these workers to replace aging workers. Caution is required, though, in making direct inferences from an aging workforce to replacement demand in the future. Freeman (2007) demonstrates that, historically, aging occupational groups typically are not associated with a strong eventual resurgence in demand for younger workers. The reason for this is relatively straightforward: Workforces that are declining in size and importance in the economy demand and attract fewer workers, so that the average age increases until the labor market achieves a new steady-state equilibrium. Workforces where employers expect future growth typically recruit younger workers before the day of reckoning comes, and they exhibit declining average ages until they achieve their own, higher, steady-state equilibrium."}, {"section_title": "Work Roles", "text": "The work of engineering technologists has been described by drawing comparisons to engineering. One model, developed by the American Society of Mechanical Engineering (Figure  2 ), sees the jobs of engineering technologist and engineer as falling along a continuum. It is characterized at one end (engineering technology) by work involving distribution and sales; operation, service, and maintenance; and production engineering and at the other (engineering), by work emphasizing theory, analysis, and complex design. In this model, a number of workrelated activities can be performed by both engineers and technologists.\nFIGURE 2: An Engineering Technology -Engineering Education Continuum Model SOURCE: ASME, 2012. Used with permission.\nThe committee's two surveys probed perceptions about the differences in work performed by engineers and engineering technologists. More than half of employer respondents either did not know what the differences were or felt there was too much variability in performance to discern differences (Table 7) . Small and roughly similar percentages of respondents felt that ET graduates perform better than engineers do when given applied work. Eight percent of respondents indicated no difference in the work performed by the two types of employees. Land's 2012 survey of companies known to hire ET graduates also examined employer views of these differences. While some of the roughly 200 employers participating in that survey indicated they did assign job roles based on the degree held, the majority (67 percent) said there was no difference in roles and responsibilities assigned based on degree. A similar percent of respondents indicated they saw no significant differences in the capabilities of engineering and ET degree holders when performing similar roles. Land (2012) notes that the survey sample consisted of companies with existing relationships with 4-year ET programs, a fact that \"may well have influenced the results\" (p. 63). Engineering technology graduates perform better when doing applied work, while engineering graduates perform better in the use of higher-level science and mathematics.\n14.4\nEngineering technology graduates perform better when doing applied work, while engineering graduates perform better in doing engineering design."}, {"section_title": "18.0", "text": "Engineering technology and engineering graduates are essentially the same in terms of work performance."}, {"section_title": "8.1", "text": "There is too much variability in the work performance of engineering technology and engineering graduates to answer this question."}, {"section_title": "25.2", "text": "Don't know."}, {"section_title": "34.2", "text": "In the committee's survey, ET educators felt much more strongly than did employers that their graduates are better equipped than engineers are to do applied work. A full 80 percent indicated this to be the case, with a significant majority of these respondents indicating that the comparative strength of engineering graduates is in preparation to do higher-level mathematics and science. Almost 20 percent of these educators felt that the two sets of graduates have similar skills or that there is too much variability among the educational programs to answer such a question.\nAs noted earlier, employment data collected by the federal government do not distinguish the job duties performed by technicians from those performed by technologists. In order to understand more about the potential differences in work performed by the two groups, the committee included questions about work roles in its survey of employers. The survey asked employers to review a list of job duties and indicate which were done most frequently by those with a 4-year degree in ET (Table 8) and which were performed mainly by those with a 2-year degree ( Table  9 ). The results suggest that bachelor's degree holders have quite wide-ranging responsibilities, including those related to design, while the work of those with an associate's degree is more restricted. Employers indicated that the work of engineering technicians centers on testing and maintaining equipment; troubleshooting and repairing; and conducting quality control checks. Employer opinions about work roles, skills, and job performance need to be seen in light of the somewhat surprising finding that nearly one-third of those who initially responded to our survey indicated they had never heard of a postsecondary academic program called engineering technology.\n(Those who responded in this way did not complete the rest of the survey.) This same gap in knowledge held true even for firms in manufacturing, and for some sectors within manufacturing, such as pharmaceuticals, the number who had heard of ET was much lower. One of the employer groups least likely to have heard of the discipline was \"small employers,\" that is, those with fewer than 100 employees. Only 52 percent of this group were aware of the field. The background and experience of those filling out the committee's survey could have impacted these results. The survey instrument did not collect job-title information from respondents, but many of NACE's employer members are involved in college recruiting.\nThe hiring practices of the federal government also reflect perceived differences in work roles between engineering technologists and engineers. The federal Office of Personnel Management (OPM) places ET under the same broad category, \"All Professional Engineering Positions,\" that includes those with 4-year engineering degrees (OPM, 2012) . Technically, this means that some with 4-year ET degrees from institutions accredited by ABET can be hired by the federal government, but the OPM rules restrict hiring to entry-level jobs (GS-5, pay range $27k-$36k; those with \"superior academic performance\" may enter at GS-7).\nSome within the ET field believe that this OPM provision reflects a bias against the field and poses an unfair barrier to federal employment for engineering technologists. The National Engineering Technology Forum, an initiative of the Engineering Technology Council of the American Society for Engineering Education, has been lobbying for the creation of a separate federal job category, or the equivalent, for engineering technologists. In 2014 OPM drafted and circulated to other agencies for comment a proposal that would have reclassified engineering technologists. Subsequently, the agency decided not to move forward with the proposal.\nSeparately, the Department of Labor classifies engineering technologists and technicians among the occupations that are subject to minimum-wage and overtime-pay rules under the Fair Labor Standards Act (USDOL, 2008) . In contrast, engineers are exempt from these rules, because they are considered part of a \"learned profession.\" By DOL definition, a learned profession involves \"work requiring advanced knowledge,\" which is \"customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction.\""}, {"section_title": "Shortages", "text": "Economists are often skeptical of claims about labor market shortages; to a large extent, this is because of how they conceive of the problem of a shortage. A shortage is defined as a situation in which the number of workers who supply their labor at a given market wage is less than the number of workers demanded by employers at that wage. In this situation, economists would expect dissatisfied employers to bid up wages in an attempt to attract scarce workers. These higher wages would draw more workers into the market, lead some employers to reduce their quantity demanded, and thereby push the labor market back into equilibrium. In other words, market actors do not face any incentives to maintain shortages, so shortages should be fleeting problems.\nOne type of shortage, called a dynamic labor shortage, 6 may be more plausible in the market for engineering technicians and technologists than in other STEM fields. Many of these workers, particularly at the technician level, are educated at community colleges and therefore may be more tied to their communities than other workers are. Indeed, students often attend community colleges because they are geographically immobile, at least relative to those who attend 4-yeardegree-granting schools. Younger 2-year-degree or -certificate earners may be resource constrained, while older students may have families and other obligations that tie them to their community and make community college the best option. This introduces labor market rigidities that could prevent rapid readjustment to new demands. Community colleges also often develop their curriculum in response to and sometimes in partnership with local businesses. A large increase in demand for engineering technicians and technologists may occur in a region without a preexisting program at a community college, and the development of such programs to supply businesses with these workers may take time.\nTo test this general scenario, the committee used the 2000 and 2010 OES to assess the possibility of state-level labor shortages. First, we calculated earnings differentials between detailed engineer and engineering technician occupational categories as a percent of the engineering technician annual income level in each state. Six detailed categories were considered for each state: aerospace, civil, electrical and electronic, environmental, industrial, and mechanical engineers and engineering technicians and technologists. Since we expect engineers to earn more than technicians and technologists do, a small earnings differential for a given subfield in a state is indicative of high engineering technician and technologist earnings relative to engineers.\nThe state and occupational subfield of the lowest 10 percent of all earnings differentials (and therefore the highest relative technician and technologist earnings) are presented in Table 10 . Industrial engineering technicians and technologists are much more likely to have high relative earnings than are those in any other subfield, while the environmental and civil subfields maintain broader gaps between the earnings of technicians and technologists and engineers. Potentially of greater interest is the repeated presence of Montana (three cases) and Arizona, Alaska, and Massachusetts (two cases each) in the list of cases with relatively high engineering technician and technologist earnings. Montana, Alaska, and perhaps even Arizona may struggle with labor mobility and attracting technicians and technologists, driving up earnings before the market adjusts. This seems less plausible in the case of Massachusetts, although other explanations (such as labor market regulation or rapid growth in science-and engineering-related sectors of the economy) may be more relevant. Any state with an earnings differential that is substantially lower than the average is a candidate for a local labor market shortage, should there be a sudden increase in demand. Further analysis is required to determine what is actually driving the wage differential (Katz and Murphy, 1992). The committee examined other information relevant to the possibility of shortages, including the relationship between these earnings differentials and changes in employment; federal estimates of expected future job growth; and answers to questions related to the possibility of current and future shortages of ET graduates and workers in its surveys of employers and educators. The committee concluded that the available data do not show any clear indication of a shortage or a surplus of engineering technicians or technologists. This does not preclude the possibility of market imbalances in certain geographic areas, as noted above, or temporary imbalances that resolve themselves."}, {"section_title": "Select Findings and Recommendations", "text": "As an overarching concern, the committee believes that the national discussion about engineering needs to broaden to encompass the spectrum of degree types and skills discussed in this paper and its full report (NAE, 2017) . Our ability to attract and retain talented men and women across this continuum is necessary to maintaining the nation's health, safety, and economic security. Several findings and related recommendations follow. (Additional findings and recommendations are contained in the committee's report.) FINDING: Data collected in this project and by others show that, as a practical matter, engineering technology remains relatively hidden and misunderstood compared with the betterknown domain of engineering.\nFINDING: Engineering technology education is an important and underappreciated component of the US education system. The field's historical focus on application has advantages-for certain students and for some types of work-compared with traditional, more theory-and design-focused engineering education."}, {"section_title": "RECOMMENDATION:", "text": "Within academia, it is critical for leaders of 2-year and 4-year ET programs to engage more meaningfully in discussion with leaders in postsecondary engineering education about the similarities and differences between the two variants of engineering and how they might complement one another while serving the interests of a diverse student population. This engagement can be accomplished in dialog within and between individual institutions; through work by discipline-based and affinity engineering professional societies; and by leaders within the American Society for Engineering Education, such as the Engineering Technology Council, the Engineering Deans Council, and the Corporate Member Council.\nFINDING: Compared with engineering, engineering technology education programs, particularly at the 2-year level, are more attractive to older students and students currently underrepresented in STEM fields and of less appeal to women overall. FINDING: The connection between an engineering technology education and the ET workforce is fairly weak. Those with ET degrees work in a broad range of occupations, and those employed as engineering technologists have a diverse degree background.\nFINDING: Though average salary data hide potential low-and high-salaried outliers, the overall gap in earnings between technicians and technologists is quite small compared with the differential between engineering technologists and engineers. The relatively small salary premium for technologists, as compared with technicians, may be reducing incentives for entry into 4-year ET programs as well as tamping down overall interest in technologist jobs. Conversely, the relatively high salary potential of technician-level jobs may serve to increase interest in these jobs and educational pathways to them.\nThe ET education community should consider ways to make the field's value proposition more evident to K-12 teachers, students, and students' parents, as well as to employers. Such an effort might include new messaging developed in collaboration with a qualified public relations firm and based on data from market research on student and employer knowledge and perceptions of ET. The research might test the appeal and believability of rebranding ET as \"applied engineering\" or other appropriate names identified by the market research. Attention also should be paid to ways to reduce confusion associated with the term \"engineering technology\" and to simplifying degree nomenclature. To encourage collaboration and avoid duplication, plans for any major new outreach should be communicated with appropriate leadership within the engineering education community, such as the Engineering Deans Council and Engineering Technology Council of the American Society for Engineering Education.\nResearch is needed to understand why certain segments of the population graduate at higher frequencies from ET programs than they do from engineering programs and why women are even less engaged in ET than they are in engineering. Understanding the reasons for these preferences and trends may allow programs in both domains of engineering to better attract and retain more diverse student populations. The National Science Foundation should consider funding research on factors affecting matriculation, retention, and graduation in ET. The research might consider, among other factors, socioeconomic issues, such as the need for some students to work while attending school; issues related to the adequacy of secondary school preparation in mathematics and science; the presence and nature of mentoring, peer support, and other mechanisms known to increase enrollment and retention of women and underrepresented groups in STEM fields; and the nature of curricular differences between 2-and 4-year ET programs and between 4-year ET and 4-year engineering programs.\nResearch is needed to better understand the reasons for the apparent loose coupling of degree attainment and employment in engineering technology. Such research might consider how factors like the salary differential between ET and engineering jobs and lack of ET wage growth may be influencing students' academic and career choices. These and related questions might be addressed in studies supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) or by revisions in relevant survey instruments administered by NSF, the National Center for Education Statistics, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics."}, {"section_title": "Final Word", "text": "This paper identifies and analyzes information from a variety of sources that sheds light on the education and employment of engineering technicians and technologists in the United States. This important segment of the nation's STEM workforce has strong historical connections to traditional engineering and shares the same general sensibility toward technical problem solving. At the same time, the pedigree of ET is rooted in application-focused and hands-on learning, perhaps to a greater extent than in engineering.\nThe committee's review of the data uncovered a number of issues related to lack of awareness of the field, definitional confusion, pay differentials with engineering, engagement of populations typically underrepresented in STEM education, and the issue of shortages. The full report (NAE, 2017) also discusses the preparedness of ET students to cope with technological change and educational pathways to and from in ET.\nWe hope this paper and the full report spur greater understanding and further exploration of engineering technology education and of workers with ET-related skills."}]
