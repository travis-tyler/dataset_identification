Methodological Issues. The 2015 Indicators Report used Current Population Survey (CPS) data to estimate trends in bachelor's degree attainment. CPS is the only national source of yearly estimates for bachelor's degree attainment (the focus of Indicator 5), but it covers only dependent family members. It therefore has limitations for examining trends in bachelor's degree attainment by income-based quartiles due to differences in dependency patterns across income-based quartiles and changes in these patterns over time. For this 2016 edition, we have adjusted the CPS data to reflect more current estimates from the high school longitudinal studies.

In addition to providing longitudinal indicators of the status of equity, this report is written to advance productive conversation about the most effective policies and practices for improving equity in higher education opportunity and outcomes. To this end, the report includes three essays that connect the indicators to some current policy debates. These include discussions about how to reduce the stratification of college choice, higher education as a human right, and recommendations for the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act (HEA). We hope that, together, the indicators and essays promote productive dialogue about how to create meaningful progress in improving higher education equity. In early 2015, First Lady Michelle Obama called education the \"single most important\" civil rights issue facing the country. 1 Others have similarly identified education as the \"civil rights issue of our times\" and some have asserted that \"free higher education is a human right.\" 2 With these assertions, scholars, advocates, and politicians are echoing what the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of the United Nations (the Covenant) also declares: \"Higher Education shall be made equally accessible to all, on the basis of capacity, by every appropriate means, and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education.\" This covenant was adopted by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in 1966 and subsequently over the last 50 years was ratified as a binding covenant by 166 nations (excluding the U.S.). 3 Is higher education a basic human right, as articulated by the United Nations Covenant, or a moral imperative in a civilized society, with associated rights and responsibilities? Or, is higher education a personal or social investment or commodity? These fundamentally different views are important, as views about the role of higher education can influence decisions about funding, resource allocation, and governance. Our understanding of the role of higher education also affects the degree to which \"inequalities\" are tolerated, fostered, or addressed through public policy.

Yet, thus far, the courts have not ruled on inequities in access to higher education based on family income, parents' education, or social class. Greater attention to inequities in higher education opportunities and outcomes is warranted, given the increasing importance of higher education to the economic and social well-being of individuals and our society. If postsecondary education is necessary to obtain work that pays a living wage, then all individuals, regardless of family income, parents' education, socioeconomic status, or other demographic characteristic, should have equal opportunity to participate and benefit. Whether we believe that higher education is a civil right, an essential element of a full democratic society, or a fundamental requirement to enabling all to achieve the American dream, 5 the 2016 Indicators Report shows that higher education opportunity and outcomes are highly inequitable across family income groups. Moreover, on many indicators, gaps are larger now than in the past. The disinvestment of state funds for public colleges and universities since the 1980s and the declining value of federal student grant aid have aided in the creation of a higher education system that is deeply unequal. Once known for wide accessibility to and excellence within its higher education system, the U.S. now has an educational system that sorts students in ways that have profound implications for later life chances.

In contrast, considering enrollment, in fall 2013, public institutions accounted for 76 percent of enrollments; private non-profit institutions accounted for 16 percent; and private for-profit institutions accounted for 8 percent. As displayed in Figure 4, since 1975, public 4-year and 2-year institutions have consistently enrolled at least three-fourths of undergraduates.

The data are from two sources: 1) the cross-sectional annual data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey (CPS) series, which provides household-based national estimates and includes data on enrollment in any type of postsecondary institution; and 2) longitudinal studies of high school students that have been conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) at approximately 10-year intervals over the last 40 years. Data included in this section are from: the Education Longitudinal Study (ELS:2002) of students who were sophomores in 2002; the National Education Longitudinal Study of eighth graders in 1988 (NELS:88); and the High School and Beyond (HS&B:1980) study of 1980 high school sophomores. 12 We report data from the follow-ups 8 or 10 years after expected high school graduation (2012, 2000, and 1992, respectively). Definitions of the Indicators and information about classifications are noted below. \u2022 Cohort College Continuation Rate (CCCR) is defined as: the percent of the recent high school leavers continuing on to any type of postsecondary education, as measured by the Current Population Survey (CPS) and published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). \u2022 High School Graduates College Continuation Rate (HSGCCR) is defined as: the percent of high school graduates continuing on to any type of postsecondary education, as measured by the CPS and published by the BLS. 12 NCES also sponsored a study of the High School Class of 1972. Because this study started with the senior class and had follow-up limitations, we do not include data from this study for Indicator 1 figures. \u2022 Enrolled in postsecondary education within 8 or 10 years of expected high school graduation is defined as: the percent of students who, in nationally representative school-based longitudinal studies, self-reported having ever enrolled in any type of postsecondary educational institution, regardless of degree-granting status of the institution or the student's degree or certificate attainment status. \u2022 Income quartiles are specific to the population covered in a given data source. Using income quartiles facilitates comparisons of changes over time, as quartiles reflect a point in the distribution based on data for a given year. In 2014 the family income quartiles for dependent 18-to 24-year-olds identified by the distribution of family income data in the Current Population Survey were: \u2022 Bottom quartile: Less than $34,933 \u2022 Second quartile: $34,933 to $65,496 \u2022 Third quartile: $65,496 to $116,466 \u2022 Top quartile: $116,466 and above. In 2014, the maximum income for the lowest quartile was less than one-third (29 percent) that of the minimum income level of the top quartile. Reflecting growing inequality of income in the United States, the difference between the top and bottom family income quartiles has increased since 1970. 13 \u2022 Race/Ethnicity: We use the race and ethnicity categories reported at the time by each data source. The ELS race variables reflect new federal standards that require collecting race separately from ethnicity and allow respondents to mark more than one choice for race. \u2022 Socioeconomic Status (SES): This report uses the parental/family socioeconomic status (SES) composite included in the NCES longitudinal studies. The SES composite is based on data from the parent questionnaires or imputed from the student questionnaires and, for the four NCES longitudinal studies, are based on five equally weighted, standardized components: father's/guardian's education, mother's/guardian's education, family income, father's/guardian's occupational prestige score, and mother's/guardian's occupational prestige score. 14"}, {"section_title": "equity indicator 1a: How Do Cohort College Continuation rates Vary by Family income?", "text": "Indicator 1a shows the Cohort College Continuation Rate for recent school leavers (including those who did and did not complete high school) by family income quartile from 1970 to 2014.

ELS and HS&B sampled students when they were sophomores in high school. NELS:88 sampled eighth graders. Some differences in results can be expected due to the longer time period for dropping out of high school for students sampled in eighth rather than tenth grade. 16 Due to a high percentage of missing data for parent income, we use SES quartiles. SES is a composite measure that NCES derived in a comparable manner for the three studies. NCES imputed SES for all sample members, including those with missing data for the parent income variable. We use the SES measure rather than income alone for this indicator, as SES is considered more reliable than a single measure of family income; the latter tends to have a high rate of missing data and is subject to reporting error. The gap in the youth in the highest and lowest quartiles of parents' SES quartile who reported no postsecondary enrollment within 8 or 10 years of scheduled high school graduation was 40 percentage points among 1980 high school sophomores and 44 percentage points among 1988 eighth graders, but declined to 24 percentage points among 2002 high school sophomores.

Using IPEDS data, Indicator 2e presents the percent of full-time, first-time (FTFT) undergraduate students who received Federal Grants (Pell or other Federal Grants) from academic year 1999-2000 to 2012-2013 and shows that as institutional selectivity increases, the percent receiving Federal Grants decreases. In 2013, 15 percent of undergraduates attending the \"most competitive\" institutions were Federal Grant recipients. In comparison, over half of students at the following types of institutions received Federal Grants: 51 percent of undergraduates attending less competitive institutions, 55 percent at unranked 4-year institutions, 61 percent at 2-year or lessthan-2-year institutions, and 74 percent at private for-profit institutions. Although the percentage of students receiving Pell or other Federal Grants increased in all institutional categories between 2008 and 2011 (in the wake of the Great Recession), differences in representation of Federal Grant recipients by institutional selectivity have increased over time. Between 2000 and 2013, the share of undergraduates receiving Federal Grants increased by just 2 percentage points at the most competitive institutions (increasing from 13 percent to 15 percent) but by more than 10 percentage points at unranked 4-year institutions (from 44 percent to 55 percent), 2-year and less-than-2-year institutions (from 42 percent to 61 percent), and for-profit institutions (from 60 percent to 74 percent).

The average costs reported in this report are weighted by enrollment and are for undergraduates attending full-time. \u2022 The Maximum Pell Grant is the largest Pell Grant award that is allowed by federal law. The average Pell Grant award is substantially lower than the maximum. \u2022 Cost of Attendance (COA) is used in determining financial aid and is the total amount it will cost on average to attend college each year. The COA includes tuition and fees; on-campus room and board (or a housing and food allowance for off-campus students); and allowances for books, supplies, transportation, loan fees, and, if applicable, dependent care.

Early hopes expressed by Congressional committee supporters were that the Pell Grant would be funded at a level to cover close to three-fourths of the average yearly costs at public colleges. 36 This goal was never reached, but it came much closer to being attained in the early years of the Pell Grant Program than in recent years. The maximum Pell Grant for 2015-16 is $5,775. 37 Institutional averages of the Cost of Attendance (COA) as published by the College Board for 2015-16 are: \u2022 $16,833 at public 2-year institutions for commuter students within district; \u2022 $24,061 at public 4-year institutions for in-state students living on campus; \u2022 $38,544 at public institutions for out-of-state students living on campus; and \u2022 $47,831 at private non-profit 4-year institutions for students living on campus. 38 35 The figures are for the maximum Pell Grant. Average Pell Grants are lower than the maximum. In 1974-1975, the average award (in constant 2012 dollars) was $2,823 among the 567,000 Pell recipients, but the maximum (in 2012 dollars) was $4,690. In 2012-13 the average Pell Grant was $3,579 among the 8.9 million awards when the maximum was $5,550.

See Indicator 3a for the average for the total. Costs include tuition and fees, room and board. The maximum Pell Grant is the highest amount allowed by law. The average Pell award is substantially lower than the maximum.  In constant 2012 dollars, the maximum Pell Grant in 2012-13 would be $13,557 rather than $5,550 if it covered the same percent of college cost as in 1976.  Using data from the most recently available NPSAS (2011-12), Indicator 3c(i) displays the Average Cost of Attendance (COA) for dependent students by family income category. 39 Average Cost of Attendance (COA) increases with family income, ranging from $23,840 for students with family incomes of less than $10,000 per year to $35,319 for students from families with incomes greater than $200,000. Indicator 3c(i) shows that students from lower family incomes, on average, choose institutions with lower prices (as measured by total Cost of Attendance). Indicator 3c(ii) shows the extreme differences in the ratio of family income (as measured by the mid-point of each family income category) to average college costs. The COA was 238 percent of family income for dependent students with family incomes of less than $10,000, and 74 percent of those with family incomes of $30,000 to $40,000, but 18 percent of family income for students with family incomes of $200,000. For families in the median income category for U.S. families ($60,000 to $70,000), the average Cost of Attendance for one year was 42 percent of yearly income. 39 NPSAS categorizes students based on dependency status as defined for federal financial aid purposes. equity indicator 3c (ii): Family income as percent of average Cost of attendance (Coa) at institutions attended by dependent students: npsas:2012 indicator status: Unequal Family Burden relative to income In 2012 the Cost of Attendance (COA) was 238 percent of family income for dependent students with family incomes less than $10,000, but 18 percent of family income for students with family incomes of $200,000."}, {"section_title": "NOTE:", "text": "The Cost of Attendance (COA) includes the estimated average cost based on tuition, fees, room and board, and transportation for a full-time, full-year, dependent student attending a single institution.

Indicator 3d displays trends in \"unmet need\" by family income quartile. Unmet need is defined as financial need after Expected Family Contribution (EFC) and all grants and other discounts that do not have to be paid back are exhausted. Unmet need used here does not include loans. Although lower-income students tend to attend community colleges and other institutions with lower average Cost of Attendance, full-time dependent undergraduates in the lowest family income quartile averaged unmet need of $8,221 in 2012, and students in the second lowest family income quartile averaged $6,514 in unmet need. By comparison, students in the highest-income quartile averaged a surplus of $13,950 after expected family contribution and grants were deducted from average Cost of Attendance. Students in the third quartile averaged $1,047 in unmet need in 2012. 40 In constant 2012 dollars, average unmet financial need was more than twice as high in 2012 than in 1990 for full-time dependent undergraduates in the lowest family income quartile ($3,495 in 1990 vs. $8,221 in 2012). 40 A related trend is the increase in the percent of students for whom the Expected family contribution (EFC) is zero. In NPSAS:2012, 23 percent of dependent students had an expected family contribution of zero, up from 10 percent in 2000. Over the same period the percent of families with an expected family contribution greater than cost was 17 percent in 2012, down from 28 percent in 2000 (NCES, NPSAS:2000 and NPSAS:2012).  1990,1993,1996,2000,2004,2008,2012. information about the average Net Price of each postsecondary institution that participates in Title IV federal student aid programs. The HEA defines institutional Net Price as \"the average yearly price actually charged to first-time, full-time undergraduate students receiving student aid at an institution of higher education after deducting such aid.\" Essentially, Net Price moves beyond an institution's \"sticker price\" and provides students and families with an idea of how much a first-time, full-time undergraduate student who was awarded aid pays to attend a particular institution after grant or scholarship aid but not loan aid is subtracted from the published Cost of Attendance. \u2022 \u2022 Dependent Student status has a particular definition for financial aid eligibility and is defined as a student who is an undergraduate, unmarried, not a veteran, and younger than 24 years of age. For dependent students, the parents' income and assets are used to determine the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) even if the parents have no intention of helping to pay the student's college expenses. In exceptional cases (e.g., parental child abuse, parental communication with the child prohibited by a court), the institution's financial aid office may change a student's status from Dependent to Independent. \u2022 Unmet Financial Need is the difference between the costs of college attendance, the expected family contribution, and financial aid resources that do not have to be repaid (i.e., grants). \u2022 Debt Burden is the average cumulative debt for those graduating with a bachelor's degree in a given year. The data are from the NPSAS surveys administered between 1990 and 2012.\nThe numbers represent the 100 percent distribution of bachelor's degrees in a given year (e.g., in 2014, 54 percent were from the top quartile, 23 percent from the third quartile, 13 percent for second quartile, and 10 percent from the lowest quartile). SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Survey, October Education Supplement. Data from 1970 to 1986 consider unmarried 18-to 24-year-olds, and data from 1987 to 2013 are based on dependent 18-to 24-year-olds, Equity Indicator 5b uses data from the three most recently released NCES high school longitudinal studies to report bachelor's degree attainment rates for students 8 or 10 years after their expected high school graduation. 49 In this comparison we use family socioeconomic status (SES), a composite indicator based on parental income, education, and occupation, rather than a single measure of self-reported income. 50 Indicator 5b shows that the share of youth attaining a bachelor's degree within 8 or 10 years of their expected high school graduation varies substantially by parent socioeconomic status (SES). For the ELS high school class of 2004, 15 percent of high school sophomores from the lowest SES quartile attained a bachelor's degree within 8 years, compared with 22 percent of youth from the second SES quartile, 37 percent from the third quartile, and 60 percent from the highest SES quartile. As noted in the discussions of previous indicators in this report, comparisons of bachelor's degree attainment across the three studies are limited somewhat by differences in the surveys. HS&B surveyed 1980 sophomores and followed the cohort 10 years after expected high school graduation (1992). NELS surveyed 1988 eighth graders and followed students 8 years after their 1992 expected high school graduation date in 2000. ELS surveyed 2002 high school sophomores and followed them to 8 years after their 2004 expected high school graduation (2012). The NELS:88 data is expected to report a higher percentage of students who did not complete high school than the HS&B and ELS sophomore studies, as the latter two studies started two years later in school (when some early dropouts may have already left high school and thus would not be in the sample eighth grade, while ELS sampled tenth graders (after some students may have already dropped out of school). Given that Census Bureau data show that high school non-completion rates are higher for those in the bottom income quartile than for those with higher incomes (see Appendix A), this caution may be more applicable to the bottom than the top quartile. Over the period the top SES quartile has shown less change in high school dropout rates and less gain in high school completion rates than the bottom quartile. Bachelor's degree attainment rates also increased across the three cohorts for youth in the second and third SES quartiles. For instance, the attainment rates for youth in the second SES quartile increased from 15 percent for 1980 tenth graders, to 19 percent for 1988 eighth graders, to 22 percent for 2002 tenth graders. For youth in the highest SES quartile, the percent attaining at least a bachelor's degree within 8 or 10 years of scheduled high school graduation was similar for 2002 tenth graders (60 percent) and 1988 eighth graders (62 percent) but higher than for 1980 tenth graders (52 percent).  Whether first enrolling in a 2-year or 4-year higher education institution, most students report aspiring to obtain a bachelor's degree. 52 Indicator 5c(i) describes the percent of dependent students who first enrolled in any type of postsecondary education institution who earned a bachelor's degree within 5 or 6 years of initial enrollment. Data for this Indicator come from three waves of NCES's longitudinal Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS) studies. These three waves track students who first enrolled in academic years 1989 -90, 1995-96 and 2003-04 through the follow-up studies conducted in 1994, 2001, and 2009, respectively. The share of dependent students who earned a bachelor's degree within 5 or 6 years of initial enrollment increases with family income quartile. Among dependent students who first enrolled in the 2003-04 academic year, the rate of obtaining a bachelor's degree rose from 26 percent for those in the bottom income quartile, to 36 percent for those in the second quartile, to 46 percent for those in the third quartile, to 59 percent for those in the top quartile. The percent of dependent students from the bottom income quartile who obtained at least a bachelor's degree within 5 or 6 years of initial enrollment remained unchanged at 26 percent for all three cohorts. For those in the top income quartile, the percent of obtaining a bachelor's degree increased from 51 percent for those who entered in 1989-90 to 58 percent for those who entered in 1995-96, but remained unchanged for those who entered in 2003-04 (59 percent). The bachelor's degree attainment rate also showed little change for those in the second quartile (34 percent for those who enrolled in 1989-90, 32 percent for those who enrolled in 1995-96, and 36 percent for those who enrolled in 2003-04). For dependent students in the third income quartile, the percentages obtaining a bachelor's degree were 40 percent for BPS:1994, 41 percent for BPS:2001, and 46 percent for BPS:2009. Reflecting the stability in the percent of beginning students who obtain a bachelor's degree in each quartile, the gap for those in the highest and lowest family income quartiles remained virtually unchanged for the two most recent BPS cohorts (at 33 percentage points). 52 For example, data from the ELS: 2002 show that 80 percent of high school students hoped to obtain a bachelor's degree or higher, including 60 percent of those in the lowest socioeconomic quartile. Similarly, data from the Condition of College and Career Readiness 2014 ACT Survey data indicate that 80 percent of first-generation college students expect to obtain a bachelor's degree or higher. NOTE: Income quartiles are based on applicable BPS sample family income at the start of the study. For example, dependent BPS:2004 family income levels by quartile were as follows: Bottom, less than $32,000; Second, $32,000-59,999; Third, $60,000-$91,999; Top, $92,000 or more. The BPS:2004 quartiles reflect 2002 family incomes for the first-time, college-going population entering in 2003-04, whereas the CPS reflects the income distribution of families of 18-to 24-year-olds for the entire nation for the year specified. Direct comparisons between the CPS and BPS are not possible due to differences in populations."}, {"section_title": "equity indicator 4a: what share of Higher education Costs are paid by students and their Families?", "text": "Equity Indicator 4a describes the \"funding responsibilities\" for the costs of attending U.S. public and private higher education institutions, as reported in the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) from 1952 to 2014. Since 1980, the percent of higher education costs covered by state and local governments has declined, resulting in a shifting of the responsibility for paying for college costs to students and parents. State and local sources accounted for a high of 58 percent of higher education expenditures in 1975, but just 37 percent in 2014. The percent of the total costs borne by parents and students reached a low of 33 percent in 1980 and rose to 51 percent in 2014. The share of higher education costs provided by the federal government was about the same in 2014 as in 1980 (12 percent) and has fluctuated in relationship to economic conditions. 41 The shift in payment sources from state and local governments to students and parents is reflected in the rise of tuition and other college costs over the same period and occurred in a period when average wages were static or declined in constant dollars. 41 The impact of the Great Recession in increasing the federal share through ARRA and further dampening State and local shares of the total can be observed. Between 2008 and 2011, the share paid by federal costs rose from 9.7 percent in 2008 to 15.9 in 2011 and declined to 11.8 percent by 2014.

Although the CPS data is the only available annual source of data, the data have important limitations and caution is needed in interpreting the results. The CPS includes only individuals who were considered \"primary dependent family members\" at the time of the CPS survey. For this reason, the 2016 Indicators Report also presents estimates of bachelor's degree completion from the NCES longitudinal studies that include all members of a cohort. 47 For the reasons noted above, we are including CPS data on the \"distribution\" of bachelor's degrees from 1970-2014 rather than the attainment rates by age 24. We include CPS based attainment rates in Appendix A (updated from the 2015 Indicators report using data from the high school longitudinal studies). Because of the strong positive relationships among family income, dependency status, and degree attainment, CPS data published in previous reports likely over-estimated bachelor's degree attainment for the top income quartile.

Perna and Roman Ruiz 57"}, {"section_title": "University of Pennsylvania", "text": "Among the distinguishing characteristics of the U.S. higher education system are its size and institutional diversity. 58 In 2014, the United States was home to nearly 4,700 degree-granting institutions and several thousand more non-degree-granting institutions (Figure 1). 59 The nation's postsecondary educational institutions vary in level (4-year, 2-year, less-than-2-year), control (public, private not-for-profit, and for-profit), selectivity of admissions, credentials awarded, curricular and extracurricular programs offered, number of students enrolled, location, mission, and many other dimensions. This impressive array of options ostensibly ensures that all students have the opportunity to enter the postsecondary educational institution that best suits their individual needs, goals, and priorities. Yet, despite the great number and diversity of postsecondary educational institutions in the U.S., the 2016 Indicators Report shows that, on average, students from lower-income families are enrolling in institutions with different characteristics than students from higher-income families. Students from low-income families (as measured by receipt of Pell Grants or other Federal Grants) represent considerably smaller shares of first-time, full-time degree-or certificate-seeking undergraduate students at private not-for-profit four-year institutions (33 percent) and public four-year institutions (38 percent) than at public two-year (56 percent), for-profit four-year (74 percent), and for-profit two-year (71 percent) institutions (Indicator 2c). Low-income students represent less than one-infive first-time, full-time degree-or certificate-seeking undergraduates attending the nation's most competitive (15 percent in fall 2012) and highly competitive (19 percent) institutions, about a third (30 percent) of students attending very competitive institutions, and 42 percent of students attending competitive institutions, but represent more than half of students attending less competitive (51 percent), non-ranked four-year institutions (55 percent), two-year or less-than-two year institutions (61 percent), and for-profit institutions (74 percent, Indicator 2e). Although characterized as differences in college \"choice,\" \"choice\" is a misnomer for describing the college destinations of many low-income students.  (Table 317.10). Retrieved from http://1.usa.gov/1TLlH4C. among the array of available options nationwide. But, resource constraints and structural failures often limit the \"choices\" of students from lower-income families to the local or online, non-selective or for-profit postsecondary educational institution. No college choice is possible if students choose not to enroll in postsecondary education. Among high school graduates, rates of continuing on to postsecondary education are substantially lower for those from the lowestincome quartile than for those from the top quartile (60 percent versus 87 percent in 2014, Indicator 1b). This 27 percentage-point difference in enrollment rates means that substantially fewer students from lower-than higherincome families are \"choosing\" a path that tends to yield considerable economic and non-economic benefits in the short-and long-term. Higher education is associated with countless benefits for individuals, including higher earnings, better working conditions, higher rates of employment, lower rates of unemployment and poverty, better health, and longer life expectancies. Our society also benefits, as with higher educational attainment comes greater economic productivity, less reliance on social welfare programs, greater civic engagement and charitable giving, and higher rates of voting. 60 Why does it matter that college \"choices\" are stratified based on family income? The benefits of higher education are greater for those who complete a college degree than for those who do not. But, completion rates are lower at the institutions in which low-income students are relatively concentrated: twoyear and for-profit institutions rather than four-year public and private not-for-profit institutions and institutions that are less rather than more selective. Among degree-seeking students who first enrolled in fall 2009, the share who had no credential and were no longer enrolled 6 years later was higher for those who first entered four-year for-profit institutions (56 percent), two-year public institutions (45 percent), two-year not-for-profit institutions (40 percent) and two-year for-profit institutions (35 percent) than for those who first entered four-year public (25 percent) and four-year private not-for-profit institutions (19 percent). 61 At public four-year institutions, six-year bachelor's degree completion rates for first-time, full-time students who first enrolled in 2007 range from a low of 33 percent at open-admissions institutions to a high of 85 percent at institutions that accept no more than 25 percent of applicants. 6-year completion rates at private non-profit four-year institutions also increase with selectivity, ranging from 38 percent at open-admissions institutions to 91 percent at institutions that accept fewer than 25 percent of applicants. 62 Where a student attends college is also associated with differences in other outcomes. Institutional selectivity, as measured by Barron's, is a strong positive predictor of enrolling in graduate school, as well as the Carnegie Classification of the graduate institution attended. 63 As measured by average SAT scores, the selectivity of the undergraduate institution attended is also positively related to annual earnings for Black and Hispanic 60 Baum, S., Ma, J., & Payea, K.

Borrowers who attend for-profit 2-year and 4-year institutions, as well as private not-for-profit 2-year institutions have significantly greater likelihood of loan default than borrowers who attend public four-year colleges. 65 How can we reduce the stratification of college choice? Although framed as differences in \"choice,\" differences in the distribution of students from low-and high-income families across different types of postsecondary educational institutions reflect differences in the structures in which low-and high-income students are embedded. 66 Students (perhaps with their families) decide to enroll in college, and select a particular college to attend, based on their assessment of the benefits relative to the costs. But, these cost-benefit calculations are not made in a vacuum; they are informed by the views, understandings, and resources of their families, as well as the characteristics and resources of the high schools they attend and the neighborhoods and states in which they live. To reduce the stratification of college choice, we need a comprehensive approach 67 that ensures that students from low-income families have the: 1. Financial resources required to pay college costs. The costs of attending college include not only tuition and fees, but also the costs of room and board, books, and other supplies, the costs required to participate in campus life, and the opportunity cost of foregone earnings. For many students, the sticker price is reduced by some amount of financial aid. But, over time, the purchasing power of the Pell Grant has declined (Indicator 3b(ii)) and the costs of paying for higher education have been shifted to students and their families (Indicator 4a). Research suggests that robust need-based financial aid programs can increase the economic diversity of elite institutions by encouraging more high-achieving, low-income applicants who otherwise would not apply. 68 2. Academic preparation required for college-level work. Both the availability of academicallyrigorous coursework and participation in academically-rigorous coursework vary across schools. About 23 percent of 2009 graduates of public and private high schools in which no more than 25 percent of students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch took calculus, compared with no more than 12 percent of graduates attending high schools with higher shares of low-income students. 69 Showing the same pattern, about half (49 percent) of 2009 graduates of public high schools in which no more than 25 percent of students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch earned credits in dual enrollment, Advanced Placement, or International Baccalaureate courses, compared with only about a third of graduates of public high schools with higher shares of lowincome students. 70 In recent years, upper-middle and upper-income families have been increasing their investments in their children's academic readiness, a pattern that will only further widen the gap in higher education opportunity and outcomes across demographic groups. 71 3. Knowledge of college choices, financial aid, and other aspects of the college-going process. Research shows the positive relationship between the availability of high school counselors and four-year college enrollment rates. 72 But, at most high schools, and especially at high schools serving large shares of low-income students, counselors are not available to provide the needed assistance. The number of students per counselor averaged 553 at public elementary schools and 421 at public high schools nationwide in 2010-11. 73 We must also do more to improve outcomes for students who enroll in college, especially those who enroll in less-selective four-year institutions, community colleges, and for-profit institutions. Students who enter these institutions must have effective: 1. Opportunities to become ready for college-level work. Although more students are taking the ACT and SAT, college-aspiring high school seniors are largely underprepared for college-level work as measured by the companies' college readiness standards. 74 Among recent high school graduates, only 42 percent met SAT's college-and career-readiness standards; only 28 percent of ACT test takers met college-readiness benchmarks on all four subject tests. Students who enter postsecondary institutions with weak academic skills often require developmental education. Among students who enter community colleges, approximately 60 percent enroll in at least one remedial course, and many more are assigned to remedial education but never enroll. 75 For students who are prescribed developmental education, the chance of successfully completing the assigned remediation sequence is low. In a national longitudinal study of 57 community colleges, only 46 percent of those assigned to reading remediation and 33 percent of those assigned to mathematics remediation completed their assigned sequence. Although research shows conflicting effects of remedial education on college outcomes, 77 institutions are exploring innovative practices to ensure student success for those assigned to developmental coursework. Mainstreaming students who place into remedial-level mathematics courses into creditbearing mathematics courses with supplemental academic supports may improve course completion rates and allow \"remedial\" students to earn college credit. 78 Learning communities may also improve student outcomes. Under this model, a cohort of low-academic performing students is co-enrolled in a developmental course and additional courses such as a major-specific course or first-year experience course. 79 More comprehensive learning community models may incorporate integrated curricula, tutoring, and enhanced academic advising. 2. Pathways that enable students to transfer from one postsecondary educational institution to another without loss of credit. On average, low-income students are less likely than higher-income students to transfer from 2-year to 4-year institutions, and those who do transfer are less likely to attain a bachelor's degree. 80 Many states have legislated state-or system-level articulation agreements between 2-year and 4-year sectors, but a number of states continue to permit institutions to define their own transfer policies. 81 Some, but not all, states guarantee transfer of general education credits taken at 2-year intuitions within the same state. Ensuring that meaningful college choice is not merely a privilege of the most advantaged students requires commitment and action from multiple players and stakeholders. The federal government plays a role via the student financial aid, student support programs, and other initiatives created by the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended over time and soon to be reauthorized again. State governments can promote college affordability (via policies pertaining to appropriations to institutions, financial aid to students, and tuition-setting policies), ensure that students can transition between K-12 and higher education institutions and between higher education institutions without loss of academic credit, and encourage the availability of high-quality postsecondary educational options. 85 Colleges and universities can promote outcomes for low-income students by controlling costs, awarding student financial aid based on financial need, and providing academic and other support services. K-12 schools play a role by ensuring the availability of and enrollment in academicallyrigorous courses and providing information about and assistance with college-going processes throughout the educational pipeline. The stratification of college choice illustrated in this 2016 Indicators Report is the product of a complex, cumulative and longitudinal process that begins at an early age-arguably at (or even) before birth. To reduce this stratification and create meaningful college choice for low-income students, we need commitment from multiple stakeholders and a comprehensive approach that addresses the many systemic and structural forces that limit opportunity and outcomes for low-income students.

This includes financial aid programs that assist most college students to pay their college attendance costs and support services programs such as the federal TRIO and GEAR UP programs supporting increased higher education opportunity. This law was passed in 1965 and was subsequently reauthorized in 1968, 1972, 1976, 1980, 1986, 1992, 1998, and 2008 with new initiatives, changes, and adjustments in each reauthorization.

The reauthorization process presents an opportunity and an obligation to address the issues brought to our attention in this Indicators report concerning the barriers that continue to be faced by a growing share of college students.

The economic engine that has driven growth in the United States since 1973 is now driving economic growth and development worldwide. Economic development now hinges on human capital productivity and development. \u2022 Since 2000 family incomes have declined. Median family incomes peaked in 2000 then declined slowly until the Great Recession in 2008 when they dropped sharply. Family income has not recovered from this drop. \u2022 Since 1980 states have been defunding public higher education. The current state investment efforts are, on average, 55 percent of what they were in 1980. This has led public colleges and universities to raise tuitions to replace lost state operating support.

Increasing the Pell Grant maximum award to $13,000 would address the most serious financial barriers faced by students from the bottom half of family income, up to about $65,000 per year. 87 The Pell Grant maximum award would be $13,986 at a public 4-year institution, $9,173 at a public 2-year institution, and $13,159 at a private 4-year institution in 2014 to equal 1980 purchasing power.

The family income, assets, age, size, number in college and other information are used in a federal formula to calculate an Expected Family Contribution (EFC). If this EFC is calculated to be less than zero, it is reset to zero by policy choice and the negative EFC is ignored in further federal, state and institutional need analysis. When this calculated EFC falls below zero, this means that the family lacks resources to maintain itself at the low living standard used to protect family income from assignment to the EFC to help pay the student's costs of college attendance. In reality this also means that the student was often contributing to family support through earnings from employment prior to college. This responsibility to provide for one's family does not disappear when the student goes on to college. In one current study (Wisconsin) 40 percent of Pell Grant recipients reportedly sent money home to their families during the school year when they were away at college. On an anecdotal basis, this behavior is common knowledge among financial aid administrators. Zeroing out a negative EFC is a policy choice that denies the reality of survival in families with very low incomes. It's a bad choice and should be repealed. The negative EFC calculated from FAFSA data should be retained and used to fund a Super Pell Grant that would be used by students at their discretion to send to their families or reduce their education loans.

Since about 1980 states have ratcheted downward their annual investment effort in higher education. By 2015 state appropriations for higher education as a share of state personal income averaged about 55 percent of what it had been 35 years earlier. If states had invested in public higher education in 2015 at the same rate they had in 1980 they would have appropriated $65.2 billion more than they did. As states have reduced their funding for public higher education, state colleges and universities have raised their tuition and fee charges to students to offset their lost state funding support. Very few states have made any effort to alleviate the consequences on educational opportunity of this cost-shift on students from low, lower-middle, and now upper-middle income families with state funded need-based grants of their own. So the price of higher education goes up while family incomes are going down. States have turned away from investing in higher education because the growth in federal student financial aid has allowed them to do so. This proposal seeks to re-engage the states in making their colleges and universities affordable for their own needy citizens. Beyond a certain basic federally funded Pell Grant, states should match the federal award on a dollar-for-dollar basis.

These jobs have been replaced with 88 http://www.bls.gov/schedule/archives/all_nr.htm#HSGEC employment in service industries, which have grown from 59.7 percent of employment in 1945 to 86.3 percent by 2010. These industries include education and health care, professional and business services, financial activities, leisure and hospitality and other services. In these service industries the economy calls for more and higher levels of education and training. So higher education has transitioned from one of several portals to the middle class, increasingly, to the sole gatekeeper. The metrics of the class-selective institutions stand in opposition to the aims and purposes of Title IV student financial aid programs specifically, and the tax-exemption benefits accorded social institutions that provide important social benefits. Title IV student financial aid program eligibility should be reserved for those institutions seriously engaged in recruiting, admitting, supporting, educating and graduating students who are at a disadvantage in their pursuit of opportunity for higher education. And tax exempt status should be restricted to those educational institutions pursuing broadened social inclusion in their recruiting, admission, retention and graduation programs. For discussion purposes, we offer this proposal. Class-exclusive colleges would be defined as those with undergraduate enrollments of less than 25% Pell Grant recipients. To continue their eligibility for Title IV federal student financial aid programs these institutions would be required to admit a substantial portion of their entering freshmen on a lottery basis from a pool of open admission applicants. Continued eligibility for Title IV programs would be determined by their rates of success graduating these students compared to the graduation rates of the class-selective admissions process of the institution."}, {"section_title": "Setting Funding Targets for TRIO and GEAR UP of Serving at Least 20 Percent of Eligible Students", "text": "When Congress first authorized the TRIO programs under the HEA and established the first of the programs in 1965, they acknowledged that financial aid alone would not be enough to ensure college success for low-income, first generation, and students with disabilities, but that additional support services were also critical. Despite studies that have shown that participation in pre-college and college support services substantially increases low-income and first generation students' chances for success, funding levels have only ever been sufficient to serve a very small percentage of the eligible students in any given year. Estimates are that the less intensive pre-college programs (Talent Search and GEAR UP), reach about 4 to 9 percent of eligible students in any given year. The more intensive programs such as Upward Bound (UB) and Upward Bound Math Science (UBMS) reach about 2 percent of eligible lowincome, first generation students. The college support programs, Student Support Services (SSS) and McNair programs, combined, serve about 4 percent of the number of students who receive Pell Grants each year. Moreover, the numbers of students served and funding in constant dollars have actually declined over the last decade-even as the numbers of low-income and first generation students have increased. A recent increase, in 2015 (the first of the 21 st century) will not even restore the number of students served to the previous levels at the start of the decade. This pattern of level or funding cuts, with very low percent of eligible low-income and first generation students served has led to missed opportunities for substantial numbers of students to help increase their chances for college access and success. As Indicator 5c has shown the bachelor's degree attainment rates for beginning postsecondary students who are low-income and first generation are about half (21 percent compared to 57 percent) the rates of those who are neither-low-income or first generation. There is a considerable body of evidence from evaluation studies that these programs make a significant difference, and are often the deciding factor in college access and success for lowincome, first-generation students and students with disabilities. Using data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS), a nationally representative sample of U.S. high school students in the 1990s, Horn and Chen found in correlational analysis that participation in pre-college programs doubled the odds for enrollment in a 4-year college after controlling for other factors known to be related to college entrance. 89 Similarly, studies of both Talent Search and Upward Bound have shown effectiveness. 90 The random assignment evaluation of Upward Bound (UB) found that participation in UB, the most intensive of the Federal pre-college programs, resulted in a 50 percent higher bachelor's attainment rate in 6 years among low-income and first generation students who were randomly assigned in middle school or early high school to Upward Bound and who entered the program. Comparisons of Student Support Services retention and completion rates likewise shows that substantially more SSS students are retained and complete college compared to the national averages. For example, among 2-year institutions 86 percent of SSS students were retained to second year compared with 65 percent of students from a national sample and 94 percent of SSS students beginning at 4-year institutions were retained compared with 79 percent for the national sample. 91"}, {"section_title": "Rigorous Evaluation of All Financial Aid Programs", "text": "The management of public monies and programs requires oversight. That oversight involves regular assessment of program performance relative to the purposes for which policies, programs and funding were created and provided. This requirement applies to financial aid programs-all financial aid programs and not just those that serve financially needy students. In our experience the principle of program evaluation is applied only to government programs that serve poor people. These programs receive regular scrutiny by federal contractors such as MDRC and others that use random assignment and other credible methods to assess the effectiveness of programs. But programs that serve affluent populations never receive such objective assessment. This omission is important because higher education largely serves affluent populations, and the amount of money the federal government provides to higher education goes largely to wealthy institutions and wealthy families-not to poor families and poor institutions. This federal largesse is provided in the form of tax breaks: charitable contributions, deductions, income tax credits, etc. In the same spirit that federal programs that serve poor students are rigorously evaluated for effectiveness, federal programs that serve wealthy institutions and families should be rigorously evaluated for effectiveness. Anything less reveals a class-biased agenda in the guise of objective program evaluation."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The current reauthorization of the Higher Education Act and its financial aid programs provides a long overdue opportunity and imperative to address the extraordinary financial barriers faced by a majority of college students today. These barriers include unmet financial need, student work-loan burden, net price to family, net price tax on family income, and educational debt. These barriers have grown in depth and breadth to adversely affect student access, choice, persistence and completion. During 35 years of neglect, these financial barriers have been allowed to grow far beyond the resources of those children born into the lowest income families. These barriers are now adversely impacting a broad swath of middle income families, and even some from families that many people would consider almost affluent. Financial barriers exist because not everyone has the family resources to pay college attendance costs. Not until family incomes reach about $95,000 does the Expected Family Contribution exceed Costs of Attendance at an average cost public 4-year college or university. Below this income level, students need financial aid to pay the remaining costs of college. And median family income for families with dependent members aged 18 to 24 years is now about $65,000. The consequences of allowing these financial barriers to grow for decades are clearly apparent. The realities surrounding opportunity for higher education are clear, and compel a substantial revision to the financial aid programs authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. Congress schedules periodic reviews of the Higher Education Act to address the issues, problems and needs of targeted populations. Our proposals for this reauthorization address many of the most apparent and serious financial barriers students face in paying for college. Others, too, are making bold proposals for this reauthorization. Congress will be judged by how effectively it addresses these challenges. The lives of today's children will either benefit or be damaged by the Congressional response."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "As the Introduction to the 2016 Indicators Report notes, in this period of recovery from the Great Recession and the upcoming 2016 Presidential elections, the concept of higher education as a basic human right has re-entered the national conversation. 93 This essay presents a discussion of the differences in policy stemming from views as to whether higher education is a civil or human right with associated public and private rights and responsibilities, or, in contrast, is a competitive investment consumer commodity with other associated rights and responsibilities. In the first part of the essay, we present an historical review of the development of the education as a human right perspective in the international context of the post-World War II period. We then review the more recent decades which have seen the rise of the new \"knowledge-based human capital economy\" in which higher education is more predominantly seen as a commodity subject to consumer protection rights. The second part of the essay focuses the identification of certain recent strains in the commodity investment perspective that have led to the recent reemergence of human rights-based proposals calling for universal free higher education."}, {"section_title": "I. Historical Growth of Views that Higher Education is a Human Right in the United States and International Law in the Post World War II Period", "text": "While the \"equality\" of all citizens who possess \"certain inalienable rights\" forms the founding principle and purpose of the U.S. government as expressed in the Declaration of Independence, 94 education is not one of the rights specified in the U.S. Constitution or the Bill of Rights. Internationally, it was the growth of socialist thought in the 19 th century that held that it was the task of the state to ensure the economic and social well-being of the community, and therefore individuals had claims to basic welfare services against the state. Education was viewed as one of these entitlements. Socialist ideals were included in the 1936 Soviet Constitution, which was the first constitution to specifically recognize the\" right to education\" with 92 All views expressed in this essay are the sole responsibility of the authors, and do not represent the position of the Pell Institute for the Study of Opportunity in Higher Education or the Alliance for Higher Education and Democracy of the University of Pennsylvania (PennAHEAD)."}, {"section_title": "93", "text": "While not typically drawing the same policy conclusions, as Professor Diane Ravitch has noted, reformers and advocates from both the right and the left have identified issues around education as: \"the civil rights issue of our times\" http://dianeravitch.net/2015/06/01/thecivil-rights-issue-of-our-time-2/ Recently the conversation has come to include higher education with such questions being included in the presidential debates. For example, when asked about the topic in a Democratic primary debate, Presidential candidate B. Sanders stated, \"I think what we need to do is say is yes, higher education should be a right.\" 94 \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,\" IN CONGRESS, July 4, 1776. The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America. a corresponding obligation of the state to provide it. The constitution guaranteed free and compulsory education at all levels, a system of state scholarships and vocational training. Subsequently the right to education featured strongly in the constitutions of other socialist states. As Indicator 6 shows, today according to OECD statistics, the Russian Federation is among the leaders of the world in the education level of its citizens. 95 In the United States, the origins of free public and eventually compulsory elementary and high school schooling stem from the \"common school\" idea of the 19 th century, when the U.S. was primarily an agrarian immigrant nation. This concept was initiated as a practical policy promoting \"all-inclusive schooling\" to integrate children into the American way of life--and as a promising means of promoting economic selfsufficiency, work opportunities in an increasingly urbanizing society, and the ability to fully participate in a democracy. However, as the U.N. Rapporteur noted in her 2002 report on the status of education as a human right in the United States, these \"common schools\" were not \"all-inclusive\" but had major exclusions based on race, gender, and economic status. The President argued that the \"political rights\" guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights had \"proved inadequate to assure us \"equality\" in the \"pursuit of happiness.\" Roosevelt's remedy was to declare an \"economic bill of rights\" which would guarantee eight specific rights. Among these rights was the right to \"a Good Education.\" The eight interrelated rights were:   1965 (reauthorized in 1968, 1972, 1976, 1980, 1986, 1992, 1998, and 2008). Growing out of the civil rights movement and the \"War on Poverty,\" the Higher Education Act of 1965 and subsequent re-authorizations have defined the structure of the federal student aid system and of the role of the federal government in supporting the extension of higher education to those who were regarded as \"disadvantaged\" by measures of family income, parent education, disability status, English Language Learner status, migrant status, homelessness, and, for certain programs, minority status. With regard to the student financial aid system that developed over the period, family income was to be the sole determining factor. The HEA did not refer to higher education as a right, but the law did recognize that certain individuals who were underrepresented were at a \"disadvantage\" and did not have an equal opportunity for higher education. This legislation mandated that equal opportunity be fostered and that funding for what were called \"disadvantaged\" students be set in place at the federal levels. Higher education for those who had the interest and ability was regarded as a key part of the \"War on Poverty.\" The extended opportunities for a college education were anticipated to be a major key to ending poverty and promoting full participation in the \"Great Society\" of President Johnson. The law affirmed the positive role of higher education for the wellbeing of individuals to fully participate in a democratic society, and to benefit the country. In this way the HEA recognized, as Amartya Sen has stated, \"Poverty is not just a lack of money; it is not having the capability to 99 See http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/. realize one's full potential as a human being.\" 100 The HEA was also consistent with the social justice theory of thinkers such as John Rawls in its provision of benefits for those in the \"original position\" of unequal resources and opportunity in society. 101 It also allowed institutional choice for students, as federal aid was portable between institutions. The Federal Grants were to be awarded through higher education institutions based on individual students' free choice of the institutions they attended. As noted in the 2016 Indicators Report, the original intent of what came to be known as the \"Pell Grants\" was that the aid would be able to cover about 2/3 to 3/4 of the costs at public colleges and that low-income students could work a modest amount through programs such as \"Work Study\" to cover the remaining costs. schools and students, on finding alternatives to public schools rather than improving them. The goal of inclusiveness was displaced by selection and segregation. 105 Focus on Achievement for Global Competitiveness. In the 1990s, Congress passed the GOALS 2000: Educate America Act under President Bill Clinton. The act set eight specific goals to be reached by the year 2000, including global preeminence in math and science, and the legislation provided \"resources\" to states and communities to ensure that all students \"reach their full potential.\" 106 It was based on the premise of \"outcomes-based education\" that students will reach higher levels of achievement when more is expected of them. As the 21 st century began, the U.S. continued the focus on \"excellence,\" now spoken of in terms of reducing the \"academic achievement gaps\" between various groups of students. These gaps were While not a formal set of criteria, the fulfilment of the right to education has also been discussed by the UN Human Rights Council using what is known as the \"4 As\" framework, which asserts that for education A copy of this act is available on line at http://www2.ed.gov/legislation/GOALS2000/TheAct/index.html. No Child Left Behind mandated that schools and districts reduce the test score gaps among these eight groupings and attain proficiency levels by 2014. The current mission statement can be accessed at http://www2.ed.gov/about/overview/ mission/mission.html. to be a meaningful right it must be available, accessible, acceptable and adaptable. 109 In countries such as Britain, a binding party to the Covenants, the international legal rights to free higher education are emerging as a basis for challenging proposals by the government to raise tuition fees. As noted by Professor Gerladine van Bueren, an international law professor at the University of London, \"International law regards a university education as a universal human right\" and this could form the basis for a serious legal challenge to raising education fees. 110 The European Student Union's basic position is that \"the understanding of education as a public good and a public responsibility is a pre-requisite for equal access to education. Public responsibility in financing of HE and social services for students is a means of ensuring that access does not depend on the socioeconomic background of learners or their families.\" 111"}, {"section_title": "Growth of the Global Commodification of Higher Education", "text": "Concomitant with the growing perspective that education is a human right with associated rights and responsibilities, in recent decades, with the growth of the \"knowledge economy\" there has been the growth of the perspective that higher education is a consumer good in which individuals and societies invest for their futures. Commodification has been defined as the process by which \"social domains and institutions, whose concern is not producing commodities in the narrower economic sense of goods for sale, come nevertheless to be organized and conceptualized in terms of commodity production, distribution and consumption.\" 112 In the commodification of higher education, institutions and their faculty members become defined in terms of their productive capacity. In 2005, the European Student Union published a policy paper on the \"Commodification of Education\" in which the ESU both describes the process of commodification and re-affirms its contrasting view that education should continue to be addressed as a human right. It states: ESIB (ESU) believes that open access to all levels of education is the cornerstone of a socially, culturally and democratically inclusive society and a pre-requisite for individual development and well-being. However in the economic debate, which emphasizes the importance of the knowledge based economy, this definition of education is evermore contested and education has come to be understood solely as an economic factor rather than a tool for social development. In this context, Higher Education (HE) is perceived as a knowledge industry and Higher Education Institutions (HEIS) as service providers. Students are looked upon primarily as consumers of education and human capital for the labor market. Students tend to focus less on active participation in higher education institutions. Many are choosing to focus only on preparation for the labor market and possibilities for maximizing personal financial returns upon graduation... This has also led to a decrease in cooperation and solidarity between individual students and an increase in unhealthy competition for the purpose of the fulfilment of personal aims. It is thus the increasingly commercialized way in which higher education is being dealt with that is referred to as 'commodification' of education. 113 Growth in the U.S. of the Right to Know Accountability Regulations: HEA Consumer Information. Reflecting a commodification approach, the accountability provisions enacted by law and regulation since the 1990s have centered on \"consumer right to know\" information that is increasingly considered necessary for students to make informed choices about where to enroll in postsecondary education. These laws and regulations most resemble a consumer protection approach. 114 The consumers are both the individual students making so called \"informed choices\" and the federal government representing the public taxpayers' \"right to know.\" All institutions participating in Title IV programs must comply with the requirements. These requirements stem from the 1990 Student Right to Know Act, which covered postsecondary institutions' reporting obligations to the federal government and also specified information that must be made publicly available by all institutions to all prospective and enrolled students. Subsequently, the specific information required has been renewed and more requirements added. Currently, institutions are required to report consumer information on: the cost of attendance, net price of attendance, financial assistance available, requirements for grants and loans, academic programs, special facilities for students with disabilities, privacy safeguards, campus crime and drug use rates, accreditation information, completion and graduation rates, transfer rates, standards for satisfactory progress, and if applicable, follow an equity in athletics disclosure act requirement. 115 The new College Score Card, mandated by Congress and developed by the Department of Education and released by the Obama Administration in 2015, focuses on identifying colleges that are considered the \"best buys\" or investments based upon available \"outcome\" data. The Score Card has carried the provision of consumer choice information for college to a new level of technological efficiency, but the validity of the comparisons has been questioned. 116"}, {"section_title": "II.

The website, https://collegescorecard.ed.gov, offers the public a quick, easy way to learn about institutions' annual costs, graduation rates and median earnings after graduation. model to higher education. These strains have led to a re-introduction of consideration of higher education as a human right entitlement to which all citizens have equal access. More reflection is needed on what changes would be needed to realize a system where each citizen regardless of family income or academic merit was entitled to a higher education designed to fully develop their capacity to participate in gainful employment, civic responsibilities, and the \"pursuit of happiness\" for their own well-being and that of the common good. Among the \"strains in the system\" and areas of current concern are: \u2022 The student debt-crisis. As the 2016 Indicators Report shows, using NPSAS:12 data, about 70 percent of those graduating with a bachelor's degree had student loan debt and the average debt was about $30,000. Those receiving Pell Grants, despite choosing to attend lower cost colleges on average, had more debt than those not receiving Federal Grants. This debt totaled about 1.3 trillion in 2014. Given the state disinvestment in public higher education, this troubling trend is likely to continue. \u2022 Lack of control of availability of employment in specific areas of study; the vulnerability of different generations to the economic downturn cycles that may impact their whole lives. 117 \u2022 The high levels of unemployment and underemployment of youth who have attained bachelor's degrees while saddled with large debts. When higher education is viewed as an investment commodity and as a consumer choice for students and for society, the expectations are that it will consistently yield personal and societal benefits that justify the expenditures, both private and public. Within the U.S. context, college students are told that they will get good jobs upon completion and thus be able to pay off student loans. The experiences of the past decade with the Great Recession and unrelenting increases in college costs at the same time that incomes have been stagnating has led to a rethinking of the current financial aid models. \u2022 118 Davis, A. , Kimball, W. & Gould, E. (2015). The Class of 2015: Despite an improving economy, youth grads still face an uphill climb.\" Economic Policy Institute Briefing Paper # 401. Retrieved from http://www.epi.org/publication/the-class-of-2015/. are underemployed, more are working part time or in low wage jobs since 2000, while fewer are working in good non-college jobs. It is likely that close to half of the college degree completers will not find a job that requires college degree and more students will end up with low-paying jobs despite the high amount of student loan they had to repay.\" 119 \u2022 The concerns of the non-completers. As the 2016 Indicators Report shows, low-income and first-generation students are much less likely to attain a bachelor's degree than students who are more advantaged. These students have a higher probability of defaulting on their loans. The economic downturns hit lower income students the hardest. \u2022 Higher rates of growth by other countries in educational attainment over the recent decades. Countries that have taken different approaches than the U.S. have had markedly greater rates of increase in higher education attainment over the past few decades and have now surpassed the United States in college attainment levels of their citizens 120 \u2022 Lower social mobility in the United States than similarly developed countries. A recent OECD study comparing educational attainment among more than 25 highly developed countries found that the United States was characterized by both \"high inequality\" and \"low intergenerational mobility.\" 121 \u2022 Negative health impacts of over-competitiveness becoming apparent. Competition among students once thought to increase overall achievement has many negative health consequences for students from all social sectors and this has led to a reaction among middle class parents manifest in movements such as the Race to No Where. 122 The competitive creation of winners and losers at all levels of education, but especially with regard to college (entrance into college and in grading system once enrolled) creates unhealthful conditions for learning. \u2022 The overly complex \"College Choice\" and financial aid system. There is a recognition that there is a need for a much simpler financial aid system and not just a simplification of the FASFA form. 123 \u2022 Decline in levels of public support. This decline is reflected in the erosion of state funding and the erosion of percent of college costs that can be covered by Federal Grants from about covering 2/3 of the cost to about one-quarter of the costs. \u2022 Excessive work hours needed to meet costs increasingly recognized as a barrier to completion and student success. The rising cost of college, combined with the decline in grant aid coverage, has created increased levels of work hours which students cite as the major reason for leaving without completion. 124 119 Abel, J. R & Deitz, R., Su, y. (2014). Are recent college graduates finding good jobs? Current Issues in Economics and Finance. 20 (1). Federal Reserve Bank of New york. \u2022 The growth of performance-based measures in Pell such as the 2010 Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) regulations that result in students unable to make quick progress losing their Pell Grants. 125 \u2022 Questioning the legitimacy of the merit-based admission system. Increasing stratification of resources based on the system with market-driven costs has resulted in a tiered system overtly based on \"merit,\" which serves as a proxy for social class. 126 Universities were once held out as a fulfillment of America's promise of equal opportunity, serving as drivers of social mobility and democratic ideals. Some argue that instead, these institutions \"are functioning to select and privilege elite individuals rather than create learning communities geared to advance democratic societies.\" All of these factors have led to a resurgence of the perspective that higher education should be considered an equally accessible human right rather than a consumer investment commodity. It remains to be seen whether any of the proposals for universal free public higher education will be enacted. As Richard Eskow has noted in his essay arguing that the time has come for free universal college: But the American educational tradition has never been strictly utilitarian. Public institutions of higher learning shouldn't exist merely to provide free employee training for the private sector. Colleges and universities must also produce the musicians, writers, philosophers, scientists, and visionaries of tomorrow. We must stay true to the vision of educational philosophers like John Dewey, who recognized that the primary purpose of education at all levels is to produce fully-realized citizens in a democratic society. The ability to participate fully in all aspects of democratic life has always been the American dream. Free higher education is essential to realizing that dream, and it's an idea whose time has come. 127 125 Schudde, L. and Scott-Clayton, J. (2014 \u2022 Indicator 2e: The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) is the primary data source for this Indicator. This Indicator is constructed by merging the Institutional Characteristics (IC) and Student Financial Aid (SFA) IPEDS survey components (https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/resource/survey_ components.asp). This Indicator tracks the percent of undergraduate students who receive any Federal Grant by institution each academic year from 1999-2000 to 2012-2013, the most current year of SFA data.

Table A-5 shows that, despite the rise in high school graduation rates for those in the bottom income quartile especially over the past decade, high school graduation continue to vary by family income. Appendix Table A-5 is based on Current Population Survey (CPS) as published yearly by BLS. We include this data here because high school graduation is necessary for college degree attainment  1964 1968 1972 1976 1980 1984 1988 1992 1996 2000 2004 2008  \u2022 Equity Indicator 5a-5d. We report multiple measures for Indicator 5, given concerns about the limitations of relying on the annual CPS data for estimating degree attainment rates. Although the CPS data is the only available annual source of data, the data have important limitations and caution is needed in interpreting the results. The CPS data are cross-sectional and include only individuals who were considered \"primary dependent family members\" at the time of the CPS survey. Recent years have seen differential changes across income groupings in dependency patterns and length of time for bachelor's degree completion. For this reason, the 2016 Indicators Report also presents estimates of bachelor's degree attainment from the NCES high school and beginning postsecondary longitudinal studies that include all members of a cohort. We also use IPEDS completions data on the distribution of bachelor's degrees by race/ethnicity. For the reasons noted above, we use CPS data to report the \"distribution\" of bachelor's degrees by family income quartile from 1970 to 2014 in Indicator 5a rather than attainment rates by family income by age 24 (as in Indicator 5a in the 2015 report). Because of the strong positive relationships among family income, dependency status, and degree attainment, CPS data published in the 2015 Indicator Report likely overestimated bachelor's degree attainment for the top income quartile Table A-6 shows revised estimates of CPS-based attainment rates that attempt to account for these issues. In addition to using the HS&B (1980 high school sophomores), we adjusted data from CPS using estimates of bachelor's degree attainment rates by SES quartile from the more recently completed high school longitudinal studies NELS (1988 eighth graders) and ELS (2002 sophomores). Using data from these additional longitudinal surveys resulted in little change in the our 2015 CPS based estimates for the bottom, second, and third income quartiles but reduced the CPS based estimates of bachelor's degree attainment for the top quartile. Caution is needed in using these adjusted CPS estimates given the many underlying assumptions. pell Institute 2016"}]
