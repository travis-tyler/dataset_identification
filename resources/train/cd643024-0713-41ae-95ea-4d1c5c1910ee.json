[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The number of reports on the cognitive neuroscience of aging has increased in recent years, and most of these studies have found many similarities in the patterns of activity in young and old adults, indicating that basic neural mechanisms are maintained into older age. Despite these overall similarities, older adults often have less activity in some regions, such as medial temporal areas during memory processing and visual regions across a variety of cognitive domains. It seems clear that age reductions in cognitive function can be tied, at least in part, to these reductions in brain activity. On the other hand, older adults typically also overrecruit some brain areas, mainly the ventral or dorsal prefrontal cortex during memory tasks, as well as both the frontal and parietal regions during tasks engaging cognitive control processes, such as attention. Sometimes this overrecruitment appears to be in response to altered function in other brain regions and is often seen in those older adults who perform better on the task at hand. These findings have provided rather convincing support for the idea that overrecruitment can be compensatory in the elderly. Nevertheless, not all age increases can be interpreted as compensatory, and some are more indicative of neural inefficiency. The challenge facing future research will be to understand the task conditions that promote compensation in older adults, the role of the various brain areas in aiding cognitive function, and how these compensatory mechanisms can be elicited to enhance quality of life in the elderly."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "The past few years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of reports using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore brain function (Bandettini 2007) . Although still a small proportion of the total, the number of articles on the cognitive neuroscience of aging also has increased in recent years (Cabeza et al. 2005) . Work in this area has focused primarily on memory, which reflects the large behavioral literature on memory changes in older adults. Behavioral studies typically show reductions in memory function in older adults, particularly in terms of episodic memory (e.g., Balota et al. 2000) and working memory (e.g., Foos & Wright 1992; Hasher & Zacks 1988) . Consistent with these behavioral data, reduced brain activity in older adults, compared with that in younger adults, has been noted during a variety of memory tasks, in regions such as the left prefrontal cortex (PFC) during encoding, or learning new material (Cabeza et al. 1997; Grady et al. 1995; Logan et al. 2002) and medial temporal areas during memory encoding and retrieval Grady et al. 1995; Gutchess et al. 2005 ).\nHowever, reports of increased brain activity in older adults, compared with that in young adults, have attracted more interest from researchers in this field. This \"overrecruitment\" typically is found in the frontal lobes, either in areas of the PFC not active in young adults or in homologous regions in the opposite hemisphere from regions active in the young. These agerelated increases have been seen in episodic memory tasks (Cabeza 2002) , working memory tasks (Grady et al. 1998; Reuter-Lorenz et al. 2000) , and even in perceptual tasks (Grady et al. 1994) . Because this pattern of overrecruitment in older adults has been reported in those who perform better on the task Grady et al. 2005) , there have been suggestions that additional recruitment of brain activity compensates for age-related changes in brain structure and function. On the other hand, some of this increased prefrontal activity in the elderly may reflect greater need or use of frontally mediated executive functions at lower levels of task demand than would be necessary for activation of this area in young adults. In this case, the increased activity in the PFC might not be related to performance on the particular experimental task but would reflect a type of nonselective recruitment in older adults, perhaps related to task difficulty (Logan et al. 2002) . Thus, although additional recruitment of PFC in older FIGURE 1. Age differences in brain activity during auditory working memory are shown (adapted from Grady et al. 2008) .

This review will group the past year's work on the basis of four broad themes that characterize the research foci emerging in the past year. These are (1) studies focusing primarily on the effects of age on specific cognitive processes, (2) studies that address the relation of activation to underlying structure or vasculature, (3) the elucidation of cognitive networks by using analytic approaches that emphasize functional connectivity, and (4) studies whose main aim is the exploration of the relation between activation and behavior in older adults to find evidence for or against the compensation hypothesis."}, {"section_title": "Specific Cognitive Processes", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Memory", "text": "Recent work has continued to focus on memory mechanisms, as did many of the earlier studies in this field. Two experiments have used the mixed blockevent type of fMRI design (Donaldson et al. 2001) to look at both sustained and transient activity in young and older adults during memory processing. Dennis et al. (2007) examined brain activity during a semantic encoding task by using words, and measures of both trial-related transient activity and blockrelated sustained activity were obtained. In the analysis, both transient and sustained activity were weighted by whether each stimulus was remembered and the participant's confidence in the memory judgment. Transient activity during encoding showed a reduction with age in the hippocampus and visual regions but increased activity in the left dorsolateral PFC. In contrast, sustained activity in the right dorsolateral PFC was lower in older adults, and no areas showed sustained increases. The authors suggested that during semantic classification, older adults show less spontaneous engagement of hippocampally mediated encoding processes but greater use of semantic processes mediated by the left PFC. Also, the decline in sustained right PFC activity may involve age-related deficits in sustained attention that affect encoding processes. A somewhat different result was reported by Grady et al. (2008) , who used environmental sounds and a mixed block-event fMRI design to examine working memory for spatial and nonspatial auditory information by using one-back tasks. Sustained activity during blocks of the two types of task was assessed, along with transient activity to targets. In this experiment, older adults had more sustained activity in the left inferior PFC, as well as left parietal and bilateral occipital activity, during both tasks (FIG. 1A) . Age increases in transient activity were seen only during the nonspatial task in the parietal and subcortical regions. There were many differences between the design of these two experiments, so they cannot be compared directly, but the different results in the PFC indicate that additional recruitment of PFC-mediated executive functions in older adults can be either sustained throughout performance of a memory task or engaged transiently for processing of specific items. In both cases, this overrecruitment of the left PFC supported performance in the elderly, because it was found during successful encoding events or during performance of a working memory task on which no age difference in accuracy was seen.\nTwo other studies reported age differences in both PFC and hippocampal activity during memory processing. These studies also attempted to remove any confounders of performance differences in older adults by studying conditions under which older adults can perform as well as do younger adults. Daselaar et al. (2006) used a verbal recognition task to assess recollection and familiarity in young and older adults, and the group matched performance on a subjectby-subject basis in the two age groups. They found a dissociation within the medial temporal lobes between recollection-related activity in the hippocampus, which was reduced in older adults, and familiarity-related activity in the rhinal cortex, which was increased in older adults, relative to the younger group. Older adults also showed reduced functional connectivity within a hippocampal-parietotemporal network but increased connectivity within a rhinal-frontal network. The authors interpreted these findings as evidence that older adults compensate for hippocampal deficits by relying more on the rhinal cortex, possibly through a top-down frontal modulation. Fernandes et al. (2006) compared young and old adults on verbal recognition memory tasks under both full and divided attention, in which the secondary task was making animacy judgments on words. Older adults showed the same amount of memory interference as young adults during the divided-attention condition. Younger adults in the divided condition showed an increase in the left inferior PFC, coupled with a decrease in right hippocampal activity; these effects were diminished in older adults, who also showed an increase in anterior frontal activity bilaterally. Fernandes et al. concluded that the equivalent memory interference seen in the older adults was due to both a dampening of the hippocampal and left inferior PFC responses to divided attention and the increased anterior PFC activity. Also, it seems unlikely that the age differences in PFC and hippocampal activity seen in these two experiments reflected task difficulty or simple performance differences, because behavioral measures were equivalent in younger and older groups.\nPerformance issues also were a focus of recent work on working and semantic memory in older adults. A study by Mattay et al. (2006) examined the effect of increased working memory load, using a series of n-back tasks, on brain activity, and clarified some of the limits of overrecruitment in older adults. They found a similar distribution of cortical activity between younger and older groups during the n-back tasks; however, there was a significant group difference in dorsolateral PFC bilaterally. In the one-back task, when the older group performed as well as the younger group, the older group showed greater PFC activity. At higher working memory loads, when they performed worse than the younger adults, this relative increase was absent. The authors suggested that compensatory mechanisms, such as additional prefrontal activity, can be called upon to maintain proficiency in task performance, but as cognitive demand increases, compensation cannot be maintained and performance declines. Nielson et al. (2006) looked at a task tapping semantic memory for famous people, in which there were no group differences in accuracy, and both young and old adults scored at better than 90% accuracy levels. Both groups engaged several regions during the task, including the posterior cingulate, right hippocampus, temporal lobe, and left prefrontal regions. Older adults had more extensive and greater magnitude of activation in the left PFC, right medial temporal regions, bilateral lateral temporal cortex, and the right fusiform gyrus. In both studies, overrecruitment of PFC was seen in the context of good performance in older adults, consistent with the idea that older adults recruit additional frontal executive resources to compensate for reductions in other cognitive processes. This additional recruitment also can be found when the task is a relatively easy one for both young and older adults to perform.\nSeveral recent studies looked at source memory, or the influence of source information on memory, which is typically impaired in older adults even if memory for items is not (e.g., Glisky et al. 1995; Hashtroudi et al. 1989; Schacter et al. 1991) . Mitchell et al. (2006) used a somewhat unusual working memory approach to source memory and compared source memory judgments for stimulus format, that is, either picture or word, in young and older adults. Young adults showed activation of an area in the left dorsolateral PFC during source judgments, similar to that reported in previous work (Mitchell et al. 2004 ), but older adults did not. Older adults also were less accurate at these source judgments. The authors posited that older adults' source memory deficits may be related, in part, to reduced function of the left PFC region engaged by young adults. A different result was obtained by Morcom et al. (2007) , who equated overall source memory between groups of healthy younger and older adults by manipulating the number of study presentations and took the additional step of analyzing only those trials in which the source was correctly identified. Contrasts of the activity associated with correct source judgments and correctly identified new items revealed that the two groups recruited many of the same brain regions. However, in older adults, retrieval-related increases in the bilateral anterior PFC and parietal cortex were more widespread and of greater magnitude than that in the young. Given that older adults performed the same as younger adults but had more activation of task-related regions, these findings were interpreted as evidence that there is an age-related decline in the efficiency with which neural populations support cognitive function. Also, comparing the overrecruitment of PFC in this study with the underrecruitment reported by Mitchell et al. emphasizes that age differences in memory performance can influence how one interprets age differences in brain activity. Another study by Gutchess et al. (2007) involved the incidental encoding of pictures of objects presented in meaningful contexts, followed by a memory test for the objects presented in identical or new contexts. The elderly group showed more false alarms than young when new objects were presented in familiar contexts, showing a greater influence of context, or source, on their memory decisions. This behavioral effect was accompanied by reduced activity in cognitive control regions, such as the anterior cingulate, dorsolateral PFC, and parietal regions. However, those older adults who performed better on the task had more right anterior and bilateral ventral PFC activity, an increase not seen in those older adults who performed worse on the task."}, {"section_title": "Executive Functions", "text": "Executive functions, such as attention and inhibition, have not been studied to the same extent as memory, but the experiments done in this area have shown the same basic pattern of results as has been found for memory, that is, that older adults have both decreased and increased activity compared with that of young adults. One early study found that older adults had less PFC activity during tasks requiring inhibition of responses , whereas a second study found more frontal activity in older adults (Nielson et al. 2002) , with the primary difference being that the latter study examined only successful inhibition trials. Other studies have shown failures to suppress brain activity that were attributed to failure to inhibit irrelevant information (Gazzaley et al. 2005; Milham et al. 2002) .\nMore recent work has tended to find increased activity in older than in younger adults. Madden and colleagues (2007) used visual search tasks requiring detection of specific letter targets in an array and extracted functional measures from regions of interest collapsed across hemispheres. They found increased activity in frontal regions, including frontal eye fields, and parietal regions. When the task involved top-down control of the search, performance was correlated with activation in frontal eye fields and superior parietal cortex in the older group, whereas activity in the fusiform gyrus correlated with performance in the young. This age difference in the relation between activation and search performance supported the hypothesis of age differences in how top-down attention is instantiated in neural activity. Townsend et al. (2006) also studied top-down control by using tasks requiring shifting of attention between auditory and visual stimuli. Both young and older adults had increased activity in bilateral frontal and parietal regions associated with cognitive control during the shifting condition, but these regions were activated to a greater degree in older adults, similar to the result of Madden et al. Because the areas with age increases overlapped with areas of activation in young adults, they were interpreted as greater reliance on brain regions typically used by younger adults when task demands are greater, rather than a reorganization of the attention networks.\nA third study used a different approach to studying cognitive control by focusing on default mode regions (Persson et al. 2007) . The default mode is thought to be the type of cognitive activity that people engage in when not carrying out externally driven tasks and includes monitoring of both internal and external milieus (Raichle et al. 2001 ). Default activity is suspended when effort is expended on a task, which in turn engages a different set or sets of brain areas. This taskrelated reduction of activity in default mode regions is smaller in older adults Lustig et al. 2003) . Persson et al. used verb generation tasks varying in selection demands to examine default mode activity in young and older adults. They found equivalent deactivations in young and older adults in a task requiring minimal selection demands, but age reductions in the magnitude of deactivation emerged with increasing demands on selection. These findings are consistent with the previously reported age reductions in the ability to suppress default mode activity, and the results further suggest that this ability is particularly compromised in older adults when tasks demand a high degree of cognitive control. These three studies show that there are age differences in the neural resources underlying attentional control, and that, for a given level of demand, older adults engage attentional processes in frontal/parietal regions to a greater degree than do young adults."}, {"section_title": "Emotion", "text": "A recent trend in cognitive neuroscience research is the study of emotion and emotional memory. Young adults consistently show better memory for emotional than for nonemotional material (Bradley & Baddeley 1990; M. M. Bradley et al. 1992; Carstensen & TurkCharles 1994; Charles et al. 2003; Dewhurst & Parry 2000; Kensinger et al. 2002; Ochsner 2000) , particularly negatively valenced items. Consistent with these behavioral findings, young adults have increased activity in the amygdala when viewing negative emotional stimuli (Anderson et al. 2003; Canli et al. 2000; Critchley et al. 2000; Morris et al. 1998) , and this activity is related to later memory for this material (Cahill et al. 1996; Canli et al. 2000; Dolcos et al. 2004; Kensinger & Corkin 2004) . Older adults may fail to show better memory for negative stimuli Grady et al. 2007 ) and may make more errors in labeling the specific negative emotions in faces than do young adults (Calder et al. 2003; Keightley et al. 2006; MacPherson et al. 2002; McDowell et al. 1994; OscarBerman et al. 1990; Phillips et al. 2002) . Several studies have looked at the neural mechanisms of these age differences in processing negative stimuli, and all have reported lower activity in the amygdala in older adults when viewing negative stimuli than that in young adults (Fischer et al. 2005; Gunning-Dixon et al. 2003; Iidaka et al. 2002; Mather et al. 2004; Tessitore et al. 2005) . One study recently reported no age difference in amygdala activity to negative stimuli, fearful faces in this case (Wright et al. 2006) , although there was less activation of the fusiform gyrus in older adults than in the younger group. One potential confounder in this result, however, is that the fearful faces were not only negatively valenced but also were new, whereas the control faces were both neutral and familiar. The amygdala response was probably influenced both by familiarity and valence (Gobbini & Haxby 2007; Gobbini et al. 2004 ), making it difficult to know which effect had the greater influence on activity in the older adults.\nOther recent studies have pursued this line of research from the viewpoint of age deficits as well as aspects of emotional function that are unchanged with age. One experiment ) used fMRI to explore brain activity in young and old adults while they viewed and labeled faces expressing all the standard emotions as well as neutral expressions. Older adults had significantly greater difficulty identifying negative expressions than did young adults, as noted in earlier studies, but both groups performed at ceiling for happy expressions. Consistent with the superior identification of happy faces, both young and old adults recruited a pattern of brain activity that distinguished happy expressions from all others, but the patterns were age specific. Older adults showed increased activity in the ventromedial PFC, lingual gyrus, and premotor cortex for happy expressions, whereas younger adults recruited a more widely distributed set of regions, including the amygdala, ventromedial PFC, lateral PFC, and bilateral inferior parietal areas. Conversely, younger adults showed more activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate for other types of expressions, and older adults had more activity in the dorsal cingulate, as well as the middle and inferior frontal gyri, somatosensory cortex, and insula. These results support previous research demonstrating age differences in brain activity during emotional processing, including age reductions in the amygdala, and suggest possible age-related differences in cognitive strategy during identification of happy faces, despite no effect of age on this ability.\nIn another study (Urry et al. 2006) older participants carried out a task that required them to either increase or decrease their emotional response to negatively valenced pictures. This type of task in younger adults results in modulation of the amygdala and medial PFC such that decreasing one's emotional response results in decreased amygdala activity and increased activity in the PFC, indicative of a top-down influence on emotional processing. The older group showed a similar response in the amygdala, where activity was increased above control levels for the \"increase\" condition and decreased below control levels for the \"decrease\" condition. However, unlike young adults, the older group had medial and lateral PFC activation for the increase condition, but not the decrease condition. Nevertheless, the inverse relation between the ventromedial PFC and the amygdala was maintained in the older adults. Also, those older adults who were better able to decrease activity in the amygdala and increase activity in the medial PFC showed better diurnal cortisol patterns, indicating a link between regulation of stress responses and modulation of brain regions representing emotional responses.\nAnother study looking at emotion regulation, but in the context of life span changes in regulation, was reported by Williams et al. (2006) . In this study, emotion regulation, as measured by self-reported neuroticism, and brain responses to emotional faces were measured in a sample of individuals ranging from 12 to 79 years of age. Levels of neuroticism were linearly and negatively correlated with age, as was activity in the medial PFC during viewing of happy faces. In contrast, viewing fearful faces was associated with a linear increase of activity in the medial PFC. Activity in the amygdala showed nonlinear changes with age; fear-related amygdala activity was greater in young and middle-aged adults than in older adults, whereas happiness-related activity was greater in young adults and teenagers than in middle-aged and old adults. These findings provide evidence that emotional stability improves from adolescence into older age and is predicted by an increase in controlled processing through the medial PFC of negative emotion, with a corresponding reduction for positive emotion. The authors proposed that changes in motivational priorities and accumulated life experience of older age bring greater selectivity in the perception of positive versus negative emotion, as well as influencing plasticity in the medial prefrontal systems that participate in emotional regulation.\nAlthough not directly addressing emotion per se, a recent study by Samanez Larkin et al. (2007) examined behavioral and brain responses to anticipation of monetary gains and losses. This work was based on the idea that older adults have preserved positive affective experience relative to younger adults but reduced sensitivity to negative affect , so that their anticipatory responses to gains (representing positive affect) would be the same, but age differences should emerge for losses (negative affect). Indeed, they found no age differences in activation of areas representing reward, that is, the striatum and insula, during gain anticipation, but a relative reduction in activation during loss anticipation. These findings show an asymmetry in the processing of gains and losses in older adults that may have implications for decision making and the role of emotion in decision making."}, {"section_title": "Perception", "text": "Finally, two studies looked at the effects of age on visual perceptual function. Such studies have been relatively few but have generally shown a pattern of overrecruitment of activity in some brain areas by older adults, as well as reduced activity in visual cortices (Grady et al. 1994; Madden et al. 2004 ). These studies have indicated that older adults may place relatively greater emphasis on the attentional control of response regulation, in compensation for the age-related decline in visual processing efficiency. In one of the recent studies, Chee et al. (2006) used the phenomenon of fMRI adaptation, which reflects the decrease in activity seen in sensory cortices when a stimulus is repeated (similar to priming and repetition suppression; Buckner et al. 1998; Desimone 1996; Grill-Spector & Malach 2001) . Adaptation is an increasingly popular way to determine the response of brain regions to specific stimulus features. In this particular study, older and younger adults viewed objects placed in background scenes, both of which were either repeated or new. In young adults, there was adaptation to objects in the fusiform and inferior occipital gyri, to background scenes in the parahippocampal gyrus, and contextual binding (adaptation to specific object-scene pairs) in the fusiform, parahippocampus, and hippocampus. Older adults showed neither adaptation to objects in any brain area nor adaptation responses corresponding to binding in the medial temporal areas. They did show adaptation to background scenes in the parahippocampal gyri, as did the young adults. These findings suggest that the elderly have difficulty with simultaneous visual processing of objects and backgrounds that, in turn, could contribute to deficient contextual binding. The auditory working memory study by Grady et al. discussed above (2008) also found less adaptation in older adults; there the adaptation deficit was seen in the auditory cortex to targets in the one-back working memory task (FIG. 1B) . Also, the level of adaptation achieved by the older adults was related to their performance on the task; those older adults who were better able to reduce activity in the auditory cortex to targets showed better detection of the targets (FIG. 1C) . Both experiments indicate that age differences in adaptation might reflect differences in the basic processing of stimulus features that could influence higher-order processes, such as memory. Payer et al. (2006) examined brain activity during processing of faces and houses to examine the relation between altered activity in the visual cortex and prefrontal activity in older adults. These tasks were used because young adults typically have selective activation for faces and houses in different parts of ventral visual cortex (e.g., Haxby et al. 2001; Maurer et al. 2007) . Although both groups showed selective activity for faces and houses, this selectivity was reduced with age, which was interpreted as a type of dedifferentiation of visual function. Also, older adults showed bilateral activation in the prefrontal region, whereas younger adults had right hemisphere activity, although no direct group comparisons were reported. The finding that apparently greater prefrontal activations for the old were concurrent with reduced visual selectivity led the authors to suggest that prefrontal activity may compensate for dedifferentiated object recognition mechanisms in the visual cortex. This supposition is similar to an earlier suggestion (Grady et al. 1994 ) that increased activity in frontal regions occurs in response to decreased activity in visual areas in older adults. "}, {"section_title": "Brain Structure and Function", "text": "Most evidence from studies of brain structure indicates that age differences in both gray and white matter are distributed throughout the brain but are more prominent in frontal than posterior brain areas (Buckner 2004; Raz 2000) . Activity in cortical regions as measured by the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) effect from fMRI could be reduced or altered in older adults because the neurons in the regions themselves are dysfunctional or because the fibers that connect them to other areas are damaged or less efficient. Indeed, the predominant functional changes in the PFC indicate that structural changes seen there might influence activity in widespread areas of the brain that are connected anatomically to frontal regions. The effect of structural changes with age on cognition has been documented (e.g., DeCarli et al. 1995; Garde et al. 2000; Gunning-Dixon & Raz 2000; Pfefferbaum et al. 2000) , and a few studies have recently looked at the effect of these structural changes on functional activation. The results of these studies are not entirely consistent, but they shed some interesting light on brain structure-function relations. In one study, brain activity was measured with fMRI during a flanker task that required inhibition of conflicting information adjacent to a cue indicating the correct response. Gray and white matter density were assessed from structural MRIs (Colcombe et al. 2005) . Older adults had more activation of the left inferior PFC than did younger adults, and this increase was larger in those older adults performing worse on the inhibitory task. The older adults also had lower gray and white matter density in the PFC than those of the young group. There were no differences between good and poor performers in the older group in gray matter density, but the good performers had a higher density of white matter in the corpus callosum and underlying the frontal lobes than did the poor performers. These data suggest that age changes in white matter underlying cortical regions have a greater influence on executive function than changes in the cortex itself-consistent with the idea that integrity of the white matter connecting cortical regions is critical for both cognitive ability and brain function.\nTwo other studies looked at white matter integrity using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which provides a measure of the structural integrity of myelinated white matter tracts (Moseley 2002) . In one of these studies, Persson et al. (2006) studied groups of older adults who were followed up for several years and scanned during a verbal semantic task (abstract/concrete judgment). They found that white matter integrity of the genu of the corpus callosum was reduced in seniors who also showed a decline in memory function over the follow-up period, compared with those whose memory function was stable over this period. Also, activation in the right PFC increased with lower measures of white matter integrity in this region (FIG. 2) , similar to the results of Colcombe et al. The authors suggested that increased cortical activation either is caused by white matter disruption or is a compensatory response to such disruption. Madden et al. (2007) examined brain activity and white matter integrity with DTI during visual search tasks (the previous section also cites this study). They found that white matter measures were reduced in older adults relative to younger adults in several areas, including the genu of the corpus callosum and regions underlying the PFC and parietal cortex. However, these measures did not mediate the age-related increase in activation of the frontal and parietal regions that was observed. A similar result was found by Langenecker et al. (2007) , who obtained both structural volumes and functional measures of the basal ganglia to examine the contribution of these structures to age differences on an inhibitory go-no-go task. Older adults had more activity in the putamen and less in the caudate than did the young adults, but older adults had smaller volumes in both areas. Critically for the question at hand, activation and volumetric measures were not significantly correlated, suggesting that loss of volume in these subcortical regions does not explain the age differences in functional activity or task performance.\nUsing a somewhat different approach, Nordahl et al. (2006) used structural MRI in older adults to quantify the extent of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), which are common in the elderly (Soderlund et al. 2003) and have some deleterious effects on cognition (DeCarli et al. 1995) . In this experiment, the investigators tested whether WMH burden predicted the magnitude of PFC activity observed during performance of episodic and working memory tasks. Increases in dorsal prefrontal WMH volume were associated with decreases in frontal task-related activity, unlike the increased activity associated with loss of white matter integrity found in the studies by Persson et al. and Colcombe et al. discussed earlier. Also, frontal WMH volume was associated with decreased activity not only in the PFC but also in areas such as the medial temporal lobe and posterior parietal cortex. The authors posited that disruption of white matter tracts, especially within the PFC, may be a mechanism for age-related reductions in both memory functioning and brain activation.\nIn addition to age differences in white and gray matter integrity, there is some evidence that age is associated with changes in the vascular system (Hillary & Biswal 2007) and that these vascular changes may influence the hemodynamic BOLD response (Aizenstein et al. 2004; Buckner et al. 2000; D'Esposito et al. 1999; Huettel et al. 2001) . A recent study examining this variability (Handwerker et al. 2007 ) used a breathholding condition as a challenge to estimate the vascular response to hypercapnia. The BOLD responses were measured in young and older adults during a visuomotor saccade task, and the relation between the task-related response and the change in activity during breath holding was assessed. The BOLD response was significantly decreased in the older adults in several areas that mediate saccades, including the frontal eye fields and primary visual cortex. The signal change during the saccade task was linearly related to the change during hypercapnia in both age groups. Also, when the BOLD response during the task was adjusted by dividing it by the signal change during hypercapnia, the only significant age decrease remaining was that in the visual cortex. This result suggests that the BOLD signal decrease with age in this region is neural in origin, whereas the age difference in signal in other regions may be due, in part, to vascular changes. This experiment also provides a relatively simple way of assessing the role of age-related vascular changes in fMRI studies.\nThe results of these studies, taken together, indicate that there is probably some influence of age-related structural and vascular changes on functional measures obtained from the cortex of older adults, but the strength of this influence or whether it is task-or region specific remain to be determined. It is apparent, however, that age reductions in gray or white matter integrity do not necessarily translate into functional reductions. Perhaps the type of change, particularly in the white matter, is critical for the effect seen on the BOLD response. For example, changes in the myelin that are detected with DTI may result in subtle alterations in neural function that can be compensated for by increased activity, whereas disruptions caused by WMH underlying specific cortical regions may be more severe and lead to alterations of function that are more difficult to adapt to. Damage to white matter in the corpus callosum may have a different effect on brain activity than does damage to white matter fibers underlying the cortex. Also, some of the differences in the results noted earlier may be due to the use of a longitudinal rather than a cross-sectional study design. More work on the assessment of change in white matter integrity and functional capacity in older adults will be needed to understand this complex relationship."}, {"section_title": "Cognitive Networks and Aging", "text": "Recently there has been increasing interest in assessing cognitive brain networks by using analytic techniques that facilitate the multivariate identification of whole-brain patterns of activity or that directly assess functional connectivity between brain areas (e.g., Horwitz et al. 1992 ; Lee et al. 2006; McIntosh 1999) . Functional brain networks show evidence of \"smallworld properties\" (Achard et al. 2006; He et al. 2007 ), meaning that they are characterized by dense local connectivity with relatively few long-range connections, resulting in a short path length between any pair of regions in the network. Earlier studies had shown age differences in such neural networks, even when no differences were apparent in behavioral measures or simple task contrasts of brain activity (Della-Maggiore et al. 2000; Grady et al. 2003) . Recently, Achard and Bullmore (2007) examined the efficiency of human brain functional networks in young and older adults scanned in a resting state. Functional connectivity between many cortical and subcortical regions was estimated, and efficiency was defined as a function of the minimum path length between regions. The older adults showed reduced global and local efficiency of these networks, with the local changes seen primarily in orbitofrontal, lateral temporal, and medial temporal regions. Because these cortical regions are thought to be \"hubs,\" or highly interconnected areas, these data suggest that aging reduces the effectiveness of brain function by reducing the efficiency with which these hubs can operate.\nTwo other recent studies examined the effects of older age on motor networks. Taniwaki et al. (2007) examined activity in two previously identified motor loops, one consisting of the basal ganglia, thalamus, and motor cortex and the other involving the cerebellum and its cortical connections. In a prior study, the authors had demonstrated functional interactions within the basal ganglia-thalamus-motor cortex loop during self-initiated movements in young adults and cerebellum-cortical connections loop connectivity during externally triggered movements (Taniwaki et al. 2006) . Interestingly, older adults showed decreased connectivity in both loops during their respective tasks but increased connectivity within motor cortices and between hemispheres during both tasks. These results were interpreted as evidence for an age-related decline of cortico-subcortical connectivity with increased interactions between motor cortices, possibly due to a reduction in interhemispheric inhibitory processes. Wu et al. (2007) also examined motor system networks but did so using connectivity measured during the resting state (Biswal et al. 1995) . A network of regional nodes was specified, based on previous work, and the total amount of connectivity for each region was estimated and compared between young and older adults. Older adults showed a decrease in the amount of functional connectivity in two of the network nodes, the right cingulate motor area and left premotor cortex, compared with young adults. Both this study and that by Taniwaki et al. suggest that aging is associated with reduced function of individual nodes in the motor networks, as well as altered connectivity among the nodes, both of which could be related to reduced motor function in the elderly.\nFinally, a recent study by Stern et al. (in press ) demonstrates a unique approach to the study of cognitive networks and aging. This group has been exploring the concept of cognitive reserve (CR), which some individuals can use to mitigate the effects of aging on cognitive function. For indices of CR, these investigators used vocabulary and IQ scores and determined whether groups of young and old adults would show a common neural network for CR during the performance of two recognition tasks with different cognitive demands (a verbal and a spatial task). A multivariate analysis was used to identify networks of brain regions where activity was associated with the CR measure in the two age groups. During stimulus presentation, there was a pattern of activity that was differently expressed in young and old adults during the verbal task. There also was a common pattern that was related to CR variables in both the verbal and nonverbal tasks in the young group, but it was expressed only in the verbal task by the older group. The authors posited that this latter pattern could represent a general neural network mediating CR that is affected by the aging process and that the former pattern, which was expressed differently by young and old adults, may represent a reorganization of this set of brain areas in compensation for the disruption of the common network brought on by aging.\nThus, all the studies summarized in this section found that aging alters distributed networks of brain activity, either by reducing the efficiency or function of networks seen in young adults or by leading to recruitment of new and perhaps compensatory networks. Also, age-related changes in white matter integrity will affect network connectivity, as well as activation per se, so that the issues discussed earlier regarding structural brain changes will need to be addressed with network approaches."}, {"section_title": "Brain-Behavior Correlations in Older Adults", "text": "This last section of the review will focus on one of the most important questions in the cognitive neuroscience of aging, that is, to determine the effect of age differences in brain activity, such as overrecruitment in older adults, on behavior. Although all studies in this field attempt to interpret their imaging results in terms of the observed behavior, only some of them have directly addressed the relation between brain activity and task performance. Before one reviews the FIGURE 3. Three current explanations for age differences in brain activity are represented schematically. In model A, older adults show more brain activity but the same performance level as younger adults. In model B, the older adults have equal or greater brain activity but worse performance. Both patterns have been interpreted as evidence of less efficient neural processing in the elderly, although Model B could also reflect activity that impairs performance. Model C shows a pattern of effects that is often interpreted as compensatory but might also reflect nonselective brain activity in older adults. Model D presents the strongest evidence for compensation in older adults (see text for fuller explanation of these models). Up-arrows, increase in brain activity, with the magnitude indicated by the size of the arrow; =, equivalent performance in young and old; >,better performance in the younger adults; <, worse performance in the older adults; X, no reliable effect; +r, positive correlation between brain activity and behavior. recent studies that have addressed this issue, it is useful to summarize the explanations for age differences in brain activity that have been invoked most often to date (FIG. 3) . Two types of result have been considered evidence of inefficient use of brain activity in older adults. One is when there is no age difference in behavior but older adults have more activity in taskrelated brain regions than do younger adults (FIG. 3,  model A) . Equal or more brain activity in older adults but poorer performance also could be considered an example of inefficiency, although more activity in the context of poorer performance could indicate that the additional activity impairs performance in the elderly (FIG. 3, model B) . In both cases, the areas activated in young and old would be similar, but older adults are getting \"less bang for the buck.\" When older adults recruit a brain region that is not active in younger adults but have performance equivalent to that seen in young adults, the overrecruitment is generally considered compensatory (FIG. 3, model C) . However, the possibility that this engagement of a new region represents nonselective recruitment or dedifferentiation in the elderly cannot be ruled out entirely. Finally, perhaps the strongest evidence for compensation is the situation in which older adults recruit brain activity that is not seen in younger adults, and the engagement of this area or areas is directly correlated with better performance only in the older adults and not in the young (FIG. 3, model D) . This finding would indicate the recruitment of a unique pattern of neural activity that supports task performance in an age-specific manner. Examples of these patterns have already been noted, such as recruitment of additional PFC regions in the elderly with no age differences in behavior reported by Fernandes et al. (2006) and Daselaar et al. (2006) , consistent with model C in FIGURE 3, and the reduced neural efficiency found by Morcom et al. (2007) , consistent with model A.\nTo address these various possibilities, Zarahn et al. (2007) carried out a study using a recognition task for visually presented letters, with various set sizes. In this experiment there was a pattern of activity expressed by both younger and older adults, but because the older adults had lower mean performance on the task, the use of activation in these regions was considered less efficient (model B). Also, activity in the right parahippocampal gyrus distinguished older from younger adults, with those older adults who performed the slowest on the task showing the most activity in this area (also consistent with model B). A similar result was found by Colcombe et al. (2005) , in that overrecruitment of the left PFC was seen in those adults who performed worse on an inhibitory task. Because the betterperforming elderly in both studies had brain activation more similar to that seen in young adults, these data would not be consistent with the notion of compensation as it is considered typically and, indeed, might even indicate that age-related differences in brain activity impair performance. On the other hand, Zarahn et al. (2007) posited that there might be a type of compensation that could have a beneficial effect on performance, relative to what performance would have been without engagement of an age-specific pattern, even if this pattern is not associated with better task performance in a particular study. That is, those lower-performing older adults who show the largest expression of an agespecific pattern of brain activity would do even worse on the task without this engagement. Rypma et al. (2007) also used a letter recognition task, with various set sizes (similar to that used by FIGURE 4. The sigmoid model of age-related differences in brain-behavior relationships proposed by Rypma et al. (2007) . In this model (axes are hypothetical), the strength of a stimulus representation is related to the degree of PFC activity in a sigmoid fashion, with the maximal difference in representation strength occurring in the midpoint of the curve. This function is right-shifted in older adults, such that more prefrontal activation would be required for older adults to achieve optimum levels of performance (dashed vertical line) than for younger adults (solid vertical line). That is, as neural activity increases, discriminability moves into the optimal range for older adults but into a less optimal range for younger adults. Zarahn et al. 2007) , to examine neural efficiency in older adults. Activity in the PFC increased in response to memory load in both young and older adults, although the older adults were less accurate on the task-consistent with an age reduction in neural efficiency (model B in FIG. 3 , also similar to the result of Zarahn et al.) . However, older adults had better accuracy and faster reaction times with increasing activity in the dorsal PFC, whereas younger adults had better performance with lower levels of activity. This work was interpreted as support for the idea that there is a sigmoid relation between neural activation and the ability to make a decision on the basis of stimulus representations (FIG. 4) . The sigmoid relationship between PFC activation and representation strength means that middle ranges of neural activation result in large differences in signal and easy discrimination between representations. However, the sigmoid function relating neural activation to response may be shifted to the right for older adults compared with younger adults, so that lower levels of activation lead to optimum stimulus discriminability for younger adults but higher levels of activation are needed for optimum discriminability in older adults.\nOther recent studies have reported evidence consistent with the idea of compensatory activity in older adults. Davis et al. (in press) studied younger and older adults during verbal recognition and visual perceptual tasks. The hypothesis was that older adults would show reduced activity in the occipital cortex (as others have reported, e.g., Grady et al. 1994) , increased activity in the PFC, and critically that the overrecruitment of the PFC would be correlated with the degree of underrecruitment of visual areas. The results supported this hypothesis. Older adults had more activity in a region of the PFC than did younger adults, who did not reliably activate this region. Not only was activity in the PFC negatively correlated with occipital activity in older adults but also was positively correlated with performance on the tasks-consistent with the idea that activity in this region was compensating for reduced activity in visual areas (FIG. 3, model D) .\nAlso, one should not focus exclusively on the PFC when examining age differences in brain activity and its relation to behavior. Wierenga et al. (2006) studied naming ability with age, using a task that typically activates the left frontal regions in young adults. Although there was no difference in overall naming accuracy between groups, older adults had more activity in the right inferior frontal gyrus than did the young. Activity in this area positively correlated with greater naming accuracy only in the older group (FIG. 3, model  D) , consistent with the idea that recruitment of the bilateral PFC can be compensatory in older adults (Cabeza 2002) . However, age increases of activity in other right hemisphere regions were not related to better naming, indicating that additional activity per se is not necessarily compensatory in older adults. In contrast, a study by Van der Veen et al. (2006) indicated that activity outside the PFC may be more strongly related to performance in older adults than PFC activity. These investigators examined recognition memory in young and old adults and found that successful retrieval was accompanied by activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus, left precentral gyrus, and right cerebellum regardless of age. Older participants showed additional activity in the bilateral medial PFC and right parahippocampal gyrus. Further analyses showed that only the additional parahippocampal activation correlated positively with task performance in the older group (again consistent with FIG. 3, model D) , suggesting that activation in this area served the purpose of functional compensation even though PFC activity did not. Now one might wonder how compensation in the elderly actually works and which cognitive processes are engaged. A recent model of how compensation FIGURE 5. The load-shift model of cognitive aging proposed by Velanova et al. (2007) . Memory retrieval is considered to be a set of processes automatically elicited by a cue that are constrained by early-selection processes and edited by late-selection processes. Resources, represented by circles, can be expended at early-and late-selection stages to aid effective memory retrieval. (A) Young adults are hypothesized to rely on a combination of early-and late-selection processes, with more resources used to constrain processing through top-down mechanisms at early-selection stages. (B) Because of compromise in executive function, older adults fail to constrain processing at the early-selection stage. As a result, representations are poorly constrained. (C) To compensate, older adults expend greater resources to edit the retrieval event at late-selection stages. might evolve during memory retrieval was proposed by Velanova et al. (2007) . According to this model, executive and cognitive control resources are required both early in the retrieval process and late in retrieval (FIG. 5) . Young adults can engage early resources to constrain the amount of information necessary to determine whether a stimulus is old or new, and hence there is less demand on later processes. However, with aging there is a reduction in these early resources so that more reliance on later resources, so called backend processing, is needed to compensate. Support for this model was found in two experiments of word recognition in which an age-related increase was found in both the ventral and dorsal PFC that appeared to occur after parietal activity that indicated that a successful retrieval decision had been reached. This is an interesting hypothesis that would account for some of the results reviewed here, although it will need further testing. For example, the proposed age deficit in early top-down processing will need to be distinguished from any age differences in early bottom-up attentional changes.\nFinally, a critical question is whether age differences in brain activity thought to be compensatory can be elicited through training of specific cognitive processes in older adults. That is, if overrecruitment of the PFC is compensating for some age decline in brain structure or function, then in older adults who are trained on a particular task, and thereby improve their performance, prefrontal activity should increase accordingly. This process would increase age differences in prefrontal activity when scanning is done after training. On the other hand, training may reduce the effort needed for older adults to perform the task or result in older adults using behavioral strategies more like those used by younger adults, thus reducing age differences in brain activity. These alternatives have not been studied yet to any great degree, but one recent study examined this issue in the context of training on a dual-task paradigm. In this study, participants carried out two visual tasks (color detection and letter detection) either singly or simultaneously (Erickson et al. 2007) . A subset of young and older adults then received 5 h of training on the tasks over several weeks. Both young and old trained groups showed improved performance on the tasks, both in accuracy and reaction times. In pretraining brain activity, young adults had more activity in the left ventral PFC than the older group, and older adults had more activity in the dorsal PFC bilaterally than did the young. After training, older adults showed an increase in left ventral PFC activity and a decrease in dorsal PFC activity, such that age differences in these regions were no longer apparent. Also, these changes in prefrontal activity were correlated with improved reaction time on the dual task in the older adults. This result does not support the idea that behavioral improvement after training on these tasks was associated with compensatory increases of frontal activity to levels above that seen in younger adults. Instead, activity in the older adults after training was more similar to that seen in the young group. One explanation for these findings is that older adults before training needed more cognitive control to perform the dual tasks, indicated by more dorsal prefrontal activity, and that the training allowed them to reduce their dependence on these control processes.\nThe studies reviewed here showed a variety of brain-behavior correlations, similar to those reported in earlier studies, ranging from inefficiency to compensation in the elderly. Unfortunately, it is proving difficult to precisely determine in older adults the effect of overrecruitment of the PFC, or engagement of different patterns of brain activity, using cross-sectional comparisons with younger adults. This difficulty could be due to relatively small samples chosen from a heterogeneous older population, task, or regional specificity of brain-behavior relations; the influence of unmeasured factors such as genotype or personality; or perhaps a combination of these factors. Also, some studies have assessed the relation between brain activity and reaction times, whereas others have looked at accuracy, and these two behavioral measures do not necessarily show the same relation with brain activity (e.g., Lenartowicz & McIntosh 2005) . More studies will need to be done to address this issue by using other kinds of tasks, as well as to determine more precisely the effects of training on brain activity in young and older adults."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Over the past two decades, we have learned quite a bit about how cognitive aging is reflected in the brain, and the studies published in the past year have supported the basic conclusions drawn from earlier ones. In general, studies done to date find many similarities in the patterns of activity in young and old adults, indicating that basic neural mechanisms are maintained into older age. Despite these overall similarities, older adults often have less activity in some regions, such as medial temporal areas during memory encoding or retrieval and visual regions across a variety of cognitive domains. It seems clear that age reductions in cognitive function can be tied, at least in part, to these reductions in brain activity. For example, reduced hippocampal activity could result in less effective encoding as well as reduced levels of recollection at retrieval, because the hippocampus has been tied to both processes (e.g., Nadel et al. 2000; Squire 1992 ). On the other hand, older adults typically also overrecruit some brain areas, mainly the ventral or dorsal PFC during memory tasks, and both frontal and parietal regions during tasks engaging cognitive control processes, such as attention.\nSometimes this overrecruitment appears to be in response to altered function in other brain regions, such as the hippocampus or sensory cortices, and is often seen in those older adults who perform better on the task at hand. These findings have provided rather convincing support for the idea that overrecruitment can be compensatory in the elderly. Nevertheless, not all age increases can be interpreted as compensatory, and some are more indicative of neural inefficiency. Also, the recent training study reviewed here (Erickson et al. 2007) indicates that improving performance through training does not necessarily lead to increased activity in the PFC but may actually result in less activity, thereby reducing age differences. The result of training will probably depend on whether the training leads to greater automaticity, in which case PFC activity would be expected to decrease, or learning of a new way to apply cognitive control, in which case PFC activity would be expected to increase.\nIt is worth considering whether the evidence accumulated so far has indicated any specific prefrontal region or regions as being major players in compensatory mechanisms. A recent review of episodic and working memory experiments (Rajah & D'Esposito 2005) concluded that aging results in the dedifferentiation of function, or loss of task selectivity, in bilateral ventral prefrontal regions and deficits in function in the right dorsal PFC. The authors further suggested that even when older adults recruit the right dorsal frontal area that this does not help them perform the task but that activity in the left dorsal and anterior PFC may be compensatory. The studies reviewed here are broadly consistent with these conclusions. For example, most found greater activation of the left PFC in older than in younger adults that was often associated with good performance in the older group, although this was seen in both the left dorsolateral and ventrolateral areas. The regional and hemispheric differences that have been reported in this field probably reflect the engagement of different cognitive processes, but what these exact processes are or what one must do to elicit them still is not clear. Models of how compensation might take place, such as the one by Velanova et al. (2007) reviewed here, are a welcome addition to the field and will, it is hoped, stimulate more research into the timing and mechanisms of compensation, as well as the regions mediating these effects.\nAn important methodological consideration is that most of the studies of cognitive aging and brain activity have used cross-sectional designs and contrasted younger and older adults. Only a few have reported longitudinal data, although the advantages of this approach in avoiding cohort effects and examining within-subject age-related declines are obvious. One group that has been able to take a longitudinal approach to brain function in aging is the group examining data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. In this large longitudinal study, a group of older adults who maintained good physical and cognitive health were followed up for 8 years and underwent five scanning sessions (every other year) during rest and delayed verbal and figural recognition memory tasks (Beason-Held et al. in press-a, in press-b) . Although memory performance remained stable over the 8 years, longitudinal changes in brain activity were seen. Longitudinal decreases common to all scan conditions were seen in the anterior cingulate, superior temporal, and subcortical regions, whereas increases were seen in the PFC and hippocampus. Some of these changes were linear (e.g., the superior temporal gyrus), and others appeared as step changes in one year or another (e.g., the PFC). Task-specific changes also were noted. These data, in view of the stable memory performance, suggest that there are distinctive patterns of age-related functional decline and compensatory activity over time. PFC activity increased over time in this older sample, consistent with the cross-sectional increases seen in PFC activity relative to young adults. Data such as these can be valuable, although difficult to obtain, so it is not clear that many such longitudinal studies will be done.\nFinally, activity reductions and/or increases in older adults are unlikely to be the whole story. The few studies that have examined functional networks indicate that distributed patterns of brain activity also are altered in older adults. Functional and anatomical connectivity will have to be taken into account before we fully understand the brain mechanisms underlying cognitive aging. This type of approach, although more difficult to carry out and interpret than univariate contrasts of brain activity across tasks or conditions, nevertheless holds promise for capturing the complexity of brain function. Also, the influence of structural changes is far from clear and will need further work to determine whether there is an influence, which structural measure (e.g., white matter or gray matter) is most closely related to activation, and what form the influence will take (i.e., leading to an increase or decrease of activity). So, despite the wealth of data accumulated over the past decade on the aging brain, we still have a long way to go. One challenge facing future research will be to understand the task conditions that promote compensation in older adults, the role of the various brain areas in aiding cognitive function, and how these compensatory mechanisms can be elicited to enhance quality of life in the elderly."}]
