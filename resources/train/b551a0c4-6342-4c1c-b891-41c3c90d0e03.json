[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Motivation: Brain imaging genetics, which studies the linkage between genetic variations and structural or functional measures of the human brain, has become increasingly important in recent years. Discovering the bi-multivariate relationship between genetic markers such as singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and neuroimaging quantitative traits (QTs) is one major task in imaging genetics. Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (SCCA) has been a popular technique in this area for its powerful capability in identifying bi-multivariate relationships coupled with feature selection. The existing SCCA methods impose either the ' 1 -norm or its variants to induce sparsity. The ' 0 -norm penalty is a perfect sparsity-inducing tool which, however, is an NP-hard problem. Results: In this paper, we propose the truncated ' 1 -norm penalized SCCA to improve the performance and effectiveness of the ' 1 -norm based SCCA methods. Besides, we propose an efficient optimization algorithms to solve this novel SCCA problem. The proposed method is an adaptive shrinkage method via tuning s. It can avoid the time intensive parameter tuning if given a reasonable small s. Furthermore, we extend it to the truncated group-lasso (TGL), and propose TGL-SCCA model to improve the group-lasso-based SCCA methods. The experimental results, compared with four benchmark methods, show that our SCCA methods identify better or similar correlation coefficients, and better canonical loading profiles than the competing methods. This demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods in discovering interesting imaging genetic associations."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Brain imaging genetics has gained more and more attentions in recent years. Using the quantitative endophenotype, other than the error-prone cutoffs to define case-control status, as the target measure can improve the performance in identifying disease related genetic markers (Kim et al., 2013; Potkin et al., 2009; Saykin et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2010 Shen et al., , 2014 . A major task of imaging genetics is to identify bi-multivariate associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and imaging quantitative traits (QTs). As an ideal computational model, sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA), which is powerful in discovering bi-multivariate relationships and selecting relevant features, has become a popular technique in brain imaging genetics (Chen and Liu, 2012; Chen et al., 2012 Chen et al., , 2013 Du et al., 2014 Du et al., , 2016a Parkhomenko et al., 2009; Witten et al., 2009) .\nThe canonical correlation analysis (CCA) technique has been proposed to learn the associations between two views of data (Hotelling, 1936) . However, CCA suffers from severe overfitting issue because its performance decreases significantly once the number of features is larger than that of the observations. ) introduced the ' 1 -norm into the CCA model to pursuit sparse canonical loadings. This is a desired property because it only selects a small proportion of the features which are meaningful for further investigation. After that, many sparse CCA methods using the ' 1 -norm or its variants such as the fused lasso are proposed, and they have been successfully applied to different biology applications (Shen et al., 2014) . However, there are two major concerns regarding these SCCA methods. First, the ' 1 -norm pursuits sparsity at the price of shrinking large features by a constant. This may incurs estimation bias and thus decrease the prediction power. Second, the ' 0 -norm is the most ideal sparsity-inducing constraint, which only includes those nonzero features. Unfortunately, the ' 0 -norm function is neither non-convex nor discontinuous. Nevertheless, it is known to be an NP-hard (nondeterministic polynomial time) problem (Fung and Mangasarian, 2011) . In addition, the ' 1 -norm constraint is not a stable feature selector (Fan and Li, 2001 ). Group lasso is widely used to model the group structure by considering each group of variables as a whole (Yuan and Lin, 2006) . Actually, group lasso is a ' 1 -norm constraint at the group level, and within each group a ' 2 -norm is used. Therefore, group lasso is limited by the same problems to that of ' 1 -norm. For example, group lasso shrinks large groups by a constant which may lead to biased results.\nIn order to address these issues, the likelihood-based selector, named the truncated ' 1 -norm penalty (TLP) (Shen et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2012) , is proposed. The TLP is defined as J s jxj \u00f0 \u00de \u00bc min\u00f0 jxj s ; 1\u00de where s is a small positive tuning parameter. TLP plays the role of the surrogate of ' 0 -norm. It could approximate the ' 0 -norm function and permits the desirable sparsity by providing a reasonable s. At the same time, TLP can be equivalently transferred to a piecewise linear function, and thus is easier to handle than the ' 0 -norm function. Besides, the TLP can be easily extended to the truncated group lasso to provide an improved group feature selector.\nWith the above observations, we explore the effect of using TLP and TGL in the SCCA model. We first propose the TLP based SCCA (TLP-SCCA) which embraces the TLP norm instead of the ' 0 -norm or the ' 1 -norm. The TLP-SCCA has the following advantages (Shen et al., 2012) . First, the TLP function performs as a tradeoff between the ' 0 and ' 1 function. This means that it not only has better feature selection ability, but also can be solved effectively like the ' 1 -norm. Second, it is an adaptive shrinkage method if s is tuned appropriately. Third, using an appropriate s, it can discriminate the small coefficients from large coefficients, and leave those large ones less penalized. We propose an effective optimization algorithm to solve the TLP-SCCA problem. In addition, we extend TLP-SCCA to the truncated group lasso penalized SCCA, aiming to boost the existing methods using group lasso. The experimental results, compared with three state-of-the-art ' 1 -SCCA methods (Chen and Liu, 2012; Du et al., 2014; Witten et al., 2009) and one group lasso penalized SCCA method (Du et al., 2014) , show that both TLP-SCCA and TGL-SCCA exhibit better canonical loading profiles than these benchmark methods, and also obtain higher or similar correlation coefficients."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": "We use the boldface lowercase letter to denote a vector, and use the boldface uppercase letter to denote a matrix. jj \u00c1 jj indicates the ' 2 -norm of a vector.

Then the penalized CCA model using ' 1 -norm is defined\nwhere X u \u00f0 \u00de and X v \u00f0 \u00de are the ' 1 -norm functions which can control model sparsity (Parkhomenko et al., 2009; Witten and Tibshirani, 2009 )."}, {"section_title": "The truncated ' 1 -norm", "text": "The ' 1 regularization for lasso is widely used as a convex relaxation of the ' 0 -norm function (Yang et al., 2012) . Though lasso regularizer yields sparse solutions, it may incur estimation bias because it overpenalizes large coefficients. The truncated ' 1 -norm is defined as follows (Zhang, 2013) :\nThe parameter s is a predefined threshold or tuning parameter. Given an appropriate s, TLP balances between the ' 1 -norm and the ' 0 -norm according to the magnitude of u i' s. It is equivalent to the ' 1 -norm if the coefficient is small enough (ju i j s), while it becomes the ' 0 -norm as the coefficient goes beyond the threshold s (ju i j > s)."}, {"section_title": "Smoothing the penalty", "text": "Since TLP is non-convex, we first decompose it into two continuous functions, and then show how to approximate TLP by a quadratic function.

Thus we do not assume X > X to be an identity. According to the definition, TLP-SCCA transforms between ' 0 -SCCA and ' 1 -SCCA depending on the relationship between s and the magnitude of the coefficients. Thus its merits are 3-fold. Firstly, it has both better sparsity-inducing ability and lower estimation bias than the ' 1 -SCCA since it approximates the optimal ' 0 -SCCA. Secondly, TLP-SCCA is guaranteed to perform well as long as s is small enough. This is desirable because it avoids the time-consuming procedure to fine-tune s, especially in highdimensional biology study. Thirdly, it is easier to solve than the intractable ' 0 -SCCA.\nThe unconstrained formulation of the TLP-SCCA problem writes\nwhere c 1 , and c 2 are the tuning parameters.

Therefore, we use both ' 1 -SCCA and GL-SCCA as benchmarks. We are aware of that there are three kinds of ' 1 -SCCA which are implemented by different optimization techniques. To make a thorough comparison, we employ all three methods in this paper. They are the singular value decomposition based method , the the excessive gap method which pursuits the optimum by keeping decreasing the dual gap (Chen and Liu, 2012) , and the alternative search based method (Du et al., 2014) . To facilitate the description, we call the three ' 1 -SCCA methods L1-SCCA ), L1-NSCCA (Chen and Liu, 2012) and L1-S2CCA (Du et al., 2014) . As for group SCCA methods, except S2CCA (group lasso based SCCA) (Du et al., 2014) , those GL-SCCA methods assume that\nThe reason is that in real applications neighboring SNPs are correlated with one another, which implies that both in-set covariance matrices are not identical. Thus we compare TGL-SCCA with S2CCA in this study. For both methods, the group information is provided in advance. 9: t t \u00fe 1. 10: end while 3.1.2 Parameter tuning There are four parameters, i.e. k 1 , k 2 , c 1 and c 2 , in both TLP-SCCA and TGL-SCCA algorithms except for the threshold parameter s. We note that s is the most important parameter in our models as it balances between the ' 0 -norm and ' 1 -norm based penalties. According to the definition, TLP-SCCA reduces to L1-SCCA if given a too large s, i.e. s > max i ju i j. On the contrary, a too small s, i.e. s < min i ju i j, makes TLP-SCCA reduce to the unpenalized CCA. Therefore, we search the optimal s from a moderate range, i.e. [0.01, 0.05, \u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1, 1] for TLP-SCCA in this paper. In the Supplementary Material section, we will conduct a series of experiments to show the performance trajectories under different s's. Similarly, TGL-SCCA reduces to the conventional group lasso based SCCA if s > max k jjG k jj; or becomes the group lasso based CCA if s < min k jjG k jj, which will not yield sparse results. Therefore, the s for TGL-SCCA is tuned from [0.5, 0.55, \u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1, 1.5]. Further, we know that the regularization parameters for both TLP and TGL functions are k1 s and k2 s . That is, simultaneously changing k 1 and s will not affect penalization strength, e.g. . Therefore, we fix k 1 \u00bc k 2 \u00bc 1 in this paper. Finally, we optimally tune c 1 and c 2 by the grid search strategy spanning from 10 \u00c02 to 10 2 . The 5-fold nested cross-validation strategy is employed, in which the inner loop pursuits the best parameters and training and testing results are obtained from the outer loop. All methods run on the same partition and the same platform to make a fair comparison.\nWe set the stopping criterion of Algorithm 1 to max i ju\n, where is the desirable estimation error bound. is empirically set to 10 \u00c05 according to experiments."}, {"section_title": "Results on synthetic data", "text": "We generate four datasets with different properties to assess the performance of these SCCA methods. The four datasets have different signals and correlation coefficients. We also set the number of observations to be smaller than the number of variables. The datasets are generated as follows. We first set up u and v, respectively. Then we generate a latent variable z from Gaussian distribution N 0; I n\u00c2n \u00f0 \u00de . After that, data matrix X is generated according to\nThe data matrix Y is created similarly by y i $ N\u00f0z i v; P y \u00de, where\n\u00c0jvj\u00c0v k j . Now we list the details of the four datasets. (i) The first dataset has 250 variables for X and 600 ones for Y. Its true correlation coefficient is 0.62. (ii) The second one also has 250 variables and 600 ones for X and Y, respectively. Its correlation coefficient is 0.84, and its true signal pattern is different. (iii) The third dataset has 250 variables for X and 600 variables for Y. But its correlation coefficient (0.75) and true signal pattern are different from the previous two datasets. (iv) The fourth dataset has 500 variables for X side and 900 for Y side. Its correlation coefficients is 0.65. The true signal of each dataset is shown in Figure 1 (top row).\nWe present the trained canonical loadings of all SCCA methods in Figure 1 . Obviously, both TLP-SCCA and L1-SCCA successfully identify the true signals embedded in the data. However, L1-SCCA has more small irrelevant signals than our method. The L1-NSCCA only find out incomplete signals for most u and v, and L1-S2CCA performs inconsistently across 5-folds. This demonstrates that TLP-SCCA outperforms those benchmarks in identifying accurate canonical loadings. For structured methods, they both perform consistently on all four datasets, showing their ability in extraction of grouping features. In Table 1 , we also show the correlation coefficients estimated from both training and testing data, where a higher value stands for a better performance. We use the boldface to highlight the best values. On both training and testing sets, we observe that TLP-SCCA obtains almost all the best correlation coefficients, which means it performs better than those ' 1 -SCCA methods consistently. In addition, we observe that TGL-SCCA performs similarly to the GL-S2CCA on the training set. However, it outperforms GL-S2CCA on the testing set. This is more desirable since the better testing performance is truly what we want to use to evaluate a learning method. In summary, on these diverse simulation data, for the individual sparsity, TLP-SCCA performs better than or equal to the ' 1 -norm based SCCA methods on not only the correlation coefficients but also the canonical loadings profiles. For the group sparsity, TGL-SCCA and GL-S2CCA hold similar canonical loading profiles, but TGL-SCCA obtains better testing canonical correlation coefficients."}, {"section_title": "Results on real neuroimaging genetics data", "text": "We also compared TLP-SCCA with three ' 1 -SCCA methods using real neuroimaging and genetics (SNP) data. The real brain imaging genetics data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheime's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. One crucial goal of the ADNI is to test if serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD. For up-to-date information, please refer to www.adni-info.org. The ADNI cohort studied in this work contained 176 AD, 363 MCI and 304 healthy control (HC) non-Hispanic Caucasian participants. Structural MRI scans had been processed with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in SPM. Generally, all scans had been aligned to a T1-weighted template image, segmented into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) maps, normalized to MNI space and had been smoothed with an 8 mm FWHM kernel. In the experiment setup we subsampled the whole brain, and aimed to examine associations between the voxels (GM density measures) and SNPs, thus we did not merely use ROI summary statistics. On the account of this point, we could obtain more detailed results. Totally 465 voxels spanning all brain ROIs were extracted as imaging data. In addition, the impacts of the baseline age, gender, education and handedness had been also eliminated through regression analysis. For the genotyping data, we used 58 SNP biomarkers from the ADrelated genes such APOE, TOMM40 and PVRL2, in which APOE e4 SNP rs429358 is the best-known AD genetic risk factor (Ramanan et al., 2014) . We intend to evaluate the correlations between the voxels data and the APOE SNP data using the SCCA methods.\nWe first show the heat maps of the canonical loadings estimated from the training set in Figure 2 . In this figure, each row corresponds to a participant method. The estimated canonical loading u, indicating weights for SNPs, is shown on the left panel and the estimated v containing weights for the imaging markers is shown on the right. We observe that TLP-SCCA shows a very clear picture with respect to both canonical loadings. It only highlights the APOE e4 SNP rs429358 on the genetic side. This locus is well known to be related to AD. On the imaging side, TLP-SCCA only captures one voxel out of 465 ones. The highlight region is the hippocampus which is highly correlated with AD (Hampel et al., 2008) . However, the benchmark methods report many signals which may misguide further investigation. We can also observe that the performances of these competing methods are not stable as they perform differently on the 5-fold results. While TLP-SCCA has more stable and consist results than those ' 1 -SCCA methods.\nIn Figure 2 , the last two rows, which shows the canonical weights from two structured SCCA methods, clearly exhibit a group structure on both genetic side and imaging side. They both identify all the SNPs in the 7th group for the genotypic data, showing their relevance to the AD. This group of loci are rs283814 (PVRL2), rs157580 (TOMM40), rs2075650 (TOMM40), rs157582 (TOMM40), rs8106922 (TOMM40), rs1160985 (TOMM40), rs405697 (TOMM40), rs405509 (APOE) and rs769449 (APOE). They all locate in the APOE region (i.e. the best known AD risk region) and most of them have been independently reported to be associated with Alzheimer's disease or human longevity (Abraham et al., 2008; Denny et al., 2013; Harold et al., 2009; Kalra et al., 2008; Kamboh et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2013; Soerensen et al., 2013) . Strangely, both group methods do not report the locus rs429358 as a risk factor. One possible reason could be that all the nine loci in the 7th group are associated with AD, and their combined effects might be much higher than that of the 8th group where the rs429358 is located. Since both structured methods are sparse at the group level, they only consider the 7th group of loci with the highest influence as risk factors. Now we investigate the imaging markers. TGL-SCCA and GL-S2CCA find out the group of signals from the hippocampus, in which atrophy is an evidence of AD (Hampel et al., 2008) . Besides, they identify small signals from the frontal region, the inferior temporal gyrus and the precentral gyrus, and all of these three regions have been reported to be associated with AD (Chan et al., 2001; Mattsson et al., 2017; Stuss et al., 1992; Woodward et al., 2010) . To show the canonical loadings clearly, we map the averaged canonical loadings regarding the imaging measurements onto the brain. Supplementary Figure S3 clearly shows that L1-SCCA highlights most parts of the whole brain followed by L1-NSCCA, while TLP-SCCA only highlights a small region. Both GL-SCCA and TGL-SCCA highlight more voxels than TLP-SCCA due to their group constraint. Table 2 exhibits both training and testing correlation coefficients where each individual result and its mean and standard deviation are shown. Obviously, TLP-SCCA yields the best mean 6 std on both training and testing. Moreover, TLP-SCCA is more stable than L1-S2CCA and L1-NSCCA. Interestingly, both group SCCA methods obtain smaller but more stable than those ' 1 -norm and TLP based methods. And, TGL-SCCA reveals higher correlation than the GL-S2CCA, indicating its improved performance. In summary, TLP-SCCA accurately reveals a biologically meaningful correlation between APOE SNP rs429358 and the GM density of hippocampus, an AD related brain region, and TGL-SCCA identify group associations between genetic loci and imaging markers. Therefore, SCCA methods using the truncated lasso or group lasso have better detection ability than those with lasso and group lasso."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have proposed a robust and efficient SCCA method (TLP-SCCA) which is flexible and can avoid time consuming parameter tuning.

We also have extended it to the truncated group lasso based SCCA (TGL-SCCA) to improve the existing group SCCA methods.\nWe compared TLP-SCCA, with three ' 1 -SCCA with different optimization techniques, and compared TGL-SCCA with the GL-SCCA. The results on four diverse synthetic datasets revealed that TLP-SCCA obtained comparable correlation coefficients on the training sets and higher correlation coefficients on the testing sets. Besides, TLP-SCCA identified clearer canonical loadings than three ' 1 -SCCA methods, and accurately recovered the true signals embedded in the data. The TGL-SCCA obtained better results than the GL-SCCA in terms of both correlation coefficients and canonical weights. The result on the real imaging genetic data showed that TLP-SCCA generated higher correlation coefficients on both training and testing sets. It also had the best canonical weights because the patterns are very clear and clean. That is, TLP-SCCA discovered a biologically meaningful bimultivariate association between the hippocampus region and the APOE e4 genetic locus. As for the group methods, our TGL-SCCA outperformed GL-SCCA on both canonical coefficient and the canonical weights patterns. Besides individual and group sparsity, the network structure is also of great interest and importance in imaging genetics. Therefore, in the future work, we will impose related structure penalty into our model to accommodate this issue."}]
