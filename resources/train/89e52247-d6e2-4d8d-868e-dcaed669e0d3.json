You will find links throughout this document that will direct you to the internet for more information, including websites, publications, and fact sheets. There are references listed at the end that identify the sources of the information in this document. While this summary is limited to existing information and is therefore not a substitute for on-the-ground survey and assessment, it provides a starting point for recognizing important natural areas in your town and in the surrounding areas. Effective conservation occurs across property and political boundaries and therefore necessitates a broader view of natural landscapes. By identifying areas of high-quality resources, this summary will be especially useful for setting priorities that support town planning. Habitat summaries like this one have been used by other communities for open space plans, comprehensive plans, natural resource inventories, and developing critical environmental areas. One Hudson Valley town used the species lists in its comprehensive plan's generic environmental impact statement. Some communities have incorporated their summaries directly into plans, while others use the information to write their own documents. Though this summary does not contain the detail needed for site planning, it is useful for environmental review. First, a good inventory makes it easier to review projects. By identifying high quality habitats at the town-wide scale, it helps land use decision-makers and applicants understand how a proposed site plan might relate to important areas off-site. Second, the summary informs environmental review by highlighting areas that might need a more detailed assessment. Third, the species lists identify species of conservation concern you may want to address during your reviews. Please note that some of the habitats and species identified in this document may be protected by state or federal programs. Continue to work with the DEC Region 4 office in Schenectady and other appropriate agencies on those issues."}, {"section_title": "Conservation", "text": "Once you understand the kinds of habitats in your town, you may want to identify conservation actions that protect the resources in order to protect the benefits they provide to the community. Included with this summary are General Conservation Measures for Protecting Natural Areas and Wildlife that can help guide Ancram's plans and land-use decisions. More detailed information on the how and why of local habitat conservation is available in Conserving Natural Areas in Your Community: Smart Growth Strategies for Protecting the Biological Diversity of New York's Hudson River Valley (Strong 2008). The handbook was published by NYSDEC to support the Hudson River Estuary Biodiversity Outreach Program. It describes in more detail why towns should conserve their biological resources, as well as the tools and techniques that local governments can use to conserve natural areas and wildlife. Chapter 5 covers habitat conservation. The document is also available in CD or hard copy upon request."}, {"section_title": "Species and Habitats of Conservation Concern", "text": "Following the general descriptions of habitat, you will find lists of species of state-wide conservation concern that have been recorded for the town to date. There are likely other state-rare species in Ancram that are not yet documented. Species on the lists come from the NY Natural Heritage Program, the New York Amphibian and Reptile Atlas, and the NYS Breeding Bird Atlas. Species are included if they are on the state or federal endangered and threatened species list, listed as a Species of Greatest Conservation Need in New York's Wildlife Action Plan, recognized as a \"responsibility species\" for the Hudson Valley by Audubon New York, or are other indicators of high quality habitat. We have some information about species and habitats of regional conservation concern, primarily from the Farmscape Ecology Program at Hawthorne Valley Farm (FEP). FEP has been working in Columbia County to understand the relationship between agriculture, natural areas, and socio-economics. The extensive fieldwork of FEP researchers throughout the county makes them an especially useful source for this summary. Information from the program is distributed throughout. Tables 3 and 4 are lists of species of regional conservation concern, compiled from information provided by the Farmscape Ecology Program. Regional conservation concern means the species or habitat is rare or uncommon at the Hudson Valley, county, or town scale, more detailed definitions are provided in the tables themselves."}, {"section_title": "How to find more information", "text": "The information in this summary can be enhanced by local knowledge. Local studies, maps, plans, and knowledgeable local people can add to detail to these areas, and may reveal unknown, high-quality ecosystems. Biological information in environmental impact statements may be useful, especially when a town has standards for environmental review. In Ancram, the habitat map created by town residents in 2001 looked at the north central part of town, including areas for which we have little data. As town volunteers continue mapping habitat in the town, this habitat summary will be useful in identifying mapping priorities. If you want help with incorporating additional information into the summary, please contact Karen Strong, Biodiversity Outreach Coordinator."}, {"section_title": "Important habitats of the Town of Ancram", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Major Natural Features", "text": "The first step to understanding the major natural features of Ancram is to consider the town's place in relation to the regional features that extend beyond its borders. Figure 1 shows where Ancram lies in the Roeliff Jansen Kill and Stockport Creek watersheds, as well as regionally significant landscapes identified by the NYSDEC Hudson River Estuary Program in Penhollow et al. (2006). Ancram has two of those landscapes, known as significant biodiversity areas: the Harlem Valley Calcareous Wetlands and the Taconic Ridge. The major natural features map ( Figure 2) shows where the significant biodiversity areas are in Ancram as well as areas important for the health of known state-rare plants and animals and significant ecosystems."}, {"section_title": "Harlem Valley Calcareous Wetlands", "text": "The Harlem Valley wetlands run along the eastern-most New York State in Columbia, Dutchess, and Putnam Counties (Figure 1), and cover a large portion of Ancram ( Figure 2). This regionally significant landscape is identified as a significant biodiversity area by the NYSDEC Hudson River Estuary Program for the many uncommon plants, animals, and habitats associated with its calcium-rich bedrock and dynamic geologic history (Penhollow et al., 2006): Calcium-rich Wetlands Large, high-quality wetlands and wetland complexes are found throughout the Harlem Valley in Ancram, including the wetlands associated with Miller Pond and Drowned Lands Swamp that have two red mapletamarack peat swamps (50 and 70 acres), a 69 acre shallow emergent marsh with good diversity, and several small fens. Additional small fens are located along the border with the Town of Northeast. Many other state and regionally rare plants and animals are found in Ancram's Harlem Valley wetlands. The only known Columbia County populations of state-listed swamp birch, handsome sedge, and marsh valerian are in Drowned Lands Swamp and the wetlands south of Miller Pond. Known wildlife of conservation concern include the spotted turtle (in abundance), bog turtle, marsh fern moth, the harvester butterfly (rare in Columbia County), and spotted salamander, a vernal pool indicator that is regionally vulnerable (Kiviat and Stevens 2001). Timber rattlesnakes are associated with the Taconic Ridge, but use habitat in the Harlem Valley seasonally for foraging on rodents."}, {"section_title": "Calcium-rich Uplands", "text": "The Farmscape Ecology Program has explored several examples of calcium-rich uplands in Ancram. Several regionally-rare plants are found in the limestone woodland at Drowned Lands Swamp, including round-leaved dogwood, four-leaved milkweed, and upland boneset (Table 3). A calcareous talus slope woodland south of Route 82, has a diverse plant community rich in rare and uncommon native species, including a number of regionally-rare ferns, and four-toed salamander. Finally, red cedar woodlands can be botanically interesting because they tend to develop on abandoned agricultural lands on thin, calcium-rich soils and are often associated with uncommon native plants. One such example was found south of Drowned Lands Swamp and had the regionally-rare shrubby cinquefoil, showy goldenrod, and pale beardtongue. The complete list of state-rare species and significant ecosystems known from this area in Ancram is shown in Table 1. Table 3 lists known local and regional rarities. Calcareous, or calcium-rich areas have the potential to support many unique plants and plant communities. This description of the calcium-rich areas in Ancram is not exhaustive and other significant species and habitats will probably be found with further investigation. Look for examples of calcareous wet meadow, fens, carbonate crest ledge and talus habitats, calcareous swamps (e.g., red-maple tamarack swamp), limestone woodland, and calcareous talus slope woodland. The Biodiversity Assessment Manual for the Hudson River Estuary Corridor (Kiviat and Stevens 2001) describes some of these habitats and provides a list of calcium-loving plants in Appendix 5."}, {"section_title": "Taconic Ridge", "text": "The Taconic Ridge runs along New York's border with Massachusetts in Rensselaer and Columbia Counties (Figure 1). This regionally significant landscape is identified as a significant biodiversity area by the NYSDEC Hudson River Estuary Program for its large forests and associated wildlife (Penhollow et al., 2006): \"The Taconic Ridge encompasses large areas of contiguous, high quality, northern hardwood forest underlain by complex metamorphic bedrock. It serves as a principle watershed and recharge area for numerous rich fens and associated rare plant and animal species. The Taconic Ridge extends nearly 60 miles along the eastern edge of New York State, [along Rensselaer, Columbia, and Dutchess Counties] and is about 12 miles wide at its widest point.\" The portion of the Taconic Ridge in Ancram is within Taconic State Park ( Figure 2). Four high quality forest types are found here: hemlock-northern hardwood forest, maple-basswood mesic forest, Appalachian oak hickory forest, and chestnut-oak forest. Timber rattlesnakes (state-threatened) and several rare plants are known from the Ridge as well. The complete list of rare species and significant ecosystems known from this area in Ancram is shown in Table 1. . The USGS stream data may be inaccurate or incomplete and will not show many of the intermittent streams in the town. The stream habitat information was determined based on the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation water quality classifications. Streams known to have trout (T) or trout spawning (TS) were identified as coldwater habitats. Streams without that designation are identified as warmwater habitats. These data show that there are only warmwater streams known in the Town of Ancram. Keep in mind these are generalized stream habitat types, and they do not reflect site-specific habitat quality."}, {"section_title": "Other Habitats", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Streams", "text": "The Farmscape Ecology Program at Hawthorne Valley Farm has shown that floodplain forests are home to a unique suite of plants and animals that tolerate occasional flooding (Knab-Vispo and Vispo 2010). Floodplain forests in Ancram tend to be characterized by a canopy of silver maple and green ash. Uncommon plants found in these forests included the regionally-rare green dragon. . Of particular ecological interest are \"ancient\" floodplain forests, which have been forested at least since the 1940s, and likely much longer. Forests that have not been completely cleared during that period, although they might have been used as woodlots for selective timber harvest, have significantly less invasive shrubs and more native forest herbs than recently reforested floodplains. Figure 3 shows the distribution of ancient, as well as reforested floodplains in Ancram. Most of the forested floodplain in Ancram is a mosaic of ancient and recently reforested patches along the Roeliff Jansen Kill."}, {"section_title": "Forests", "text": "The ability of forests to provide wildlife habitat, clean water, and economically viable forest products depends in part on our ability to maintain sizeable tracts of forest. The Large Forests map ( Figure 4) shows forests 200 acres and larger in Ancram. The map was created from land cover data developed for the Coastal Change Analysis Program (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 2006). Land cover categories considered 'forest' for this analysis include deciduous forest, evergreen forest, mixed forest, and palustrine forested wetland. Roads were removed from the map to identify unfragmented forest patches. Interstate roads were buffered by a total of 300 feet, state and county roads by 66 feet. Forest patch size classifications follow the Orange County Open Space Plan (Orange County Planning Department 2004) and cited in Strong (2008). In general, larger forests will provide more ecosystem services and higher quality forest habitat than smaller ones. However, keep in mind that the value of each forest is relative to the values of other forests in your community, watershed, or natural landscape. Even small patches of forest can be extremely valuable, depending on their landscape context. For example, the series of forest patches along a stream (e.g, those shown in Figure  3, rather than Figure 4) can create a riparian corridor that help maintain water quality, provide wildlife habitat, and serve as a travel route for forest plants and animals. Similarly, wooded hedgerows in an agricultural matrix often provide valuable breeding habitat, food sources, and travel routes for animals that would not otherwise use the agricultural landscape. Ancram's forest is fragmented, although there are several large forests. The largest forest is on the Taconic Ridge, of which only a small portion of which is in Ancram. It is more than 40,000 acres as it extends north, south, and east into neighboring municipalities (and Massachusetts). The largest forest located entirely within the town is just west of Route 22. It is more than 4,500 contiguous acres, and includes the Round Ball Public Conservation Area owned by the Columbia Land Conservancy and Fox Hill. Another large forests is shared with Copake, Gallatin, and Taghkanic (7500 acres). Overall, we know very little about the habitat quality of most forests in Ancram. However, the fact that records from the Breeding Bird Atlas show three blocks with Worm-eating warbler (two confirmed breeding records, one probable) is one clue that these forests do provide high quality habitat. This bird is considered area-sensitive and requires at least 700 acres of continuous forest to breed most successfully. The botanical composition of these forests depends largely on the underlying soils/bedrock and their management history. Forests that have re-grown on former agricultural fields tend to have more invasive plants and are less likely to provide good habitat for rare or uncommon native plants. Parts of Fox Hill and Round Ball have been forested since at least 1940, and were probably not completely cleared for agriculture. Round Ball harbors some regional rarities, such as leatherwood, mayapple, and the native bush honeysuckle. This public conservation area is a wonderful showcase for the patchwork of soil conditions which is to be expected in the forests of Ancram. Within a predominantly acidic matrix there are pockets of calcium-rich areas that support their own unique set of plants. Fox Hill has historic records of rocky summit indicators, the regionally-rare dwarf chestnut oak and smallflower bittercress (McVaugh 1957), but it is not known if they are still present."}, {"section_title": "Wetlands", "text": "Wetlands not only provide quality habitat for unique plants and animals, but provide important services for human communities, including pollutant removal, flood storage, and carbon sequestration. The Wetlands map ( Figure 5) shows wetlands as mapped by the US Fish and Wildlife Service for the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) as well as some information on potential wetlands based on county soil maps. \"Probable wetlands\" are those classified in the soil survey as very poorly drained or poorly drained, and \"possible wetlands\" are those classified as somewhat poorly drained soils (after Kiviat and Stevens 2001). The National Wetland Inventory data are available for you to view at the US Fish and Wildlife Service website. You will note that the probable and potential wetlands cover a greater area than the NWI wetland layer. NWI maps are known to be inaccurate, generally underestimating wetland area both because on-the-ground wetlands are larger than those shown on the map and because smaller and drier wetlands tend to be missed (Zucker and Lau, unpublished report). Nothing can replace the on-the-ground delineation for understanding wetlands. NYSDEC Freshwater wetlands (12.4 acres and larger) were purposefully not identified on the map. If you want more information on these wetlands, please contact the DEC Region 4 office. Though we have a good sense of where wetlands might be, we do not know which of these are most important for wildlife. The most recent NYS Breeding Bird Atlas has a probable breeding record for the NYS threatened species, Least Bittern, which depends on large wetlands with dense vegetation. The bird was found somewhere within the block shown on Figure 5. One high quality vernal pool that has been documented at Chaseholm Farm in the south-western part of the town, and records of spotted salamander in the NY Amphibian and Reptile Atlas reveal there are probably more of them. Vernal pools are small wetlands in forests (forested vernal pools are often called woodland pools) that hold water for only part of the year, when they serve as important breeding habitat for a group of forest salamanders. They are usually isolated from surface water flows and unprotected by state or federal programs, however, local governments can fill the gap. Consider identifying these features in a town natural resource inventory or during environmental review. To learn more about vernal pool conservation, visit the woodland pool conservation page on the NYSDEC website."}, {"section_title": "Shrubland (not mapped)", "text": "The presence of shrubland-dependent birds and New England Cottontail indicate that Ancram has important shrubland habitat. In eastern Ancram, there are two records of the New England Cottontail, which is a candidate for listing under the federal Endangered Species Act and a NYS Species of Special Concern. New England Cottontails live in young, shrubby forest and look similar to the common Eastern cottontail. Another indication of important shrubland is that seven shrubland bird species of conservation concern were found in the Breeding Bird Atlas blocks in the town (Table 2)."}, {"section_title": "Grasslands (not mapped)", "text": "We know that grassland, or meadow habitat, is also significant in town from several sources: the Farmscape Ecology Program, the Ancram habitat map, and the NYS Breeding Bird Atlas. Table 2 shows six grassland bird species of conservation concern in the state that are known to breed in Ancram. This is not uncommon for a Hudson Valley town with active farmland. Grassland breeding birds respond to vegetation structure rather than the mix of grass species, so hayfields dominated by non-native plants can provide suitable habitat for species of conservation concern as long as they are managed appropriately. Last year, Farmscape Ecology Program biologists documented a little bluestem meadow in the south-west corner of the Town of Ancram. Little bluestem tends to occur in meadows on shallow soils, usually on hillsides (and is sometimes accompanied by other unusual plants). The biologists found the regionally-rare cobweb skipper and county-rare Indian skipper. Both are native grassland butterflies whose caterpillars feed only on little bluestem."}, {"section_title": "Historic Records", "text": "Historic records are reports of species of state-wide conservation concern that were present in the past, but haven't been found at the respective locations in recent years. It is useful to be aware of these lost populations, because they make efforts to safeguard extant species of conservation concern all the more important. the sites are already known to be lost to the town. The NY endangered awned sedge (1936) was found in a pond south of Miller Pond. The handsome sedge (state threatened) was found near the Ancram Lead Mine, now Ancramdale. And an Indiana bat (federally endangered) hibernaculum was known from a limestone cave near the border with the Town of Northeast (1939). Approximately 50 additional plant species of now regional or County-wide conservation concern had been documented by McVaugh in Ancram in the 1930s, mostly in the calcium-rich wetlands and in the Taconics. That list can be requested from FEP, who is continuing inventories to determine which of these species are still present in the town."}, {"section_title": "Habitat Mapping by Ancram residents", "text": "Representatives from the Town of Ancram took Biodiversity Assessment Training in 2001-2002.
