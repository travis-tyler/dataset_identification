[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "According to the World Health Organisation (2001), mental illness affects one in four people among western countries. One of the most common mental disorders is depression. About 4.3% of the European population suffers from depressive disorders (WHO, 2020). Depression limits the ability of individuals to handle daily life's tasks including going to work. This disability produces high costs for the society (Trautmann et al., 2016) consisting of the direct costs such as psychological treatments, which are way lower than the indirect costs, associated with income losses due to work absence or early retirement (Bloom et al., 2011). This underlines the importance to ensure access to mental healthcare services and thereby fast psychological treatment and support. However, former research in rural and remote areas demonstrated that increasing availability and accessibility of mental health services is not sufficient in ensuring that people seek help for depressive symptoms (Jackson et al., 2007). Accordingly, socio-psychological factors need to be considered to understand help-seeking behavior for mental health issues."}, {"section_title": "Seeking help for mental problems", "text": "There are two types of help-seeking behaviors: Formal help-seeking encompasses receiving assistance from a licensed health professional such as a psychotherapist, and informal help-seeking, which is receiving assistance from the personal social environment such as family and friends (Rickwood & Thomas, 2012). Corresponding to informal helpseeking, searching for advice for emotional problems from clergy is also common (Sorgaard et al., 1996). Moreover, nowadays, the internet provides opportunities to seek help including formal and informal online support, and self-help options (Moock, 2014). Seeking formal help online from health care professionals as well as informal help in form of forums and social media can offer support for psychological problems (Collin et al., 2011). Further, it has been demonstrated that online cognitive behavioral therapy can lead to a reduction in symptoms for several psychological disorders, like anxiety disorders and major depression (Hoseini & Zare, 2020). Online support offers several advantages over face-toface support like increased anonymity and privacy (Gemert-Pijnen et al., 2018). Moreover, online support increases the accessibility to help, especially for rural population living in great distance to mental healthcare services. Although via the internet, psychological help is accessible for a large range of people, Boyd et al. (2007) demonstrated that the rural value system can still hinder help-seeking behavior. They identified the beliefs that mental health issues are a sign of weakness and individuals should be self-reliant in solving their problems, which interfere with formal help-5 seeking behavior. Furthermore, former research found that inhabitants of rural areas tend to regard themselves as responsible for their mental health and are thus less likely to seek formal help than their urban counterparts (Fuller et al., 2000;Judd et al, 2006). Further, rural population tend to prefer informal help among family and friends over mental healthcare services (Judd et al., 2006). Accordingly, the endorsement of different values and norms between rural and urban areas appear to lead to differences in help-seeking behavior for mental problems. It has to be noted that rurality varies greatly across countries: Large countries such as Australia, Canada or the United States are largely characterized by vast geographical distances and low population density (Australia: 3 inhabitants per km 2 ; Canada: 4 inhabitants per km 2 ; United States: 35 inhabitants per km 2 ) (Rechel et al., 2016). In comparison, most European countries exhibit significant higher population densities such as the Netherlands with 497 inhabitants per km 2 or Germany with 229 inhabitants per km 2 (Rechel et al., 2016). It is therefore important that these differences in social proximity are considered when discussing rurality and its implications for help-seeking behavior."}, {"section_title": "Social differences between rural and urban areas", "text": "Several studies focused on differences in the social environment between rural and urban areas and the consequences for help-seeking behavior. An example is a study of Parr et al. (2004), who proposed the \"rural paradox of proximity and distance\". This paradox refers to rural community members as being physically distant but socially proximate, as they tend to be well-informed about other community members. The lower population density and higher social proximity encourage a stronger sense of belonging to the community . In urban communities, this relationship exists in the opposite direction, namely that community members are physically proximate but socially distant. Parr et al. (2004) argue that the social proximity of rural areas decreases privacy and increases gossiping networks, which has been demonstrated to act as a barrier for seeking help for depression in rural adolescents (Boyd et al., 2007). This is consistent with former research that found that treatment-seeking behavior in rural areas is associated with less anonymity (Judd et al., 2006), which might further increase gossiping and decrease the likelihood of seeking help. This lack of privacy and increased gossiping can lead to stigmatization of individuals with mental health issues and social exclusion (Parr et al., 2004). In addition, rural population tend to have lower mental health literacy than population in cities (Griffith et al., 2009). Mental health literacy encompasses knowledge about mental disorders and the \"ability to recognize, manage and prevent mental illness\" (Furnham & Swami, 2018, p. 1). Thus, individuals with increased mental health literacy are more likely to identify psychological problems in themselves and others (Handley et al., 2018), and more likely to be confident about where to seek help (David & Shann, 2012). Moreover, decreased mental health literacy has been demonstrated to increase stigmatization of individuals (Griffith et al., 2008) and might contribute to a higher stigma of mental illness among rural than among urban areas. The impact of stigmatization on help-seeking behavior is supported by Aisbett et al. (2007), who demonstrated that perceived stigma is one of the key barriers for seeking mental health care. Accordingly, the fear of stigmatization in rural areas might lead to lower treatment-seeking behavior for mental problems in rural than in urban areas."}, {"section_title": "The role of stigma for help-seeking behavior", "text": "The term stigma is a social construct that refers to discrimination, stereotyping or status loss as a result of non-conformity of an individual to cultural norms (Byrne, 2000). Further, Corrigan (2004) distinguishes between public stigma and self-stigma. Public or perceived stigma involves the whole community and can take the form of labelling an individual based on a deviant characteristic and hence stigmatize this person. Self-stigma or personal stigma can be defined as internalizing public stigma resulting in disapproval of the own behavior and beliefs, which can lead to decreased self-esteem and social isolation (Latalova et al., 2014). According to former research, self-stigma of seeking psychological help mediates the relationship between public stigma and help-seeking attitudes (Stewart et al., 2015;Vogel et al., 2007). Moreover, Stewart et al. (2015) propose that public stigma is mainly influenced by the social structure an individual is living in, whereby self-stigma is influenced by cultural norms and values. As differences in the social structure and norms among the rural and urban population have been indicated by former research (Boyd et al., 2007;Parr et al., 2004), examining public and self-stigma between different regions might be relevant to understand help-seeking behavior."}, {"section_title": "State of the art of research about stigma and help-seeking behavior among rural and urban areas", "text": "Since stigma seems to play a major role in determining treatment-seeking, it was in the focus of research over the last decades. However, studies comparing the role of mental health stigma between rural and urban population demonstrate inconsistent results. On the one hand, research suggests that public and personal mental health stigma are higher among rural than among urban population (Hammer et al., 2013;Hoyt et al., 1997;Stewart et al., 2015;Ta et al., 2016). Moreover, it was demonstrated that rural population is less likely to seek formal help from healthcare providers, but to prefer informal help (Fuller et al., 2000;Judd et al, 2006). On the other hand, some studies did not find differences in the perception of public and personal mental health stigma between different geographies (Dschaak & Juntunen, 2018), in the attitudes towards seeking help (Dschaak & Juntunen, 2018) and formal help-seeking behavior (Batterham et al., 2019). To explain these findings, Dschaak and Juntunen (2018) argue that former research on stigma in rural and urban population included different samples, which might account for the inconsistent results. Moreover, the studies were conducted in countries that differ greatly in population structure and density, which probably influences rural life (Stewart et al., 2015;Ta et al., 2016). Further, it is claimed that the differentiation between rural and urban population on a dichotomous, population-size basis is too simple (Stewart et al., 2015). The presented inconsistencies in the literature emphasize the importance to investigate differences in mental health stigma among rural and urban areas. To understand possible differences, exploring predictors of stigma between rural and urban areas is relevant. Furthermore, inconsistencies in results on formal and informal help-seeking behavior among rural and urban individuals were demonstrated, which emphasizes the importance to inspect differences among regions and between regions more thoroughly. Moreover, the importance to investigate countries with comparable social geography is underlined."}, {"section_title": "The aim of this literature review", "text": "Considering the aforementioned inconsistencies in the literature, this literature review aims to investigate the role of stigma and help-seeking behavior among rural and urban areas more thoroughly. Moreover, this literature review focuses on individuals with depressive symptoms because depressive disorders are among the most common mental disorders in the western population (WHO, 2020). Additionally, by focusing on symptoms of one disorder it is aimed to increase the comparability of results among the included articles. Therefore, the following research question was developed. Does the perception of mental health stigma and help-seeking behavior for depressive symptoms differ among individuals in urban and rural areas? For further differentiation, three sub-questions were developed: The first sub-question investigates differences in public and personal stigma: Are there differences in public stigma and self-stigma towards seeking help for depressive symptoms among individuals in urban and rural areas? Second, to investigate determinants that influence the perception of mental health stigma, which might account for possible differences between rural and urban individuals, the following sub-question is proposed: Which factors influence public stigma and self-stigma among individuals with depressive symptoms in urban and rural areas? Third, inconsistencies in formal and informal help-seeking behavior among rural and urban population emphasize the importance of the further investigation, which is reflected in the third sub-question. Are there differences in formal and informal help-seeking behavior for depressive symptoms within and between the urban and rural population? Since no review on this topic has been published yet, this literature review can act as guidance for future investigations. Examining the role of mental health stigma more thoroughly is of importance as it interferes with the treatment of individuals with depression and other mental disorders. New insights might help design suitable interventions to target people with depression in different social contexts for increasing their use of mental health services."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Search strategy", "text": "This literature review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Moher et al., 2009).

The search was conducted in September 2020. To find all relevant studies, the main search terms \"depress*\", \"rural*\", \"urban*\", \"help-seeking\" and \"stigma*\" were combined in all possible combinations using the Boolean expression \"AND\" (Table 1).

First, studies found via the databases were screened for duplicates which were then removed. Next, titles and abstracts were screened for relevance. The remaining sources were investigated based on their eligibility for the current review by reading the full paper. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were used for the assessment of eligibility. The first inclusion criterion was that the study was published in/after the year 2000. This time frame was selected because of processes of re-urbanization of inner cities in western countries that started around the new millennium, changing social and economic structures in rural and urban areas (Europe: Buzar et al, 2006;U.S.: Fishman, 2005). Thus, the second criterion for inclusion is that the study was conducted with a sample from western culture. Other inclusion criteria were: 3) written in English, 4) conducted with rural and/or urban population, 5) including measures of depressive symptoms, 6) including the construct of stigma and/or help-seeking behavior. Next, a snowballing search was applied to increase the number of relevant studies. This strategy encompasses the search of literature through reference lists or citations of relevant papers (Wohlin, 2014). Figure 1 displays the selection process in a decision tree according to the PRISMA guidelines (Moher et al., 2009).

Six reviewed studies measured depressive symptoms in a non-clinical sample, three included a diagnostic interview to identify depression and three included participants with a former diagnosed depressive disorder. Moreover, most studies (n= 8) also included participants with other disorders. Most frequently included are participants with anxiety disorders (n=7). Furthermore, different living areas were included: Three studies included a dichotomous differentiation between urban and rural participants, two studies differentiated also between participants living in rural areas adjacent to metropolitan regions. Five studies examined only a rural sample, one only an urban sample and one study investigated participants from rural and mid-sized communities. Overall, the percentage of women among the participants was higher than men ranging between 49% to 79.6%. Two exceptional studies examined only one gender, once male and once female. The average age in the reviewed studies varied greatly between the mean age of 14.34 to 68.4 years because two studies examined adolescents and one focused on the elderly.  Note. GAD= Generalized anxiety disorder; PTSD= Post-traumatic stress disorder In the following, the relevant results to the three sub-questions are presented. Table 4 displays the measures and key results of the quantitative literature, whereas Table 5 provides an overview of the reviewed qualitative literature. Are there differences in public stigma and self-stigma towards seeking help for depressive symptoms among individuals in urban and rural areas? To answer the first sub-question, the results of five reviewed studies are considered  investigated public mental illness stigma in a sample of rural healthcare service users with low-income. Respondents describe a social environment that does not recognize mental illness as a serious health problem for which to seek help but as a condition that can be solved by pulling oneself together. Moreover, respondents report the stigmatized belief of their social environment that individuals act as if they had a mental disorder to avoid responsibility for their life. Furthermore, it is believed that God can heal mental disorders, and that mental issues can be the result of disloyalty towards God. As a result, respondents report experiencing fear and shame for seeking help for mental problems. Herron et al. (2020) ([9]) investigated with whom rural men talk about their mental problems. In line with former research, their interviews revealed that rural men experience a culture of gossiping, which hinders them to talk about their mental health problems because they fear to be stigmatized and judged negatively or as weak. The results of Townley et al. (2016) ([12]) demonstrate that individuals with a serious mental illness living in urban centers reported less public mental health stigma and a stronger sense of community than in rural areas. Moreover, their results revealed higher community participation and perceived neighborhood quality among the urban than the rural respondents, that possibly decreases the perception of public mental health stigma. However, their study investigated correlations rather than causality. Consequently, no conclusions of causality of social structure on health stigma can be drawn. Besides the social environment, Calear et al. (2010) ( [4]) identified demographic predictors for public and personal depression stigma among rural and urban adolescents. Among both living areas, they identified that higher public stigma was predicted by female gender, increased levels of anxiety, having parents with depression and personal depression stigma. Higher self-stigma of depression was predicted by male gender, being younger, having no personal history of depression, no parents with depression, and public depression stigma. Thus, no significant differences in demographic predictors of stigma were found between rural and urban population. In addition, Simmons et al (2015) ([11]) found that rural women with low self-stigma and high public stigma were younger, and had higher education levels. Moreover, these women were most likely to seek help in case of need. Consistent with these findings, they reported that older women with lower education levels perceived higher self-and lower public stigma."}, {"section_title": "Are there differences in formal and informal help-seeking behavior for depressive symptoms within and between the rural and urban population?", "text": "To answer this sub-question, the results of seven reviewed studies are considered ( The lack of formal mental help-seeking behavior in the rural population was also investigated by Elliott and Larson (2004) ([7]). They examined health care service use in adolescents living in rural and mid-sized communities in the US and found that almost half of the participants reported not seeking professional help although they felt a need for it. Second, formal and informal help-seeking behavior and sources of informal helpseeking behavior in the urban population was investigated by Brown et al. (2014) ([3]). They found that the majority of urban population with depressive symptoms sought both, formal and informal help. Most common sources of informal help encompassed friends and family. Only little participants sought informal help from a religious leader. Two included studies directly compare help-seeking behavior in different living areas Green et al. (2012) ([8]). investigated the delay in treatment-seeking for anxiety and depressive disorders among the rural and regional population in Australia. Their results revealed that respondents from remote or very remote areas are about 19 times more likely to delay formal treatment seeking for depression by more than one year compared to regional areas. These results are partly contradicting with the study result from Batterham et al. (2019) ( [1]). They found no differences in formal help-seeking behavior from a general practitioner, social worker, hospital, psychiatrist, and general counselling between the rural and urban population. However, they found that psychologists were consulted 26% less often in rural than in urban areas.  There were no significant differences in stigma between different living areas. [2] Brenes et al.  Experienced fear and shame with regards to seeking mental health: Fear to be judged negatively and be perceived as weak.

As an orientation, the estimated average of residents per square kilometer in the mentioned states or countries were added for orientation by the author of this literature review (Table 6). Rural-Urban Classification systems. In the following, the three included classification systems are shortly introduced: According to the ASGC Remoteness classification for Australia, remote areas are characterized by limited accessibility of services, goods and opportunities for social interaction (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Canberra, 2004). The difference between very remote areas is that this accessibility is even more limited in very remote areas than in remote ones. Thus, based on these accessibilities, an index score from 0 (high accessibility) to 15 (very restricted accessibility) is calculated. Contrary to the Australian remoteness classification system, the American Urban Influence Code (UIC) classifies rural and remote areas according to their population size and their adjacency to the metro or micro areas (Economic Research Service, 2019). Thus, counties or cities are classified among 12 levels ranging from 1 (large metro area of over 1 million inhabitants) to 12 (Noncore not adjacent to metro or micro area, not containing a town of at least 2500 inhabitants). Similar to the UIC, the USDA Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC) distinguishes nonmetropolitan counties by their adjacency to metro areas and also according to their urbanization (Economic Research Service, 2019). This classification system consists of three metropolitan categories from 1 (Counties in metro areas of one million inhabitants or more) to 3 and six nonmetropolitan categories from 4 to 9 (Rural or less than 2500 urban inhabitants, non-adjacent to the metro area). To sum up, the Australian system considers the accessibility of goods and services to assess rurality, whereas the American classification systems evaluate the adjacency to metro areas and population size. However, the American systems differ in their classification categories for identifying urbanity and rurality. Next, the county of residence was classified with the Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC), for classifying urban and rural counties. Townley et al. (2016) ([12]) reported a higher sense of community among urban than among rural participants, which was contradicting with former research. Considering the high degree of remoteness and thus probable large distance to others might help understand these findings. Overall, it can be stated that only a few studies reported a detailed description of the living area of participants and classified it according to a rurality classification system. This lack of reporting impedes further detailed comparison. Additionally, the comparison is hindered by differences of measures between the classification systems. The implications of these findings are discussed in the following."}, {"section_title": "Table 6", "text": "Information on the location provided in the reviewed studies  results concerning the perception of mental health stigma between rural and areas. Public and personal stigma was predicted by demographic variables that did not differ between rural and urban areas. Moreover, the social environment seems to negatively influence public stigma in rural areas. Lastly, formal and informal help-seeking between rural and urban population differed in that rural population tend to prefer informal help, whereas urban population tend to prefer a combination of formal and informal help for mental problems. To explain these findings in detail, the results on the three sub-questions are discussed."}, {"section_title": "Are there differences in public stigma and self-stigma towards seeking help for depressive symptoms among individuals in urban and rural areas?", "text": "Inconsistencies in the perception of public stigma and self-stigma among the rural and urban population were found in the reviewed literature. Accordingly, no clear conclusions can be drawn concerning differences in the perception of the stigma of help-seeking behavior for depressive symptoms among different geographies. The inconsistencies in the perception of public and personal stigma among rural and urban areas are most likely to be explained by the different measures used for mental health stigma. The included measures of stigma encompassed stigma of psychological help-seeking behavior ([10]), depression stigma ( [4], [11]) and mental health stigma in general ([12]). As different aspects of stigma were measured, this might impact the comparability. Furthermore, different samples were examined, namely adolescents ( [4]) and adults ([10], [11], |12]). As younger participants seem to perceive higher stigma ( [4]), this factor is important to consider. Lastly, participants differed in terms of how rural they lived, varying from approximately 1.8 inhabitants per km 2 ([10]) to approximately 39 inhabitants per km 2 ([11]), which probably also impacts the development and perception of stigma. A last possible explanation might be that the perception of public and self-stigma towards seeking psychological help for depressive symptoms between rural and urban areas is not as different as former research suggested. Thus, other factors than the living area might be more determining for the development of public and self-stigma."}, {"section_title": "Which factors influence public stigma and self-stigma among individuals with depressive symptoms in urban and rural areas?", "text": "Main findings demonstrate that among rural and urban areas, higher public stigma in individuals with depressive symptoms is predicted by being female ( [4]), being younger ([11]), having an own history of depression ([4]), increased educational level ( [4]), and by a non-supportive social environment ([5], [9], [12]). The increased perception of public stigma in women might be explained by increased awareness and knowledge about the disorder (Griffith et al., 2008;Jorm & Wright, 2009), caused by a higher prevalence of depressive disorders among women than among men (Abate, 2013). Moreover, higher self-stigma was found among young men without a personal history of depressive symptoms ( [4]). The higher perceived personal stigma among young men might be explained by men being less tolerant towards symptoms of depression due to no or little personal experience with it (Sheffield et al., 2004). Having no personal experience with depression and thus decreased depression literacy was identified as a predictor for higher personal stigma by former research (Griffith et al., 2008). In addition, the importance of the social environment on influencing public stigma was former research finding that higher levels of social support are associated with lower levels of public stigma (Hoyt et al. 1997). Not recognizing mental illness or regarding mental illness as a punishment from God both indicate little familiarity and knowledge about depression. This is in line with former research demonstrating that rural population tend to have lower mental health literacy than population in cities (Griffith et al., 2009).This lack of depression literacy in rural areas is likely to increase further prejudices towards mentally ill (Corrigan et al., 2001), which might lead to increased gossiping and thus stigmatization. Overall, no differences in demographic predictors for public and self-stigma between rural and urban population could be found. However, the depression literacy of the social environment seems to be important for perceived stigma, especially among rural areas. Accordingly, demographic variables and mental health literacy seem to be determining for public and self-stigma."}, {"section_title": "Are there differences in formal and informal help-seeking behavior for depressive symptoms within and between the urban and rural population?", "text": "Comparison of the reviewed literature revealed that rural and remote population tend to prefer informal help-seeking from partners ([9]), friends ([9]) and clergy ([5]), and tend to delay formal help-seeking ([8]). Urban population tend to prefer a combination of seeking formal help from health care providers and informal help from friends and family ([3]). Furthermore, no differences in intentions to seek formal help online could be found between rural and urban population ([9]). An explanation for differences in formal help-seeking behavior among rural and urban individuals might be the endorsement of different values and norms. Examples reported by rural respondents are the importance of self-reliance (Boyd et al., 2007), regarding mental disorders as weakness and being responsible for one's psychological health (Judd et al, 2006). Another aspect that is hindering help-seeking from psychological services in rural areas is that respondents questioned the helpfulness of mental healthcare services [2] [6]. As indicated by former research, believing in the helpfulness of a healthcare provider predicts its use (Komiti et al., 2006) and is thus important to consider for future interventions. Furthermore, the clergy was identified as an important source of informal help among the rural, but not among the urban population. Prior research indicates that rural population in the US tend to be more religious than the urban population (Braun & Maghri, 2004) and tend to seek psychological help from clergy (Wang et al., 2003). Weaver et al. (2019) found that depressive individuals from rural regions were receptive for church-based mental health interventions, which might be an effective way to increase help-seeking in rural and remote areas. Further, online-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) is another possibility of treatment seeking among rural and urban population. In addition to the findings of this review ([10]), former research suggested that rurality does not negatively affect the uptake of or adherence to online-based cognitive therapy for depressive disorders (Vallury et al., 2015). Thus, online therapy might offer new possibilities to ensure access to mental healthcare by overcoming barriers in rural and remote areas."}, {"section_title": "Strengths and Limitations", "text": "This literature review is the first review on differences in the urban and rural population with regards to mental health stigma and help-seeking behavior for depressive symptoms. As depressive disorder are increasingly common (WHO, 2020), it is of importance to understand how individuals with depressive symptoms seek help and what might hinder them from seeking help. Other strengths of the thesis are 1) three online databases were extensively searched to find all relevant sources and 2), this review was administered according to the PRISMA guidelines for literature reviews (Moher et al., 2009), which ensures transparency of the research process. Still, there are some limitations to consider when interpreting the results of this review. A first limitation is that studies differed in stigma measures including assessment for depression stigma, the stigma of help-seeking behavior and mental health stigma in general which might hinder comparability. Still, studies were included as literature on stigma perceived by individuals with depressive symptoms in rural and urban areas is limited and as studies fulfilled inclusion criteria. Also contributing to the difficulty of comparing studies is the reporting of the living area. Most studies did not include a detailed assessment of the living area of participants but only included the differentiation between rural and urban. However, this dichotomous differentiation might be too broad to represent nuanced differences between living areas. Moreover, in most studies, no specific place of residence was provided, which limits the possibility of a detailed comparison between sources. Another limitation of the current review is that the included studies investigating rurality were conducted in the USA, Canada and Australia and thus only include some of the largest western countries. Due to a large size and thus greater distances between residential areas, rurality in these three countries might not be comparable to rurality in other western countries such as European states. Consequently, the results of this review might not be generalizable to smaller countries. Another aspect that might affect the quality of the review is that the quality of most included studies was assessed as moderate, which means that one component of an included study was assessed as weak in quality. Reasons for a weak assessment were, for example, non-verified measurement instruments, a non-representative sample or little response rates. Further, the quality was assessed only by the author of the review. Thus, subjectivity among the assessment cannot be ruled out."}, {"section_title": "Practical implications and future research", "text": "Despite these limitations, this literature review is the first to compare rural and urban areas concerning mental health stigma and help-seeking behavior for depressive symptoms. The results of this literature review demonstrate that future stigma-prevention interventions should target adolescents, as they are most likely to perceive public and self-stigma ( [4]). Targeting public stigma of mental disorders is of importance and should continue to be the focus of global campaigns. However, public stigma is difficult to change, which is why more practical implications could be to target self-stigma among adolescents, and especially among men. As decreased mental health literacy seem to promote self-stigma of depression (Griffith et al., 2008), future interventions should focus on changing attitudes by increasing knowledge about mental illnesses and its treatment possibilities in both, rural and urban areas. Investigations on anti-stigma campaigns revealed that negative attitudes of adolescents towards mental disorders could be changed with education (Corrigan et al., 2012). Thus, incorporating education about mental illnesses and their treatment possibilities into school's curriculum might be beneficial. Further, results of this literature review revealed that rural adults tend to question the helpfulness of mental health care services ([2], [6]). Thus, also for adults, it is important to further enhance the knowledge about psychological treatment and its effectiveness for mental illness, especially in rural areas. Further, based on the results of this literature review, directions for future research can be derived. First, future research could investigate and clarify the importance of rurality and urbanity on public and personal stigma. As results of this review indicate that demographic variables and mental health literacy are most predictive of public and self-stigma, there is a need for further investigations. Second, this review underlines the importance of developing universal guidelines for classifying areas from urban to very remote. Making use of a classification system that is used universally would enable detailed comparison of different countries. Lastly, since this review focused on rural regions of large-sized western countries (Australia, USA, Canada), future research might execute similar comparison among smaller western states to examine possible differences."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This literature review sought to examine differences in stigma and help-seeking behavior among the rural and urban population with depressive symptoms in western countries. Results revealed no clear differences in the perception of public and self-stigma among rural and urban areas. Public stigma is highest among young, highly educated women, who have experienced depressive symptoms in themselves and who have a non-supportive social environment. Personal stigma is highest among young men with no own experiences regarding depressive symptoms and little mental health literacy. Furthermore, the reviewed literature revealed that the rural population is more likely to seek informal help, whereas the urban population tend to prefer a combination of formal and informal sources of help. To increase the comparability of results, future research should develop universal guidelines for classifying geographies."}]
