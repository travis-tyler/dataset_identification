[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused serious infections and deaths around the world, and it is becoming clearer that economic and social consequences are also devastating. Being faced with the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent sharp economic contraction, national governments have been trying to mitigate social and economic damages by introducing new emergency cash benefits and expanding existing social programs. Nonetheless, there are daily news reports of job loss, poverty, mental disorders, and even suicides that have been directly or indirectly induced by the COVID-19 economic crisis.\nJapan has also suffered from these economic and social difficulties despite its relative success in mitigating COVID-19 infection spread without imposing a strict lockdown policy. 1 As Figure 1 shows, in Japan, the COVID-19 employment shock emerges as sharp drops in the employment rate and labor force participation (LFP) rate since April 2020, while the indices of the unemployment rate and the jobs-toapplicants ratio (i.e., the ratio of job offers to job applicants) have also gradually deteriorated. Figure 1 also suggests that suicide rates have been increasing since July 2020. It is not clear from this graph to what degree the COVID-19 crisis has led to the increase in suicides, but some specialists and news media have reported that the sharp deterioration in employment in the first few months of the COVID-19 crisis may have resulted in the slightly lagged increase in suicides. 2 \".\nThis paper therefore provides an early-stage analysis on whether the COVID-19 employment shock affects suicide, using the latest monthly suicide data. We exploit regional (i.e. prefecture-level) variations in the magnitude of the COVID-19-induced employment deterioration and adopt a DID research design to mitigate the estimation bias arising from possible confounding factors.\nWe also investigate whether the employment shock has affected means-tested 1 As of November 2020, in Japan the infection and death rates of COVID-19 have been relatively low in comparison to other developed countries at least until. The cumulative numbers of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths per one million population on November 11th 2020 are about 871 and 15 respectively, compared with 18,911 and 453 in the EU countries and 30,990 and 724 in the U.S, according to the website Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus, accessed on 12th November 2020). In addition, Japan has not introduced a strict lockdown policy, and according to the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker Japan's government response stringency index has been the lowest among the G7 countries since April 2020, lower than that in South Korea since May 2020, and mostly lower than or roughly equal to that of Sweden since April 2020 (https://ourworldindata.org/policy-responses-covid, accessed on 12th November 2020).\n2 See, among others, articles in the Japan Times such as \"Suicide spike in Japan shows mental health toll of COVID-19\" (9th October 2020, https://www.japantimes.co.jp/ news/2020/10/09/national/social-issues/suicide-mental-health-coronavirus) and \"Japan suicides rise as economic impact of coronavirus hits home\" (11th November 2020, https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/11/11/national/ japan-suicide-rise-coronavirus). The number of accepted applications for programs Sources: Employment rate, labor force participation rates, and the unemployment rate are from the Labor Force Survey and the jobs-to-applicants ratio is from the General Employment Placement Status. Suicide rates are provided as police statistics and aggregated by the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare. The numbers of accepted applications for poverty-alleviation programs are provided by the central government. From April to September 2020, the monthly data aggregation is irregular as follows: April data is based on the numbers from 25th March to 2nd May, May data is from 3rd May to 30th May, June data is from 31st May to 27th June, and July data is from 28th June to 1st August.\npoverty alleviation programs such as a public assistance program, a temporary housing benefit program, and two emergency loan programs. Because an increase in the recipients and caseloads of means-tested programs can be seen as the signs of both economic distress and relief, it is hard to identify the mitigating effects of poverty alleviation programs on suicide. But some insights may nevertheless be obtained about the consequences of the COVID-19 employment shock and policy responses to them. The contributions of our paper are at least three-fold. First, we provide earlystage plausible evidence of the impact of the COVID-19-induced employment shock on suicide and means-tested poverty alleviation programs, which has rarely been studied so far. Second, from a more general viewpoint, our study contributes to the literature on the impact of the world-wide economic distress on suicide and public policies, exploiting plausibly exogenous change in employment environments. Third, because we investigate ongoing economic and social incidents under the COVID-19 pandemic using the latest monthly panel data, we also contribute to the emerging literature of economic and policy evaluation using real-time data (Chetty et al. 2020) .\nIn previous studies, employment shocks have been considered to be important determinants of suicide. While the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on socioeconomic and public-policy outcomes such as unemployment and unemployment insurance benefits have been studied (Adams-Prassl et al. 2020; Bitler et al. 2020) , little research has yet examined the impact of the COVID-19-induced employment shock on socio-economic outcomes such as suicide and poverty alleviation programs. 3 When looking at broader contexts before the COVID-19 crisis, the effect of recessions on mortality has been well studied and many studies have shown that increases in unemployment are associated with a rise in the suicide rate (Ruhm 2000; Chen et al. 2009; Ruhm 2015; Matsubayashi et al. 2020) . See also Arthi and Parman (2020) for a recent review of the possible long-run impacts of COVID-19 economic consequences on various socio-economic outcomes from a historical perspective.\nAnother related article suggests that counter-cyclical economic policies are effective for the prevention of suicide (Christian et al. 2019; Stuckler et al. 2009; Fishback et al. 2007 ). Although we examine poverty alleviation programs only as outcomes and do not investigate whether such programs have mitigated suicides, our study may also provide some insight on this research topic.\nThe rest of the paper consists of the following sections. Section 2 describes our research design and the data that we use for analysis. Section 3 explains our empirical model. In Section 4 we provide estimation results and in section 5 we provide additional estimation results using an alternative employment-shock variable. Section 6 concludes.\n3 Epidemiologists indicate that the rise in unemployment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to lead to an increase in the suicide rate (Kawohl and Nordt 2020; Gunnell et al. 2020) . So far, there are only a few studies that investigate suicide under the COVID-19 economic shocks. When it comes to suicide in Japan, Tanaka and Okamoto (2020) shows that the suicide rate declined after the COVID-19 crisis, comparing the citymonth-level suicide mortality rate in Japan before and after the COVID-19 crisis, Ueda et al. (2020) also found that the number of suicide deaths decreased from 2017-2019 to the early phase of the COVID crisis but increased from the June 2020. Isumi et al. (2020) shows that the suicide rate among children and adolescents did not increase during the school closure but increased in May. Using online survey data, Sueki and Ueda (2020) found suicidal ideation in April 2020 decreased compared with January 2020. They also found suicidal ideation levels among young and economically vulnerable people in Japan have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 crisis.\n2 Research design and data"}, {"section_title": "Research design", "text": "Exploiting the sudden and plausibly exogenous variation in the COVID-19 employment shock at the prefecture level, we adopt a difference-in-differences (DID) strategy to investigate the effect of the COVID-19 employment shock on suicides and poverty alleviation programs.\nMore concretely, we investigate how the regional variation in the COVID-19induced employment shock is correlated to the regional trends of suicides and povertyalleviation programs and examine to what extent we can interpret this correlation as the causal effect of the employment shock on the outcomes of interest.\nWe use prefecture-level monthly data from various data sources. Japanese prefectures, such as Tokyo, Kyoto, and Hokkaido, are comparable to states in the U.S. and provinces in Canada and some other European countries, and the total number of prefectures is 47. Prefectures are the second-tier local governments in Japan; the third-tier local governments are municipalities, the number of which is 1,724 (as of October 2020.)

That is, we define the COVID-19-induced employment shock as the following de-trended decrease in the employment rate from the first quarter (i.e. January to March) to the second quarter (i.e. April to June) in 2020 at the prefecture level:\nwhere i indicates prefecture, X is the employment rate, and 1Q and 2Q are the first and second quarters respectively. The first term in equation (1) is a change in the employment rate from the first quarter to the second quarter of 2020 which includes a COVID-19-induced employment shock and the second term is a counterpart change in 2019 which reflects a prefecture-specific seasonal trend from the first quarter to the second quarter. The difference between these two terms is thus expected to capture the COVID-19-induced employment shock and the negative of this change represents the magnitude of the \"decrease\" in the employment rate caused by the COVID-19 crisis. We interpret this COVID-19-induced decrease in the employment rate as the employment shock caused by the COVID-19 economic crisis."}, {"section_title": "5", "text": ".

For additional employment-shock variables, we also use prefecture-level variations in two employment indicators: the labor force participation (LFP) rate and the unemployment rate, which we will discuss further in Section 5.\nFinally, what we use is the prefecture-level estimates of the average employment rate, LFP rate, and unemployment rate provided in the Labour Force Survey. The prefecture-level estimates are estimated by the Statistics Bureau. The Bureau notes that some imprecision is expected for the estimates, but we treat the estimated values as true values and do not consider their statistical uncertainty in our statistical analysis due to data limitation."}, {"section_title": "Outcome variables", "text": "For outcome variables, we focus on suicide rates and four existing means-tested poverty alleviation programs. Here we briefly explain these variables. See Ando et al. (2020) for more details about Japan's fiscal measures against COVID-19, including the four poverty alleviation programs, in the first six months of the COVID-19 crisis.\nSuicide rates Our primary outcome of interest is the suicide rate, which is the number of suicides per one hundred thousand population age 15 and over. We investigate the monthly panel data of three suicide-rate variables: total suicide rate, female suicide rate, and male suicide rate. We use the prefecture-level data between January 2019 and September 2020 and the number of suicides is aggregated based on the dates and places of suicide. 4 For our DID analysis, we use both the suicide rate and the year-on-year suicide rate. The year-on-year suicide rate at month t is calculated as a difference between the suicide rate at month t and the one-year-lag suicide rates at month t \u2212 12. This procedure is meant to control for monthly fixed effects.\nPublic Assistance The first variable of a poverty alleviation program is the percapita number of Public Assistance recipients. For this variable, we use both the original per-capita number of recipients and the counterpart year-on-year value as we do for the suicide rates.

This benefit scheme, originally only for those who have lost their jobs, was rarely used before the COVID crisis as shown in Figure 1 . But since April 2020, its eligibility has been extended to those who have not lost their jobs but have still experienced a large income reduction, resulting in a considerable increase in the number of households receiving the benefits. Because of the limited data availability, we can use only January, February, and March 2019 in the pre-COVID-19 period and April, May, and June 2020 in the post-COVID-19 period.\nTemporary loan programs The third and fourth variables of the poverty-alleviation programs are the numbers of accepted applications per one hundred thousand population for two types of interest-free and guarantor-free emergency temporary loan programs: Emergency Small Amount Funds for those who urgently need cash and General Support Funds for those who need cash for a certain period. They are both existing means-tested emergency loan programs, but they were also rarely utilized before the COVID-19 crisis (see Figure 1 ). However, their requirements have also been relaxed since March 2020 and the number of loan recipients has increased dramatically. We use the monthly data between January 2019 and July 2020, but due to the limited data availability, we do not have the data for February and March 2020. 5 In addition, the monthly-level data aggregation from April to July 2020 is slightly irregular, although it should not cause serious estimation bias. 6 Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of our treatment and outcome variables. Because we use the panel data of 47 prefectures from January 2019 to September 2020 (21 months), the full sample size is 987. Because the employment-shock variables defined in equation (1) are time-invariant and cross-sectional variables, we have 47 observations. The variables of suicide rates are 21-months data while the variables of public assistance recipients lack the data for September 2020. The variables of 5 Statistics in February and March 2020 were missing from the original data provided by the government. 6 The number of loan decisions between April and July 2020 in the statistics provided by the central government is aggregated as follows: April data is based on the numbers from 25th March to 2nd May, May data is from 3rd May to 30th May, June data is from 31st May to 27th June, and July data is 28th June to 1st August."}, {"section_title": "7", "text": ".

The Y axis in the left panels is a change in the suicide rate (from January to September 2020) and a change in the number of Public Assistance recipients per one hundred thousand people (from January to August in 2020). For the Y axis in the right graphs, a counterpart outcome change in 2019 is further subtracted from the original outcome change. The size of each circle is based on the population size of each prefecture.

The coefficients of interest are the time-varying coefficients \u03b2 \u03c4 , which capture the correlation between EmpShock i and the outcome trend from January 2020 to time \u03c4 . When time \u03c4 is before January 2020, \u03b2 \u03c4 can be interpreted as a placebo estimate that is expected to be zero if no confounding trends exist before the COVID-19 crisis. When month \u03c4 is after January 2020, \u03b2 \u03c4 can be seen as the average impact of EmpShock i given that the placebo estimates are around zero and the assumption of no differential trends in the COVID-19 period is plausible.\nIn the regression analysis, we use both the ordinary least square (OLS) estimation method and the weighted least square (WLS) estimation method in which prefecturelevel population sizes are used as weights. With this WLS model, the heterogeneous effect of the employment shock on an outcome for a larger prefecture is more highly weighted in a DID estimator. We use both estimation methods because, as Solon et al. (2015) point out, it is not straightforward whether a WLS estimator is more appropriate than an OLS estimator as an estimator of a population average effect when effect heterogeneity exists.\nFurthermore, we also provide estimation results with prefecture-level linear trends 9 .

Controlling for the prefecture-level linear trends may reduce the bias from confounding differential trends. Figure 3 shows the estimation results for the suicide rates based on four different model specifications. First, DID estimates in the pre-COVID-19 period are more or less zero, implying that there is no clear statistically significant correlation between the employment shock and all the outcome trends before January 2020. While some fluctuations in the pre-COVID-19 estimates suggest that there may be some idiosyncratic monthly correlations that exist between the shock and the outcome trends before the COVID-19 period, they should not be sources of confounding trends in the post-COVID-19 estimates."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "When it comes to the post-COVID-19 estimates after January 2020, the estimates for total and male suicide rates are consistently positive from May onward regardless of model specifications and outcome specifications and the lower bounds of the 90% confidence intervals are often above or near zero. In particular, the estimates for male suicide rate are robustly above zero from May 2020. The sizes of the estimates differ between OLS and WLS: the OLS estimates for the male suicide rate in June, the last month of the second quarter, suggest that the one-percentagepoint reduction in the employment rate led to around a 0.25-0.44 point increase in the suicide rate whereas the counterpart WLS estimates indicate around a 0.14-0.18 point increase.\nOn the other hand, we do not find noticeable changes in DID estimates for the female suicide rate in the COVID-19 period. Although the estimate is significantly different from zero in May 2020 when the simple, not year-on-year, female suicide rate is used as an outcome, the other post-COVID-19 estimates for the female suicide rate are mostly not significantly different from zero.\nOverall, the DID estimates suggest that the negative employment shock caused by the COVID-19 economic crisis has led to the increase in male suicides. However, we cannot find robust evidence of a similar effect for female suicides.\nThe magnitude of the estimated impact is not small. The minimum estimate for the year-on-year male suicide rate in June 2020 is 0.14 and the maximum is 0.44. Because the average monthly male suicide rate (i.e. the average number of suicides per one hundred thousand population in a month) during the sample period is 1.85, the increase by 0.14-0.44 is not negligible; as of October 2020 the male population in Japan is about 61,260,000, so a back-of-the-envelope calculation based on the estimates suggests that the one-percentage point decrease in the employment rate under the COVID-19 crisis has led to an additional 86-270 male suicides per 10 .

First, we observe similar positive post-COVID-19 estimates for Public Assistance recipients to the baseline estimates with the employment-rate shock when the year-on-year variable is used (the upper right graph), while results are noisier when the simple, not year-on-year, outcome is used (the upper left graph). In particular, when the prefecture linear trends are incorporated in the model for the year-on-year outcome, the estimates clearly suggest that the increase in the unemployment rate has resulted in the increase in the number of Public Assistance recipients.\nThe lower three graphs of Figure 7 provide counterpart DID estimations for the outcomes of the other poverty alleviation programs. Interestingly, there seem to be some positive correlations between the COVID-19-induced unemployment increase and the utilization of all of these programs, although the confidence intervals tend to be relatively large. We speculate that these positive correlations, which are not precisely observed when we use the employment-rate shock as the treatment variable, can be explained by the fact that these poverty alleviation programs are primarily for those who have lost their income by losing or stopping their jobs and need urgent financial support. The increase in the unemployed population, rather than the decrease in the labor force, should be more strongly related to the increasing caseloads of these poverty alleviation programs.

Figure 4 provides estimation results for the means-tested poverty alleviation programs. To begin with, DID estimates for the number of Public Assistance recipients (the upper two figures) are significantly different from zero and increasing in the COVID-19 period (i.e. after January 2019). While the non-zero estimates in the pre-COVID-19 period based on the models without prefecture linear trends suggest there exist some differential trends that are correlated with the employment shock, the introduction of prefecture linear trends successfully mitigates such confounding trends and suggests that the employment shock has caused the increase in Public Assistance recipients.\nThe DID estimates in August 2020 are around 5.3 and 7.9 according to the OLS and WLS estimation methods with prefecture linear trends respectively. This implies that the one-percentage point decrease in the employment rate resulted in about 5 to 8 Public Assistance recipients per one hundred thousand population. Because the average number of Public Assistance recipients in the sample period is about 1,400 people per one hundred thousand population (Table 1) , the margin of 5 to 8 can be considered relatively small.\nEstimates for the other three poverty alleviation programs are mostly not significantly different from zero (the lower three figures), but the estimates are increasing and sometimes significantly different from zero, suggesting the possibility of some positive effects on these programs. Note that the numbers of accepted applications for these programs are discontinuously smaller before the COVID-19 crisis than after the crisis, the estimates before the COVID-19 period are negligible and we cannot access the pre-COVID-19 trends in these outcomes.\nThe results suggest that, if the causal interpretation of the DID estimates is plausible, the one-percentage-point increase in the employment rate leads to around 19-33 accepted applications per one hundred thousand population for Emergency Small Amount Funds in June 2020 and roughly 14-26 accepted applications per one hundred thousand population for General Support Funds in July 2020. 7 These numbers are much higher than the estimated marginal increase in Public Assistance recipients.\nTo sum, the estimation results show the COVID-19-induced employment shock measured by the decrease in the employment rate has had a clear but small impact on the increase in the number of Public Assistance recipients. The estimates for the other three programs are not precise, but the results suggest that the magnitude of the impact on the utilization of the temporary loan programs may be larger than that on Public Assistance. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint\nThe copyright holder for this this version posted November 18, 2020. ; https://doi.org/10.1101 doi: medRxiv preprint The treatment variable is the COVID-19-induced employment shock, which is calculated as a decrease in the prefecture-level employment rate from the second quarter of 2019 to the second quarter of 2020.

It implies that the COVID-19 employment shock examined in the baseline analysis can be interpreted as the impact of the reduction in the labor force.

Estimation \"with trends\" for the outcome of Public Assistance incorporates prefecture-level (i.e. individual) linear trends and time-varying estimates can be obtained from February 2019 with this model specification. For the outcome of the accepted applications for the Housing Security Benefit, the reference month is March 2019 instead of January 2020 due to the lack of data. But this should not affect estimation results because the number of accepted applications for the Housing Security Benefit is negligible before the COVID-19 crisis.\nWhen it comes to effect sizes, the DID estimates by OLS and WLS with prefecture trends suggest that a one-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate has led to an increase in Public Assistance recipients of around 11-15 people per one hundred thousand population. The DID estimates for the other three programs indicate that the same unemployment increase may result in increases in the accepted applications for the Housing Security Benefit, Emergency Small Amount Fund, and General Support Funds by roughly 12-30, 24-58, and 16-41 people per one hundred thousand population in June or July respectively.\nTo sum up, the increase in the unemployment rate in the COVID-19 crisis has not clearly resulted in an increase in suicides, but it may have led to an increase in the recipients of the means-tested poverty alleviation programs."}, {"section_title": "17", "text": ".

We, however, do not find evidence that the decrease in the employment rate has led to an increase in female suicides. The employment-shock impacts on the caseloads of three poverty alleviation programs (Housing Security Benefit and the two emergency temporary loan programs) are not clear, but the effect sizes on the two loan programs may be larger than that on the Public Assistance recipients if these effects exist.\nWhen we use the COVID-19-induced increase in the unemployment rate as an alternative employment shock variable, DID estimates for the suicide rate in the COVID-19 period are not significantly different from zero in most cases. On the other hand, our estimates show relatively robust evidence of the positive impact on the number of Public Assistance recipients and weak but suggestive evidence of the positive impacts on the accepted applications for the other means-tested poverty alleviation programs.\nThere are several issues to be discussed regarding our findings. Here we briefly discuss three of them as concluding remarks.\nFirst, why do we observe the positive impact of employment-rate shock on only male, not female, suicides? One possible explanation is that, although the COVID-19 employment shock itself is larger for female workers than male workers (Kikuchi et al. 2020 ), a persistent decrease in female employment in the COVID-19 pandemic is largely due to the job loss of part-time or married female workers who may not be breadwinners in their households. 9 The financial and psychological distress of job loss or temporary job retirement for this female cohort may thus have been milder than that of male workers who have lost their jobs in the COVID-19 crisis, at least on average. However, given the higher increase in female suicides than that in male suicides in the COVID-19 period, this interpretation should be considered as speculative and requiring further examination.\nSecond, why do we observe the employment-shock impact on male suicides only when the employment or LFP rate, not the unemployment rate, is used as the indica-9 Documents and statistics presented in the \"Study Group on the Impacts and Challenges for Women under the COVID-19\" held by the Gender Equality Bureau Cabinet Office (https://www.gender.go.jp/kaigi/kento/covid-19/index.html) provide useful information about female employment under the COVID-19 crisis."}, {"section_title": "18", "text": ".

One possibility is that the decrease in the male labor force is related to an increase in the male population with a high risk of suicide, but the increase in male unemployment is not. That is, because \"unemployed workers\" are those who are currently not working but are willing and able to work for pay, the short-term increase in unemployment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may not be an appropriate indicator to capture the increasing population who are at the brink of suicide. Another possible reason is that the magnitude and the variation of the unemployment-rate shock in Japan is not large enough to have a detectable impact on suicides.\nThird, how can we interpret the robustly positive but relatively small impact of all three employment-shock variables on Public Assistance recipients and imprecise but suggestive impact on the other means-tested poverty alleviation programs? We consider these results an indication that the COVID-19 employment shock has unarguably increased financial distress, and the means-tested benefits and temporary loan programs have partly alleviated such distress. At the same time, the Public Assistance scheme has strict certification criteria and this may be the reason the estimated effect size is somewhat small even though the estimates are relatively precise. On the other hand, the other three benefit and loan programs are accessible to a larger number of people, but this also implies that the relation between the employment status and the utilization of these programs is relatively weak. Of course, data limitation is another non-negligible feature in our analysis of these three poverty alleviation programs.\nFinally, while we provide some evidence of the impact of the COVID-19 employment shock on suicides and poverty alleviation programs, we cannot address whether the poverty alleviation programs have mitigated suicides under the COVID-19 crisis. This is a much more difficult task because of the endogenous determination of the poverty alleviation programs, but future research on this question should be undertaken."}, {"section_title": "22", "text": ".
