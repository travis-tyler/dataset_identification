Regardless of clinical diagnosis, high levels of NFL are general indicators of axonal damage. Accumulating evidence has indicated that the plasma NFL is useful for predicting and monitoring progression in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) [1] . Increase in plasma NFL is well established in neurodegenerative pathology, but the genetic contribution to this change AGING needs further research [2] [3] [4] . Previous studies suggested that the candidate biomarkers can be used as endophenotypes in genome-wide association study (GWAS) [5] [6] [7] . In a previous study, baseline plasma NFL data were used to explore genetic factors [8] .\nSince inter-individual variability may exist in the disease trajectories, cross-sectional data have limitations with respect to the evaluation of clinical disease progression. Longitudinal changes in plasma NFL may provide important insights into genetic mechanism underlying these diseases. All samples from the subjects in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort were measured longitudinally for changes in plasma NFL levels. Thus, we can use the plasma NFL to carry out longitudinal tracking of AD-related indicators over extended periods of time. In this study, we present the first GWAS of the rate of change in plasma NFL among non-demented elders (cognitive normals (CN) or those diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)). We hope to identify novel variants specific to the longitudinal changes in plasma NFL levels."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of included subjects", "text": "After quality control (QC), 545 non-Hispanic white participants from the ADNI with longitudinal plasma NFL data were included. Detailed information of included subjects is presented in Table 1 .

We obtained a residual plasma NFL change rate for each individual. Continuous quantitative change rates were primary outcome measures used in the genetic association studies."}, {"section_title": "Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the rate of increase in plasma NFL", "text": "A total of 1,231,747 genotyped variants were included in GWAS. Three SNPs (rs16840041, p=4.50\u00d710 -8 ; rs2269714, p=4.50\u00d710 -8 ; rs2269715, p=4.83\u00d710 -8 ) were significantly associated with the rate of increase in plasma NFL ( Figure 1A and Table 2 ). Other SNPs with suggestive associations are listed in Supplementary  Table 1 . Quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot shows no evidence of population stratification, as most of the observed p-values do not deviate from the expected line (Supplementary Figure 3) . The Haploview software was used to conduct linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis between these SNPs. Rs16840041 was in high LD (r 2 >0.8) with other two SNPs (rs2269714 and rs2269715) in CD1A (Supplementary Figure 4) .\nIn the CD1A region, several SNPs in LD with rs16840041 showed values of p < 0.001 for the longitudinal changes in plasma NFL ( Figure 1B ). However, after controlling for the genotypes of rs16840041, no strong associations remained in this region ( Figure 1C ), indicating that all the associations in this locus were driven by the three SNPs. Moreover, we identified that the minor allele of rs16840041-A was associated with a significant increase in plasma NFL levels ( Figure 2A ). Figure 2B shows Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the probability of clinical disease progression in the different rs16840041 genotype subgroups. The GG group was significantly associated with longer estimated time of clinical disease progression (6.26 \u00b1 0.19 years, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.88-6.64), compared with the AA/AG group (4.86 \u00b1 0.50 years, 95% CI 3.90-5.82, p = 0.006). In Cox regression models (adjusted for age, diagnosis and APOE4 status), the individuals with AA/AG genotype had higher risk of progression to AD (hazard ratio 1.63, 95% CI 1.12-2.36, p = 0.010) (Supplementary Table 2 )."}, {"section_title": "CD1A rs16840041-A affects the risk of clinical disease progression", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Impact of rs16840041 on other AD-related phenotypes", "text": "In the post hoc analyses, we identified 355 subjects in all diagnostic groups with longitudinal [ 18 (MMSE) , and the volume of AD-related brain regions, we did not observe any significant differences in the rates of change between AA/AG and GG genotypes (Figure 3 )."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In this study, we identified significant associations between genetic variants and the rates of change in plasma NFL among non-demented elders. Three SNPs (rs16840041, rs2269714 and rs2269715) within CD1A in high LD were associated with increased plasma NFL levels. In the other longitudinal frameworks, individuals with the minor alleles showed a higher risk of cognitive decline, and the minor alleles (rs16840041, A; rs2269714, T; rs2269715, G) were significantly associated with an accelerated decline of [ 18 F] FDG in the entire cohort. "}, {"section_title": "AGING", "text": "\nThe three variations are located on chromosome 1q23.1 within CD1A region. The CD1A gene encodes a member of the CD1 family (CD1A, CD1B, CD1C, CD1D, and CD1E) of transmembrane glycoproteins [9] . CD1A proteins are important molecules presenting glycolipid and lipid antigens of microbial origin or themselves to T cells [10, 11] . Thus, T cells can sense and respond to changes in lipid repertoire (inflammation, infection and malignancies) [12] .\nSelf-reactive T cells (specific for self-glycosphingolipids) were identified in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. These T cells were restricted by all types of CD1 molecules [13] . CD1A expression was significantly increased in MS patients [14, 15] . Moreover, Caporale et al.' study suggested that CD1A gene polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to MS [16] . The increased CD1A expression can cause inappropriate presentation of self-lipid antigen and may be one of the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to MS. In addition to self-proteins, self-glycolipids may represent the potential source of autoantigens recognized by T cells in autoimmune diseases [13] . Once activated, CD1self-reactive T cells could regulate both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses [17] . It has been reported that several autoimmune diseases and neurodegenerative diseases (AD, Parkinson disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD)) share the same genetic pathways [18] [19] [20] .\nPrevious studies have identified that the minor allele (T) of rs2269714 elevated the expression levels of CD1A in blood samples [21] . The elevated expression of CD1A was associated with peripheral inflammation (skin inflammation, ulcerative colitis, and rheumatoid arthritis, etc.) [22] [23] [24] . Secreted by CD1A-reactive T cells, a variety of cytokines (IL-13, IL-22, IL-17A, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and GM-CSF et al.) participated in inflammation, wound healing and defense against infection [24] [25] [26] . Inflammatory mediators or cytokines that are induced at the site of inflammation can enter the blood. These inflammatory signals could spread into central nervous system (CNS) through microglia [27] . Macrophages and microglia (cells of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage) play key roles in inflammation of chronic neurodegenerative disease [28] . It has been reported that peripheral immune stimuli can lead to differential epigenetic reprogramming of macrophages and microglia, cause long-term alterations in the brain immune response, and then affect the severity of miscellaneous neurodegenerative diseases, including AD [29] . Interestingly, this immune memory can also be elicited by individual cytokines [29] . In miscellaneous neurodegenerative diseases (AD, PD, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)), neuroinflammation is typified by a reactive morphology of glial cells (astrocytes and microglia) [30] . Moreover, the roles of peripheral inflammation in the development of multi-infarct dementia and AD have also been reported [31] . In summary, previous studies have indicated that the CD1A-related immune activation and peripheral inflammation may be important mechanisms contributing to neurodegenerative diseases.\nAs an important neuroimaging biomarker of metabolic abnormalities, [ 18 F] FDG-PET can reflect the magnitude of cerebral hypometabolism [32] . Peripheral inflammation has been reported to reduce glucose metabolism in human medial temporal lobe (MTL) and impair human spatial memory [33] . But the molecular mechanism through which rs16840041 could affect human MTL function has not been studied yet. The decline rates of [\n18 F] FDG were significantly associated with minor allele (A), further indicating the potential role of these SNPs in neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, previous studies suggested that anti-CD1a antibody can reduce inflammation, indicating that blocking the interaction of CD1a with receptors on T cells could be a potential treatment for neurodegenerative diseases [34] . While the specific biological pathways underlying the role of CD1A in the vulnerability of neurodegenerative diseases require further investigation, the results reported here suggest that CD1A may be important for monitoring dementia progression at the individual level and evaluating early indicators of dementia. Moreover, those results also suggest that CD1A should be considered as a potential therapeutic target in dementia.\n\nof AD-related brain regions has been reported to be closely associated with cognitive state.
