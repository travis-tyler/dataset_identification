[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Tyrosine is precursor for monoamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine (DA), which is one of the key neurotransmitters in the frontostriatal network and of crucial relevance for mental disorders. Recent research reported that high dose tyrosine application resulted in increased brain DA synthesis,which is consistent with the observation of a positive association between daily tyrosine intake and cognitive test performance. In the present study, weinvestigated the associations between working memory (WM) dependent tasksand everyday tyrosine intake of healthy old humans by additionally including brain functional data. We observed a negative correlation between tyrosine intake and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) between the striatum and the inferior prefrontal cortex. That is to say, we found higher rsFC in individuals consuming less tyrosine per day. At the same time, higher rsFC or hyperconnectivity was associated with lower WM performance. These findings suggest thatlower or insufficient supply of tyrosine might result in dysfunctional connectivity between striatal and frontal regions leading to lower WM capacity in healthy old humans."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In times of superannuation of the population, it becomes ever more important for people to stay healthy over the course of their whole lifetime. One main aspect of age-related health problems is cognitive deterioration. While most people think it is possible to prevent cognitive impairment due to ageing, a lot of them are not sure how to do so (Vaportzis&Gow, 2018) . Alongside with physical exercise and improvement in healthcare, nutrition has gotten into focus as a contributor in achieving this goal. Over the past few years, we gained a better insight of several different nutrients and their role in the healthy human brain. One of them is tyrosine, an essential amino acid, which is present in protein rich food (e.g. almonds, eggs, salmon). It serves as the precursor of catecholamine neurotransmitters (CA) (dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine). The rate-limiting step in the synthesis of CA is the enzyme tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH). Besides various other factors, research suggests an influence of precursor availability on the activity of TH in mammalian brains (Wurtman et al. 1974 ) due to TH not being fully saturated most of the time (Carlsson & Lindqvist, 1978) . Substrate availability corresponds to tyrosine levels in the brain. Brain levels of tyrosine may vary as a function of its availability in the blood (Fernstrom & Fernstrom, 2007) ,due to a direct link between blood and brain concentrations of tyrosine. For this reason, nutrition might have an impact on brain CA synthesis and activity, due to nutritional intake determining blood levels of tyrosine (Moja et al., 1996) .\nSynthesis and metabolism of CA neurotransmitters, in particular dopamine (DA), has a variety of effects on the central nervous system. Evidence provided by pharmacological intervention shows its importance in cognitive processes. Early animal studies have shown that depletion of DA in regions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) had effects on working memory (WM) in monkeys similar to surgical ablation of the same area (Brozoski et al., 1979) .\nPharmacological intervention using levodopa (L-Dopa, a DA precursor) reversed those drugmediated effects of dopamine depletion. Subsequent animal studies showed similar effects of DA modulation in the PFC and impaired cognitive function (Arnsten, 1989; Watanabe et al., 1997) . Research in healthy human volunteers provided further evidence for the relationship between DA and cognition. Administration of DA D2 receptor antagonists to reduce DA transmission led to impaired spatial working memory performance (Mehta et al., 1999) , while low doses of an agonist improved performance (Luciana et al., 1998) . However, this correlation is not linear, meaning higher doses of a DA agonist or DA brain levels itself do not always result in better performance. In fact,the relationship resembles more an inverted Ushape, meaning too low or too high levels can impair cognitive control and effects are highly dependent on the basal supply of neurotransmitters (Cools &D'Esposito, 2011) . Therefore, maintaining an optimal level of DA seems to be crucial. Besides direct manipulation of transmitter signaling in drugs, manipulation of the precursor tyrosine had similar effects on cognition. For example, depletion of tyrosine led to a lower release of DA and impaired cognitive performance in healthy volunteers (Harmer et al., 2001) . This shows the importance of a constant supply of tyrosine for maintaining DA synthesis and signaling. In addition, former research has shown tyrosine intake can also enhance WM performance and reverse negative effects of stress in WM tasks (Banderet & Lieberman, 1989; Shurtleff et al. 1994; Thomas et al., 1999; Deijen et al., 1999) . This suggests tyrosine to be especially effective in times of high demand or lower basal levels of DA (e.g. under stressful conditions).\nFurthermore, ingestion of tyrosine rich food improved WM capacity and task-related functional connectivity between the PFC and striatum compared to food missing tyrosine (Nagano-Saito et al., 2008) . These findings show that tyrosine-mediated effects are not limited to altering cognition but also affect functional brain connectivity. Another example for decline of the DAergic system is a pathological condition known as Parkinson's disease (PD).\nHere dopamine depletion within the striatum leads to loss of cognitive and motor abilities.Impairments linked to this condition are rather specific for frontostriatal cognitive function (Lange et al., 1992; Owen et al., 1992; Lees & Smith, 1983) . Additionally, as shown by neuroimaging studies, lower activity within the PFC and striatum can be observed in PD patients, while performing a WM capacity depending cognitive task (Owen et al., 1998; Lewis et al., 2003) . At the same time, studies on healthy humans have provided evidence for a correlation between higher DA synthesis in the striatum and higher WM capacity (Cools &D'Esposito, 2011) . That is to say, WM performance may serve as a predictor for striatal DA synthesis capacity (Cools et al., 2008) . Interestingly research has also shown an effect of nutritional tyrosine on DA release in striatal areas (Montgomery et al., 2003) . That is why tyrosine blood levels might influence the DAergic system by changes of DA in prefrontal and striatal regions, due to precursor availability, leading to changes in WM task performance and functional connectivity within the frontostriatal network. So far, most research focused on administration of relatively high doses of tyrosine immediately before the tests. To investigate real-life effects of differences in daily dietary tyrosine intake, we recently monitored nutritional behavior as well as cognitive function of healthy adults. The results showed associations between higher everyday tyrosine intake and better WM capacity in younger and older adults (K\u00fchn et al., 2017) .\nAnother rather natural cause of changes in the DAergic system accompanied by cognitive decline is age. Evidence shows an age-related reduction in DA activity in the brain, associated with the decline of motor and cognitive functions (Volkow et al. 1998) . Precisely, striatal impairment in DA metabolism and signaling correlates with cognitive deterioration in healthy old humans (Vernaleken et al., 2007; Erixon-Lindroth et al., 2005; B\u00e4ckman et al., 2000) . In contrast, research suggests DA synthesis capacity to be upregulated with age, possibly as a tool to compensate for reduced signaling (Braskie et al., 2008) . Thus, previously described effects of tyrosine availability on cognition and its effectiveness in times of high demand, might be especially prevalent in senescent adults, due to age-related decline of the DA metabolism and therefore higher DA demand.\nGiven the evidence stated above, we hypothesized a positive effect of a tyrosine rich diet on brain connectivity and WM capacity. To investigate this, we first analyzed data of nutritional behavior and functional brain connectivity. We assessed the everyday intake of tyrosine via a food frequency questionnaire. Subsequently, we analyzed resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in fMRI in association to tyrosine intake. Functional connections between PFC and striatum are in close relationship with working memory and can be monitored by rsFC (Di Martino et al., 2008) . Previous work has shown pharmacological manipulation of DA, as the one described above, influencesrsFC of the frontostriatal network (Cole et al., 2013) . A recent study revealed hyperconnectivity of striatal and prefrontal regions in patients suffering from early stages of PD. Administration of L-DOPA mitigated this abnormal rsFC (Kwak et al., 2010) . Therefore, under the assumption of dietary tyrosine influencing the DAergic system, we expected to see a correlation between individual tyrosine intake and rsFC of the PFC and the striatum. We focused our research on a group of healthy old humans (older than 60 years) of the Berlin Aging Study II (https://www.base2.mpg.de/en), since they display higher variability of WM performance due to age-related cognitive decline. Furthermore, we expected effects of dietary tyrosine to be more prevalent in old age, due to higher demand of DA supply in age. Additionally, a broad battery of cognitive taskswas used to determine WM capacity and to search for associations between daily dietary tyrosine intake, brain connectivity and cognitive performance."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "We recruited participants within the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II) (for additional information see Bertram et al.

These precursor-mediated improvements in cognitive function were also accompanied by changes in functional connectivity (rsFC) between PFC and striatum (Nagano-Saito et al., 2008) .\nBased on the research mentioned above, we hypothesized a positive effect of nutritional tyrosine on functional brain connectivity, which could explain the observed improvements in WM capacity. We used data of the Berlin Aging Study II, in particular, resting-state fMRI scans and nutritional data derived from questionnaires to check for associations between diet and rsFC. Furthermore, results of WM dependent tasks were gathered to estimate a latent factor for WM. This latent factor capturing global WM abilities enabled us to check for correlations between WM and daily tyrosine consumption, as well as associations withrsFC.\nWe focused our research on WM, due to tyrosine-mediated effects on WM being well described within the scientific literature.\nIn the present study, we provided evidence for an association between dietary tyrosine intake and functional brain connectivity. These associations were also linked to positive effects on a latent factor for WM. Our findings are in line with previous research. Using a subsample of healthy old humans, from the same data set used by K\u00fchn et al. (2017) , we were able to replicate our previous findings of higher daily tyrosine intake being associated with higher WM capacity. In addition, we found a significantly decreased rsFC between putamen and prefrontal cortex, especially IFG, in association with higher tyrosine consumption. This decrease in rsFC was likewise associated with higher WM performance. These results suggest that tyrosine-related effects differences in WM capacity in healthy old humans may possibly be a consequence of alterations in functional connectivity between striatal and frontal regions, in particular the right putamen and left IFG.\nWhat seems rather counterintuitive is the fact that increased tyrosine supply leads to decreased rsFC, that turn is associated with better WM performance. We explain this result as follows: Decreased rsFC in individuals with high tyrosine supply might represent hyperconnectivity in subjects with insufficient tyrosine supply. Therefore, hyperconnectivity is possibly a consequence of lower precursor availability and therefore lower DA synthesis in the observed regions. Similar findings can be made in pathological states of DA depletion such as patients suffering early stages of PD. PD patients off medication show hyperconnectivity in resting-state fMRI between basal and cortical regions (Kwak et al., 2010) 6 . This increased connectivity was mitigated by therapeutic administration of L-DOPA.\nThese findings fall in line with other reports on conditions of DA depletion, which have shown increased synchronous activity between basal and cortical areas (Costa et al., 2006; Gatev et al., 2006) 7,8 . According to these studies, increased synchronous activity between basal ganglia and its associated networks is a consequence of the pathological state of DA depletion. This effect of DA modulation was also shown in healthy adults. Pharmacological intervention using sulpiride, a DA antagonist leading to lower DA transmission, resulted in increased connectivity between basal ganglia and thalamic and cortical areas (Honey et al., 2008) . Therefore, hyperconnectivity between such regions seems to represent a state of dysfunctional activity coordination. Higher age is commonly accompanied by DA depletion, due to age-related decline of motor and cognitive functions being caused by impaired DA metabolism (Vernaleken et al., 2007; Erixon-Lindroth et al., 2005; B\u00e4ckman et al., 2000) 20,21,22 . To compensate this reduction of signaling, DA synthesis capacity seems to be upregulated in old humans (Braskie et al., 2008) . An upregulation of synthesis would also require additional precursor supply, hence a higher demand for tyrosine can be expected. In conclusion, higher daily tyrosine supply seems to improve cognitive function within healthy old humans, due to mitigating increased synchronous resting-state activity between striatal and frontal regions. This dysfunctional activity coordination might be a consequence of agerelated decline in DA metabolism. Higher tyrosine intake might be able to counteract this decrease in DA metabolism by increasing the synthesis rate. Our observationsin the context of former research -suggest a greater need for tyrosine in healthy old humans to possibly improve cognitive aging by counteracting effects of age-related cognitive decline.\nDietary recommendations mostly focus on overall protein intake per day and have recently been updated to fit the higher demand of people older than 60 years. Research suggests a minimal daily intake of 1.0 to 1.2 g of protein (Bauer et al., 2013) . According to this, we can expect a minimum average intake of roughly 80 g of protein per day. Within our study group 54.5% of participants consumed less than 80 g of protein, suggesting most people do not consume enough protein to satisfy their demand. Due to this, we think an increase in overall daily protein consumption, focusing on sources high in tyrosine like e.g. cheese (parmesan), soy, lean meats and fish, is an important way to address this problem, rather than taking supplements."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "The present study is limited by the assessment time points of the data. Dietary data was gathered around two years prior to the cognitive data (mean difference in days = 719, SD = 435) and MRI scans (mean difference in days = 824, SD = 430). Yet, we are convinced that the reports most likely reflect the participant's regular diet, because the questionnaire focused on a rather long period of time, in particular the last 12 months. Moreover, we cannot exclude unobserved common causes for the association between tyrosine, differences in rsFC and cognition, which would explain our observations, due to the limitations of observational data.\nFor example, there might be other nutrients frequently ingested within a tyrosine rich diet.\nHowever, due to the amount of research showing tyrosine-mediated improvement of cognitive function, we think tyrosine itself is most likely the key factor responsible for our observations.\nIn addition, socio-economic status may play an important role explaining the observed associations. Higher socio-economic status is also associatedwith higher cognitive performance, as well as higher use of nutritional supplements, adherence to certain diet rules and lower fat intake (Hulshof et al., 1991) . To control for this possible confound, we controlled for years of education as a rough approximation for the socio-economic status.\nHowever, the results were not affected by this variable. Measuring actual blood levels of tyrosine and might also be interesting, to get a more accurate idea of the subject's tyrosine supply. Therefore, we encourage future research to work in this direction, while also checking for the covariance structure of different nutrients. This may allow a deeper understanding of the role of tyrosine in cognition and high age. In addition, this might also allow us to give nutritional advice to improve cognition in healthy old humans."}, {"section_title": "Informed consent", "text": "Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.
