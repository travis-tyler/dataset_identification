[{"section_title": "", "text": "In this study, a prototype for the Chesapeake Bay inundation prediction system (CIPS) was developed using the parallel MPI version o f the ELCIRC hydrodynamic model to examine the barotropic response of the Chesapeake Bay to the November 2009 Mid-Atlantic N or'easter. A Nor'easter is a type o f large-scale storm that mostly occurs in the winter along the East Coast o f the United States. Because o f its longer duration and larger spatial scale compared to those o f a tropical cyclone (or hurricane), the nor'easter can cause severe floods to the coastal areas through cumulative effects during several tidal cycles over a prolonged period o f time. Forecast winds yielded from various atmospheric models were used as external forcings to drive the storm surge hydrodynamic model over a large domain, and the ensemble average o f model results was calculated. Based on the comparison between the ELCIRC model results and NOAA tides /water level records compared at a number o f stations in the Chesapeake Bay, the overall RMS error is 10 cm, which represents less than 5% o f error normalized by the maximum water level during that period. It was also found that the surface wind drag coefficient was affected by the fetch-limited condition in the Upper Chesapeake Bay. By implementing the revised empirical surface drag coefficient over that area, the water level prediction in the Upper Bay was notably improved. The performance o f the storm tide prediction was found to be highly dependent on the quality o f predicted winds. The ensemble forecast approach was proved to be effective in reducing uncertainty and improving the overall predictive skill o f the ELCIRC model. A high-resolution small domain grid, which incorporates detailed LiDAR topographic data over the Greater Elampton Roads area, was also employed in ELCIRC for inundation simulation during the November 2009 N or'easter. The predicted coastal inundation agreed very well with flooding records recorded by the USGS water level sensors. The CIPS' successful experience suggested that an accurate inundation prediction demands (1) high-resolution wind and pressure fields as model inputs, (2) a proper portrayal o f topography and bathymetry in the model grid, and (3) a reliable wetting-and-drying numerical scheme in the hydrodynamic model. Extra effort has been made to investigate the barotropic response o f the Bay to remote and local winds during the November 2009 N or'easter. It was found that the remote wind plays a dominant role in controlling water exchange between the continental shelf and the Chesapeake Bay through Ekman transport, while the local wind is responsible for short-term water level fluctuations inside the Bay, especially in the Upper Chesapeake Bay area. are warm-core low-pressure systems developed in the tropics N or'easters may occur at any time o f the year, but are mostly known for their formations in the winter season. These storms usually develop between Georgia and New Jersey within 100 miles o f the coastline, and are drawn across to the northeast by the je t stream. They usually strengthen while moving to the north, and reach their peak intensities while o ff the Canadian Coast, with the strength sometimes equaling that o f a strong hurricane. During a typical nor'easter, the temperature usually falls significantly, indicating the presence o f cold air. High wind gusts and heavy precipitation are also associated with a nor'easter, which can cause severe rough seas, coastal flooding, and coastline erosions. A nor'easter can be extremely devastating and damaging during winter when frozen precipitation, such as heavy snow, is involved. Though the occurrence o f a nor'easter can be forecast with certain accuracy, predicting their impact on the coastal areas is more complex and challenging. Davis and Dolan (1993) created a N or'easter intensity scale (see Appendix A) to classify those winter storms into 5 categories: 1 (Weak), 2 (Moderate), 3 (Significant), 4 (Severe), and 5 (Extreme), but it deals primarily with beach and coastal deterioration. Zielinski (2002) developed a new N or'easter intensity scale from a climatologist point o f view, which gives us more insight into the storms themselves. Basically, this new classification scheme allows forecasters and meteorologists to summarize a winter storm based on its intensity and duration. For example, a storm's category might be 3.4, reflecting its intensity with the first digit 3 and duration with the second digit 4. The potential impact o f the storm can then be passed to public service officials to help them with evacuation plans or decision-makings. However, until now, no official classification o f the November 2009 Mid-Atlantic N or'easter was published. The November 2009 Mid-Atlantic N or'easter (also referred to as \"N or'Ida\") was a powerful storm that caused widespread damage along the East Coast of the United States. This storm formed in relation to Hurricane Ida's mid-level circulation across Georgia on November 10, and lasted over 7 successive days while moving northeast across North Carolina, Virginia, Delaware, New Jersey, and Long Island. Luckily, temperatures did not drop dramatically to cause a significant snowstorm to the coastal areas, a condition for which many nor'easters are notorious. According to the surface weather analysis conducted by the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center (HPC) under the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), by November 12, the system already had attained a minimum pressure o f 992 mbar along the Eastern Shore of North Carolina. The position o f the low created a tighter pressure gradient, resulting in stronger northeasterly winds over the Chesapeake Bay. On November 13, several NOAA stations in the southern Chesapeake Bay measured maximum winds. Notably, stations at Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel and Yorktown measured wind speeds of 52 knots (26.6 m/s) and 42 knots (21.4 m/s), respectively, with maximum water levels being recorded a few hours later. The system began to weaken while slowly progressing along the Mid-Atlantic region o f the Eastern United States, but still brought strong, steady northeasterly winds combined with heavy rainfalls to the Bay. It persisted through Novem ber 17, by which time it had moved over Atlantic Canada. Overall, the Lower Chesapeake Bay was affected the most by the storm, with the Upper Chesapeake Bay and parts o f the Philadelphia area experiencing milder effects."}, {"section_title": "Coastal inundation during November 2009 Mid-Atlantic N or'easter", "text": "The November 2009 Mid-Atlantic N or'easter caused dramatic storm surge and inundation to the "}, {"section_title": "Literature review", "text": "The Chesapeake Bay, one o f the largest estuarine systems with heavily populated coastal regions along the US East Coast, is vulnerable to severe storm surge and inundation. Extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, are known to cause devastating damage to the coastal community. Recently, the nor'easter, which can deliver powerful storm surge to the Chesapeake Bay, has also drawn close attention. Nor'easters differ from tropical cyclones in that they are extra-tropical systems with a center o f rotation frequently situated off the East Coast o f North America and whose leading winds rotate onto land from the northeast. Their spatial scale coverages are on the order of 1000-1500 km and their durations range from 2-5 days. A northeaster can be especially devastating to people's lives and coastal properties during the winter season by bringing cold air from Arctic air masses, excessive precipitation, high winds, large waves, and prolonged storm surge. As a result, an efficient, real-time, event-triggered inundation prediction system is needed to assist coastal emergency managers and policy makers with decision-making and evacuation planning. During the past several decades, many storm surge studies have been conducted in the Chesapeake Bay. Harris (1956) first introduced systematic studies into storm surges on the East Coast o f the United States. In his 1963 paper on 'characteristics o f the hurricane storm surge', five distinct processes were summarized as the key factors in controlling sea water level changes in the coastal area: (1) the pressure field effect, (2) the direct wind effect, (3) the effect o f the Earth's rotation, (4) the effect o f waves, and (5) the rainfall effect. Later, based on statistical analysis o f historical events, Pore (1965) introduced two more factors that are important for the coastal surge in the Chesapeake Bay: (1) tidal elevation at the entrance o f the Chesapeake Bay, and (2) modifying effects by the coastline and bathymetry within the Bay. Based on time series analysis, Wang (1979a,b) demonstrated that water level in the Bay responded to the local and remote wind forcings differently. The coastal ocean can influence the Bay water through alongshore Ekman transport. Chuang and Boicourt (1989) indicated that resonant seiche motion could occur inside the Chesapeake Bay during a northeaster wind event. Since the early 1970s, storm surge studies using numerical models have become more popular and continue to improve by the infusion o f new science knowledge and computational technology. Jelesnianski (1972) developed the first prototype o f a storm surge model, SPLASH (the Special Program to List Amplitude o f Surges from Hurricanes). After that, the SLOSH model (Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes) was established and widely used by NOAA for coastal flooding studies in the G ulf Coast and Eastern Seaboard o f the United States (Jelesnianski, 1974;Jelesnianski et ah, 1992). Despite its popularity, the simplified numerical scheme and inability to resolve complex bathymetry and coastline boundaries using a structured grid have constrained the model's capability for further improvement. The ADCIRC model (the ADvanced CIRCulation model) is the second-generation storm surge model (Luettich et ah, 1991), which utilizes the generalized wave continuity equation (GWCE) to avoid the spurious oscillations associated with a primitive Galerkin finite element numerical scheme. It uses an unstructured finite-element mesh to represent the domain and is optimal for adding complex coastal features in varying size when needed. In recent years, due to the potential increase in the strength and frequency of storms related to global warming and sea level rise, there is renewed interest in calling for even more efficient, robust, and reliable storm surge and inundation forecast system for the US East Coast and G ulf Coast. (Valle-Levinson et al., 2002;Wang et ah, 2005;Bernier and Thompson, 2006;Kohut et ah, 2006;Li et ah, 2006;W eisberg and Zheng, 2006;Shen et ah, 2006a;2006b;2008 In this study, one o f the new breeds of unstructured grid models, ELCIRC, was employed. The ELCIRC model encompasses the following salient features: 1) It uses an unstructured grid to resolve complex bathymetry and irregular coastlines. 2) It includes an efficient solver, which allows it to be less restricted by the CFL condition. 3) It allows a robust wetting-and-drying numerical scheme for inundation simulation. Given the above features o f the model, plus the boost o f the parallel computing technique, it is promising to further establish it as a fast, robust, and reliable Chesapeake Bay Inundation Prediction System (CIPS) for forecast purposes."}, {"section_title": "Objectives and outline", "text": "The objective of this study is to build an efficient operational inundation forecast system for the Chesapeake Bay. Various forecast winds will be used as external forcings to drive the ELCIRC hydrodynamic model for storm surge and inundation simulations during the November 2009 Mid-Atlantic N or'easter. In addition, sensitivity tests will be conducted to investigate the remote and local wind effects, as well as the influence o f continental shelf dynamics on water level fluctuations inside the Bay during this storm. In order to fulfill the objective o f developing a real-time storm surge and inundation forecast system for the Chesapeake Bay, several issues need to be addressed. 1) Both the storm surge in a large domain and the on-land inundation must be considered. 2) The implementation o f the real-time forecast needs to be made operational. 3) The uncertainty introduced by different weather forecasts should be accounted for. The following strategy and approach was adopted to deal with the issues mentioned above. 1) An approach o f coupling a large domain grid with a high-resolution small domain grid was adopted for both storm surge and inundation simulation purposes. 2) A parallel MPI version of the ELCIRC hydrodynamic model was employed to improve the efficiency o f storm surge forecasts. 3) To account for the uncertainty introduced by different weather forecasts, ensemble forecasts were conducted to improve the overall predictive skill of the ELCIRC model. and is the basis for many regional models. This model runs four times a day and produces forecasts up to 16 days in advance, with decreasing spatial and temporal resolutions over time. There are other well-known global atmospheric models being applied in different countries like Canada and the United Kingdom, which will not be discussed in this study. Currently, the GFS deployed by the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) has a horizontal resolution o f 32 km, which is inadequate to resolve the detailed wind fields over the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Therefore, various regional atmospheric models are being applied for more desirable weather predictions. Regional models are also known as limited-area models (LAMs). They use a compatible global model to provide boundary conditions at the edge of the regional domain, and employ much finer grid spacing in order to resolve smaller-scale meteorological phenomena. Time steps for regional models are usually between one and four minutes, chosen to maintain numerical stability while considering computational demands. The advantage o f using regional atmospheric models is that they allow for significant improvements in predicting tropical cyclone track and detailed wind fields over land. The WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) model is a mesoscale numerical weather prediction system designed to serve both operational forecasting and atmospheric research needs.

Specifically, three sets o f forecast winds, including the 12-km resolution NAM wind, the 4-km resolution WRF wind, and the 2-km resolution RAMS wind, were employed to drive the ELCIRC hydrodynamic model for storm surge and inundation predictions inside the Chesapeake during the November 2009 Mid-Atlantic N or'easter.

The evaluations o f wind speed and wind direction were done separately. Figure   4.10 compares the wind speed between observed and predicted winds, and Figure 4.11 compares the wind direction. It can be seen that the wind direction was predicted veiy well by all forecast winds, but the wind speed at certain stations, especially the middle-Bay stations, tended to be over-predicted. Further evaluation o f each forecast wind was conducted by calculating its statistical measures, as shown in Table 4.4.        The WRF-GFS regional forecast wind, which has both higher temporal and spatial resolutions than the GFS global forecast wind, compared favorably with observational data throughout the Chesapeake Bay. In particular, the predictions at CBBT and Baltimore were superior. At these two stations, the RMS and relative error of the WRF-GFS were relatively low compared to those o f the other forecast winds. However, considerably large discrepancies can be found at Kiptopeke and Tolchester as well, where the relative error reached 41.23% and 74.07%, respectively. The average skill score o f the WRF-GFS forecast wind is 0.81. Generally speaking, the predictive skills o f the NAM forecast wind and the WRF-GFS wind are comparable. The RAMS-GFS forecast wind, which has a very fine resolution o f 2 km, is considered to be the most reliable wind in this study.     It should be noted that most tidal stations are located at water-land margins, where the wind fields are more complex than those of the open water. When wind is blowing from land to water, a higher surface roughness over land would reduce the wind velocity significantly. A careful examination of the wind fields at Kiptopeke and Tolchester suggested that the observed wind speeds were significantly weaker than those predicted. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that, during the 2009 November Mid-Atlantic Nor'easter when the northeast wind was dominant, meteorological sensors at these stations were blocked from receiving the NE wind by land. For more accurate assessment of forecast winds in the future, more stations should be included. Therefore, a definite conclusion for the forecast winds evaluation would be hard to draw. Based on current evidence, the RAMS-GFS wind with the highest resolution seemed to perform better than either the NAM wind or the WRF-GFS wind. Flowever, it is our belief that each forecast wind is sufficient to be used as external forcing in the hydrodynamic ELCIRC model for storm surge and inundation predictions.

There is a strong indication that this phenomenon might be caused by the over-estimation of surface wind stress in the Upper Bay area, which induced the local set-down. discrepancy was attributed to the inadequate representation of hydrodynamics in the C&D canal (see Figure 4.31) that connects the Chesapeake Bay and the Delaware Bay. After a careful examination o f the water level and flow field at NOAA station Reedy Point, however, it was found that the total volume transport through the canal was too small to have a major impact on the water level fluctuation in the Upper Bay. (2) It was also suspected that the discrepancy was due to the imperfection of the predicted wind fields in the Upper Bay area. Evaluations of forecast winds in Section 4.2 suggest that there was a slight tendency o f over-estimation o f wind speed at certain Upper Bay stations. However, this error could also come from bias in the meteorological observations. Given the fact that all forecast winds tended to under-predict the water level in the Upper Bay, other factors other than the predicted wind itself could be the cause o f the discrepancy. (3) It was suspected that the parameterization of surface wind drag coefficient in the Upper Bay area was not appropriate. In this study, the drag coefficient Caused in the ELCIRC model was determined based on Large and Pond's (1981)    The mechanism by which waves influence on the air/water coupling is such that the wave profile produces additional roughness, thereby increasing the friction and enhancing the momentum flux from the air to the water. The amount o f momentum flux depends on the significant wave height H 1/3 or on the steepness H 1/3/ X o f the waves. A large number o f measurements have been carried out to quantify the wave effect on the wind drag coefficient. Figure 4.33 (a) shows the data collected predominantly in the lake and reservoirs by various measurement techniques, including the profile method (fitting logarithmic vertical profiles to measured wind velocity), the direct method (measuring the stress), and the dissipation method by determining dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) in the inertial sub-range, were reviewed by Wuest and Lorke (2003). Despite the large scatter, it is relatively clear that the drag coefficient depends, to a large extent, on wind speed and on the wave development state as well. From these two factors, one must first consider the situation o f developed waves at different wind speeds. There are basically two ranges to be described independently: wind larger than 5 m/s and wind below 5 m/s. For strong winds (>5 m/s) the surface roughness is determined by the height of the gravity waves, and subsequently, friction is dominated by those waves. Charnock (1955) found the relation between wind speed, height o f measurement, and the wave height scale. Introducing the Charnock relation into the wind stress equation, the relation was obtained and plotted in Figure 4.33 (a). The theoretical result was excellent, but the procedure is questionable because the conversion of roughness height Z0 can generate large uncertainties. The uncertainties o f a factor o f 10 in Z0 translate to uncertainties o f a factor o f 2 in C^. For weak winds (<5 m/s) the influence o f gravity waves on surface stress eases, and the surface tension or small-scale capillary waves-generated \"virtual\" roughness become increasingly important (Wu, 1994). At low wind speed (<3 m/s), the experimental values o f Cj (Yelland and Taylor, 1996;Bradley et al., 1991;Simon et ah, 2002) consistently increase faster with decreasing wind. Astonishingly enough, such weak winds can have drag coefficients larger than those for 25 m/s winds. In Figure 4.33 (a), the surprising result o f the comparison o f the low-and high-wind regime reveals that there is a minimum drag coefficient at approximately 4-5 m/s. This is very different from the open ocean result represented by Garratt (1977) and Large and Pond (1981), shown as the dotted line in  (ocean, lakes, reservoirs, and estuarine water). Whether this is due to the special condition in the estuarine water, such as the presence o f the strong stratification and its effect on the small-scale turbulence, is unknown and yet to be determined by future research. If the LSS data were extrapolated from Uio values ranging from 10 m/s to 2 0 m/s, this can translate to a factor-of-2 difference on the value o f Cj obtained, which is precisely the uncertainty that exists in the Charnock relationship due to the uncertainty from the estimation o f Z0. Given the understanding of the above relation, a different wind drag coefficient relationship can be generated for the fetch-limited condition in the Upper Bay. A revised wind-drag coefficient formula based on LSS formula (Lin et ah, 2002) is given by Cd = (0.643 + 0.0467|W |) x 10'3, ,which was adopted in the region of the Upper Bay north o f the Patuxent River. For the remainder o f the domain spanning the coastal ocean and the Lower Bay, the LP formula was still used in the revised storm surge simulation for the November 2009 Northeaster. The use o f the LP formula is justifiable because, in the Lower Bay, a larger area is available for the wind fetch and the propagation o f the swell through the Bay mouth into the Lower Bay more resembles the coastal ocean condition. As it was found that during the Hurricane wind there is a reduction o f wind drag coefficient (Powell et al., 2003), we assume that there is a maximum cap for the wind drag coefficient C<y under a constant value o f 0 .0 0 1 1 when the wind is exceeding 12 m/s from the northeast. Using the LSS formula and the cap for maximum wind drag coefficient in the Upper Bay area, the simulated waters level at the Upper Bay stations were greatly improved.     When the fetch-limited wind drag formula was only applied from 11/11/2009 12:00 GMT to 11/13/2009 12:00 GMT in the storm surge simulation, model results were even better compared to the baseline, as shown in Figure 4.37 through Figure 4.39. The RMS errors were calculated at each station and shown in bar graphs in Figure 4.40, which obviously suggests a significant improvement on water level prediction in the Upper Bay.       Table 4.7. It can be seen that the maximum water elevation was mostly recorded around 11/13/2009 00:00 GMT, around which time the highest surges were also spotted at NOAA tidal gauge stations near the Bay mouth. At Langley and Norfolk, inundation heights reached more than 2 m during the storm.  water elevation generated by the NAM wind at the selected 6 locations. It can be seen that the overall trend o f water level fluctuation was well caught, but the peaks were under-predicted at all 6 stations. Simulated maximum water elevations generated by NAM were shown in Table 4.8. The discrepancies found at Messick, Poquoson, Langley, and Seaford reached more than 0.23 m. As the simulated storm tide yielded from the NAM wind was slightly under-predicted at the Lower Bay stations, this explained why the simulated inundation was under-predicted as well.  Inundation yielded from the WRF-GFS wind was compared to the USGS measurements in Figure   4.43. Different from the previous run, it was found that this model run over-predicted the peak at all 6 locations, with discrepancies ranging from 0.2 m to 0.32 m. Simulated maximum water elevations generated by WRF-GFS wind could be found in Table 4.8 as well. This could be explained by the fact that the storm tides generated by the WRF-GFS wind were significantly over-predicted in the Lower Bay as well. With more water being piled up along the coast by the simulated surge, higher inundation water levels could be expected. The RAMS-GFS wind had the best performance on inundation predictions, since it was the most reliable wind available in this study. This thought was well justified. In order to reduce model uncertainties introduced by different forecast winds, the ensemble average o f inundation results was calculated and compared to each individual run, shown in Figure 4.45. It was found that the ensemble average did behave better in catching the surge peak by offsetting the model errors. Although this ensemble approach showed certain merits, it should be used with caution, especially under the circumstance that the quality o f its individual members is hard to control. In general, it was well determined that the ELCIRC model has a good ability in handling the wetting-and-drying accurately and robustly. It was also demonstrated that a highresolution, reliable wind field is necessary for the ELCIRC model to yield better inundation predictions. Last but not least, the ensemble ocean forecast approach showed merits in reducing model uncertainties, but should be used with caution. An exact inundation map for the lower Chesapeake Bay during the November 2009 Mid-Atlantic N or'easter would be hard to draw. As a CIPS partner, Noblis ('http://noblis.org) has generated preliminary inundation maps based on the ELCIRC model results. However, evaluation of those maps would be difficult due to a lack o f spatial flooding measurements. More effort should be made on inundation visualization and evaluation in the future.   -11/11 11/12 11/13 11/14 11/15 11/16 GMT (2009)    As indicated in the previous chapter, three sets o f 6 -day continuous simulations were conducted, and the ensemble average was calculated to assess the overall predictive skill o f the ELCIRC model. It should be noted that the forecast winds being employed were post-processing winds, generated by piecing together the real-time forecasts published every 6 hours. It is a good exercise to use continuous winds in the hindcast. However, in the forecast mode, wind fields can only be used as given. A prototype for the Chesapeake Bay real-time ensemble ocean forecast was built up in this study, and its feasibility was tested through a series o f experiments. Forecasts were set up for the period o f 11/12/09 00:00 GMT to 11/14/09 00:00 GMT. Every 6 hours there would be 3 new forecasts being initiated by the NAM forecast wind, the WRF-GFS forecast wind, and the RAMS-GFS forecast wind, and made available at that time. Specifically, forecasts were initiated at 11/12/09 00:00 GMT, 11/12/09 06:00 GMT, 11/12/09 12:00 GMT, 11/12/09 18:00 GMT, 11/13/09 00:00 GMT, 11/13/09 06:00 GMT, 11/13/09 12:00 GMT, and 11/13/09 18:00 GMT, separately. The ensemble forecast results were examined at Lower Bay Station Sewells Point only to give an example. Figure 5.1 shows the behavior of the ELCIRC model in its forecast mode using the NAM wind. Each line with a unique color represents a forecast run starting at a different time. It was demonstrated that an ocean forecast tended to diverge from the true ocean state, as it extended into the future. Forecasts yielded from the WRF-GFS and the RAMS-GFS winds shown in Figure   5.2 and Figure 5.3 also revealed the same problem. Thus, it is our belief that the ensemble forecast approach should be evoked in the real-time ocean forecast to reduce uncertainty.     Based on Blain et al. (1994), the size of the model domain is crucial for storm surge modeling in the Gulf of Mexico. The domain size can affect the storm surge prediction inside the Chesapeake Bay as well (Shen and Gong, 2008). Open boundary for a large domain can be specified using The effect of remote and local wind effect on water elevation inside the Chesapeake Bay has been well documented (Wang and Elliott, 1978;Wang, 1979a;. To further investigate the relative importance of the remote and local wind effects during the November 2009 Mid-Atlantic Forecasi starting at 18.001 1 /13/2009 at Sewells Nor'easter, two sets of model simulations were conducted using this coupling approach mentioned above. For Scenario 1, wind forcing was only applied inside the Chesapeake Bay; for Scenario 2, wind forcing was only applied outside the Chesapeake Bay. The base run includes both the local and remote winds. In this study, the RAMS-GFS wind was used in both scenarios.  After the large domain runs were finished for both scenarios, two sets o f time-series water level data were extracted at the open boundary o f the small domain, referred to as Boundary 1 and Boundary 2. Examinations o f the two boundaries suggest that Boundary 1 resembles more a tidal boundary, while Boundary 2 incorporates not only the tidal signal but also a surge signal. It becomes obvious that the surge must be induced by the remote wind being applied in Scenario 2. After the small domain runs were finished for both scenarios, simulated water level fluctuations were examined at 11 NOAA tidal gauge stations as well. Figure 5.12 through Figure 5.14 compare the simulated water levels induced by the local and remote winds to the baseline at CBBT, Windmill Pt., and Annapolis. It was well noted that, with the remote wind being eliminated in Scenario 1, the storm surge induced by the local wind was negligible compared to that o f the baseline, and a significant set-down was spotted in the Upper Bay region caused by the local wind. In Scenario 2 where the local wind was eliminated, the storm tide induced by the remote wind agreed well with the baseline in the Fower Bay area, and the surge signal propagated from the Bay mouth to the Upper Bay without too much attenuation. If we superimpose the surge generated in Scenario 1 with the surge generated in Scenario 2, as shown in Figure 5.15 through Figure 5.17, the resulting total water elevation is very close to the baseline. Based on the analysis of model results, it is found that the mechanisms o f storm surge are quite different in the lower and the Upper Bay region. In the lower Chesapeake Bay, water level fluctuations are more sensitive to the remote wind than to the local wind. Thus, significant surge near the Bay mouth is mainly caused by the remote wind effect. However, what happens in the Upper Bay is quite different. While the surge signal induced by the remote wind effect propagating from the Fower Bay to the Upper Bay still causes a set-up, a strong local wind effect acts oppositely to produce a major set-down. The total water level fluctuation in the Upper Bay area is affected by the combination of these two effects. As we may recall, storm tide simulation "}, {"section_title": "Influence o f continental shelf dynamics on storm surge inside the Bay", "text": "Ekman dynamics (Pond and Pickard, 1998) describe the theoretical state o f water circulation for a steady wind blowing over an infinitely deep and wide ocean with constant density, assuming a balance between the friction (wind stress and vertical eddy viscosity) and Coriolis. The analytical solution shows the surface currents at a 45-degree angle to the right o f the wind direction in the northern hemisphere, and rotating with depth in a spiral known as the Ekman spiral. The vertical integration o f the velocity suggests that the net transport is to the right o f the surface wind stress, which is known as the Ekman transport. The details o f the Ekman layer structure depend on several assumptions, which are no longer true in shallow water situation. When translating from theory to practical application in the model, issues o f concern are as follows: (1) The pressure gradient is seldom negligible with the presence o f the coast. (2) The most important assumption, and the one associated with the greatest uncertainty, concerns the process o f momentum transfer from the sea surface to greater depths. Transfer o f momentum in the ocean is achieved by turbulence. Unlike viscosity, turbulence is not a property o f the medium, but o f the flow; its intensity and structure depend on the current shear, the stratification, the wave field, the roughness o f the ocean floor, and other factors. To describe the effect o f turbulent momentum transfer in exact detail requires the knowledge o f the details o f the eddy field which, under most circumstances, is an impossible task. (3) The simple relationship between the direction o f the wind and the direction o f the Ekman layer transport in the deep ocean is valid only when the total water depth is larger than the depth of the Ekman layer. In the shallow water, however, it is not guaranteed that the water depth will always be larger than the Ekman layer. In that case, the Ekman spiral will be significantly modified. The above issues were addressed in the ELCIRC hydrodynamic model with corresponding strategies. (1) It added the pressure gradient term in the shallow water equation. (2) It included multiple choices for parameterization o f turbulent vertical mixing in the model. Since the surface Ekman layer is a result o f wind action, it is also assumed that the wind wave-induced turbulence elements during the storm is important. The particle movement in wind waves is close to an orbital path in a vertical plane. The diameters o f the orbital paths decrease exponentially with depth; hence the wind wave-induced turbulence eddy viscosity was included and it decreases exponentially with depth. 3The realistic topography and shoreline were implemented in the model grid. A benchmark test on simulating Ekman motion in the ELCIRC model can be found at: (http://www.ccalmr.ORi.edu/CQRlE/modeliim/elcirc/bench/ekman benchZ2.htm 1). The Ekman transport has been cited as one o f the key mechanisms in controlling subtidal water level fluctuation inside the Chesapeake during long periods o f wind forcing (Wang and Elliott, 1978). During the November 2009 Mid-Atlantic N or'easter, a strong and prolonged northeast wind was dominant over the Chesapeake Bay, as well as its adjacent Atlantic W est Coast. The contribution o f Ekman transport depends on the magnitude o f wind forcing, period, and wind directions. We would expect that the westward Ekman transport had a huge impact on the water exchange between the Bay and the continental shelf, and thus on the total water level fluctuations inside the Bay. In this section, the Ekman effect on storm surge prediction inside the Chesapeake Bay during the November 2009 Mid-Atlantic N or'easter was investigated. Simulations were conducted with and without the Coriolis force being evoked in the model, and model results were examined at CBBT, Windmill Pt., and Annapolis, shown in Figure 5.18 through Figure 5.20. It can be seen that the ELCIRC model results compared favorably with the observations in the lower Chesapeake Bay when the Coriolis force was included, indicating the success o f the model in catching the Ekman dynamics. However, when the Coriolis force was not included, the simulated storm tide was notably under-predicted. Sensitivity tests conducted in this section demonstrated that the Ekman transport induced by strong northeast wind has played a major role in pumping water from the continental shelf into the Bay, and as a consequence, causing significant surge and inundation to the coast. The ELCIRC storm surge and inundation simulations in the Chesapeake Bay were conducted for the November 2009 Mid-Atlantic N or'easter. Forecast winds (the NAM wind, the WRF-GFS wind, and the RAMS-GFS wind) were used to drive the hydrodynamic model. The RAMS-GFS wind was found to be the most reliable wind. Comparisons between simulated and observed water levels at 11 NOAA tidal gauge stations suggested that the quality o f storm surge prediction was highly dependent on the quality o f forecast winds. Also, the ensemble forecast approach was proved to be beneficial in reducing model uncertainty. The discrepancy of model results found in the Upper Bay area was investigated as well. Further investigations were conducted, using a fetch-limited wind drag coefficient in the upper Bay rather than using the wind drag coefficient suitable for use in the open ocean. As a result, the water level prediction in the Upper Bay was greatly improved. Inundation simulations were also examined over the Greater Hampton Roads area by comparing to USGS measured flooding records. Model results demonstrated that the ELCIRC model has the ability to handle wetting-and-drying with accuracy and robustness. Sensitivity tests were also conducted in this study to investigate: 1) the feasibility o f ELCIRC to conduct real time ensemble forecast; 2 ) the remote and local wind effects on storm surge predictions; and 3) the influence o f continental shelf dynamics on water level fluctuations inside the Bay. It was found that the ELCIRC model was capable o f a timely and accurate simulation of storm surge inside the Bay using multiple real time forecast winds. It was also found that the remote wind effect played an important role in causing the primary surge to the Bay, while the local wind effect was responsible for the major set-down in the Upper Bay. In short, the Ekman transport is one o f the key mechanisms in affecting the water level fluctuations inside the Bay during a long period o f wind forcing. The major finding and conclusion o f this thesis are summarized as follows: (1) A high-resolution, unstructured grid hydrodynamic model with an efficient solver was developed and successfully applied for storm surge and inundation simulations in the Chesapeake Bay. (2) By coupling a large domain grid with a high-resolution small domain grid, the ELCIRC model had a good performance in simulating storm surge in the Chesapeake Bay and the adjacent continental shelf during the Novem ber 2009 N or'easter. (3) Based on the comparison between ELCIRC model results and NOAA tides /water levels over the entire Chesapeake Bay, the overall RMS is 10 cm, which represents about 5% o f error normalized with the maximum surge. The performance o f the storm tide prediction depends highly on the quality of weather forecasts. The ensemble forecast approach was proved to be effective in reducing uncertainty by driving the ELCIRC model using NAM, high resolution of WRF-GFS and RAMS-GFS atmospheric modeled wind fields. (4) It was found that the surface wind drag coefficient was affected by the fetch-limited condition in the Upper Chesapeake Bay. By implementing the revised empirical surface drag coefficient over that area, the prediction in the Upper Bay was greatly improved. (5) Nine inundation gauge sensors were deployed by the USGS during the November 2009 N or'easter. The inundation simulation compared exceptionally well with those inundation measurements, which provided confidence for the use of the inundation maps for future operational purposes. (6 ) Sensitivity tests were conducted to illustrate the operational real-time forecast, and the important roles played by the remote versus local winds on water level fluctuations inside the Bay. Also, the Ekman transport was proved to be one o f the key mechanisms in affecting the surge inside the Bay during a long period of wind forcing. The prototype o f the Chesapeake Bay storm surge and inundation prediction system developed in this study showed great potential and capability to be established as a real time forecast system in the future. However, more investigations still need be performed. First, although the ELCIRC model has generated satisfying storm surge and inundation simulations for the November 2009 Mid-Atlantic N or'easter, more test cases should be conducted to validate the capability o f the ELCIRC model. Secondly, a wave model should be coupled with the ELCIRC model for better storm surge predictions inside the Bay. Thirdly, with the parallel computing technique being available, ensemble forecast should be further developed for real time forecasting purposes. Last but not least, the wind drag coefficient in the Upper Bay needs to be further investigated for better storm surge prediction."}, {"section_title": "APPENDICES", "text": "Appendix A.
