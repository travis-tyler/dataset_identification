[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Reciprocal relations between weight and psychological factors suggest deep connections between mind and body. Personality traits are linked to weight gain; weight gain may likewise be associated with personality change. Using data from two diverse longitudinal samples (total N=1,919; 10 years average follow-up), we show that significant weight gain is associated with increases in both impulsiveness and deliberation: In both samples, middle-aged adults who gained \u226510% of their baseline body weight by follow-up increased in their tendency to give in to temptation, yet were more thoughtful about the consequences of their actions. The present research moves beyond life events to implicate health status in adult personality development."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "behaving, contribute to abnormal weight (Brummett et al., 2006; Chapman, Fiscella, Duberstein, Coletta, & Kawachi, 2009; Terracciano et al., 2009 ) and weight gain (Magee & Heaven, 2011; Sutin et al., 2011) . For example, high Neuroticism and low Conscientiousness are associated with higher BMI and aspects of impulsivity, including impulsiveness and lack of self-discipline, have been associated with weight gain across adulthood (Sutin et al., 2011) . The direction of this relation is unlikely to be unidirectional. Body weight is, in part, a physical manifestation of an individual's lifestyle and may be a source of information about the individual's personality that could lead to personality change over time. Although previous research found that baseline weight was mostly unrelated to personality development across adulthood (Sutin et al., 2011) , changes in weight, particularly weight gain, may prompt personality change. That is, weight itself may not foster changes in personality but the process of gaining a significant amount of Weight and personality change 4 weight could lead individuals to view themselves differently and to think, feel, and behave differently over time. Weight gain can be a very physical reminder of the inability to control one's impulses, and those who gain weight may come to perceive themselves to be, or to actually become, more impulsive and less disciplined. Further, the stigma associated with weight gain could feed back on to how individuals perceive or describe themselves.\nThe present study tested whether gain of at least 10% of baseline body weight by followup was associated with change in impulsivity-related personality traits, which are among the traits with the strongest theoretical and empirical links with body weight (Davis, 2010) . We hypothesized that those who gained weight would become more impulsive, undisciplined, and less thoughtful because high impulsiveness, low self-discipline and low deliberation have been associated with higher BMI and weight gain (Sutin et al., 2011) . We tested this hypothesis in two longitudinal samples that varied in age and socio-economic status."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Samples", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "BLSA.", "text": "Participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA; N=1, 457) with at least two assessments of personality and weight were selected from the BLSA cohort.\nThis sample was 48% female, 70% White, 23% Black, and 7% other ethnicities. Participants were middle to older age (M=58.74 years at baseline, SD=15.35) and educated (M=17.09 years of education, SD=2.52).\nECA. Participants were drawn from the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) study, a multiwave cohort study of East Baltimore residents (Eaton et al., 1997; Eaton, Kalaydjian, Scharfstein, Mezuk, & Ding, 2007) . Personality in the ECA was available from Wave 3 (referred to as baseline) and Wave 4 (referred to as follow-up; L\u00f6ckenhoff et al., 2008 "}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": "Personality traits. In both samples, personality was assessed with the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R; Costa & McCrae, 1992) . Participants completed it twice, approximately 10 years apart in the BLSA (M=10.58, SD=5.15, range 1-21 years) and approximately 8 years apart in the ECA (M=8.38, SD=2.10; range 4-12 years). We focused primarily on the impulsivity-related facets of the NEO-PI-R: N5: Impulsiveness, E5: ExcitementSeeking, C5: Self-Discipline, and C6: Deliberation. Raw scores were converted to T-scores (M=50, SD=10) using American combined-sex norms (Costa & McCrae, 1992) .\nWeight. Weight and height were either measured by a trained staff clinician (BLSA, ECA follow-up) or self-reported (ECA baseline). Weight gain was calculated as a 10% increase in weight between baseline and follow-up; 16% of BLSA participants and 38% of ECA participants gained at least 10% of their baseline body weight by follow-up."}, {"section_title": "Analysis", "text": "To test whether significant weight gain was associated with change in the impulsivityrelated traits, we regressed personality at follow-up on baseline personality, age, age squared, sex, ethnicity, education, interval between testing, and weight gain (0<10% gain, 1\u226510% gain).\nAdditional analyses controlled for baseline BMI and tested age, sex, ethnicity, education, and baseline BMI as moderators of the weight gain-personality change associations. For comparison, Weight and personality change 6 we also tested whether significant weight loss (\u226510% loss of baseline body weight) was associated with personality change."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Consistent with our hypothesis, weight gain in both samples was associated with change in N5: Impulsiveness: Compared to those who did not gain a significant amount of weight, those who gained greater than 10% of their body weight between baseline and follow-up increased in their tendency to give in to temptations (\u03b2s=.06 and .11, ps<.01 for BLSA and ECA, respectively). Those who did not gain weight showed the typical normative decline (~1 T-score over a decade) in impulsivity, whereas those who gained weight increased in impulsiveness (~1 T-score point) between baseline and follow-up (Figure 1 ). Surprisingly and counter to our hypothesis, weight gain was also associated with increases in C6: Deliberation in both samples:\nThose who gained weight increased in their tendency to think before acting (\u03b2s=.05 and .09,ps<.05 for BLSA and ECA, respectively; Figure 2 ). Participants who gained weight had more than double the increase in C6: Deliberation than participants with stable weight (an increase of ~2 T-score points versus ~1 T-score point). Weight gain was not associated with changes in either E5: Excitement-Seeking (\u03b2s=.02 and -.01, ns, for BLSA and ECA, respectively) or C5: Self-Discipline (both \u03b2s=.00, ns, for BLSA and ECA). Results were similar when weight gain was entered as a continuous, rather than dichotomous, variable and when increases in BMI were used instead of increases in weight. Controlling for baseline BMI did not alter the results, nor were there any interactions between baseline BMI and weight gain on changes in personality. The supplementary table shows the associations between weight gain and change in the five broad dimensions of personality. There was a small effect of weight gain on increases in Conscientiousness in the BLSA, which was due to the association between weight Weight and personality change 7 gain and increases in C6: Deliberation. Weight gain was unrelated to change in any of the other personality traits.\nWe next tested whether demographic factors moderated any of these associations. In the BLSA, the increase in C6: Deliberation among those who gained weight was mainly due to younger participants (\u03b2 interaction =-.06, p<.05). Age did not moderate this association in the ECA (\u03b2 interaction =.02, ns), which is consistent with the BLSA in that ECA participants were younger and this effect was only apparent among the young to middle aged in the BLSA. Sex, ethnicity, and education did not moderate this association in either sample and none of the demographic factors moderated the association between weight gain and change in the other three traits.\nIn contrast to weight gain, weight loss was not consistently associated with personality change. Those who lost at least 10% of their baseline weight (~7% of participants in each sample) decreased in N5: Impulsiveness in the ECA (\u03b2=-.14, p<.05), but weight loss was unrelated to changes in this trait in the BLSA (\u03b2=-.01, ns). Weight loss was associated with a decrease in C6: Deliberation in the BLSA (\u03b2 =-.04, p<.05) but was unrelated to changes in this trait in the ECA (\u03b2=.04, ns). Weight loss was unrelated to either E5: Excitement-Seeking (\u03b2s=-.01 and .04, ns, respectively for BLSA and ECA) or C5: Self-Discipline (\u03b2s=.00 and .06, ns, respectively for BLSA and ECA)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Across two samples that varied in age and socio-economic status, significant weight gain was associated with increases in both impulsiveness and deliberation. That is, those who gained at least 10% of their baseline body weight described themselves as more likely to give in to temptations, but also as more thoughtful. Although seemingly modest, these changes are nonetheless substantively meaningful. For example, at follow-up, there was a difference of ~2 TWeight and personality change 8 score points in impulsiveness between those who gained weight and those who did not. This translates into roughly 1/5 of a SD increase in impulsiveness over one decade, which is larger than the expected decrease in this trait that occurs with normal aging (Terracciano et al., 2005) .\nThe effect sizes are also of similar magnitude to the correlation between life events and personality change, such as starting a new job and increases in Conscientiousness (L\u00fcdtke, Roberts, Trautwein, & Nagy, 2011) , and to the effect of personality on consequential life outcomes, including weight gain (Sutin et al., 2011) and longevity (Roberts, Kuncel, Shiner, Caspi, & Goldberg, 2007) .\nImpulsivity-related traits have been associated with weight and weight gain in previous studies (Sutin et al., 2011) , but weight gain did not have an equal association with change in these traits over time in the present study. Several mechanisms, both psychological and physiological, may lead from weight gain to personality change. There is a pervasive stereotype in American society that overweight and obese individuals are lazy, weak-willed, undisciplined, and struggle with willpower (Puhl & Heuer, 2010) . As individuals gain weight, they may internalize these stereotypes and come to view their personalities as consistent with such impressions of the obese. Although they viewed themselves as more impulsive, participants who gained weight in our two samples did not come to resemble other aspects of the stereotype.\nWeight gain, for example, was unrelated to changes in self-discipline and was related to an increase, not decrease, in deliberation.\nA second possibility is that physiological mechanisms associated with weight gain could contribute to the relation between weight gain and changes in personality. For example, overweight and obese individuals tend to have higher levels of inflammation (Visser, Bouter, McQuillan, Wener, & Harris, 1999) , and chronic inflammation may reduce the ability to Weight and personality change 9 effectively regulate emotions and control behavior (Miller, Capuron, & Raison, 2005) . The increase in both impulsiveness and deliberation, replicated across two diverse samples, suggests that weight gain could be associated with detrimental psychophysiological effects on the emotional component of impulsivity (i.e., giving in to urges, inability to resist cravings), and that failure to control behavior could also raise awareness of the consequences associated with those behaviors. Likewise, preliminary evidence indicates that there are psychological changes that accompany bariatric surgery (J\u00e4rvholm et al., 2012) , which further suggests that physiological changes in the body are associated with psychological changes.\nSignificant weight gain can hardly go unnoticed by friends and family, and feedback from close others may heighten attention to eating behavior. For example, overweight and obese individuals most often cite friends and parents as the source of weight stigmatization (Puhl, Moss-Racusin, Schwartz, & Brownell, 2008) and such stigmatization may bring greater awareness to how much the individual is eating. A close other may be more likely to make an offhand comment about a second helping at dinner to someone in the midst of weight gain than to someone whose weight is stable. This heightened attention may be associated with an increased tendency to think before acting, even if those thoughts do not translate into planned and effective behaviors. Increases in deliberation may reflect the rationalization that often accompanies unhealthy eating behaviors (Kemp, Bui, & Grier, 2011) .\nThe present research has implications for adult personality development. Research on personality change in adulthood typically focuses on its normative trajectory (Terracciano, McCrae, Brant, & Costa, 2005) and how life events potentially alter this path (Specht, Egloff, & Schmukle, 2011) . The present research indicates that physical changes in the body are also associated with the trajectory of personality over time. Notably, our findings both push against Weight and personality change 10 and amplify normative changes in impulsivity-related traits. The normative trajectory of N5:\nImpulsiveness is a clear linear decline with age, but significant weight gain pushes against this developmental trend. As people gain weight, they may become more impulsive, perhaps because weight gain is very physical evidence of the failure to control cravings. In contrast to impulsiveness, C6: Deliberation tends to increase for everyone across adulthood, but weight gain may amplify this normative age-related trend.\nThe present research suggests a potential downward spiral for those struggling with their weight. The impulsiveness aspect of Neuroticism is the strongest personality trait contributor to weight gain (Sutin et al., 2011) , and our current findings suggest that weight gain is associated with increases in this trait. The inability to control cravings may reinforce a vicious cycle that weakens the self-control muscle (Baumeister, Vohs, & Tice, 2007) : Yielding to temptation today may reduce the ability (self-control/will-power) to resist cravings tomorrow. Thus, individuals who gain weight may be at greater risk for additional weight gain through changes in their personality.\nThis research had several strengths, including two large independent longitudinal samples that varied in age and socio-economic status, a well-established measure of personality traits, and two assessments of weight and personality over a significant period of time. We could not, however, distinguish between actual personality change and changes in self-perception of personality. Future research would benefit from additional personality measures, such as observer reports, which could help to disentangle these types of change. Future research could also explore the mechanisms that contribute to these effects and how consideration of an individual's personality may improve intervention effectiveness. For example, weight-loss interventions that focus primarily on providing information about healthy lifestyle choices may Weight and personality change 11 be less effective than those aimed at the emotional aspects of impulsivity. In addition, with correlational data in the present study, we could not disentangle the direction of the relation between weight gain and changes in personality or if a third variable is responsible for the observed associations. Future research would thus benefit from more than two assessments of personality and weight to test hypotheses about the temporal relations between the two. Overall, our findings suggest that even when individuals think about the consequences of their actions, their emotional impulses might be too hard to overcome. "}]
