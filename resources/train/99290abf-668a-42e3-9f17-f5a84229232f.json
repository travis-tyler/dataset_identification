[{"section_title": "", "text": "Our research extends prior studies in several important ways. Prior studies have generally examined one or two developmental domains, but we examined three domains (cognition, behavior, and health) using similar methods and a common sample from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B). Across these outcomes, we also tested whether associations between the type of care and child outcomes were moderated by the time spent in care and mediated by the quality of care, both overall and within developmental domains, using the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale-Revised Edition (ECERS-R; Harms, Clifford, & Dyer, 1998), Family Day Care Rating Scale (FDCRS; Harms & Clifford, 1989), and Arnett Caregiver Interaction Scale (Arnett CIS;Arnett, 1989). To our knowledge, our study is the first to examine mediation by aligned quality measures. This contribution is notable because previous studies have typically adjusted for broad aspects of quality rather than quality specific to the outcome domain (Loeb, Fuller, Kagan, & Carrol, 2004;NICHD Early Care Child Research Network, 2004;NICHD Early Care Child Research Network & Duncan, 2003;Votruba-Drzal, Coley, & Chase-Lansdale, 2004). Other researchers have noted limitations with broad measures of quality, specifically that they are not adequately aligned with outcomes (Lamb, 2000;Layzer & Goodson, 2006;Vandell & Wolfe, 2000;Zaslow et al., 2006). In our study, we used subscale scores, which are presumed to better align with different aspects of child development than total scores. The potential importance of better aligning quality with developmental outcomes is suggested by intervention studies that showed, for example, that child literacy could be raised by caregivers' greater language stimulation (Dickinson & Caswell, 2007;Wasik, Bond, & Hindman, 2006). Consistent with this evidence, we hypothesized that better aligned quality measures might reveal larger associations with child outcomes than those found in prior studies that relied on global measures of quality. On the other hand, recent psychometric evidence suggests that even subscales, such as those we used, may be less aligned with outcomes than previously thought, because more finely grained analyses have shown that items in these subscales actually mix various aspects of quality (Clifford, Sideris, Neitzel, & Abuchaim, 2012;. For example, instructions for the ECERS-R/FDCRS require observers rating personal care items to attend not only to health constructs but also to whether the teacher sat with and engaged in conversations with children during meals. This study extends these recent critiques of quality measures because we examined whether the subscale scores sometimes presumed to be better align with child outcomes are indeed better mediators of the association between child care type and child development than are nonaligned measures."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "A large literature has examined associations between child care and outcomes, and we highlight the prior research that is of greatest relevance for our study. It is important to note that numerous studies have reported that, compared to children cared for in homes, children in centers score higher on cognitive assessments and lower on socioemotional assessments, but effect sizes are modest (Dmitrieva, Steinberg, & Belsky, 2007;Loeb, Bridges, Bassok, Fuller, & Rumberger, 2007). Studies using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) have reported associations between centers and cognitive assessments (ECLS-K reading and math scores) of 0.10 to 0.30 SD (Loeb et al., 2007;Magnuson et al., 2004;Magnuson, Ruhm, & Waldfogel, 2007). Studies have also documented more behavioral and self-control problems among children in center care for long hours with small to modest effect sizes in samples drawn from the ECLS-K (Dmitrieva et al., 2007;Loeb et al., 2007;Magnuson et al., 2007) and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (NICHD SECCYD;Belsky et al., 2007;NICHD Early Care Child Research Network, 2002. Finally, studies have reported that children cared for in centers are more likely to catch illnesses such as the flu and develop ear infections than children cared for in homes (Haskins & Kotch, 1986;Rovers, Zielhuis, Ingels, & van der Wilt, 1999). Second, researchers have documented significant correlations between developmental outcomes and the number of hours per week that children spend in care, especially large group care (Belsky, 2002;NICHD Early Care Child Research Network, 2007). For example, Loeb et al. (2007) found that children in centers for more than 30 hours per week gain more in pre-reading skills, but have worse behavior, than children in care part time. Belsky (2002) reported that children averaging 30 hours/week in child care (vs. fewer than 10) have greater externalizing problems (effect size of .38). Later analyses of the same data (NICHD SECCYD) revealed that the elevated behavior problems associated with more time in care are specific to centers (NICHD Early Care Child Research Network, 2007). Studies have also shown that long hours in centers, but not in homes, increase respiratory problems and ear infections (Gordon, Kaestner, & Korenman, 2007). Our examination of the potential mediating role of quality was informed by small effect sizes found in child care quality studies (Burchinal, Kainz, & Cai, 2011;Keys et al., 2013). Burchinal and colleagues' (2011) recent meta-analysis comprehensively synthesized results from 20 different published studies that used a wide range of global measures, including the ECERS, the NICHD SECCYD's Observational Record of the Caregiving Environment, and composites, adding additional measures such as the Arnett CIS; the authors concluded that the association of higher global quality with higher cognition and fewer behavior problems is small (average effect size of .11). Poor alignment between aspects of quality and domains of child development may partly explain the small effect sizes. For example, higher average cognition among children cared for in centers (vs. homes) may reflect a better quality of centers with respect to learning; overall quality may be an imperfect signal of this specific aspect. Few studies have aligned quality measures with child outcomes, although a notable exception using the NICHD SECCYD demonstrated that language stimulation is more strongly associated with cognition (i.e., language comprehension, applied problem solving; NICHD Early Care Child Research Network, 2003) than the composite measure. Burchinal and colleagues conducted new analyses to test for the possibility that aligned quality subscales from the ECERS and Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS; Pianta, La Paro, & Hamre, 2008) are more strongly associated with child outcomes than global quality (using different data sources than we did in the current study). They found that the ECERS Language-Reasoning and Interaction subscales and CLASS Instructional and Emotional Support subscales had more consistent, yet still modest, partial correlations with children's language, reading, math, social skills, and behavioral problems than did composite quality (some aligned correlations were as high as .19, with 19% of correlations at .10 or above, as opposed to global correlations, which had a high of .24, but only 13% of correlations were at .10 or above; Burchinal et al., 2011). A few studies have examined whether quality mediates associations between the type of care and outcomes but relied on global rather than aligned measures (Loeb et al., 2004;NICHD Early Care Child Research Network, 2004;NICHD Early Care Child Research Network & Duncan, 2003;Schwebel, Brezausek, & Belsky, 2006). For example, Schwebel and colleagues (2006) studied the mediating role of the NICHD SECCYD composite quality measure on child injury rates; the association was not significant, but they did not examine the role of supervision or other specific aspects of quality that potentially could be more closely associated with injuries. Building on these earlier analyses, we examined whether aligned quality mediates the relationship between type of care and outcomes using the subscale scores of the ECERS-R/ FDCRS. We also tested for another previously unexamined possibility: moderated mediation, which would imply that the mediating effect of quality is greatest for children in care for the most hours (Preacher, Rucker, & Hayes, 2007)."}, {"section_title": "Hypotheses", "text": "As our brief review suggests, much of the literature has focused on overall associations between child outcomes and child care type, intensity, and quality. Less frequently examined are whether quality mediates associations between child care type and outcomes, and whether intensity of care moderates these associations. We examined these possibilities using the ECLS-B. It is important to note that we considered child outcomes across the cognitive, socioemotional, and health domains, and we attempted to align aspects of quality with these domains to examine the following hypotheses:"}, {"section_title": "Hypothesis 1", "text": "Children will have better cognitive outcomes, but poorer behavior and health outcomes, on average, when they are cared for in center-based versus home-based settings."}, {"section_title": "Hypothesis 2", "text": "Associations between type of care and outcomes will be larger for children who spend more hours in care.

The age range in our analytic sample was 44 to 64 months. We selected the 4-year follow-up because at this age many children are in child care of both types (centers and homes). In initial analyses, we replicated the association between type of care and outcomes in the full sample, including children in exclusive parental care; results are available on request. The ECLS-B initially sampled newborns from vital statistics birth records in 46 states for the year 2001. The sample size was 10,700 at the initial 9-month interview (response rate of 74%) and 8,950 at the 4-year follow-up. (We rounded sample sizes to the nearest 50 to conform to the ECLS-B restricted-use requirements). We used data from the portion of the study at which the setting was observed for quality. To reduce costs, the investigators randomly selected a subsample of 1,550 four-year olds who had been randomly selected from children in care 10 or more hours per week, with oversampling based on child poverty and type of care (home based, Head Start, and non-Head Start centers; Snow et al., 2007, p. 127). All children observed in child care at age 2 and still in care for at least 10 hours at age 4 were also included in the observation sample . We imposed no further selection criteria. We lost approximately 6% of cases due to item-level missing data. Our analytic sample sizes ranged from 1,500 to 1,550, depending on item-level missing data for each outcome. We used sampling weights that ECLS-B statisticians created to adjust for the initial and subsequent (for the child care observation) oversampling, initial nonresponse, and differential nonresponse over time (including participation rates for child care providers). Analyses also adjusted for the study's primary sampling units."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": "Child developmental outcomes-We constructed all child outcome measures so that higher values indicated more desirable developmental outcomes (e.g., a higher behavior score indicated less problematic behavior). We used two cognitive achievement scores created by ECLS-B staff for reading and math achievement (Najarian, Snow, Lennon, & Kinsey, 2010;Snow et al., , 2009. We did this because the ECLS-B drew items from a variety of sources rather than using all items from a single standardized measure, and the individual items were not publically released. The reading composite score is a measure of emergent early literacy, including letter sounds, early reading, phonological awareness, knowledge of print conventions, and matching words (Snow et al., , 2009. The mathematics composite score measures number sense, geometry, counting, operations, and patterns (Najarian et al., 2010;Snow et al., , 2009. We created socioemotional measures from caregiver-and parent-reported items the ECLS-B selected from the Preschool and Kindergarten Behavior Scales-Second Edition (Merrell, 2003), the Social Skills Rating System (Gresham & Elliott, 1990), and the ECLS-K cohort survey . Because the ECLS-B did not provide psychometrically constructed subscales for the socioemotional items (Najarian et al., 2010), we generated subscales based on confirmatory factor analyses and item response theory models . Our analyses yielded three scales that we refer to as (a) social competence (e.g., how well the child plays with others, is liked by others, is accepted by others), (b) emotional and behavioral regulation (e.g., lack of aggression, anger, and worry; expressions of happiness), and (c) attention and concentration (e.g., pays attention well, does not disrupt class, is not overly active). With regard to health outcomes, we created a dummy indicator from the parent's overall rating of the child's health: excellent or very good (1), or good, fair, or poor (0), a common specification in the health literature (Case, Lubotsky, & Paxson, 2001;Case & Paxson, 2006;Newacheck, Hung, Park, Brindis, & Irwin, 2003). We also created dummy variables to indicate the absence of illness or injury based on parents' reports of whether the child had a doctor-confirmed respiratory illness, gastrointestinal flu, ear infection, or injury since the last interview. Child care type and intensity-Providers reported the type of care at the preschool wave. Home care was defined as nonparental care by a relative (grandparents, brother, sisters, or any other relatives) or nonrelative (family child care providers, regular sitters, or neighbors). Center care included day care centers, nursery schools, preschools, or prekindergarten programs. To facilitate interpretation, we trichotomized hours in care into 15 hours or less, 16 to 34 hours, and 35 or more hours per week, based on prior studies that have shown that associations between child outcomes and hours in care were nonlinear (especially for many hours in care; i.e., Loeb et al., 2007;Magnuson et al., 2004) and to reflect approximate tertiles in the sample. In sensitivity analyses, we found a similar pattern of results using a continuous-hours measure (results available on request). Child care quality-Observers completed the ECERS-R, FDCRS, and Arnett CIS as part of the ECLS-B child care observation at the preschool wave (Arnett, 1989;Harms & Clifford, 1989;Harms et al., 1998;. In addition to total scores, we used subscale scores aligned as closely as possible with outcome domains. Raters scored the ECERS-R and FDCRS items on a scale that ranged from 1 (inadequate) to 7 (excellent) based on numerous indicators. Although the format of the two scales is similar, they differ in the number and content of items. The ECERS-R has 43 items (37 of which were included in the ECLS-B), and the FDCRS has 40 items (33 of which were included in the ECLS-B). Each scale includes items about space and furnishings, personal care routines, language, learning activities, and social interactions. Following standard practice, ECLS-B staff calculated total scores by averaging the ECERS-R or FDCRS items. The Arnett CIS includes 26 items focused on the quality of the caregiver's interactions with the children. Modeled on four well-established parenting styles (authoritarian, authoritative, permissive, and uninvolved; Arnett, 1989;Maccoby & Martin, 1983), the items encompass the caregivers' warmth, enthusiasm, involvement, and interest in the children as well as the extent of their hostility, criticism, and laxness. Items are scored on a scale of 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much). ECLS-B staff created a total score by summing items after reverse scoring negatively oriented items. Arnett CIS content and scoring are the same in centers and homes. In an effort to better align aspects of quality with child outcomes, we selected ECERS-R and FDCRS subscales. For cognitive outcomes, we used the Language-Reasoning subscales, which cover constructs such as having a wide selection of books and the caregiver helping children learn concepts of size, shape, and number. For socioemotional outcomes, we used the ECERS-R Interaction and FDCRS Social Development subscales to capture supervision, discipline, and interactions between staff and children. For health outcomes, the ECERS-R Personal Care and FDCRS Basic Care subscales encompass mealtime sanitation and safety, nap or rest time, and toileting/diapering. To simplify interpretation and to allow for possible threshold effects (Burchinal et al., 2011), we classified quality into approximate tertiles of the distribution (low, medium, and high), separately for the total and subscale score. (Table  1 includes the thresholds for each specification). We did not include the Arnett CIS in aligned quality because it is plausibly associated with each domain, not only in socioemotional outcomes (social development, child aggression, and lack of negative affect) but also in complexity of child play and academic achievement (Brown & Iyengar, 2008;Downer, Sabol, & Hamre, 2010;Lagac\u00e9-S\u00e9guin & d'Entremont, 2006;Underwood, Beron, Gentsch, Galperin, & Risser, 2008). Other covariates-We used several covariates to address nonrandom selection into child care (Blau, 1999;Duncan & Gibson-Davis, 2006;NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 2004) including the mother's education, employment status, marital status, health status, and age, as well as the family's income relative to the federal poverty level. We controlled for child characteristics such as race, gender, age (in months), low birth weight, and whether the child was ever breast fed. To adjust for unmeasured child-specific factors that may be correlated with both type of care and developmental outcomes, we included lagged (Age 2) cognition, social skills, and health status: the Bayley Short Form-Research Edition mental health, motor, and behavior scores (National Center for Education Statistics, 2001); whether the child had a doctor-confirmed respiratory illness, gastrointestinal flu, ear infection, or injury; an assessment of the child's temperament (measured with the Infant/ Toddler Symptom Checklist; DeGangi, Poisson, Sickel, & Wiener, 1995); and the child's overall health, reported by the mother. We controlled for the geographic region or state of residence (if the sample included 25 or more cases from the state), whether the family resided in an urban area, and whether the mother was the respondent in the parent interview (99% of cases). The weighted descriptive statistics for all covariates are presented in Table  1."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Approach", "text": "We started our empirical analyses with regression models similar to those found in the literature. To test Hypothesis 1, we regressed a measure of child development at age 4 onto a dummy indicator for whether the child was cared for in a center (vs. a home) at age 4, adjusting for Age 2 lagged outcomes and family and child characteristics, including hours spent in care at age 4 (Model 1). We used weighted least squares regression models for all outcomes. For the dichotomous health outcomes, these were linear probability models, which simplified interpretation (Wooldridge, 2009). We verified the pattern of significant results with logit specifications (available on request). To test Hypothesis 2-whether intensity moderates associations between the type of care and developmental outcomes-we added interactions between hours in care and type of care. Specifically, two dummy indicators of (a) 35 or more hours per week and (b) 16 to 34 hours per week (vs. 15 hours or less) were interacted with the dummy indicator of center care (Model 2). We used F statistics to test whether the two interactions were jointly significant. To assess Hypothesis 3-whether child care quality mediates associations between center care and outcomes-we added to Model 1 dummy indicators for medium and high (vs. low) quality on the ECERS-R/FDCRS and Arnett CIS total scores (Model 3). If child care quality mediates associations between type of care and outcomes, estimates of associations between center care and child outcomes from Model 3 should be smaller (closer to 0) than corresponding estimates from Model 1. We conducted a formal test of the significance of the mediation effects using the PRODCLIN program (MacKinnon, Fritz, Williams, & Lockwood, 2007). We include results from the formal test of mediation in Online Appendix A, which is available on the Journal of Marriage and Family website, http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1741-3737). Because the ECERS-R/ FDCRS and Arnett CIS measures were correlated, we used F statistics to jointly test whether the set of dummy variables indicating moderate or high quality on each measure explained significant variation in each outcome. Model 4 tested for moderated mediation by adding interactions to Model 3 between the dummy indicators of medium and high hours per week in care and the dummy indicators of medium and high quality on the ECERS-R/FDCRS and Arnett CIS to test whether mediation through quality is greater for children in care more hours per week. We used F statistics for the set of interaction terms to test Hypothesis 4. To test Hypothesis 5 (mediation when quality is better aligned with outcomes), we reestimated Models 3 and 4 but substituted for total quality a set of dummy indicators of the ECERS-R/FDCRS quality subscales that were better aligned with each outcome. We used F statistics for the dummy indicators of medium and high (vs. low) subscale quality (Model 5) and the sets of interactions (Model 6) to test Hypothesis 5. We used the PRODCLIN program to formally test the significance of mediation effects through aligned quality. Table 2 includes results from Model 1 and Model 3. Estimates of associations between child care type and outcomes (Model 1) are presented in the top panel of Table 2. Consistent with Hypothesis 1, 4-year-olds in center care averaged higher math and reading scores than children cared for in homes; center care was associated with a 0.14-unit increase in the math score and a 0.16-unit increase in the reading score, adjusting for covariates including lagged child outcomes. Both estimates were statistically significant and represented approximately 0.2 SD of the dependent variables, similar to effects reported in previous studies (e.g., Loeb et al., 2007). Estimates of the association between type of care and socioemotional outcomes were mixed, with some results consistent with our expectations, some not, and differences between caregivers and parent reports. As expected, center teachers reported that children in their care demonstrated less skillful social interactions than did home-based caregivers; however, center teachers also rated children's emotional and behavioral regulation better than did home-based caregivers, contrary to Hypothesis 1. Effects for both of these caregiver-reported socioemotional outcomes represented approximately 0.3-SD differences for the dependent variables. In contrast, when parents' reports were used to construct the dependent variables (results available on request), attention and concentration scores were higher for children in center care than in home care (about 0.15 SD). This parent-reported result is also in the opposite direction of our expectations. Regarding health outcomes, estimates indicated that, with one exception, center care was negatively associated with health (as expected), but only one of the estimates was statistically significant (ear infections), and all associations were small (less than 10% of the mean). In short, Hypothesis 1 was partially confirmed, with the most consistent evidence for the cognitive advantage of attending center-based care."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Hypotheses 1 and 2: Replicating Associations Between Type/Intensity and Child Outcomes", "text": "We do not present results for Model 2 because only one of the 20 interactions between hours and type of care was significant (results available on request). Thus, Hypothesis 2 was not confirmed: Hours in care does not appear to moderate the association between type of care and outcomes for preschoolers in the ECLS-B."}, {"section_title": "Hypotheses 3 and 4: Mediation Through Total Scores of Child Care Quality", "text": "We next assessed whether the quality of child care mediated associations between center care and child outcomes. Estimates from Model 3, presented in the bottom panel of Table 2, suggested two main conclusions. First, a comparison of estimates of associations between center care and child outcomes in the top and bottom panels of Table 2 suggests that quality of care, as measured by the ECERS-R/FDCRS and Arnett CIS, generally did not mediate the associations between center care and child outcomes. The five significant associations in the top panel remained significant in the bottom panel, and four were unexpectedly larger in magnitude in the bottom versus the top panel. Our formal tests of mediation confirmed these results: Only four of 40 tests were statistically significant (details available on request). Reading was the only outcome with a significant mediation test in the expected direction (the coefficient was 13% smaller in Model 3 than Model 1). The modest level of mediation is reflected in the fact that measures of quality were, for the majority of cases, not significantly related to outcomes: All but one of our F tests did not reject the null hypothesis that there is no association between quality and outcomes. (The exception was that children in middle-vs. low-quality settings on the ECERS-R/FDCRS were more likely to be free from ear infections.) F tests showed that associations between quality and parents' reports of socioemotional outcomes were also not statistically significant (results available on request). Thus, Hypothesis 3 was generally not confirmed: There is little evidence that total child care quality mediates the association between type of care and child outcomes, the exception being children's reading scores. We next considered whether associations between child outcomes and quality are moderated by hours in care. Doing so allowed us to investigate whether the apparent lack of mediation found in Model 3 resulted from constraining the association between quality and outcomes to be the same no matter how many hours a child is in care (no moderated mediation). Estimates related to Hypothesis 4 are included in Online Appendix B on the Journal of Marriage and Family website. The F tests indicated that it is not possible to reject the null hypothesis of no relationship between hours and type of care. Thus, Hypothesis 4 was not confirmed: We did not find evidence of moderated mediation (the association between total child care quality and child outcomes does not appear to depend on hours spent in care)."}, {"section_title": "Hypothesis 5: Mediation Through Better Aligned Measures of Child Care Quality", "text": "Estimates of Model 5, which uses subscales of quality aligned with child outcomes, are presented in Table 3. For cognitive outcomes, the quality of child care, as measured by the Language-Reasoning subscale of the ECERS-R/FDCRS, was positively and significantly associated with reading achievement, as indicated by the significant F test. Both dummy indicators were individually significant, indicating that children in child care settings of middle and of high quality have higher reading scores than children in low-quality child care settings. The contrast between average math scores for children in settings of middle versus low quality was also statistically significant, but the contrast for children in high-versus low-quality settings was not, and the F statistic was not significant. Of note is that the addition of the aligned measures of quality demonstrated a slight mediating effect on associations between center care and math and reading achievement (the coefficients were 15% and 21% smaller in Table 3 than in Table 2, respectively, for math and reading). Our formal test of mediation confirmed significant mediation for both outcomes (mediation through both middle and high vs. low quality for reading; mediation through middle to low quality for math). In contrast, results reported in the remaining columns of Table 3 reveal that none of the F tests were statistically significant for the aligned subscale scores in predicting children's socioemotional and health outcomes, and formal tests of mediation were also not significant for these outcomes. Our final set of results (Model 6; results available on request) revealed that there was little evidence of moderated mediation. Only six of the 40 interactions between intensity and aligned quality were significant; joint hypothesis tests for sets of interactions were significant for only two of the 10 outcomes; and graphs of the significant interactions were not consistent with conceptual expectations, suggesting that they should be interpreted with caution (among children in care at moderate intensity levels [16-34 hours/week], higher quality was unexpectedly associated with poorer attention/concentration and more respiratory illness). Most important to the focal interest of our study, the coefficients for center care were nearly identical for the outcomes with significant interactions in Model 6 as they were in Model 1 (for attention/concentration, .136 and .137, respectively; for lack of respiratory illness, \u2212.038 and \u2212.034, respectively)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "We extended prior research concerned with the relationship between child care type and child development by examining whether child care quality is a mediating factor and whether the extent of mediation, if any, differs by whether quality is measured by global or more aligned measures. Like previous research, children in our sample who were cared for in centers had higher cognitive achievement than children cared for in homes (Dmitrieva et al., 2007;Loeb et al., 2007). This association was partially mediated by aligned quality subscales specific to language and reasoning. Thus, some of the center advantage appears to be linked to centers' better support of children's language and reasoning skills compared to home-based child care. This finding suggests that efforts to improve support in home-based care for children's language and reasoning skills might reduce the disadvantage for children enrolled in such care. It is important to note that the aligned quality measure of language/reasoning explained only a modest amount of the cognitive advantage associated with centers, however. We highlight two possible explanations for this result. The first explanation is that our measures of quality may not have been sufficiently aligned to this outcome and thus may have missed aspects of quality relevant for cognition. Given that quality (as measured by the ECERS-R/FDCRS and the Arnett CIS in the ECLS-B) is largely not predictive of child outcomes, our evidence supports recent concerns regarding measurement problems in child care quality measures (Clifford et al., 2012;Zaslow, Martinez-Bock, Tout, & Halle, 2011). Zaslow et al. (2011) suggested that associations between child care quality and developmental outcomes might be stronger with more psychometrically sound measures of quality. Although the ECERS-R/FDCRS subscales we used as measures of aligned quality may be an improvement over total scores, recent research raises concerns about the psychometric properties and validity of the ECERS-R subscales as well as the ECERS-R total score . Improved measures of quality may be more strongly associated with child outcomes and therefore be stronger mediators of associations between child care type and outcomes. One measure that researchers are increasingly turning to is the CLASS, but it was not used in the ECLS-B. Our outcome data also provided information about only one child in each care setting, whereas our quality measures assessed materials, activities, and interactions at the classroom level. Ideally future studies would also better align the level of assessment of quality and outcomes. The second explanation is that, despite our adjustment for numerous potentially confounding factors-including lagged measures of child development-the effect of setting type may continue to be attributed in part to the selection into centers of more cognitively advantaged children. In short, the ECLS-B's strength is its nationally representative frame. An important weakness is that its observational design does not allow for causal estimates. Future studies might exploit experiments or quasi-experiments (e.g., from policy changes) that sort children into care settings exogenously in order to better identify causal impacts of center care (e.g., Levine & Zimmerman, 2010). In addition, it is important to note that our findings generally do not confirm the center behavioral and health disadvantages identified in prior research (e.g., Dmitrieva et al., 2007;Haskins & Kotch, 1986;Loeb et al., 2007;Magnuson et al., 2007;Rovers et al., 1999). Our findings for health are in the expected direction, but generally nonsignificant, which might be explained by our focus on 4-year-olds given prior research showing the largest health detriments of large group care for infants and toddlers (Haskins & Kotch, 1986). Our findings for socioemotional outcomes are harder to explain. Some results are consistent with prior research (poorer social competence for children in centers; Dmitrieva et al., 2007;Loeb et al., 2007), but others are not (better attention and regulation of children in centers). One explanation is that the short form socioemotional battery developed for the ECLS-B may be less reliable and valid than the full versions used in prior studies such as the NICHD SECCYD. Whatever the explanation, our results reinforce calls to improve the reliability and validity of social and behavioral development measures for use in child care research (Zaslow et al., 2006). In sum, we found evidence for a cognitive advantage associated with center care for preschoolers, an advantage that was evident for children who attend centers part and full time, and robust to numerous controls, including lagged development.
