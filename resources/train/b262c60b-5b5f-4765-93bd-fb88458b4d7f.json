[{"section_title": "Commissioner's Statement", "text": "This is the fourth periodic report on the programs and plans of the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). When the nation's governors and the President established the six national education goals 4 years ago, a special challenge emerged for NCES. That challenge is to collect and analyze data that can accurately track the growth and change in our national learning experience. That challenge has been expanded with the enactment of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act that added two more education goals to the previous six. As various groups voice their desires and concerns about our schools, NCES continually seeks to define efficient and effective measures that can meet the demands for timely, useful information and yet maintain high statistical standards. At the same time, the interest in data about new topics has not lessened the need for basic statistical information about educational institutions and trends. This report describes the Center's current programs for meeting these needs, its future plans, and its major publications. In addition to updating the descriptions of our traditional standard data collections, such as the Common Core of Data (CCD) and the Integrated Meanwhile, the Center continues to move ahead in collecting detailed cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of students, teachers, and schools in both the elementary/secondary and postsecondary sectors. We have highlighted the availability of many more of our data sets on CD-ROM, including the CCD and IPOS data bases, as well as the Second Student Follow-up and the Second Dropout Follow-up data files of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88). Together with advanced software packages that allow users to customize their search requests, these new electronic data retrieval systems will greatly enhance user access and cost efficiency. The ck -Act people for each major study described are included. Should you have questions, these staff members would be pleased to explain the information in more detail. I invite you to send us comments on how we can make future editions of this book even more useful."}, {"section_title": "Emerson J. Elliott Commissioner of Education Statistics 1 Introduction", "text": "The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) collects statistics on the condition of education in the United States, analyzes and reports the meaning and significance of these statistics, and assists states and local education agencies in improving their statistical systems. NCES supports a wide range of activities. It provides policy-relevant data on issues such as access of minorities to postsecondary education and the impact of enrollment changes on institutions and the outcomes of education. NCES also provides current data on vocational education, and it produces longitudinal data on various cohorts of students from elementary through postsecondary education and into the work force. The Center's programs are directed toward: (1) Maintaining and analyzing the following major cross-sectional databases: at the elementary-secondary levelthe Common Core of Data, the Schools and Staffing Survey. and the Private School Survey; and, at the postsecondary levelthe Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, the Recent College Graduates Study, the National Survey of Postsecondary Faculty, and the Survey of Earned Doctorates Awarded in the United States. In addition, a new, wide-ranging study, the National Household Education Survey, was conducted in 1991 and 1993 with additional surveys planned for the future. It contains information on all levels of education from preschool to postsecondary. These data bases are the principal sources for the Center's most widely used publicationsThe Condition of Education, Digest of Education Statistics, and Projections of Education Statistics. (2) Producing and analyzing data from the Center's longitudinal studies: these include the National Longitudinal Study of 1972, the High School and Beyond Study, and the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 which began with cohorts in secondary school. These studies address differences in student achievement, effects of financial aid on access to postsecondary education, youth employment, high school dropouts, discipline and order, and the quality of education in public and private schools. A hew longitudinal study, Beginning Postsecondary Student Longitudinal Study (BPS), has been initiated and is the first attempt by NCES to produce longitudinal data beginning with students first entering postsecondary education. Another proposed longitudinal study, Baccalaureate and Beyond, was implemented in 1993. It will follow a cohort of students who are near graduation into the work force or further educational endeavors."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": "(3) Coordinating the National Assessment of Educational Progress which assesses academic achievement in a number of domains.

The organization of this publication is systematic. Each chapter contains a brief introduction; a section on data uses; summaries of the various programs and plans; a list of selected publications, tabulations, and data files; and a data collection calendar for that group of programs. Most program descriptions contain a brief introduction, a design section in which a blueprint of the program is described, a components section detailing what data are collected, and a final section addressing issues of concern to policymakers and researchers. elementary and secondary education. Important recent additions to the Center's data collection programs include the Schools and Staffing Survey, the National Household Education Survey, and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Studies Program. Together with the Common Core of Data, and a number of other surveys, they supply a wealth of information about elementary and secondary education in the nation. An important part of the elementary and secondary program is the publication of an annual report titled Dropout Rates in the United States. This publication reports numbers of dropouts as well as retention and graduation rates. The Current Population Survey (conducted by the Bureau of the Census) is the primary source of data for this report."}, {"section_title": "Data Uses:", "text": "The statistics collected from state education agencies and from other special surveys are used extensively by people outside of NCES. They are used for testimony before congressional committees, for planning in various federal executive departments, and for projects developed by professional organizations. They are also used by state executive and legislative staffs, by state and local education agencies, and by associations of local school systems. Other users are colleges, universities, and other facilities that do education research; various businesses that work with educational institutions; and the media in reporting on educational issues and events. Examples of data uses during this past year are reviewed below. Federal, state, and local governments make numerous requests for data. For example, Representatives often request data on the demographic characteristics of school districts in their states; federal agencies often request data on numbers of teachers and pupils by school level and type; major newspapers often request data on the number of public schools; state governments request data on high school dropouts and teacher attrition rates; and local governments request analyses of teacher demographics. In fact, the media often need a great deal of data on elementary and secondary education such as analyses of first-time teachers in the United States and foreign governments often request data on trends in American public schools. Colleges and universities often request copies of data tapes and CD-ROMS on NELS 8th grade cohort and SASS teacher files.\nThe NCES postsecondary education data systems provide such information as trends in enrollment and degree completion; patterns of expenditures and revenues of institutions; patterns of student financial aid; workload of faculty; and the relationship between educational experience and labor market outcomes. These data are used to describe the condition of postsecondary education and to monitor changes. Federal program staff have used IPEDS and student aid survey data to address policy issues on financial aid programs. Policymakers at the state and institutional level have used IPEDS (Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System) data for planning purposes. Government commissions have used these data to monitor compliance with federal legislation. Thousands of requests for information, based on the IPEDS and other postsecondary programs, are received by the Center each year. Those requesting data fall roughly into seven categories: (1) federal agencies; (2) state agencies; (3) national and regional education associations; (4) individual institutions; (5) the media; (6) the business community; and (7) the general public. Members of the executive branch, Congress or congressional committees, and a number of independent federal agencies use information from the Center on a regular basis. For example, an office of the legislative branch used IPEDS information to develop a profile of proprietary, less-than-2-year institutions. Several executive branch offices use the information to track baccalaureate and higher degree data by selected fields of study and minority status of degree recipients. An independent federal agency uses the information to track degree completions in engineering and scientific fields of study. State higher education agencies regularly use the data to help determine salary and fringe benefit packages for their full-time instructional staff. Other state agencies use the completions and institutional data on an annual basis to evaluate the availability of specific career training programs. Several state agencies have used the residence and migration data to determine where their high school graduates enroll in postsecondary education institutions. National and regional education associations annually request tabulations to determine enrollment patterns by racial/ethnic categories and fields of study, and finance data to review the economic health of postsecondary education institutions. Individual institutions use similar information at an institutional level for peer analyses and institutional planning purposes. These peer analyses range from comparing selected financial ratios to comparing proportions of minority student enrollments. The media, business community, and the general public use the information in a variety of ways. For example, one newspaper used the data to develop a major article that compares public 4-year institutions across selected states. Members of the business community have used degree completion data to target minority recruitment efforts in selected fields of study. The general public regularly requests information on which institutions offer degrees in specific fields of study.\nNAEP data have been employed in numerous ways by researchers, educators, policymakers, and the general public. Researchers have used NAEP data to describe performance trends in all subject areas, especially basic skills; to study achievement in the arts; and to analyze instructional practices and to conduct other research projects. Policymakers cite NAEP data to illustrate the state of the American education system. Educators have used the results to develop standards for improved mathematics and science curricula. Elected officials have used NAEP data to call for education reform. High school transcript data have been used for a variety of assessment purposes. In its 1983 report, A Nation at Risk, the National Commission on Excellence in Education recommended a specific minimal course of study in high school. In response to this report, NCES analyzed the High School and Beyond (HS&B) transcript study, comparing the coursetaking patterns of high school students graduating in 1982 to the curriculum recommended by 57 the Commission. In February 1984, NCES produced a report entitled \"How Well Do High School Graduates of Today Meet the Curriculum Standards of the National Commission on Excellence?\" which analyzed the relationships between the course-taking patterns of students in 1982 and selected characteristics of their schools. The 1990 High School Transcript Study compared the course-taking patterns of students in 1990 with similar patterns in 1987 and 1982. Extensive analyses of vocational education enrollments and of course-taking patterns of handicapped high school students have been conducted through the National Assessment of Vocational Education (NAVE).\nThe National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72) data have been widely used for investigating educational policy issues. For example, in the early 1980s, a congressional agency turned to these data to develop a model for estimating the costs of tuition tax credits. More recently, capsule descriptions of this cohort have been produced and attrition rates from college have been studied, as have transitions from high school and college into the workplace. Postsecondary attainment, access, and financial aid studies have all used NLS-72. Studies have noted that the NLS-72 studies have produced data which yield significant insights into contemporary America. The enlarged scope of High School and Beyond (HS&B) provided even more data than NLS-72 for examining a wide variety of education policy issues. HS&B produced a number of capsule descriptions of high school students. Additionally, HS&B data have been used to study the achievement of Hispanic students, discipline and order in high schools, economic issues such as students working while in school, comparisons of public and private schools, and course-taking patterns of American high school students. They also make it possible to compare the high school seniors of 19 10 and 1982 with those of 1972. The National Assessment of Vocational Education (NAVE) used the findings from the HS&B study in several of their reports. For example, NAVE used HS&B data for studies which attempted 73 to measure high school curricular experiences as they relate to vocational education; course enrollment patterns; and student financial aid as it relates to postsecondary vocational education. The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) completed the second followup data collection in 1992. Data from this survey are being used to study transition patterns of 8th-grade students as they move through school (e.g., moving from public to private school, dropping out of school, and moving into high school). Other research issues being addressed include:\nThe primary use of the DOVE system is to report on the status of vocational education. NCES has published a considerable number of reports on a range of vocational tonics, including students, teachers, and institutions. These publications are listed in the section on selected publications in this chapter. These publications include Vocational Education in the United States: 1969States: -1990, a recent NCES publication that synthesizes NCES vocational education data at both the secondary and postsecondary levels. In addition, the DOVE system was the primary data source for the National Assessment of Vocational Education (NAVE), a congressionally mandated evaluation of federal vocational education programs. For example, NAVE used the High School and Beyond data for studies which attempted to measure high school curricular experiences as they relate to vocational education; vocational education course enrollment patterns; and student financial aid for postsecondary vocational education. Listed below are the primary databases and components that are used by NCES for the analysis of vocational education issues. Only brief summaries of the surveys of interest are presented in this chapter. If a more complete description of a survey or component is needed, the reader should refer to the appropriate chapter. (Note: In this chapter, all major surveys are underlined, followed by the components of that particular survey. The surveys are grouped by categorysecondary, postsecondary, and longitudinal studies.)\nToday these data provide the only current, national descriptive data on the status of libraries. These data are used by federal, state, and local officials, professional associations, and local practitioners for planning, evaluation, and policymaking. These data are also valuable to researchers and educators for developing conclusions concerning the state and best use of libraries and their resources."}, {"section_title": "Surveys and ..;:kudies:", "text": "Common Core of Data: The Common Core of Data (CCD) is the Center's primary database on elementary and secondary public education in the United States. CCD is a comprehensive, annual, national statistical database of all public elementary and secondary schools and school districts that contains data that are comparable across all states. The objectives of the CCD are twofold. First, it is designed to provide an official listing of public elementary and secondary schools and school districts in the nation, which can be used to select samples for other NCES surveys. Secone, the CCD provides basic information and descriptive statistics on public elementary and secondary schools and schooling."}, {"section_title": "DESIGN:", "text": "The CCD survey collects data about all public elementary and secondary schools, all local education agencies, and all state education agencies throughout the United States. CCD contains three categories of information: general descriptive information on schools and school districts; data on students and staff; and fiscal data. The general descriptive information includes name, address, phone number, and type of locale; the data on students and staff include demographic characteristics; and the fiscal data cover revenues and expenditures. The CCD is made up of a set of six surveys sent to state education departments.' Most of the data are obtained .rom administrative records maintained by the state education agencies (SEAs). Statistical ink rmation is collected annually from public elementary and secondary schools (approximately 85,000) public school districts (approximately 15,000) and the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and outlying areas. The SEAS compile CCD data into prescribed formats and transmit the information to NCES.\nSchools are the primary sampling unit for SASS, and a sample of teachers is selected in each school. Public school districts are included in the sample when one or more of their schools is selected. In addition, Indian schools run by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs and tribally run schools were selected. The 1993-94 SASS, like the 1987-88 SASS, drew a stratified probability sample of approximately 13,000 schools (9,300 public and 3,500 private), 65,600 teachers (52,000 public and 13,000 private), and 5,600 public school districts. In the 1990-91 and 1993-94 SASS a sample of Bureau of Indian Affairs schools and teachers in those schools were selected (approximately 100 schools and 600 teachers). The 'survey is conducted by mail with telephone followup. The 1993-94 public school sample was selected from the Common Core of Data public school universe list maintained by NCES. All public schools in the file were stratified by the 50 states and the District of Columbia, and then by three grade levels (elementary, secondary, and combined). A special sample of public schools serving large numbers of American Indian or Alaskan Native students was also drawn to provide national estimates of their schools, teachers, and principals. The private school sample was selected in 1993-94 from the NCES 1989-90 Private School Universe file which consisted of a list frame of schools and a geographic area frame designed to improve coverage of private schools. All private schools on the universe file were stratified by the four census regions. and within each region, schools were further stratified by three grade levels (elementary, secondary, and combined), and by 18 types of private school association or religious affiliation. The Indian school sample was selected in 1993-94 from the Bureau of Indian Affairs' education directory, which consisted of a complete listing of all federally funded Indian schools. All Indian schools on the universe file were stratified by state (Arizona, New Mexico, South Dakota, or other) and within state, by three school levels (elementary, secondary, or combined). The SASS sample has been designed to support the following types of estimates and comparisons: national and state estimates for public schools and teachers; estimates for private schools and teachers at the national level and for selected groupings; national comparisons of elementary, secondary, and combined schools and teachers. New to the 1993-94 SASS were three components: a student records questionnaire, a school library/media center questionnaire, and a library/media librarian/specialist questionnaire. The questionnaire for student records component was sent to a subsample of approximately 1,200 public, 375 private schools, and 150 Indian schools selected for SASS. The administrative records for six students, on average, from each school are used to answer the questionnaire. The questionnaires for library/librarian components go to a subsample of approximately 5,000 public and 2,500 private schools participating in SASS. The implementation of these components in future cycles of SAS is dependent on the availability of funding.\nTwo questionnaires comprise the TFS: (a) the Teacher Followup Survey Questionnaire for Former Teachers; and (b) the Teacher Followup Survey Questionnaire for Continuing Teachers (those who remained in the same school as well as those who moved to another school). These questionnaires ask teachers about their current status, occupational changes and plans, reasons for staying in (or leaving) teaching, and attitudes about the teaching profession. The TFS was first conducted in the 1988-89 school year with a sample from the 1987 -88 SASS of about 2,500 teachers who had left teaching and 5,000 who were still in teaching. The Center also collected teacher followup data during the school year 1991-92, and plans another collection in 1994-95. Future followups will be 1 year after the administration of SASS, which will be conducted every 5 years. The TFS provides national data on the characteristics of those who leave teaching, their reasons for leaving, and their current occupational status. For those persons who remain in teaching, information is gathered on their career paths. Comparisons can be made among \"leavers,\" \"stayers,\" and \"movers\" (i.e., those teachers who remain in teaching but move to another school). Sampled teachers can be linked to the SASS data to determine relationships between local district and school policies/practices, teacher characteristics, and teacher attrition and retention.\nThe target population for the universe survey consists of all private schools in the United States that meet NCES criteria of a school. (A private school is an institution which provides instruction for any of grades 1-12, has one or more teachers t,0 give instruction, is not administered by a public agency, and is not operated in private home.) The survey universe is composed of schools identified from a variety of sources. The main source is a list frame, initially developed for the 1989-90 Private School Survey. This frame is based on a commercial list purchased from Quality Education Data (QED), Inc. The list is updated regularly matching it with lists provided by nationwide private school associations, state departments of citication, and other national guides and sources which list private schools. The other sources are area frame searches conducted by the Bureau of the Census.\nThe NHES is designed as a mechanism for collecting detailed information on educational issues from a relatively large and targeted sample of households in a timely fashion. Data for the NHES are collected through telephone interviews, a relatively new approach for gathering data related to education issues. The NI-'ES uses Random Digit Dialing (RDD) to select households and Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) to collect information from household members. The sample for the NHES is drawn from the noninstitutionalized civilian population in households having a telephone in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. In each NHFS, between 60,000 and 75,000 households are screened to identify persons eligible for one of the topical components. Generally, each collection covers two topical components, and between 10,000 and 15,000 interviews are obtained for each component. During the spring of 1991, NCES fielded an NHES on early childhood program participation. Approximately 60,000 households were screened to identify a sample of about 14,000 children 3 to 8 years old. The parents of these children were interviewed in order to collect information about their children's educational activities and the role of the family in children's learning. At the same time, an adult education component was fielded (see separate description in chapter 3). Adult household members were sampled and questioned about their participation in adult education. The two topical components covered in the spring of 1993 were early childhood/school readiness and school safety and discipline. Altogether, nearly 64,000 households were surveyed. In the school readiness component, parents of approximately 11,000 children 3 to 7 years old were asked about their children's experiences in early childhood programs, developmental level, school adjustment and related problems, early primary school experiences, general health and nutrition status, home activities, and family characteristics including family stability and economic risk factors. In the school safety and discipline component, parents of about 12,700 children in grades 3 through 12 were interviewed about their children's school environment, exposure to criminal behavior in the school, school discipline policy, and alcohol/drug education provided by the school. A sample of about 6,500 students in grades 6 through 12 were also interviewed about safety and discipline in their schools. Current plans call for a repeat of the NHES:91 topics, early childhood program participation and adult education, in the NHES:95. The NHES:96 will include parent participation in education and civic activities and youth involvement in activities that promote civic responsibility.\nThe Current Population Survey is a nationally representative probability sample survey of households. A multistage stratified sampling scheme is used to select sample households. The survey is conducted in approximately 60,000 dwelling units monthly in 729 primary sampling units. Dwelling units are in-sample for 4 successive months, out-of-sample for the next 8 months, and then returned to the sample for the following 4 months. An adult member of each household provides information for all members of the household.\nPostsecondary education is defined within IPEDS as the provision of a formal instructional program whose curriculum is designed primarily for students who are beyond the compulsory age for high school. This includes academic, vocational, and continuing professional education programs, and excludes avocational and adult basic education programs. The following types of institutions are included within IPEDS: baccalaureate or higher degree granting institutions, 2-year award institutions, and less-than-2-year institutions (i.e., institutions whose awards usually result in terminal occupational awards or are creditable toward a formal 2-year or higher award). Each of these three categories is further disaggregated by control (public, private nonprofit, and private for-profit) resulting in nine institutional categories or sectors. Several new concepts are employed for the IPEDS collection of postsecondary institutional education data. Data element definitions have been formulated and tested to be relevant to all providers of postsecondary education and consistent among components of the system. A set of data elements has been established to identify characteristics common to all providers of postsecondary education. Specific data elements have been established to define unique characteristics of different types of providers of postsecondary education. Interrelationships among various components of IPEDS have been established to avoid duplicative reporting and to enhance the policy relevance and analytic potential of the data. With IPEDS, it is possible to take into account the problems involved in trying to make interstate and inter-institutional comparisons using the NCES postsecondary data and to address many of these problems through the use of the clarifying questionsquestions that ask what was or was not included in a reported count or total. Finally, specialized, but compatible, reporting formats have been developed for the different sectors of postsecondary education providers. In general, the reports developed for postsecondary institutions granting baccalaureate and higher degrees are the most extensive; forms for the 2-year and less-than-2-year award granting sectors request less data. This design feature accommodates the varied operating characteristics, program offerings, and reporting capabilities that differentiate postsecondary institutional sectors while yielding comparable statistics for some common parameters of all postsecondary sectors.\nThe adult education component in the 1991 NHES was adapted from the previous Current Population Survey (CPS) adult education supplements. A knowledgeable adult was asked a series of questions to screen all household members for adult education participation. Altogether, interviews were obtained from approximately 9,800 adult education participants and 2,750 nonparticipants. At present, NCES plans to field the adult education component again in 1995.\nData from the RCG study are representative at the national level. The sample for the 1991 RGG was drawn using a two-stage sampling design from the universe of students who attained a bachelor's or master's degree some time during the 1989-90 academic year. The first stage consisted of drawing a sample of 400 bachelor's and master's degree-granting institutions from 1,978 institutions in the 1988-89 IPEDS completions file. Institutions were stratified by control (public or private) and by the number or proportion of degrees awarded in the field of education (over or under a specified number). Within each of these four strata, institutions were selected according to size (size being measured by the sum of bachelor's and master's degrees awarded that year). The size measure also gave additional weight to institutions according to the proportion of degrees awarded to blacks. Institution Sampling. The frame for first stage selection consisted of institutions from the 1988-89 IPEDS Completions tape that satisfied the following criteria: (1) the institution had a FICE code (i.e., was a \"higher education institution\": an institution accredited at the college level by an agency recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education); (2) the institution was in one of the 50 states or the District of Columbia; and (3) the institution was a 4-year (or above) institution that awarded bachelor's or master's degrees. Graduate Sampling. The second stage of the 1991 RCG design called for the selection of a core sample of 18,000 graduates [16,000 bachelor's degree recipients and 2,000 master's degree recipients who graduated during the 1989-90 academic year (July 1, 1989 and June 30,1990)] from the 400 sampled institutions. Simple random samples of graduates were selected from each defined subgroup (i.e., by field of study). The graduates included in the sample were selected in proportion to the institution's number of graduates. Graduates whose major fields of study were education, mathematics, and the physical sciences were sampled at a higher rate as were minority graduates to provide a sufficient number of these graduates for analysis purposes. Graduates were surveyed within 1 year after receiving a degree. For sampling, each graduate was classified into one of seven strata. All master's degree recipients were in one stratum, and bachelor's degree recipients were divided into the following strata: (1) black graduates; (2) Hispanic graduates; (3) education majors who were not black or Hispanic; (4) math majors who were not black or Hispanic; (5) physical science majors who were not black or Hispanic; and 6) all other graduates. A systematic sample of graduates was selected by stratum. The base rates for bachelor's and master's degree graduates were derived by taking the desired sample size and dividing by the number of graduates from all institutions in the universe. Oversampling was done to ensure adequate sample sizes for groups of interest. Black and Hispanic bachelor's degree recipients were oversampled at three times the base rate. Math and physical science bachelor's degree majors were oversampled at two times the base rate. Finally, education majors were oversampled at two and one-half times the base rate. The RCG studies are designed to meet certain objectives: (a) to determine how many graduates become eligible or qualified to teach for the first time and how many were employed as teachers in the year following graduation, by teaching fields; and (b) to examine the relationship between courses taken, student achievement, and occupational outcomes. The 1987 study also obtained information from college transcripts regarding types and patterns of courses taken by all baccalaureate degree recipients that year in their major field of study. NCES plans to produce a transcript file from the graduating institution transcripts of the 1989-90 graduates.\nThe NSOPF was conducted by NCES for the first time in the 1987-88 academic year. There were three major components of the study: a survey of institutional-level respondents in a stratified random sample of 480 institutions; a survey of a stratified random sample of 11,013 eligible instructional faculty members within the participating institutions; and a survey of a stratified random sample of 3,029 eligible department chairpersons (or their equivalent) within the participating institutions. Response rates to the three surveys were 88 percent, 76 percent, and 80 percent, respectively. The universe from which the institutions were selected included all nonproprietary U.S. postsecondary institutions that grant a 2-year (A.A.) or higher degree and whose accreditation at the higher education level is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. This includes religious, medical, and other specialized postsecondary institutions, as well as 2-and 4-year nonspecialized institutions. In 1987, according to the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), this universe comprised 3,159 institutions. The 1988 NSOPF gathered information regarding the backgrounds, responsibilities, workloads, salaries, benefits, and attitudes of both full-and part-time faculty. In addition, information was gathered from institutional and department-level respondents on such issues as faculty composition, turnover, recruitment, retention, and tenure policies. The second cycle of the National Survey of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF-93) is being conducted by NCES with additional support from the National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Information was gathered from approximately 30,000 faculty and 950 institutional-level respondents. NSOPF-93 expands the information base about faculty in several ways: it will allow for comparisons to be made over time; it will allow for more detailed comparisons among faculty in various disciplines, because of an increase in sample size; and it will be possible to examine critical issues surrounding faculty that have developed since the 1988 study and to describe research faculty as well as instructional faculty in higher education institutions. Data from the 1993 NSOPF will be available in 1995. Counts of faculty by rank; faculty hires and departures; tenure of faculty; tenure policies; retirement and other benefits for faculty. Department Chairperson Survey (only conducted as part of NSOPF-88): Faculty Survey: Faculty composition in department; tenure of faculty in department; tenure policies; rank; gender, and minority/nonminority status of faculty in department; faculty hires and departures in department; hiring practices; activities to assess faculty performance; professional and developmental activities. Sociodemographic characteristics; academic and professional background; field of instruction; employment history; current employment status including rank and tenure; outside employment; workload; courses taught; job satisfaction and attitudes; career and retirement plans; benefits and compensation.\nSurvey forms are mailed to graduate deans each May for distribution to individuals receiving their doctorates between July 1 and June 30 of the next year. The data are collected, edited, and published by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). By the end of the summer, the NAS publishes general survey results in a summary report and in a four-page flyer. NAS also provides detailed tabulations to each sponsoring agency.\nPEQIS employs a standing sample (panel) of approximately 1,500 postsecondary education institutions and a panel of 51 state higher education agencies. Three PEQIS surveys have been completed or are in progress. PEQIS # 1, requested by the Office of Policy and Planning/ED, is a study of the financial climate at colleges and universities and its effect on their institutional missions. PEQIS # 2, requested by the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services/ED, augments a congressionally mandated study of deaf and hard-ofhearing students in postsecondary education. PEQIS # 3, requested by the Office of Policy and Planning/ED, surveys institutions of higher education about programs designed to improve college access of disadvantaged students. This project provides coordination and communication between NCES and state postsecondary education agencies to enhance and expedite NCES data collection and dissemination activities. Project activities include meetings with the Network Advisory Committee and an annual national meeting and IPEDS workshop with the Network representatives from the State Higher Education Executive Officers agencies. The Network issues a quarterly bulletin containing information about NOES and state activities, provides an advisory service summarizing developing education issues and related data needs, and maintains a library service providing information about state and federal postsecondary education data collections. In addition, there is a personnel exchange service that provides funds for staff of state education agencies to visit each other to share technical assistance information regarding their data collection and dissemination efforts. The Network Director visits state agencies, attends postsecondary association meetings, and makes recommendations regarding new and developing issues in need of national data to inform education policymakers.\nNAEP was begun in 1969 and has periodically assessed students aged 9, 13, and 17 and at various grade levels. In 1983, several changes were made to the design to improve its use to policymakers. The student samples were expanded to include both age-and graderepresentative populations. The sample, since 1988, has been drawn from the universe of 4th, 8th, and 12th graders for the elementary and secondary school students survey; from the teachers of those students for the teacher survey; and from the school administrators at those elementary and secondary schools for the school characteristics and policy survey. A variation of matrix sampling (balanced incomplete block spiraling) was begun in packaging and administering assessment booklets. This method was used so that the results from a large number of items could be generalized to an entire population. Approximately 2,600 students respond to each block of items. The subject areas assessed have included: reading, writing, mathematics, science, citizenship, U.S. history, geography, social studies, art, music, literature, computer competence and career and occupational development. From time to time, NAEP has conducted special assessments in other educational areas such as health, energy, consumer math, and young adult literacy. NAEP also has collected background information from students, teachers, and administrators, and has related these data to student achievement. Performance data are reported for the nation, and for various subgroups categorized by variables such as region, gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, type of school, and type and size of community. Also initiated in 1983 was the reporting of performance data by scaled proficiency levels.\nThe 1990 High School Transcript Study consisted of systematically transcribing about 23,000 transcript records to determine the course-taking patterns of 12th-grade high school students selected from the 1990 NAEP assessment sample.With this connection, test results are linkable to course-taking patterns. All transcript information was collected by field personnel; no personal contacts were made with students. The following three summary tables are included in the 1990 study: (1) the percentage of high school graduates earning minimum credits in new basics courses in 1990 and the comparison of the totals to 1982 and 1987; (2) the mean number of credits (Carnegie units) that graduates earned in each major subject field in 1990; and (3) the number of students receiving credit in 1990 in secondary courses in the NCES' Classification of. Secondary School Courses (CSSC). The coded data are compatible with the data produced in the 1982 HS&B Transcript Study and the 1987 High School Transcript Study. This standardization and comparability will be useful in later analyses to compare the results of the three studies. It also has the cost advantage of avoiding unnecessary duplication of design work that has already been performed.\nThe 1992 National Adult Literacy Survey (NALS) defines literacy as \"using printed and written information to function in society, to achieve one's goals, and to develop one's knowledge and potential.\" Literacy is to be measured along three dimensions: (1) prose literacythe ability to understand and use information from connected texts that include editorials, news stories, poems; (2) document literacythe ability to locate and use information contained in documents, such as job applications or payroll forms, bus schedules, maps, tables, indexes; and (3) quantitative literacythe ability to apply arithmetic operations to numbers embedded in printed materials, such as balancing a checkbook, figuring a tip, completing an order form, or determining the amount of interest from a loan advertisement. Because policymakers need to assess a broad range of abilities in the population, but do not need to diagnose literacy problems of individuals, the 1992 assessment has been designed to cover a broad range of skills. It would take any one individual about 4 hours to complete the entire assessment. To keep the burden on any one individual to less than an hour, the assessment was cut into 13 blocks, with only 3 blocks given to each respondent. The design used balanced incomplete block spiraling, as in the National Assessment of Educational Progress, to assign systematically the parts of the assessment to individuals in a way that maximizes the information yield and permits generalizing the sample results to the U.S. population. The responses to the items are pooled and reported by proficiency scales on the three dimensions of literacy. All questions underwent extensive review by subject area and measurement specialists, as well as scrutiny to eliminate any bias or lack of sensitivity to particular groups. The National Adult Literacy Survey was administered in the summer of 1992 in person by trained interviewers to a nationally representative probability sample, of about 15,000 individuals aged 16 and older and to 1,000 adults incarcerated in federal and state prisons. In addition, 12 states funded sample supplements of 1,000 adults in order to obtain literacy estimates for their state populations. The results were published and the data are available to the public. This is the first national study of literacy for all adults since the Adult Performance Level surveys of the early 1970s. Assessed areas including: prose literacy; document literacy; and quantitative literacy. Other information includes race/ethnicity; age; sex; educational and occupational background; and reading habits.\nNLS-72 was designed to produce representative data at the national level on the cohort of students who were in the 12th grade in 1972. The sample for the base year of NLS-72 was a stratified, two-stage probability sample of 12th-grade students from all schools, public and private, in the 50 states and the District of Columbia during the 1971-72 school year. A sample of schools was selected in the first stage. In the second stage, a random sample of 18 high school seniors was selected within each participating school. Data were collected by mail, telephone, and personal interviews. In addition, the survey obtained school transcript data on high school curriculum, credit hours in major courses, grade point average, standardized test scores, and related information for each senior. To conduct intensive studies of disadvantaged students, NCES oversampled schools in low-income areas and schools with significant minority enrollments. The size of the student sample was increased during the first followup survey because base year nonrespondents were recontacted at that time. Those who provided base year information were retained and included in later followup efforts. Consequently, in 1972 there were 16,683 respondents, but in the first followup in 1973 the number jumped to 21,350. The number of respondents in subsequent followups in 1974, 1976, 1979, and 1986 were 20,872; 20,092; 18,630; and 12,841, respectively (only a subsample of the original sample was contacted in 1986). In addition to the followups, a number of supplemental data collection efforts were undertaken. For example, a Postsecondary Education Transcript Study was undertaken in 1984, and the fifth followup survey in 1986 included a supplement for those who became teachers.\nThe survey design provided for a highly stratified national probability sample of over 1,100 secondary schools as the first stage units of selection. Certain types of schools were oversampled to make the study more useful for policy analyses: public schools with a high percentage of Hispanic students; Catholic schools with a high percentage of minority group students; alternative public schools; and private schools with high achieving students. The initial national sample for High School and Beyond was considerably larger than that employed in NLS-72. In this stage, 36 seniors and 36 sophomores were selected in each school. Parents of these students were also sampled. In schools with fewer than 36 students in either of these groups, all eligible students were selected. The base year of this survey, which was conducted early in 1980, collected data from over 30,000 seniors and 28,000 sophomores. The longitudinal design of the study called for followup surveys of substantial subsets of the two cohorts at 2-year intervals. Data collection for the first followup began in spring 1982. Subsequent followups were also undertaken in 1984 and 1986, and another followup was conducted in 1992. The first followup survey conducted in 1982 sampled almost 40,000 students (12,000 seniors and 27,000 sophomores), the second in 1984 sampled approximately 27,000 students (12000 seniors and 15,000 sophomores), and the third in 1986 sampled almost 27,000 students (also 12,000 seniors and 15,000 sophomores). The 1992 followup collected data from almost 15,000 sophomores. In 1993, a new Postsecondary Education Transcript Study was conducted for the sophomore cohort. Data collection instruments in the base-year survey included: (1) sophomore and senior student questionnaires with a series of cognitive tests; (2) school questionnaires filled out by an official in each participating school; (3) teacher comment checklists fillet out by a teacher of the sampled student; (4) second language questionnaires; and (5) parent questionnaires filled 77 8E out by a sample of parents from both cohorts. The student questionnaires focused on individual and family background, high school experiences, work experiences, and future plans. Cognitive tests administered to students measured both verbal and quantitative abilities. Sophomore tests included brief achievement measures in science, writing, and civics, while seniors were asked to respond to tests measuring abstract and nonverbal abilities. The parent questionnaire elicited information about how family attitudes and financial planning affect educational goals. The school questionnaire gathered information about enrollment, staff, educational programs, facilities and services, dropout rates, and special programs for handicapped and disadvantaged students. The teacher comment checklist provided teacher observations on students participating in the survey. The first followup of sophomores provided insights into the school dropout problem and into the influence of the last 2 years of high school on student attitudes and aspirations. The second followup in 1984 included a Postsecondary Education Transcript Study of the senior cohort. The later followups of the sophomore cohort made it possible to trace the consequences of dropping out, and the extent to which dropouts later return and complete high school. In brief, HS&B provides information on the educational, vocational, and personal development of young people as they move from high school into postsecondary education or into the work force and then into adult life. The initial study (NLS-72) laid the groundwork for comparison with HS&B. It recorded the economic and social conditions surrounding high school seniors in that year and, within that context, their hopes and plans. It has since measured the outcomes while also observing the intervening processes. High School and Beyond allows researchers to monitor changes by retaining the same goals, measuring the economic returns of postsecondary education for minorities, and delineating the need for financial aid. By comparing the results of the two studies, researchers can determine how plans, and outcomes differ in response to changing conditions or remain the same despite such changes. Additional concerns of HS&B encompass issues that surfaced since NLS-72 began: How did the availability (or lack thereof) of student financial aid alter student plans for further education? Did middle-income families alter their attitude toward postsecondary education? These questions, as well as concerns about declining test scores, youth employment, and bilingual education are addressed, along with a host of others.\nThe base year sample of 1988 eighth graders was constructed to be representative at the national level. Two-stage probability sampling was used to select schools and students. The first stage involved stratified sampling of some 1,000 public and private schools from a universe of approximately 40,000 schools containing 8th-grade students. The second stage included random samples of approximately 24 to 26 students per school. Some 25,000 8th graders and their parents, their teachers, and their school principals were surveyed. When the student sample was selected, one parent, one school principal, and two teachers of each student were also selected as subsamples. Hispanic and Asian students were oversampled to permit analysis of the performance of language minority students. NELS:88 is designed to provide trend data about critical transitions experienced by young people as they develop, attend school, and embark on their careers. It will complement and strengthen state and local efforts by furnishing new information on how school policies, teacher practices, and family involvement affect student educational outcomes (i.e., academic achievement, persistence in school, and participation in postsecondary education). In the base year, four cognitive tests (reading, science, history/government, and math) were administered in addition to the student questionnaire, a parent questionnaire, a teacher questionnaire, and a school administrator questionnaire. The design for the NELS:88 First Followup Survey included student, school administrator, teacher, and dropout questionnaires. Students took cognitive tests in reading, science, history/government, and math. The tests were designed to reflect 10th-grade course work, but also had enough overlapping items with the 8th-and 12th-grade tests to permit measurement of academic growth. Selected teachers of each sampled student provided information about the student's study habits and performance and about instructional practices in the student's classes. The NELS:88 First Followup was conducted between February and May of 1990. During the spring of 1992, NCES surveyed this 8th-grade cohort again. This Second Followup Survey included student, school administrator, parent, teacher, and dropout questionnaires. Students and dropouts also took cognitive tests in reading, science, social science, and math. Transcripts were also collected from second follow-up participants. For those researchers interested in school effects analyses, NCES is also sponsoring a School Effects Supplement. In 250 of the NELS:88 schools, additional students and teachers have been added. This file should be available in the fall of 1994. During the spring of 1994, NCES followed this cohort again. The focus of the computerassisted telephone interviews was employment, education, and family formation experiences. The sampled population was interviewed in order to determine whether they completed high school, and if so by what means, (e.g., regular completion, GED, or some other method). The interview also collected information about other activities since the last interview in 1992 (e.g., working number of jobs, what periods worked, description of work and education, postsecondary activities, field of study, periods of time). This followup also asked questions about sexual activities (age at first sex, frequency, whether birth control way used, method of birth control used). The next followup is tentatively scheduled for 1998 by which time many in this cohort will have finished their postsecondary education and completed a transition into the labor force. Others will have been in the labor force for about 6 years.\nThe BPS is based on the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS). NPSAS is a large, nationally representative sample of institutions, students, and parents (see NPSAS description in chapter 3 for further information). As such, it provides a highly efficient and cost-effective way of identifying a nationally representative sample of beginning students in PSE. In addition, data from all components of NPSAS (the Student Record Abstract, the Student Interview, and the Parent Survey) are available as base year data for the BPS sample. BPS followed NPSAS:90 beginning students starting in 1992. About 8,000 students who began their PSE career in the 1989-90 academic year responded to NPSI .S:90 and were included in the first BPS (BPS:90/92) in the spring of 1992 and the second BPS (BPS: 90/94) in the spring of 1994. NPSAS:90 collected data for over 6,000 parents of those students. In addition to the student data which will be collected every 2-3 years, BPS will collect postsecondary transcripts and financial aid records covering the entire undergraduate period to provide complete information on progress and persistence. The first data from BPS became available in summer 1994. Access is possible through the Internet. Public use files on media other than Internet are expected to become available fall 1994. New BPS cohorts will alternate with the Baccalaureate and Beyond Study in using the NPSAS as their base. Year in school; persistence in enrollment; academic progress; change in field of study; institution transfer; education-related experiences; current family status; expenses and financial aid; employment and income; employment-related training; community service; political participation; graduate school plans; entry and progress in graduate school; future expectations.\nThe Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B) is based on the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) described previously. NPSAS is a large, nationally representative sample of institutions, students, and parents. As such, it provides a highly efficient and cost-effective way of identifying a nationally representative sample of baccalaureate degree completers in PSE. By using NPSAS as the base year for B&B longitudinal studies, two additional advantages are realized: (1) there is coordination between the recurring cross-sectional studies and the longitudinal studies; and (2) there is coordination among the postsecondary longitudinal studies. The information collected through NPSAS allows the accurate identification of baccalaureate degree completers. Further, data from all components of NPSAS (the Student Record Abstract, the Student Interview, and the Parent Survey) available as base year data for the B&B sample. B&B will follow NPSAS baccalaureate degree completers for a 12-year period after completion, beginning with NPSAS:93. About 11,000 students who completed their degree in the 1992-93 academic year were included in the first B&B (B&B:93/94). NPSAS:93 will also provide data for over 8,000 of their parents. In addition to the student data, B&B will collect postsecondary transcripts covering the undergraduate period, providing complete information on progress and persistence at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. New B&B cohorts will alternate with BPS in using NPSAS surveys as their base. Parent's race/ethnicity; marital status; age; level of education achieved; income; occupation; financial support provided to children; methods of financing student's PSE expenses; involvement in student's selection of graduate school; involvement in student obtaining job after graduation. Entry into graduate school; persistence in enrollment; periods of attendance; graduate loan burden; academic progress; change in field of study; education-related experiences; financial aid; current family status; entry into the work force; employment related training; entry and persistence in teaching; community service; political participation; further education plans; future expectations. 1Q 91 POLICY AND RESEARCH ISSUES: B&B will greatly expand the knowledge about persistence, progress, and attainment after entry into graduate education. It will also directly address issues concerning entry into the work force and rates of return. Its unique contribution will be the longitudinal perspective on the graduate education/work interaction and the longer range information concerning newly qualified teachers and their entry into and continuation in the field. Questions that B&B can address about access to graduate or professional programs include timing, the application process, and entry into the program. Attainment/outcome questions include completion time of BA, timing of entry into the work force, and relationship of field of study to area of employment. B&B will also be able to inform the rate of return questions, particularly those associated with immediate entry into the work force after completion of the bachelor's degree, issues concerning the interaction between education and work, and issues associated with entry into public service areas such as teaching and relative career advancement. In an attempt to be responsive to the information needs of the many education constituency groups concerned with students who are below the postsecondary level, NCES is currently planning a new study that will follow a sample of kindergarten children through fifth grade. This study will collect data across important transition points (e.g., kindergarten to elementary school). The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS) will collect information on the education experiences of young children and will be used to answer questions concerning how children's health, family, and educational histories affect their chances of succeeding in school. Once it is successfully implemented, ECLS will provide researchers and policymakers with an array of data on the early experiences of all children that may be used to examine the relationships between these experiences and childrens' later learning, attitudes, and behavior. Survey instruments will be administered to the school principal, parents, and teachers of sampled students. A field test of ECLS is planned for school year 1996-97 and a full-scale data collection in school year 1998-99.  1972 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 1986 National  1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1992 B F F F F Base Year and Years of Followup Studies 1988Studies 1989Studies 1990Studies 1991Studies 1992Studies 1993Studies 1994Studies 1998 National Education Data Uses: NCES receives many requests for information about education in other countries such as school achievement levels, school completion rates, school expenditure levels, and higher education enrollment rates. Policymakers, such as chief state school officers, governors, and local school officials, also want to know the average level of achievement in other countries. Most requests are for data concerning highly developed countries (e.g., Australia, Canada, England, France, Germany, and Japan).\nThe survey collects data on the libraries in the entire universe of accredited higher education institutions and on the libraries in nonaccredited institutions with a program of 4 years or more. ALS produces descriptive statistics on academic libraries in postsecondary institutions in the 50 states, the District of Columbia and the outlying areas. NCES has developed IDEALS, a software package for states to use in submitting ALS data to NCES. IDEALS was used by 45 states in 1992. Like FSCS, ALS has an advisory Committee. A librarian in each state helps state IPEDS coordinators collect, edit, and submit ALS data to NCES.\nThe most recent information on school libraries has been collected from a sample of public and private elementary and secondary schools in SASS. A few questions on school libraries were included in the 1990-91 SASS questionnaires. In addition, new questionnaires for school library media centers and on the school library media specialists were field-tested in the 1990-91 SASS for implementation in the next round of SASS. In school year 1993-94, a sample of about 7,600 public and private elementary and secondary schools was surveyed using two questionnaires. The school library media center questionnaire was designed to provide a national picture of school library media center facilities, collections, equipment, technology, staffing, inc ome, expenditures, and services. The school library media specialist/librarian questionnaire was designed to profile the school library media specialist work force, including demographic characteristics, academic background, work load, career histories and plans, compensation, and perceptions of the school library media specialist profession and workplace. The data are expected to be released in the summer of Data will provide a national picture of school library collections, expenditures, technology, and services. This information wiil be used by federal, state, and local policymakers and practitioners in assessing the status of school library media centers in the United States. The information will contribute to the assessment of the federal role in supporting school libraries. The library media specialist questionnaire will provide, for the first time, a national profile of the school library media specialist work force. Further information on school library statistics may be obtained from: NCES plans to continue collecting public library data through FSCS and to update the public library universe file annually. Efforts are being made to improve data quality, for example, by developing clearer definitions and improving state and local training. As data quality improves, NCES also hopes to do more sophisticated analyses of FSCS data including measuring changes, making regional, size, and input/output comparisons, and mapping data. Beginning in 1993, data collection efficiency was improved by collecting universe data as part of the annual data collection for public libraries with enhanced software called DECPLUS. Improved dissemination of data is also planned. The collection of academic library data through IPEDS will be continued also. NCES plans to improve the quality of the data by promoting the use of IDEALS software for data collection. New data elements focusing on electronic access and other new technologies may be added to the survey. The ALS reports will contain more detailed analyses of the data. NCES will continue school library data collection through SASS. The next survey is tentatively planned for school year 1998-99. Several topical surveys are also under way. In 1993, under the sponsorship of Library Programs, Department of Education, NCES conducted a fast response survey (FRSS) on public library services to children and young adults. NCES pretested a survey on federal libraries in 1993 and plans data collection for 1995. NCES is starting an annual survey on State library agencies with the first data collection for late 1994. The state library survey is a cooperative effort between NCES and the Council of State Library Agencies (COSLA). The federal library survey is a cooperative effort between NCES and the staff of the Federal Library and Information Center Committee (Library of Congress)."}, {"section_title": "COMPONENTS:", "text": "Public School Universe: Information on all public elementary and secondary schools in operation during a school year including school location and type; enrollment by grade and student characteristics; and the number of classroom teachers.\nQuestionnaire for Former Teachers: Survey of former teachers to ascertain primary occupational status (full-time); type of business; primary activity; time planning to spend in current job; new earned degrees, by type and field; plans for returning to teaching; reasons for leaving teaching; possible areas of dissatisfaction; salary; marital status; number of children; combined family income.\n1993-94 Private School Survey: Survey of private schools to ascertain religious orientation or other affiliation; level of school; size of school; length of school year, length of school day; total enrollment (K-12); number of high school graduates; number of teachers employed; whether school is operated in a private home; year school began operating; program emphasis.\nEarly Childhood: Program Participation Component (NHES:91; to be repeated in NHES:95) Household members; household characteristics; educational participation and attainment; early childhood education; detailed demographic characteristics.

It is treated separately here because it is implemented one year after SASS. The survey identifies and collects national-level data from public and private school teachers who have remained in the same school as the previous year, as well as those who have changed schools, and those who have left the teaching profession. These data are used to provide information about teacher attrition and retention in the public and private schools and to project teacher demand.\nThe TFS can be used to address a number of issues related to teacher turnover, shortages, and availability of an adequate supply of qualified teaching personnel. Leavers, movers, and stayers may be profiled and compared in terms of teaching qualifications, working conditions, attitudes toward teaching, salaries, benefits and other incentives and disincentives for remaining in or leaving the teaching profession. The TFS provides a measure of national teacher attrition by selected fields. Further information on TFS may be obtained from: With increasing concern about alternatives in education, the interest and nee'l for data on private education has also increased. NCES has made the collection of data on the universe of private elementary and secondary schools comparable to the Common Core of Data universe survey for public schools a priority. The purposes of this data collection activity are: (a) to build an accurate and complete list of private schools to serve as a sampling frame for NCES surveys of private schools; and (b) to report data on the total number of private schools, teachers, and students in the survey universe. The Private School Survey is conducted every 2 years with collections in 1989-90, 1991-92, and 1993-94; the next survey will be in 1995-96.\nThe Private School Survey produces data similar to that of the NCES Common Core of Data (CCD) for the public schools. The data are useful for a variety of policy-and researchrelevant issues, such as the growth of religiously affiliated schools, the number of private high school graduates, the length of the school year for various private schools, and the number of private school students and teachers. National Household Education Survey: The National Household Education Survey (NHES) is the first survey conducted by NCES to collect education data through a household-based survey. Historically, NCES has collected data from teachers, students, and schools through school-based surveys and from administrative records data through surveys of school districts and state education agencies. With a householdbased survey the NHES has the potential to address many issues in education that have not been addressed previously by NCES data collection activities. The NHES first full-scale NHES was conducted in the spring of 1991, and the second was conducted in the spring of 1993. The NHES will be conducted again in the spring of 1995 and in the spring of 1996 and thereafter on a biennial basis. Topical components will be repeated so that educational activities can be monitored over time.\nThe NHES is expected to provide data on a wide range of current education issues. Among the topics that may be addressed through the survey are: early childhood education; school-aged children's participation in before-and after-school programs; access and plans to finance postsecondary education; adult and continuing education; family support for and parental involvement in education; school safety and discipline; involvement in civic activities; grade retention; extra-school learning; and home-based education. data quickly and with minimum response burden. FRSS was designed to meet the data needs of Department of Education analysts, planners, and decisionmakers when information could not be collected quickly through traditional NCES surveys.\nThe CPS October Supplement provides important education data on enrollment, educational attainment, high school dropouts, retention, completion, and graduation rates. It also has provided policy-relevant data on private school tuition, adult education, vocational education, early childhood education, high school dropouts, and student mobility. The School District Mapping project aggregates demographic data acquired by the Bureau of the Census in the decennial census to totals for local education agencies and the states. The decennial census data are collected by census blocks which vary in size from less than a whole city block to a large portion of the state, depending upon the density of the population in the area. In the School District Mapping project, the location of each census block is identified with reference to the local education agency in which it appears either in whole or part. The census data for these blocks or parts of these blocks are then totaled to create local education agency totals.\nIPEDS data provide a wealth of institutional-level data for analyzing the state of postsecondary education institutions. For example, IPEDS data can be used (with HEGIS data) to describe long-term trends in higher education. The data necessary for conducting and interpreting special studies of postsecondary students, faculty, and staff are available within IPEDS. Using IPEDS data, policymakers and researchers can analyze postsecondary data on the number of students, graduates, first-time freshmen, and graduate and professional students by race/ethnicity and sex; the status of postsecondary vocational education programs; the number of individuals trained in certain occupational and vocational fields by sex, race/ethnicity, and level; the resources generated by postsecondary education; completions by type of program, level of award, race/ethnicity, and sex; and many other issues of interest. Beginning in 1993, all institutions eligible for funding under Title IV, Higher Education Act Amendment of 1987 (Public law 100-50), were surveyed using IPEDS. Other institutions received only an Institutional Characteristics survey. Within the group of institutions eligible under Title IV, those accredited at the college level by an agency recognized by National Household Education Survey (Adult Education Component): With increased attention being paid to adult learning, as a result of the national education goals and the concern about America's ability to compete in a global economy, there has been a heightened interest in more complete data on the educational activities of the adult population. The National Household Education Survey (NHES) provides the opportunity to collect information on a wide range of adult education experiences. The adult education component of NHES was implemented in the spring of 1991. (For more information on the other components, see the NHES description in chapter 2.)\nThe adult education component of the NHES can be used to address many questions about the patterns of participation, by demographic and labor force characteristics. It includes data on reasons for taking courses, on the providers of the courses, and the cost of the courses. Information is also collected from nonparticipants concerning barriers to their participation. The Recent College Graduates Study (RCG) estimated the potential supply of newly qualified teachers. It was a study of the immediate post-degree employment and education experiences of people who obtained a bachelor's or master's degree from an American college or university. It focused on those graduates qualified to teach at the elementary and secondary levels. The RCG was conducted periodically from 1976 to 1991. In 1993, NCES established a longitudinal survey of graduating college seniors, which replaced the RCG Study. This survey, Baccalaureate and Beyond, follows an oversample of graduating seniors from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (see chapter 5).\nThe supply of new teachers and the demand for their teaching services has changed dramatically over the past two decades. Because the RCG provides estimates of one source of teacher supply, new graduates, the data from this survey is of interest not only to federal policymakers but also to many elementary and secondary schools throughout the country. The RCG studies can be used to obtain data on: (a) the number and percent of recent graduates who are qualified to teach and who enter the teaching profession; (b) the kinds of jobs recent college graduates are getting by program area or major field; (c) the extent to which graduates get jobs in the area of their major field; (d) the extent to which jobs differ for men and women who graduate in the same program or major field; (e) unemployment of graduates; and (I) jobs obtained by baccalaureate or master's degree recipients that do not require a 4-year college degree. The National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) is a comprehensive, nationwide study of students enrolled in less-than-2-year institutions, community and junior colleges, 4-year colleges, and major universities located in the United States and Puerto Rico. Undergraduate, graduate, and first-professional students who receive financial aid, as well as those who do not receive aid, participate in NPSAS. The National Postsecondary Student Aid Study collects information on student demographics, family income, education expenses, employment, education aspirations, parental demographic characteristics, parental support, and how students and their families meet the costs of postsecondary education. In addition to describing characteristics of students enrolled in postsecondary education, the results are used in part to help determine future federal policy regarding student financial aid. The first NPSAS was conducted during the 1986-87 school year. Data were gathered from institutional records on about 60,000 students at 1,100 colleges, universities, and other postsecondary institutions. About 43,000 of these students and 13,000 parents also completed questionnaires. During 1989-90, information from institutional records on about 69,000 students at 1,130 postsecondary institutions was collected. About 51,400 students and 16,000 parents also completed computer-assisted telephone interviews. During 1992-93, information from institutional records on about 77,000 students at 1,000 postsecondary institutions was collected. About 52,000 students and 12,500 parents were interviewed by telephone. These data provided information on the cost of postsecondary education, the distribution of financial aid, and the characteristics of both aided and nonaided students and their families. The design for the NPSAS sample involves geographic areas, institutions within geographic areas, and students within institutions. To be eligible for inclusion in the institutional sample, an institution must have satisfied the following conditions: (1) offered an education program designed for persons who have completed secondary education; (2) offered an academic, occupational, or vocational program of study; (3) offered access to persons other than those employed by the institution; (4) offered more than just correspondence courses; (5) offered at least one program lasting 3 months or longer; and (6) was located in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico. NPSAS data come from multiple sources, including institutional records, and student and parent interviews. Detailed data concerning participation in student financial aid programs are extracted from institutional records. In 1986-87, family circumstances, demographic data, and plans and aspirations were collected using student and parent questionnaires. Beginning with the 1990 NPSAS, student and parent data were collected using a computer-assisted telephone interview. The 1987 NPSAS sampled students enrolled in the fall of 1986. Beginning with the 1990 NPSAS, students enrolled at any time during the year were eligible for the study. This design change provided the data necessary to estimate full-year financial aid awards. Beginning with the 1989-90 survey, NPSAS includes a longitudinal component and collects baseline data for a specified cohort of students. Students who began their postsecondary education during 1989-90 will be followed over time to examine such issues as persistence and effects of financial aid on subsequent enrollment. Students who graduate during 1992-93 will be followed over time to examine issues such as the transition from college to work and access to graduate school. These two surveys, known as the Beginning Postsecondary Level; major field of study; financial aid at other schools attended during year; other sources of financial support; monthly expenses; reasons for selecting the school they are attending; current marital status; age; race/ethnicity; sex; highest degree expected; employment and income; community service. Parents' marital status; age; highest level of education achieved; income; amount of financial support provided to children; types of financing used to pay child's educational expenses; occupation and industry.\nNPSAS covers a number of topics of interest to policymakers, educators, and researchers. For example, NPSAS analyzes the participation of students in financial aid programs. The goal is to identify institutional, student, and family characteristics and others related to program participation. Special population enrollment in postsecondary education is also analyzed. These populations include students with disabilities, racial and ethnic minorities, students taking remedial/developmental courses, students from families with low incomes, and older students. Another component of NPSAS is the study of the distribution of students by major field of study. Major fields of particular interest include mathematics, science, engineering, as well as teacher preparation and health studies. NPSAS generates data on factors associated with choice of postsecondary institution, participation in postsecondary vocational education, parental support for postsecondary education, and occupational and educational aspirations. Faculty are the pivotal resource around which postsecondary education revolves. They determine curriculum content, student performance standards, and the quality of students' preparation for careers. Faculty members perform research and development work upon which this nation's technological and economic advancement depend. Through their public service activities, they also contribute to the public good. For these reasons, it is essential to understand who they are; what they do; and whether, how, and why they are changing. The National Survey of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF) was designed to provide data about faculty to postsecondary education researchers, planners, and policymakers. NSOPF is the most comprehensive study of faculty in postsecondary educational institutions ever undertaken.\nThe NSOPF contains data which can be applied to policy and research issues related to postsecondary faculty. For example, NSOPF can be used to analyze whether the postsecondary labor force is declining or increasing. NSOPF data also can be used to analyze faculty job satisfaction and how it correlates with an area of specialization; and how background and specialization skills relate to present assignments. Comparisons can be made on academic rank and outside employment. Benefit, ,nd compensation can also be studied across institutions, and faculty can be aggregated by sociodemographic characteristics. This survey has collected basic statistics from the universe of doctoral recipients in the United States each year since the 1920s. It is supported by five federal agencies: the Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics in conjunction with the National Science Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Department of Agriculture, and the National Institutes of Health.\nFrom the Survey of Earned Doctorates data, it is possible to determine whether the number of doctoral recipients is increasing or decreasing, by field of study. The various sources of financial aid for doctoral students can be assessed, as can the average time it takes to complete the degree. Future or present employment can be studied, which is useful to postsecondary institutions and research facilities. Trend data on who is receiving doctorates by sex and race/ethnicity and other characteristics also can be analyzed. For more information on the Survey of Earned Doctorates contact: Policy analysts, program planners, and decisionmakers in postsecondary education frequently need data on emerging issues quickly. It is not always feasible for NCES to use its large, recurring surveys to provide such data quickly due to the length of time required to implement large-scale data collection efforts.. NCES has established PEQIS to collect timely data on focused issues needed for program planning and policy development with a minimum burden on respondents. In addition to obtaining information on emerging issues quickly, PEQIS surveys are also used to assess the feasibility of developing large-scale data collection efforts on a given topic or to supplement other NCES postsecondary surveys.\nA study group of policymakers was formed by the Secretary of Education in 1986 to examine NAEP. This study group produced the publication, The Nation's Report Card. It stated that policymakers were keenly interested in NAEP student assessment data because the data address the outcomes of education, specifically, the level of educational achievement. The group emphasized, however, that NAEP should produce data that are representative not only at the national level but also at the state level. New legislation enabled NAEP to begin pilot testing assessments at the state level during 1990. Such state-level results promise to make NAEP more useful for policymakers and the public. (See the \"Plans\" section of this chapter for a further explanation.) In addition to performance results in subject areas, NAEP collects basic descriptive information about students, teachers, administrators, schools, and communities. This information can be used to address the following four educational policy issues that are of concern to educators, policymakers, and researchers: (a) Instructional practiceWhat instructional methods are being used and how do these relate to achievement? (b) Students-at-riskHow many students appear to be at-risk, in terms of achievement, and what are their characteristics? (c) Teacher work forceWhat are the characteristics of teachers of various subjects? (d) Education reformWhat, if any, policy changes are being made by our nation's schools? Over the past 25 years, NAEP has generated more than 200 reports spanning 11 instructional areas. It is the nation's only ongoing, comparable, and representative assessment of what American students know and can do. A summary of NAEP findings since its inception through 1992 is available in the publication,   Four high school transcript studies have been conducted since 1980. The first was part of the High School and Beyond (HS&B) first followup survey in 1982 (see chapter 5 for more information on HS&B). About 12,000 transcripts were collected from school records for HS&B sophomore cohort students who were seniors in 1982. Another transcript survey was conducted in conjunction with the 1992 second follow up survey from the National Education Longitudinal Study (see chapter 5 for more information). Two other transcript studies were done in conjunction with the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The 1987 High School Transcript Study surveyed approximately 22,700 seniors who had participated (as 11th graders) in the 1986 National Assessment of Educational Progress. In 1983, the National Commission on Excellence in Education recommended a specific minimal course of study in high school. In 1988, the U.S. Department of Education evaluated the way the nation responded to the call for school reform. In its report, American Education: Making It Work, the recommended curriculum was compared with the actual course-taking patterns of 12th-grade students in 1982 and in 1987. The 1990 High School Transcript Study, done in conjunction with NAEP, can be used to track changes in the curricular patterns of high school students. Data files and documentation were released in 1993. A 1994 High School Transcript Study is being conducted in association with the 1994 NAEP. To ensure maximum compatibility, the procedures and formats used in previous studies for editing, coding, error resolution, and documentation were also used for the 1990 transcript data. This consistency enables users to compare cohorts with a minimum of effort. The 1990 study reflects modifications in course-taking over the period 1987 to 1990. \nHigh school transcript data inform researchers and policymakers about the course-taking patterns of students. Since the report, A Nation At Risk, there have been a number of critics advocating the strengthening of the high school core curriculum. Students have been encouraged to increase their academic load with courses in English, mathematics, science, social studies, computers, and foreign languages. As NCES has conducted more transcript studies, overall trends in course-taking patterns can be traced. Transcript data are measures of exposure, rather than measures of learning. More research is needed to determine what effect this content exposure has on student achievement. The NAEP study allows investigation of the relationship between course-taking patterns and performance on the 1990 NAEP. For more information on the high school transcript studies, contact: 1982 and 1992 Study: National Adult Literacy Survey: Literacy assessments inform policymakers about the extent of basic skills in using printed information that the adult population needs to function in society, to achieve their goals, and to develop their knowledge and potential. Recently, concern has mounted that inadequacies in the literacy of American workers are reducing the competitiveness of the American economy and preventing some Americans from exercising the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. The National Adult Literacy Survey provides an accurate benchmark for measuring the literacy capabilities of adults.\nThere has been serious concern about the literacy level of the American work force, as described in a number of national reports published since 1980, including A Nation At Risk, Toward a More Perfect Union, The Subtle Danger, Work Force 2000, The Bottom Line, and Literacy: Profiles of America's Young Adults. These reports have emphasized the need to increase our nation's standard of literacy in order to maintain our standard of living and to compete in global markets. This concern about literacy culminated in 1990, when the President and the governors adopted six national education goals, including: \"By the year 2000, every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.\" National programs to improve adult skills need to be based on knowledge about the nature and severity of the deficits in literacy. The role of the National Adult Literacy Survey is to provide the elementary facts needed to begin understanding our nation's literacy problem. At the time this publication went to press, legislation to authorize national and state NAEP assessments beyond 1994 was pending in Congress. Therefore, the exact timing and content of future NAEP assessments is uncertain. Current plans are for an assessment in 1996 of two or three subjects in three grades at the national level and two subjects in one grade at the state level. NAEP has been evaluating the national performance of students on achievement tests in specific subject areas since 1969. However, since the curricula are changing, NAEP must also change. A consensus process was used to develop 1994 assessments in reading, U.S. history, and geography. NAEP is also incorporating new assessment techniques. In 1990, about 2.5 million open-ended items were scored in connection with the mathematics assessment. In addition, the 1992 writing assessment, an assessment consisting totally of open-ended items, was scored with primary trait, holistic, and writing mechanics scoring procedures. Other new assessment techniques have included the use of calculators in the 1990 and 1992 mathematics assessments, a special study on the use of timed mathematics items to measure students' ability to estimate the correct answer; and in the 1994 history assessment, a special study on group problem solving. NCES will provide continuing reviews of NAEP through an independent evaluation of the trial state assessments, a NAEP technical review panel, and validation studies. Additionally, NCES will solicit public comment on the conduct and usefulness of NAEP by holding open meetings across the country. Work is continuing on developing a plan to assess postsecondary student learning, workplace skills, and adult literacy. Analyses of the data from the 1992 National Adult Literacy Study will continue and additional publications will he released.  , 1969-70 to 1990Mathematics, 1973Mathematics, -1990Reading 1971Reading to 1990andWriting, 1984 to 1990 1988 1990 1992 1994 19963 National Assessment of Educational Progress Consequently, such studies are critical to understanding the processes by which education leads individuals to develop their abilities and their roles in society. The National Longitudinal Study of 1972 began with that year's high school senior class and followed them through 1986. The High School and Beyond study began with both the sophomore and senior classes of 1980. Three other longitudinal studies are being conducted currently: the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 began with the 8th-grade class of 1988; the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study started with postsecondary students who began their postsecondary education in 1989-90; and the Baccalaureate and Beyond Study was conducted in 1993-94. A new longitudinal study, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, is being planned for the 1998-99 school year.\nNLS-72 can provide information about quality, equity, and diversity of educational opportunity and the effect of those factors on cognitive growth, individual development, and educational outcomes. It can also provide information about changes in educational and career outcomes and other transitions over time.   New education issues arose after NCES began its longitudinal study of the 1972 senior class. Declining test scores and minimum competency testing, for example, caused concern among parents and educators alike. The rate at which many students dropped out of high school before graduation was also a concern. Increased opportunities in secondary school vocational education opened new vistas for youths attentive to their futures. And anxiety over access to postsecondary and vocational education sharpened the focus on the education experiences of Hispanic and other minority youths. To examine these and other issues, NCES initiated a second longitudinal study, High School and Beyond (HS&B), to complement the first. HS&B studied the high school students of 1980. It attempted to collect the same types of data gathered in the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972. However, the second study differed from the first in two significant ways. First, it addressed many newer issues of the educational process. Second, it included a sophomore cohort as well as a senior cohort. Adding the sophomore cohort made it possible to study high school dropouts and to analyze changes and processes during high school.\nThe base year survey of HS&B and the followup surveys have addressed the issues of educational attainment, employment, family formation, personal values, and community activities since 1980. For example, a major study on high school dropouts used HS&B data to demonstrate that a large number of dropouts return to school and earn a high school diploma or an equivalency certificate. Other examples of issues and questions that can be addressed with HS&B data are: (a) How, when, and why do students enroll in postsecondary education institutions? (b) Did those who (while in high school) expected to complete the baccalaureate (BA) degree actually do so? (c) How has the percentage of recent graduates from a given cohort who enter the work force in their field changed over the past years? (d) What are the long-term effects of not completing high school in the traditional way? How do employment and earnings event histories of traditional high school graduates differ from those who did not finish high school in the traditional manner? (e) Do individuals who attend college earn more than those who do not attend college? What is the effect of student financial aid? (f) What percent of college graduates are eligible or qualified to enter a public service profession such 79 as teaching? (g) How many enter the work force full time in the area for which they are qualified? (h) How and in what ways do public and private schools differ? For more information on High School and Beyond contact: The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) was the third major longitudinal study sponsored by the NCES. The two studies that preceded NELS:88 (the National Longitudinal Study of 1972/NLS-72 and High School and Beyond/HS&B) surveyed high school seniors (and sophomores in HS&B) through high school, postsecondary education, and work and family formation experiences. Taken together, the longitudinal studies provide not only measures of educational attainment but also rich resources in determining the reasons for and consequences of academic success and failure. NELS:88 seeks to expand on this base of knowledge by following young adolescents starting at an earlier age (8th grade) and by updating information throughout the 1990s.\nThe longitudinal design of this study permits the examination of change in young people's lives and the role of schools in promoting growth and positive life outcomes. For example, NELS:88 data can be used to investigate: The transition from elementary to secondary school. The survey will permit the investigation of ways students are assigned to curricular programs and courses and how such assignments affect their academic performance as well as future career and postsecondary education choices. The students' academic growth over time. Family, community, school, and classroom factors that promote such growth can be studied. The goal is to identify school and classroom characteristics and practices that promote student learning. The effects of changing composition of the family, which is evidenced by increasing numbers of working mothers and families headed by single parents, also can be studied.\nThere is a great deal of interest in the findings of international student assessment studies and in the development of education indicators which facilitate comparisons among national systems of education. This interest has been spurred by increased concern about global economic competition and the role education plays in ensuring economic power. The assessment studies provide answers to the question of how other countries educate their children and with what success. Such comparisons lead to re-examinations of our own teaching practices and challenge the conventional wisdom underlying them. The impetus for much of the educational reform movement of the 1980s came from the international comparisons reported in A Nation At Risk. The assessments not only compare the performance of American students with that of their peers in other nations but also provide insights into the factors that influence performance. The OECD educational indicators data will provide more comparable information about the activities and outcomes of educational systems and institutions in member countries. Such data can lead to improvements in accountability and policymaking. These data are increasingly relevant to policy formulation due to the growing political, economic, and cultural ties among countries. For further information on international education statistics contact: and Studies section of this chapter for a list of the surveys). A beneficial aspect of the system is that it allows researchers to compare students who are concentrating in vocational education with those students who are not concentrating in vocational education. One of the greatest changes that NCES made in its data collection system for vocational education at the secondary level was how it collects data about enrollment. Instead of relying on reports from states that categorize students as being either vocational or nonvocational, NCES is collecting high school transcripts that indicate how much vocational education students take. This method of obtaining the data provides a more accurate picture of participation in vocational education, particularly since previous transcript studies showed that 97 percent of all graduating high school students had completed at least one course in vocational education in 1990.\nLibraries provide essential learning resources that strengthen and perpetuate formal and informal education. Valid, reliable, and timely statistics are essential for effective use by policymakers in determining the investment of public resources in library development and operations. Library and information science covers a diverse and rapidly changing field. Data collection activity which seeks to inform decisionmaking must be sensitive to the changes 118 taking place within the library community, and its policymakers and researchers. In November 1991, NCES initiated an effort to promote the use of public library statistics among researchers and policymakers by holding a public library statistics seminar for these groups. Also, the new universe file will make it possible to do surveys on topics of policy and research importance such as access for Americans with disabilities, networks and cooperatives, and library construction. Further information on public library statistics may be obtained from: NCES surveyed academic libraries on a 3-year cycle between 1966 and 1988. Since 1988, the Academic Libraries Survey (ALS) has been a component of the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS, see chapter 3) and is on a 2-year cycle. ALS provides data on about 3,500 academic libraries. In aggregate, these data provide an overview of the status of academic libraries nationally and statewide.\nALS data provide information for policymakers and researchers on trends in total operating expenditures on academic libraries, services available to students, and adoption of new technologies such as giving students and researchers electronic access to bibliographic information. The survey also provides information on the staffing of academic libraries. Further information on academic library statistics may be obtained from: The last national survey exclusively on school library media centers was conducted in school year 1985-86. NCES now asks questions on libraries in public and private schools as part of the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS, see chapter 2). In the 1990-91 SASS, NCES field-tested two new questionnaires for school libraries. These questionnaires were revised and a sample survey was conducted in school year 1993-94 of about 7,600 schools."}, {"section_title": "Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS):", "text": "School work force and teacher supply and demand information is critical to the effective management of America's public and private schools. Yet, until 1988, there was a lack of data on characteristics of teachers and administrators and their workplaces. The Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) was designed to meet this need. It is a comprehensive public and private education data system that combines and expands other surveys NCES conducted in the past. SASS was implemented in the 1987-88, 1990-91 and in 1993-94 school years, and is now planned to be conducted at 5-year intervals in the future.

The Forum's primary mission is to work with NCES to improve the overall quality,timeliness, and comparability of education statistics across the nation. It was mandated by the Hawkins-Stafford Education Improvement Amendments of 1988 (Public Law 100-297). Under the direction of its Steering Committee, the Forum maintains three standing committees: the National Education Statistics Agenda Committee; the Technology, Dissemination, and Communication Committee; and the Policies, Programs, and Implementation Committee. At present, the Forum is addressing such important issues as facilitating uniform development in state automated data systems; identifying a core of data items to be defined consistently by all users and for all purposes; developing strategies for improving federal, state, and local data collection and reporting capability; and discussing NCES options for new and innovative projects aimed at improving the quality of education statistics. In addition to these efforts, the Forum is available to respond to specific requests from the Commissioner of NCES, and to raise issues and make recommendations of its own. By bringing federal and state representatives together to work cooperatively toward improving the quality of education statistics, the Forum plays an important role in determining the future of our nation's education statistics system. In 1990, the National Forum issued its first publication, the Guide To Improving the National Education Data System. The Guide contains 36 recommendations for improving the nation's elementary and secondary education statistics system. This proposed national education data agenda is the product of a broad-based, consensus-building process that brought together representatives of state and federal education agencies and of organizations with a major interest in education data. In 1992, the Forum completed a feasibility study preliminary to addressing the recommendations. The group sponsored the \"Standards for Education Data Collection and Reporting,\" a set of best-practice principles to be disseminated widely in order to improve data quality and comparability. Reports of site visits assessing more than 20 state education agency data systems in terms of their potential for increased automation are also available. Plans for Elementary and Secondary Education: The core surveys of the NCES elementary and secondary program are: the Common Core of Data (CCD), the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (described in chapter 5), the National Household Education Survey (NHES), the Fast Response Survey System (FRSS), the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), and the Private School Survey (PSS). Additional topical supplements may be attached to these continuing surveys so that current data on key issues can be produced. A recent innovation of the CCD is the joint collection of local school district revenue and expenditure data with the U.S. Bureau of the Census. By adding data items to the Census' F-33 Survey of Local Governments, the CCD now publishes detailed annual finance data for all school districts in years ending with \"2\" or \"5,\" and for a nationally representative sample of school districts in all other years. This school-district financial information has been merged with data from the expanded CCD Agency Universe Survey and selected demographic variables from the 1990 decennial Census on a CD-ROM that contains 5 years worth of CCD data about states, school districts, and schools. The CD-ROM is a powerful and easy to use research tool. It includes, for example, information about the numbers of students enrolled by grade, high school graduates, and dropouts; the numbers and types of education staff within the school district; the numbers of school age children in poverty, and with varying degrees of English language proficiency; and detail about revenues from local, state, and federal sources as well as expenditures for instruction, support services, and education administration. The newly revised NCES data handbooks provide valuable technical assistance to those collecting elementary/secondary education data. During the 1994-95 school year, NCES will publish a Staff Data Handbook and a Student Data Handbook. Both hard-copy and electronic forms will be available. The National Cooperative Education Statistics System serves as the vehicle for NCES and the states to collaborate in developing the infrastructure that will support electronic data transmission for a variety of education purposes. The National Forum on Education Statistics, which plans and carries out much of the Cooperative system's work, supports such projects as the Internet Demonstration Project (using the Internet for data reporting and access), SPEEDE/ExPRESS (a format for electronic transmission of student transcripts), and feasibility studies for states planning to institute or expand automated record systems. In addition, the Forum will consider data policy issues in the areas of privacy and access to information and criteria for identifying data items that should be defined consistently under all circumstances. The NHES continues to he a rich resource for data that cannot be obtained through NCES' existing institution-based surveys. Although previous plans called for the NHES to he conducted on an annual basis beginning in 1993, current plans have moved it to a biennial collection cycle with spring collections of at least two topical components taking place in 1991, 1993,1995,1996,1998,2000, and so on. The 1991 topics, which will be repeated in 1995, are early childhood program participation and adult and continuing education. The 1993 topics were early childhood school readiness and school safety and discipline. Topics in the early stages of development for 1996 are parental participation in education and civic activities and youth involvement in activities that promote civic responsibility. In an attempt to be responsive to the information needs of the many education constituency groups below the postsecondary level, NCES is currently planning a new longitudinal study, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS) (see the section on Plans for Longitudinal Studies in chapter 5). Since the summer of 1991, staff working on SASS along with Census Bureau staff and other researchers have been working in a number of areas to improve methods and procedures for future data collection cycles.  1988 1989 1990 1991 Year of Data Collection 1992 1993 1994 1995 199619971998 1999 Common"}, {"section_title": "Schools and Staffing Survey", "text": "Teacher Demand and Shortage Questionnaire 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 Additional SASS Components"}, {"section_title": "Postsecondary Education", "text": "Social, demographic, educational, and economic issues challenge postsecondary education today.

The NCES program in postsecondary education provides statistical information used by planners, policymakers, and educators in addressing these issues. One major source of this information is the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), an annual series of surveys conducted by NCES that provides a variety of data on the nation's 10,600 public and private postsecondary institutions.

The members attend annual meetings coordinated by the American Council on Education. Topics for discussion include NCES postsecondary projects in the planning and developmental stages and new postsecondary issues which may affect NCES data collections. Plans for Postsecondary Education: NCES will continue to collect data for all IPEDS components, except the Early Estimates System which has been discontinued. However, the forms used to collect the data will be modified starting in 1995. State and institutional representatives reviewed and discussed these changes at an IPEDS workshop held in March 1994. IPEDS will continue to provide a sampling frame for other postsecondary surveys such as the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study. The Postsecondary Education Quick Information System will be used to collect data for addressing emerging and focused issues that the ongoing data collection systems are unable to provide. NPSAS will continue to serve as the base for two postsecondary longitudinal surveys: Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS) and Baccalaureate and Beyond (B&B). The BPS survey began in 1990 and is described in chapter 5. B&B, which began in 1993, is studying the educational and work-related achievements of a postsecondary graduating cohort as the members continue on to graduate or professional education, or enter the work force. It is discussed in chapter 5. A feasibility study has been completed and postsecondary institutions are in the process of producing an automated data system for a nationwide electronic records transfer system. The \"Standardization of Postsecondary Education Electronic Data Exchange (SPEEDE)\" has been designed for the development of a set of data elements and definitions in American National Standards Institute format to be used in the pilot electronic transfer of student records between districts and from districts to postsecondary institutions. Data elements are included in five different areas: demographics, academic history, special programs and services, health, and test information. NCES is examining other applications for the electronic exchange of data among postsecondary institutions. The Student-Right-to-Know and Campus Security Act (SRK) of 1990 (P.L. 101-542) required postsecondary institutions (starting in July 1993) to make available to students and prospective students the institutions' graduation and/or completion rates for full-time, degreeseeking undergraduates. It also requires institutions that award athletically related student aid to report such rates for athletes and other students. As required by P.L. 101-542, a report, Postsecondary Student Outcomes: A Feasibility Study, was completed in FY 92 by the Secretary of Education to address institutions' ability to report graduation/completion rates by academic major, schools within institutions, and a variety of student characteristics. An analysis of institutions' ability to report other outcome measures for completers, such as employment in a related field, was included in this report. In response to the legislation, and based on the findings from the feasibility study, NCES is planning to collect, compile, and report graduation/completion rates of postsecondary institutions in conjunction with the implementation of the Student-Right-to-Know Legislation. When the planning and design phases are completed, institutional graduation/completion rate data will be collected through the Integrated Postsecondary Education System (IPEDS) from the universe of all postsecondary institutions in the United States eligible for Title IV financial aid. As the provisions of the Student-Right-to-Know Act of 1990 and the Higher Education Reauthorization Act of 1992 are implemented, there will be new and increasing demands for developing comparable and uniform postsecondary education information, particularly with respect to student outcomes and postsecondary institutional performance. Additionally, as state legislatures, the Education Department and other federal agencies, and consumers make decisions regarding the value of postsecondary education and its providers, the need for disseminating this information so it is useful, meaningful, and comparable will be crucial. Meeting the challenges of maintaining current data and possibly establishing new data collection activities will take a unified and cooperative effort among institutions, states, and NCES. In order to support this effort, NM's reauthorization of 1994 includes the extension of the National Cooperative Education Statistics System (NCESS) to postsecondary education. is \"to produce and maintain with the cooperation of the states, comparable and uniform educational information and data that are useful for policy making at the Federal, state, and local, and institutional levels.\" In FY 1995, NCES will begin developing the structure and identifying specific activities for the NPECSS. This system should be fully implemented in FY 1997.  : 1979: , 1984: (January 1992 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 Integrated Salaries, Tenure, and Educational Assessment Assessing the educational outcomes of American students is a major function of NCES. This is achieved primarily through the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). For more than two decades, NAEP has regularly collected and reported information on the knowledge and skills of a national sample of both age-and grade-representative populations in a variety of school subjects. Insights into the educational practices and outcomes of the United States are also obtained by comparing them with other countries. This is achievtA through the International Education Statistics Program at NCES, which provides systematic statistical data on the educational experiences and trends in other countries. Information comparing the public expenditures for schooling, participation rates of school-age children, and education achievement levels of the various national populations are disseminated in the major NCES reports and other specialized studies. Another way to study education outcomes is to investigate the courses of study students have taken. Four surveys have collected data on courses of study in high school: the 1982 High School and Beyond (HS&B) transcript study, the 1987 High School Transcript Study, the 1990 High School Transcript Study, and the 1992 National Education Longitudinal Study. The information gathered from the transcript studies has proven very useful and such studies are proposed for the future. Additionally, postsecondary transcripts are part of longitudinal studies at NCES, as well as the Recent College Graduates Study. NCES also assessed educational outcomes among adults through the National Adult Literacy Survey. In 1992 NCES conducted a full-scale, household-based literacy survey of Iu Its age 16 and over."}, {"section_title": "National Assessment of Educational Progress:", "text": "The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is mandated by Congress (GEPA, Section 406) to monitor continuously the knowledge, skills, and performance of the nation's children and youth. Under this legislation, NAEP is required to provide objective data about student performance at national, regional, and, on a trial basis, state levels. In 1988, Congress amended this legislation to establish the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGS). The purpose of NAGB is to provide policy guidance for the execution of NAEP. The Board is composed of national and local elected officials, chief state school officers, classroom teachers, local school board members, and leaders of the business community, and others. Specifically, it has been charged by Congress to perform the following duties: select subject areas to be assessed; identify appropriate achievement goals for each age group; develop assessment objectives; design the methodology of the assessment; and produce guidelines and standards for national, regional, and state comparisons. Prior to 1990, NAEP was required to assess reading, mathematics, and writing at least once every 5 years. The current legislation requires assessments in reading and mathematics at least every 2 years, in science and writing at least every 4 years, and in history or geography and other subjects selected by the Board at least every 6 years."}, {"section_title": "59", "text": "Beginning with the 1990 assessment, NAGB established three reporting levels for reporting NAEP results: basic, proficient, and advanced. All questions undergo extensive reviews by subject-area and measurement specialists, as well as careful scrutiny to eliminate any potential bias or lack of sensitivity to particular groups. They are then field tested, revised, and administered to a stratified, multi-stage probability sample. The individuals sampled are selected so that their results may be generalized to the entire country. Once the data have been collected, scored, and analyzed, NAEP publishes and disseminates the results. Currently, NAEP is conducted every other year in even-numbered years. In 1988, NAEP assessed student performance in reading, writing, civics, and U.S. history and conducted a small special interest assessment in geography; in 1990, reading, mathematics, writing, and science, were assessed; in 1992, reading, mathematics, and writing were assessed; and in 1994, reading, U.S. history, and world geography were assessed. NAEP has been designed to produce a representative sample at the national level. In each of the 1990-94 assessments, data were collected from a national probability sample of over 45,000 students per age/grade or a total of about 146,000 students in nearly 2,100 schools. Data were also collected from these students' principals and a sample of their teachers. Representative state-level data were produced for the first time for participating states from the trial state assessment in 1990 for mathematics at the 8th-grade level. In 1992, state-level data were collected in fourth grade reading and mathematics and eighth grade mathematics. In 1994, state-level data were collected in fourth grade reading. The 1995 field test will include several feasibility studies to increase the participation of students with disabilities and limited English proficiency. These will include administering sample test booklets in braille, large print, and Spanish and varying the testing times and methods. If the accommodations and adaptations are found to be feasible from the field test then they will be implemented in future NAEP assessments.

This will provide the ability to analyze the differences (if any) between traditional (recent high school graduates) and nontraditional (older) students in aspirations, progress, persistence, and attainment. Among the questions BPS can address related to persistence are: Do students who are part-time or discontinuous attenders have the same educational goals as full-time, consistent attenders? Are they as likely to attain similar educational goals? Are students who change majors more or less likely to persist? Are nontraditional students more or less likely to persist than their more traditional counterparts?

What educational experiences are related to \"normal\" and consistent progress? Is likelihood of transfer related between institutions to academic major? Attainment/outcome questions include: At what rate do those who intend to complete an educational program at or below the baccalaureate level do so? What educational experiences encourage completion? How long does it take to complete the program? Questions which BPS can address about access to graduate and professional programs concern timing, the application process, and entry into the program. BPS will also be able to provide information on rate of return questions, particularly those associated with immediate entry into the work force after completion of a program of less than 4 years.

It will continue to provide cross-sectional information 1 year after bachelor's degree completion (comparable to the Recent College Graduate survey), while at the same time providing longitudinal data concerning entry into and progress through graduate level education, and the work force. A special emphasis of B&B will be on those entering public service areas, particularly teaching. B&B will provide information on entry into, persistence and progress through, and completion of graduate level education information not available through followups involving high school cohorts or even college entry cohorts, both of which are restricted in the number who actually complete the bachelor's degree and continue their education. B&B plans to follow each cohort over a 12-year period, allowing a unique opportunity to gather information concerning delayed entry into graduate level education, timfts to completion of graduate education, and the interactions between work and education at the graduate level."}, {"section_title": "OECD International Education Indicators Project (INES):", "text": "NCES has been working cooperatively with the member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) since 1988 to develop an education indicator reporting system.

NCES chairs Network A which develops indicators for student outcomes. The set of indicators will include measures of student enrollment and achievement, labor force participation, school and school system features, attitudes and expectations, costs and resources. The first report containing data for some of these topics, Education at a Glance, was released in September 1992, and a second report, Education at a Glance II, with updated data and new indicators was released in December 1993.

Students in intact classe ; at the grade levels where the modal age was 9 and 14 years old were asked to demonstrate he w well they read and how well they understand what they read. At the same time, information was sought from teachers and schools about the factors which lead some children to become better readers than others. The populations and sample sizes varied from country to country. In the United States, the sample included approximately 10,000 fourth graders and 5,000 ninth graders from 400 schools.

The study will focus in particular on measuring issues related to curriculum and content exposure, as well as helping the U.S. measure its progress toward meeting the fourth of the national education goals. TIMSS is sponsored by the International Association for the Evaluation c Education Achievement (IEA). It is primarily designed as a study of the teaching and learning of mathematics and science. It focuses on three distinct populations of students which are defined in the United States as third and fourth graders; seventh and eighth graders, and twelfth graders. Field trials were carried out during the 1993-94 academic year, and the main data collection will occur in the spring of 1995. Data will be reported in early 1997. NCES helps to support the international coordination of the study, and is the sole supporter of the data collection in the United States, which is overseen by a National Coordinating Committee comprised of Michigan State University, the National Science Foundation, and NCES. NCES is also supporting three additional supplements to the TIMSS project to collect data designed to make the findings more relevant to policymakers. These include: (1) an opportunity for states to carry out TIMSS in their state in such a way as to compare their students' achievement with that of the world; (2) videotaped classroom observational studies of eighth-grade mathematics and science teaching in Japan, Germany, and the United States; and (3) ethnographic case studies of key educational policy topics in Japan, Germany, and the United States. When the first results from TIMSS are available in 1996, they will be used to check on progress toward the fourth national education goal regarding mathematics and science achievement. In addition to comparative findings on student achievement, three research issues that will be addressed by TIMSS are: The content and form of instruction that leads to higher achievement. The way different countries respond to student ability differences (e.g., tracking, retention, remedial programs). The values, efforts, motivation, and discipline factors that affect learning."}, {"section_title": "International Adult Literacy Survey:", "text": "The International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS) is a collaborative project designed to inform both educational and labor market policy and program development activities in participating countries. The primary objectives of the study are to: Shed light on the relationship between micro-economic variables, such as individual literacy, educational attainment, labor market participation and employment, and macro-economic issues, such as competitiveness, growth and restructuring; Identify sub-populations which are economically and socially disadvantaged by their literacy skill profiles; and Establish the comparability of assessments of adult literacy. The study includes a proficiency test based on United States definitions of literacy along three dimensions: prose literacy, document literacy, and quantitative literacy. The test framework explicitly follows the precedent set by the U.S. National Adult Literacy Survey and 103 extends the instruments into an international context. In addition, the background questionnaires provide for standard ties across countries' occupations and educational attainments. Oversight for the international portion of the study is provided by an International Steering Committee chaired by Canada with each participating country holding a seat on the committee along with representatives from the OECD, European Communities, and UNESCO. Within the United States, this project is designed to save two different purposes. For a relatively small investment on the part of the United States, we will be able to extend what we have already learned from our National Adult Literacy Survey through the addition of a set of international benchmarks which will allow us to place the existing estimates of the literacy performance of our work force in a broader context and help to characterize the literacy of our workforce compared to those in other countries. Through detailed and extensive secondary data analysis, we hope to be able to differentiate literacy profiles associated with various occupation clusters within the United States and test these associations across nations. This exploratory work could lay the groundwork for additional research and development which would ultimately lead to more refined instructional interventions for extending and developing literacy skills related to the workplace. Although the United States recently collected data on the literacy of American adults between the ages of 16 and 99, tying these data to international scales would greatly improve the utility of our existing data base. From the standpoint of assessing economic competitiveness, work force readiness, and links between schooling and the workplace, we would add to our existing knowledge a comparative component which would not otherwise be avaiiable."}, {"section_title": "Secondary Data Collection:", "text": "High School Transcript Study: Complete high school transcripts including courses taken, grades, and credits earned.

The federal authorization (enacted in 1974, but with antecedents to 1867) for these activities states that the Center will \"collect, collate, and from time to time, report full and complete statistics on the condition of education in the United States. information in an accessible manner for a general audience. The Condition, by analyzing statistical studies and data, investigated the context, resources, and performance of education in this country. In the late 1980s, the Condition became an \"indicators\" publication which includes data on a select number of topics of interest and concern in education today. All possible indicators are not published in a given edition of the Condition. Sixty indicators are presented in each year's report. They are divided into six sections: (1) Access, Participation, and Progress; (2) Achievement, Attainment, and Curriculum; (3) Economic and Other Outcomes of Education; (4) Size, Growth, and Output of Educational Institutions; (5) Climate, Classrooms, and Diversity in Educational Institutions; and (6) Human and Financial Resources of Educational Institutions. Supplemental tables and notes are also included. The indicators include a basic core that can be repeated with updated information every year, supplemented by a more limited set of indicators based on periodic or one-time studies. The indicators, therefore, represent a consensus of professional judgment on the most significant national measures o. the condition and progress of education at the time, but tempered, necessarily, by the availability of current and valid information. The concept of education indicators has gained the attention of the U.S. Congress, national organizations, states, and localities. To assist the Center in conceptualizing and developing a set of education indicators useful to policymakers and researchers, the Congress mandated that NCES convene a special study panel of experts to \"make recommendations concerning the determination of education indicators for study.\" The report of this panel, titled Digest of Education Statistics: The Digest of Education Statistics (Digest) is the primary resource publication on education statistics. It contains a wealth of information on all levels of education from preprimary through graduate education. This reference volume is intended for use by researchers, policy analysts, business, media, students, educators, and the general public. The Digest has expanded through its long history, as NCES has pursued a policy of continuous development without sacrificing important trend information. The development of the Digest occurred over an extended period of time. For 40 years, from 1916-18 to 1956-58, the statistical component of the Office of Education prepared and published the Biennial Survey of Education in the United States. Most of the important data collected by the Office was placed in the Biennial Survey, which was a resource used by researchers, planners, and others interested in the field of education statistics. After 1958, publication of the Biennial Survey ceased, but the need for a document summarizing the various types of data collected by the Office of Education continued. Thus, in 1962, the first edition of the Digest was issued. The 1993 Digest is the 29th in this series of publications. (The Digest has been issued annually except for combined editions for the years 1977-78, 1983-84, and 1985-86.) Its primary purpose is to provide a compilation of statistical information covering the broad field 128 of American education from preprimary through graduate school. The Digest includes a selection of data from many sources, both government and private, and draws especially on the results of surveys and activities carried . at by NCES. It contains a considerable amount of material tabulated exclusively for the Digest such as summaries of federal funds for education and detailed tabulations on degrees conferred by colleges and universities. The publication contains information on schools, teachers, enrollments, graduates, educational attainment, finances, federal funds for education, employment and income of graduates, libraries, and international comparisons of education. Supplemental information on population trends, attitudes on education, education characteristics of the labor force, government finances, and economic trends provides background for evaluating education data. The Digest is divided into seven chapters: (1) All Levels of Education, (2) Elementary and Secondary Education, (3) Postsecondary Education, (4) Federal Programs for Education and Related Activities, (5) Outcomes of Education, (6) International Comparisons of Education, and (7) Learning Resources and Technology. To qualify for inclusion in this publication, material must be nationwide in scope and of current interest and value. The introductory sections supplement the tabular materials in chapters 1 through 7 by providing brief overviews of current trends in American education. Each chapter contains an introduction to the statistical materials describing that sector of education, as well as a series of short paragraphs that describe the most significant data in the chapter. Charts are provided to further illuminate important data. Recently, NCES has begun a program to make the Digest even more comprehensive. To make data analysis more convenient, a machine-readable version has been developed. The  Education Facts. The data are packaged with software that allows computerized search and retrieval of specific data. NCES has also created the Mini-Digest to make basic education statistics available in a pocket-size booklet. The Mini Digest includes statistics on enrollments, expenditures, faculty, degrees, and population characteristics in an abbreviated form. The Digest strives for clarity, consistency, and comparability. It places high value on the major recurring surveys with the objective of providing trend data that researchers and policymakers can use to measure changes over time. It seeks to preserve the major series of education statistics originating with NCES and elsewhere and to make them readily available to a wide audience of users. For more information on the Digest of Education Projections of Education Statistics: The National Center for Education Statistics is the official federal sourc%. of education projections at the national level. Projections are made in the areas of: enrollments; graduates and earned degrees conferred; instructional staff; and expenditures in elementary and secondary schools and institutions of higher education. The principal publication dealing with projections is the Projections of Education Statistics. The report provides national projections of statistics about elementary and secondary schools and institutions of higher education. Included are data on enrollments, graduates, degrees, classroom teachers, and expenditures for the past 15 years, and projections for the next 12 years. The report also contains a methodology section that describes models and assumptions used to develop these projections. Most of the projections are based on three alternative sets of assumptions. Although the middle alternative is the preferred set of projections, the other (high and low) alternatives provide a range of possible outcomes. A summary of these projections is available in a pocket-sized folder called Pocket Projections. This brochure is a quick reference for projections of key education statistics. The information provided in the report is used by researchers and policy planners in education and related areas. The projections are particularly targeted for individuals in business, industry, government, the media, and educators whose work requires information on projected developments and trends affecting American education.
