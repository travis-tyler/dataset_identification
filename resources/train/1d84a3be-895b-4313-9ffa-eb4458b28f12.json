In particular, the CSF concentrations of A\u03b242, tTau, and pTau181 are useful for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, many studies have demonstrated that confounding factors related to the preanalytical processing of CSF can seriously influence measurements of these AD biomarkers. It is therefore important to develop a standardized protocol for the acquisition and handling of CSF, particularly with regard to the types of tube used for collection and storage, the proper aliquot volume, blood contamination, and the number of tube transfers and freeze-thaw cycles, because these aspects of the procedure have been shown to affect AD biomarker measurements. A survey of the impact of several individual preanalytical procedures on the measurement of AD biomarkers in CSF was conducted for this review article, and the implications of the differences among them are discussed. Furthermore, following a review of the procedures used in Korean and international biomarker laboratories, a consensus was reached among a cooperative Korean multicenter research group regarding a standardized protocol for the analysis of AD biomarkers in CSF. All efforts were made to be stringent regarding the controversial issues associated with this protocol, thus minimizing the confounding influence of various factors on current investigations using established AD biomarkers and on future studies using novel biomarkers of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "There is a significant amount of evidence to support using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers to more accurately diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD) [1] [2] [3] and AD-related mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the research setting.

[10] [11] [12] Since AD neuropathology develops much earlier than the expression of its clinical symptoms, measurement of AD biomarkers may be very useful for the early diagnosis of AD. 13 In practice, the combined ratio of A\u03b242 and tau proteins strongly predicts the progression of AD in subjects with MCI, 2, [14] [15] [16] [17] and as tau and pTau levels increase and A\u03b242 levels decrease, the progression of dementia becomes more rapid. 18 This is important because a more accurate diagnosis of AD during the early stages increases the probability of AD patients overcoming this disease. 19 In addition, the lessons learned from the failures of previous clinical trials that led to earlier administrations of potentially disease-modifying "}, {"section_title": "JCN", "text": "agents prior to the onset of clinical symptoms stand out as a major concern in current drug trials. 20 Thus, the utility of CSF biomarkers for the accurate diagnosis of AD extends beyond pure academic interest and includes a number of clinical applications.\nRecent preliminary validations performed in Korea have demonstrated that the tTau/A\u03b242 and pTau181/A\u03b242 ratios in CSF are highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of AD. 21 The trial was conducted to assess the potential of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods to measure AD biomarkers in CSF to be approved for their use from the New Health Technology Assessment of Ministry for Health, Welfare & Family Affairs of Korea (http://neca.re.kr/ nHTA/index.jsp). However, before CSF AD biomarker assays can be adopted unconditionally as a reliable tool in clinical practice, there must be a quality control program in place for the individual protocol steps to further improve the reliability and accuracy of these measurements; consistent reference and cutoff values for the AD biomarkers commonly used in Korea must also be established. International attempts to accomplish these goals began in 2009, 22 and the first step toward reducing the variability among procedures in different labs involved sharing the individual protocols to identify and removing confounding factors from the preanalytical process. [23] [24] [25] One of the main reasons interlaboratory variability persists is inconsistency in the acquisition and handling of samples. 26, 27 Thus, with the aim of establishing a standardized protocol across Korean laboratories, we have conducted a thorough review of the various confounding factors discussed in previous reports, and suggested a consensus on the individual steps for the preanalytical process related to the measurement of AD biomarkers in CSF.\nSix research centers with experience and continued interest in the analysis of AD biomarkers in CSF were involved in the creation of this consensus. The opinions of the participants were obtained regarding the individual steps of our own protocols 21, 28 and those available from international biomarker laboratories or networks, including the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; http://www.alzforum.org/sites/default/files/protocol_Biofluid_Sample_Col-lection_Protocol_for_ADNI_0.pdf; http://adni.loni.usc.edu/ wp-content/uploads/2008/07/adni2-procedures-manual. pdf), the Alzheimer's Association (AA; http://www.alzforum.org/sites/default/files/protocol_Flow_Chart_for_Lum-bar_Puncture_CSF_Processing_0.pdf), Washington University (http://www.alzforum.org/sites/default/files/protocol_ CSF_sample_collection.pdf), 29 the Alzheimer's Biomarker Standardization Initiative (ABSI), 24 the European Network for Biomarkers (ENB), 23 and the recent updates of the last two protocols, which focus on the biomarkers of AD and Parkinson's disease (PD) 25 (Table 1) . If any inconsistencies were found between current and previously used protocols, they were discussed prior to reaching the final consensus. Most of the identified inconsistencies were resolved using a set of higher standards required by more recent protocols, with the hope that the measurements of established and future candidate AD biomarkers in preserved CSF samples would not be influenced significantly.\nber of freeze-thaw cycles to one or two [23] [24] [25] (http://www.alzforum.org/protocols). Nonetheless, there is controversy concerning the extent of the susceptibility of the A\u03b242, pTau, and tau proteins in CSF to freeze-thaw cycle repetitions. A reduction in A\u03b242 levels has been observed in some studies even after the first freeze-thaw cycle, 56, 57 but not in others. 32, 58 Levels of tTau and pTau, but not A\u03b242, were altered after two and three freeze-thaw cycles, respectively, 52 but another study found that the levels of A\u03b242, pTau, and tTau did not vary significantly when freeze-thawing was repeated up to three times. 53 Instability of other CSF-related proteins has been observed in studies using proteomic methods, 52 raising concerns about potential unidentified effects on AD biomarkers.

Furthermore, if newly developed headaches or focal neurological signs are present, follow-up neuroimaging should be considered prior to performing an LP. Increased bleeding risk, low platelet count, or the use of anticoagulants would generally prohibit performing an LP, but the continuation of antiplatelet medications is not a contraindication for LP according to the ABSI protocol. 24 All procedures need to be performed by experienced physicians."}, {"section_title": "NECESSITY OF FASTING PRIOR TO LP", "text": "The review of the various protocols used by international laboratories revealed controversy regarding the issue of fasting. The ADNI and Washington University require at least 6 hours of fasting (and preferably overnight) prior to an LP, while the ABSI does not. A single Korean study indicated that fasting is mandatory, 21 but others indicated that it was not. 28, 31 Only one study involving a small number of healthy subjects has examined the effects of fasting on A\u03b2 concentrations. 32 Even though that study was performed using plasma rather than CSF, the consistency of A\u03b2 levels in CSF (irrespective of fasting) is assumed based on the results of this plasma study. 24 However, this evidence is not sufficient to clearly exclude the impact of fasting on the levels of A\u03b242, tau proteins, or future candidate biomarkers in CSF. Thus, fasting for a minimum of 6 hours (and preferably overnight) is recommended prior to an LP procedure. Furthermore, if fasting prior to CSF sampling is impossible, the time between the last meal and the LP procedure should be noted."}, {"section_title": "APPROPRIATE TIMING OF THE LP", "text": "Diurnal fluctuations in A\u03b242 levels of up to fourfold have 33 highlighting the importance of the time at which the LP required to sample the CSF is performed.

To avoid remarkable diurnal variations in A\u03b2 levels in the CSF, Washington University consistently performs LP procedures at 8:00 a.m. 33 Experimental studies using microdialysis procedures in animal models have demonstrated an enhanced clearance of brain metabolites, including A\u03b2, during sleep, 35, 36 indicating that diurnal fluctuations in protein levels are an important issue to consider. Thus, it is reasonable to recommend a consistent time range within which the LP procedure should be performed in standardized protocols. Considering the usual schedule of clinical practice in Korea, between 8:00 a.m. and noon has been suggested as a reasonable time period during which to conduct LP procedures. However, exceptions are permitted.

These differences demonstrate the necessity of consistency when using these tubes, 25, 50 especially since numerous commercially available polypropylene tubes are made of copolymers rather than pure polypropylene. 24 Accordingly, it is suggested that 15-mL sterile centrifuge tubes with a conical bottom (#352096, BD Falcon, Bedford, MA, USA; or other standardized tubes) should be used as the standard collection tube, as described previously. 21 Similarly, the standard storage tubes should be 500-\u03bcL sterile polypropylene tubes with screw caps (cat. 72.730.006 or 72.730.005, Sarstedt, N\u00fcm-brecht, Germany; or other standardized tubes), as described in the protocols from ADNI and other laboratories."}, {"section_title": "24", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "NUMBER OF CSF TRANSFERS BETWEEN TUBES", "text": "Based on concerns regarding rostrocaudal gradient-dependent variations in AD biomarkers, the Washington University protocol suggests transferring the CSF to new collection tubes following centrifugation to mix the CSF (http://www. alzforum.org/sites/default/files/protocol_CSF_sample_col-lection.pdf).

The level of a candidate biomarker for synucleinopathy, \u03b1-synuclein, is reduced by up to 40% following storage at 4\u00b0C for 4 days, 25 and analyses of this protein using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry revealed significant alterations in 6 of the 91 peaks following storage at room temperature for 4 hours. 52 Several amino acids and their metabolites are also vulnerable to decay during the time period prior to freezing, even if the delay is only 30-120 min, 54 but these changes can be mitigated by the removal of cells via centrifugation. If only A\u03b242 and tau proteins are to be analyzed, then delayed freezing may be possible, but the future validation of novel biomarkers for AD diagnosis may require shorter time delays prior to freezing, as suggested by the protocols of the ADNI, Washington University, and ENB, 23 as well as the present authors. 21 Thus, a delay of no more than 4 hours at room temperature prior to deep freezing is suggested, and it is recommended that the time period before freezing is recorded for each individual sample."}, {"section_title": "NECESSITY OF CENTRIFUGATION", "text": "The ABSI protocol recommends centrifugation only in the case of a traumatic spinal tap, 24 while the current ADNI protocol does not include centrifugation.

Moreover, additional confounding factors related to aliquot volume have been identified recently. Levels of A\u03b242, but not tTau or pTau, change significantly depending on the storage volume of the CSF samples. 55 The high hydrophobicity of A\u03b242 may increase surface adsorption to the vessel wall, but addition of the Tween-20 detergent to the initial CSF samples prior to aliquoting diminishes the adsorption of A\u03b242 into polypropylene tubes. 55 However, this manipulation step has yet to be adopted by established protocols.

The study of these markers in CSF has thus become more than just of academic interest. The general acceptance of A\u03b242, pTau, and tTau levels in CSF as biomarkers for the early diagnosis of AD was evident after their inclusion in the new diagnostic criteria for AD established by the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association. 4 With regard to the development of disease-modifying therapies in the future, the early diagnosis of AD is of prime importance for therapeutic interventions. Even before that time, the precise diagnosis of AD during the early stages is beneficial for initiating aggressive and appropriate available treatment. Currently, the measurements of pTau181 in CSF using ELISA have been accepted as a new health technology in Korea (http://neca.re.kr/nHTA/index.jsp). Although the diagnostic cutoff values for A\u03b242, pTau181, and tTau in CSF for the diagnosis of AD have been established in one Korean laboratory, 21 the direct application of these values by other institutions should be approached with caution. There is distinct interlaboratory variability in the measurement of AD biomarkers internationally among biomarker laboratories, especially for A\u03b242. 22 Standardization of the preanalytical sampling and handling protocols is necessary to ameliorate this variability (Table 2) , and its importance cannot be overemphasized. Thus, in the present article we have made a concerted effort to review, assess, and suggest the most reliable procedures for avoiding any disturbances during the preanalytic process. The analysis of AD biomarkers in CSF will hopefully be conducted under the supervision of a quality control program according to this cooperative protocol, to achieve the ultimate goal of a qualified and valid AD biomarker in CSF that can be assessed with high reliability in Korea."}, {"section_title": "Conflicts of Interest", "text": "The authors have no financial conflicts of interest."}]
