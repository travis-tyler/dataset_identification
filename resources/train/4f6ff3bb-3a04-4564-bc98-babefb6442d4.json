Hypertension may be a mechanism through which depressive symptoms influence CVD pathogenesis. 2 Prior literature has identified inconsistent longitudinal associations between depressive symptoms and blood pressure (BP). [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Longitudinal studies have typically focused on incident hypertension as an outcome, 4 ,5 including a recent meta-analysis of 9 prospective studies. 8 Few studies have examined the prospective longitudinal covariation of depressive symptoms and BP. 6, 7 There are well-documented sex and age differences for both depressive disorder (and symptoms) and BP. However, these factors are not typically examined as concomitant effect modifiers in the context of a longitudinal study of depressive symptom-BP associations. The potential importance of sex and age in moderating depressive symptom-BP associations is suggested by several findings. First, women are twice as likely as men to experience depression starting in adolescence. 9 Second, community studies have found a lower prevalence of clinical depression and depressive symptoms among elderly people than among younger adults in Western societies, 10, 11 although older adults appear to be at greater risk for depression biologically. 10 Third, the prevalence of hypertension, particularly isolated systolic hypertension, increases with age. 12 However, this age pattern differs between sexes: until age 45, more men than women have hypertension, but after age 64, more women than men have hypertension. 12 Accordingly, this study examined the potential moderating influences of sex and age on prospective relations of coincident trajectories of depressive symptoms and BP."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Participants were community-dwelling volunteers enrolled in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), a prospective open-cohort study initiated by the National Institute on Aging in 1958. 13 Volunteers return every 2-3 years to Harbor Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, for physiological and psychological testing. Beginning in 1979, participants were administered the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale. 14 Participant data were excluded from analyses after participants sustained stroke (n = 131), heart failure (n = 75), or dementia diagnoses (n = 92). Depression is a common consequence of stroke, and stroke damage to brain tissue may lead to depression. 15 Second, heart muscle is often too stiff or weak to effectively pump blood in those with heart failure. 16 Both conditions obscure the relation between BP and depressive symptoms. The final analysis sample included 2,087 participants (n = 1,095 men and 992 women) aged 19 to 97 years. Baseline sample characteristics are listed in Table 1 , and the number of participants per visit is presented in Table 2 . The BLSA uses continuous enrollment procedures, which results in participants having varied numbers of visits and followup times. On average, participants had 3.8 visits (SD = 2.6; range = 1-14 visits) and 2.3 years (SD = 1.0 years) between visits. Over the course of data collection, 628 participants died, and 382 withdrew or were lost to follow-up. Before 2002, institutional review board approval was obtained from the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. Afterward, it was obtained from the MedStar Research Institute. All procedures followed were in accordance with the appropriate institution's guidelines, and all participants provided written informed consent. Institutional review board approval for data analyses was obtained from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County."}, {"section_title": "Depressive symptoms", "text": "At each visit, participants completed the CES-D 14 as a paper and pencil inventory in a quiet room. CES-D scores of BLSA participants follow a U-shaped trajectory with age, with depressive symptom levels highest in young adulthood, with a decrease during middle adulthood, and with a subsequent increase in older adulthood. 17 The CES-D was designed for use in general population surveys to measure current depressive symptomatology levels and to examine the relation between depressive symptoms and other variables. In this 20-item questionnaire, participants rate how frequently they have experienced each item in the past week on a scale from 0 (rarely/less than 1 day) to 3 (most or all of the time/5-7 days). The domains covered include depressive mood, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, loss of appetite, sleep disturbance, and psychomotor retardation. Higher scores indicate more depressive symptoms.\nThe CES-D has been used in many population surveys to estimate prevalence rates of depressive symptoms. 18 It demonstrates strong reliability and validity for assessing depressive symptoms in the general population 14, 18, 19 and concurrent validity with other scales used to measure depressive symptoms. 14 Internal validity is strong across sex and age subgroups 14, 19 and reflects a single large higherorder factor of depression. 18 "}, {"section_title": "Blood pressure", "text": "At each visit, trained nursing staff measured brachial BP in both arms with a mercury sphygmomanometer using an appropriately sized cuff while the participant sat in an upright position.

Systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were determined by Kortokoff phase I and phase V, respectively.

Smoking was collapsed into \"ever/ never\" having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in one's life before that visit. Body mass index was calculated by dividing measured weight by measured height squared (kg/m 2 ).

Mixed-effects regression accounts for the lack of uniformity between measurement intervals both within and across participants that is present in the BLSA. 20 Mixedeffects models calculate the unique effect of each predictor adjusted for all other predictors in the model and include both fixed and random effects. Moreover, they take into account the correlation among repeated measurements on the same individual and are unaffected by randomly missing data. In all analyses, age (at each visit) was assigned as a random effect to index time. 20 McArdle and Bell 21 recommend using age to index time when participants' study entry time is random, as is the case in the BLSA. Models also included linear and quadratic main and interactive longitudinal (i.e., age) terms.\nSeparate models were constructed for SBP and DBP as the dependent measure. All analyses included age, education, and body mass index as continuous covariables, and sex, race, alcohol consumption, smoking, cardiovascular morbidity, diabetes mellitus, antihypertensive use, and antidepressant use as categorical covariables. Because CES-D scores were highly positively skewed, CES-D was log10-transformed and treated as continuous (CES-D(log)). CES-D(log) and age were centered to reduce the effects of multicollinearity in interaction terms.\nThree sets of analyses were conducted.

These models were stratified by age at first visit based on a median split (<58.8 years vs. \u226558.8 years), followed by backward elimination of nonsignificant interaction terms.

The full spectrum of depressive symptoms was examined rather than categorical depression to examine risk associated with subclinical depressive symptoms without losing statistical power. 23 Because few participants met suggested CES-D criteria (CES-D \u2265 16) 14 for clinically significant depression, results suggest that even low levels of depressive symptoms are associated with BP levels. Alternatively, these findings may also reflect individual differences in the broader and stable construct of negative affectivity, 24 rather than actual fluctuations in depressive symptoms per se, given the construct and measurement overlap between specific types of negative affect. 25 Hence, stability of depressive symptoms may in part reflect a personality characteristic and propensity to experience negative emotions. Our results further indicate the presence of complex sex and age differences in the relation of depressive symptoms to BP.\nFirst, the prospective relations of CES-D(log) to DBP differed as a function of increasing age in women (but not men) such that higher CES-D(log) was associated with lower DBP before approximately age 45 years but were thereafter associated with lesser decline in DBP. Similarly, Nabi and colleagues 6 noted a more rapid age-related increase in hypertension in those participants with more depressive episodes over time. Yet, important methodological differences between these and other available studies preclude direct comparison. In that regard, most previous longitudinal studies did not find significant interactive relations of sex 4, 5 or age 5 and depressive symptoms with respect to incident hypertension. However, whereas this study assessed the relation of concurrent depressive symptoms and BP, previous studies have assessed the effect of depressive symptoms on future BP or incident hypertension. Furthermore, whereas this study evaluated depressive symptoms and BP continuously, prior studies categorized depression and/or hypertension. 4, 5 The present findings further demonstrated that across all testing sessions, higher CES-D(log) was significantly associated with greater average SBP for women but not for men. R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and colleagues found similar results for SBP in a sample of middle-aged women over 10 years. 7 Yet, in contrast, most prior studies, albeit with differing methodologies, have noted similar results for both men and women, with greater depressive symptoms associated with higher BP. [4] [5] [6] Next, age-stratified analyses showed that across all testing sessions, greater CES-D(log) was significantly associated with both higher SBP and DBP for older adults (aged \u226558.8 years at first visit). Sex moderated the results across all testing sessions in the younger age cohort: greater CES-D(log) was associated with higher SBP in women, whereas lower levels of CES-D(log) were related to higher SBP in men. Although we could not identify any directly comparable studies, Jonas and colleagues 4 found that for initially normotensive white adults aged 25-44 years at baseline, intermediate levels of baseline depressive symptoms predicted incident hypertension; however, for those aged 45-64 years at baseline, high levels of baseline depressive symptoms predicted incident hypertension. As noted earlier, most previous studies have reported similar results for both men and women, with greater depressive symptoms predicting higher BP. [4] [5] [6] Although one prior study reported that greater depressive symptoms predicted lower BP, no sex differences were found. 3 The above findings may reflect age and sex moderation of the more stable construct of negative affectivity on BP, rather than depression per se. 24, 25 In that regard, a metaanalysis conducted by Jorgensen and colleagues 24 found that greater negative affectivity and defensiveness and lower anger-affect expression were associated with higher BP. Although not assessed here, men are more likely than women to underreport negative affect including depressive symptoms; 26 it is conceivable that defensiveness or lesser affect expression may, in part, explain the relation of lower levels of depressive symptoms to higher BP in younger men noted herein.\nSeveral similar mechanisms may underlie sex and age differences in the relations between depressive symptoms and BP. Depression and depressive symptoms are associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation and autonomic imbalance, and this altered activity may heighten risk for increased BP. 1 Women are more likely than men to become depressed in response to stressors, particularly chronic stress. 27 Additionally, women may be more likely than men to experience certain stressful events, such as work-family tensions, 28 that may chronically activate the HPA axis. Older adults may also experience unique stressors that contribute to depressive symptoms and CVD risk. 29, 30 Furthermore, stressful events occurring in late life have been associated with differential HPA axis changes as compared with early life events. 31 Second, depressive symptoms have a well-known association with inflammatory factors 32 that are posited to play a role in the development of hypertension. 33 Inflammatory processes may influence CVD development more in women than in men; 34 indeed circulating C-reactive protein levels are higher in women than in men at all ages. 34 Thus, it may be that even low levels of depressive symptoms affect inflammatory process, leading to hypertension in women more than men across the lifespan. As well, the aging process is associated with chronic low-grade systemic inflammation; 35 this age-related inflammation may put older adults at greater risk for greater depressive symptoms and BP. Moreover, agerelated arterial stiffening may leave older adults more vulnerable to the effects of depressive symptoms on BP. 36, 37 Finally, common biobehavioral risk factors such as physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and poor sleep that are associated with both depressive symptoms and CVD may have heightened effects on women than on men. 38 The attenuation of age-related decline in DBP may be a reflection of these mechanisms associated with depressive symptoms and BP (e.g., HPA dysregulation, inflammation, and biobehavioral risk factors) reducing the impact of increases in arterial stiffening with age on DBP.\nStudy limitations include the convenience sample of primarily well-educated white participants. Although the sample's homogeneity and nonrepresentative nature limits the generalizability of the study's findings, it may also limit the effects of confounding variables. Next, participants were often recommended to receive antihypertensive medication after discovery of their hypertensive status in the BLSA. It is possible that depressive symptom and BP relations differ between treated and untreated hypertensive individuals, as well as between those who were and were not adherent to antihypertensive and antidepressant treatment. 39 Additionally, some risk factors for both depressive symptoms and BP, such as sleep and physical activity, were not assessed, and smoking was assessed in a cursory manner. Finally, it is possible that the relational patterns between depression and BP may differ when using clinically defined depression (e.g., by psychiatric screening) as a predictor, rather than a larger range of depressive symptoms.\nThis study has numerous strengths as compared with previous studies. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Depressive symptoms and BP were both analyzed continuously, instead of using dichotomized groups, which allowed for observing the effect of changes in depressive symptoms on BP at a more granular level; this also results in increased power to detect an effect. 23 Additionally, this study also examined a wide age range and a balance of men and women. Finally, a large number of repeated, concurrent assessments of depressive symptoms and clinically measured BP were used, also resulting in increased power.\nThese findings indicate that that women and older adults with greater depressive symptoms are at increased risk for elevated BP, as compared with those with fewer depressive symptoms. Given the risk of CVD and mortality associated with higher BP, 40 these results make plain the importance of evaluating these effect moderators on the depressive symptoms-BP relationship, even before BP values reach hypertension level."}, {"section_title": "SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL", "text": "Supplementary materials are available at American Journal of Hypertension (http://ajh.oxfordjournals.org)."}]
