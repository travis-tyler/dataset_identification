Previous autopsy work has suggested that, in the presence of AD neuropathology, females are more susceptible to the clinical manifestation of AD. This manuscript extends that work by evaluating whether sex alters the established associations between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker levels and brain aging outcomes (hippocampal volume, cognition). Participants were drawn from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and included individuals with normal cognition (n = 348), mild cognitive impairment (n = 565), and AD (n = 185). We leveraged mixed effects regression models to assess the interaction between sex and baseline cerebrospinal fluid biomarker levels of amyloid-\u03b242 (A\u03b2-42) and total tau on cross-sectional and longitudinal brain aging outcomes. We found a significant interaction between sex and A\u03b2-42 on longitudinal hippocampal atrophy (p = 0.002), and longitudinal decline in memory (p = 0.017) and executive function (p = 0.025). Similarly, we observed an interaction between sex and total tau level on longitudinal hippocampal atrophy (p = 0.008), and longitudinal decline in executive function (p = 0.034). Women with A\u03b2-42 and total tau levels indicative of worse pathological changes showed more rapid hippocampal atrophy and cognitive decline. The sex difference was particularly pronounced among individuals with MCI, with lower education, and varied by APOE \u03b54 allele. These results suggest females may be more susceptible to the clinical manifestation of AD."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease which disproportionately affects women (Hebert et al. 2013) . Of the more than 5 million people in the United States afflicted with this disease, two-thirds are women. Although some of this difference between the sexes may be explained by women's longer life expectancies, there may also be biological factors that drive sex differences in the clinical manifestation of AD.\nIn addition to prevalence differences between the sexes, differences in the severity and progression of AD have also been documented. Compared to men with AD, women with AD perform worse on a variety of neuropsychological tasks (Henderson and Buckwalter 1994) , have smaller hippocampal volumes (Apostolova et al. 2006) , and show more total brain atrophy and temporal lobe degeneration (Hua et al. 2010) . At autopsy, women with AD have more neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles than men with AD (Barnes et al. 2005) . The clinical effects of plaques and tangles are also more readily apparent in women than men: in this same study, the relation of global AD pathology to clinical diagnosis Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

To accomplish this, we evaluated the interaction between sex and continuous measures of CSF AD biomarkers (A\u03b2-42, total tau) to test whether the association between AD biomarkers and brain aging outcomes varies by sex.

Female sex was associated with greater hippocampal atrophy and longitudinal cognitive decline in the presence of enhanced AD biomarkers. The sex difference was particularly pronounced in the presence of low education and appeared to vary by APOE genotype. These results suggest that women may be more susceptible to the downstream effects of the AD neuropathological cascade. Our primary research finding was that female sex was associated with greater left hippocampal atrophy and faster decline in memory and executive function performance in the presence of a low CSF A\u03b2-42 level (indicating higher levels of A\u03b2-42 in the brain). Similarly, we observed that females showed greater right hippocampal atrophy and longitudinal decline in executive function performance in the presence of high CSF total tau levels. This finding is consistent with autopsy reports highlighted in the introduction that demonstrated that an increase in AD pathology was associated with a greater increase in the odds of clinical AD in women compared to men (Barnes et al. 2005) . Similarly, Barnes et al. (2005) observed a tighter coupling between level of neuropathological burden and cognitive performance in women whereby women showed twice the reduction in global cognitive performance compared to men for every one unit increase in global AD pathology. Our results and the previous autopsy findings suggest that females may be more susceptible to the clinical manifestation of AD. The mechanism of the observed sex difference in the clinical manifestation of AD remains unclear, but it certainly could be driven by age-related changes in estrogen levels during older adulthood. The association between higher levels of estradiol and better cognitive performance is well established (see Luine 2014 for review), and there are some models suggesting estrogen may directly regulate levels of A\u03b2 (Anastasio 2013 ) and tau hyperphosphorylation (Alvarez-de-la-Roza et al. 2005) . Moreover, estrogen has been shown to reduce neural vulnerability to apoptosis in the presence of A\u03b2, particularly in the hippocampus (Nilsen et al. 2006) . The protective effect of estrogen in the hippocampus appears to be driven by alterations in calcium homeostasis that reduce the apoptotic response to A\u03b2. The possibility of a calcium-dependent alteration in apoptotic signaling provides potential for target candidate gene and protein analyses to assess whether alterations in genes driving calcium signaling exacerbate the observed susceptibility in females. However, additional work is needed to understand whether such estrogen mediated effects actually drive the observed sex-difference in susceptibility to the clinical manifestation of disease.\nOne interesting observation from previous work is that females with AD appear to show more rapid cognitive decline than males with AD (Tschanz et al. 2011) , likely driven by the tighter coupling of cognition and neuropathology previously highlighted. Although our primary analyses only statistically adjusted for diagnosis, we also evaluated diagnostic interactions. We observed a three-way interaction between tau, diagnosis, and sex whereby the most pronounced sex difference was among MCI participants. The three-way interaction results seem to indicate that sex differences in the clinical manifestation of disease may vary across the cognitive diagnostic spectrum, but additional longitudinal work is needed to better understand this dynamic process.\nPrevious work has also demonstrated that the APOE \u03b54 risk allele has a more potent effect in females than in males (Farrer et al. 1997) . Similarly, previous reports from ADNI suggest the largest sex difference in cognitive trajectories is observed in APOE \u03b54 carriers (Lin et al. 2015) . Our primary findings Fig. 2 Females show a faster rate of hippocampal atrophy in the presence of enhanced CSF tau levels. Figure 2 : CSF A\u03b2-42 levels are along the x-axis. Annual change in right hippocampal volume is along the y axis. Sex is differentiated by color with males in blue and females in red. The gray shading around the regression line represents the standard error covaried for APOE, suggesting that APOE is not driving the observed gender differences. However, we also observed two interesting interactions among APOE, biomarker levels, and sex. In the case of amyloid, the sex difference in the association between A\u03b2-42 levels and left hippocampal volume was most pronounced among the APOE \u03b54 carriers. In the case of tau, the sex difference in the association between total tau levels and right hippocampal volume was most pronounced among APOE \u03b54 non-carriers. Previous reports have highlighted APOE x sex interactions on brain structure and function (Sampedro et al. 2015) , indicating that the impact of APOE on neural deficits is more potent in females than in males. Our results build on this literature by reinforcing that sex differences in amyloid-related deficits in brain structure may be driven by APOE \u03b54 carriers, whereas sex differences in tau-related deficits do not appear to be driven by the APOE \u03b54 carrier effect. Additional work targeting sex differences in the molecular alterations downstream of amyloid and tau will be necessary to understand the mechanisms of the observed APOE interactions.\nEducation is another critical factor when considering sex differences in the clinical manifestation of disease. Previous work found that low education was a stronger risk factor for AD in females than in males (Launer et al. 1999) . Interestingly, we observed a modest three-way interaction between A\u03b2-42 levels, education, and sex whereby the most pronounced sex difference in the association between A\u03b2-42 and executive function was observed among those with lower levels of education.\nThe present findings provide additional evidence that females are more susceptible to the clinical manifestation of AD, particularly in the presence of enhanced AD biomarkers. However, it is difficult to conclude whether the observed sex difference is driven by differences in the etiology and pathophysiology of the AD cascade, or a more general sex-difference in susceptibility to a variety of late-life risk factors of poor brain aging. Our secondary analyses highlighting functional activities were inconclusive, but certainly a more thorough study of sex differences in the functional, cognitive, and neural changes that occur across the AD spectrum is warranted. Importantly, the results also highlight the need to pursue sex-stratified analyses of genetic risk to better assess potential sex differences in the genomic pathways that drive the clinical manifestation of disease.\nThe present results must be interpreted within the framework of our statistical models and the ADNI cohort. In all analyses, we included covariates adjusting for disease status and progression including age, diagnosis, education, and APOE \u03b54 carrier status. While we found significant sex interactions with APOE, education, and diagnosis it should be noted that the observed effects were small, and the sample sizes within contingency table cells for such 3-way interactions were limited. Future work aimed at better teasing apart these variables will be critical to understanding how sex differences in AD relate to other age-related diseases. While the ADNI cohort provides an ideal dataset to perform a comprehensive analysis of sex differences using a variety of risk factors and brain aging outcomes, it does also present some clear sample limitations. The participants have higher levels of education on average than the general population, likely have lower levels of overt cerebrovascular disease due to the Hachinski cut-off score applied during screening, and were predominantly White. Table 1 ) Moreover, many of the clinical and demographic characteristics were not matched between males and females (Table 3) , leaving open the possibility that we may not have been able to adequately adjust for confounding factors in our analyses. While there was not a statistically significant difference in conversion rates between men and women, it is interesting that men had a slightly higher rate than women. These results and previous results in autopsy samples highlight the need for a carefully matched cohort that is built to specifically evaluate sex differences in the clinical manifestation of AD. These results highlight the need for clinicians to carefully monitor patient cognition, as even early subtle changes in relatively high performing individuals may be a harbinger of future cognitive decline. If confirmed in a more carefully matched sample, the heightened association between AD biomarkers and brain aging outcomes suggests screening for AD biomarkers may be especially important in post-menopausal women when treatments become available. However, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions without a more thorough understanding of the mechanism driving the observed sex differences.\nIn conclusion, the present manuscript provides evidence of a novel sex x biomarker interaction that is consistent with previous autopsy findings and suggests that females may be more susceptible the damaging clinical effects of AD neuropathology."}]
