[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "nCOVID-19 is the name of a new respiratory disease, abbreviated from coronavirus disease 2019, while n stand for new or novel and the causative agent of this disease is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (nCOVID-19).\nCoronaviruses are a group of family-based viruses contains strains that roots potentially diseases in birds and mammals. It is the vast class of viruses that cause viral respiratory sickness extending from common cold symptoms to more severe lung diseases. In comparison to other members of coronaviruses ,which cause humans respiratory infections, SARS-CoV (first then it has spread to 216 different countries and territories all over the world, and it seems more deadly. However, nCOVID-19 is a novel strain, not identified in humans previously [1] . Coronaviruses have zoonotic origins from animals such as dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius), civet cat (Paguma larvata) and bats [2] . From their reservoirs, and worlds alarming alert, and the emergency among different countries, especially Europe, America and Asian countries draw the attention of almost every human across the globe ( Figure   2 ). This review paper shows aggregate and consolidates the most critical issues related to the virus outbreaks' origin, sources of virus transmission, signs and symptoms as well as the radiographic features from affected subjects. Additionally, it illustrates some preventive measures taken by the Saudi government that can control further spread of the SARS-CoV-2.

Based on different studies, the virus might be originated in bats [6, 7] . However, no bats were found for sale purpose at the market, which confirmed that another unknown animal might help in the transmission of the virus to humans. Many of these coronaviruses primarily infect the individual workers in direct contact with animals, as reported previously. One study recommended pangolin or snake as maybe the transitional animal as there were sold in the seafood and meat market [8, 9, 10] . Many studies explore the potential virus reservoir by comparing the sequence analysis of Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU) among different animal species based on the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence. Results suggested that SARS-CoV-2 is a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and unknown origin coronavirus that located within the viral glycoprotein spikes presented on cell surface [9] . One more research team applied algorithm for analysis of nCOVID-19 nucleotide sequencing to recognize other viruses' origins, and the results appeared that both bats and minks could be the latent host for nCOVID-19. Additionally, a study revealed that nCOVID-19 has most homogeneous genetic information with bat coronavirus and resembling snake codon usage bias [11] ."}, {"section_title": "Epidemic: SARS, MERS, EBOLA, Influenza and nCOVID-19", "text": "SARS first recognized in Guangdong, China, November 2002, and then spread to more than thirty countries which began with 8000 cases and 774 deaths. It was the first new epidemic disease in the 21 st century. The host of this epidemic disease was thought to be a civet cat; however, during seven months since the occurrence, it was under controlled [12] . (Table 1) [13, 14] . Spanish influenza was also an epidemic which its outbreak from 1918 to 1919, and it was the most devastating epidemic on record, which killed between 50 to 100 million people around the world. Several measures applied during that era, such as Fresh air, sunlight, standards hygiene and face masks in order to reduce mortality rates. Ebola virus was also an epidemic disease which first outbreaks in Ebola River, Zaire 1976. The 2013-2016 outbreaks were in Guinea then rapidly extend to West Africa with more than 10000 deaths (Table 1) . "}, {"section_title": "Spreaders", "text": "All over the world scientists are working to find out the different spreading routes of these viruses. In general, the common way is through respiratory droplets which may transfer from the patient through coughing and sneezing. Further tests have also confirmed the presence of these viruses in patients' stool, suggesting that it can be spread through the excretory product.\nCurrently, it is entirely unclear whether people can also become infected by touching contaminated surfaces or objects."}, {"section_title": "High-risk people", "text": "Older people and people with long term medical issues are more susceptible to be infected with this virus. These critical chronic health problems such as lungs diseases, sickle cell disease, liver disease, heart problems, kidney disease, cancer, high blood pressure, HIV and diabetes are more likely to get the risk of serious sickness. Pregnant women (current or recent) and the person with weak immunity are also at a higher risk of severe illness due to this virus. Additionally, smokers are at great risk of disease because smoking reduces the natural protection against this type of viruses."}, {"section_title": "Social distancing", "text": "Social distancing or self-quarantine is one of the best tools to mitigate the spread of the nCOVID-19. In 1918, two different states of America detected a few cases of influenza among civilians of Philadelphia and Saint Louis. Both of the cities were planning for a massive military parade, which was the city's largest parade ever. The head of Philadelphia city decided to continue the events which were the big reason for quickly spreading the virus and made it a worldwide pandemic. After three days, every bed in Philadelphia's hospitals were filled with sick and dying patients, infected by this deadly virus. While the head of the St. Louis city decided to cancel its parade, closed all schools, playgrounds, libraries, courtrooms and churches around the entire city; the public gathering was also banned. After a month, more than ten thousand people in Philadelphia passed-away due to flu while deaths toll at Saint-Louis was not exceed 700 cases. These precautions demonstrate the advantage of cancelling events, massgatherings and distancing social dissociation routines."}, {"section_title": "Case fatality rate CFR", "text": "The fatality cases rates are intended by dividing total deaths from a disease by the number of cases.

Most nCOVID-19 cases occurred in health care facilities; however, the routes of direct or indirect transmission of these remain unidentified. Up till now, not any specific treatment or any vaccine is available. However, serious attempts to develop preventive therapy and different researches in many laboratories are ongoing with the hope of some great findings [15] ."}, {"section_title": "nCOVID-19 or flu", "text": "nCOVID-19 has similarities and differences with flu in terms of effects and symptoms.

Carriers of this virus travelled to anywhere without any clinical check-up or incubation stay during the last three months from\nChina, Iran and Italy to the globe, which made an alarming situation of spread, severity and inaction for the world.
