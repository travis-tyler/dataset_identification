Introduction. Estimates of population density are required in basic and applied ecological research, but are difficult to obtain for many species, including some of the most critically endangered. A primary obstacle faced when estimating population density is that the number of individuals captured or detected is an unknown fraction of the actual number present, N . Capture-recapture (CR) methods yield estimates of N ; however, the effective area sampled, A e is typically unknown, and thus density cannot be estimated (Dice, 1938; Wilson and Anderson, 1985) . This is a well-known deficiency of traditional CR methods that limits their utility for making inferences beyond the indefinite region in which the sampling was conducted.\nThe limitations of traditional CR methods extend beyond their inability to estimate density. For example, even if A e were known, CR estimators can be biased by heterogeneity in capture probability resulting from unmodeled spatial variables. In particular, is it intuitive that individuals close to a trap are more likely to be captured than individuals further away. So-called spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models (Efford, 2004; Borchers and Efford, 2008; Royle and Young, 2008; Royle et al., 2009; Gardner, Royle and Wegan, 2009; Borchers, 2010 ) address these problems and produce direct estimates of density or population size for explicit spatial regions. This is accomplished by modeling the number and locations of individual activity centers as well as distance-related heterogeneity in capture probability. Information about activity centers comes from the spatial coordinates of the traps where individuals were captured -data which have always been available but were rarely utilized until recently.\nBecause SCR models overcome the limitations of CR methods without requiring additional data, they represent a major advance in efforts to estimate population density, and their use is becoming widespread. However, use of such methods requires that all individuals are uniquely identifiable, which can be difficult to achieve in practice. In some cases, such as in point counts of birds, it is typically not even possible to identify individuals. In other cases, even when resources are available to obtain individual recognition, the identity of many individuals often remains unknown. For example, in \"camera trapping\" studies (O'Connell, Nichols and Karanth, 2010) , the resulting photographs are not always sufficient for identification due to similar markings among animals. In many other cases, no natural markings are present to aid recognition (e.g., fishers, mountain lions, deer), and capturing all individuals encountered may be too difficult or intrusive.\nIn this paper, we present a model allowing for inference about density and population size when individuals cannot be uniquely identified. Our model exploits the spatial structure in observed counts induced by the spatial or-ganization of count locations that are in close proximity to one another. The key to our approach is, rather than viewing the spatial correlation as an inferential obstacle, we utilize spatial correlation as direct information about spatial distribution and population size. We formulate the model in terms of a collection of latent trap-and individual-specific encounter frequencies and provide a Bayesian analysis of the model based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We demonstrate efficacy of the approach using a simulation study. The model is also applied to a bird survey data set collected on a 50-m grid of 105 point count locations.\nOur paper challenges two ingrained and preeminent paradigms in statistical ecology: First is that sample units should be structured so as to ensure independence of the observable random variable 1 and second is that individual information is needed to obtain estimates of population size and density 2 . Our proposed class of models directly refutes both of these paradigms and suggests whole new classes of sampling designs and statistical models for making inferences about animal demographic parameters.\n2. Sampling Design. We consider a sampling design in which R traps are operated on T occasions within a region S, which for simplicity we treat as two-dimensional, S \u2282 R 2 . Although we use the term \"trap\", anything capable of recording counts of unmarked individuals could be used, such as a camera or a human observer conducting a point count, i.e., a survey from a fixed point in space. The sample occasion can be an arbitrary time period, such as a single day in a camera trap study, or a 10-min survey interval. Trap locations are characterized by the coordinates of each trap, x r = (x r1 , x r2 ); r = 1, 2, . . . , R. The data resulting from this design are the R \u00d7 T matrix of counts, n rt ; t = 1, 2, . . . , T .\nUnlike similar count-based sampling protocols, this design aims to induce correlation in the neighboring counts by organizing the trap locations sufficiently close together so that individual animals might be encountered at multiple locations. Thus, we do not make the customary assumptions that counts can be viewed as i.i.d. outcomes and that no movement occurs between sampling occasions. In the following section we develop a hierarchical model that describes the process by which such correlation is generated.\n3. The Hierarchical Model and Data. To devise an inference framework for the observed counts, we specify a hierarchical model consisting of component models for the underlying ecological state process, which in the 1 Hurlbert (1984) has been cited >5000 times according to Google scholar 2 Even classical distance sampling relies on sampling of unique individuals where identity is equated to a point in space present case are the activity centers of N individuals, and then a separate model component describing the process of encountering individuals at each trap.\n3.1. State model. Suppose that N individuals occur within S and each individual has an associated activity center around which movements occur. For many species, this could be the center of a home range or a territory. We adopt a pragmatic definition of home range to be the space about which an individual moves during a specific time period (in our case, the interval from t = 1 to t = T ). Denote the coordinates of this activity center s i = (s i1 , s i2 ); i = 1, 2, . . . , N . Since the activity centers cannot be directly observed, they are regarded as latent variables, which we model as outcomes of a spatial point process. In principle, general point process models could be considered, but here we model activity centers as\nwhich is equivalent to assuming\nif the state-space S is a B\u00d7B square. This homogeneous point process model is customary in most existing applications of SCR models Gardner, Royle and Wegan, 2009 ). We discuss a square S for simplicity only -any polygon containing x r could be used to define the state-space. In practice, it should be chosen large enough so that an individual's encounter rate is negligible if its activity center occurs on the edge of the polygon. This will depend on the specific observation model chosen (see below), and sometimes biological considerations (e.g., suitable habitat) may be used to determine S 3.2. Observation model. It is natural to regard the encounter rate of an individual as a function of the Euclidean distance between the individual's activity center and the trap location, d ir = x r \u2212 s i . To be precise about this, we let z irt be the encounter frequency of individual i in trap r during occasion t. While we will adopt the view that the variables z irt are latent variables (see below), it will be convenient to formulate the model in terms of these variables.\nTherefore, we assume that the expected encounter frequency of an individual in some trap is related to d ir as follows:\nwhere \u03bb 0 is the expected encounter rate at d = 0 and k ir is some positivevalued function of distance d ir . We assume\nwhere \u03c3 is a scale parameter related to home range size. \u03c3 also determines the degree of correlation among counts since animals with large home ranges are more likely to be detected at multiple traps relative animals with small home ranges. The phenomenon is analogous to correlation induced by averaging spatial noise, in which case there is a unique correlation between the smoothing kernel and the induced covariance function (Higdon, 2002) . We emphasize that our focus is on situations in which individuals are not uniquely identifiable, and therefore the encounter frequencies for each individual cannot be observed, and so they are latent variables. We assume that these latent variables are realizations from a Poisson distribution with mean \u03bb ir :\nIn traditional SCR models, z irt are the observed data, i.e., the frequency of encounters of individual i at trap r on replicate survey t. However, when individual identity is not known, the observed data are the sample-and trap-specific totals, aggregated over all individuals:\nThus the data required by our model are a reduced-information summary of the latent encounter histories.\nUnder the Poisson encounter model we have that\nwhere\nFurther, because \u039b r does not depend on t, we can aggregate the replicated counts, defining n r. = t n rt and then\nAs such, T and \u03bb 0 serve equivalent roles as affecting baseline encounter rate. This formulation of the model in terms of the aggregate count simplifies computations as the latent variables z irt do not need to be updated in the MCMC estimation scheme (see below). However, retaining z irt in the formulation of the model is important if some individuals are uniquely marked, in which case modifying the MCMC algorithm (see below) to include both types of data is trivial. This is because uniquely identifiable individuals produce observations of some of the z irt variables. We imagine that other observation models might be possible (see Discussion) although we focus here on the Poisson encounter model because it has considerable relevance to animal surveys, and has additional methodological context related to point process models which we address in the Discussion.\nAlthough the model is naturally described conditional on N (i.e., in terms of N latent encounter frequencies z irt ), in all practical applications N is unknown and, in fact, is the object of inference. We accommodate that N is unknown using a Bayesian estimation scheme described in the following section."}, {"section_title": "Estimation by MCMC.", "text": "We adopt a Bayesian framework for inference allowing estimation of N while retaining the formulation of the model that is conditional on the latent activity centers s i . Specifically, we employ Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to simulate posterior distributions of the parameters. However, the fact that N is unknown presents a technical challenge because the size of the parameter space can change with each MC iteration. To resolve this, we adopt the formulation of data augmentation in Royle, Dorazio and Link (2007) who used a specific prior construction for N in terms of individual level Bernoulli trials. In particular, we assume N \u223c Unif(0, M ) for some large integer M . We construct this prior by assuming N |M, \u03c6 \u223c Bin(M, \u03c6) and \u03c6 \u223c DUnif(0, 1) which implies, marginally, that N has the requisite DUnif(0, M ) distribution. However the hierarchical formulation of the prior suggests an implementation in which we introduce a set of latent indicator variables w i \u223c Bern(\u03c6) and, furthermore, the model implies that z irt are obtained from the specified distribution (Eq. 3.1) if w i = 1, or if w i = 0, z irt = 0 with probability 1. In effect, extending the model in this way induces a reparameterization for the latent counts that is a zero-inflated version of the original conditional-on-N model. Specifically, the model under data augmentation becomes\nUnder this formulation N = M i=1 w i , and population density is simply D = N/A(S) where A(S) is the area of the point process state-space S.\nWe developed two distinct MCMC implementations for this model (Supplement A). In the first, we devised an algorithm for the model conditional on the latent variables z irt . This formulation is useful for problems in which one or more individual identities are available, in which case the z irt are observable for those individuals. The unobserved z irt are easily updated using their full-conditional distribution which is multinomial with sample size n rt . The remaining parameters are updated using Metropolis-Hastings steps (see Supplement A). In the second formulation of the algorithm we applied the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to the model unconditional on the z irt variables. In that case, the marginal distribution for n rt is precisely Eq. 3.2. This algorithm is slightly more convenient because it avoids having to update the z irt variables of which there are many."}, {"section_title": "Applications.", "text": "5.1. Simulation studies. We carried out two simulation studies to evaluate the basic efficacy of the estimator. In the first study, all individuals were unmarked and we assessed posterior properties under varying degrees of correlation in the counts. In the second study, we measured the improvements in posterior precision obtained by marking a subset of the population.\nTo investigate the effects of correlation, we used a 15 \u00d7 15 trap grid and simulated scenarios with \u03c3 \u2208 (0.5, 0.75, 1.0). We selected these values because clearly \u03c3 should not be too small relative to the grid spacing or the counts are independent, i.e. the trap totals are then just i.i.d. Poisson random variables. Similarly, \u03c3 should not be too large relative to trap spacing or else again the counts become i.i.d. Poisson random variables. We note that trap spacing is widely recognized as being relevant in the application of spatial capture-recapture models, where models require observations of individuals at multiple traps, although to this point in time little formal analysis of the design problem has been done. For the other parameters in the model we considered T \u03bb 0 \u2208 (2.5, 5.0) and N \u2208 (27, 45, 75) individuals distributed on a 20 \u00d7 20 unit state-space centered over the 15 \u00d7 15 array of trap locations. This configuration implies a buffer of 3 units around the traps, which was sufficiently large to ensure that encounter rate was negligible for the values of \u03c3 considered. We fit the model to 100 datasets for each of the 18 scenarios.\nResults of our first simulation study indicate that for the small level of \u03c3, the posterior mode, if regarded as a point estimator of N , is approximately frequentist unbiased (Table 1) . However, the posterior distributions are skewed, which results in posterior means exhibiting frequentist bias on the order of 5-10%. Substantial reductions in root-mean-squared error (RMSE) are realized as effective encounter rate doubles from 2.5 to 5.0 (T=5 to T=10). Coverage is slightly less than nominal for this case. Performance of the estimator deteriorates as \u03c3 increases. For \u03c3 = 0.75 the posterior distributions are centered approximately over the data-generating value (having nearly frequentist unbiased modes), but the coverage is quite a bit less than nominal as the posterior becomes more strongly skewed. The general pattern holds for the highest level of \u03c3 = 1.0. To assess the influence of marking a subset of individuals, we used the same number and configuration of traps as described above, and we set \u03c3 = 0.5, \u03bb 0 = 0.5, N = 75, and T = 5. Then, we generated 100 datasets for m \u2208 (5, 15, 25, 35) where m is the number of marked individuals randomly sampled from the population.\nPosterior distributions of N for different numbers of marked individuals are shown in Fig. 1 . As anticipated, posterior precision increases substantially with the proportion of marked individuals. The posterior mode was approximately unbiased as a point estimator, and the root-mean squared error decreased from 19.076 when all 75 individuals were unmarked to 6.398 when 35 individuals were marked (Tables 1 and 2 ). Coverage was nominal for all values of m and posterior skew was greatly diminished (Table 2) . 5.2. Point count data. To apply our model to data collected in the field, we designed a point count study of the northern parula (Parula americana), a Neotropical-Nearctic migratory passerine. This species defends welldefined territories during the breeding season (Moldenhauer and Regelski, 1996) , and thus our modeling effort was focused on estimating the number and location of territory centers. Points were located on a 50-m grid to ensure spatial correlation. This small grid spacing contrasts with the conventional practice of spacing points by > 200 m to obtain i.i.d. counts. Figure 2 depicts the spatially-correlated counts (n r. ) from the 105 point count locations surveyed three times each during June 2006 at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Laurel Maryland, USA. A total of 226 detections were made with a maximum count of 4 during a single survey. At 38 points, no warblers were detected. All but one of the detections were of singing males, and this one observation was not included in the analysis.\nIn our analysis of the parula data, we defined the point process state-space by buffering the grid of point count locations by 250 m and used M = 300. We simulated posterior distributions using three Markov chains, each consisting of 300000 iterations after discarding the initial 10000 draws. Convergence was satisfactory, as indicated by anR statistic of < 1.02 (Gelman and Rubin, 1992) . One benefit of a Bayesian analysis is that it can accommodate prior information on the home range size and encounter rate parameters, which are readily available for many species. To illustrate, we analyzed the parula data using two sets of priors. In the first set, all priors were improper, customary non-informative priors (see Table 3 ). Uniform priors were also used in the second set, with the exception of an informative prior for the scale parameter \u03c3 \u223c Gamma(13, 10). We arrived at this prior using the methods described by Royle, K\u00e9ry and Gu\u00e9lat (2011) and published information on the warbler's home range size and detection probability (Moldenhauer and Regelski, 1996; Simons et al., 2009 ). More details on this derivation are found in Supplement A. We briefly note here that this prior includes the biologically- plausible range of values from \u03c3 suggested by the published literature. The posterior distribution for N was highly skewed with a long right tail resulting in a wide 95% credible interval (Table 3) . Nonetheless, the interval for density, D, includes estimates reported from more intensive field studies (Moldenhauer and Regelski, 1996) . This was true when considering both sets of priors, although posterior precision was higher under the informative set of priors. Specifically, the use of prior information reduced posterior density at high, biologically implausible, values of \u03c3, and hence decreased the posterior mass for low values of N (Fig. 3) .\nIn addition to estimating density, our model can be used to produce density surface maps, which are often used in applied ecological research to direct management efforts and develop hypotheses regarding the factors influencing abundance. Density surface maps can be produced by discretized the state-space and tallying the number of activity centers occurring in each pixel during each MCMC iteration. Parula density was highest near the northeastern corner of the study plot, which may correspond to important habitat features such as suitable nest site locations (Fig. 4) . We anticipate future model extensions to directly model the point process intensity using habitat covariates.\n6. Discussion. In this paper, we confronted one of the most difficult challenges faced in wildlife sampling -estimation of density in the absence of data to distinguish among individuals. To do so, we developed a novel class of spatially-explicit models that applies to spatially organized counts, where the count locations or devices are located sufficiently close together so that individuals are exposed to encounter at multiple devices. This design yields correlation in the observed counts, and this correlation proves to be informative about encounter probability parameters and hence density. We note that sample locations in count-based studies are typically not organized close together in space because conventional wisdom and standard practice dictate that independence of sample units is necessary (Hurlbert, 1984) . Our model suggests that in some cases it might be advantageous to deviate from the conventional wisdom if one is interested in direct inference about density. Of course, this is also known in the application of standard spatial capturerecapture models (Borchers and Efford, 2008) where individual identity is preserved across trap encounters, but it is seldom, if ever, considered in the design of more traditional count surveys. Our model has broad relevance to an incredible number of animal sampling problems. Our motivating problem involved bird point counts where individual identity is typically not available. The model also applies to other standard methods used to sample unmarked populations, such as camera traps or even methods that yield sign (e.g. scat, track) counts indexed by space. However, results of our simulation study reveal some important limitations of the basic estimator applied to situations in which none of the individuals can be uniquely identified. In particular, posterior distributions are highly skewed in typical small to moderate sample size situations and posterior precision is low.\nSeveral modifications of the model can lead to improved performance of the estimator. Our simulation results demonstrate that marking a subset of individuals can yield substantial increases in posterior precision. Marking a subset of individuals is commonplace is animal studies such as when a small number of individuals are radio-collared in conjunction with a countbased survey (Bartmann et al., 1987) . In many other situations a subset of individuals can be identified by natural marks alone, and thus our model could be applied to data from camera-trapping studies of species such as mountain lions, deer, coyotes for which traditional SCR methods are not effective (Kelly et al., 2008) . Thus, the ability to study partially-marked populations adds flexibility to existing SCR methods, and also creates new opportunities for designing efficient SCR studies since the costs of marking all individuals in a population can be prohibitive.\nWe note the existence of traditional approaches to combining data on marked and unmarked animals based on either the Lincoln-Peterson estimator or so-called \"mark-resight\" methods. (Bartmann et al., 1987; Minta and Mangel, 1989; McClintock and Hoeting, 2009 ). In their simplest form, mark-resight methods involve fitting standard closed-population mark-recapture models to the data on marked individuals, and the resultant estimate of detection probability (p) is used to estimate population size asN = m + u/p where m and u are the number of marked and unmarked individual, respectively.\nIn this case, the unmarked individuals provide no information about the encounter rate parameters, and thus mark-resight methods cannot be used unless a large sample of marked individuals is available. This contrasts with our approach which can be used even when all individuals are unmarked.\nIn some cases, such as in point counts of birds, it may not be practical to mark individuals. An alternative to increasing posterior precision is to utilize prior information on home range size. Indeed, extensive information on home range size has been compiled for many species in diverse habitats (e.g., DeGraaf and Yamasaki, 2001) . It is easy to embody this information in a prior distribution as we demonstrated for the parula data.\nAn additional design extension that could increase precision is to use multiple sampling methods, in which one method generates encounter frequencies and the other method generates individuality. For example, camera traps are now commonly used with surveys for sign (scat or tracks), or hair snares for sampling bear populations. These distinct methods would have different basal detection rates but share an underlying spatial model describing the organization of individuals in space. Our models show promise for using these disparate data types efficiently for estimating density.\n6.1. N -mixture models. Parallel developments which appear ostensibly orthogonal to SCR models have addressed the problem of estimating population size when individuals are unmarked. So-called N -mixture models (Royle, 2004b,a; Royle, Dawson and Bates, 2004) can be applied to a repeatedmeasures type of data structure wherein data are collected at R sites, with J replicate surveys are conducted at each. N -mixture models regard abundance at each site (N r ) as an i.i.d. realization of a discrete distribution such as the Poisson or negative binomial with expectation \u03b8. In the standard binomial N -mixture model, the observed counts are treated as binomial outcomes with N r \"trials\" and detection probability p.\nAlthough these models have proven useful for studies of factors that affect variation in abundance, interpretation of model parameters is strongly dependent on the assumption that populations are closed with respect to demographic processes and movement. The closure assumption can be an important practical limitation (but see Dail and Madsen, 2011; Chandler, Royle and King, 2011) . Furthermore the i.i.d. assumption is violated if spatial correlation exists among sites, such as if animals move among plots. Although we formulated the model developed in our paper as an extension of spatially explicit capture-recapture models, it clearly can also be viewed as a spatially explicit extension of N -mixture models where the local population sizes N r are dependent owing to the nature of the sampling design.\nThus, two recently developed methodological frameworks, spatial capturerecapture and N -mixture models, address different problems that arise in sampling animal populations. SCR models address non-closure by accommodating information on the spatial organization of individuals and juxtaposition of individuals with traps, and N -mixture models address inability to uniquely identify individuals. Our model unifies these two modeling frameworks by addressing both issues simultaneously.\n6.2. Alternative Observation Models. Several aspects of our \"spatial Nmixture model\" can be modified to accommodate alternative sampling designs or parametric distributions. We considered situations where an individual can be detected more than once at a trap during a single occasion, but under some designs this is not possible. When collecting DNA samples, for instance, an individual can often be detected at most once during an occasion, because multiple samples of biological material cannot be attributed to distinct episodes. Therefore, rather than z irt \u223c P oisson(\u03bb ir ) we have z irt \u223c Bernoulli(p ir ) where, for example, p ir = p 0 exp(\u2212d 2 ir /(2\u03c3 2 )), and p 0 is the probability of detecting an individual whose home range is centered on trap r. This Bernoulli model is a focus of ongoing investigations.\nBoth the Poisson and the Bernoulli models produce count observations when aggregated over individuals to form trap-specific totals; however, ecologists often collect so-called \"detection/non-detection\" data because it can be easier to determine if \"at least one\" individual was present rather than enumerating all individuals in a location. In this case, the underlying z irt array is the same as the above cases, but we observe y rt = I(\nwhere I is the indicator function. This \"Poisson-binary model\" is a spatially explicit extension of the model of Royle and Nichols (2003) in which the underlying abundance state is inferred from binary data. We have investigated this model to a limited extent but do not report on those results here. 6.3. Spatial point process models. Our model has some direct linkages to existing point process models. We note that the observation intensity function (i.e., corresponding to the observation locations) is a compound Gaussian kernel similar to that of the Thomas process (Thomas, 1949; M\u00f8ller and Waagepetersen, 2003, pp. 61-62) . Also, the Poisson-Gamma Convolution models (Wolpert and Ickstadt, 1998) are structurally similar (see also Higdon (1998) and Best, Ickstadt and Wolpert (2000) ). In particular, our model is such a model but with a constant basal encounter rate \u03bb 0 and unknown number and location of \"support points\", which in our case are the animal activity centers, s i . We can thus regard our model as a model for estimating the location and local density of support points in such models, which we believe could be useful in the application of convolution models. Best, Ickstadt and Wolpert (2000) devise an MCMC algorithm for the Poisson-Gamma model based on data augmentation, which is similar to the component of our algorithm for updating the z variables in the conditionalon-z formulation of the model. We emphasize that our model is distinct from these Poisson-Gamma models in that the number and location of such support points are estimated. If individuals were perfectly observable then the resulting point process of locations is clearly a standard Poisson or Binomial (fixed N ) cluster process or Neyman-Scott process. If detection is uniform over space but imperfect, then the basic process is unaffected by this random thinning. Our model can therefore be viewed formally as a Poisson (or Binomial) cluster process model but one in which the thinning is non-uniform, governed by the encounter model which dictates that thinning rate increases with distance from the observation points. In addition, our inference objective is, essentially, to estimate the number of parents in the underlying Poisson cluster process, where the observations are biased by an incomplete sampling apparatus (points in space).\nAs a model of a thinned point process, our model has much in common with classical distance sampling models (Buckland et al., 2001) . The main distinction is that our data structure does not include observed distances, although the underlying observation model is fundamentally the same as in distance sampling if there is only a single replicate sample and s i is defined as an individual's location at an instant in time. For replicate samples, our model preserves (latent) individuality across samples and traps which is not a feature of distance sampling. We note that error in measurement of distance is not a relevant consideration in our model, and we explicitly do not require the standard distance sampling assumption that the probability of detection is 1 if an individual occurs at the survey point. More importantly, distance sampling models cannot be applied to data from many of the sampling designs for which our model is relevant. For example, many rare and endangered species can only be effectively surveyed using methods such as hair snares and camera traps that do not produce distance data (O'Connell, Nichols and Karanth, 2010).\n7. Conclusion. Concerns about \"statistical independence\" have prompted ecologists to design count-based studies such that observed random variables can be regarded as i.i.d. outcomes (Hurlbert, 1984) . Interestingly, this often proves impossible in practice, and elaborate methods have been devised to model spatial dependence as a nuisance parameter. Our paper presents a modeling framework that directly confronts this view by demonstrating that spatial correlation carries information about the locations of individuals, which can be used to estimate density even when individuals are unmarked and distance-related heterogeneity exists in encounter probability.\n8.
