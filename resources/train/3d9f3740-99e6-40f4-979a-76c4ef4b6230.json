Some suggest that tauopathies play a causal role and initiate the disease process when they arise early in life [1] , whereas others posit that amyloid pathology plays a causal role arising through an independent disease process, perhaps after early tauopathies appear, and ultimately leading to an acceleration of the disease process [2, 3] . Emerging out of this literature is evidence that a subset of individuals present at autopsy with tauopathies and amyloid plaques having never shown clinical symptoms of AD during their lifetime [4] [5] [6] . Some of this work has suggested that asymptomatic individuals show acute differences in brain activity [7] and longitudinal hypertrophy in hippocampal and cortical cell bodies that may act as a potential mechanism of resilience [6] . Moreover, risk for AD pathology in asymptomatic individuals is much higher in those with a family history of AD than in those without a family history, suggesting that genetic factors may play an important role in the presence and response to AD pathology [8] . Advances in biomarker detection have led to validated measures that can be used to approximate the pathologic processes of AD in vivo including amyloid deposition imaged using positron emission tomography (PET) and levels of Ab42, tau, and phosphorylated tau (PTau) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). PET and CSF biomarkers show a strong relationship to each 1 Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.ucla.edu).

The availability of genome-wide association study (GWAS) data has led to the identification of a wide array of genetic risk factors for AD [12, 13] and associations with AD biomarkers [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Yet, no study to date has leveraged the availability of these two rich data sources to investigate individual predictors of cognitive resilience seemingly present in asymptomatic individuals. We sought to identify genetic variants that modify the relationship between biomarkers of tau pathology and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measure of disease progression-lateral ventricle dilation. The lateral ventricles have shown a strong relationship to AD onset and progression [19, 20] , and measures of ventricular dilation have been successfully applied as quantitative endophenotypes in genetic interaction analyses previously [21] . We approached this research by first characterizing the relationship between tau CSF measures and ventricular volume. Next, we performed a tau-gene interaction analysis to test whether genetic variants modified the relationship between pathology and atrophy. Finally, in post hoc analyses, we tested whether observed tau-gene interactions were associated with cognitive performance or neuroinflammatory cytokine levels."}, {"section_title": "Subjects and methods", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.ucla.edu).

"}, {"section_title": "Genetic modification of PTau-related neurodegeneration", "text": "Across diagnostic categories, increased levels of PTau were related to increased ventricular dilation, although this effect was most pronounced in the MCI diagnostic group (the diagnosis-by-PTau interaction was not statistically significant; P 5 .16). The genetic modification of this effect highlighted a subgroup of individuals who showed the strongest relationship between PTau and neurodegeneration. This effect was not driven by a low frequency of homozygous minor allele carriers as A/A allele carriers of rs4728029 made up 20% of the total sample (146 subjects), and the interaction effect was present when stratifying across the two independent data sources. Importantly, although the rs4728029 SNP did not show a strong main effect on ventricular dilation, the PTau interaction explained 2.4% of variance above and beyond known predictors of neurodegeneration including the APOE \u03b54 genotype. This highlights how the inclusion of genetic interaction effects, particularly when focusing on common variants, can improve prediction models and provide some suggestions as to the mechanisms of risk and resilience as outlined in the following.\nThe correlative nature of the present analyses precludes our ability to make definitive statements about the mechanisms of the observed interaction; however, some possible hints can be garnered from the rich data sources now available on SNP function. Rs4728029 is an intergenic SNP upstream from protection of telomeres 1 (POT1) and downstream from the metabotropic glutamate receptor 8 (GRM8). This SNP modifies three regulatory motifs and has the strongest effect on the CEBPB_known2 motif (Transfac M00201) [39] . In the case of this motif, the A allele of rs4728029 is associated with strong decrease in regulatory action, suggesting that the A allele in the present analyses may be associated with lower levels of POT1. Previous research has demonstrated that POT1 expression is related to telomere length, with lower levels of POT1 expression showing a relationship to shorter telomeres [40] , and the gene product of POT1 has demonstrated a similar relationship to telomere length [41] . Interestingly, the length of telomeres has also been associated with AD status in previous research [42] . AD patients had shorter telomeres in T cells than controls, and T-cell telomere length was inversely correlated with a serum marker of neuroinflammation. In post hoc analyses, we further investigated these possibilities by looking for similar POT1 modification of the relationship between PTau and both cognitive performance and levels of neuroinflammatory cytokines in serum."}, {"section_title": "Post hoc analyses: cognitive performance and neuroinflammation", "text": "Beyond the increased variance explained in ventricular dilation in our primary analyses, our post hoc analyses suggested that the POT1 ! PTau interaction nominally predicts cognitive performance. The rs4728029 SNP modified the relationship between PTau and memory performance, although it did not have an effect on executive function performance. If such an effect is indeed driven by the ventricular dilation observed in our primary analysis, then it is not surprising that the effect is present in relation to memory rather than executive function, particularly given the crucial memory structures that surround the lateral inferior ventricles including the hippocampus. Moreover, the observed interaction was consistent with our primary finding as A/A allele carriers showed both more dilation in the inferior lateral ventricle in relation to PTau load and poorer memory performance at baseline in relation to PTau. These two factors are, of course, highly correlated (Pearson's r 5 20.55) and, for that reason, should not be interpreted as independent signals as both are likely related to a single underlying factor. In both cases, PTau was related to dilation and memory performance in all genotype subgroups but showed the strongest relationship in the A/A group. Given the relationship between POT1 and neuroinflammatory cytokines previously mentioned [42] and the relationship between neuroinflammation and brain volume [43] , we chose to investigate whether our observed effect may be driven by such a neuroinflammatory response. Previous research has demonstrated a relationship between telomere length and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-1 [42, 44] . For this reason, we chose to focus on the TNF-a and IL cytokines available in our data set. We were underpowered to look for such gene-biomarker interactions in relation to cytokines (only available in a subsample of ADNI-1 participants), so our results should be interpreted with caution. We were able to observe a trend gene ! PTau interaction in line with our cognitive and brain volume findings as A/A allele carriers of rs4728029 showed lower levels of the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) in relation to increased levels of PTau. IL-6R has previously been suggested to be an anti-inflammatory marker [45] , and indeed, the association observed in this post hoc analysis suggests that in persons with lower levels of this anti-inflammatory marker (and possibly higher neuroinflammation), PTau leads to even higher levels of neurodegeneration. Soluble IL-6R appears to play a role in a large number of both pro-and anti-inflammatory activities mediated by IL-6 [46] , and these post hoc results must be interpreted within the many actions of the IL-6/IL-6R complex. The present results suggest that future work clarifying the relationship between PTau load, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration is warranted."}, {"section_title": "Previous GWAS of CSF markers and resilience in ADNI", "text": "Previous GWAS analyses have looked for single marker predictors of tau and PTau levels in CSF using data from ADNI. The earliest studies highlighted strong single marker effects in and around the APOE gene [18] . Although we did not use PTau as our outcome, we did verify that APOE was strongly associated with PTau (P 5 1.9 ! 10 211 ). As highlighted in our hierarchical model, the effect of APOE on left inferior lateral ventricle (LILV) slopes was more modest, particularly when including PTau in the prediction model (P 5 .013). This is consistent with the modest predictive power of APOE in relation to longitudinal change in bilateral hippocampal volume and ventricular volume reported previously [36, 47] . An additional GWAS reported a strong association between a SNP within APOE and a variety of baseline volume endophenotypes including the right hippocampus [48] . This suggests that future interaction analyses using a variety of smaller regions of interest may be warranted.\nThe most comprehensive GWAS of CSF biomarkers to date included data from ADNI and four other data sets [15] and reported a strong relationship between signals on chromosome 19 and biomarker levels. Interestingly, they also highlighted particular signals within the APOE region that are related to tau pathology independent of Ab42 pathology or clinical status. In the present manuscript, the strong relationship between PTau and APOE, along with the moderate association between APOE and ventricular volume, might explain why the strongest gene interaction effects identified do not cluster around the APOE signal. Moreover, this key difference highlights the strength of gene-biomarker interactions in identifying novel candidates for future analyses.\nIn addition, previous work by Cruchaga et al. [14] demonstrated that genetic variation associated with CSF biomarker levels can meaningfully predict disease progression. Taken together, the results of the present manuscript and both Cruchaga et al. manuscripts suggest that genetic risk factors must be considered at all stages of the AD cascade to fully elucidate the genetic etiology of late-onset AD (LOAD). Genetic variants may increase susceptibility to the primary pathologies of LOAD, to neurodegeneration in the presence of a given pathology as presented in this manuscript, or even to cognitive decline in the presence of neurodegeneration (as reported most recently by Mukherjee et al. [49] )."}, {"section_title": "Strengths and weaknesses", "text": "The present manuscript presents a novel genetic interaction approach making use of MRI, CSF, and genotyping data. Combining the two independent data sources allowed us to maximize our power to detect genetic effects, and the stratified post hoc analysis provides support for the consistency of the observed effect. The lack of consistency for some of the SNP interactions may be due to differences in the ADNI-1 and ADNI-2/GO protocols. For example, the longitudinal follow-up scans were slightly more frequent in ADNI-2/GO (approximately every 3 months vs. approximately every 6 months in ADNI-1) but covered a shorter period of time. Certainly, this longer follow-up interval in ADNI-1 could explain the cohort differences we observe, but other differences such as the distribution of diagnostic categories in the two cohorts cannot be ruled out.\nIn addition, it is possible that differences in CSF batches between ADNI-1 and ADNI-2/GO could be driving the differences in effect size between the two groups. In the present analysis, it is difficult to distinguish batch effects from group differences because we used the first CSF observation for each subject (thus the batches align roughly with ADNI-1 subjects vs. ADNI-2/GO subjects). However, it should be noted that previous work has demonstrated the test-retest reliability of the biomarker measures from CSF in the ADNI data set [31] . An additional independent sample with a longitudinal follow-up interval comparable with that of ADNI-1 could help clarify whether the cohort differences observed are simply due to longitudinal power or differences due to batch effects, MRI follow-up interval, or sample characteristics.\nOur post hoc analyses highlight a possible mechanism of the observed genetic interaction based on alterations in the neuroinflammatory response. It should be noted that these post hoc effects did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. The present project was not powered to look for all possible SNP effects across the entire proteomic panel, and the trend seen with IL-6R should be interpreted conservatively as a hint at a potential mechanism. Future functional work confirming the mechanism of the observed SNP interaction will be necessary to the underlying mechanism.\nFuture work replicating our findings in an independent sample with MRI, CSF, and genotype data is needed to confirm the observed SNP effect. To avoid possible confounding factors related to population substructure, we chose to restrict all analyses to Caucasian individuals, and thus, our results may not generalize to other ancestral populations. The statistical approach taken in the present manuscript provides a blueprint for future exploratory analyses aimed at identifying genetic modifiers of disease risk using other AD biomarkers such as amyloid load measured using PET and provides some possible targets for future functional analyses.
