[{"section_title": "", "text": "joint efforts of multiple industries (Xu, Luo, Yu, & Cao, 2020) .\nCoronaviruses are enveloped virus with a non-segmented positive sense RNA genome, the full-length genome is the largest among RNA viruses (Rota et al., 2003) .\nThe first ORF encodes a polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab, ORF1ab) and approximately occupied the first two-thirds of the genome, the remainder are structural and non-structural proteins . The pp1ab usually is hydrolyzed into 16 non-structural proteins (NSP1 ~ NSP16) by one or two papain-like protease (PLPs) in NSP3 and 3Clike protease (3CL pro ) in NSP5, to promote viral RNA replication and transcription (Fehr & Perlman, 2015; Ziebuhr, 2005) . For these non-structural proteins in pp1ab, NSP2 can inhibit two host proteins of PHB1 and PHB2, which play an important role in viral infection (Cornillez-Ty, Liao, Yates, Kuhn, & Buchmeier, 2009 ). The PLPs of NSP3 hydrolyze the N-terminal of pp1ab to NSP1 ~ NSP4, 3CL pro of NSP5 binds 11 conserved Q-S dipeptide sites in pp1ab to produce 12 mature non-structural proteins (NSP5 ~ NSP16) (Fehr & Perlman, 2015; Lei, Kusov, & Hilgenfeld, 2018) . NSP12 is a key component, also known as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and is crucial in the replication and transcription cycle of coronaviruses (Subissi et al., 2014) .\nCurrently, RdRp is considered to be the main target of antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV-2 . NSP13 owns NTPase/Helicase activity and can unwind doublestranded RNA and DNA helix (Jang, Lee, Yeo, Jeong, & Kim, 2008) . Due to the conservation of NSP13 is necessity in all coronaviruses species, it is considered an ideal target for the development of antiviral drugs for SARS-CoV (Jia et al., 2019; Shum & Tanner, 2008) . The main four structural proteins of coronaviruses are the spike protein J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (S), small envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N) (Cui, Li, & Shi, 2019) . S protein interacts with molecular receptors to mediate cell membrane fusion, allowing viruses to enter host cells (Li, 2016) . E and M proteins are involved in the assembly of the virus, which is related to the formation and release of the viral envelope, N protein plays an important role in virus replication and pathogenesis (Li, 2016; Schoeman & Fielding, 2019) .\nBased on seven conserved replicase domains in pp1ab (polyprotein-1ab) for the classification of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Sarbecovirus subgenus of the genus Betacoronavirus in the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae together with human SARS-CoV and bat various SARSr-CoVs (SARS-related CoVs), and SARS-CoV-2 is highly similar to bat coronavirus Bat-CoV-RaTG13 genetically (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses Executive, 2020; P. Zhou et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) . Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) as receptor, besides, the serine protease TMPRSS2 plays an important role in activating spike (S) protein (Hoffmann et al., 2020) . Some novel features of SARS-CoV-2 has been revealed, like a furin protease cleavage site in the Spike which may be related to viral transmissibility (Q. . Recently, a novel bat-derived coronavirus RmYN02 with the similar furin insertion in the S was found which emphasized the bat origin of the virus (H. Zhou et al., 2020) .\nAs a member of RNA virus, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) encoded by coronavirus lacks the proofreading capability, which leading to high misincorporation rate during replication even with the help of exoribonuclease like ExoN J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (Denison, Graham, Donaldson, Eckerle, & Baric, 2011) . Together with the genome recombination events, it could cause viral diversity and promote the transmission and disease of coronavirus (Hu et al., 2017) . At the same time, in order to better adapt to the host, the virus usually mutates continuously under the selection pressure of the host.\nIn particular, some non-synonymous substitution sites with high frequency are often experience strong positive selection (Pond et al., 2006) . Considering the continuous increase of infected people and the high variability of the virus, it is important to pay attention to the genomic changes of SARS-CoV-2. Recently, 7 substitution hotspots in\n) and N-GGG608_609_610AAC (N-RG203_204KR) have been reported, (Capobianchi et al., 2020; Ceraolo & Giorgi, 2020; Issa, Merhi, Panossian, Salloum, & Tokajian, 2020; . In addition, the non-synonymous substitution of ORF3a-G251V and ORF8-L84S both cause the amino acid (aa) polarity changing, which may affect the conformation of the protein and lead to function altering (Ceraolo & Giorgi, 2020) .\nDespite these recent discoveries, in order to deal with the continuous variation of SARS-CoV-2 and the accumulation of sequencing data, methods for quick and efficient well through scripts, it is difficult for biological or clinical expert without bioinformatics and programming skills. Some tools such as MutPred can analyze variations by entering amino acid sequence, but unable to handle synonymous substitutions and consecutive nucleotide mutations like dinucleotide and trinucleotide substitution (Pejaver et al., 2017) . In comparative genomic studies, it is very important to identify whether amino acid properties have changed when dealing with nonsynonymous substitutions, which can help to identify some important mutations. In this respect, we have developed an interactive analysis tool, Bioinformatics Aider V1.0 (BioAider V1.0). BioAider showed high efficiency and convenient in gene annotation and mutation screening on multiple genome-sequencing data.\nIn this research, we collected 3240 complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from 64 different countries and regions, sampling time from December 24, 2019 to April 1, 2020. We conducted a detailed genome mutation analysis using BioAider. We identified 14 substitution hotspots and 3 groups of possible linkage substitutions.\nEspecially, we found distinctive polymorphism on SR-rich region of N protein in SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses in other animals. Our work provides a new tool for recognition of the variation and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, contributes to research the replication and pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2, and gives further evidence for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2."}, {"section_title": "Working principle of fast annotation and mutation analysis in BioAider", "text": "BioAider providers a convenient function for annotation on homologous sequence.\nFirst, import the aligned complete genome sequence set, and adjust the reference sequence for gene extraction to the forefront of the sequence set.

Then BioAider can batch extract genes and annotation from a large number of sequences. Note that, the length of start string or end string is not limited in, but it is required to be unique in the reference sequence.\nSecond, for mutation analysis, BioAider will scan all the codons in the aligned sequence, using the first sequence in the data set as a reference sequence. BioAider can identify five different mutation types (synonymous, non-synonymous, insert, deletion and termination) based on the standard codon method. It can distinguish the changes in properties of amino acid when dealing non-synonymous substitutions. Then, it will locate the position of the corresponding base in the mutated codon, so it can identify multiple types of mutation at the same site, and also well discriminate dinucleotide and trinucleotide substitution. Next, it summarizes all the mutation sites with corresponding frequency and strains, and if user chooses to generate the frequency distribution of synonymous or non-synonymous sites, BioAider will directly generate the results in vector format image.

With the continuous variation of SARS-CoV-2, program tools for high-throughput analyses on big sequencing data of genome are of great importance for genomic and evolutionary studies. More importantly, simplicity of operation and high summary of analysis results could save a lot of time for researchers. Some graphic-interface bioinformatics programs, such as MEGA, DNAMAN and Geneious, are commonly used to browse or align the sequences of genes and genomes, but they are not suitable for the mutation analysis of large-scale datasets (Kearse et al., 2012; Kumar et al., 2016) . For instance, SNP-sites can screen the mutant sites in datasets of DNA sequences by sequence alignment with the reference sequence, but it cannot tell the types of those mutations (e.g. synonymous mutation or non-synonymous mutation) which are important for viral genome analyses (Page et al., 2016) . In addition, SNP-sites is a command-line program which is not friendly to users not familiar with bioinformatic programs. Another program named MutPred is capable of analyzing amino acid sequences but not nucleic acid sequences, thus it cannot reveal the variance on viral genomes (Pejaver et al., 2017) .\nHere, we present BioAider, an efficient graphical tool for mutation analysis of viral genome and could processes nucleic acid and amino acid sequence analysis in parallel.\nAfter several simple steps of operation including dataset input and parameter setup, BioAider will process the analyses automatically and outputs comprehensive and visualized graphs presenting all the information about the mutations in the input genomes, such as mutation type list (e.g. synonymous mutation, non-synonymous mutation, insertion, deletion or nonsense mutation), mutation frequency and changes in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f amino acid properties. Meanwhile, BioAider is designed for high-throughput analyses, and this interface makes it more efficient experience for the handling of bigdata.\nBioAider greatly improve the efficiency for genome variation analysis of SARS-CoV-2, contributing to the study of SARS-CoV-2 and the development of healthy smart cities.\nIn addition, BioAider harbors a built-in database of all 25 amino acid codon systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Utils/wprintgc.cgi?) and can be used for the analyses of genomes from other organisms such as bacteria and archaea. The expansion and optimization of BioAider in the future will endow the software with more functions.\nIn this study, we conducted high-resolution analysis of mutations within SARS-CoV-2 genome based on 3240 sequenced strains using BioAider. 2152 mutation sites among different strains were detected which accounted for 7.36% of the complete genome. These mutation sites included 1,335 non-synonymous substitution sites, implying abundant variations in the genome of SARS-CoV-2. However, more than half of the mutation sites were only observed in a single strain of SARS-CoV-2 which was difficult to be distinguished from sequencing errors. Considering there were only 60 sites with substitution frequency above 20. Therefore, we speculated that there were no large-scale mutations in the sequencing strains we analyzed.\nAccording to the spatial distribution analysis between strains of mutant types and referential type regarding the substitution hotspots, 12 of 14 sites showed significant distribution differences in China and outside of China, indicating different virus prevalence in the two regions and may evolve in different directions in the future. We also noticed mostly strains sampled in China were before Mar 2020, this was due to the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f epidemic of China has been roughly controlled in March. Considering these facts, we speculate that virus differentiation in and outside of China may attribute to human intervention. Besides, these non-synonymous substitution hotspots should be given more attention, they were most likely related to the phenotype of the virus. The latest study has discovered the strain with substitution of S-D614G could increases the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 (Korber et al., 2020) .\nIn SARS-CoV NSP13, the 541 th aa was critical for the protein function and double mutations of S539A/Y541A showed higher unwinding activity for nucleic acids binding (Jia et al., 2019) . The amino acid identity of NSP13 between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV was 99.83% and their tertiary structure was almost completely overlapping, indicating that NSP13 541 th aa is also a vital site for the function of SARS-CoV-2 NSP13. Notably, the mutant strain of NSP13-541C first appeared in the United States (sampled on Feb 20, 2020), and the United States was the country with the largest number and extremely high proportion of this mutant strains (316, 78% of all the 405 mutant strains with NSP13-Y541C). We also noted that there were a total of 711 strains sampled in the United States on Feb 20, 2020 and beyond, strains with NSP13-Y541C accounted for almost half of these strains in the United States. This fact indicates that NSP13-Y541C has gone through less negative selection pressure and even this variation may be beneficial. Therefore, we speculate that NSP13-Y541C improves the unwinding activity of NSP13 and promotes the replication of SARS-CoV-2, contributing to their rapid spread in the United States. However, further studies are required to reveal the detailed effect of substitution in 541 th aa of SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f and whether the possible linkage substitution site of 504 th aa plays a synergistic role in this process.\nAmong the potential linkage substitution hotspots identified in this study, ORF1ab-8517 and ORF8-251 were observed in a recent research (Ceraolo & Giorgi, 2020; Tang et al., 2020) . Among the triple linkage substitution hotspots of ORF1ab-277, ORF1ab-14144 and S-1841, ORF1ab-C2772T belongs to synonymous substitution, while ORF1ab-C14144T caused the aa change of NSP12-P323L in interface region which is a bridge section connecting NiRNA (nidovirus RdRpassociated nucleo-tidyltransferase) and Fingers of RdRp . The 614 th aa in S protein was located in the subdomain (SD) region downstream of the receptorbinding domain (RBD) on S1. We found that mutant strains with NSP12-323L & S-614G were popular in the world and owned more than half the frequency (52%) in the population, indicating that this mutant was dominant in SARS-CoV-2. However, the functional impact of linkage substitution in these two sites is still unclear at present, and whether NSP12-323 and S-614 are related on specific function needed more experimental data to verify.\nPrevious studies have reported that SR-rich region in SARS-CoV is crucial for N protein multimerization and the interaction with membrane (M) protein (He, Dobie, et al., 2004; He, Leeson, et al., 2004) . In the SR-rich region of N protein, there was only 2-aa difference between SARS-CoV-2 (referential type) and SARS-CoV. Therefore, the similar function of SR-rich region may exist in SARS-CoV-2, although there is no relevant research reported at present. Compared to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 harbors J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f one more SRXX repeat fragments in the 193 th -196 th aa of N protein. Previous research reported that the SR-rich region of SARS-CoV in 184 th -196 th aa was crucial for N protein multimerization and the deletion of this region completely would make N protein abolish the self-multimerization (He, Dobie, et al., 2004) . Besides, SRXX repeat fragments may play an important role in SARS-CoV infection (Luo et al., 2005) .\nWe noted that SARS-CoV could be regarded as a deletion of SRXX in SR-rich region compared to SARS-CoV-2, and the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than SARS-CoV, thus, whether SR-rich region of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in this process is worth to explore. However, the research about SR-rich region in coronavirus was still limited at present. Especially, unlike SARS-CoV, the region in SARS-CoV-2 is still constantly evolving, implying that the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 may employ a more flexible replication mechanism and even interaction with M protein.\nA study reported that the N protein of SARS-CoV can specifically bind to heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) A1 and plays an important role in RNA replication and transcription, especially, the key binding region is in the SR-rich region of SARS-CoV N protein (aa 161-210), the interaction between human hnRNP A1 and SARS-N protein may be the key to SARS-CoV replication and transcription (Luo et al., 2005) . Whether such a similar mechanism exists in SARS-CoV-2 is still unclear. However, in human cells, there are more than 20 hnRNPs has been discovered, and SR-rich region of SARS-CoV-2 showing distinctive polymorphism, whether the SARS-CoV-2 can bind to one of these hnRNPs needs more verification. It might provide a new hint in understanding the process of SARS-CoV-2 replication in human J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f cells. Besides, the potential phenotype changes related to nonsynonymous substitution hotspots on third SRXX repeat fragments of SARS-CoV-2 may be also worth attention.\nIn the hotspot screening, we have found several substitutions critical for viral replication potentially. For instance, the ORF1ab-C794T was located on NSP2 and NSP2 was reported to inhibit the host protein PHB1 and PHB2 which benefited viral replication, indicating that ORF1ab-C794T may affect viral replication (Cornillez-Ty et al., 2009) . The ORF3a-G171T (Q57H) was located at the transmembranous domain of the 3a protein ( Fig S2) . 3a protein was reported to form ion channels on host cell membrane and enhance the membrane permeability which benefited SARS-CoV life cycle (Minakshi, Padhan, Rehman, Hassan, & Ahmad, 2014) . Thus, ORF3a-G171T (Q57H) may affect the formation of ion channels and subsequently influence the viral replication. As for ORF3a-G752T (G251V), a recent analysis predicted that it was in an important functional domain and might be related to virulence, infectivity, ion channel formation and virus release (Issa et al., 2020) . We also found several important sites for virus entry, though they showed lower substitution frequency in our research data. For instance, S-Q675H and S-Q675R near furin cleavage region possibly influence the cleavage of RRAR, a critical step for virus entry (Fig 7) . We also detected a strain with the mutation of S-R408I located in the RBD (Table S2 ) which was reported to play an important role in virus-receptor binding by a recent study (Saha, Banerjee, Tripathi, Srivastava, & Ray, 2020) ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f BioAider greatly simplifies annotation and genome variation analysis of large-scale sequences data.
