Linear mixed effects models were used to assess changes in each measure relative to individuals' estimated years to symptom onset and to compare mutation carriers and noncarriers.\nLongitudinal \u03b2-amyloid measures changed first (starting 25 years before estimated symptom onset), followed by declines in measures of cortical metabolism (approximately 7-10 years later), then cognition and hippocampal atrophy (approximately 20 years later). There were significant differences in the estimates of CSF p-tau 181 and tau, with elevations from crosssectional estimates preceding longitudinal estimates by over 10 years; further, longitudinal estimates identified a significant decline in CSF p-tau 181 near symptom onset as opposed to continued elevations.\nThese longitudinal estimates clarify the sequence and temporal dynamics of presymptomatic pathologic changes in autosomal dominant AD, information critical to a better understanding of the disease. The pattern of biomarker changes identified here also suggests that once \u03b2-amyloidosis begins, additional pathologies may begin to develop less than 10 years later, but more than 15 years before symptom onset, an important consideration for interventions meant to alter the disease course.\nMORE ONLINE"}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Cross-sectional data from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) and other populations of autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD) have identified a relatively consistent pattern of biomarker and clinical change spanning the decades before and after expected symptom onset.

The goodness-of-fit indices suggested a change point at baseline \u22127 EYO for CSF p-tau, \u22124 EYO for cognitive composite, \u22123 EYO for hippocampal volumes, and \u22121 EYO for CDR sum of boxes (figure e-1 and table e-1, doi.org/10.5061/ dryad.f6sj385). Table 3 provides the estimate for each measure associated with time in the model with p values for the spline in EYO indicating the existence of the change points: the estimates for each outcome are shown for the asymptomatic MCs (aMCs) only and for all MCs (CDR 0 and greater).

Between the 2 measures of A\u03b2, fibrillar amyloid continuously increased across EYO (annual mean percent change) (6.1%), and CSFA\u03b2 42 demonstrated a decrease in rate of change (\u22128.8%) that slowed near symptom onset (table e-2, doi.org/10.5061/dryad.f6sj385) (figure 2). Less than 10 years after the start of A\u03b2 change, there was evidence of a decline in precuneus metabolism at \u221217 EYO (\u22121.16%). Following metabolic changes, CSF p-tau declined at \u22123 EYO (\u22129.7%), cognition also declined at \u22123 EYO (\u22120.08 standard units), hippocampal atrophy accelerated at \u22122 EYO (\u22121.4%), and CDR sum of boxes increased at 0 (0.64 boxes). Both CSF tau and p-tau in MCs showed significantly higher levels In general, the estimated rates of change were greater when including all MCs, with the exception of CSF tau and p-tau, which demonstrated a positive rate of change nearly 3 times greater for the aMCs (not statistically significant) relative to the estimates for all MCs. This suggested a greater rate of elevation of soluble tau measures prior to the onset of symptoms and a decline with the onset of cognitive decline (table 3) , whereas with most other variables the estimated rates of change remained in the same direction over the course of the disease. Importantly, the mean to SD ratio for both tau measures was the largest of all the variables that decreases the sensitivity for identifying longitudinal change. For NCs, there was evidence of an increase in precuneus FDG from \u221225 to \u221214 EYO (table e-2, doi.org/10.5061/dryad.f6sj385). Otherwise, no other annual rates of change for any biomarker in NCs were different from zero over EYO.\nTo visualize the order and rate of change over EYO for all variables together, each individual's standardized values were then used to estimate an annualized rate of change across the EYO (figure e-2, doi.org/10.5061/dryad.f6sj385) that was comparable between outcomes. In the figure, the mark on each line indicates the EYO point when the rate of change for that measure was statistically different between MCs and NCs as defined above.\nLongitudinal and cross-sectional estimates of change in MC and NC To compare the predicted change based on the longitudinal data with those based on cross-sectional data, the analyses were repeated to determine the EYO point where the means of each outcome at baseline (cross-sectional estimates) for all MCs first became statistically significant compared with NCs. We found that the order of change was relatively similar between longitudinal and cross-sectional estimates, particularly for amyloid PET, FDG PET, and hippocampal volumes (table  2 ). Yet, there were large differences in the EYO point of change (more than 10 years) for CSF measures in longitudinal vs cross-sectional estimates.

An advantage of ADAD is disease predictability, thus allowing participants who enroll at different stages of disease to be combined to model disease progression over decades. 1, 3, 19 Based on comprehensive longitudinal data in the DIAN population, we find a period of approximately 25 years where critical changes in AD biomarkers emerge, including (1) the onset of A\u03b2-related changes, starting at least 25 years before anticipated symptom onset; (2) the onset of significant changes in markers of neuronal function (i.e., precuneus metabolism) beginning approximately 17 years before anticipated symptom onset; and (3) evidence of significant neuronal functional decline (i.e., decline in cognition and accelerated hippocampal atrophy) approximately 5 years before anticipated symptom onset with a dramatic decline in CSF p-tau 181 . Importantly, these data describing within-participant changes in biomarkers offer the most comprehensive understanding of the pathobiology of ADAD to date. The results provide critical information necessary for pathology-specific prevention efforts and suggest optimal enrollment windows for targeting disease stage in ADAD (e.g., primary vs secondary vs tertiary prevention), and possibly LOAD. Based on the longitudinal data, we identified important differences in the rates and patterns of progression 1,3,23 compared with cross-sectional based estimates. First, we show that the time period between initial increase in aggregated A\u03b2 and accelerations in other biomarkers may occur at different intervals than those previously reported, 1, 24 including earlier changes in precuneus metabolism and, possibly, elevated CSF p-tau (table 2) . Further, the longitudinal estimates for some of the biomarkers indicated a more rapid change (e.g., FDG, CSF A\u03b242, and p-tau 181 ) than predicted from cross-sectional estimates, an important consideration for interventional trial design, particularly in prevention trials aimed at trying to intervene prior to the change point in specific biomarker and clinical measures. Our findings of CSF A\u03b242 and PiB-PET (fibrillar plaques) beginning to change at nearly the same time differs from some reports from non-ADAD where either measure has been demonstrated to change first. 25, 26 Yet one such study in ADNI using the same xMAP-AlzBio3 assay for CSF A\u03b21-42 found similar levels of A\u03b21-42 in PiB-negative elderly participants 25 as the NC in DIAN. This highlights the importance of also exploring longitudinal changes in order to determine the point when abnormal changes begin. Differences in populations and measurements (amyloid radiotracers and CSF) and reference regions will likely contribute to relative differences in the timing of when biomarkers change. Nonetheless, this and work in LOAD confirms that both populations demonstrate nearly the same temporal ordering of amyloid changes first, followed by other non-A\u03b2 biomarkers.

Table 4 Ordering of outcomes by estimated years to symptom onset (EYO) point where significantly different rates of change and where significant differences in the means of each outcome at baseline were identified between mutation carriers (MC) and noncarriers (NC) Second, we found that the pattern of longitudinal increases in soluble CSF tau peptides was unexpectedly modest when modeled across the disease spectrum (figure 2, G and H). This is, in part, a result of the statistical method used, which estimates change based on the entire population. The result is that the large decline in CSF p-tau for the symptomatic population influences the overall estimates across the disease spectrum. It is clear that for total tau and p-tau, the MC group has significantly higher absolute levels than NCs between 15 and 10 years before anticipated symptom onset. Yet, the rate of change for both measures in the CDR 0 group only (table  3) demonstrated an increase of nearly 3 times the annual estimated change compared to the entire cohort. Further, we confirmed previous findings in the DIAN population that CSF p-tau decreases significantly as symptom onset approaches. 27 One possible explanation for this decline is the spread of neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology and the subsequent sequestration of soluble p-tau, as suggested in transgenic animal studies 28 ; this finding is similar to the dynamics of soluble and fibrillar A\u03b2 29 previously identified. This may also explain why the largest decline in p-tau appears to occur relatively close to the onset of clinical symptoms, as postmortem studies have consistently linked NFT burden to the degree of cognitive impairment. Work in LOAD has suggested that CSF tau levels may decline with disease progression, but the changes in p-tau identified here have not yet been reported. 30 There may be nonbiological contributions to the CSF tau findings, including small numbers of participants at the extremes of EYO and limitations of the method used in this study to measure the soluble tau peptides (i.e., larger variance for both soluble tau measures compared to other variables, which limits the precision of the measurement to detect consistent intraindividual changes over time). The multisite nature of DIAN could contribute to CSF variability, but we found similar results when we restricted the assessment to a single site with the largest number of samples. Further, a recent study in ADNI reports the same direction of within-person longitudinal change in these markers in individuals diagnosed with LOAD. 31 To address this, more participants and alternative measurement techniques will likely be required.\nThird, the longitudinal estimates also provide a refinement of the trajectories of biomarker changes in ADAD and help to better understand how each might be related to the other and to disease progression. For instance, in this population, the development of fibrillar A\u03b2 pathology, once started, appears to continue to accumulate in a relatively linear fashion and preceded others. Importantly, the rates of increase of cortical PiB in the DIAN population are similar to those identified in non-ADAD populations in a number of recent studies using PiB (0.04-0.06 SUVr/year, 24 and Jack et al., 32 0.05-0.10 in the dynamic phase). However, we found evidence of a nonlinear pattern with some other biomarkers appearing to plateau (e.g., CSF A\u03b2 and tau peptides), whereas in others, there was a slower change towards a threshold, followed by a more rapid acceleration of abnormality (e.g., hippocampal volumes and cognition). This suggests that if amyloid pathology triggers other pathologies of the disease, the relationship is not a linear one, and that once a certain threshold (e.g., of amyloid burden) is exceeded, the subsequent rate of change of other biomarkers (i.e., CSF p-tau) may become autonomous and more difficult to predict how further changes in amyloid pathology will relate to further changes in nonamyloid pathologies. Similarly, predicting how lowering amyloid plaque levels will affect other biomarkers and disease progression once the pathologic thresholds have been exceeded will be challenging. This also suggests that in the case of amyloid targeting therapies, identifying the burden of amyloid pathology where other (nonamyloid) biomarkers begin to change may be critical to identifying the point of maximal benefit, rather than focusing on the levels typically separating disease vs nondisease.\nLimitations of this study include different missing data for various measures, which may influence the accuracy of each estimate. However, only approximately 15% of participants with missing data had missing data from more than one class of biomarkers (e.g., CSF and imaging), thus measures of a particular pathology (i.e., A\u03b2 or neurodegeneration) are still captured in the majority of participants. A further limitation in models that estimate change is that the model itself may introduce bias. However, the LOESS fit for the model estimated data are consistent with actual data in figure 1, indicating there is little effect of model bias. In support of robust findings, a recent publication focusing exclusively on the longitudinal imaging measures but using a different Bayesian statistical approach found results similar to ours. 33 Our choice of reference region for PET may have effects on the outcomes. However, we have recently performed an analysis in the DIAN population that compared results of longitudinal PiB when using different reference regions with and without partial volume correction 21 and found partial volume correction to be the most important determinant for longitudinal analyses. Further, our recent publication of longitudinal imaging in DIAN found no significant differences on the results when comparing different reference regions. 33 Finally, our results are dependent on the accuracy of the DIAN EYO, which is strongly associated with individual age at onset across multiple mutations. 13 Future collection of prospective disease onset will likely improve the DIAN EYO.\nRecent cross-sectional estimates of biomarker changes in the preclinical phases of ADAD and LOAD appear to support the sequence of biomarker changes based on longitudinal data from the DIAN study. However, important differences identified in this work provide the basis of a better understanding of the disease progression. Determining the period of time between initial A\u03b2 pathology and neuronal dysfunction is critical in guiding future trials aimed at disease modification and prevention. These data suggest that the therapeutic window for disease prevention and modification may begin at least 20 years before the onset of dementia symptoms and, particularly in the case of a single therapeutic target (e.g., amyloid), may begin to close within a few years prior to cognitive decline.
