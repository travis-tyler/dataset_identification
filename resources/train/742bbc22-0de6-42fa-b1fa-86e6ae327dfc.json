There is an extensive record of the intersection between eye pathologies and dementia in both the ophthalmologic and psychiatric literature (1, 2) . Visual disturbances have been described as one of the first symptoms presenting in persons with Alzheimer disease, including problems such as contrast sensitivity, visuospatial orientation, color perception, and pupil reaction (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . Macular degeneration, retinal disorders, and problems with visual acuity have also been associated with cognitive impairment in various studies (9) (10) (11) .\nAlthough often not studied, it is possible that such ocular disturbances may be precursors-not consequences-of cognitive decline. Prospective studies have shown that visual impairment predicts cognitive decline, although uncertainty remains whether treatment for visual problems could delay such decline (12) (13) (14) . In this study, we sought to address the following 2 questions: Is poor vision an etiologic contributor to dementia? Does treatment of visual disorders affect the probability of developing dementia? Using data collected prior to and after the diagnosis of dementia, we attempted to shed light on these questions."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": "Subjects were US individuals who participated in the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study, a sample from the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (15) . Only those persons who had normal cognition at baseline (i.e., during their initial Health and Retirement Study interview) were included in this investigation. Normal cognition was defined as a score of 14-35 on the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status test for self-respondents (n \u00bc 606 subjects) or a score of 1.00-3.34 on the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly for proxy respondents (n \u00bc 19) (16) . The Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status has been found to be a valid measure for assessing cognitive function (17) (18) (19) . Persons with cognitive impairment or dementia at baseline were excluded. This exclusion yielded 625 subjects who were followed for 3.5-13 years (mean, 10.1 years; median, 10.9 years) during 1992-2005 by using a retrospective cohort design."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": "Data from the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study subjects were linked to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services files (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) . Berenson Eggers Type of Service codes in the Carrier files were used to determine the types of services received. These codes were developed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to group similar types of procedures into clinical categories to enhance analyses of Medicare data. Carrier files contain claims submitted by noninstitutional providers such as physicians and physician assistants, as well as freestanding ambulatory surgical centers. Surgical eye procedures included corneal transplant, cataract removal/lens insertion, retinal detachment, treatment of retinal lesions, and others. Diagnosis codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, were used to identify disorders of the eye and adnexa (codes 360xx-379xx).\nData were also obtained regarding baseline vision during the 1992-1993 waves of the Health and Retirement Study from 606 respondents and 19 proxy respondents. Vision was measured on a 6-point scale (excellent, very good, good, fair, poor, blind); subjects who wore glasses rated their vision when using their glasses. In latter statistical analyses, the categories excellent and very good were combined to indicate ''better vision,'' with the remaining categories indicating ''worse vision.'' Information was extracted from the Health and Retirement Study regarding other potential risk factors for dementia (20) such as age; gender; race (Caucasian, African American, other); highest educational level (grades 1-11, high school, some college, college graduate, postcollege); and history of high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes mellitus, and heart disease. The number of apolipoprotein E e4 alleles was obtained from a buccal swab DNA sample; information regarding apolipoprotein E was missing for 6 participants, so best-subset regression was used to impute these values.

A diagnosis of dementia, cognitively impaired but no dementia (CIND), or normal cognition was determined by consensus of this panel. The clinical assessment began with in-home administration of multiple neuropsychological tests by a psychometrician, medical history, assessment of medication use, and current behavioral and psychiatric symptoms. A videotaped neurologic examination was also performed. The final diagnosis of dementia was based on criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (21, 22) .\nThis investigation was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Michigan and the Privacy Board at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analyses", "text": "Results were weighted to account for the sampling design of the study and therefore reflect estimates of effect for the reference population (Americans aged 71 years). For bivariate analyses of categorical data, the design-based Pearson's chi-square test was used. Cumulative incidence of dementia was estimated since change from normal cognition to dementia during a specific time period was known. Survey-weighted multinomial logistic regression was used to evaluate the relation of eye-related services and diagnoses to cognitive status (normal, CIND, dementia). For analyses of Alzheimer disease, the outcome was coded as normal, CIND, or Alzheimer disease, with exclusion of other types of dementia. Adjustment was made for age (year of birth, centered), gender, race, education, number of apolipoprotein E e4 alleles, previous head injury, diabetes mellitus, stroke, hypertension, and heart disease. The number needed to treat to prevent one case of dementia was calculated by using the fully adjusted model (covariates listed above) both for an eye procedure and a visit to an ophthalmologist. Analyses were conducted with Stata/SE 10.0 software (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas). The estimate of effect for multinomial logistic regression in Stata was calculated as a relative risk ratio, also referred to as a conditional odds ratio (23) . Alpha was set at 0.05, 2-tailed.\nBecause vision problems have been associated with injuries and accidents (24) , emergency department visits for injuries or accidents (occurring prior to the outcome) were extracted by using E codes in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Inpatient and Outpatient files. Rates of such injuries and accidents (per person-year) were calculated, as were exact P values for differences between cognitive groups.\nIn January 2002, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services initiated coverage for glaucoma screening in beneficiaries with diabetes mellitus, those with a family history of glaucoma, African Americans aged 50 years or older, and Hispanic Americans aged 65 years or older (25) .

The results not only indicate an association between poor vision and Alzheimer disease but also suggest that treatment of visual problems may affect the probability of developing Alzheimer disease. It is possible that underdiagnosis or undertreatment of visual problems in the elderly may contribute to cognitive decline.\nOur study provides evidence that the visual problems preceded the symptoms of cognitive decline. We are not alone in this supposition. In the Australian Longitudinal Study of Ageing, visual acuity significantly affected memory decline in 2,087 older individuals over a 2-year period (12) . Their data indicated that vision, not hearing, was associated with memory decline. In a prospective cohort study of 1,668 women, poor visual acuity was associated with cognitive decline measured an average of 4.4 years later (13) . Similarly, their results showed that visual impairment predicted cognitive decline to a greater extent than hearing. In a longitudinal study of 2,140 Mexican Americans, impairment of near vision predicted cognitive decline (using the MiniMental State Examination for the blind) in the 7 years after assessment (14) . In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, performance on the Benton Visual Retention Test, which measures visual perception, vision memory, and visuoconstructive abilities, was significantly predictive of Alzheimer disease up to 15 years after testing (26) . In an earlier study, this vision test predicted cognitive impairment in the 6 years prior to the onset of Alzheimer disease (27) . Moreover, in a study of autopsied patients, subjects who had poorer performance on the Benton Visual Retention Test had cerebral amyloid deposition consistent with Alzheimer disease 20 years later (28) . Specific visual disorders have been shown to share common pathogenic pathways with Alzheimer disease.\nAmyloid-b deposition was found more often in drusen of individuals with age-related macular degeneration than in those without this condition; the authors suggested a common pathophysiology (29) . Similar Alzheimer diseaserelated pathology has been found in asymptomatic elderly within the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, which controls pupillary function (30) . Furthermore, amyloid-b deposits were formed in a time-and dose-dependent manner after induction of glaucoma using an animal model (31) . Upon challenge with treatments that specifically targeted the amyloid-b pathway, significantly less retinal cell death was observed, suggesting that amyloid-b may etiologically contribute to glaucoma (31) .\nWhile some studies indicate that visual dysfunction may originate within the visual cortex, others suggest correctable problems with the eye itself. Whether treatment of specific visual disorders could alleviate cognitive decline deserves further investigation. In a study of 100 patients, memory and learning were shown to improve significantly after cataract surgery (32) . Improvement in cognition after cataract surgery was also reported in a prospective study of elderly patients in Japan (33) . However, in a study of elderly subjects with 1 year of follow-up, cognition improved for individuals with cataracts-both those with and without cataract surgery (34). Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; CIND, cognitively impaired but no dementia; RRR, relative risk ratio. a The reference group was subjects with normal cognition. Results were adjusted for age, gender, race, education, number of apolipoprotein E e4 alleles, head injury, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, stroke, and heart disease. The results of this study suggest that, whatever visual impairments existed, eye-related services may have delayed the date on which the individual met the definition of dementia. It is possible that, if visual problems and functional disabilities associated with poor vision accrued over time, an individual could meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria for Alzheimer disease and exhibit impairment in multiple domains at an earlier point in life. Moreover, the extent to which aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, and memory impairment can be adequately assessed with concomitant visual problems has not yet been fully explored.\nAncillary evidence is provided by factors reported to reduce the risk of dementia, including physical activity and mental stimulation-both of which may be impacted by visual loss. The presence of a visual disorder may impede one's mobility and affect the types of activities associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer disease, such as reading and playing board games and musical instruments (35) . Visual problems may also influence the extent of social interactions and networking; the pathology underlying Alzheimer disease has been found to be modified by social networking (36) .\nAlthough there was no significant difference in the use of glasses or contact lenses at baseline, there was an association with vision. This finding could indicate that, whatever visual disorders existed at that time, glasses could not correct for these deficiencies. Alternatively, it may indicate that the glasses being utilized by some subjects did not adequately correct problems with visual acuity (e.g., an outdated prescription). Corroborating evidence from this data set indicates that injury-related visits to the emergency room were more frequent prior to the diagnosis of dementia or CIND; prior studies have shown a strong association between poor vision and injuries/accidents (24) .\nThese findings are limited by the observational nature of the study. Specific testing for vision was not conducted at uniform intervals during the time period prior to diagnosis of dementia or CIND. Survival bias could have impacted the results of this study, although survival rates would be expected to be lower among those with poorer vision, persons who do not receive as many health services, and those with cognitive impairments. Therefore, inclusion of such subjects could pull the estimates of effect farther from the null. Furthermore, an argument could be made that cognitive impairment may have been apparent prior to the diagnosis and, therefore, patients or physicians selectively underused eye-related services because of this impairment. Several factors refute this proposition. First, the cohort was restricted to those with evidence of normal cognition at baseline. Second, there was no difference in the number of medical office visits or the use of hearing and speech services among the 3 cognitive groups. That is, patients were not underutilizing other services. Third, after dementia was diagnosed, participants were just as likely to have eyerelated services as those with normal cognition.\nWe were unable to ascertain medication use and, as such, the spectrum of various eye treatments was not adequately covered in this data set. We suspect that the stronger association between Alzheimer disease and poor vision without a prior ophthalmologist visit (RRR \u00bc 9.46) may be due to the fact that visiting an ophthalmologist may serve as a surrogate for the prescription of either an eye medication and/ or an eye procedure, whichever was appropriate for the given condition.\nOne international task force has already formally proposed including vision testing within a comprehensive consultation to prevent dementia in the elderly (37) . Since routine eye screening is not currently covered for Medicare beneficiaries, we encourage an investigation of the costeffectiveness of providing Medicare coverage for at least one vision screening for beneficiaries to postpone cognitive decline later in life.\nIn conclusion, poor vision is associated with late-life dementia. Our study results suggest that treatment of visual disorders may delay the diagnosis of dementia, particularly Alzheimer disease."}]
