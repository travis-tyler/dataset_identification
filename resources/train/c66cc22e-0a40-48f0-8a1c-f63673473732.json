[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Purpose Visual interpretation of PET [ 18 F]flutemetamol images relies on systematic review of five brain regions and is considered positive when an elevated signal is observed in at least one region. Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is an early clinical presentation of Alzheimer's disease (AD); hence it is of interest to determine if the pattern of visually read regional positivity between end-of-life (EoL) patients with and without dementia and aMCI patients is different. Methods A total of 180 EoL patients with and without dementia (mean age 81 years, range 59 to 95 years) and 232 aMCI patients (mean age 71 years, range 53 to 91 years) were scanned following intravenous administration of 185-370 MBq [ 18 F]flutemetamol. Images from both studies were read by two groups of five blinded readers who independently classified each of the five regions as either positive or negative. The majority interpretation made by at least three of the five readers was used as the imaging endpoint and compared with a composite standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) analysis using a predetermined threshold. Results Amyloid-positive images from 71 of 106 EoL patients coming to autopsy and from 97 aMCI patients were included. In the images from the EoL patients widespread deposition of amyloid was observed, with 76% of the images positive in all five regions and a further 20% positive in four regions. In the images from the aMCI patients, similar results were observed with 87% of the images positive in five regions and a further 5% positive in four regions. The mean SUVR of these positively read images was 2.24 (range 1.48 to 3.14) and 2.08 (range 1.28 to 3.04) in the autopsy and aMCI groups, respectively. There was 95.3% agreement between the visual reading and SUVR quantitation in the aMCI group and 90.4% agreement in the autopsy group. Conclusion Patients with aMCI showed a similar distribution of amyloid deposition determined by both visual reading and SUVR to that observed in patients with and without dementia coming to autopsy. Most of the aMCI patients, who are already within the AD continuum, had widespread amyloid deposition in terms of amount and topographical progression. Attempts to observe potential initial signs of amyloid deposition should focus on populations earlier in the dementia spectrum such as patients with subjective cognitive decline or even at-risk subjects with earlier stages of disease."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "F]Flutemetamol (Vizamyl\u2122) is a PET imaging agent with high affinity (Kd 6.7 nM) [1, 2] for amyloid [1, 2] whose value for the detection or exclusion of brain amyloid was studied in 831 subjects in 11 GE-sponsored clinical studies. Most of the [ 18 F]flutemetamol PET signal can be attributed to neuritic amyloid plaque. In a large cohort of over 100 autopsy patients, the sensitivity and specificity of [ F]flutemetamol by visual reading were estimated to be approximately 90% and 91%, respectively [3, 4] .\nThere is debate about the progressive deposition of amyloid within the brain and at what point the levels become (a) clinically significant and (b) visible for visual reading by currently approved methods described in product package inserts. A further research question remains whether visible amyloid appears in individual regions first, as described by Braak and Braak [5] (basal portions of the isocortex, followed by progressive and widespread deposition throughout the cortex), or whether it spreads across the neocortex at levels below the threshold for visual reading and can then subsequently be observed in a wider number of regions as, described by Thal et al. [6, 7] .\nMore recently Palmqvist et al. [8] proposed that accumulation of amyloid starts in the precuneus, and medial orbitofrontal and posterior cingulate, and linked these areas to the primary regions of the default mode network. Grothe et al. [9] have described a four-stage process starting in the temporobasal and frontomedial areas where cross-sectional amyloid deposition can show a predictable regional sequence across the whole dementia spectrum. The quantitative methods used in both studies provide better sensitivity in assessing the initial stages of amyloid deposition than the currently favoured dichotomized methods of assigning brain uptake globally as either negative or positive by visual inspection. One useful application of these newer methods is likely to be for refining the inclusion criteria of subjects with early disease included in therapeutic intervention studies.\nThe post hoc analysis presented here had three main aims: first, to assess the extent of regional visual read positivity in both an end-of-life (EoL) population (comprising patients both with and without dementia) and a younger group of patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI); second, to refine image reading methodology with this knowledge; and third to compare the majority read results from each cohort with a quantitative measure (standardized uptake value ratio, SUVR) to examine the consistency of visual reading in both populations. The data generated in this study could become valuable as the Alzheimer's disease (AD) spectrum is now recognized as ranging from those with overt clinical symptoms to those with less well-defined disease such as early aMCI and subjective cognitive decline [10] , and hence it is important to define the accuracy and utility of amyloid PET imaging in these cases."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": "Clinical cohorts used for regional read analysis Tables 1 and 2 .

Each reader recorded the frontal, lateral temporal, temporoparietal/insula and posterior cingulate/ precuneus and additionally the striatum (read region specific to [ 18 F]flutemetamol) as positive or negative for amyloid, and recorded the overall amyloid status. A scan was deemed positive if there was uptake in any one region. A scan was deemed negative if there was no uptake in all five regions.

Descriptive analysis of the data where appropriate was adequate for the assessment of the regional reads of the positive scans in both cohorts, as well as for the descriptions of the read characteristics of the clinical cases and the comparisons between visual and quantitative SUVR measures.

Most of the aMCI patients, who were already on the AD continuum, had widespread amyloid deposition in terms of amount and topographical progression. In both cohorts there were a few patients with amyloid positivity in a limited number of regions, and therefore it is important in visual image reading to systematically assess each of the five regions outlined in the [ 18 F]flutemetamol image interpretation instructions so as not to miss such cases. The image read results were also compared with quantitative SUVR results to assess the concordance between the approved method of visual image assessment which is routinely used clinically and quantitation which is more widely used in the research setting, particularly where it can be used to help resolve an equivocal image interpretation.\nSince aMCI is one of the main clinical presentations assessed in practice, the information has practical use for routine image interpretation. Currently the methods endorsed by regulations for assigning a brain as positive or negative for amyloid are via visual reading only. Results from this analysis indicate that, even in this early phase of AD, the deposition of amyloid is widespread in terms of amount and topographical progression and is consistent with the hypothesis of Villemagne et al. [16] that amyloid deposition occurs early and extensively in the AD spectrum years before the onset of major clinical symptoms. The ability to see the earliest signs of amyloid deposition would have to focus on less demented populations in the AD continuum such as those with subjective cognitive decline or those at risk even earlier in the disease course.\nAdditionally, some interesting observations were made in this analysis. Among 53 patients with an AD diagnosis recorded in the case notes, 42 (79%) showed [ 18 F]flutemetamol positivity and 21% of AD patients diagnosed with AD had a negative scan (at autopsy a number of other pathologies were recorded, for example Lewy body dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, vascular dementia and cerebral amyloid angiopathy; individual cases are discussed in [3] ). One explanation for this observation is that there is some inaccuracy in the clinical diagnosis of AD which may have been performed without biomarker guidance. In a larger cohort analysis, Beach et al. [17] similarly found discordance between a clinical diagnosis of AD and an absence of amyloid pathology at autopsy in up to 30% of patients. Additionally, in a recent meta-analysis Fantoni et al. [18] found that just over 30% of patients with a diagnosis of AD on presentation had AD ruled out by a negative amyloid PET result, and a similar figure of 29% was found by Barthel and Sabri [19] . These findings indicate that the work-up of the AD patient could be improved by the presence of biomarker data in the form of an amyloid PET scan [20] .\nFurthermore, a high percentage of patients had no evidence of cognitive disorder but did show a positive amyloid scan. These subjects were generally more than 80 years old, which is consistent with the high prevalence of amyloid in the very elderly as observed by Rowe et al. [21] and summarized by Jansen et al. [15] . An amyloid scan to support a clinical diagnosis (in particular AD rule-in) may therefore be more useful in patients showing evidence of cognitive impairment and who are younger than 80 years as per the appropriate use guidelines (one of the use categories is in early age onset dementia) [22] , though ruling out AD in an older negative case would have considerable value too.\nClinical staging of AD may be possible by applying the staging criteria for amyloid pathology progression of Thal et al. [6] . Here the stage between preclinical and clinical AD is characterized by the involvement of neocortical amyloid and the additional presence of amyloid in the striatum (Thal stage 3) . In our population of 97 aMCI patients, only two showed no [ 18 F]flutemetamol uptake in the striatum in the presence of positive uptake in other neocortical regions, so it is surmised that the hypothesis of Thal et al. would need to be tested in cohorts earlier in the AD spectrum than those in this study. Indeed, Hanseeuw et al. [23] investigated PET staging in 1,433 patients from both the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) and found that 29% (ADNI) and 12% (HABS) of the MCI patients had a negative striatal PET scan in the presence of a positive neocortical scan, pointing to a larger number of patients in this interim phase (Thal stage 3) between preclinical and clinical AD. Grothe et al. [9] have also proposed a four-stage model for characterising the systematic deposition of amyloid visualized on PET. Both models (Hanseeuw et al. [23] and Grothe et al. [9] ) appear to correlate well with cognitive decline across the dementia spectrum. The primary difference between these recent models and those of Thal et al. are that Hanseeuw et al. and Grothe et al. assessed more specifically the regional cortical stages which Thal et al. include in a higher level in their stages 1-3.\nThe inclusion of the striatum in the staging models of Thal et al. [6] , Hanseeuw et al. [23] and Grothe et al. [9] is also interesting to note, since the work of Beach et al. [24] indicates that [ 18 F]flutemetamol binds to diffuse amyloid which is the primary form of amyloid in this region. Amyloid fibrils in diffuse amyloid are less dense and hence the striatum may be an area that may show earlier signs of therapeutic efficacy when the treatment includes an antiamyloid component. A population with no striatal involvement (but cortical amyloid) may also be interesting to study for immediate conversion (and therapy intervention).\nIncidental cases of amyloid positivity, for example in the striatum only (2 of 97 aMCI patients, Table 6 ), may have been due to other less frequent clinical phenotypes such a presenilin mutation [25] , although the presence of atrophy confounding the regional reads in neocortical areas also need to be considered. It is not known whether the 2 of 97 patients in this analysis had a presenilin mutation.\nThe results of this regional analysis also have implications for the visual reading of [ For example, it is important to note that readers should not assume that all cases are either positive or negative in all five regions, but a small proportion of cases will show positivity in three, two or one region. Therefore, a systematic review of all five regions would be recommended to assign a case as either positive or negative.\nThe posterior cingulate/precuneal region has been found to be the most robust region for the visual reading of [ 18 F]flutemetamol PET scans, probably because the medial surfaces seem less prone to atrophy and also the two regions in each hemisphere are proximally located. The striatum is also an easy region to read and is specifically and uniquely highlighted in the read interpretation instructions for [ 18 F]flutemetamol as it is less susceptible to atrophy than other regions. Here the amyloid pathology is primarily in the diffuse form [24] and the striatum is a region of interest for Thal phasing as discussed above. Of the five regions inspected in the reading of [ 18 F]flutemetamol PET scans in an overall positive read, the lateral temporal lobes are read as negative most frequently. Despite being one of the original regions for CERAD, the lobes are sometimes affected by atrophy and also have the added problems of partial volume issues because of the presence of CSF and the fact that the recommended axial read plane (AC-PC plane) is not directly perpendicular to the horizontal axis of the temporal lobe. In this case, the use of anatomical CT or MRI is recommended to assist in the reading, although the lateral temporal lobes should not be considered in isolation.\nA limitation of this work is that the reading results presented here were derived from populations that are seen later in the dementia spectrum, that is aMCI and EoL patients. The EoL patients studied were originally used for measurement of the performance (sensitivity/specificity) of the tracer and included a heterogenous group of patients in whom the diagnosis was spontaneously reported in the case notes, whereas the aMCI patients were included via the consistent use of diagnostic criteria [11] . The training methodology for the visual reading of [ 18 F]flutemetamol PET scans was validated using cases from these studies [12] . More recent studies are now focusing on patients earlier in the dementia spectrum such as those with subjective cognitive decline and preclinical at-risk patients, as targeted populations for early intervention. Visual inspection methods may, therefore, need supplementing with supporting quantitative analysis [26] to increase the sensitivity in detecting early pathological changes just below the standard thresholds [27] and to improve the accuracy of reading when the cases are close to the pathological threshold where reader confidence is lower [3] or when the reader is less experienced in amyloid PET reading or does not interpret these images on a routine basis.\nIn summary, [\n18 F]flutemetamol showed a widespread topographical presence in a clinically relevant aMCI cohort as well as in a validation cohort of EoL patients. The accuracy of the tracer is high and provides a robust measure of brain amyloid that is particularly relevant for the assessment of the pathological continuum which underpins diagnostic criteria in both clinical practice and in future AD research frameworks [28] .\nFunding This study was funded by GE Healthcare.
