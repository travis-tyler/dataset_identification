[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Key Words flood pulse, fire, habitat selection, silviculture, successional habitats s Abstract Natural ecological disturbance creates habitats that are used by diverse groups of birds. In North America, these habitats or ecosystems include grasslands or prairies, shrublands, savannas, early successional forests, and floodplains. Whereas the extent of all natural habitats has diminished significantly owing to outright loss from agriculture and development, the suppression of disturbance by agents such as fire and flooding has led to further losses. Accordingly, the abundances of many bird species adapted to disturbance-mediated habitats have declined as well. In North America, these declines have been more severe and common than those of species associated with less frequently disturbed habitats such as mature or closed-canopy forests. Field studies consistently reveal the direct role of disturbance and successional processes in structuring avian habitats and communities. Conservation strategies involving the management of disturbance through some combination of flooding, application of fire, or the expression of wildfire, and use of certain types of silviculture have the potential to diversify avian habitats at the local, landscape, and regional scale. Many aspects of the disturbance ecology of birds require further research. Important questions involve associations between the intensity and frequency of disturbance and the viability of bird populations, the scale of disturbance with respect to the spatial structure of populations, and the role of natural vs. anthropogenic disturbance. The effects of disturbance and ensuing successional processes on birds are potentially long-term, and comprehensive monitoring is essential."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Disturbance was once viewed largely as an insult to the \"balance of nature\" and synonymous with habitat destruction (see Botkin 1990) . Certain forms of disturbance, however, are now held by ecologists and conservation biologists to play a fundamental and creative role in maintaining the natural heterogeneity in environmental conditions that organisms experience through space, time, or both. Much theory and empirical work has been devoted to understanding how such heterogeneity, or patchiness, affects the evolution of life histories and key ecological processes at the population, community, ecosystem, and landscape levels of organization (Connell 1978 , Pickett & White 1985 , Southwood 1988 , Alverson et al. 1994 . The importance of disturbance to the ecology of species and conservation of biodiversity has gained widespread recognition (Connell 1978 , Sousa 1984 , Pickett & White 1985 , Petraitis et al. 1989 , DeGraaf & Miller 1996a , Askins 2000 and has been defined by Pickett & White (1985, p. 7) as \"any relatively discrete event in time that disrupts ecosystem, community, or population structure and changes resources, substrate availability, or the physical environment.\"\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, a series of models appeared that related disturbance to enhanced species diversity at the local (i.e., within-patch) scale. The posited mechanism was generally the prevention of competitive dominance and equilibrial conditions either directly (through density-independent mortality of organisms) or indirectly (through changes in habitat and resource levels). Empirical evaluation of these models has been generally corroborative, but the majority of these studies have been on space-limited, sessile organisms such as barnacles, mussels, and plants (Sousa 1984) .\nMore recent works have considered the role of natural disturbance on species diversity at the landscape or regional scale (Angelstam 1998 , Askins 2000 . Now, disturbance is viewed as a natural ecological process leading to a mosaic of habitats or successional stages that may enhance both \u03b1 and \u03b2 diversity (Anglestam 1998). Indeed, ecological disturbance is an assumption in models that consider spatially structured populations. Depending on the scale of disturbance and the scale at which an organism \"perceives\" the environment (Vos et al. 2001) , natural and, increasingly, anthropogenic disturbance can form the landscape framework for metapopulations and source-sink dynamics (Hanski 1991 , Dunning et al. 1992 . At a more evolutionary time-scale, the frequency of habitat disturbance has been hypothesized as the source of selective pressure underlying the evolution of dispersal strategies and other key life-history traits (Southwood 1988) . In restoration ecology, landscape ecology, and the concept of ecosystem management, natural disturbance is now generally recognized as essential for maintaining biodiversity (Alverson et al. 1994 , Askins 2000 . Direct application of disturbance (e.g., prescribed burning or silviculture) or allowing the natural agents of disturbance (e.g., wildfire or floods) to proceed, are becoming standard elements of local and regional conservation strategies (Johnson et al. 1998 ). This paper reviews how natural and anthropogenic disturbance can affect the population and community ecology of birds, and it emphasizes the conservation implications of these effects. The motivation for this review is twofold. First, the ecology of disturbance with relatively mobile organisms is different, but less well understood, than that for sessile organisms (Sousa 1984) . Second, evidence is growing that some form of disturbance is required by the habitat needs of a large segment of the world's terrestrial avifauna (Askins 2000) . Much has been written on the loss and fragmentation of closed-canopy forests due to agriculture or urbanization (e.g., , but less study has been devoted to the role of managing ecosystems and successional processes through the application of disturbance. We limit our review to bird species associated with terrestrial habitats or ecosystems and emphasize species that breed in North America. Finally, we feature the major agents of disturbance that we believe are most relevant to land-use policy or options for avian conservation: fire, silviculture, and floodplain dynamics. Silviculture stands apart as a commercially driven source of habitat disturbance; however, its effects are pervasive and potentially creative. Other important agents of disturbance in terrestrial avian habitats include drought, hurricanes, and herbivory owing to insect outbreaks or mammals (Rotenberry et al. 1995, R. A. Askins, personal communication) ."}, {"section_title": "GENERAL BACKGROUND", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Habitat Ecology of Birds", "text": "The proximate cues used by birds to discriminate among habitats probably include factors that influence the availability of food, risk of predation (to adults or nests), and availability of nest sites. These factors include vegetation structure, floristic composition, densities of conspecifics and heterospecifics, and microclimate (Hild\u00e9n 1965 , James 1971 , Hutto 1985 , Block & Brennan 1993 , Martin 1998 ). Cues at the landscape or regional scale may include the size, shape, distribution, configuration, and connectedness of different patch types (Wiens et al. 1993) . Disturbance likely affects all aspects of avian habitat quality and selection from the microhabitat to regional scale."}, {"section_title": "Conservation Status of Species in Disturbance-Mediated Habitats and Ecosystems", "text": "In a review of the conservation status of birds of eastern North America, Askins (1993) reported a significantly greater proportion of recent declines in estimated abundances for species most often associated with disturbance (grasslands, shrubland, or savannas) than with forest birds (also see Peterjohn & Sauer 1999) . Estimates of trends in abundances were derived from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), a continental avian survey program that was initiated in 1966 (Sauer et al. 2000) . We expanded the comparative approach of Askins (1993) to consider all native North American terrestrial species for which abundance trends from 1966 to 1998 could be estimated with reasonable precision. We included 274 species and placed each into one of five habitat categories: grassland (n = 27), shrub-scrub (n = 79), open woodlands and savanna (n = 63), closed-canopy forest (deciduous, coniferous, or mixed, n = 77), and generalist (n = 28). The last category was used for species associated with two or more categories over all or part of their range and species of urban or suburban habitats. We then consulted Sauer et al. (2000) for estimates of population trends. The significance of these estimated trends are placed by Sauer et al. (2000) into four categories: significant (p < 0.10), upward, or downward, and insignificant (p > 0.10), upward, or downward.\nThe distribution of species in the four trend categories varied significantly among the different habitats or ecosystems (p = .0004, exact test of proportions). A greater proportion of species experienced significant decreases in all disturbancemediated habitats than in the forested or generalist categories (Figure 1 ). The greatest proportion of decreases was within grassland birds where 56% of species in our sample declined significantly, followed by shrub-scrub (39%), and open woodlands (33%). Combining these three categories into a general \"disturbance\" category revealed that 40% (n = 169) of North American species associated with Figure 1 Status of North American birds in five habitat groups with respect to trends in abundance from . Trends from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (see text for explanation of survey, how species were assigned to habitat groups, and how trends were estimated and significance was determined). some type of disturbance-mediated habitats were significantly decreasing between 1966 and 1998. Conversely, only 17% of the disturbance species experienced significant increases, whereas 34% of the forest species in our sample significantly increased."}, {"section_title": "EFFECTS OF FIRE", "text": "Under natural conditions, fire is the major force that governs the development and function of most deciduous, coniferous, and mixed forest types at temperate latitudes (Wright & Bailey 1982 , Attiwill 1994 , Frost 1998 . Fire, along with other factors, is key in maintaining entire ecosystems such as grasslands and savannas at temperate and tropical latitudes, and Mediterranean-type shrublands (Moreno & Oechel 1994 , McPherson 1997 . In an extensive analysis of pre-European settlement forests in the United States, Frost (1998) found that fire played a fundamental role in the structure and composition of all but the wettest, most arid, or fire-sheltered forest types. The estimated fire frequency from lightning strikes and Native Americans varied from 1 to 700 y; one half of the continental United States burned every 1 to 12 y. Other historical analyses of forests worldwide have also identified the pervasive role of fire on landscape diversity and the composition, structure, and function of stands (Atiwill 1994 , Angelstam 1998 .\nSuppression of fire and longer intervals between fires have emerged over the past 150 y in nearly all human dominated ecosystems and habitats where fire was a factor historically (Frost 1998 , Smith 2000 . Prescribed fire as a means of restoring or maintaining biodiversity is becoming commonplace throughout North America and elsewhere (Askins 2000), but long-term studies of periodic fire and birds are few. We review four case histories: coniferous and boreal forests of the western United States and southern Canada, oak savannas of the Midwestern United States, pine savannas of the southeastern United States, and North American grasslands. Other important systems in which fire has known effects on birds include shrubsteppe in the Western United States (Knick & Rotenberry 1999) , diverse Australian ecosystems (Reilly 1991) , Mediterranen-type ecosystems (Moreno & Oechel 1994) , and Cerrado in Brazil (Cavalcanti 1999) ."}, {"section_title": "Coniferous and Boreal Forests of the Western United States and Southern Canada", "text": "The conifer-dominated forests of the western United States are variable in species composition and include ecoregions (sensu Ricketts et al. 1999 ) that are geographically widespread. The ecoregions include: Sierra Forests dominated by mixedconifer stands (Ricketts et al. 1999) ; Rocky Mountain Forests (split by Ricketts et al. 1999 into several regions) dominated at different elevations by ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), spruces (Picea spp.), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), and firs (Abies spp.); and mid-elevation forest in the southwest dominated by ponderosa pine. Fire was a common disturbance in these forests; estimates range from 1 per 10 to 300 y (Telfer 2000), with stand replacement fires more common in mixed-conifer forests at relatively high elevations. Historically, replacement fires were uncommon in open ponderosa pine forests (Telfer 2000) . Boreal forests are most extensive in southern Canada, with elements found in northern sections of the continental United States. These forests-dominated by spruce, jack pine (Pinus banksiata), and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides)-experience relatively frequent stand-replacing fires that occur every 40 to 100 y (Telfer 2000) .\nThe effects of fire on birds in these ecoregions are comparatively well known (Bock et al. 1978 , Raphael et al. 1987 . The most celebrated case history is the dependence of the Kirtland's Warbler (Dendroica kirtlandii) on burned jackpine habitat (Probst & Weinrich 1993) . Hutto (1995) examined effects of stand replacing fires on breeding bird communities in coniferous forests of the Northern Rocky Mountain Forests. Fifteen species of birds were markedly more common on recently (i.e., within 1-3 y) burned habitats than in nearly all the other forest types and successional stages sampled in the region. The Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) was largely restricted to the recently burned stands (1-2 y after fire). Overall avian community structure was distinctive in burned sites (either 1-2 y or 10-40 y after fire) largely because of greater densities of woodpeckers, flycatchers, or granivorous species. An open stand with many snags (i.e., dead or dying trees) and open ground provides for the nesting and foraging requirements of these species. Other studies in mixed-coniferous forests confirm that cavitynesting birds in particular benefit from the action of fire disturbance that creates nesting foraging substrate in snags (Caton 1998) .\nInformation on the effects of wildfire and prescribed fire on birds in southwestern ponderosa pine forests, although hampered by a lack of long-term replicated studies (Finch et al. 1997) , indicates that several species benefit from disturbance. And in many cases, these are the same species or species groups that respond positively to disturbance in mixed-conifer burns (summarized in Finch et al. 1997) . Populations of woodpeckers, certain flycatchers, and certain ground foragers tend to increase after fire.\nBoreal forests in southern Canada have provided opportunities to assess the effects of natural burn cycles. As with mixed-conifer sites, stand-replacement burns host distinctive bird communities from the time of initial burns and succession from brush/shrub to relatively mature forest (Helle & Neimi 1996 , Imbeau et al. 1999 , Drapeau et al. 2000 , Schieck & Hobson 2000 . Virtually all studies have observed enhanced \u03b2 diversity with fire disturbance and greater landscape diversity. The Black-backed Woodpecker, in particular, is a specialist in recent burns (Bock & Bock 1974 ). This species forages on wood-boring beetles that inhabit dying conifers for 2-3 y after exposure to fire (Murphy & Lehnhausen 1998) ."}, {"section_title": "Midwestern Oak Savannas and Woodlands", "text": "Oak savannas and woodlands were formerly a significant element of the landscapes of the midwestern United States and Canada that covered an estimated 11\u00d710 6 ha (Nuzzo 1986 1999) . Fire was the primary disturbance force in the region, and savannas burned less frequently than prairies, but more often than areas of forest.\nBecause of development and lack of disturbance, only 1% of the former oak savannas in the Midwest remain, and this habitat type is judged as globally significant (Ricketts et al. 1999 ). With fire suppression, shaded conditions develop, the herbaceous understory is lost, and encroachment by mesophytic species such as maples (Acer spp.) occurs (Packard 1993) . Accordingly, prescribed fire, mechanical cutting, and herbiciding for the control of exotics are now common throughout the region in an effort to restore degraded savannas or maintain an open canopy (Packard 1993) . Extant savannas in the upper Midwest are characteristically small, isolated remnants (Temple 1998) .\nStudies of birds and oak savannas have emphasized within-patch effects of prescribed burning. Overall, it is clear that bird communities of oak savanna reflect the transitional status of this vegetation type. Temple (1998) concluded that most bird species characteristic of oak savannas also have affinities with either prairies or forests. In the midwestern United States, this group includes about 40 bird species; of these, about 60% are decreasing significantly in the region (Brawn 1994) . Whereas Temple (1998) concluded that there are no true savanna birds in the Midwest, one possible exception may be the Red-headed Woodpecker (Melanerpes erythocephalus)-a species that is decreasing throughout much of its range (Sauer et al. 2000) . In Illinois' upland habitats, this species is restricted to oak savannas and habitats that mimic savannas such as parks (J. D. Brawn, unpublished data).\nBird communities in oak forest in the upper Midwest change with fire and savanna restoration. Davis et al. (2000) reported that sites with a history of more fires have fewer trees, higher densities of snags, and variable densities of shrubs. Bird species richness over two breeding seasons was markedly greater in the burned sites, and avian community structure varied systematically with the intensity of restoration. Canopy foliage gleaners such as the Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceus) and the Scarlet Tanager (Piranga olicavea) decreased with restoration, whereas omnivorous ground or shrub feeders and woodpeckers increased. Species favored by restoration and disturbance included the Baltimore Oriole (Icterus galbula), the Red-headed Woodpecker, and the Field Sparrow (Spizella pusilla). Many species such as the Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea), Field Sparrow, and American Goldfinch (Cardeulis tristis) breed regularly in oak savannas and nest or forage in shrubs (Sample & Mossman 1994 , Davis et al. 2000 and are also characteristic of edge habitats and successional habitats such as abandoned pastures. Frequent and pervasive burns will eliminate shrubs; therefore, the frequency of fire disturbance can significantly change the diversity of bird communities within restored oak savannas and woodlands."}, {"section_title": "Southeastern Pine Savannas", "text": "The upland landscapes of the southeastern United States were once dominated by open pine savannas with an herbaceous understory (Platt 1999) . These savannas covered an estimated 200 \u00d7 10 6 ha (Platt 1999) and were dominated by longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) (McPherson 1997) . At elevations below 75 m, these savannas were nearly continuous along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts from North Carolina to Texas.\nFrost (1998) estimated that lightning caused fires every 1-3 y over much of the region. The pine savannas of the southeastern United States, therefore, are one of the most pyrogenic vegetation types known. Not surprisingly, changing land use, fire suppression, commercial logging, and grazing have had immense impact on the vegetation of the region. By 1985, only 4% of the pre-European settlement savannas remained (Noss 1989 , Platt 1999 ) with only 3000 ha in old-growth form.\nThe avifauna of the region includes three species that are essentially endemic; the Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis), the Brown-headed Nuthatch (Sitta pusilla), and the Bachman's Sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis) (Jackson 1988) . The range and abundances of the Red-cockaded Woodpecker have decreased dramatically; this species is classified as federally endangered. The Bachman's Sparrow has also decreased significantly throughout much of its range, although it can use early successional pine fields (Dunning & Watts 1990) . Fire-disturbed habitat characterized by large, well-spaced pines and lack of midstory trees (especially encroaching hardwood species) is essential for the Red-cockaded Woodpecker (James et al. 1997 , Plentovich et al. 1998 . Habitat requirements for the Bachman's Sparrow can vary geographically, but this species was historically also dependent on fire (Dunning & Watts 1990 , Plentovich et al. 1998 .\nThe significant historical role of fire in molding the upland landscapes of the southeast, coupled with the endangered status of Red-cockaded Woodpeckers has generated considerable interest in the study of fire and avian biodiversity in the region (Wilson et al. 1995) . A 15-y study of fire suppression in a Florida pine woodland documented progressive changes in habitat structure and floristics as the herbaceous understory was lost and mesophytic hardwoods encroached (Engstrom et al. 1984) . Avian species composition changed concomitantly, with open-habitat species such as the Bachman's Sparrow and Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius ludovicianus) disappearing within 9 y as species characteristic of hardwood forest colonized the site.\nHabitat management for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers, such as short intervals between growing season fires and removal of midstory, has provided opportunities to assess how disturbance influences overall community structure. These studies provide evidence that management for an obligate disturbance species can have important collateral benefits for the regional avifauna. Burger et al. (1998) reported that intense management for woodpeckers promotes local increases in seven species that are declining regionally or nationally. These species occur regularly in early successional habitat or mature pine-grassland habitat with an herbaceous understory. Management units for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers in South Carolina also attracted over 30 scrub and successional species soon after burning and thinning of the canopy and midstory (Krementz & Christie 1999) ."}, {"section_title": "Grasslands", "text": "Before European settlement, about 162 \u00d7 10 6 ha of grasslands occurred in North America in three major ecoregions: tallgrass prairie, shortgrass prairie, and mixedgrass prairie (Samson & Knopf 1996 , Herkert & Knopf 1998 . Loss of native grassland habitat has been nearly complete in all regions (Samson & Knopf 1996) , resulting from conversion to cropland, planting of exotics, overgrazing, and encroachment by shrubs (Vickery et al. 1999) . The biogeographic history of North American grassland is complex, but these ecosystems undoubtedly developed with frequent fire from lightning strikes and fires set by Native Americans (see several chapters in Samson & Knopf 1996) . The frequency of fire and other disturbance agents such as grazing or mowing (a detrimental form of anthropogenic disturbance depending on when it occurs; see Bollinger et al. 1990 ) is a major determinant of the structure and plant species composition of most types of prairie. Vickery et al. (1999) identified 32 bird species that are obligate to temperate-zone grasslands in North America, and they listed an additional 52 species that regularly occur in grasslands or ecotonal grasslands such as savannas.\nManaging disturbance is the foundation of grassland restoration and conservation (Leopold 1949) . Surprisingly few studies have been designed to assess fire effects on grassland birds, but it is evident that the temporal and spatial scales of disturbance have important consequences for habitat suitability. A 23-y study by Johnson (1997) in mixed-grass prairie in North Dakota assessed the effects of a 3-5 y burn rotation on avian abundances. Burning initially rid sites of vegetation and created open ground or short herbaceous vegetation; succession then led to taller vegetation and encroachment of woody vegetation. Avian responses to fire disturbance and subsequent succession fall into three groups: 1. those species that immediately colonized such as the Killdeer (Charadrius vociferous), Marbled Godwit (Limosa fedoa), or Upland Sandpiper (Bartramia longicauda); 2. species that used sites about 2 y after burning, but before woody encroachment, such as the Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) and Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum); and 3. species that required woody vegetation and relatively long-term protection from disturbance such as Common Yellowthroats (Geothlypis trichas). Similar patterns of turnover were found by Madden et al. (1999) in mixed-grass prairies in North Dakota that burn frequently. Therefore, even within the constraints of what is a prairie or grassland, there is an important short-term successional cycle that is disturbance-dependent, with significant turnover in avian community structure. Fire is particularly important in mesic grasslands that are comparatively productive and where woody encroachment proceeds rapidly (Madden et al. 1999) .\nTime elapsed since fire disturbance also influences bird populations in tallgrass prairie. Local abundances of Henslow's Sparrows (Ammodramus henslowii), a species of conservation concern throughout much of its range (Peterjohn & Sauer 1999) , are highly sensitive to near-term fire history. In Illinois, newly burned sites are generally avoided and greatest abundances are attained on sites 2-4 y postburn (Herkert & Glass 1999) within a relatively specific range of vegetation heights and litter depths."}, {"section_title": "EFFECTS OF FLOODPLAIN DISTURBANCE", "text": "Floodplains are among the most disturbance-prone ecosystems. Although flood pulses tend to be predictably seasonal in most regions of the earth, the severity and timing of the flood pulse vary greatly (Malanson 1993 , Sparks 1995 . Floods create oxbow lakes and backwaters, and promote primary successional gradients as plant communities form on newly created soils inside meander loops (point bars) and on islands (Malanson 1993) . By depositing silt on the floodplain, floods enhance primary productivity . Severe floods can scour most or all vegetation from a floodplain; lack of severe flooding can allow woody encroachment on low-lying sections (Johnson 1994) . The \"flood pulse concept\" (Junk et al. 1989 ) recognizes the importance of seasonal floods in promoting high biodiversity and productivity in the lateral floodplain. The connection between rivers and their backwaters is crucial for wildlife, especially fishes (Sparks 1995) and waterfowl (Bellrose et al. 1983 ). The intermediate disturbance hypothesis (Connell 1978) has been implicitly recognized in studies of floodplain ecosystems (Conner & Day 1976) . Floodplain disturbances create an extraordinary diversity of habitats in river systems where floods are not constrained or altered and terrestrial bird communities of floodplains are some of the richest in the world (e.g., Terborgh et al. 1990 ). The river continuum concept (Vannote et al. 1980) relates the magnitude and predictability of seasonal flood pulses to the size of the river or stream with maximal diversity predicted in midsized rivers where levels of disturbance are intermediate.\nPerhaps because of their high productivity and rich soils, floodplain habitats are also among the most endangered ecosystems (Dynesius & Nilsson 1994) . Rivers have been dammed, channelized, straightjacketed by levees, subjected to increasing agricultural runoff, and lost to agriculture and plantation forestry (Hunt 1988 , Sparks 1995 . Floodplains have therefore lost much of their fish and wildlife as once-productive backwater swamps, marshes, and lakes have been isolated or subjected to excessive siltation when they do flood (Bellrose et al. 1983 , Hunt 1988 , Sparks 1995 . In North America, three of the four terrestrial bird species that became extinct since European settlement depended largely on floodplain forests, including the Ivory-billed Woodpecker (Campephilus principalis), Carolina Parakeet (Conuropsis carolinensis), and Bachman's Warbler (Vermivora bachmanii) (Askins 2000). Riparian forest loss in western North America is usually estimated at 95% or greater as a result of conversion to agriculture and alteration of hydrology (Knopf et al. 1988) .\nIn this section, we review the linkages between disturbances and floodplain bird communities in three regions in North America: desert rivers of the southwest United States, big rivers of the central United States, and forested rivers of the southeastern United States."}, {"section_title": "Riparian Forests of Southwestern North America", "text": "Western riparian forests provide important resources for birds (Grinnell & Miller 1944 , Rice et al. 1984 , Rosenberg et al. 1991 . A typical southwestern riparian successional gradient consists of sandbars in the frequently flooded river channel, willows (Salix spp.) along the edge of the channel and on islands, cottonwoods (Populus spp.) farther back from the river channel, and, in areas less frequently flooded, more diverse hardwoods. Each plant community occurs in a well-defined, often narrow, zone with abrupt borders reflecting the frequency of disturbance (Rosenberg et al. 1991) . These zones contain rich breeding bird communities that may be associated with particular plant species for nesting and feeding. Disturbance-dependent willows, for example, are strongly preferred by several species and subspecies that are currently rare and endangered. Examples are Southwestern Willow Flycatchers (Empidonax traillii extimus), Arizona Bell's Vireos (Vireo bellii arizonae), and Least Bell's Vireos (V.b. pusillus) (Askins 2000) .\nAlteration of the disturbance regimes in western riparian forests has threatened this entire system (Carothers & Johnson 1975 , Szaro & DeBano 1985 , Knopf et al. 1988 , Ohmart 1994 . Damming of rivers has reduced the extent of the willowcottonwood plant communities by reducing the severity and frequency of flood disturbance (Rice et al. 1983 , Anderson et al. 1983 , with the resulting decline of the many bird species that depend upon these communities (Strong & Bock 1990 ). Dams reduce seasonal flooding in undammed portions of the river, which dries out backwaters and oxbows. Willows and cottonwoods do not grow along newly created reservoirs because water levels fluctuate too greatly to allow seed germination (Hunter et al. 1987) . Invasive introduced salt cedars (Tamarix chinensis) have taken over extensive areas of the floodplain in Arizona because damming and irrigation projects have made the soil more salty and hence more favorable to this species (Rosenberg et al. 1991) . These dense homogeneous stands of salt cedar have far fewer birds than do native woodlands (Anderson et al. 1977) . After much trial and error, some of these riparian zones have been restored successfully (reviewed in Askins 2000), and flood pulses are being reintroduced to the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon."}, {"section_title": "Large Rivers of Central North America", "text": "Large floodplain systems such as those found in the Midwestern United States were historically among the Earth's most productive ecosystems (Bellrose et al. 1983, Sparks 1995), largely as a result of seasonal flood pulses that enriched soils and created diverse landforms and plant communities including backwaters, oxbow lakes, willow/cottonwood forests, mixed hardwood forests on natural levees, and more open sandbar habitats. In the Midwest, these floodplains supported huge populations of migratory waterfowl (Bellrose et al. 1983 ) and diverse communities of terrestrial birds (Zimmerman & Tatschl 1975 , Knutson et al. 1996 .\nDisturbance regimes within these systems have been altered by navigation dams, levees, and agriculture (Bellrose et al. 1983 , Dynesius & Nilsson 1994 . Most backwaters are isolated hydrologically or they rapidly fill with silt (Bellrose et al. 1983 , Sparks 1995 during the summer. Levees increase the severity of floods in the river channel , and flood-intolerant trees are lost in the remaining floodplain (Hosner 1958 , Hunt 1988 , Knutson & Klaas 1998 . As a result, remaining mixed floodplain forests are being replaced by skeletal forests of dead trees and willow thickets (Yin & Nelson 1995 , Knutson & Klaas 1997 . Before they fall, dead trees temporarily provide habitats for cavity-nesting birds such as Red-headed Woodpeckers and Prothonotary Warblers (Protonotaria citrea) (Knutson & Klaas 1997) .\nWith reduced flood severity, many rivers in the Great Plains that formerly lacked woody cover are lined with mixed hardwoods more characteristic of floodplains east of the Mississippi (Knopf & Scott 1990 , Johnson 1994 . Eastern forest birds use these new wooded corridors to invade western forests, activity that threatens the natural integrity of regional bird communities (Knopf et al. 1988 ). The loss of sandbar habitat resulting from altered disturbance regimes has been implicated in the declines of the endangered Interior Least Tern (Sterna antillarum) and Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus) (Schwalbach et al. 1993) , which nest most successfully on island sandbars to which predators have little access (Kirsch 1996) ."}, {"section_title": "Southeastern North American Floodplain Forests", "text": "Southeastern floodplain forests have rich bird communities (Fredrickson 1980 , Knutson et al. 1996 , Sallabanks et al. 2000 ) that appear to depend in part on varying levels of disturbance. Carolina Parakeets and Ivory-billed Woodpeckers may have depended upon mature floodplain forest, a habitat that has been almost completely logged and converted to rowcrops (Askins 2000) . At least two species, the extinct Bachman's Warbler and the rare Swainson's Warblers (Limnothlypis swainsonii) historically inhabited dense stands of cane (Arundinaria gigantea) (Meanley 1966 , Eddleman et al. 1980 , Hamel 1986 , Remsen 1986 ), a plant that thrives at an intermediate level of floodplain disturbance and occasional fire. Human activities have altered disturbance regimes to the extent that cane stands are now rare (Askins 2000) . Several bird species depend largely upon tree species associated with varying levels of disturbance (Gabbe et al. 2001) . Yellow-throated Warblers (Dendroica dominica), for example, depend upon bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) growing in backwaters (Gabbe et al. 2001) . There is little evidence, however, that bird communities in this region change dramatically along successional gradients as has been documented in rivers with unaltered floodplain dynamics in, for example, Amazonia (Dyrcz 1990 , Terborgh et al. 1990 , Robinson 1997 , Robinson & Terborgh 1997 .\nRiparian disturbances in southeastern floodplains create natural edges such as the borders of oxbow lakes, natural levees, and the rivers themselves (Hupp & Osterkamp 1985) . The natural edges may enhance both bird community diversity and nesting success (Sallabanks et al. 2000 , Knutson et al. 2000 . The complex vegetation structure along natural disturbances may provide dense cover in which nests may be concealed (Knutson et al. 2000) ."}, {"section_title": "EFFECTS OF SILVICULTURAL DISTURBANCE", "text": "Nearly one half (1563 million ha) of the area of natural forests worldwide is considered available for timber harvest given current legal and economic restrictions (FAO 1999) . In 1991, total world wood production was 4410 million m 3 , 37% of which was in the tropics and the balance mostly in northern temperate and boreal conifer forests (Whitmore 1998 ). Timber harvest is likely a more extensive disturbance agent in developed countries than all forms of natural disturbance. From the early 1980s to the early 1990s, for example, approximately 24% of the timberland in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota was disturbed by forest management (timber stand improvement, harvesting, planting, etc.) and 13% by natural processes (fire, windthrow, flooding, and pests) (Schmidt et al. 1999) .\nSilvicultural treatments are typically applied to stands or patches with similar tree composition and structure, often on a definable ecological land type. Regeneration treatments remove existing trees and establish tree reproduction. The clear-cut, shelterwood, and seed-tree methods regenerate even-aged stands and selection methods regenerate uneven-aged stands (Nyland 1996) . Intermediate treatments modify existing forest stands (stand improvement) or control its growth and provide early financial returns (thinnings) (Nyland 1996) .\nUneven-aged and even-aged methods differ in the scale and intensity of disturbance. Uneven-aged methods maintain a mix of tree sizes or ages within a habitat patch by periodically harvesting individual or small groups of trees. Even-aged methods harvest most or all of the overstory and create a fairly uniform habitat patch dominated by trees of the same age (Nyland 1996) . At a landscape level, however, both methods can remove a similar volume of trees and regenerate similar areas of forest but the size and distribution of disturbance patches varies (Shifley et al. 2000) . Bird communities differ in their response to regeneration methods as a result of these differences in scale and intensity of disturbance.\nFor brevity, we review mainly the effects of regeneration practices in natural or semi-natural North American forests where conservation is at least a secondary goal, and do not consider intermediate treatments, intensive culture, or agroforestry."}, {"section_title": "North American Forests, Within Patch Effects", "text": "EVEN-AGED METHODS Even-age regeneration usually leads to near complete turnover in the breeding bird community (Webb et al. 1977 , Conner et al. 1979 , Franzreb & Ohmart 1978 . About 50% of neotropical migratory birds in central US hardwood forests prefer disturbance-mediated early successional stands created by harvest and 10-20% prefer these habitats in southern pine forests (Dickson et al. 1995) .\nIn central and northern hardwood forests in the United States, nearly all (n > 50) species that previously bred in the mature forest abandon regeneration cuts (Annand & Thompson 1997) . Bird communities respond significantly to the disturbance and ensuing successional changes. If residual live and dead trees are left in cut-over stands, some species such as Scarlet and Summer Tanager (Piranga rubra), Great Crested Flycatcher (Myiarchus crinitus), and Red-bellied Woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus) that use the canopy or tree boles may continue to use the stand. Species that soon colonize and use residual snags, trees, slashpiles, or a rapidly developing herbaceous layer include Eastern Bluebirds (Sialia sialis), Northern Flicker (Colaptes auratus), Winter Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes), Carolina Wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus), Field Sparrow, and American Goldfinch. By the second growing season, developing ground vegetation, low shrubs, and young trees attract numerous species, including Common Yellowthroat, Chestnut-sided Warbler (Dendroica pensylvanica), Mourning Warbler (Oporornis philadelphia), Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus), Yellow-breasted Chat (Icteria virens), Prairie Warbler (Dendroica discolor), and Blue-winged Warbler (Vermivora pinus). By 10 y after timber harvest, tree reproduction forms a closed canopy, most early successional species abandon the site, and mature forest species begin to colonize (DeGraaf & Chadwick 1987 . Overall, densities of birds in young regenerating forests often are similar to or much greater than those in mature or midsuccessional pole-sized forests (Conner et al. 1979 , Yahner 1986 , Probst et al. 1992 , Hagan et al. 1997 , Hobson & Schieck 1999 . Moreover, species richness may be greater in regenerating stands in the eastern United States (Conner et al. 1979 , Yahner 1986 , King et al. 2001 .\nRegeneration methods influence the future vegetation composition of a stand. For example, use of shelterwood or selection methods as opposed to clear-cutting will favor more shade-tolerant species over intolerant species, such as western hemlock over Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) in western conifer forests, or sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and American beech (Fagus grandifolia) over oaks in eastern deciduous forests. The use of the seed tree method can directly control the seed source for regeneration and is often used in southern pine forests. Species composition is sometimes directly manipulated by the planting of improved tree stock and often occurs with Douglas fir in western forests and loblolly (Pinus taeda) and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) in southern forests. These shifts in floristic composition can alter an avian community because many bird species have demonstrated preferences for various tree species as foraging substrates (Franzreb & Ohmart 1978 , Holmes & Robinson 1981 .\nA few studies have reported reproductive rates for songbirds in forest patches managed by even-aged management. In extensively forested northern New England, predation rates on artificial ground and shrub nests were not different among successional stages (DeGraaf & Angelstam 1993) . Elsewhere, Morse & Robinson (1999) observed lesser nest predation of Kentucky Warblers in mature forest than in recent clear-cuts. Annand & Thompson (1997) reported comparatively high nest success and low parasitism rates for several shrub nesting birds in stands regenerated by the clear-cut or shelterwood methods in Midwestern US hardwood forests.\nEven-aged management regenerates an entire stand, so stand size determines the size of the new habitat patch. Krementz & Christie (1999) found no evidence, however, that species richness or reproductive success varied among stands growing after clear-cuts ranging from 2.8 to 56.7 ha in southeastern longleaf pine forests."}, {"section_title": "UNEVEN-AGED METHODS", "text": "Single-tree and group-selection regeneration methods remove only a portion of the trees in a habitat patch and attempt to maintain a constant tree size/class structure over time. As a result, the turnover in bird species following a regeneration harvest, and during succession between harvests, is less significant than that following even-aged regeneration harvests .\nIn eastern deciduous forests, most mature forest species occur in similar or slightly lower numbers in forests managed by the selection method than in untreated mature forest (Annand & Thompson 1997 . Gap-dependent species such as Hooded Warblers (Wilsonia citrina), Indigo Bunting, White-eyed Vireo (Vireo griseus), and Carolina Wren, or species dependent on understory density such as the Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorus), are more abundant in forests managed by the selection method than in mature even-aged forests. In New England's northern hardwood forests, bird communities in uneven-aged forest managed by selection method are also similar to those in mature forests (DeGraaf & Chadwick 1987) . Notwithstanding, there is some evidence that uneven-aged management may selectively favor red maple (Acer rubrum), a change that could result in less oak and beech mast for birds and other wildlife (R. A. Askins, personal communication). Selection cutting also appears to have minimal impact on the composition and abundance of bird communities in western conifer forest. Similarly, in mixedconifer forest in the western Sierra Nevada, there were few consistent differences in bird communities between uneven-aged and mature even-aged forests (Morrison 1992) .\nAgain, there is limited knowledge of reproductive success in forest patches managed by uneven-aged methods. In forests managed by the selection method in southern Illinois, reproductive success of four songbird species was not, on average, greater in logged or nonlogged forest, and cowbird parasitism was only greater for two species in recent cuts . Nest success of early succession birds does not appear to differ between group selection cuts and clear-cuts in eastern deciduous forests (King et al. 2001 ."}, {"section_title": "North American Forests, Landscape Level Effects", "text": "Landscapes managed by even-aged methods are often a mosaic of different-aged stands, whereas those managed by uneven-aged methods are often less heterogeneous and composed of a range of tree sizes. used a simple model to demonstrate how these patterns in composition might affect \u03b2 diversity in central hardwood forests. The biggest differences among landscapes managed by these silvicultural methods was not in the abundance of species that nest in mature forest, but in early succession species that favored either small gaps (created by selection cutting) or large patches (created by clear-cutting). Thompson et al. (1992) compared the abundance species in landscapes with and without even-aged management (clear-cutting). In general, the abundance of only a few species nesting in mid-or late-successional forest differed significantly between landscapes, and \u03b2 diversity and abundance of early successional species was greater in managed landscapes. These patterns of diversity vary with rotation time between harvests, but silvicultural disturbance clearly has a potentially beneficial effect on avian diversity.\nNonetheless, timber harvest decreases the continuity of mature or old forest in the landscape and is a source of habitat fragmentation. Forest fragmentation by human dominated land-uses, such as agriculture or urban and suburban development, is hypothesized to reduce reproductive success of forest songbirds by elevating numbers of generalist predators and nest predation in the landscape or by increasing the amount of edge and edge-related nest predation . In one of the few controlled landscape-scale studies of the effects of regeneration practices, Clawson et al. (2001) estimated differences in abundance and reproductive success of common forest birds in Midwestern oak forests before and after logging. Densities of some forest species decreased while others increased following logging; however, neither nest predation or cowbird brood parasitism increased following logging.\nSyntheses are hampered by differences in methods (especially artificial vs. real nests), the potential effects of other uncontrolled local factors, or effects of landscape context (i.e., Donovan et al. 1997) . Manolois (2001) reviewed evidence for edge effects resulting from timber harvest and concluded that many of the studies that reported no edge effects did not have adequate statistical design or power to detect effects if they were present, and 9 of 13 studies with adequate power detected edge effects. General pooling of species may be misleading since lower nesting success near edges may be specific to certain groups such as ground nesters (Flaspohler et al. 2001) . Overall, evidence is conflicting for the nature of edge effects between mature forest and recently harvested stands (Yahner & Scott 1988 , Morse & Robinson 1999 , Manolis et al. 2001 ."}, {"section_title": "Conservation Implications and Research Needs", "text": "This paper and other analyses (e.g., Alverson et al. 1994 , Askins 2000 summarize evidence that ecological disturbance is fundamental to the conservation of birds. Whereas outright habitat loss is the most direct threat to avian biodiversity worldwide, it is clear that significant numbers of bird species are associated with habitats and ecosystems created by diverse forms of disturbance. We do not minimize the conservation significance of species associated with habitats that are rarely subjected to large-scale disturbance (e.g., primary or old growth forests), and we are encouraged that forest birds have benefited by afforestation in the eastern United States (Askins 2000). Rather, we believe that understanding and applying ecological disturbance offers opportunities to conserve large and diverse group species-many of which are declining as a result of habitat loss and successional changes in habitat structure.\nThe frequency and intensity of ecological disturbance is a determinant of the presence of many terrestrial habitat types (or ecosystems) in North America that support significant components of avian biodiversity (Figure 2) . We believe this offers significant management and research opportunities; if conservation strategies for birds are to be effective, some combination of these habitats (along with tracts of mature forest) should be maintained within or across landscapes. Protected habitat should not be protected from processes that maintain or conserve significant elements of biodiversity.\nAs shown here, the bulk of information about disturbance and birds is on variation in populations and communities resulting from the initial effects of disturbance Figure 2 Selected terrestrial habitats used by birds in North America qualitatively ordinated according to frequency and intensity of disturbance. Even-aged forest can result from fire, wind throw, floods, or even-aged silviculture. Uneven-aged forest results from small-scale wind throw or uneven-aged silviculture. Woodlands and savanna result from moderate to light intensity frequent fires. Grasslands generally result from frequent and intense fire, grazing, or both. or ensuing succession. These studies are highly informative to land managers, but the need for comprehensive understanding of disturbance and birds motivates a complex research agenda. A prevailing need is to design and implement long-term and large-scale studies that monitor the effects of disturbance. Studies to date have generally been short-term, without controls, unreplicated, and unplanned (Finch et al. 1997) . Outlined below are the issues and questions that we believe are the most pressing."}, {"section_title": "Associations Between Habitat Disturbance and Population Viability", "text": "Studies of forest birds, habitat fragmentation, and edge effects clearly identify the usefulness of information on annual reproductive success and other demographic traits that affect population viability (Heske et al. 2001) . Data on local abundances are crucial but incomplete in the context of estimating viability and assessing land-management options . With few exceptions (e.g., Johnson & Temple 1990 , Krementz & Christie 1999 , little is known about the demography of birds in disturbance-mediated or successional habitats. Our expectation is that fecundity will change with successional changes in habitat, especially in grasslands and early successional forests, but details on the time-frame of this dynamic will be highly informative to managers in determining desirable intervals between prescribed fire, silvicultural treatments, or other modes of disturbance. Comparative studies from various geographic locations will be highly informative. In the Midwest, for example, prescribed fire and restoration maintain oak savannas in a specific disturbance-mediated state, but long-term successional changes are common following the less frequent stand-replacing fires in coniferous forests.\nThe effects of patch size on disturbance-dependent birds also requires close study. Numerous studies confirm that avian diversity and reproductive success is, on average, greater in larger than smaller patches of forest and grasslands , Heske et al. 2001 . The effects of patch size on birds in more transitional, disturbance-mediated habitats such as early successional forests and oak savannas are less clear. Early results from a study comparing nesting success of forest birds in managed forests found little or no difference in nesting success of disturbance-dependent birds in small selection openings vs. larger clear-cuts ; see also King et al. 2001 )."}, {"section_title": "Disturbance and Landscape Context", "text": "Questions about the scale and landscape context of disturbance will be different depending on the mode of disturbance and the ecoregion involved. In the extensive coniferous forests of the western United States and southern Canada, a primary question is how to apply or allow disturbance so that a natural or natural-like mosaic pattern of cover types is maintained (Hunter 1993 , Landres et al. 1999 . In isolated oak savanna restorations, the question is the effect of surrounding habitat; that is, what are the effects (if any) of nearby grassland, forest, or urban areas on the structure of savanna bird communities (Temple 1998) ? Specific issues include the dispersion and arrangement of disturbance patches. Such studies will also serve to address questions from theory on ecological neighborhoods and the scale of ecological patterns or processes (Addicott et al. 1987 , Engstrom & Mikushinski 1998 . The frequency and extent of natal and breeding dispersal are key to determining the scale at which birds respond demographically to landscape features (Dunning et al. 1992 , Vos et al. 2001 and are a persistent uncertainty for most species. Notable exceptions are the model studies on the Bachman's Sparrow and the Red-cockaded Woodpecker that relate ecological disturbance, landscape features, and the spatial structure of their populations (Dunning et al. 1992 , Engstrom & Mikusinski 1998 , James et al. 1997 . Ideally, local conservation decisions regarding ecological disturbance should be made within a multi-scale framework that acknowledges landscape and regional goals based on historical heterogeneity in ecological landtypes (Thompson & DeGraaf 2001) ."}, {"section_title": "Effects of Natural vs. Anthropogenic Disturbance", "text": "Future land management planning will have to consider a range of approaches to balance economic needs and conservation objectives. Understanding how these different approaches affect the size and viability of birds associated with disturbance is essential. For example, a stand-replacing fire and a clear-cut both remove trees but the long-term implications for avian conservation are likely to be different (Hobson & Schieck 1999 , Imbeau et al. 1999 . One approach to the conservation of disturbance-dependent birds is to restore natural disturbance regimes, but this is realistic only on large expanses such as those in the western United States. Elsewhere, disturbance-dependent birds are likely to depend on human activities that stem from direct management or commercial activities. Ways to optimize these activities for conservation, renewable resources, and agriculture requires immediate study. In forests with commercial value, for example, the range of options includes (from most to least intensive): short rotation intensive culture, plantation forestry, commercial forestry in natural stands, multiple-use or ecosystem management, and wilderness management through natural disturbance. Another issue is the integrity of floodplain bird communities that depend upon restoration of flood-pulse disturbances (Galat et al. 1998 ); at present, there is disagreement over whether the flood pulse should be mimicked through moist soil management (Galat et al. 1998) or promoted by directly allowing the river to flow into sections of the floodplain during flood pulses.\nFinally, we believe that the social implications of ecological disturbance require exploration. Episodes of opposition to prescribed fire and silviculture, for example, strongly identify the need to educate the public on the positive role that natural and anthropogenic disturbance can play in the conservation of avian biodiversity (Marynowski & Jacobson 1999) ."}]
