[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Alterations in parietal and temporal white matter microstructure derived from diffusion tensor imaging occur in preclinical and clinical Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid beta (A\u03b2) deposition and such white matter alterations are two pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. However, the relationship between these pathologies is not yet understood, partly since conventional diffusion MRI methods cannot distinguish between cellular and extracellular processes. Thus, we studied A\u03b2-associated longitudinal diffusion MRI changes in A\u03b2-positive (N = 21) and A\u03b2-negative (N = 51) cognitively normal elderly obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset using linear mixed models. A\u03b2-positivity was based on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative amyloid-PET recommendations using a standardized uptake value ratio cut-off of 1.11. We used free-water imaging to distinguish cellular and extracellular changes. We found that A\u03b2-positive subjects had increased baseline right uncinate fasciculus free-water fraction (FW), associated with worse baseline Alzheimer's disease assessment scale scores. Furthermore, A\u03b2-positive subjects showed faster decrease in fractional anisotropy (FW-corrected) in the right uncinate fasciculus and faster age-dependent right inferior longitudinal fasciculus FW increases over time. Right inferior longitudinal fasciculus FW increases were associated with greater memory decline. Importantly, these results remained significant after controlling for gray and white matter volume and hippocampal volume. This is the first study to illustrate the influence of A\u03b2 burden on early longitudinal (in addition to baseline) white matter changes in cognitively normal elderly individuals at-risk of Alzheimer's disease, thus underscoring the importance of longitudinal studies in assessing microstructural alterations in individuals at risk of Alzheimer's disease prior to symptoms onset.\nAlzheimer's disease, amyloid beta, at-risk cognitively normal elderly, diffusion tensor imaging, free-water correction, longitudinal study"}, {"section_title": "", "text": ". Recent models hypothesize that A\u03b2 deposition is closely followed in time by white matter microstructural abnormalities in the at-risk cognitively normal elderly stage (Jack Jr. et al., 2013; Sachdev, Zhuang, Braidy, & Wen, 2013) . Supporting this hypothesis are diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) studies in the asymptomatic elderly and mild cognitive impairment, finding microstructural alterations in parietal and temporal white matter fibers, including the uncinate fasciculus and parahippocampal cingulum (Englund, Brun, & Alling, 1988; Remy, Vayssiere, Saint-Aubert, Barbeau, & Pariente, 2015; Rieckmann et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2012) . However, evidence has not been conclusive with some illustrating reduced fractional anisotropy or white matter integrity in the fornix and corpus callosum associated with A\u03b2 burden (Chao et al., 2013; Gold et al., 2014; Melah et al., 2016) while others report higher fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity in the hippocampal cingulum, corpus callosum, and superior longitudinal fasciculus in cognitively normal older individuals Molinuevo et al., 2014; Racine et al., 2014) . Longitudinal assessments, ideally sampling individuals at the same stage and subtype of AD, are thus needed to elucidate such complex associations between A\u03b2 burden and white matter microstructure in the asymptomatic preclinical phase of AD.\nSuch high variability of DTI findings in the clinically normal elderly could also be attributed to the lack of specificity of DTI measures to various biological pathologies, such as axonal degeneration, demyelination, extracellular volume changes (Assaf & Pasternak, 2008) , agingrelated brain atrophy (Ge et al., 2002) , and inflammation possibly related with A\u03b2 deposition (Perez-Nievas et al., 2013) . Recently, the free-water (FW) imaging method has been developed to eliminate partial volume with freely diffusing extracellular water molecules in diffusionweighted MRI (Pasternak, Sochen, Gur, Intrator, & Assaf, 2009; Pasternak, Westin, Dahlben, Bouix, & Kubicki, 2015) . The method allows separately identifying extracellular changes affecting the FW measure, from cellular changes influencing the FW-corrected fractional anisotropy measure (FAt). Accordingly FW changes can be sensitive to extracellular processes including atrophy, neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier permeability modulation (Ji et al., 2017; Pasternak et al., 2012; PerezNievas et al., 2013) , while FAt changes are more sensitive to alterations in white matter microstructural organization (Lyall et al., 2017; Montal et al., 2017; Pasternak et al., 2012 Pasternak et al., , 2015 .\nAlthough cognitively normal elderly individuals exhibiting AD pathologies have been an important population for disease intervention and understanding (Palmqvist et al., 2017; Rieckmann et al., 2016) , a few research gaps remain to be addressed. Little is known about the A\u03b2 burden influence on the temporal progression of white matter measures in the asymptomatic preclinical phases of AD (Maier-Hein et al., 2015; Rieckmann et al., 2016; Sachdev et al., 2013) . Moreover, while we and others have indicated associations between white matter microstructure and cognition in the cognitively normal elderly (Hong et al., 2015; Lovden et al., 2014; Vernooij et al., 2009) , it is unclear if these correlations are driven by at-risk asymptomatic elderly individuals. Understanding whether aging modulates the interaction between A\u03b2 burden and white matter measures is another important un-answered gap toward better understanding of AD progression.\nTo fill these gaps, the present study aimed to compare longitudinal white matter measures in asymptomatic elderly, with and without A\u03b2 burden, from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database. We used linear mixed modeling to assess the influence of A\u03b2 burden on FW-corrected white matter microstructure and FW. We hypothesize that participants with significant A\u03b2 burden (A\u03b2-positive) would show increased FW and reduced FAt in parietal and temporal fibers compared with those without significant A\u03b2 burden (A\u03b2-negative) at baseline and/or over time. We also sought to test whether these white matter abnormalities related to cognitive decline at baseline and over time in at-risk cognitively normal elderly individuals.

Eighty-four cognitively normal older adults were first identified based on the inclusion, exclusion, and diagnostic criteria in the ADNI2 procedures manual (Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, 2008) . Following quality control, out of these 84 participants, 72 (43 Females; mean age = 73.72 years, SD = 5.65 years at baseline, Table 1 ) cognitively normal participants were included in our study. Based on the ADNI criteria, cognitively normal individuals were required to be free of subjective memory concerns, have a score within the normal range on the WMS Logical Memory II (\u22659 for 16 years of education and above), have a mini-mental state examination score between 24 and 30, and a clinical dementia rating of 0. Individual participants were chosen if they underwent at least two time points of both neuroimaging and neuropsychological assessments, which included: mini-mental state examination, clinical dementia rating, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS), and composite measures for executive function and memory. They were also required to have a mini-mental state examination score of 26 or greater at every time point and maintained a stable diagnosis over at least two consecutive time points. It should be noted that out of all the cognitively normal elderly participants in our study, only five participants progressed to the mild cognitive impairment stage at follow-up time points. Two of these subjects were A\u03b2 -positive at baseline while three were A\u03b2 -negative. Importantly data at the time point of conversion and time points following conversion was not included in our study and analyses.

For each participant's T1 images, automated segmentation and cortical parcellation was carried out using the FreeSurfer \"recon-all\" processing stream (Desikan et al., 2006; Fischl et al., 2002; , which included motion correction, removal of nonbrain tissue, automated Talairach transformation, intensity correction, volumetric segmentation, and cortical surface reconstruction and parcellation. The FreeSurfer gray matter volume estimations were done in two different ways: (a) using FreeSurfer default automated settings and (b) using manually edited brain and white matter masks. These crosssectionally processed images were subsequently run through the longitudinal stream in FreeSurfer. In this step, an unbiased within-participant template volume was created for each participant, and processing of all time points was then carried out using common information from this template, thus increasing sensitivity and robustness of the longitudinal analysis (Reuter, Schmansky, Rosas, & Fischl, 2012) . Hippocampal, gray matter volume and white matter volume were extracted for each participant at each time point using the Freesurfer recon-all segmentation step.\nFor DTI image analyses, TRActs Constrained by UnderLying Anatomy (TRACULA), part of FreeSurfer version 5.3, was used to preprocess the DTI data (including eddy-current compensation, motion correction, registration, white matter mask creation, and tensor fitting) and reconstruct 18 major white matter tracts of interest (Yendiki et al., 2011) . These 18 fibers comprise a representative labeling of all important established white matter pathways in the brain as recognized in previous literature. This is a novel algorithm for automated global probabilistic tractography that estimates the posterior probability of each pathway given the diffusion-weighted data. The posterior probability is decomposed into a data likelihood term, which uses the \"ball-and-stick\" model of diffusion (Behrens, Berg, Jbabdi, Rushworth, & Woolrich, 2007) , and a pathway prior term, which incorporates prior anatomical knowledge on the pathways from a set of training participants. The segmentation labels required by TRACULA were obtained by processing the T1-weighted images of the study participants as described above. The longitudinal version of TRACULA was used for our study, which computes the joint posterior probability of each pathway given the diffusion MRI data and anatomical segmentations of multiple time points at once. This has been shown to reduce noise, avoid bias toward any specific time point, ensure spatial correspondence between time points and improve both test-retest reliability and sensitivity to longitudinal white matter changes, when compared to reconstructing the pathways at each time point independently (Storsve, Fjell, Yendiki, & Walhovd, 2016; Yendiki, Reuter, Wilkens, Rosas, & Fischl, 2016) .

Specifically, the predicted values of each dependent variable (e.g., FW) at each time i and for each participant j was first computed using Equation (1) (excluding r ij ). For each participant separately, the predicted values were then regressed on time to obtain the participantspecific slopes (e.g., if the participant had four time points, the regression was done on four predicted FW values).

In this regard, it is also important to reiterate that there were no widespread A\u03b2-related effects on whole-brain white matter measures. Instead, early focal effects of A\u03b2 burden on white matter microstructure decline were observed in our study population of at-risk cognitively normal elderly individuals. Specifically, our investigation found differential changes, especially in the RUNC that can be interpreted as occurring either due to cellular or extracellular changes.\nWhile the RUNC showed A\u03b2-associated higher baseline FW, the RILF showed age and A\u03b2-associated longitudinal FW increases. There are many potential causes for extracellular changes, however the main FIGURE 5 Baseline Alzheimer's disease assessment scale score is associated with baseline right uncinate fasciculus free water. With increase in baseline ADAS score there was an increase in RUNC FW at baseline. Abbreviations: RUNC, right uncinate fasciculus; FW, free water; ADAS, Alzheimer's disease assessment scale causes comprise cellular density reduction, atrophy, and neuroinflammation ). An inflammatory response could be supported by increased cytokine levels, microglial activation and upregulation of inflammatory pathways in AD (Akiyama et al., 2000; Morales, Guzman-Martinez, Cerda-Troncoso, Farias, & Maccioni, 2014) .\nIndeed, A\u03b2 presence in the brain is thought to activate the inflammatory cascade, which may lead to greater extracellular water and associated water compartment changes (Guo, Yu, Grass, de Beer, & Kindy, 2002; Perez-Nievas et al., 2013) . We covary gray and white matter volume in order to control for low cell density or low dendritic volume, which may also explain FW changes . Our findings remained significant after controlling for these variables.\nWe also found A\u03b2-related longitudinal RUNC FAt reduction. Specifically, regarding this finding's effect size, we observed a significantly greater reduction of 0.05 in FAt value (i.e., 12.5% change) over the 4-year follow-up period in A\u03b2 +ve individuals when compared to A\u03b2 \u2212ve individuals. Since FAt changes originate from tissue itself, it may be better associated with axonal and myelin sheath degeneration . Indeed, reduced A\u03b2 clearance and its influence on blood brain barrier permeability is thought to impact white matter microstructure in prodromal AD, especially in temporal regions such as the hippocampus and parietal areas vulnerable to early A\u03b2 deposition and structural damage (Buckner et al., 2009; Cho et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2012; Iadecola, 2015; Montagne et al., 2015) . Cumulatively, such processes may lead to altered homeostasis, inflammation and eventually synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits, reflecting a possible mechanism underlying the deleterious influence of high A\u03b2 burden (Iadecola, 2015) . Our findings are also congruent with previous studies illustrating distinct A\u03b2-related blood brain barrier and white matter damage at baseline and over time in preclinical and prodromal phases of AD (Iadecola, 2015; Montagne et al., 2015; Rieckmann et al., 2016) . These findings further underscore the importance of the FW-correction method in differentiating tissue-associated from neuroinflammation-associated changes to enable a more precise interpretation of white matter alterations and their trajectory over time (Lyall et al., 2017; Pasternak et al., 2015) .\n4.2 | White matter fibers implicated in Alzheimer's disease show early signs of impairment in the at-risk cognitively normal elderly\nOur results highlighted the A\u03b2-associated effect on white matter microstructure in RUNC and RILF fibers, known to play important roles in AD development. The UNC links anterior temporal and parahippocampal regions with the medial orbitofrontal cortex, while the ILF links the temporal to the occipital lobe (Remy et al., 2015; Voineskos et al., 2012) . Notably, the ILF anteriorly joins the UNC and is considered an indirect pathway that relays information between occipital and orbitofrontal regions (Ashtari, 2012) . Associations between UNC and ILF disruptions and cognitive dysfunction in both memory and nonmemory domains have also been observed, reflecting the important role played by these fibers in early disease stages (Kantarci et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2011; Metzler-Baddeley, Hunt, et al., 2012; Voineskos et al., 2012) . Indeed, our findings of larger longitudinal A\u03b2-related effects in temporal RUNC and RILF in the cognitively normal elderly suggest that temporal areas appear to be affected early in A\u03b2 +ve participants. Default mode network regions including the temporal lobe are considered primary sites for early A\u03b2 deposition which might contribute to A\u03b2-related changes in FW and FAt in white matter fibers traversing these regions (Buckner et al., 2009; Palmqvist et al., 2017) . Moreover, recent findings posit a two-phase phenomenon for diffusivity changes in the asymptomatic preclinical AD stage.\nSimilar to the longitudinal RILF FW trajectory illustrated in A\u03b2 +ve subjects in our study, this biphasic model highlights initial FW decreases, followed by FW increases over time (Montal et al., 2017) , which might be atrophy-related. Importantly, evidence indicates that A\u03b2 deposition could influence such a trajectory (Racine et al., 2014) . Increases in A\u03b2 may initially reduce interstitial extraneuronal spaces (lower FW). However, at later stages A\u03b2 deposition likely influences degeneration and atrophy as illustrated by our FAt reductions over time in A\u03b2-positive subjects, which then in turn increase extracellular spaces (higher FW; Pasternak et al., 2012) . Thus, such a separation between tissue-related and extracellular water related changes can help better to understand the relationship between how changes in various DTI metrics relate to specific protein aggregation related neuropathological changes at various stages along the disease spectrum.\nWe also observed an A\u03b2-associated longitudinal decline in right hippocampal gray matter volume only, which could partly influence A\u03b2-related alterations in temporal RUNC and RILF as revealed in our spatial analysis. Moreover, UNC and ILF damage could be related to anterior medial temporal lobe gray matter atrophy and could begin in the earliest stages of disease (Damoiseaux et al., 2009; Villain et al., 2010) . Indeed, A\u03b2-associated hippocampal gray matter volume reduction is thought to be a causal event in white matter FA reduction in the UNC (Jack Jr. et al., 2014; Sachdev et al., 2013) . Thus, a possible temporal sequence of biomarker trajectory in the asymptomatic elderly at-risk of AD could involve early A\u03b2 deposition which then drives early microstructural changes in the UNC and other related fibers like the ILF, closely followed by gray matter atrophy and subsequent cognitive decline as disease sets in (Hong et al., 2015; Sachdev et al., 2013) .\nNevertheless, importantly, following hippocampal volume correction at each time point, A\u03b2-associated effects on both FW and FAt remained significant. Thus, other factors such as neuroinflammation, in addition to gray matter atrophy, may play a role in microstructural alterations (Salat et al., 2010) . While hippocampal atrophy is a hallmark of AD, it is unlikely to be holistically representative of A\u03b2-associated effects. On the other hand, white matter abnormalities, while subtle, are perhaps more informative since they are observed in addition to and disparate from hippocampal atrophy (Hong et al., 2015) .\nAlthough cognitive performance declined with increase in baseline age (but not over time), only increase in RILF FW over "}]
