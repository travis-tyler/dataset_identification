[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Recent data indicate that 89 percent of 2009 high school ninth graders received a high school diploma four years later. 1 Throughout the last decade, only two-thirds of high school completers attended postsecondary education within the same calendar year that they completed high school. 2 Of those who attended, about two-thirds attended four-year institutions, with the remaining students selecting a two-year college. Many factors may be related to whether a student chooses to attend postsecondary education after completing high school. For example, students' academic ability, family finances, and career aspirations are likely to play a role in their enrollment decisions. Additionally, information students receive in high school from peers, parents, teachers, and counselors may also influence whether, when, and at what level they attend postsecondary education.\nThe analyses use two sets of variables to describe the counseling context at students' high schools. 4 The first set of variables describes the amount and types of counseling available to students, including the proportion of counselors' time spent on college preparation and the different types of help offered by the school to aid students in selecting colleges and securing financial aid. These characteristics were measured at the school level during students' 11 th -grade year, and are shaped directly by counselors, schools, and districts. The second set of variables related to the counseling context was measured at the student level and represents beliefs and behaviors of students and their families that may be influenced by school counseling activities. They include such factors as students' perceptions of college affordability and whether parents met with a counselor to discuss their child's options for life after high school. Most of these factors were also measured during students' 11 th -grade year. This report explores five postsecondary attendance-related outcomes that were reported in 2013, after students completed high school. The first three outcomes capture steps students took to prepare for postsecondary education while they were in high school: 1) whether the student met one on one with a high school counselor to discuss college admissions, 2) whether the student met one on one with a counselor to discuss financial aid, and 3) whether the student submitted a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The fourth and fifth outcomes explore students' actual college going, capturing 4) whether students attended college at all and 5) whether they attended a bachelor's degree program. 5 4 Data on counseling characteristics used in this report were collected in 2012 from the schools that students attended as ninth graders in 2009. For the 11 percent of high school graduates who changed schools between Fall 2009 and Spring 2012, the counseling characteristics they experienced in 11th grade may have differed from what was reported by their ninth-grade school in 2012. However, they would have experienced their ninth-grade school's counseling characteristics for at least some of high school. Two percent of graduates transferred during ninth grade, 5 percent transferred during 10th grade, and 4 percent transferred during 11th grade. For more information on data collection, see the Data and Methods Appendix. 5 Data for the 2013 Update were collected between June and December 2013. Outcomes for students interviewed in the beginning of the data collection period captured anticipated attendance as of November 2013, whereas outcomes for students interviewed toward the end of data collection captured actual attendance as of November 2013. For more information on data collection, see the Data and Methods Appendix. Main findings from the analyses include the following: \u2022 First, several characteristics of the counseling programs in students' schools were related to whether students met one on one with a high school counselor to discuss college admissions or financial aid. \u2022 Second, whether a student met one on one with a high school counselor to discuss college admissions or financial aid was related to the student's likelihood of completing a FAFSA, attending postsecondary education, and attending a bachelor's degree program. \u2022 Third, several student characteristics that counselors may be able to influence were also related to students' postsecondary outcomes. These characteristics include whether a student participated in a program that provided college preparation, the proportion of the student's close friends planning to attend a four-year college, parents' expectations in ninth grade for their child's highest postsecondary degree attainment, whether the student spoke with a counselor in ninth grade about going to college, and whether parents spoke with a counselor about their child's options for life after high school by 11 th grade. Part I of this report summarizes the characteristics of 2009 ninth graders who completed high school by 2013. Part II presents results, using both descriptive statistics and regression analysis to examine the relationships between the high school counseling context and students' postsecondary attendance outcomes. The regression results measure these relationships while holding other school and student characteristics constant. These results are generally similar to the findings from the descriptive statistics. The report's conclusion synthesizes the results across the students' various postsecondary attendance-related decisions. The analyses in this report focus on 2009 ninth graders who completed high school on time, i.e., students who graduated with a diploma or earned a General Education Development (GED) credential or other high school equivalency credential four years after their 2009 ninth grade year. 6 This subset of 2009 ninth graders would have been eligible to enter postsecondary education in Fall 2013. 7 All analyses focus specifically on high school completers; however, throughout the report, findings may sometimes refer to \"students\" instead of \"high school completers.\" To help inform the results in the subsequent sections of the report, Part I provides a portrait of these 2013 high school completers, focusing on factors thought to be related to postsecondary attendance. This portion of the report first presents these students' demographic characteristics. It then addresses the counseling characteristics of the schools that students attended and the student characteristics that counselors may have been able to influence. The overview concludes by examining these students' preparation for and participation in postsecondary education as of 2013."}, {"section_title": "The two previous NACAC reports in this series, Preparing Students for College: What High Schools Are Doing and How Their Actions Influence Ninth Graders' College Attitudes, Aspirations and Plans and A National Look at the High School Counseling Office: What Is It Doing and What Role Can It Play in Facilitating Students' Paths to", "text": "College, explored the various high school counseling services available to students across the nation and investigated the relationships between these high school counseling characteristics and students' college plans in their junior year of high school.

Overall, about half (51 percent) of 2013 high school completers were female (Table 1). Fifty-three percent of completers were white, 13 percent were black, 21 percent were Hispanic, and 4 percent were Asian. The vast majority of completers attended a public high school; only 8 percent attended private high schools. About twofifths of completers (38 percent) had a parent who had earned a bachelor's degree, and another two-fifths (40 percent) had parents with no postsecondary education. About two-thirds of completers, 65 percent, planned when they were in ninth grade to enroll in an associate's or bachelor's degree program after high school. Sixteen percent of high school completers were from the lowest quintile of 11 th -grade mathematics scores, while 24 percent were from the highest quintile of scores."}, {"section_title": "COUNSELOR CHARACTERISTICS", "text": "Counselors have many demands on their time. They must divide their time among students' school and personal problems, high school course scheduling, academic testing, job placement, career planning, and college preparation. For this analysis, the characteristics of the counseling programs in students' ninth-grade schools were measured in 2012, when most students were in 11 th grade. 8 Sixteen percent of 2009 ninth graders who completed high school on time had attended a school where counselors spent 10 percent or less of their time on college preparation (Table 1). Thirty-eight percent had attended a school where counselors spent 11 to 20 percent of their time on college preparation, and about half (47 percent) had attended a school where counselors spent 21 percent or more of their time on college preparation. About two-fifths (41 percent) of on-time high school completers attended a high school where at least one counselor's primary responsibility was assisting students with college applications or college selection. High school counseling programs engage in a variety of activities to help students prepare for postsecondary education and future careers. Ninety-two percent of completers had attended a school that held or participated in a college fair, 98 percent attended a school that helped students identify criteria for selecting colleges, 76 percent attended a school that sent out reminders of FAFSA deadlines, 88 percent attended a school that offered informational meetings on sources of financial aid, and 78 percent attended a school that helped students and families complete the FAFSA. 9\n\n"}, {"section_title": "STUDENT CHARACTERISTICS THAT COUNSELORS MAY BE ABLE TO INFLUENCE", "text": "Students' and their families' beliefs and behaviors related to postsecondary education may be influenced by counselors and may also affect students' receptivity to other counseling activities. For example, student perceptions of college affordability in 11 th grade may have been influenced by high school counseling efforts during ninth or 10 th grades. In addition, students' perceptions of college affordability may make them more or less likely to take advantage of counseling resources concerning college attendance. Other student and parent characteristics that are related to postsecondary preparation and could affect or be affected by counseling activities include student participation in programs that provided college preparation, the proportion of a student's close friends who planned to attend a fouryear college, parents' expectations for their child's postsecondary attendance, whether a student met with a counselor in ninth grade to discuss going to college, and whether a parent met with a counselor by 11 th grade to discuss their child's options for life after college. 8 See footnote 4 and the Data and Methods Appendix for more details. 9 This report focuses on these counseling characteristics. For more information on a greater number of activities pursued by counselors, see the two previous NACAC reports in this series: Attended a bachelor's degree program in Fall 2013 50 12,500 1 \"Other race\" includes non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives, non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders, and students of more than one race. 2 Includes college preparation camp, Upward Bound, Talent Search, GEAR UP, AVID, and/or MESA. Note: The counseling characteristics were asked when students were in 11th grade of staff at the student's base-year school, even if the student had transferred to a new school. By 11th grade, 11 percent of high school graduates had transferred to another high school (2 percent during their ninth-grade year, 5 percent during their 10thgrade year, and 4 percent during their 11th-grade year). Estimates were weighted by W3W1W2STU.  Among 2013 high school completers who were ninth graders in 2009, about half (49 percent) agreed that college was affordable, and 21 percent strongly agreed (Table 1). One-fifth (21 percent) had participated by 11 th grade in a program that prepared students for college. One-half (51 percent) reported that a majority of their friends planned to attend a four-year college after high school graduation. About a third (31 percent) of high school completers had parents who expected their highest postsecondary degree to be a bachelor's degree, and another 42 percent had parents who expected them to earn a graduate degree. Some 18 percent of high school completers had spoken with a counselor in ninth grade about going to college, and 50 percent of completers had a parent who had spoken with a counselor about the student's options for life after high school by the time the child was in 11 th grade.\nMeeting with a Counselor to Discuss College Admissions or Financial Aid Only 65 percent of students who did not meet with a counselor in 12 th grade to discuss college admissions or financial aid attended postsecondary education in Fall 2013, compared with 87 percent of students who met with a counselor ( Figure 6). The regression analysis confirms that there is a strong relationship between meeting with a counselor to discuss college admissions or financial aid and attending college, even controlling for other factors. 18 It is unlikely that sending out reminders of FAFSA deadlines is harmful to students' college attendance. More likely there is variation across schools in students' socioeconomic background that is not being completely controlled for in the regression model. For example, the previous NACAC report A National Look at the High\nMeeting with a Counselor to Discuss College Admissions or Financial Aid Only 36 percent of students who did not meet with a counselor during 12th grade to discuss college admissions or financial aid attended a bachelor's degree program in Fall 2013, compared with 57 percent of students who met with a counselor (Figure 7). The regression analysis confirms that meeting with a counselor to discuss college admissions or financial aid had a positive and significant effect on bachelor's degree attendance. Students who met with a counselor to discuss college admissions or financial aid had odds of pursuing a bachelor's degree program that were twice as high as those of students who did not meet with a counselor to discuss these topics (Table 6)."}, {"section_title": "OUTCOMES", "text": "A majority of completers attended postsecondary education by 2013 or had taken steps toward doing so. Seventy-eight percent of high school completers reported that, during their senior year of high school, they met one on one with a high school counselor to discuss admission to college, and 55 percent reported meeting with a counselor to discuss financial aid (Table 1). About three-quarters (76 percent) of high school completers submitted a FAFSA, which is critical because, without submitting a FAFSA, students have no access to federal loans and grants, severely limiting their ability to receive any financial aid. Four-fifths (80 percent) of completers attended some postsecondary education in Fall 2013, and half of completers started in a bachelor's degree program. The next section details the relationship between these outcomes and the counseling context at the student's high school. Part II examines in more depth the postsecondary outcomes of 2009 ninth graders who completed high school on time. Each outcome first includes descriptive statistics that connect that outcome with a school's counseling context (counseling context includes both counselor characteristics and student characteristics that counselors may be able to influence). The specific types of counseling characteristics explored vary across outcomes. Some counseling characteristics are more likely to be related to some outcomes than to others, so each analysis focuses on the most pertinent counseling characteristics. 10 The figures in this section depict the subset of counseling characteristics that have a statistically significant relationship to the outcomes in both the descriptive figures and subsequent regression analysis. 11 A full set of the descriptive statistics examined for each outcome are available in Appendix Tables A1 and A2. Following these descriptive findings are results from regression analyses. The regression analyses capture the relationships between the counseling context and the students' outcomes, while holding constant other school and student characteristics related to postsecondary entry. Holding these factors constant is important because counseling context variables and students' demographic characteristics are often related to one another. For example, such student attributes as high school type (public or private), 11 th -grade mathematics score, parents' highest level of education, students' postsecondary degree goals, and students' race/ethnicity and gender are often related to both the counseling students receive and their postsecondary outcomes. The regressions therefore include these demographic variables to isolate their effects from those of the counseling variables."}, {"section_title": "Outcome 1: Meeting One on One with a Counselor to Discuss College Admissions During 12th Grade", "text": "Meeting with a counselor to discuss college admissions may serve as a first step toward attending college and may provide students with information they need to make an informed postsecondary decision. 12 12 There is no information on whether this meeting was initiated by the student or the counselor but, regardless,  The amount of time counselors spend on college preparation corresponds positively with meetings with students. Among completers who attended high schools where counselors spent 10 percent or less of their time on college preparation, 71 percent of completers had met one on one with a counselor to discuss college admissions (Figure 1). In contrast, 77 percent of completers who attended schools where counselors spent 11 to 20 percent of their time on college preparation had done so, as did 83 percent of completers who attended schools where counselors spent 21 percent of their time or more on college preparation. Regression results indicate that, even after controlling for student and school characteristics, the time counselors spent on college preparation was related to whether high school completers met with counselors to discuss college admissions. Compared with students who attended schools where counseling staff spent 10 percent or less of their time on college preparation, students who attended schools where counselors spent 11 to 20 percent of their time on college preparation had 41 percent higher odds 13 of meeting with a counselor to discuss college admissions (Table 2).

Actions that may be particularly likely to foster meetings between students and counselors include schools offering access to college fairs and helping students identify criteria for selecting colleges. About 72 percent of students who attended a high school that did not offer a college fair met with a counselor to discuss college admissions, compared with 80 percent of students who attended schools that offered college fairs ( Figure 1). Whether students' schools held a college fair was also significantly related to meeting with a counselor to discuss college admissions once controls were added in the regression model. Compared with their peers whose schools did not offer college fairs, students who attended schools that participated in college fairs had 37 percent higher odds of meeting with a counselor to discuss college admissions (Table 2). 14\nForty-seven percent of completers who attended schools that did not offer informational meetings on sources of aid met with a counselor to discuss financial aid, compared with 56 percent of students at schools that offered such help (Figure 3). Whether a school offered informational meetings on sources of financial aid was related to meeting with a counselor to discuss financial aid in the regression model as well.

Examining the regression results simultaneously across the five outcomes can help synthesize which counseling factors are most strongly related to students entering postsecondary education. As Table 7 indicates, several of the counseling characteristics were significantly related to meeting with counselors either about college admissions or financial aid (outcomes 1 and 2). Although none of these characteristics was related to both outcomes, several were related to one, including the percentage of time counselors spent on college preparation, whether the school had a counselor whose primary responsibility was college applications or selection, whether the school held or participated in a college fair, and whether the school offered informational meetings on sources of financial aid. Only two of these counseling characteristics, however, were related to outcomes 3, 4, and 5, and the effects were in the opposite direction expected. 22 Whether a school sent out FAFSA deadline reminders was inversely related to postsecondary attendance; and the percentage of hours counseling staff spent on college readiness, selection, and applications was inversely related to bachelor's degree program attendance. The finding that most counseling characteristics were not directly related to students' postsecondary outcomes indicates that these counseling characteristics are related to the outcomes indirectly, that is, because they encourage one-on-one meetings with a counselor to discuss college applications or financial aid, which in turn is related to postsecondary attendance. Specifically, students' meeting one on one with a counselor to discuss financial aid was predictive of FAFSA submission. Additionally, students' meeting one on one with a counselor to discuss college admissions or financial aid predicted both college attendance and bachelor's degree program attendance. The effects of these one-on-one meetings with counselors were considerable. The one-on-one meetings increased the odds of the last three outcomes (FAFSA submission, postsecondary attendance, and bachelor's degree program attendance) 6.8, 3.2, and 2.0 times, respectively (Tables 4, 5, and 6). Also significant for most outcomes were 1) participation in a program that provided college preparation (three outcomes), 2) the proportion of a student's close friends who planned to attend a four-year college 22 See footnotes 18 and 20 for possible explanations. (four outcomes), and 3) parents' educational expectations for their child (all five outcomes). Whether the student met with a counselor in ninth grade to discuss going to college and whether a parent met with a counselor to discuss the child's options for life after high school were significant predictors of whether students met with counselors to discuss college admissions or financial aid during 12 th grade only. All of the control variables were also related to the postsecondary outcomes examined. Students' high school type, 11 th -grade math achievement, parents' highest level of education, college plans in ninth grade, race/ethnicity, and gender predicted students' postsecondary outcomes independent of the counseling context factors. This is not surprising given that these controls were included specifically because of their known relationship with postsecondary attendance."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS", "text": "This report used both descriptive statistics and regression models to measure the relationship between the counseling context at students' high schools and students' postsecondary outcomes. The majority of the statistically significant relationships measured in this report appeared in both types of analyses. The goal of this report was to measure the relationships between a school's counseling context and students' postsecondary attendance outcomes but not to demonstrate causal relationships. Even though the logistic regression models controlled for a host of student characteristics, many unobserved student factors (e.g., grit and determination, social and emotional characteristics, and other family influences) could affect the postsecondary outcomes examined. Therefore, the findings indicate correlations and do not prove that counseling characteristics cause certain student outcomes. Nevertheless, the analyses do indicate that many counseling characteristics and student characteristics that counselors may be able to influence were consistently and sometimes quite strongly related to whether students met with a counselor to discuss college admissions and financial aid. In turn, whether a student met with a counselor to discuss these topics was related to the likelihood of FAFSA submission, postsecondary attendance, and bachelor's degree program attendance. This research suggests that many actions a counselor takes may have a key impact on students' postsecondary attendance.  data from the first follow-up of HSLS:09, which took place during 2011-12, when on-time students were in 11 th grade. The current report uses data from the 2013 Update to HSLS:09, which took place in summer or fall of 2013, when on-time students had just finished high school. HSLS:09 is the fifth in a series of longitudinal studies conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) since 1972. NCES designed each of these studies to provide data on students' paths through high school and into the labor market and postsecondary education. In each study, students, including those who leave high school without graduating, complete an initial academic assessment and survey in the base year of the study. They also complete follow-up surveys multiple times during and after their high school years. To obtain information regarding these students' school and family experiences, data are also collected from parents, teachers, school administrators, and school counselors during some waves of data collection. The following sections briefly describe the design of HSLS:09 and the methods employed in these analyses, with the goal of providing readers with contextual information for interpreting the findings in this report. HSLS:09 DATA Overview HSLS:09 began with a sample of 944 U.S. public and private high schools. 23 Because HSLS:09 is a sample of ninth graders in high schools, ninth graders in other types of schools, such as middle schools, were not included. Each high school provided a list of all ninth graders enrolled in Fall 2009, and a sample of approximately 25,000 eligible students was selected. Data collection in 2009 included a questionnaire and a mathematics assessment completed by each student, as well as questionnaires completed by the students' parents, mathematics and science teachers, school administrator, and the lead counselor in the school. The first follow-up, conducted in 2012, also included a student questionnaire and mathematics assessment, as well as a survey of the principal and counselor (typically a lead counselor) of each student's 2009 school. Both the principals and counselors reported on characteristics and activities of the school but not on individual students. For students who had transferred to a different school between the base year in 2009 and the first follow-up in 2012, one school 23 The original sample contained 1,889 schools, and 944 schools agreed to participate in the survey. administrator from each transfer school was asked to complete an abbreviated version of the school administrator questionnaire. Counselors at transfer schools were not asked to complete a questionnaire. Therefore the counselor characteristics used in this analysis come from the base-year school for all students, regardless of transfer, although the characteristics used were measured in 2012 (and not the base year). So for the 11 percent of high school completers who transferred between the base year and 2012, the counselor information in the analysis describes a school they attended at some point but not a school they attended at the end of their 11 th grade year. (Two percent of completers left their base-year school during ninth grade, 5 percent transferred during 10 th grade, and 4 percent transferred during 11 th grade.) 24 The first follow-up data collection also included parent surveys, providing data on individual students' families and home lives, which were administered for a subsample of parents. Approximately 21,000 students completed a first follow-up student survey, and almost 9,000 had a first follow-up survey from their parents. The 2013 Update survey took place between June and December 2013. The survey, which could have been completed by either the sample member or a parent, was designed to gather basic information about the sample member's high school completion status, postsecondary education and work plans, and the college application and financial aid process. Questions were adapted so that parent respondents could provide information about their child's activities and plans, although some subjective questions (e.g., about the reasons for choosing a college) were also asked, and responses may systematically differ between parents and children. The survey was administered over a number of months that preceded and overlapped with the traditional start of college classes in the fall. Therefore, a number of questions were anchored to November 1, 2013, and designed to elicit the anticipated or realized activities of respondents on a common date. In total, approximately 19,000 sample members had a 2013 Update response."}, {"section_title": "Sample Weights and Missing Information", "text": "In all of its sample surveys, NCES provides weights that analysts may use to ensure that estimates obtained from the sample respondents represent statistics for the national population. For example, because some students failed to have a 2013 Update survey, a weight was computed for each student so that estimates generated from the 2013 Update data take into account 2013 Update nonresponse. Each analysis in this report used the weight W3W1W2STU, which is intended for analyses that use data from the base year, first follow-up in 2012, and 2013 Update. This weight makes the analyses representative of all Fall 2009 ninth-grade students as of Summer/ Fall 2013. The weight adjusts for students who did not participate in one wave of data collection or another and therefore are missing whole surveys. Students who submit a survey, however, do not always respond to all the questions, and, if a student does not answer a question, the variable is missing for that student. For some variables, statisticians imputed such missing data, that is, they estimated a value for each student who did not respond to the question. Statisticians do not impute date for every variable, however, and students who are missing information on a variable are dropped from logistic regression analysis. Dropping these students decreases the sample size and raises concerns that the sample may no longer be representative. To retain all observations in the analysis, binary dummy variables for missing control variables were added to the model. 25 Because the odds ratios for these missing variable indicators are not interesting in themselves, they are not reported in the results.

For example, schools that serve students with higher family incomes may be more likely to have a counselor whose primary responsibility is college admissions. To begin to tease apart the independent effects of characteristics that covary, this report includes results from logistic regression analyses that estimate the effect of a given counseling or student characteristic on an outcome of interest while taking into account the effects of other student and school characteristics. For example, if a school characteristic (e.g., whether the school's counseling staff spends a large portion of its time on college preparation) is less common among public schools than private schools, logistic regressions estimate the independent effects of these variables on student outcomes. In this example, the effect of attending a school where the counseling staff spends more of its time on college preparation is estimated separately from the effect of whether the school is public or private."}, {"section_title": "Odds Ratios", "text": "Logistic regressions are used in this report because the outcomes are binary (i.e., a student did something or the student did not), and the results of the regressions are expressed as odds ratios. To understand odds ratios, it can be useful to review the concept of odds, which is related to percentages. Odds, in simple terms, are the ratio of the number of times an event occurs to the number of times it does not occur (or vice versa). As noted in the report, for example, 80 percent of students whose high school held a college fair met with a counselor to discuss college admissions, compared with 72 percent of students whose schools did not hold a college fair (Figure 1). In this example, the odds that the first group (those whose schools held a college fair) met with a counselor are 4 to 1. The 4 is computed as follows: 80/(100-80). The odds that the second group (those whose schools did not hold a college fair) met with a counselor are 2.6 to 1, where the 2.6 is computed in the same way: 72/(100-72). Although both the percentages and the odds indicate that those whose schools held a college fair are more likely to meet with a counselor, the numerical values of these two measures are different, and the relationship between these two sets of values is not intuitive. An odds ratio can be used to represent the relationship between the odds that the members of two groups experience the same outcome. The odds ratio is calculated by dividing the odds for the first group by the odds for the second group. An odds ratio of 1.000 indicates that the odds of the two groups are the same. An odds ratio greater than 1.000 indicates that students in the first group are more likely than those in the second group to experience the outcome. Odds ratios of less than 1.000 indicate that students in the first group are less likely than those in the second group to experience the outcome. In the example discussed above, the odds ratio corresponding to whether college fairs are related to meeting with a counselor is 4/2.6 or 1.538. This ratio indicates that the odds that a student meets with a counselor are 54 percent higher among students whose schools held a college fair than among students whose schools did not. The odds ratio above was calculated from simple percentages. In logistic regressions, the odds ratio for an independent variable is computed taking into account, or adjusting for, the relationships among all the other independent variables in the model. For example, the adjusted odds ratio for the effect of college fairs on whether a student meets with a counselor is 1.370 (Table 2). This indicates that, once other variables are taken into consideration, students whose schools hold a college fair have 37 percent higher odds of meeting with a counselor. The difference between these two odds ratios, 1.538 -1.370, or 0.168, occurs because whether a student speaks with a counselor covaries with other variables in the model that also have a relationship with whether a student attends a school that holds a college fair. Each of the adjusted odds ratios in this report has been tested for statistical significance at various confidence levels. Statistically significant odds ratios are indicated with asterisks (indicating they are significant at the 0.05 level or lower).
