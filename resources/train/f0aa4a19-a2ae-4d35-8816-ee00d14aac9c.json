[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Many nonmarket valuation models, such as the"}, {"section_title": "", "text": "The traditional Ricardian model is a cross sectional analysis that measures the long term impacts of climate change on agriculture (Robert Mendelsohn, William Nordhaus, and Daigee Shaw 1994) (MNS) . The technique has been applied successfully in over 27 countries across the world (Robert Mendelsohn and Ariel Dinar 2009). Oliver Deschenes and Michael Greenstone (DG) (2007) recently extend the Ricardian method by applying it to panel data in the US. Using repeated cross sectional analysis, they find the results are not stable over time. They argue that intertemporal methods that eliminate cross sectional variation and focus on year to year changes in weather are preferred.\nWe argue that in this particular application of panel data, the intertemporal data is simply not as useful as the cross sectional variation. The purpose is to measure the impacts of climate change on agriculture. Interannual changes in weather are a poor proxy for climate. Weather changes are surprises to farmers. Farmers only have limited opportunities to adapt to weather. In contrast, climate is long run weather. Farmers can do a great deal to adapt to changes in climate. DG use a series of independent cross sectional regressions to estimate a set of Ricardian Models. They find that, at least for this application of the Ricardian method, the results across the regressions are not stable. They raise doubts about using cross sectional valuation methods at all.\nIn this paper, we argue that the poor results found by DG were due to misspecifications of their model. If carefully specified, the results are robust. We present two panel data approaches, a two stage model by Cheng Hsiao (2008) and a single stage \"pooled\" model. Using US data from the same Census time periods as the DG study, we show that both panel data approaches yield stable results. The results imply that panel methods would likely work not only for Ricardian studies but also for other cross sectional models such as hedonic and travel cost studies.\nIn order to compare the results in DG and our panel data method, however, we must first correct a number of technical problems in the DG analysis. First, DG fail to use a consistent welfare estimator when comparing coefficients across models. Second, DG do a poor job of inferring climate in counties across the US (as first noted by Anthony Fisher et al., 2008) . Third, DG omit a substantial fraction of counties with agriculture in the United States. Fourth, DG fail to correct for the lognormal distribution of farmland values in the US. Fifth, several important explanatory variables are not included in the DG analysis."}, {"section_title": "I. Methodology", "text": "The Ricardian method assumes the value of farmland ( ) V is equal to the present value of net revenue from farm related activities (MNS, 1994) . Land values are therefore equal to:\nwhere V is the value of farmland per hectare, P is the market price of output, Q is output, I is a vector of purchased inputs (other than land), C is a vector of climate variables, G is a vector of geographic variables, S is a vector of soil variables, R is a vector of input prices, t is time and \u03b4 is the discount rate. Farmers are assumed to maximize net revenues by choosing I, given climate, soil, geographic variables, market prices, and other exogenous socio-economic conditions. Solving (1) to maximize net revenue, reveals a reduced form model where V is strictly a function of the exogenous variables facing a farmer: S, G, C, R, r, and Z. In this paper, we focus on applying the Ricardian model to a panel data set. For expositional purposes, we group these variables into a vector of time varying variables, X, a vector of time invariant control variables Z, and a vector of climate variables C. The time varying variables include population density, income, subsidies, and residential housing prices. The time invariant variables (at least over the panel) include soil and geographic variables. The Ricardian model has the general form:\nTraditionally, the Ricardian model is estimated across a single cross section:\nThe relationship between the climate variables and land value is assumed to be quadratic so that the climate vector includes squared terms. Because the effect of climate on land value varies across seasons (MNS 1994), temperature and precipitation are introduced for each of four seasons. The estimated coefficients in the model are \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03c6. Following DG, we control for heteroscedasticity with Weighted Least Squares (WLS). As with DG, we use farmland by county in each year for a weight.\nDG explore estimating this cross sectional model using repeated independent cross sections. They estimate the following model with panel data: However, we argue that the DG model is mispecified. The coefficients of the time varying variables should not change over time. In an ideal panel data model, the coefficients of the time invariant variables should also not change. The correctly specified Ricardian model is:\nwhere \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03c6 are time invariant vectors.\nWe explore two ways to estimate the Ricardian model with panel data. One way is to pool the entire data set and estimate the model above in a single stage using Equation (5). The second approach is to estimate two stages (Cheng Hsiao 2008) . In the first stage, land value is regressed on the time varying variables using the covariance method with county fixed effects:\nwhere e is a vector of county fixed effects (dummies), and t i, \u03b5 is the resulting error term. In the second stage, the time-mean residuals are regressed on the time invariant variables: \nwhere the coefficients associated with climate are allowed to vary over time. The model is equivalent to creating a set of time dummies for each year and interacting these time dummies with the climate variables. Instead of a single set of coefficients for the climate variables, one has a different estimate for each year.\nWith the \"pooled\" model, we interact the climate variables with year dummies. They are then combined with the time varying variables in a single regression on land value:\nThis model yields a set of coefficients for all the climate variables for each year. One can then test whether the coefficients are stable over time.\nThe welfare impact W of climate change on US agriculture is obtained by computing the difference between the value of farmland under the new climate and the value of farmland under the current climate. We find that DG make a technical error when computing the welfare effects.\nDG use the following equation:\nOne reason that welfare changes in each time period in the DG estimation is that they use a different level for farmland in each year. In order to test whether the climate coefficients are stable over time, we use the same level of farmland in every year. In this case, we use the expected value of farmland in each county:\nOf course, the best forecast of welfare effects in the future should rely on the expected value of farmland in the future. This would require modeling not only how farmland is expected to change over time from technological and economic forces but also how it might change in response to climate change (Robert Mendelsohn, William Nordhaus, and Daigee Shaw 1996) . In the present analysis we employ a less sophisticated approach and we use as expected value of farmland the average number of acres in farm over the Census years.\nBecause the underlying dependent variable (farmland value per hectare) is lognormally distributed, we rely on a log linear functional form for this model 2 . Whereas the linear model assumes that climate has an additive effect on land value, the log linear model assumes that climate is going to have a proportional effect on land value. Most of the analyses in this paper, unless otherwise specified, use the natural log of the value of land per hectare as the dependent variable."}, {"section_title": "II. Data", "text": "Following DG, we have constructed a balanced panel with observations from the contiguous 48 States over the U.S. Agricultural Census years of 1978, 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997 and 2002 July, August) and autumn (September, October, November). In contrast, DG use just the single months of January, April, July, and October to represent the four seasons.\nFor farmland value, land in farms, and other agricultural data, we rely on the U.S. Census of Agriculture (USDA 1978 (USDA , 1982 (USDA , 1987 (USDA , 1992 (USDA , 1997 (USDA , 2002 . The dependent variable in our panel is the average estimated value of land and buildings per hectare of land in farm.\nWe include several variables not used in DG. We measure the long-term availability of water to farmers using the average over time of fresh surface water used at the county level (United States Geological Survey, 1988 , 1993 , 1998 , 2004 . We combine the annual surface water data from 1985, 1990, 1995 and 2000 to compute the long-run availability of surface water. This long run access to surface water can be largely considered as exogenous, depending on long term surface flows and historical rights for water use rather than on markets (Robert Mendelsohn and Ariel Dinar, 2003) . Data about greenhouses and subsidies to farmers by county are included from the Census of Agriculture. We use the median value of owner-occupied housing in each county as a proxy of the opportunity cost of keeping land in farms. These data are available at the county level from the US Census of Population and Housing every ten years.\nWe construct estimates of house values extrapolating linear trends from the three Census years of 1980, 1990 and 2000."}, {"section_title": "III. Results", "text": "In this paper, we argue that it is critical to specify the panel data model correctly. It is not appropriate to estimate repeated cross sectional regressions with panel data. We wish to compare the DG repeated cross sectional results with the desired panel results. However, there are many problems with the DG analysis that make the results different. We begin by adjusting for each of these problems so that we can make a fair comparison between the repeated cross sectional approach and the correctly specified panel model. We begin in Table 1 with the estimated welfare results from DG in column 1. All these welfare comparisons examine the impact of a uniform climate change of 2.7\u02daC with an 8 percent increase in precipitation. In column 2, we estimate the results with the same set of counties but an improved set of climate variables. As noted by Anthony Fisher et al (2008), correcting for climate makes a large difference in the welfare estimates from what DG reported, smoothing out many of the differences across years.\nIn column 3, we calculate welfare using the expected level of farmland. Although there are large changes in the amount of farmland in each county across time, holding farmland constant makes only a small difference in the aggregate welfare estimates. In column 4, we expand the sample to include almost all agricultural counties in the US. Expanding the data set to include almost all agricultural counties makes a large difference. The full data set suggests the welfare variation across years is larger. For the remaining analyses, we rely on the corrected climate data, the expected value of farmland, and the sample of 2914 counties. Column 2 changes the functional form from linear to loglinear. The loglinear functional form predicts much larger benefits from warming than the linear functional form and slightly increases the range of results across years. The third column in Table 2 Using the same data set, functional form, and variables as in the last column of The coefficients of the time invariant variables in the Hsiao and pooled models in Table 3B are not significantly different. The major difference between the two models is that the tstatistics of the Hsiao model are higher. On the one hand, the Hsiao model treats the panel as though it was a single cross section whereas the pooled model treats the repeated cross sections as though they were independent. In practice there may be consistent errors across time suggesting that the truth lies in between the two models. The confidence intervals for the welfare impacts of climate change in Table 4 have been derived by the bootstrap method using 2,000 repetitions. The welfare estimates have very large error bands around them. This may seem surprising given the tight estimates of the individual climate coefficients. However, many of the highly significant seasonal climate variables work in opposite directions so that the net annual effect is small and insignificant.\nIn order to test whether the panel models do a better job of stabilizing coefficients compared to the repeated cross sectional model, we must estimate time varying coefficients with the panel model. In Table 5 "}, {"section_title": "III. Conclusion", "text": "This paper examines the possibility of using panel data to estimate cross sectional valuation models such as the Ricardian model. Repeated cross sectional analyses such as presented in DG are not robust. We argue that this is because they are mispecified. The coefficients of time varying and time invariant variables are allowed to vary over time in the repeated cross sections.\nWe argue the correctly specified model holds these coefficients constant.\nWe explore two panel data models that are properly specified. The result is a highly significant model that predicts climate coefficients with a high degree of accuracy. The results of the analysis of weather and climate are quite different. Whereas every farmer in the world is concerned about weather, the effect of climate will vary a great deal depending on where a farm is located. Farms in relatively cool locations will benefit but farms in warmer locations are likely to be hurt. Even within the United States, farms in the northern US may see large benefits whereas farms along the southern edges of the US will be harmed. This study develops a panel data method for estimating Ricardian models. The results reveal that the climate coefficients are far more accurate than coefficients from repeated cross sections.\nThe results suggest that many cross sectional valuation methods may benefit from panel data provided they estimate their panel data models correctly."}, {"section_title": "DATA APPENDIX", "text": "We have constructed a balanced panel with observations for 2,914 counties in the contiguous 48\nStates over the years 1978, 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997 and 2002 .
