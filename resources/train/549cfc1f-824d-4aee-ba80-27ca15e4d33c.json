Perceived fatigability was assessed using the Borg rating of perceived exertion scale after a 5-minute treadmill walk (0.67 m/s, 0% grade). Linear models were used to assess the association between baseline CVD risk and perceived fatigability an average of 4.5 years later, adjusted for demographics, behaviors, and medical history. In final models, a 5% higher baseline Pooled Cohort Equation score was associated with greater perceived fatigability at follow-up (b=0.13 rating of perceived exertion, P=0.008). Stratified analyses suggested this association was stronger among those aged \u226470 years and those with obesity. Of the individual CVD risk score components, older age was most strongly associated with perceived fatigability (b=0.48, P<0.001), followed by women (b=0.11, P=0.002), and treated hypertension (b=0.11, P=0.003). There was no association with the Framingham risk score.\nConclusions--Perceived fatigability was higher among participants with greater CVD risk measured using the Pooled Cohort Equation risk score. The strong associations with hypertension and obesity suggest prevention and promotion of cardiovascular health may also lower perceived fatigability, particularly among those aged \u226470 years or living with obesity.

Efforts to prevent CVD and its associated health outcomes are thus paramount to preserving health and functional status in a rapidly aging population.\nFatigue is a common complaint among older adults and a prominent symptom among those with chronic cardiovascular conditions. 6 Because of its subjective nature, the severity of fatigue is often difficult to quantify and define, as it is confounded by reductions in the amount and/or intensity of physical activity as older adults adjust their exertion levels to attenuate or avoid fatigue. In this context, people reporting a similar level of fatigue could differ dramatically in terms of physical capacity, 7 thus potentially under-or-over-stating the true magnitude and intensity of the association between fatigue and cardiovascular conditions. Fatigability is a relatively recent construct developed and validated in the gerontological literature to better understand the development and progression of fatigue, and associated changes with mobility and functional capacity with aging. 8 Previous research has shown that those with preclinical peripheral artery disease, as indicated by low ankle brachial index, experience greater fatigability and lower walking endurance than those with normal ankle brachial index, 9 suggesting that high fatigability may act as an early indicator of peripheral artery disease. Further, cardiovascular risk factors like arterial stiffness and diabetes mellitus have been positively associated with higher fatigue, 10 ,11 yet the contribution of these risk factors to the development of fatigability has not been defined. Given that most CVD risk factors are modifiable, efforts to prevent the onset and progression of fatigability with aging may benefit from evaluation and management of cardiovascular health earlier in life. Moreover, high fatigability may also act as a symptom of preclinical CVD, assisting with earlier clinical diagnoses.\nAccordingly, this study assesses the association between CVD risk and fatigability measured, on average, 4.5 years later in a population of well-functioning middle-aged and older adults with no history of CVD. In addition, we explored the independent associations between fatigability and factors most commonly associated with CVD risk (eg, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, etc). We hypothesized that people with higher CVD risk would have higher fatigability and that this would be primarily driven by hypertension, given its high prevalence among older adults."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Because of the sensitive nature of the data collected for this study, requests to access the data set from qualified researchers trained in human subject confidentiality protocols may be sent to the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute on Aging at https://blsa.nih.gov."}, {"section_title": "Study Population", "text": "The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) is a study of normative human aging, established in 1958 and conducted by the National Institute on Aging Intramural Research Program.

Given the temporality, these findings illustrate the evolution of the association between CVD risk and perceived fatigability in a cohort of well-functioning older adults who are free of CVD events, and suggest that CVD risk, particularly hypertension, may be an important factor in the development and progression of fatigability in older adults. Previous studies exploring the burden of fatigue among those with CVD have consistently found a positive association between high fatigue and history of CVD events, 5 particularly stroke, 18 but the true burden of fatigue is difficult to discern because of its subjectivity. The current work expands on this research by anchoring fatigue to a standardized physical task and demonstrating a direct link between CVD risk and fatigability among CVD-free older adults.\nIn the current study, the PCE score demonstrated greater discriminatory power to detect the association between CVD risk and fatigability than the Framingham score. This may be because non-black participants demonstrated poorer CVD risk profiles in our population, which was not detected by the Framingham score since it did not include race. Further, our finding that the association between CVD risk and fatigability is stronger among those aged \u226470 years compared with those >70 years may indicate that elevated cardiovascular risk in early-to-mid-life is more deleterious in the development of fatigability compared with later-stage risk. To this end, corresponding interventions to promote cardiovascular health may be most beneficial when implemented in middle-, or even younger-age. Stronger associations between CVD risk and fatigability were also seen among those who are obese. This is consistent with recent findings, suggesting that higher BMI and central adiposity are strongly associated with physical fatigability in older adults. 19, 20 Although there is currently no clinical threshold for using RPE scores to assess fatigability, to put these results in some context we compared the RPE score for CVD burden with the beta coefficients for age from the same regression models. The difference in RPE score corresponding to a 5% higher PCE risk score (0.14 RPE score) was equivalent to nearly 2 years of age, suggesting that relatively small increments in RPE are equivalent to substantial differences in age.\nPrevious research has established an association between chronic fatigue and hypotension, 21 but the association with hypertension has been less studied. Recently, studies focusing on patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack, reported that hypertensive subjects showed higher odds of being fatigued compared with their normotensive counterparts 22 ; however, the cause of the association between hypertension and fatigue remains unclear. Although the potential fatiguing effects of many antihypertension medications, including beta-blockers, has been postulated, 23 our sensitivity analysis did not support this mechanism. Similarly, fatigue is also a persistent symptom among patients with diabetes mellitus, which is believed to be alleviated through improved glycemic control. 24 Our study also indicated that the burden of fatigability is greater among women and those of black race, which are consistent with findings from previous studies on fatigue and health inequities. [25] [26] [27] The mechanisms contributing to higher fatigability among those with higher CVD risk remain to be explored. CVD risk places extra burden on multiple physiologic systems, including the coronary, pulmonary and vascular systems, which may contribute to increased perception of exertion or fatigue after a physical task because of hypoxemia and intermittent claudication. 9 Other possible explanations include high inflammatory burden, immunity dysfunction and sleep disruptions that occur with CVD progression. Previous studies have demonstrated higher inflammatory burden among those with CVD, which may be a direct contributor to higher fatigability. [28] [29] [30] [31] Similarly, immunity cells such as B-cells, T Lymphocytes, and unconventional T cells, are more active among those with CVD, and produce more inflammatory factors under hypertensive conditions. 31 Finally, sleep duration and quality are often impaired among those with hypertension and sleep apnea. 32 Together, these mechanisms may contribute to long-term physiological stress, manifesting as high fatigability and eventual poor physical performance. 33 There are some limitations in the current study that should be considered. First, the BLSA participants are relatively healthy compared with the general older adult population, thus the magnitude of the results is likely understated compared with clinical populations. However, the strength of these results suggests that interventions to reduce CVD risk even in early-to-mid-life among well-functioning populations may be an effective strategy for reducing fatigability with aging. Future studies in sicker, more clinical populations are warranted. Second, there are missing data because of loss to follow-up. Exploratory analyses indicated that the RPE scores are comparable between participants with and without missing data, thus it is unlikely that loss to follow-up altered the results. Some strengths should also be acknowledged. Objective measurement of perceived fatigability attenuates variability in subjective reporting, increasing the sensitivity and thus reducing the potential for misclassification. Further, the extensive data available on CVD risk enabled us to examine the independent and combine effects of CVD burden in the development of fatigability."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In conclusion, higher baseline CVD risk is associated with higher levels of perceived fatigability an average of 4.5 years later among well-functioning older adults free of CVD.
