[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "How many minority and female faculty in a specific discipline are available in the national pool for a new hire? Is a department producing too many. Ph.D.s? These two campus-level, policy questions demonstrate the need for data on benchmarks for faculty hiring. Faculty availability data are at the heart of required affirmative action reports for institutions that receive federal funding (Milam, 1995b). While the climate for affirmative action has changed dramatically in California and other states, a parallel debate about faculty availability is taking place at the nationallevel in response to alarms about the overproduction of Ph.D.s (Geiger, 1997;Massy and Goldman, 1995;SRS Professional Society Workshops, 1995a, 1995b. This paper analyzes the national datasets about faculty and evaluates their utility for addressing policy questions about faculty availability. This work was funded by an NSF -NCES-AIR Research Fellowship for 1996-97. While it is important to review several of the complex econometric approaches and their assumptions about Ph.D. production, the primary purpose of this research is to document specific datasets which may be used for different types of models. A basic pipeline model is presented which demonstrates how several 1993 datasets may be used to conduct more complicated analyses. r,"}, {"section_title": "Literature Review", "text": "Discussion of faculty availability is informed by five distinct literature bases: (1) Scholarship about affirmative action and the pipeline of women and minority faculty in higher education (Bereman and Scott ,1991;Clark and Corcoran, 1986;Cunningham and Hemmeter, 1992;Ethington, 1988;Hal lock, 1994;Hanna, 1988;Harvey and Valadez, 1994;Lie et al., 1994;Opp and Smith, 1994;Reynolds, 1992;Rodriguez, 1994;Schroeder and Mynatt, 1993;Smith, 1994;Tack and Patitu, 1992;and Washington and Harvey, 1989). (2) Documentation of availability data on women and minorities in higher education (Gill, 1992;Milam, 1995aMilam, , 1995bNEBHA, WICHE, and SREB, 1994;Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, 1992;and Vander Maerdt, 1989). (3) A labor economics approach to understanding the supply and demand for faculty in the disciplines, particularly science and engineering (Atkinson, 1990;Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy, 1995;Geiger, 1997;Leslie and Oaxaca, 1990;Massy and Goldman, 1995;McGuire and Price, 1989;Science and Engineering Indicators, 1996;SRS Professional Society Workshops, 1995a, 1995bSyverson, 1997;Syverson and Forster, 1985). (4) Other surveys and research about the nature of higher education faculty, including data about rank, tenure status, activity, workload, productivity, program rankings, research, and retirement (Tang and Chamberlain, 1997;Dooris, 1989, 1991;National Research Council, 1995;National Center for Education Statistics, 1996a, 1996b). (5) Scholarship about the Ph.D. process, including time to degree, mentoring, and postdoctoral programs (Bowen and Rudenstine, 1992;Bowen and Sosk 1989;Stricker, 1994). Each of these approaches offers different assumptions for consideration in developing models of faculty availability. The pipeline scholarship suggests that the entrance of women and minorities into the faculty depends on the climate and nature/tier of the graduate institution, effective mentoring, and faculty diversity for role models, among other factors. Availability -research uses survey data to calculate utilization rates and predict shortages using models based on simple, descriptive statistics. The research of Massy and Goldman (1995) on The Production and Utilization of Science and Engineering Doctorates in the United States, the Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy's (1995) work Reshaping the Graduate Education of Scientists and Engineers, and NSF's Science and Engineering Indicators -1996 chapter on \"Higher Education in Science and Engineering\" are examples of econometric approaches which make complex assumptions about matriculation rates, faculty rank transitions, retirement rates, and departmental activity based on undergraduate enrollment, budgets, and sponsored research funding to estimate the long-term equilibrium of supply and demand. Numerous other efforts focus on understanding topics such as changing patterns in the faculty ranks, tenure status, and the greying of the professoriate. These shifts in demographics can be incorporated into complex models that, for example, account for the growth of non-tenure track positions and the increased use of part-time faculty. Finally, the literature on the Ph.D. process informs models with assumptions about the percent of graduates entering academe, the increase in post-doctoral appointments, unemployment, underemployment, and the segmentation of tiers and types of institutions. Several sets of assumptions emerge from the literature which need to be addressed by policy makers, if only to state whether they are accounted for and whether a particular faculty availability model is therefore limited in its implications. These m6 be grouped by their effect on data about graduate students, Ph.D. recipients, post-doctoral appointments, new assistant professors, and other faculty."}, {"section_title": "Graduate students", "text": "Assumptions need to be made about the effect of the number of bachelor and master',s. degrees on doctoral student supply, the relationship of the master's to the doctorate, breakouts by gender and ethnicity, age, retention, and completion rates. Example questions: How valuable is master's enrollment in predicting supply for Ph.D. programs? What is the impact of funding patterns by field and type of institution on completion? Based on undergraduate and master's enrollments, how many Ph.D. students will be enrolled in five years? Ph.D. recipients Complex models require that assumptions be made about time to degree, matriculation and graduation rates, gender, ethnicity, age, field of specialization/dissertation topics, the effect of different tiers of institutions on marketability, and the percent of recipients entering academe. Example questions: How will the percent of students entering academe vary by field, funding, and tier of institution? Are too many Ph.D. students being produced to meet the demand of academe, government, and industry? Post-doctoral appointments Assumptions need to be made about the growth of post-doctoral appointments and their effect on obtaining positions in academe? Example questions: What percentage of Ph.D. recipients by field go into post-docs? Are post-doc appointments taken because tenure track positions are unavailable or because the nature of the discipline requires advanced study?"}, {"section_title": "New assistant professors", "text": "Assumptions need to be made about the number of new tentiit track, assistant professor slots. This requires complex assumptions about faculty turnover, rank transitions, retirements, etc. Massy and Goldman (1995) suggest that the demand for new hires is driven positively by undergraduate enrollments in a department and departmental budgets and negatively by the amount of sponsored research. Other assumptions need to be made about whether retiring ,..faculty are replaced with tenure track positions or part-time and non-tenure track faculty. Example questions: What is the effect of declining tenure track appointments and the increased use of restricted faculty on Ph.D. demand? How many new faculty are hired each year in a specific discipline?"}, {"section_title": "Other faculty", "text": "Assumptions about faculty turnover, rank transitions, retirement planning, and the effect of early retirement policies need to be taken into account. Increased interdisciplinary work, the feminization of some disciplines, the dissolution of tenure, collective bargaining, and other factors also influence the demand for new faculty hires. Example questions: How has the lifting of mandatory retirement and the greying of the tenured professoriate helped push tenure track positions into non-tenure track? Is most of the growth of women and minorities at the nontenure track level? Has the use of part-time faculty for undergraduate instruction limited the need for full -time faculty altogether? What is the effect of faculty workload policies on the number of faculty needed in a department? In evaluating different datasets, it is important to acknowledge the implicit assumptions and limitations of the data as they impact modeling about the faculty pipeline."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "The primary purpose of this research is to (1) evaluate each ;Ational dataset for its utility in modeling faculty availability and (2) document the types of assumptions need to be addressed in building models based on these datasets. An extensive review was performed of the literature bases detailed above and of related documentation on NSF, NRC, NCES, and other agencies' web sites. This review led to the construction of a critical table (or cross-tab or pivot table) which illustrates the lowest level of aggregation necessary for modeling. This critical cross-tab includes the faculty variables rank within tenure status by gender within ethnicity. The data need to be completed for the lowest taxonomy of a discipline for a single institution. (See table #1 below). Despite the complex stratification, it is necessary to evaluate the validity of the population estimates for postsecondary faculty in comparison to the IPEDS S or SA. For the critical cross-tab, the SDR provides breakouts of gender within race and rank within tenure for a sample of S&E higher education faculty, but only for the 29 postsecondary occupation codes. An example of the limitations of this taxonomytriay be seen in the occupation codes for the group \"Life and Related Sciences,\" which has only four occupation codes: NDRC is the logical source for completions data at the six digit CIP code level by institution. For the critical cross-tab, the completions survey documents the number of doctoral graduates by gender within race by CIP code. The data on masters degrees may be useful for some models of doctoral enrollment demand and for predicting faculty supply for two-year colleges which do not require the Ph.D. It is important to note that the SA includes only full-time instructional faculty. It does not include faculty whose duties are 50% or more in research, service, or administration. For this reason, the SA is the best estimate of the total full-time faculty teaching population. Historical SA data are useful for tracking the growth of non-tenure track positions by type of institution. The SA is comparable to the AAUP faculty survey in the collection of salary and benefits expenditures and can be substituted for AAUP in the calculation of average salaries by rank, which converts twelve month contracts to nine month. For the critical cross-tab, the SA provides aggregate data on gender within rank within tenure at the institutional level. The IPEDS SA and S may be used as population estimates of faculty totals by Carnegie classification and control and can serve as a validity check for other estimates of the total, full-time, instructional faculty population. institutions and collects data only on full-time, instructional faculty. A subset of 30 institutions is analyzed by the University of Alabama for the Southern University Group (SUG). Data are collected for gender, ethnicity, and rank, with a breakout for new assistant professors identical to that of the CUPA survey. In order to be listed in the print reports which aggregate data by discipline, a CIP code must be used by more than a few institutions. If there is no match, the data are rolled into the other (99) version of the four digit CIP code and then to the (01) version of the CIP. Electronic data are provided to participating institutions, allowing institutional research offices to weight the data to match their own profile of disciplines. Reports on faculty salaries by CIP code are published regularly by the University of Oklahoma's institutional research office. Depending upon the office's workload, the additional data on ethnicity are reported in occasional years. Oklahoma will produce special data tabulations without institutional identifiers for a fee. ."}, {"section_title": "t,", "text": "For the critical cross-tab, the Oklahoma survey provides data on gender within ethnicity by rank at the CIP code discipline level, but only for a relatively small, somewhat homogeneous sample of institutions. (11) National Survey of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF) The NSOPF was conducted in 1988 and in 1993 by NCES, with support from NSF and the National Endowment for the Humanities. In 1993, institutional and faculty versions of the survey were used. A department chair survey was administered in 1988. The 1993 NSOPF was administered by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago. NSOPF is the primary survey of faculty activities, demographics, and attitudes. A two stage sampling procedure was used for the faculty questionnaire. First, 974 institutions were contacted, of which 817 agreed to participate. These institutions provided lists of faculty by discipline. Disciplinary data were recorded in order to over-sample four NEH disciplines. The sampling rate was also increased for full-time women and minorities. From the lists, samples with a measure of size of 41.5 faculty (41 or 42) per institution were developed, stratified by Carnegie classification and control. Most public and private research universities and most public doctoral universities were included (with certainty) in the sample. A total of 25,780 surveys were completed for a response rate of 86.6%. In analyzing the NSOPF data for 1988 and 1993, anomalies were detected in the number of part-time and health science faculty. The initial Data Analysis System (DAS) and analyses were revised and re-released after it was determined that the survey was not adequately administered to medical school faculty and that the weights of partFiime faculty were incorrect due to problems in the institutional lists. The part-time issue has been corrected, but NSOPF still under -reports health science faculty. While data on discipline were collected with 149 possible fields, the sample was not stratified by discipline. For this reason and because of the problems with health sciences, the data should not be interpreted by discipline. Even analysis by clusters of disciplines is suspect. The NSOPF data are available for study in a data analysis system (DAS) on CD-Rom from NCES. The CD also includes data on most other non-IPEDS surveys administered through NCES. The Window-based software allows filtered, two dimensional cross-tabs. Two versions of the software are provided, one for regular tables and one that produces correlation matrices for further analysis in SAS or SPSS. The software produces a tab delimited text file with information on weights, Ns, and standard errors. The report Women and Minorit Facult in Science and En ineerin is being prepared by staff of the Pelavin Research Institute (1997) and will also be distributed soon. This is the only report of its kind focused on science and engineering faculty in higher education. Other analyses conducted by NSF on science and engineering faculty are limited in their scope to the SESTAT occupation codes. Basic information about the survey is also available at the NCES web site. It is important to note that the definition of faculty used font..the NSOPF differs from that of the IPEDS S and SA. The institutional lists included full-time, part-time, permanent, temporary, instructional faculty and staff, along with non-instructional faculty. This is an important source of information on part-time and temporary staff The reader must be careful, though, in interpreting tables of NSOPF data to ensure that the correct faculty definition is used. In weighting the sample to the population, NORC first weighted the respondents by institutional type to the lists from institutions (approximately 500,000 faculty names). These data were then weighted again by institution to 17 strata of Carnegie classification and control and the total faculty population as documented in the IPEDS S. The number of strata is uneven because there are no public, religious institutions. For the critical cross-tab, the faculty questionnaire provides data on gender within ethnicity by rank within tenure. Unfortunately, the data need to be aggregated by Carnegie and control and the data on disciplines are not usable because they were not stratified in the sample. This survey is an invitational sample and HERI charges institutions a fee based on the number of faculty surveyed, similar to the administration of the UCLA CIRP Freshmen survey. The publication The American College Teacher: National Norms for the 1995-96 HERI Faculty Survey is sent to participating institutions and is available for purchase from HERI. HERI sends a standard set of cross-tabs of the data to institutions and will prepare additional analysis of data for a fee. \"National Norms\" were developed based on the portion of respondents who code themselves as undergraduate teaching faculty. The norms included all institutions which surveyed a minimum percentage of their faculty population, as determined from analysis of IPEDS reports. The list of participating institutions was examined \"using a 23 cell stratification based on institutional type, selectivity, and control\" (Sax et al, 1996, p. 1 Data on specific faculty were taken from \"various sources of information,\" including the Doctorate Records File of SED data. Using the combination of IC reports and faculty survey instruments, data were gathered about program ratings, Ph.D. recipients, women and minority enrollment and degree patterns, and the number of faculty. In addition to the book Research-Doctorate Programs in the United States: Continuity and Change, various documents and Excel spreadsheets are available on the web. A CD-Rom of the data will be available in a few weeks, according to Jim Voytuk at the National Academy of Sciences. Voytuk believes that since there was a \"Greater number of programs and fields for the 1995 study than was used in 1982\" it is possible to \"use the dati,to project overproduction\" (Voytuk, 1997). For the critical cross-tab, it is possible to document a portion of the number of higher education faculty, but only for the 41 targeted programs and only for the 214 institutions which participated. Information on gender, ethnicity, and tenure status is not collected."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The analysis of the datasets suggests that, while many important policy questions may be studied with the data, it is not possible to complete the critical cross-tabulation of gender within ethnicity by rank within tenure status by discipline at the institution level. With every data source, there are inherent limitations in the instrument, the sampling, or the coding. In order to merge the different datasets, it is necessary to adopt the CASPAR disciplinary taxonomy. If the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) data are to be used, and these are the best source of data on non-S&E post-docs and the percent of doctorate recipients entering academe, the 49 disciplines in.the CASPAR taxonomy must be rolled up to the 29 postsecondary census occupations. This is unfortunate, given the fine level of disciplinary detail built into some of the surveys, particularly the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED). No single dataset is capable of addressing the myriad of policy questions about faculty availability at the required level of aggregation. On the surface, the NSOPF seems closest. HOwever, the lack of stratification by discipline and the problems in sampling health science faculty are significant drawbacks to the survey's utility for this purpose. Many one-and twodimensional tables may be created with the thirteen datasets which are of great importance to policy makers. Complex models of faculty availability for affirmatii'e action and for understanding Ph.D. production require weighting and assumptions based on different datasets. It is possible to create a model of faculty availability which incorporates the best of what scholars can learn from several of the surveys. The components of such a model would include: The universe of doctoral graduates is available by gender within ethnicity at the institution level in the SED and the IPEDS C. The various SED and IPEDS C taxonomies are already crosswalked to CASPAR. These need to be normalized to the 29 postsecondary occupation census codes used in SESTAT. Using the SED, the percent of Ph.D. recipients entering academe may be estimated by gender within race, occupation code, and by Carnegie and control. The validity of the estimates needs to be examined against data from the SED. The percent entering S&E post-doctoral programs in academe may be estimated by gender within ethnicity and by discipline using the GSS. The discipline data must be rolled up to the CASPAR taxonomy and then to the 29 occupation codes. The SDR may be used to estimate the percentage of graduates entering post-docs outside of academe in national labs and industry. The SDR and the NSOPF may also be used to estimate the percentage of graduates entering postdocs in non-S&E disciplines."}, {"section_title": "Faculty", "text": "The SDR, NSRCG, and NSCG datasets may be used to generate estimates of faculty numbers by gender within ethnicity by occupation code and type of-institution (control and Carnegie for the SDR, type of educational institution for the other two SESTAT datasets). These need to be evaluated against data obtained with the Oklahoma survey for public research and doctoral institution percentages.. The SESTAT data are weighted against census estimates for the entire U.S. population. The weights need to be recalculated using the IPEDS S to estimate the total number of full-time and part-time, instructional and research faculty positions in higher education by occupation, broken out by general type of educational institution. Rates for faculty transitions should be calculated by occupation code, gender, ethnicity, rank, tenure, and institutional type from the SDR. These also need to be calculated by rank, tenure, and institutional type from the NSOPF faculty questionnaire. Rates for faculty retirement and attrition may be estimated by occupation code and institutional type from the SDR and by institutional type from the NSOPF institutional questionnaire. Rates for new faculty hires may be calculated by institutional type from the IPEDS S, the NSOPF institutional questionnaire, and perhaps the CUPA and Oklahoma surveys. Of these rates, only those taken from the SDR and the IPEDS S allow breakout by gender within ethnicity. The Massy and Goldman (1995) study predicts faculty mobility and new hires based on complex econometric models about undergraduate enrollment (faculty productivity), research expenditures, departmental budgets, and differences by institutional segmentation. It is possible to use the results of rate of growth in faculty positions by each of the ten disciplines which are calculated in the study to project faculty demand."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "It is clear that a massive research effort is underway at the national level to collect data about faculty. These thirteen datasets address many policy issues. Unfortunately, there are problems in using each of them for complex modeling for faculty availability and Ph.D. production studies. Should one of the data elements in the cross-tabs should be eliminated? What is the appropriate level of aggregation? Each level represents a necessary assumption, albeit one of many. This analysis shows that the disciplinary crosswalk must be rolled up to the 29 postsecondary census occupation codes in order to use the SDR. Rank and tenure data are critical to calculating projections for new assistant professor and non-tenure track hires. If the gender or ethnicity variables are discarded, the utility of the model for affirmative action and faculty pipeline research is greatly diminished. Since institutional data are not available across each of the key datasets, the combination of Carnegie classification and control is essential to differentiating segments of institutions. If scholars, researchers, and practitioners agree that the critical cross-tab detailed in this paper is essential to policy analyses about affirmative action and Ph.D. production, then an additional survey instrument should be proposed to NSF and/or NCES. As part of the IPEDS Technical Panel which met in M y, 1997, the author suggested that the IPEDS S survey be expanded to include a table on full-time instructional, research, and service faculty. The table would be broken out by gender within ethnicity by rank within tenure status by discipline clusters. Conceivably, the table could aggregate all disciplines into ten or simply collect data on different disciplines in different years. At ten disciplines a year, over a five year cycle, data could be collected on all 49 CASPAR discipline clusters. Mary Golladay and NSF staff have worked for many years to get interest in a faculty survey at the S&E department level comparable to the GSS. It would be unfortunate, though, if this were limited to only S&E disciplines. .r."}, {"section_title": "The Professional Societies Workshop series sponsored by NSF's Division of Science", "text": "Resources Studies has brought agency and association personnel together in frank discussions of the utility and limitations of these instruments and datasets and the implications for policy research. Several disciplinary associations conduct their own surveys of Ph.D. recipients and-faculty and are perhaps the best prepared to understand discipline-specific tensions of supply and demand. These insights need to be incorporated into the assumptions of these complex models. Several additional research projects are currently underway. According to Ernst Benjamin of AAUP, the Sloan Foundation is funding an effort by Jack H. Schuster of the Claremont Graduate School and others to examine and develop the kind of complex econometric models studied by Massy and Goldman (1995). The Mellon Foundation is funding a Except for the longitudinal study, each of these models shares the limitations of the existing datasets and must by nature make many kinds of assumptions. The Massy and Goldman study, interesting as it is for its explanation of departmental activity in predicting faculty demand, is flawed by its use of the 1980 NRC doctoral rankings data. A model is presented in this paper which uses the best of the national datasets, but it makes many levels of assumptions which are subject to error. No model for understanding faculty availability or supply and demand will be credible unless an effort is made to survey the entire' faculty population at the discipline level. No amount of careful sampling techniques, complex stratification, and weighting methodologies will substitute."}]
