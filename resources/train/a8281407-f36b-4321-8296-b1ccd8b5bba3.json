Conversely, those who are high in neuroticism have been identified as persons high in emotionality, impulsivity, fear, and anger. These individuals are predisposed to negative affect and suffer more acutely from their misfortunes (Costa & McCrae, 1980) . While extraversion and neuroticism have not been specifically related to resiliency attitudes, they have been related to life satisfaction. Satisfaction with life refers to a cognitive, judgmental process that is dependent upon a comparison of one's circumstances to what is thought to be standard (Diener, Emmons, Larsen, & Griffin, 1985) . Its measurement takes into account the fact that each individual places different values on certain elements of what may be considered key elements in life satisfaction, such as health, wealth, and relationships (Diener et al., 1985) . Life satisfaction appears to be a stable personality characteristic, despite transitory effects of life events (Seidlitz, Wyer, & Diener, 1997) . Those individuals who are high in extraversion are more likely to experience positive affect and thus increased life satisfaction. In addition to this, those who are high in neuroticism are more likely to experience negative affect and thus decreased life satisfaction (Costa & McCrae, 1980) .\nResearch on resiliency in coping with trauma has tended to focus on traumatic events of the distant past, often in childhood rather than on current experiences of trauma (King, 2000) . Due to the fact that there has been little research on adults in the process of encountering trauma or those who have encountered trauma only in adulthood, this study sought to examine factors relating to resiliency attitudes in a group of adults experiencing trauma: divorced parents. Marital dissolution is a stressful event for divorcing individuals (Ahrons, 1994) , ranking lower in life trauma only to death of a loved one (King, 2000) . Additionally, there are many social and psychological stressors connected to the process of divorce (Ahrons, 1994) . Research has indicated that separated and divorced individuals are more likely than widowed, never married, and married individuals to be admitted into inpatient and outpatient psychiatric and alcoholism facilities, to be involved in motor vehicle accidents, to commit suicide, and to die from diseases (Frank, 1985) . Thus, it was hypothesized that if there are relationships between resiliency attitudes, life satisfaction, and personality, it would seem that they might be evident in a divorced population.\nThe purpose of this study was to discover if personality, as measured by the Neuroticism-ExtroversionOpenness Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), correlates with resiliency attitudes and the related construct of life satisfaction in divorced parents. The hypotheses for this study were as follows: there would be (a) a positive correlation between extraversion and resiliency, (b) a negative correlation between neuroticism and resiliency, (c) a positive correlation between extraversion and life satisfaction, and (d) a negative correlation between neuroticism and life satisfaction. In addition to extraversion and neuroticism, the NEO-FFI measures openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Thus, connections between these latter three and resiliency attitudes and life satisfaction were also examined."}, {"section_title": "Method Participants", "text": "The 37 participants for this study were from two major cities in a midwestern state. All participants were going through or had been through the process of divorce or separation and were parents of children for whom they were the primary caretakers. The parents were solicited from two parent support groups, employees from a local college, and a group of individuals who were interested in the research. There were no partners from the same couples represented. All participants were above the age of 25."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": "Demographics Questionnaire. The demographics questionnaire was researcher designed for the purposes of this study. The questionnaire consisted of 11 questions and the items had varying response options. Respondents were asked to give their gender, occupation, the number of years since their most recent divorce, and age. Respondents were asked to indicate their level of educational attainment from choices that included: less than a high school diploma, high school diploma, some college, associate degree, technical school, bachelor's degree, graduate degree, and professional school. They also were asked to give the number of years since their most recent divorce, the number of times they have been divorced, the number of children they have, and if they were currently dating. Participants were asked whether they had received additional support from an outside agency other than the support group from which they had been selected. If respondents had received support, they were asked to rate this support on a scale ranging from 1 (very little support) to 5 (very much support). Similarly, respondents were asked to rate the overall level of support (i.e., financial, childcare, and emotional support) they had received from their family in issues relating to the divorce.\nResiliency Attitude Scale. The Resiliency Attitude Scale (RAS, Biscoe & Harris, 1994) measures seven types of resiliency in separate subscales: Insight, Independence, Relationships, Initiative, Creativity and Humor, Morality, and General Resiliency. Due to participant time constraints a shortened, researcher designed, form of the RAS was used for this study versus the original 72-item scale. In its shortened form, the Morality, Initiative, and Independence scales contained one item; the others included two items for a total of 11 items. A Cronbach's Alpha was conducted to determine the reliability of the shortened scale and yielded an alpha of .81, suggesting good internal consistency. Validity information for this shortened measure was not collected. Like the original, each item on the shortened form corresponded to a specific skill or facet of resiliency (e.g., a General Resiliency item was, \"No matter what happens, if I keep trying I'll get through it.\") and these items were answered using the following choices: strongly disagree (1), disagree (2), undecided (3), agree (4), and strongly agree (5). For the subscales containing two items, subscale scores were obtained by summing the items corresponding to that specific subscale, after reverse coding appropriate items. For subscales containing one item, the response to that item constituted the subscale score. A total RAS score was computed by summing all items. On each subscale and the total scale, higher scores indicated higher resiliency attitudes."}, {"section_title": "NEO-FFI.", "text": "Created by Costa and McCrae (1994) , the NEO-FFI is a 60-item version of the NEO-PI-R that provides a brief, comprehensive measure of five domains of personality: Neuroticism (N), Extraversion (E), Openness (O), Agreeableness (A), and Conscientiousness (C). The response scale for each item is as follows: strongly disagree (1), disagree (2), neutral (3), agree (4), and strongly agree (5). Subscale scores are attained by summing the items corresponding to the specific domain of personality after reverse coding appropriate items. Higher scores indicate a greater presence of the personality characteristic in the individual taking the measure. Costa and McCrae (1992) designed the NEO-FFI to measure the same factors as the NEO-PI-R with the same validity. Item selection for the NEO-FFI used the items that most strongly loaded on the five validimax factors from the NEO-PI. When the NEO-FFI was correlated with the domain scales of the NEO-PI-R in the Augmented Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging sample, correlations were .92, .90, .91, .77, and .87 for the N, E, O, A and C domains, respectively (Costa & McCrae, 1992) .\nSatisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). Diener et al. (1985) created the SWLS in an effort to measure global life satisfaction. This scale consists of five statements expressing general life satisfaction (e.g., \"The conditions of my life are excellent\"), and participants rate their agreement with each item on a 7-point scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). These five statements are then summed to obtain an overall life satisfaction score. Diener et al. (1985) indicates that the scale has \"favorable psychometric properties\" (p. 74). For example, correlations between interviewer estimates of well-being and the SWLS were at adequate levels. Diener et al. (1985) also conducted correlations between the SWLS and the other measures of subjective well-being, such as the Fordyce (1978) single item measure of happiness and Cantril's (1965) SelfAnchoring Ladder and the correlations were moderate to strong. Similarly, a correlation of .46 between the SWLS and the Life Satisfaction Index (Adams, 1969) was obtained in a study with older adults."}, {"section_title": "Procedures", "text": "Data were collected from four different groups: Parents without Partners, a church divorce support group, college employees and students, and a group of individuals interested in the research.\nGroup #1. Parents without Partners (PWP) is a not-for-profit agency headed by a group of single parents. The president of PWP granted permission for data collection to take place at one of the group's social activities. At the group activity at which the data were collected, the purpose of the study was explained and an opportunity for questions to be asked and answered was given. Potential participants were made aware that they would be completing three measures and a demographics questionnaire that would take approximately 30 minutes, their name would not be used, and any participation was strictly voluntary.\nA consent form was distributed to those who elected to participate following the verbal description. Participants were asked to read and sign the consent form if they agreed to participate, ten people chose not to participate in the study. The consent forms were collected and those 21 who signed were given packets. Participants were then given instructions on how to complete each of the four measures. This yielded 15 completed sets of measures out of a possible 21 potential participants.\nGroup #2. The same procedure was used for the divorce support group at a local church. Consent was obtained from the pastor of the church. Participants were solicited at their weekly meeting. Nine completed sets of measures were collected from this group.\nGroup #3 and Group #4. Employees at a local college and a group of interested individuals also were asked to participate in this study via e-mail. Individuals who were interested in participating responded to an e-mail that was sent to ask for volunteers. Those who volunteered to take part in the study met with the researcher individually to get the consent forms and questionnaires.

Occupations were varied; some positions mentioned by respondents were registered nurse, machinist, and health information technologist. This varying range of occupations can be best understood in the context of the educational backgrounds that were reported: seven (19.4%) reported a high school diploma, seven (19.4%) some college, six (16.7%) associate degree, six (16.7%) technical school degree, five (13.9%) bachelor's degree, four (11.1%) graduate or professional school, and one (2.8%) did not report his/her educational status.\nNearly all individuals in this study were experiencing their first divorce; only one reported experiencing his/her second. Fifty percent of the respondents reported dating.

Because external support has been shown to relate to resiliency (Barnard, 1994; Garvin et al., 1993) , it was thought that the reason for the lack of NEO-FFI-RAS and NEO-FFI-SWLS relationships might be due in part to variability in social support. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to examine relationships between extraversion and neuroticism and facets of the subscales of the RAS. The facets of the subscales represent individual items under a subscale. These facets target specific skills related to each type of resiliency identified by the RAS. A positive correlation was found between the personality characteristic of neuroticism and the RAS facet of finding new ways to look at things from the subscale of Creativity, r (34) = .33, p < .05. This indicates that those higher in neuroticism tend to find new ways of looking at things in their lives. In addition to this, a negative relationship between extraversion and a facet of the Relationship Resiliency subscale,the tendency to avoid repeating unhealthy relationships, was found, r (34) = -.33, p < .05. This indicates that those lower in extraversion also tend to avoid repeating unhealthy relationships.\nRecall that divorced individuals were chosen as the population which to study resiliency because divorce is traumatic enough that factors relevant to resiliency should show up in that population. However, because it seemed likely that those divorced for a shorter length of time would be experiencing trauma to a greater degree than those divorced for a longer length of time, it seemed important to compare the resiliency scores of the two groups. Thus, an independent samples t test was conducted to compare the RAS scores of individuals who were divorced for a length of time at/below the mean number of years (7.5 years) to those who were divorced for a length of time above the mean. No significant difference was found, t(34) = -.815, p > .05. The mean RAS score of those divorced for 7.5 years or less (M = 42.00, SD = 6.13) was not significantly different from those who were divorced more than 7.5 years (M = 43.77, SD = 6.48)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "While past research has indicated that personality does have an impact on the behaviors and attitudes people exhibit (Barnard, 1994 , D'Imperio et al., 2000 , & Garvin et al., 1993 , this is one of the few studies focusing on connections between the specific variables of personality and resiliency attitudes. Additionally, this study represented an attempt to extend the earlier qualitative literature on resiliency (Barnard, 1994 , Goertzel & Goertzel, 1962 , by searching for quantitative indication for factors important in coping with trauma using the NEO-FFI and RAS.\nIt was predicted that extraversion on the NEO-FFI would positively correlate with resiliency attitudes on the RAS, and that neuroticism would negatively correlate with resiliency attitudes. However, the total Resiliency Attitude Scale (RAS) scores and extraversion scores on the NEO-FFI were not significantly correlated, nor were the total RAS scores and neuroticism scores. Second, it was hypothesized that higher scores on extraversion and lower scores on neuroticism would predict greater life satisfaction. However, persons who were more extraverted and lower in neuroticism did not tend to be more satisfied with life.\nDespite this, there were correlations found between specific items of the RAS and the NEO-FFI. Specifically, there was a positive correlation between new ways of looking at things from the Creativity subscale and neuroticism. While it seems counterintuitive that individuals who score higher in neuroticism also would show greater resiliency according to the creativity item, a validity study comparing client and non-client groups indicated a similar pattern. Specifically, the client group, who likely is higher in neuroticism, scored lower on all resiliency attitude subscales than did the non-client group, with the exception of the Creativity subscale (Biscoe & Harris, 1994) . This provides an indication of the validity of the direction of the neuroticism-creativity finding in this research.\nIn addition to the above correlation, surprisingly, a negative correlation was found between extraversion and the tendency to avoid unhealthy relationships from the Relationships subscale. Extraversion has been found to be associated with psychological and social adjustment (Costa & McCrae, 1980) , which is why it was hypothesized that those scoring higher in extraver-sion would score higher on the RAS. However, the negative correlation may have been due to the possibility that because those high in extraversion seek out more relationships than do those lower in extraversion (Costa & McCrae, 1992) , they tend to find a combination of both healthy relationships and unhealthy ones. That is, those high in extraversion do not seek unhealthy relationships nor do they avoid them.\nPerhaps one of the more interesting findings was that the point in the divorce process did not relate to resiliency attitudes. The comparison between individuals who were divorced for 7.5 years or less (below the mean) and those divorced more than 7.5 years was made because it was possible that correlations between personality and resiliency attitudes may have been more easily detected a shorter time after the divorce. This is because those who have to recall back to the time of their divorce may not recall the exact attitudes they had then; rather their memories can be confounded by the attitudes that they have now, which may be more positive for the longer divorced group. Additionally, longer-divorced individuals may have achieved stability in their lives. However, an independent samples t test suggested that the varying points at which the individuals were in the divorce process may not have related to their resiliency attitudes.\nWhile it is possible that personality does not relate to resiliency attitudes, the general lack of relationships between neuroticism, extraversion, and Resiliency Attitude Scale scores may have been due to small sample size. Similarly, small sample size probably was responsible for the finding of a lack of relationship between extraversion and life satisfaction, as past research has shown that extraversion relates to happiness (Costa & McCrae, 1980) . Another area of concern for this study was the validity of the shortened RAS scale. While validity has been determined for the original 72-item version of the RAS, the shortened version has not been tested for validity. With fewer items for participants to respond to, there was a smaller opportunity for variability among the participants' answers. Without variability, a true relationship between the desired variables may have been hidden.\nOne limitation of the present study was that the population consisted of divorced single parents, a specific population at a specific point in their lives, going through a specific sort of trauma. This may highly reduce the generalizability of this study. A second limitation was the variability of the participants in terms of support. An attempt was made to partial out the degree of support out of personality and RAS, and satisfaction with life and RAS, with the variables remaining uncorrelated. Despite this, the importance of external support remains. Past research has indicated that external factors bear much weight in an individual's ability to be resilient (Barnard, 1994; Garvin et al., 1993) . It is possible that a more specific measure of support versus the global one used in the current study may be helpful in tapping into the role that external support plays in resiliency attitudes.\nTo correct these limitations, future research should be done with a much larger sample of divorced parents. Additionally, future research with personality and resiliency might measure resiliency differently. Perhaps the hypothesized correlations would have been found between personality and resiliency if resiliency behavior, rather than resiliency attitudes, had been measured or if the longer version of the RAS had been used.\nFurther research in this area remains important despite the lack of significant findings in this study as the study's limitations may be at fault for the lack of correlations between personality and resiliency. Nonetheless, if there are significant findings in future research it may have implications for the way divorced individuals are taught to cope in marriage and family therapy, assuming that personality affects coping behaviors. For example, therapists might help divorced individuals bring out the personality characteristics that have that have been found to be key in resiliency, or at least learn the skills that those high in resiliency demonstrate. Thus, these individuals may be able to cope better and become more resilient in the face of trauma."}]
