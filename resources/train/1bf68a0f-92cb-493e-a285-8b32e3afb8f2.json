[{"section_title": "", "text": "Environmental regulation of farms and ranches in the U.S. is often portrayed as one of two extremes. Sometimes farms and ranches are described as severely over-regulated (Duvall 2018). Other times, these same farms and ranches are described as being almost entirely unregulated (Ruhl 2000). One reason behind these diverging opinions is the extremely wide range of areas and approaches to regulating agriculture (Stubbs 2014). Agricultural environmental regulation can cover a wide range of domains such as water pollution, air pollution, wildlife, and wetlands. Often regulations are implemented at different levels of government: local, state, or national. There are several possible policy mechanisms to address the negative environmental outcomes associated with agricultural production. USDA has promoted environmental stewardship through voluntary conservation programs that provide technical and financial assistance to farmers and ranchers willing to adopt more sustainable or less harmful production practices. Nonetheless, in some instances policies makers at different levels have used regulation to require specific practices. The impacts, or costs, of these regulations on agricultural producers have received only limited analysis in the literature on the economics of environmental regulation. In part, the limited research is due to the large variation in regulatory approaches, the levels of government at which they are implemented, and the types of farms to which they apply. Federal regulations are often delegated to states to implement, resulting in variation across the sector that can be challenging to analyze. If environmental regulation of the agricultural sector, then we would expect that these regulations impose meaningful cost, analysis of which is critical for determining whether the benefits of regulation are sufficient to justify a regulatory approach. For example, environmental regulation is estimated to be responsible for costs equivalent to about two percent of GDP (Pizer and Kopp, 2003). Focusing on only the air quality component of that regulation under the Clean Air Act, studies find that the full set of laws may have benefits as much as 42 times the costs (Krupnick and Morgenstern, 2002) while specific amendments to the act might not pass a benefit cost test (Portney, 1990) Several studies have examined the relationship between specific environmental regulations and agricultural costs or profits. Njuki and Bravo-Ureta (2015) examine a hypothetical greenhouse gas regulation and find that dairy producers in the Midwest and Northeast are likely to face significantly higher regulatory costs compared to other regions of the country. However, they indicate that as the industry consolidates those costs are likely to be driven down due to economies of scale, as discussed in McDonald, McBride, and O'Donoghue (2007). In contrast, Sneeringer and Key (2011) find that operations may scale-down operations to avoid regulation in which operation size can trigger exposure to regulation. In a study of livestock operations, these authors use data on the size of hog operations from the Census of Agriculture in 1997Agriculture in , 2002Agriculture in , and 2007 -before and after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency implemented regulations on animal manure pollution. They find a significant number of operations are just below the size threshold that would trigger regulation. In another study of spatial variation related to regulation Herath, et al (2005) find livestock production is spatially distributed in a way that suggests regulatory avoidance. Producers are moving to locations likely to have less stringent regulations. One of the most prominent federal environmental regulations of agriculture in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFO) regulation of water quality related to livestock operations, which as estimated to cost up to $326 million annually. Centner and Mullen (2004) discuss ways to reduce the regulatory burden and costs by targeting the rule to locations where impaired waters are problematic, thereby allowing areas with fewer concerns to avoid costly regulations. There can also be ambiguity about regulation -some programs are voluntary; some rules only apply to operations of a certain size -and farmers may be unsure about whether their operations are subject to regulations. In other domains, regulatory uncertainty has been shown to impact firms' costs by changing optimal investment strategies (Teisberg 1993). This suggests that regulation has the potential to impose costs even on farms who think they might be regulated if those farms take any sort of costly action in response to that uncertainty. Some of the uncertainty might simply reflect the fact that regulations often proceed through complicated stages of implementation or that regulations may be unevenly enforced. As noted above, incentive programs, often referred to as financial assistance in the context of farm policy, can be an alternative regulation. Often these conservation programs, particularly USDA's Environmental Quality Incentives Program, are described as payments for ecosystem services. However, these programs also serve partially as a form of regulatory relief through which taxpayers directly offset a portion of regulatory compliance costs (Claassen et al. 2008). This role of the program is explicit in the enabling legislation, shown in the appendix to this paper. The purpose of this paper is to better understand producer perceptions of regulatory burden at the state/local and federal levels and across environmental domains, and how the perceptions interact with profit across farms. The current version of this paper uses a basic measure of regulatory exposure and pools all types of farms together. The preliminary estimates are indicative of the basic relationship between regulation and farm financial outcomes. Future work will refine these estimates by focusing on subsets of farm operations and specific types of regulations."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The data for this study come from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS), which is developed by the USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) and administered by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). In 2015, ERS incorporated questions about environmental regulations into the Phase 3 Commodity Cost and Returns version of the survey, which is an operation-level survey designed to provide a nationally representative summary of farm production and finances. Additional details on the survey methodology are available from ERS and NASS at the webpage links provided in the appendix. Survey respondents, typically the primary farm operators, were asked to report their exposure to environmental regulation in nine different environmental areas: water quality, manure management, air quality, wildlife, water quantity, wetlands, soil (including erosion), land use, and any other area not covered by the previous eight areas. (See the appendix for an image of the survey question.) Although the survey did not ask for details about specific regulations, many of the well-known regulations would fall under clear categories. Regulations such as Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) rules under the Clean Water Act would likely be reported under water quality, while conservation compliance rules would likely be reported under erosion control. For each area, the respondents were asked separately about exposure to \"local or state\" and \"federal\" regulation. To allow for uncertainty about regulatory exposure, respondents could answer \"yes,\" \"no,\" or \"don't know\" for each of the eighteen questions. They were also asked whether, for each area, they received financial assistance through USDA working lands conservation programs as part of compliance. The final sample for this study consists of 13,986 observations (table 1). From the full set of data, that sample excludes 1,821 records of respondents who skipped the entire set of questions about regulations and 1,330 records of respondent who answered \"don't know\" on all 18 questions. The decision to exclude these two sets of responses means that the reported statistics implicitly assume that full non-responders and fully uncertain responders are, on average, the same as the 13,986. Among the sample observations, there are 4,889 farm operations that report being regulated in at least one 18 possible categories and 9,097 farm operations that report being unregulated in all 18 of the questions (table 1). The unweighted average regulated farm is larger -18 percent more operated acres, 52 percent higher revenue per acre, 31 percent higher profit per acre, and 30 percent higher land value per acre -compared to the unweighted average unregulated farm. However, there is also considerable variation around these averages. Notably, the average survey weight on regulated farms is about 45 percent lower since larger operations are oversampled in ARMS. The average operator age is similar across operations. Farms of respondents who skipped the entire table are on average smaller than the unregulated farms. For those respondents who answered with \"don't know\" on all 18 questions, average acreage and land values fall been regulated and unregulated farms, but average revenue and profit are much lower that all three other groups."}, {"section_title": "Exposure to Regulation", "text": "About 23 percent of all farms are exposed to at least one of the nine areas of environmental regulation asked about in this study (table 2). Since the regulated farms tend to be larger and have higher revenue, total exposure to these regulations represents as much as 34 percent of acres operated and 33 percent of farm revenue. While overall exposure to regulation is between one-fourth and one-third of farming, no individual category of regulation covers more than one-tenth of operations or one-fifth of acres operated (table 2). Regulations related to soils, including those pertaining to erosion, are the most common and influence about 9 percent of farm operations and as much as 18 percent of acres operated. Regulations related to water quality, water quantity, and land use are also among the more common. The environmental areas with lowest extent of regulation are air quality, wildlife and the \"other\" category. In between these two groups, regulations related to manure and wetlands have more moderate extent. Exposure to regulation varies considerably by type of agricultural production and by the level at which regulations are implemented (table 3). Dairy and poultry producers are the most likely to be regulated. Vegetable, nursery, and beef operations are the least likely to be regulated. Regulation at only the state/local level is somewhat more common than federal and state/local levels combined and much more common than regulation at only the federal level. Some of this may reflect the fact that some federal regulations are implemented by the states. The similar pattern holds for regulations by area rather than by type of organization (appendix table A2). The extent of regulation also varies by state (figure 1). At the high end, about 50 percent of farms in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern states and 40 percent of farms in California are subject to at least one area of environmental regulation. At the low end, between 10 and 16 percent of farms in Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Georgia, and New York, are subject to at least one area of environmental regulation. Perhaps surprisingly, given the earlier finding that stateonly regulation is more common, there is a very strong correlation between exposure to state and exposure to federal environmental regulations. States with higher state/local regulatory exposure also have higher federal regulatory exposure."}, {"section_title": "Conservation programs", "text": "For this study, the survey asks farm operations whether they have ever received financial assistance from USDA's two largest working lands conservation programs, the Environmental non-USDA programs, these are by far the most common sources for both type of assistance. In addition, for each area of environmental regulation, the survey asks whether the farm operation is receiving financial assistance from EQIP or CSP in the survey year for the explicit purpose of assisting with compliance for that area regulation. Among those farm operations that report no exposure to any of the nine categories of environmental regulation, less than 10 percent have ever received financial assistance from EQIP or CSP (figure 2). Slightly more than 10 percent of these unregulated operations have ever received financial assistance from NRCS. This small difference is consistent with the fact that farmers and ranchers can receive technical assistance without receiving financial assistance. Regulated farm operations, which are those with exposure to at least one of the nine areas of regulation in the survey, are about three to four times as likely to have ever participated in financial or technical assistance. The participation rate in EQIP or CSP is about 20 percent for farms facing only state regulation and about 30 percent for farms facing either state and federal or only federal regulations. The participation rate in NRCS technical assistance is about 25 percent for farms facing only state regulation and about 40 percent for farms facing either state and federal or only federal regulations."}, {"section_title": "Economic effects of environmental regulation", "text": "Environmental regulations are expected to increase farm costs. As shown in the summary statistics regulated farms have average per acre costs of $3,908 per acre, which is 61 percent more than the $2,462 average per acre costs for unregulated farms (table 1). While such differences are suggestive, there are many reasons that the costs of the two different will be, on average, different. As noted above, one important reason in that some regulations apply to larger operations. To estimate a causal effect of regulation on regulated farms requires a statistical method to select a more appropriate subset of unregulated farms to construct a counter factual. In this study, we use a propensity score matching model to estimate the effect of environmental regulation on regulated farms. The treatment variable is exposure to at least one variation. Selection variables are total acres operated, county population in the 2010 census, indicator variables for type of operation (as shown in table 3), and indicator variables for state. The model is applied to fix different outcome variables: total cost per acre, fixed cost per acre, variable cost per acre, revenue per acre, and net agricultural income per acre. The cost and revenue variable, which are all strictly positive, are logged so that treatment effects report expected percentage changes in the outcomes due to exposure to at least regulation. Net income, which can be negative for operations that experiences a financial loss in the survey year, is not logged, so the treatment effects report expected change in dollars per acre profit (table 4). For the basic model presented here, the average treatment effect of exposure to at least one environmental regulation at either the federal, state or local level is an expected 23 percent increase in total costs. The effect on variable costs (32 percent) is larger than the effect on fixed costs (16 percent). The effects of exposure to federal regulation (either alone or in combination with state or local) is smaller (11 percent) than the effects of exposure to state or local regulation (28 percent; either alone or in combination with federal). In addition to the expected increase in costs, environmental regulations are associated with an increase in farm revenue. The expected gain in per-acre farm revenue is 20 percent for exposure to regulation at any level, 16 percent for federal regulation, and 25 percent for state or local regulation. The effect of regulatory exposure on net income represents the combined effect of the changes in both costs and revenue. For all levels of regulation, the expect change in per-acre net income is not statistically different from zero. There are at least three possible interpretations of these preliminary results. If the identification assumptions underlying the matching model are correct and these results are robust to alternative specifications, then environmental regulations impose large costs on those farms facing regulations. Since 23 percent of farms representing 33 percent of farm revenue are subject to at least one regulation (table 2), a 23 percent increase in per-acre costs for those farms would represent, very roughly, a single digit percentage point increase in industrylevel costs of compliance, which is comparable to although perhaps slightly higher than estimates for other industries. Notably, most of the expected increase in costs is in turn captured though higher revenue, so the net effects are profit are negligible. This suggest that incidence of regulation is passed along the supply chain, likely eventually reaching consumers. The higher costs and higher revenue could also be associated with the possibility that regulations create barriers to entry, a result that has been found in other industries. This interpretation is not mutually exclusive with the previous interpretation, but it implies that the mechanism of increase costs and revenue is at least partially indirect. It is also possible, even likely, that the underlying identifications are not valid. By pooling all operations and states into a single model, using regulation type as only a selection variable, the model does not adequately control for other unobserved difference between regulated farms and the selected subset of unregulated (but equally likely to be regulated) farms. Future analysis of these data will refine the model to examine this possibility and evaluate the underlying identification assumptions."}, {"section_title": "Future Work", "text": "Future research will improve these preliminary estimates in four ways. First, additional data will be gathered to improve the propensity score estimation. These data will primarily involve data on biophysical outcomes that often drive regulation, which includes stream and water body quality as reflected in the EPA's 303d database and soil erodibility as captured in USDAs soil databases. These data may also involve other ARMS variables that reflect the types of operations characteristics that drive selection into or out of certain environmental regulations, which include factors such as direct payment and crop insurance participation. Second, the model will be estimated separately for different types of operations, which will ensure that, for example, per-acre economic outcomes for crop farms are not part of the control group for estimating treatment effects of regulation on, for example, beef operations. Third, alternative definitions of the \"treatment\" of regulation will be expanded and testing, including differentiated between operations that receive financial assistance related to compliance and those that do not. Fourth, once the additional data collection is completed and alternative model specifications are chosen, the analysis will include standard tests for balance between matched observations and robustness checks."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Using a nationally representative dataset of farm operations with information on selfreported exposure to environmental regulation, this study evaluates the extent and costs of environmental regulation of farms across nine different types of regulations. While most farms are not regulated in any area and most areas have fairly limited scope, the cumulative exposure across all areas is notable. About 23 percent of operations, representing about one-third of farm revenue, are subject to regulation in at least one area. For these regulated operations, the expected increase in per-acre costs is large, but it nearly offset by comparable increases in peracre revenue. These results may partially explain the conflicting ways that regulation about farms is presented in policy debates. When looking at total regulatory exposure, most operations, acres, and revenue are not subject to regulation. However, those operations that are subject to regulation face potentially large increases in costs. While this research uses broad measures of regulatory exposure that are likely too coarse to inform policy analysis of individual regulations, the general findings indicate environmental regulation of agricultural production is an important driver of economics and market outcomes.
