[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 , caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to spread rapidly across the globe (Wu et al, 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 is a +ssRNA virus that belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus within the Coronaviridae family, which also includes SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. As of May 2020, at the time of writing, there have been over 5 million confirmed cases globally. Over one third of the global cases are in the United States of America with the U. S. death toll exceeding 95,000.\nSince the emergence of widely available genomic sequencing, rigorous genomic surveillance and contact tracing (Gire et al., 2014) , coupled with extensive testing have come to play critical roles in understanding disease transmission routes, inferring outbreak points, and taking informed measures in containing infections.\nThe Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) launched the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 on March 13 th , a SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing research assay on March 26, and an Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibody IgG test on April 10 th , 2020. Testing was conducted on a broad population including patients at CHLA and other institutions within the Los Angeles metropolitan area. To better understand the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic globally, nationally, and locally, we sought to develop the necessary bioinformatics tools and resources to help guide effective infection control and prevention strategies at our hospital and across Los Angeles County.\nThere are multiple SARS-CoV-2 data repositories. GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/; Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017; Shu et al., 2017) is the major repository for rapid sharing of COVID-19 data across the globe. GISAID stores SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and associated clinical, geographical, and epidemiological data. The NCBI Virus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/) and the China National Center for Bioinformation 2019 nCoV Resource (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/; Zhao et al., 2020) are other major resources. Across these repositories, however, meta-data and naming conventions are not standardized nor are the data consolidated. To overcome this limitation, the CHLA Center for Personalized Medicine (CPM) created the COVID-19 Analysis Research Database (CARD), and has been continuously collecting, consolidating and curating full-length SARS-CoV-2 data from across the world.\nWhile there is a significant lack of COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 genomic resources and bioinformatics tools in general, NextStrain is an outstanding exception (https://nextstrain.org/ncov; Hadfield J et al 2018) . It serves as a great resource for understanding how the COVID-19 pandemic has been spreading globally. NexStrain tools are visually appealing and highly interactive.\nHowever, despite its critical role in the epidemiological studies of COVID-19, it lacks the functionality for analyzing user-supplied data nor does it allow for sophisticated interactive tree manipulation required by scientists for in-depth interrogation of likely infection patterns. Therefore, to complement NextStrain and to serve the advanced needs of scientists, we developed a highly interactive phylogenetic analysis platform. The platform allows for flexible tree operations, interactive displays of much larger trees stratified by various types of metadata, and importantly, provides for interrogation of likely origins of user submitted genome sequences, which are useful in genomic surveillance.\nThe key to rapid genomic surveillance of a particular genome sequence is to precisely place it within the geographically complete and temporally up-to-date phylogenetic contexts. Combined with accurate clinical records and patient contact history, this would aid in identifying the likely source of infection. For this reason, and assuming the viral sequence can be reliably determined using a next-generation sequencing method of choice by the users, we focused on genome comparison, variant calling, variant annotation, and variant profiling against the global virus isolate collection in order to identify the identical, more ancestral, or likely descendent isolates in order to reveal the potential route of transmission. CHLA CARD can provide such an analysis, taking only a few seconds per genome, to generate and return results dynamically embedded in global, USA, and local phylogenetic trees that can be visualized and manipulated through the web interface."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "System Design and Modules. Our ultimate goal is to develop a centralized genomic resource to provide SARS-CoV-2 full-length viral sequencing data analysis and reporting functions for both internal and external needs. To accomplish these goals, we needed to a) assemble a comprehensive genomic database of full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences collected from COVID-19 samples worldwide; b) pre-compute baseline phylogenetic trees of published highquality SARS-CoV-2 sequences globally, nationally, and locally; c) build a Web Portal for interactive querying of SARS-CoV-2 sequences and associated meta-data; d) implement online bioinformatics tools for interactive phylogenetic analysis and visualization; e) develop a suite of bioinformatics tools for SARS-CoV-2 genome comparison, variant calling and functional annotation; f) devise phylogenetic analysis tools to infer transmission patterns and to determine the origins of infections; and g) establish an Application Programming Interface (API) that allows programmatic access to results in JSON format, such that this resource can be integrated into other SARS-CoV-2 analytical pipelines seamlessly. These represent components of our overall system design goal and constitute the modules of CHLA CARD."}, {"section_title": "Data Preparation.", "text": "The CHLA internal SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data were generated using the SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing research assay, established by the CHLA Center for Personalized Medicine and the Virology Laboratory (Pandey et al., in preparation) . The major external resources of SARS-CoV-2 strains, genome sequences, and variants were GISAID, GenBank, CNCB, and NextStrain. Data were downloaded in various formats depending on the exact implementations of these external resources. The retrieved data were post-processed, merged, reformatted, and loaded into a MySQL database. Within this database, a master table is created to store merged and normalized viral meta-data from these resources based upon a template that is compatible with NextStrain's meta-data table. This master table is continuously updated to ensure CHLA CARD provides the most up-to-date and comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 data to end users. The viral genome sequences and metadata are cross-examined to identify and to remove duplicate entries present in multiple resources. Variant calls were generated either internally based on the genome sequences or downloaded directly from China National Center or Bioinformation (CNCB), and were formatted by incorporating standard conventions, functional annotations, and virus information.\nThus, the compiled reference database consists of a comprehensive set of full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, their variants relative to the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence (NC_045512.2), strains, and associated meta-data. Currently (as of 05/20/2020), CHLA CARD contains data from 30,000 SARS-CoV-2 strains, over 30,000 complete genome sequences, and more than 7,000 variants.\nStatistical and categorical analyses of these reported isolates and variants reveal some notable differences between the United States (USA) and non-USA isolates across genes, and for different annotation classes (Figure 1 , Table S1 ). For missense variants, the number is highest in orf1ab polyprotein, 1,191 variants were seen at least three times in 21,535 Non-USA isolates and 589 variants in 5,915 USA isolates. This is expected because this is a large gene (21,290 base pairs or 71.1% of the virus genome) (Figure 1) . The shorter surface glycoprotein S gene which is only 3,822 base pairs in length, contains about 1/5 of the missense variants or 252 for non-US and 106 for USA isolates, at a similar variant density as orf1ab. It is noteworthy that envelope protein gene orf3a's in-frame deletions and frameshift deletions are only identified in isolates from USA (12), Australia (6), UK (5), China (5) and Spain (2) but not in other countries. There are recurrent deletions around base positions 26157-26161, including 7 frameshift deletions and 4 disruptive and 5 conservative inframe deletions; from both USA and non-USA isolates. The mutation and haplotype analysis using CHLA CARD revealed multiple interesting observations already. The missense mutation frequencies are significantly higher than that of synonymous mutations in the same genes. For example, the numbers are 178 vs 81 (2.2x) in N gene, and 252 vs 144 (1.75x) in S gene for the non-USA isolates (Figure 1) . Comprehensive haplotype profiling identified wide-spread country-and state-specific haplotypes which together involved about 29.2% of US isolates, which points to the effectiveness of existing travel restriction policies and public health measures in controlling the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (Shen et al., in submission). Phylogenetic Analysis and Reference Phylogenetic Trees. Viral genome sequences are quality benchmarked by counting the missing bases, the length deviation from the reference sequence (NC_045512.2), and the quality scores (if available). When constructing different subsets of global or country-specific FASTA datasets, the demographic meta-data is used as an inclusion filter for the proper sequences. The reference sequence (NC_045512.2) is always included, and MN996532 (bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013) coronavirus sequence is included to serve as the outgroup to root the phylogenetic tree. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was conducted with MAFFT version 7.460 (Katoh et al, 2002; Katoh and Toh, 2008) using speed-oriented method FFT-NS-i (iterative refinement method, two cycles) optimized for large datasets. The resulting MSA files were visually examined. All alignments with gaps over 3 bases, or smaller gaps that resulted from inserted \"N\" (missing) bases, are removed. The 5'-and 3'-end bases are trimmed because they are often of lower quality. The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method and General Time Reversible model (Nei and Kumar, 2000) in MEGA X (Kumar et al., 2018) . Initial trees for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Joining and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the Maximum Composite Likelihood (MCL) approach, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. All positions with over 2% alignment gaps, missing data, and ambiguous bases were excluded. The trees with maximum likelihood were kept as the reference trees for visualization at the web portal. These trees are periodically updated as new genome sequence data are acquired."}, {"section_title": "Virus Genome Tracker by Genome Comparison and SNP Profiling against Global Virus", "text": "Collection. The CHLA CARD Virus Genome Tracker provides: 1) quick comparison of FASTA sequences from complete or partial viral genomes to the reference NC_045512.2 genome for assessing coverage, detecting potential large-scale genome rearrangement, and calling variants; 2) annotation of functional consequence and allele frequency of global virus isolates in order to identify novel and recurrent variants, as well potential candidate variants of 6 ot ity ce of on nd he ith od ng at ed he in lly ed gy nd ce e us of .2 nd us of clinical significance; 3) identification of strains of identical or similar variant profiles (haplotype) across the country or world, or strains with additional private variant(s) thus likely descendants in the evolutionary tree, or strains with fewer variants but similar haplotype thus likely ancestral in the evolutionary tree. These findings, along with the geographic location, the collection date, and the patient contact history may aid in the tracing of transmission route. The employed strategy is genome comparison followed by SNP profiling, where the query can be the viral sequence in FASTA format, variants in VCF format, or just a free-style list.\nThe global SARS-CoV-2 isolate collection is matched by shared variant profile of input data. The matched isolates are ranked and classified into 3 match levels: 1) Level 1 matches have identical (Match ratio =1.0), or minimal private variants (Match ratio <1.0) compared with the input isolate and thus could be identical haplotype, 2) Level 2 matches have more additional private variants than Level 1 thus maybe the descendants, and 3) Level 3 matches have fewer variants, and thus may be more ancestral. The Level 1 and 2 top-match isolates are visualized and automatically highlighted on the pre-built reference phylogenetic trees of either Global or USA-specific isolates. "}, {"section_title": "A Case Study -Phylodynamic Analysis Identifies a Potential Outbreak Point in Los", "text": "Angeles. The CHLA CPM sequenced 31 viral isolates with its SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing research assay (Pandey et al., in preparation) . We analyzed the complete genomes of these isolates by two strategies: 1) Virus Genome Tracker which placed these 31 genomes into the global isolate context in a few minutes, and 2) a refining strategy that merged them onto the reference USA phylogenetic tree, see Figure 2 . The Virus Genome Tracker strategy using the consensus sequences correctly picked similar external isolates for refined phylogenetic analysis: identical-variant/Level 1 matches (EPI_ISL_415543 & EPI_ISL_415544; Figure 2) , and descendent/Level 2 match (EPI_ISL_424890 & MT325610). Merging these results onto the reference USA phylogenetic tree we could demonstrate that there is a branching point where 13 of 31 cases center around and make up 9 out of 13 branches from this point. This point is in the middle of the transmission route, inferred from traversing the phylogenetic tree, below a large number of Washington State samples. Among these cases were three members from the same household. This provides a real case example as to how the Virus Genome Tracker and the CHLA CARD facilitated the identification of similar isolates, which can serve as the proxy to query isolates and to place them onto the prebuilt phylogenetic trees in just a few minutes. Customized URLs to the reference trees are automatically generated by Virus Genome Tracker for visualization and exploration.

This genomic resource enables and empowers genomic epidemiology studies to understand the origin and spread of SARS-CoV-2 globally, nationally and locally. It also provides in-depth understanding of how the viral genome evolves as the disease spreads across the globe.\nThe Virus Genome Tracker utilizes MUMmer for super-fast genome alignment and comparison which, combined with the MySQL database backend, can return results within a few seconds (~5 sec) from a search against over 30,000 virus isolates. It supports both whole genome and partial genome sequences, and is thus suitable for handling the consensus sequence data derived from various sequencing strategies. Furthermore, we integrated the genomic variants with gene annotations and population-level data using the smooth scrolling and zooming capability of JBrowse genome browsing for user-friendly browsing and exploration. To our knowledge, there are no published online tools suitable for rapid typing of new SARS-CoV-2 virus isolates, that provide similar functionalities as CHLA CARD, which is empowered by rich viral sequences, isolates, geographic information and phylogenetic data. The Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool (Cleemput et al., 2020) is capable of online sequence but not variant analysis, and has very limited SARS-CoV-2 data with no interactive phylogenetic analysis and visualization.\nTogether, this genomic resource provides users access to the COVID-19 bioinformatics tools and a comprehensive database of viral genome sequences, including multiple sequence alignments, variants with functional annotations and population frequencies, and precomputed phylogenetic trees, all accessible through the website and the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome browser. Our pilot study using internal cases demonstrates our capability for generating the genomic epidemiology data required to aid in the development of clinical policies and decision making such as devising quarantine and containment strategies.\nModifications to the algorithm and visualization tools employed for virus transmission inference and tracing are in progress to incorporate spatial-temporal-travel data. A mobile version of the web portal is on the roadmap for interactive exploration of data on-the-go. API and beacon capabilities are being implemented to facilitate computational biologists with accessing our standardized viral data.\nNational Center for Bioinformation (CNCB), Nextstrain and other sources.
