[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background and Purpose"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Structural imaging has had a long role as biomarker of progression among entry criteria for AD trials [1] . The advent of disease-modifying therapies has led to interest in the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a possible \"surrogate\" measure of outcome. The two most established markers of progression on MRI are the hippocampal and the whole brain atrophy rates [2] . However, the first study assessing the effects of \u03b2-amyloid immunotherapy reported surprising findings, i.e. greater hippocampal and whole-brain atrophy rates in patients treated with AN1792 vaccination [3] . On the contrary, cortical thickness might be a promising \"global\" measure of disease progression, as it could represent a marker more specifically related to the evolution of AD evolution [4, 5] and might be useful to evaluate the efficacy of new diseasemodifying therapies [6] .\nSeveral tools for the automatic extraction of cortical thickness have been developed, each based on different levels of complexity, robustness, and automation. Among others, the Civet-CLASP pipeline [7] and Freesurfer [8] are the two most exploited algorithms within the neuroscientific community. Obtaining an accurate thickness measurement requires the explicit reconstruction of the outer boundary on the base of the inner boundary [9] , which can be done along two different approaches: (I) a skeleton method or (II) a model-based deformation of the inner surface. CIVET makes use of the skeleton mesh-based approach called constrained Laplacian anatomic segmentation using proximity. The pial surface is expanded from the white surface up to the boundary between gray matter and CSF, along a Laplacian map [10] . Terms for stretch and self-proximity are included to regularize the deforming mesh and avoid mesh self-intersection inside sulci. Differently, Freesurfer makes use of iterative and adaptive deformation and segmentation methods, deforming the mesh to reconstruct the inner and the pial surfaces. Freesurfer uses a routine function to find and correct the topological defects in the initial inner surface. The deformable model is constrained by a second-order smoothing term [11] and by a mesh self-intersection prevention routine [8] , which both help to correctly establish the boundaries between adjacent banks in tight sulci. Unfortunately, some relevant problems hamper the use of these techniques. Both tools measure the cortical thickness from two 3D cortical sheets, each of which is composed by thousands of vertices and faces, making the reconstruction of the cortical mantle a complex and time consuming procedure [12] .\nAlthough several methods have been proposed in the past decades, little work has been done to compare their performances on real clinical datasets [13] . The aim of this study was to perform a head-to-head comparison between Civet-CLASP and Freesurfer. This can be considered a mandatory step toward the standardization of cortical thickness biomarkers, which in turn will pave the way to effectively translate a three-dimensional cortical marker to innovative disease modifying trials."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods Subjects", "text": "The sample group we selected consisted of 185 subjects (69 normal elderly controls (CTR), 37 stable MCI (sMCI), 27 progressive MCI (pMCI), and 52 Alzheimer (AD) patients), belonging to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI1).

For an accurate comparison to be possible, it was necessary to deform the surface morphology of at least one algorithm. To map each point of one surface onto the other, we adopted an elastic non-rigid registration to get the right displacement vector. To our knowledge, Gradient Vector Flow (GVF) has not been used before to control 3D free form deformation. The vector field computed via GVF provided the directions along which each vertex of our source surface could evolve to match a corresponding point on the target surface. Once registered, space coordinates of each face vertices are coincident and vertices are spatially aligned. Subsequently, in order to compare the correct cortical index value at each vertex, we adopted the Closest Point Search (CPS) technique, essential to establish the correct topographical match of the same morphological points obtained with 3D GVF. For each point, CPS returned the mutual match between Civet's and Freesurfer's cortical thickness array. The entire process enabling the head-to-head comparison is illustrated in Fig. 1 .

C) Statistical difference maps (p<0.01 FDR-corrected). No significant voxels were found comparing CTR to sMCI. Atrophic areas were found contrasting pMCI with CTR (i.e.: the posterior cingulate, temporal lobe and frontal gyrus) with both tools. Comparing CTR versus AD the ROI (see Fig. 5 panels A and B) within the CTR and pMCI patients, which represent the most appropriate population for innovative clinical trial designs.\nIn the CTR group, the relationship between pipelines' cortical thickness and cognitive function or hippocampal atrophy was generally weak (-0.2 < r < 0.2), cross-sectionally and longitudinally. This was expected due to the absence of the disease in these completely asymptomatic subjects. However, significant differences between Civet and Freesurfer were found in few areas (i.e.: frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal).\nIn pMCI, the product momentums grew up to a medium and high levels (-0.27 < r < 0.64) especially for some expected ROIs, such as: precuneus cortex, cingulate and parahippocampal gyri. Significant differences between Civet and Freesurfer were found in a number of ROIs (i.e.: frontal, parietal, occipital, limbic, and temporal). Both Civet and Freesurfer cortical thickness measurements correlate better with hippocampal atrophy measurements than with neuropsychological tests. Fig. 6 shows the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves used to discriminate pMCI and AD patients from the CTR group at baseline, together with the longitudinal cortical pattern used to discriminate pMCI. Identifying the most informative ROI was mandatory to reduce the dimensionality problem. In order to maximize the discriminatory power, we adopted a sequential forward search strategy (i.e., adding successive ROIs to the target set) as feature selection criterion. The goal was to find the best combination of ROIs for both tools with the highest discriminatory power. The best ROIs used to generate the final ROCs were different in each curve and for each algorithm. We started selecting those ROI with the highest effect size; at each further step, we assessed other ROIs with a medium-large effect size (d > 0. 8 "}, {"section_title": "ROC Analysis", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This study could be considered as a first attempt to verify the mutual strengths and weaknesses of Civet and Freesurfer in a real head-to-head challenge, at the precision level of the single voxel. In the literature, only phantom-based validation methods have been used [27, 28] but this kind of approach does not take into consideration every aspects of real data. We investigated and compared the performances of Civet and Freesurfer when applied to the same ADNI1 In CTR and sMCI, both pipelines report a very mild and widespread cortical thinning rate in the motor, somatosensory, verbal and visual association cortex. In pMCI, the atrophy peaks at rates around 0.3 mm in the medial temporal cortex, temporal-parietal-frontal neocortices, with sparing of the sensorimotor strip and of the visual cortex. In AD, the atrophy in the same areas accelerates beyond 0.4 mm. B) Disease effect maps. The mean estimate of the longitudinal disease effect in CTR and sMCI as computed by Freesurfer is greater, although Civet shows higher results in few scattered areas. Furthermore, in the entire disease spectrum, Freesurfer exhibited higher disease effect in the motor cortex. In pMCI, Civet exhibits a greater disease effect except for the cingulate gyrus, while in the AD group the exception is represented by the precuneus. C) Statistical difference maps (p<0.01 FDR-corrected). In CTR, Civet detects an atrophic cluster in the angular gyrus; while Freesurfer in the precuneus and in the temporo-occipital lobe. The pattern in sMCI was more reduced than in CTR. In pMCI Freesurfer was not able to find many regions detected by Civet with the same significance and extension (i.e.: orbital, triangulal, and opercular portion of the inferior frontal gyrus, transverse-temporal and groups which included subjects on the entire disease spectrum, as monitored in a 2-year time frame. The analyses showed commonalities and differences.\nCivet and Freesurfer are characterized by specific and distinctive procedures, making it difficult to compare their outputs. This problem was solved adopting a combined approach, applying both the GVF and CPS to ensure a robust comparison of meshes characterized by different morphometry and topography completely different. Thanks to the direct vertex-by-vertex cross-algorithm comparison, the differences between the two algorithms, with regard both to cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis, were analytically mapped.\nDifferences between thickness evaluation of the first test (MPRAGE) and that of the retest (MPRAGE-Repeat) did not appear, suggesting high repeatability. Both Civet's and Freesurfer's performances changed according to the disease stage, pointing out that neither algorithm can be considered better than the other, or the best acting. Freesurfer systematically underestimated the absolute thickness by about 1 mm if compared to Civet's performance. Explanations for this evidence are not trivial. However, the restriction of Freesurfer to 1.0 mm as resolution for the volumes to be processed could be one possible reason. Civet, relying on the volumetric Laplacian approach, can use higher resolutions (e.g.: 0.8 or 0.9 mm) often adopted in ADNI1. An important role might be also played by the different mathematical procedures used by the two tools when reconstructing the gray matter sheet. Moreover, the skeleton reconstruction method adopted by Civet to build the GM sheet tends to overestimate the cortical thickness in case of blurred regions (i.e.: regions affected by noise where CSF volume is small); on the other hand, Freesurfer relies on the inner white deformation surface approach, which can be strongly influenced by the anatomical accuracy of the surface reconstruction at both inner and outer boundaries, thus giving a partially unfair anatomical accuracy of the surface reconstruction and assessment of the cortical thickness.\nCross-sectionally, both algorithms were sensitive to cortical thinning in those cortical regions heavily affected by the neuropathology. Comparing CTR to pMCI, the regions of significance found by both tool were overlapping with the those found comparing CTR and AD, albeit smaller, indicating that the differences in cortical thinning are progressive and well detectable even before a formal diagnosis of AD. This means that both tools can detect the characteristic signature of AD. Both Civet and Freesurfer were able to efficiently differentiate CTR from the AD and pMCI. All the ROIs granting such a good discrimination rate belonged to the temporal lobe. An interesting consideration for future works is the possibility to use Civet and Freesurfer to differentiate AD in particular subclasses, namely familial AD, early onset AD, and late onset AD [29, 30] .\nLongitudinally, both pipelines showed more statistically atrophic clusters in CTR than in sMCI, but this should be considered as a confounding phenotypic effect due to demographic, numerosity, clinical and other genetic characteristics. Further analyses with a larger sample will be conducted to clarify this particular behaviour. In pMCI, Civet was able to highlight a characteristic atrophic pattern involving expected temporal areas, such as the inferior margin of central gyrus and extended lateral frontal-parietal areas, as expected. The Civet's mesial part of the superior frontal cortex, inferior parietal cortex, the superior temporal gyrus). Freesurfer was more sensitive in few scattered expected and unexpected regions. For both pipelines, the longitudinal AD shrinkage showed significant areas throughout the temporal, frontal and parietal lobes, consistently with the progression of the disease. Some shrivelling differences were detected in the anterior division of the cingulate, in the limbic lobe and in the cuneus. D) Overlapping and not-overlapping atrophic regions are shown. Significant voxels detected by both pipelines are in yellow; voxels detected only by Civet are in blue; voxels detected only by Freesurfer are in red.

Longitudinal ROI-based analysis. In the CTR group, no significant differences between ROIs were detected in the two pipelines at BSL. At M24, significant differences between the two pipelines were found in the: middle frontal gyrus; inferior frontal gyrus-pars triangularis; superior parietal lobule; anterior division of the supramarginal gyrus; anterior and posterior division of the superior temporal gyrus. Longitudinally, no significant differences between ROIs were detected higher effect size and its more representative cortical signature suggest that this tool can detect the typical atrophic patterns in subject that will convert to AD within 2 years more efficiently. In the discriminant analysis, Civet produced an AUC slightly lower than that produced by Freesurfer; but this was probably due to random noises that confuses classifiers, producing changes hard to predict and control. Additional explanation can be related to the fact that longitudinally, on a vertex-by-vertex basis, Civet showed a more extensive effect than Freesurfer, while on a ROI basis the differences between the pipelines were not significant. In the AD cohort both Freesurfer and Civet were analogously sensitive to the thinning in the two pipelines. In the pMCI group, significant difference between the two pipelines was found at BSL in the: anterior division of the superior temporal gyrus. At M24, significant difference between the two pipelines was found in the: superior division of the lateral occipital cortex. Longitudinally, no significant differences between ROIs were detected in the two pipelines.

In panels A and B, * symbol stands for p<0.05 (Steiger's z-test patterns. As far as the correlation between the cortical thinning and hippocampal atrophic rate is concerned, Freesurfer showed a better trend, probably due to the exploitation of the longitudinal stream. Given its progressive alteration along the MCI-to-AD course, cortical thickness seems to be a promising neuroimaging candidate marker. With few exceptions, the two algorithms showed robust multi-ROI correlation patterns fairly consistent with the usual clinical and regional neuroimaging biomarkers, thus producing new, 3D, global profiles of the disease progression.\nUltimately, having reliable 3D diagnostic markers would enable clinicians to identify and treat MCI patients who will evolve into AD patients in a timely manner, as disease-modifying treatments will become available.\nFuture studies, including the MR 3.0 Tesla field strength, additional time points, extended age range of subject, larger and additional groups, might be helpful to further address the spatial and temporal atrophic pattern of the Alzheimer's changes.\nFreesurfer and Civet have been validated against either histological analysis or manual measurements [31] [32] [33] [34] , but none of them has been contrasted against different stages of the Alzheimer's pathology. Future works should focus on further validating both pipelines against a database of cortical thickness derived from a population of normal and abnormal cadaveric brains, such as those recently defined in the BigBrain initiative (https://bigbrain. loris.ca/).\nSome limitations should be considered in the interpretation of the present results. First, the tools here described need to be further compared with other recent available techniques, such as: Toads-Cruise [35] , ARCTIC [36] , MILXCTE [37] , DiReCT [38] , or CLADA [39] . Second, as expert manual rater in neuroimaging represents the gold standard, independent evaluators should compare the performance and accuracy of each automatic pipeline. Third, each tool should be validated against harmonized MR datasets, such as: standardized ADNI analysis dataset [40] , WW-ADNI [41] , AddNeuroMed [42] and OASIS [43] . Fourth, computational time is worth consideration: the extensive use of Civet or Freesurfer to analyse large volumes of data mandatorily requires HPC, Grid or Cloud resources, due to the protracted processing time needed. Additional developing and programming can make these algorithms more reliable, faster and slighter."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Both Civet and Freesurfer demonstrated high sensitivity to cortical gray matter changes crosssectionally and longitudinally.
