[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The Philippines implemented its educational reform commonly known as K to 12 Program in 2013 for Filipino learners' holistic development and global competitiveness."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "In its unending pursuit of true academic excellence, the Philippines instituted its educational reform called K to 12 Program upon the enactment of Republic Act (RA) No. 10533 known as Enhanced Basic Education Act 2013. With the intention of uplifting the Philippine educational system, possible indicators of reform's effectiveness would be the country's participation in international educational research studies such as the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). This international large-scale assessment is periodically conducted, which could provide feedback on how the Filipino students' performance has improved over time in an international setting from the time its basic education was just 10 years to now that it is K to 12.\nLooking back, the Philippines has participated in the first three testing periods of TIMSS in 1995 , 1999 and 2003 (Ogena, Brawner, & Ibe, 2013 . Then in 2008, it participated again in the TIMSS-Advanced designed to assess students' performance in their final year of secondary schooling with special preparation in advanced mathematics and physics (Ogena, Lan\u00e3, & Sasota, 2010) . TIMSS is an international large-scale assessment in mathematics and science at the fourth and eighth grades. The International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA), an independent international cooperative of national research institutions and government agencies, has been conducting TIMSS, which began in 1995 and with 70 participating countries in 2015 survey (Mullis, 2013: 3) .\nIn all cycles that Philippines participated in TIMSS, the results reveal dismal performance of the Filipino students. One explanatory factor to the Philippine's poor performance then was its 10-year basic education All efforts from the government in the implementation of this educational reform, including those coming from the private sectors, had their first round of evaluation at the end of school year 2017-2018 as the first batch of Senior High School (SHS) students graduated after six years of the implementation of the K to 12 Program. For six more years, in school year 2023-2024, the first batch of students who have completed the whole K to 12 program would have graduated. While still in the middle phase of the implementation of the K to 12 program, the effectiveness of such reform should be continuously monitored and documented. The success of the program could be gauged on a lot of factors including its ability to ensure that the SHS graduates become entrepreneurs, get employed or move to higher education depending on the track they took among Academic Track, Technical-Vocational-Livelihood Track, Sports Track, and Arts and Design Track (DepEd, 2018) . As indicated in Section 14 of R.A. 10533, there is a need for a mandatory evaluation and review of the K to 12 program to include reporting the results of the national achievement tests as one measure of quality of the program. It is emphasized in Section 15 of the law for DepEd to increase its per capita spending to attain international benchmarks as a possible gauge of the effectiveness of the educational reform.\nTo further test the effectiveness of such reform, DepEd has also formulated assessment policies that define the needs for the basic education students to take classroom and national examinations and participate in international large-scale assessments. In DepEd Order No. 8, s. 2015, classroom assessment is viewed as an important part of curriculum implementation as it shows students' learning progress and teachers' effectiveness in their instruction. Likewise, the DepEd Order No. 55 s. 2016 puts value on the national assessments in monitoring the Philippine educational system and the schools for public accountability. Moreover, the Deped No. 29, s 2017 underscored the importance of system assessment in the K to 12 Reform particularly in providing the bases for the implementation of the national and international large-scale assessments in determining the education system's effectiveness and efficiency. These policy guidelines on assessment are being implemented in Philippine public and private elementary and secondary schools.\nIn the private sector, Rex Institute for Student Excellence (RISE), the assessment company under Rex Group of Companies, also finds ways to contribute to providing indicators of the effectiveness of the K to 12 Program. As a result of its participation in the IEA's International Research Conference (IRC) in 2017 held in Czech Republic, it"}, {"section_title": "Contribution of this paper to the literature", "text": "\u2022 This paper's contribution to literature is its illustration of a process in determining the preparation of a country in participating in international large-scale assessment through curriculum mapping. In this study for example, the extent of readiness of the Philippines to participate in the TIMSS 2019 was determined through the mapping of its recent K to 12 Curriculum that has been implemented by schools with the assessment competencies that were covered in TIMSS. The results of the participation of the Philippines in the TIMSS 2019 could be explained by the degree of alignment of the curriculum with the competencies covered by the international assessment. The study could also be an addition to the limited literature that can be found about the Philippine's participation in TIMSS and other international-large scale assessment."}, {"section_title": "EURASIA J Math Sci and Tech Ed", "text": "3 / 14 has developed assessment tools aligned with the competencies that TIMSS assesses. In doing this, it examined the alignment of the TIMSS 2015 competencies in Math and Science with those in the same areas in the Philippine K to 12 Curriculum. Specifically, the researchers in this company conducted this study to answer the following questions: 1) What is the extent of alignment of the TIMSS 2015 Mathematics Assessment Framework in Grade 4 and 8 to the Philippine K to 12 Mathematics Curriculum?; 2) What is the extent of alignment of the TIMSS 2015 Science Assessment Framework in Grade 4 and 8 to the Philippine K to 12 Science Curriculum?\nIt is hoped that this analysis will inform the DepEd of the level of preparedness of the Filipino students when Philippines participates in TIMSS 2019 to obtain possible indicators of the effectiveness of the educational reform introduced in the country in making the Filipino citizens globally competitive."}, {"section_title": "CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK", "text": "In conducting an analysis of the alignment of the Philippine K to 12 Curriculum to the TIMSS Assessment Framework, the 2016 DepEd released Mathematics and Science K to 10 curricula were examined.\nThe Philippine Mathematics Curriculum is conceived with the twin goals of developing students' critical thinking and problem solving. The contents are clustered into five strands: 1) Numbers and Number Sense; 2) Measurement; 3) Geometry; 4) Patterns & Algebra; and 5) Statistics and Probability (DepEd, August 2016). The domain on Numbers and Number Sense include concepts, operations and applications of numbers. Measurement focuses on measures and applications of length, mass, weight, capacity, time, money, temperature, angles, perimeter, area, surface area, and volume. Geometry focuses on the two-and three-dimensional figures. Patterns and Algebra studies patterns, relationships, and changes among shapes and quantities. Statistics and Probability focuses on skills in data collection, organization, and interpretation including making predictions about outcomes. Each domain has content and performance standards and competencies that are developed spirally to help students' mastery as they go to higher levels of learning.\nOn the other hand, the Philippine Science Curriculum, which starts in Grade 3, aims to develop scientific literacy among learners through the following learning domains: 1) understanding and applying scientific knowledge in local setting as well as global context whenever possible; 2) performing scientific processes and skills; and 3) developing and demonstrating scientific attitudes and values (DepEd, August 2016). The curriculum is learnercentered, inquiry-based, and evidence-based. The contents are intertwined with processes and applied in real contexts. Concepts and skills in the different fields in Science (i.e Life Sciences, Physics, Chemistry, and Earth Sciences) are presented in spiral progression to ensure deep understanding.\nLikewise, IEA has made its TIMSS Assessment Framework in 2015 for Mathematics, Numeracy and Science known to participating countries. According to Gronmo, Lindquist, Arora, and Mullis (2013: 11-27) , in the TIMSS 2015 Mathematics Grade 4 and 8 and Numeracy, there were two dimensions covered: content dimension, specifying the subject matter to be assessed; and the cognitive dimension, specifying the thinking processes to be assessed. The content dimension was based on the assessment framework in the previous TIMSS but with minimal revisions to make it reflective of the current curriculum of participating countries. For the cognitive dimension, three domains were targeted such as: knowing, applying and reasoning. According to Gronmo, Lindquist, Arora, and Mullis (2013, pp 24-27) , knowing refers to facts, concepts and procedures that students need to know; applying refers to use of knowledge and conceptual understanding in solving problems and answering questions; and reasoning refers to the act of solving non-routine problems, unfamiliar situations, complex contexts, or multi-step problems. The study covers only the two TIMSS assessments in mathematics (i.e. Grades 4 & 8) and excluded numeracy as there was no clear document different from the K to 10 mathematics curriculum to examine for this part in the Philippine context.\nIn Mathematics for Grade 4, TIMSS 2015 covered three domains with varying weights: Number (50%), Geometric Shapes and Measures (35%); and Data Display (15%). In the Number Domain, Whole Numbers was given 25%, Fractions and Decimals was given 15%, and Expressions, Simple Equations, and Relationship was given 10%. The contents of the rest of the domains were equally distributed. In terms of cognitive dimensions, both knowing and applying are given 40% of items while reasoning is allotted 20% only.\nIn Grade 8 Mathematics, four content domains in the TIMSS 2015 were tested: 1) Number (30%); Algebra (30%); Geometry (20%); and Data and Chance (20%). The competencies in the eighth grade are built on the content of the fourth grade, hence they are more complex with the assumption that the students have developed proficiency in mathematics in the lower grade. The distribution of items for the cognitive dimensions, knowing items only weighed 35% , applying was still 40%, and reasoning increased to 25%.\nIn TIMSS 2015 Science Framework, the previous assessment framework was used with minor updates as well to better reflect the curricula of participating countries and current international initiatives in science education (Jones, Wheeler, & Centurino, 2013) . Similarly, TIMSS Science covered two dimensions: content and cognitive. The content domains in Science Grade 4 are: 1) Life Science (45%), 2) Physical Science (35%), and 3) Earth Science (20%). In TIMSS 2015 Science Grade 8, four content domains were covered, namely: 1) Biology (35%), 2) Chemistry (20%);\n3) Physics (25%); and 4) Earth Science (20%). The cognitive dimensions are: 1) knowing, which addresses the students' ability to recall, recognize, and describe facts, concepts, and procedures that are necessary for a solid foundation in science; 2) applying, which focuses on using knowledge to generate explanation and solve practical problems; and 3) reasoning, which includes using evidence and science understanding to analyze, synthesize, and generalize often in unfamiliar situations and complex contexts (Jones, Wheeler, & Centurino, 2013, p 60) . Both Grade 4 and 8 Science use the same cognitive dimensions in the assessment just like that in Mathematics but the distribution of items differs. In Science Grade 4, same as in Mathematics, knowing and applying weighed 40%, and reasoning weighed 20%. In Science Grade 8, the distribution is 35% for knowing, 35% for applying, and 30% for reasoning. Figure 1 shows how the researchers conceived this study. As shown, the content and cognitive domains in the TIMSS 2015 in Mathematics and Science Grade 4 and 8 were mapped with those in the Philippine K to 12 Intended Curriculum in Mathematics and Science. It was assumed that the degree of alignment of the two documents could predict readiness of the Philippines should it participate again in TIMSS."}, {"section_title": "METHODOLOGY", "text": "The study was a qualitative investigation of web-based curriculum documents. Bowen (2009) , describes this qualitative research inquiry as document analysis where the functions of documents as a data source are examined. In this study, subject area experts examined the alignment between the two curriculum documents to identify possible gaps. Mathematics and Science for Grade 4 (Gronmo, Lindquist, Arora, & Mullis, 2013: 11-24) and Grade 8 reported in the TIMSS 2015 Assessment Report (Jone, Wheeler, & Centurino, 2013: 29-54) were mapped against the 2016 K to 12 Mathematics and Science Curriculum of DepEd. To the Great Schools Partnership (2013), this process is called curriculum mapping as it entails indexing or diagramming a curriculum to identify and address gaps, redundancies, and misalignments for purposes of improving the overall coherence of a course of study and its effectiveness.\nIn doing the document analysis or curriculum mapping, three content specialists per subject area were trained and guided on the process. Two independent experts did the mapping and reported analyses in a matrix form. A third expert was engaged to check and validate the work of the two other experts. Heat mapping, which is a technique in representing data graphically using the system of color coding of different values (Wikipedia, 2018) or a tool in visualizing data (Juneau, 2015) was done. In this study, four color codes were used to indicate levels of alignment in content domains: green, yellow, orange and no color. A competency in the K to 12 that is shaded green means it is fully matched with TIMSS in the same grade level. If coded yellow, it means the competency is covered at a lower level. If orange, the competency is covered in a higher level, which would signify that they were not developed yet at the time of assessment. If the competencies in TIMSS 2015 Framework were not shaded, this means they were not covered in the curriculum document. In terms of the cognitive dimensions, the content experts also used a matrix for analysis where all the competencies in the K to 12 Curriculum in Mathematics and Science were classified according to the three cognitive domains of knowing, applying, and reasoning in TIMSS.\nThere were four matrices prepared, one per subject area and per grade level. Triangulation technique was applied in this exercise where the content experts did their document analyses separately and independently then their work were compared to test the reliability of analysis. The degree of agreement in the analyses of two independent content experts per subject area in their mapping of all competencies in the documents was 85% (for Science) and 90% (Mathematics). Such percentage of agreement is considered high. For the competencies where the two hired content experts per area differed in their analyses, the third content expert adjudicated their analyses and finalized the categorization of competencies according to cognitive dimensions.\nTo determine the percentage of content competencies in Mathematics and Science Curriculum that were aligned to the TIMSS 2015 assessment competencies, the total number of competencies as stated in the TIMSS 2015 Framework for each subject area was the basis for the computation. To determine the distribution of competencies in the K to 12 Curriculum according to the cognitive dimensions, a simple percentage score was computed to represent competencies that are classified into knowing, applying and reasoning."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Alignment of TIMSS 2015 Grade 4 Mathematics Assessment Framework vis-\u00e0-vis", "text": "Philippine 2016 K to 12 Mathematics Curriculum"}, {"section_title": "Domain 1: Numbers", "text": "This domain covered three (3) topics to include Whole Numbers; Fractions and Decimals; and Expressions, Simple Equations, and Relationships (Gronmo, Lindquist, Arora, & Mullis, 2013) .\nWhole Numbers. Whole numbers in the TIMSS 2015 covered five (5) competencies: 1) demonstrating knowledge of place value; writing numbers in expanded form; representing numbers in words, diagrams and symbols; 2) comparing, ordering and rounding whole numbers; 3) computing with the four operations with whole numbers; 4) solving problems set in contexts including those involving measurements, money and simple operations; and 5) identifying odd and even numbers and multiples and factors of numbers (Gronmo, Lindquist, Arora, & Mullis, 2013) . All the TIMSS Math Grade 4 competencies on whole numbers were mapped with the Philippine K to 12 competencies in Mathematics in the same grade level. The alignment of whole number competencies in the Philippine curriculum with TIMSS 2015 is good for the country compared to what other countries have reported like Turkey and New York State claiming that these competencies have been covered starting grade one to higher grade levels (Incikabi, Ozgelen, & Tjoe, 2012) ."}, {"section_title": "Fractions and Decimals.", "text": "Fractions and decimals in TIMSS 2015 covered three (3) competencies: 1) recognizing fractions as parts of wholes, parts of a collections, or locations on number lines, and represent fractions using words, number, or models; 2) identifying equivalent simple fractions; comparing and ordering simple fractions; adding and subtracting simple fractions, including those set in problem situations; and 3) demonstrating knowledge of decimal place value including representing decimals using words, numbers, or models; comparing, ordering, and rounding decimals; adding and subtracting decimals, including those set in problem situations (Gronmo, Lindquist, Arora, & Mullis, 2013) . When these competencies were mapped with the Philippine K to 12 competencies, the first competency was mapped in Grade 1 to 4 and the rest in the same grade level. The 100% alignment of the TIMSS Grade 4 competencies on fractions and decimals to the Grade 4 curriculum is good but studies have reported that items on fractions usually are found difficult to the students (Wijaya, 2017) .\nExpressions, Simple Equations, and Relationships. Expressions, Simple Equations, and Relationships in the TIMSS 2015 covered three (3) competencies, namely: 1) finding the missing number or operation in a number sentence (e.g., 17 + w = 29); 2) identifying or writing expressions or number sentences to represent problem situations involving unknowns; and 3) identifying and using relationships in a well-designed pattern (e.g., describe the relationship between adjacent terms and generate pairs of whole numbers given a rule) (Gronmo, Lindquist, Arora, & Mullis, 2013) . All competencies were mapped with the same grade level in the Philippine curriculum. This means that when the Filipino Grade 4 students are assessed in TIMSS Mathematics, the competencies under Number Domain should not cause any difficulty to them as they are covered in their curriculum."}, {"section_title": "Domain 2: Geometric Shapes and Measures", "text": "This domain covered two (2) topics to include Points, Lines, and Angles; and Two-and Three-Dimensional Shapes (Gronmo, Lindquist, Arora, & Mullis, 2013) .\nPoints, Lines, and Angles. There were four (4) competencies under this dimension: 1) measuring and estimating lengths; 2) identifying and drawing parallel and perpendicular lines.; 3) identifying, comparing, and drawing different types of angles (e.g., a right angle, and angles larger or smaller than a right angle); and 4) using informal coordinate systems to locate points in a plane (Gronmo, Lindquist, Arora, & Mullis, 2013) . All the first three competencies were found in the same grade level except for competency 4, which was not covered in the curriculum in the elementary level. The introduction to the coordinate system was introduced in Grade 8 Mathematics and not in the Grade 4 or lower grades. Items on this competency in the TIMSS assessment are expected to be difficult then for the students as they have not been exposed to this competency in their current grade. Two-and Three-dimensional Shapes. Three (3) competencies were covered: 1) using elementary properties to describe and compare common two-and three-dimensional geometric shapes, including line and rotational symmetry; 2) relating three-dimensional shapes with their two-dimensional representations; and 3) calculating perimeters of polygons, areas of squares and rectangles, and estimating areas and volumes of geometric figures by covering with a given shape or by filling with cubes (Gronmo, Lindquist, Arora, & Mullis, 2013) . Among these three competencies, the first competency was developed from Grade 2 to 4 of the K to 12 while the two competencies were covered in the same grade level."}, {"section_title": "Domain 3: Data Display", "text": "This domain covered only one (1) topic and that is Reading, Interpreting, and Representing.\nReading, Interpreting, and Representing. The two (2) competencies under this topic mapped with Grade 4 K to 12 Mathematics and these are: 1) reading, comparing, and representing data from tables, pictographs, bar graphs, line graphs and pie charts; and 2) using information from data displays to answer questions that go beyond directly reading the data displayed (Gronmo, Lindquist, Arora, & Mullis, 2013) .\nIn summary, of the 20 listed competencies (11 from Number Domain, 7 from Geometric Shapes and Measures Domain, and 2 from Data Display Domain) in the TIMSS 2015 Grade 4 Mathematics, 90% were mapped to the target grade, 5% mapped in a lower grade and 5% is not covered. The competency on the introduction to the coordinate system in Geometric Shapes and Measures Domain is developed in Grade 8 Mathematics, which could be a problematic area to Grade 4 students when Philippines participates in TIMSS. In terms of the cognitive dimensions, about 9% of the competencies in the K to 12 curriculum are classified as knowing domain, 58% are under applying domain, and 33 % are under reasoning domain. This means that the students should be able to cope with the content and cognitive demands of the assessment as all the dimensions in the TIMSS are aligned with the curriculum."}, {"section_title": "Earth's Processes and History.", "text": "With reference to the TIMSS science framework (Jone, Wheeler, & Centurino, 2013) , two (2) competencies about water on Earth and in the air were both covered in the curriculum. Moreover, two (2) competencies on daily, seasonal, and historical processes on Earth were covered. One (1) competency was not covered and this is about recognizing that some remains (fossils) of animals and plants that lived on Earth a long time ago are found in rocks and make simple deductions about changes in Earth's surface from the location of these remains.\nEarth in the Solar System. Based on the TIMSS science framework (Jone, Wheeler, & Centurino, 2013) , the first competency on objects in the solar system and their movements was covered. However, the 2 nd competency was not covered, and this is about recognizing that the Moon revolves around Earth, and from Earth it looks different at different times of the month. On Earth's motion and related patterns observed on Earth, the first competency was covered in Grade 3. However, the 2 nd competency that is on explaining how seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres are related to Earth's annual movement around the Sun was covered in higher grades.\nIn summary, out of the 66 competencies (31 competencies under Life Science, 21 competencies under Physical Science, and 14 competencies under Earth Science) covered by the TIMSS assessment, only 37 or about 56% of the competencies in the K-12 curriculum are reflected in Grade 4 Science Curriculum, 19 or 29% is covered in Grade 3, nine (9) or 14 % is covered in higher grades, and one (1) or 1% is not explicitly reflected in the curriculum. This means that only 56 or about 85% of the TIMSS 2015 Assessment in Science Grade 4 were covered explicitly by the Philippine's curriculum in Grades 3 to 4 Science. In terms of the cognitive domains, 19% of the competencies are classified to be under knowing, 54% is under applying and 27% are under reasoning. This means that there are gaps in the Grade 4 curriculum in terms of content but not necessarily in the cognitive requirements of the TIMSS Science Grade 4."}, {"section_title": "Alignment of TIMSS 2015 Assessment Framework for Grade 8 Science vis-\u00e0-vis", "text": "Philippine 2016 K to 12 Science Curriculum"}, {"section_title": "Domain 1: Biology", "text": "The six (6) topics under Biology include 1) Characteristics and Life Processes of Organisms; 2) Cells and Their Functions; 3) Life Cycles, Reproduction, and Heredity; 4) Diversity, Adaptation, and Natural Selection; 5) Ecosystems; and 6) Human Health (Jone, Wheeler, & Centurino, 2013) .\nCharacteristics and Life Processes of Organisms. With reference to the TIMSS science framework (Jone, Wheeler, & Centurino, 2013) , the two (2) competencies about the differences among major taxonomic groups of organisms and the three (3) competencies on structure and function of major organ systems were covered in the grades lower than Grade 8. However, the two (2) competencies on physiological processes of animals were covered sources of evidence for climate changes, such as those that occur during ice ages or that are related to global warming is developed in Grade 9, which is learned after the students have taken Grade 8.\nEarth's Resources, Their Use and Conservation. Looking at the TIMSS science framework (Jone, Wheeler, & Centurino, 2013) , the four (4) competencies on managing Earth's resources are introduced in Grade 4 to 8. The two competencies on land and water use are developed in Grade 9 or higher and these are: 1) explaining how common methods of land use, such as farming, logging, or mining can affect land and water resources; 2) explaining the importance of water conservation, and describe how purification, desalinization, and irrigation ensure that fresh water is available for human activities.\nEarth in the Solar System and the Universe. Based on the TIMSS science framework (Jone, Wheeler, & Centurino, 2013) , the competency on observable phenomena on Earth resulting from movements of Earth and the Moon, which is, distinguishing between the effects of Earth's daily rotation about its axis and its annual revolution around the Sun, including how Earth's rotation and revolution relate to the appearance of constellations in the sky is not explicitly stated in the intended curriculum. The two other competencies under this dimension are developed in Grades 6 and 7. For the two competencies on Features of Earth, the Moon, and other planets, both are covered in Grade 6.\nIn Summary, out of the 119 stated competencies covered (36 in Biology, 23 in Chemistry, 34 in Physics, and 26 in Earth Science) , 21 or 18% is developed in Grade 8 of the Philippine Science Curriculum, 52 or 44% is developed below Grade 8, 42 or 35% is developed after Grade 8, and 4 or 3% is not explicitly stated from Grade 3 to Grade 10 of the curriculum. This means that 73 competencies or about 61% of the TIMSS 2015 Assessment in Science Grade 8 is learned by the Filipino students in Grade 8 or in lower grades based on the intended science curriculum. However, in terms of the cognitive dimensions, 6% of the competencies in Science 8 curriculum are classified under knowing, 71% are under applying, and 23% are under reasoning. Given the significant number of the competencies in TIMSS 2015 Grade 8 Science that are not explicitly reflected in the curriculum and the lower percentage of reasoning among the competencies, it would be difficult to assume that the Filipino students would be ready to perform well in TIMSS Science Grade 8 in 2019 should the framework for assessment is the same as in 2015."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Summary of the Study:", "text": "The study intends to determine the extent of alignment of the 2015 TIMSS Assessment Framework with the Philippine K to 12 Curriculum in Mathematics and Science released in the DepEd's website in 2016, which is the reference of all instructional and assessment materials developed for use of schools in the Philippines. The results of the document analysis reveal that TIMSS 2015 Assessment Framework in Mathematics is more aligned with the intended curriculum of the Philippine Grade 4 Mathematics Curriculum (i.e. 95% aligned) than that of the Grade 8 Mathematics Curriculum (i.e. about 88% aligned). TIMSS 2015 Assessment Framework in Science is more aligned with the intended curriculum of the Philippine Grade 4 Science Curriculum (i.e. about 85% aligned) than that of the Grade 8 Science Curriculum (i.e. about 61% aligned). As a whole, the K to 12 Curriculum in Mathematics is more aligned with TIMSS 2015 Framework than that in Science.

The investigation covered only the cognitive assessment and failed to capture the surveys to students, teachers and school heads. Other international large-scale assessments like Program for International Reading and Literacy Survey (PIRLS) and Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) were not also included in the analysis though they could also provide possible indicators of the effectiveness of the educational reform. Finally, the reference for mapping in this study was the TIMSS 2015 Assessment Framework as the TIMSS 2019 Assessment Framework (Mullin & Martin, 2017) was not out yet at the time this study was conducted.\nSuggestions for Future Studies: Given the limitations of the study, it is recommended that future studies be focused on the analysis of the TIMSS Numeracy and TIMSS Advanced to deepen the analysis of the results. Other international large-scale assessments like PIRLS and PISA should also be investigated as to how they match with the Philippine Curriculum in making the quality of the educational system in the Philippines comparable with international standards. An analysis of the alignment of the Philippine K to 12 Curriculum to the TIMSS 2019 Framework is also encouraged to verify the degree of cognitive preparedness of the Filipino students in meeting the standards set in large-scale assessment considering its goal of making the Filipino students globally competitive. Other countries who intend to participate in TIMSS could also replicate the methodology of this study as preparation to participation in international large-scale assessment."}]
