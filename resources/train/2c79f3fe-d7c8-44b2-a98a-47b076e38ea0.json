However, some sea level research predicts that roughly half of the world's coastal wetlands will submerge within the 21st century CE due to sea level rise (SLR) acceleration (Kirwan et al., 2010). Salt marshes are critical indicators of relative sea level (RSL), in addition to their ecological value, historical importance as human food sources, and coastal storm buffering effects, and they are threatened by the very thing which they allow us to measure; rising RSL. Salt marsh conditions are dictated by internal and external controls, the internal controls being salt tolerant halophytic vegetation and autocompaction, while the external controls are RSL, tidal regimes, and sediment supply systems (Allen, 2000). Through lithostratigraphic, chemostratigraphic, and geospatial studies, the nature of the subject marsh and its sediments can be investigated, shedding light on the RSL history of the study area and quantifying the recent human impacts upon the marsh. In order to understand the nature of the modern transgression, it is necessary to reconstruct past RSL from marsh deposits. To build these reconstructions in a reliable manner, the understanding of human impacts must be improved upon. These factors create the impetus to evaluate the RSL history of and anthropogenic effects upon the salt marsh deposits at Jones Narrows, which lies within a Holocene RSL data gap zone (Hawkes et al., 2016) along the Atlantic coast of Georgia and has been heavily impacted by human activity during the Anthropocene (1800CE -Present) (Crutzen and Stoermer, 2000) (Fig. 1). Adjacent to the Isle of Hope and Wormsloe State Historic Site, Jones Narrows sits between two relict barrier islands and is part of the extensive system of intertidal salt marshes on the Georgia Coast. Due to the history of human interaction with Jones Narrows, which includes the construction of several causeways and major artificial channels nearby, it provides an opportunity to study not only the natural history of the marsh, but also the decadal effects of direct anthropogenic impacts. Outside of their intrinsic ecological importance, salt marshes are valuable to humanity in their capacity to act as unique habitats for a variety of endemic species, in their role as tidal and wave energy buffers between the open ocean and terrestrial areas, and in their ability to function as carbon sinks (Townend et al., 2011). In order to gain some sense of how these fragile environments will respond to the potential environmental changes of the coming century, it is imperative that the scientific community investigates modern salt marsh conditions and past dynamics, both natural and anthropogenic. Holocene relative sea level reconstructions are crucial to the understanding of rheology models of the Earth and provide necessary data for estimating rates of ongoing glacio-isostatic adjustment (GIA), while also helping to correct estimates of Greenland and Antarctic ice loss for the effect of GIA (Engelhart and Horton, 2012). Without the assessment of RSL change due to GIA and other land level change, the isolation of climate change induced eustatic sea level trends is difficult (Kemp et al., 2014). The quality of Holocene relative sea level data for the United States Atlantic Coast is a major limiting factor for refining GIA models, and this is a key region for Holocene data due to its nature as an independent constraint on GIA (Engelhart and Horton, 2012). The gap in RSL data sets along the coasts of Georgia and Florida have prevented RSL reconstructions and the estimate of subsidence rates in the region, data without which coastal planning and Earth-ice models will suffer (Kemp et al., 2014)."}, {"section_title": "Figure 1: Index Map -Study area location on the Georgia Bight", "text": "Additionally, late Holocene RSL reconstructions provide data for comparison with past climate variability, giving evidence that historic rates of sea level rise have been greater than the background trend over the previous centuries or more (Kemp et al., 2014). Southeastern U.S. salt marshes have endured rates of sea level rise higher than those we see today, having survived a period 7 mm/yr rise in the mid-Holocene, however, models predict that the modern SLR rate (between 2-3 mm/yr) will increase to 5 mm/yr -50 mm/yr, surpassing any rates that have occurred in the Holocene, thus far (Kirwan and Megonigal, 2013). To further the progress of necessary late Holocene RSL research on the Georgia Coast, this study will examine the sedimentary sequence and marsh conditions at Jones Narrows Marsh and address the following questions: 1) What is the local late Holocene trend of RSL change at Jones Narrows?; 3) Can the anthropogenic impacts to Jones Narrows marsh be discerned and quantified through vibracore data analysis, radiocarbon analysis, and spatial analysis methods?; 3) Can distinct and meaningful geochemical suites of sediment that correlate to depositional subenvironments and/or anthropogenic impacts be identified through the analysis of X-ray fluorescence data derived from the vibracore sediment data?"}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "A complex web of controls influences the nature of salt marshes, including relative sea level, tidal and sediment supply regimes, halophytic vegetation, sedimentary autocompaction, and, from the mid-Holocene forward, anthropogenic forces (Allen, 2000). The interactions of these controls affect the ability of salt marshes to survive RSL changes through accretion and/or lateral movement. Accommodation space can be created through the combined effects of rising RSL and autocompaction, and this space can be filled via growth and sedimentation on marsh surfaces (Allen, 2000). Halophytic marsh vegetation plays a major role in sedimentation processes on marsh surfaces. Marsh vegetation contributes organic particles to the marsh and resists flow by creating friction, thereby reducing water velocity and inducing accretion of sediment introduced by tides and waves (Allen, 2000). Vegetative growth greatly enhances marsh accretion, although the specifics of the vegetation species control the behavior of the marsh (D'Alpaos et al., 2007). On the Georgia Bight and in many other coastal regions, the tall salt marsh cordgrass Spartina alterniflora is one of the most important halophytes. In spite of the role that Spartina grasses play in the accretion of sediment within salt marshes, the development of Spartina saltmarshes is closely related to the supply of fine grained sediments in the regional setting (Yong-Ming et al., 2008). Spartina alterniflora is not the only halophyte that proliferates within salt marsh environments, and with the variety of vegetation types comes a variety of interactions with sediment; along with S. alterniflora, other similar common halophytes are Phragmites australis, Juncus sp., and Aster tripolium, all of which possess a variety of abilities for catching sediment and promoting deposition (Temmerman et al., 2004). Generally, halophyte spatial growth density increases flow resistance and deposition (Townend et al., 2011). Not only do the different halophyte species affect the nature of sedimentation, but they also influence creek bank stability in a variety of ways (Chen et al., 2012). The wave energy baffling effect of marsh grasses causes fine sediment to fall out of suspension and gives salt marshes their characteristic morphology (Fig. 2); as the grasses enhance settling rates at the banks of tidal creeks, the suspended sediment available rapidly decreases with distance away from the creek banks (Townend et al., 2011). The aftermath of the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill illustrates the dependence of marsh stability upon vegetation health; the plant death that took place consequently caused massive increases in rates of marsh-edge erosion and the erosion of historically stable channels (Kirwan and Megonigal, 2013). Reduced halophyte health and subsequent marsh erosion have also been induced by natural disasters, and these events have illustrated how various halophyte species react differently to high energy forces; higher salinity marshes are dominated by species with deeper root profiles, and, during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, these marshes endured less damage than those lower salinity marshes dominated by halophyte species with shallower roots (Kirwan and Megonigal, 2013). Worldwide, the three most important sources sediment supply for salt marshes are river catchments, retreating coastal cliffs, and proximal seafloor formations, yet, sediment supply regimes remain poorly understood in terms of the mineral texture and mineral content supplied, which, in turn, control channel equilibrium marsh growth (Allen, 2000). Low marsh accretion is strongly influenced by changes in sediment supply, while accretion in high marsh zones is more heavily influenced by sea level change and other hydrologic factors (Haslett et al., 2003). While fine grained sediment supply is especially important for the accretion on the marsh surface, sand sized grain accretion is also important for the building of salt marshes (V. de Groot et al., 2011). Although sand contribution to overall marsh sediment is minor (<10%), it is vital to the initial stages of marsh formation, and the sources of marsh sand can be highly variable; they include intertidal flats, marsh creeks, and aeolian sands from beach plains, dunes, and washover deposits (V. de Groot et al., 2011). Other studies (Fagherazzi et al., 2012;Ma et al., 2014) have contended that storm events, not suspended sediment, are responsible for long-term accretion rates on salt marshes. Halophyte vegetation and sediment supply have great influence over salt marsh conditions, however, tidal regimes and RSL have ultimate control over marsh accretion and erosion. RSL variation can control whether a marsh is dominated by organogenic or mineralogenic particles (Allen, 2000) and whether or not marsh accretion can reach equilibrium (Bartholdy et al., 2010). Generally, changes in RSL are due to the simultaneous effects of GIA, ocean mass, and ocean volume, with RSL variability along the U.S. Atlantic margin having been dominated by land subsidence and geoid fall, both driven primarily by the retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and the collapse of its proglacial forebulge (Kemp et al., 2014). Plate tectonic motion-induced dynamic topography and sediment compaction also have effects on RSL trends, the quantification of which, along with GIA induced change, is vital in order to isolate climate related sea level trends (Kemp et al., 2014). Many researchers suggest that tidal salt marshes will not be able to keep pace with predictions of local RSL rise (Hughes et al., 2009). Marsh equilibrium may be achieved under rising sea levels, however, SLR rates in excess of the equilibrium rate can drown marshes (Bartholdy et al., 2010). Conversely, without sea level rise or under rates of rise below equilibrium rates, marshes grow to the upper extent of their tidal ranges, over time, and decay due to exposure (Bartholdy et al., 2010). So, while salt marshes have proliferated during the modern marine transgression, with RSL rise often causing rapid vegetative growth, observations of recently submerged marshes indicate that there are certainly limits upon the abilities of marshes to withstand high rates of SLR, in spite of the positive feedback between marsh sedimentation, vegetation, and rising seas (Kirwan et al., 2010). Submergence is a key component of marsh existence within the intertidal zone, as the amount of time that a marsh is submerged (hydroperiod) increases the amount of sedimentation upon the marsh; however, excessive submergence stresses marsh vegetation, eventually reducing bioproductivity within the marsh (Townend et al., 2011). Hydroperiod is mostly controlled by the tidal range at a given marsh location, so inorganic (mineralogenic) sedimentation dominates the low marsh while organic sedimentation dominates the high marsh, indicating that the drowning of halophytic vegetation in organic sediment dominated marshes will dramatically reduce accretion ability (Townend et al., 2011). Rapid SLR induced marsh deterioration has already been observed in some regions (Kirwan and Guntenspergen, 2012), including the Delaware Bay (Stammerman and Piasecki, 2012). According to Kirwan and Megonigal, 2013, mean RSL has risen 1 mm/yr for most of the last 2000 years, but the present rate is roughly 2-3 mm/yr. Vegetation has responded to this increased rate of rise, and, in New England, the inundation tolerant Spartina alterniflora has proliferated, replacing the prior occupant: the less flood resistant Spartina patens (Kirwan and Megonigal, 2013). Other estimates of recent rates of global sea level rise indicate 3.5 mm/yr (Webb et al., 2013). With ice sheet melt included in predictions, near future rates of sea level rise could reach 50 mm/yr (Kirwan and Megonigal, 2013). Most current models of increased rates of sea level rise, be they conservative or aggressive, at minimum predict the upland migration of the vegetated zones within marshlands and the loss of vegetation diversity (Fagherazzi et al., 2012), without consideration of the potential effects of anthropogenic barriers. Additionally, in the face of quickly rising seas, the process of sediment autocompaction is one that some researchers believe needs to be included in measurements of past rates of accretion and predictions of future marsh survival. Sediment autocompaction can exert a major secondary control on marsh deposition and behavior, and it can limit the accuracy of estimates of paleo sealevel by distorting sedimentary stratigraphy. Autocompaction even has the ability to generate accommodation space in peat marshes at the same rate as SLR, dramatically distorting stratigraphic sequences and introducing significant error into SLR rate estimates (Allen, 2000). Autocompaction can cause measurements of deeper sediments to appear to indicate successively lower accretion rates, even under constant sediment input rates (Bartholdy et al., 2010). Alternatively, other studies have suggested that autocompaction does not generate artificial sea level trends, despite the relative contribution of compaction to reconstructed sea level change being 12 percent (Brain et al., 2014). Brain et al. (2014), using a model that allowed samples to be returned to their original depositional altitudes via depth specific estimates of autocompaction, were able to define statistically significant relationships between organic content, initial void space, and compression indices which allowed for estimation of sedimentspecific compression properties; their model shows that the maximum absolute contribution of autocompaction to sea-level reconstruction is 0.07 mm/yr, suggesting that it is possible to reliably compensate for autocompaction in paleo RSL reconstruction studies in marshes. Anthropogenic controls on marsh evolution, such as embankments utilized by urban and agricultural practices, constrain upland migration of marshes, which could cause SLR to destroy marshes left with nowhere to relocate (Webb et al., 2013). Dams and reservoirs prevent roughly twenty percent of global sediment load from reaching coasts, and this effect, combined with reforestation and sediment control practices, could cause currently stable marshes to collapse in the future, even if SLR rates remain steady (Kirwan and Megonigal, 2013). With the aforementioned marsh controls and dynamics in mind, although they are far from exhaustive, it becomes evident that the salt marsh at Jones Narrows, not only an appropriate study area for late Holocene RSL trends, also provides an opportunity to study the powerful effects of human activity on salt marsh sedimentation, hydrology, and vegetation.\nGeorgia's salt marshes lie within the higher reaches of the intertidal zone, from mean neap high tide to mean spring high tide (Frey and Basan, 1978). The salt marsh subenvironments of the Georgia Bight are distinct and identifiable by evaluating the lithofacies, biofacies, and ichnofacies present (Edwards and Frey, 1977). Tidal stream channel banks demarcate the lower bound of the salt marsh, while the upper boundary generally lies in contact with the mainland or the remnants of Pleistocene or Holocene barrier islands (Frey and Howard, 1980). The upper bound of the low marsh, where it transitions to high marsh, lies at roughly higher high tide (mean annual higher of daily high tide) (Howard and Frey, 1980). Building on this, Engelhart and Horton, 2012, have established a method by which an indicative range (e.g., mean high water to mean tide level for low marsh deposits) is assigned to samples based upon interpreted depositional environment with respect to a reference water level; in this case, mean tide level provides the sample with an indicative meaning. With the relationships between MSL and salt marsh sub-environmental elevations in mind, a reconstruction and assessment of local sedimentation rate and Holocene sea level reconstruction is made possible via radiocarbon analysis of in-situ organic material, indicative range assessments, error calculations, and age data calibration."}, {"section_title": "Research Questions", "text": "This study addresses the following questions: 1) What does the record of sedimentary deposition at Jones Narrows marsh reveal about late Holocene RSL?; 2) What is the nature of anthropogenic impacts upon the marsh, and can they be discerned and quantified through vibracore data analysis, radiocarbon analysis, and spatial analysis methods?; 3) Can XRF analysis reveal meaningful geochemical data that correspond with sedimentary facies and interpreted depositional environs? The RSL reconstruction created by this research will be useful not only in helping to fill an important research gap, but, through comparison with previous Holocene RSL reconstructions, it can help confirm and inform RSL curves generated by other researchers. To be able to accurately and practically assess the nature of late Holocene RSL changes in the study area, anthropogenic impacts must also be investigated and quantified. This component of the research is not only important specifically to study area in question, but also in its potential application to the assessment of other similarly impacted modern marshes. Spatial analysis provides a crucial component of the characterization of the scale of anthropogenic impacts to the marsh in question, allowing for the area and volume of unnatural deposition to be measured in addition to generally documenting and the historic visible changes to the marsh topography, hydrology, and deposition. Building on the research methods of other geochemical investigations of Georgia barrier island system deposits (Meyer, 2013) the XRF investigations will allow for further analysis and quantification of the anthropogenic effects to marsh sediments, while also attempting to investigate the potential application of XRF data as a tool for the characterization and identification of salt marsh depositional subenvironments through statistical methods. In addition, the current study should provide a baseline in assessing the environmental history of Jones Marsh. The Wormsloe State Historic Site is currently utilized for ecological research and an understanding of the lateral and vertical anthropogenic impacts resulting from the placement of dredged fill materials should assist in discerning natural and successional environments."}, {"section_title": "STUDY AREA", "text": "The study area of Jones Narrows is located on Wormsloe State Historic Site, which encompasses the southern half of Isle of Hope and its adjacent salt marshes (Fig. 2). Six vibracores were extracted from the marsh to the east of the southern tip of the Isle of Hope, and two were extracted from the more upland areas of the Isle. "}, {"section_title": "Geologic Setting", "text": "The Isle of Hope is situated 10 miles inland from the Atlantic Ocean and the modern barrier, Wassaw Island, and it is part of the barrier island complex that runs along the southeastern coast of the United States. The study area lies within a section of the barrier island complex known as the Georgia Bight, a large regional embayment with the highest tides of the southern United States (Hubbard et al., 1979). This section of the coast is classified as mesotidal, with an average tidal range of 2.4 m and an average spring tide range of 3.4 m (Howard and Frey, 1985). The barrier islands of the Georgia coast are unique to the United States with their short curved compound beach ridges and relatively stable tidal inlets; all but two0 of Georgia's modern Holocene barriers are remnants of Pleistocene barriers upon which beach ridges have accreted during the Holocene epoch (Howard and Frey, 1980), forming \"doublets\" (Meyer, 2013) (Fig. 3b). The Pleistocene sequences of barriers, formed between ~110,000 and ~25,000 BP (years before present) (Howard and Frey, 1985), were produced by glacial melting induced submergences (Hoyt and Hails, 1967). Six major Pleistocene shorelines were created by this glacial melt pulsing, including the Wicomico (~29 to 30 m), Penholoway (~23 m), Talbot (~12 to 14 m), Princess Anne (~4.5 m), and the Silver Bluff (~1.5 m) (Hoyt and Hails, 1967) (Fig. 3a and 3c). The maximum sea level during the Quaternary in Georgia is considered to have formed the Wicomico Terrace coastal sedimentary deposits (Meyer, 2013). Radiocarbon dates suggest that the modern Holocene barriers formed prior to 4500 BP when sea level was 3.6 to 4.5 m below modern sea level (Hoyt, 1967). The Holocene components of the barrier islands represent the last 4000 to 5000 years of deposition, the amount of time elapsed since sea level reached its approximate current position following the Wisconsinian lowstand. While sea level appears to have reached ~1.5 to 2 m below MSL by 4500 BP, regression again lowered sea level to ~3 to 4 m around 3000 BP, with a subsequent transgression bringing sea level to its approximate modern elevation at ~2400 BP (Meyer, 2013)."}, {"section_title": "Salt Marshes of the Georgia Bight", "text": "Another way in which the barrier island complex of Georgia differs from the rest of the US Atlantic Coast barriers is in that, due to the relatively higher mass flux of tidal water, the Georgia backbarrier area contains greater expanses of salt marshes and tidal streams (Hayden and Dolan, 1979). The backbarrier area of Georgia covers an area of ~1555 km 2 , most of which is intertidal, and much of which is dominated by marshes with small, dense, tidal drainages (Howard and Frey, 1985). Generally, the marshes of this expansive backbarrier area are veneers that overlie Pleistocene basement sediments (Basan and Frey, 1977;Frey and Basan, 1978). The Isle of Hope was created as part of the Princess Anne Shoreline Complex, indicated by ichnofacies to have formed when sea level was ~4 m above its current position, and these deposits reach a maximum elevation of approximately 9 m above modern sea level (Hoyt and Hails, 1967) (Fig. 3c). They are part of the Chatham Shoreline Sequence which includes the Pamlico, Princess Anne, and Silver Bluff Pleistocene deposits and the Holocene sea level sediments that lie to the east (Winker and Howard, 1977) (Fig. 3c). As indicated by this study, the modern salt marsh to the east of the Isle of Hope began accreting sediment during the late Holocene, initially covering the underlying Pleistocene sediments soon after sea level reached its approximate current level (2400 BP) and the modern transgression continued.  Meyer (2013); Hoyt (1969); Hoyt and Hails (1967)) "}, {"section_title": "Marsh Subenvironments and Sedimentation", "text": "Georgia's salt marshes occupy the upper extent of the intertidal zone, reaching as high as the mean high water spring tide, and they are the most common intertidal facies (Howard and Frey, 1985) (Fig. 4). This upper marsh boundary normally transitions into mainland environments or Pleistocene/Holocene barrier island remnants (Howard and Frey, 1980). The lower boundary of these marshes is usually an abrupt transition to a tidal stream bank (Howard and Frey, 1980). Within Georgia's salt marshes, low-marsh and high marsh areas are distinct sub-environments (Edwards and Frey, 1977), and the threshold between the two subenvironments lies around mean higher high water (Howard and Frey, 1980).  Edwards and Frey, 1977) While the transition from muddy low marsh to sandier high marsh is striking, several other smaller scale zones are discernible (Howard and Frey, 1985) (Fig. 4). The steeply sloping tidal stream banks that abut the low marsh, and they are capped by levees, behind which lies the low marsh, analogous to fluvial floodplains (Frey and Howard, 1980). While sedimentary texture gradients show that there are nearly constant equal proportions of silt and clay throughout the marsh environment (Edwards and Frey, 1977), the sandy component of marsh sediment is more variable in concentration, becoming much more important in the transitional and high marsh (Howard and Frey, 1985). Quartz sand dominates the high marsh, with accessory mud, mica, and feldspar, all of which form discontinuous laminae in this setting (Edwards and Frey, 1980). Georgia's salt marshes are densely vegetated, especially by the salt marsh cordgrass Spartina alterniflora, the short form of which is characteristic of the high marsh, while the tall form of the grass dominates the low marsh (Howard and Frey, 1985) (Fig. 5). Higher elevation portions of the high marsh are vegetated primarily by Salicornia bigelovii (glasswort), Juncus roemarianus (marsh rush), and the sampshires (Salicornia europaea, Salicornia virginica) (Howard and Frey, 1980). The bivalve mollusk Geukensia demissa and the gastropod Littorina littorea (common periwinkle) are ubiquitous to both the high and low marsh, and the oyster Crassostrea virginica is commonly found in the tidal creek banks below the levee marsh (Howard and Frey, 1980). Marsh fiddler crabs, Uca pugnax are also present in high concentrations in Georgia's salt marshes. The plant and animal populations of the Georgia salt marsh almost completely destroy any small scale sedimentary stratification (i.e., laminations) via bioturbation, and, although biogenic sedimentary structures are present throughout the marsh sub-environments, the high rate of bioturbation often obscures individual burrows (Edwards and Frey, 1980). The rates of sedimentation on the marsh surface are highly variable seasonally, annually, and environmentally (Letzsch and Frey, 1980), with the mean rate of sedimentation increasing from the high marsh to the tidal stream-side levees (Howard and Frey, 1985). The fact that the high marsh environs are only inundated by the highest tides causes a low rate of accretion by suspended fine sediments (Frey and Basan, 1978). Most of the sands and some of the fines deposited on the marsh surfaces are derived from erosion of local Pleistocene and Holocene barrier island sediments, while a portion of the fines are derived from fluviatile and offshore sources (Howard and Frey, 1980). Another substantial component of the mud content within the marsh also originates as fecal pellets and pseudofeces, rather than as flocculated clastic material, generated by suspension feeders like G. demissa (Howard and Frey, 1980), which also require vegetation and inundation."}, {"section_title": "History of Wormsloe and Jones Narrows Salt Marsh", "text": "The first English colonist to settle on the Isle of Hope was Noble Jones, a Physician from Surrey, England, who was granted permission by the Trustees of Georgia to occupy the 822 acre plot and create Wormsloe Plantation in 1736. His ancestors have remained in constant ownership of some part of Wormsloe to this day, later under the surnames of DeRenne and Barrow. At the time of Jones' initial grant to the land, the tidal stream Jones Creek, which runs along the eastern margin of Wormsloe, functioned as the back door navigational avenue to Savannah for anyone who wished to approach the city more discreetly from the sea than was possible via Wassaw Sound or the mouth of the Savannah River itself. For this reason, Jones built a tabby fortification at the southern end of Wormsloe, which still stands today, along with garrison huts for the detachment of marines sent by the English to help repel Spanish soldiers and vessels approaching from the south (Swanson, 2012). At the time of Noble Jones' arrival at the Isle of Hope, Wormsloe was covered by live oak hammocks, mixed pine forest, and some magnolia trees, with an understory featuring saw palmetto, scrub palmetto, and gallberry, with cabbage palm and bald cypress on the marsh margins. Wormsloe today still features much of the same vegetation, which has been modified to form its characteristic live oak-lined entrance road ( Fig. 6). Until the time of slave emancipation, sea island cotton was grown at Wormsloe, along with corn. In addition to the biota noted above, the marsh also supports mullet, black drum, sheepshead, catfish, jackfish, marsh hens, osprey, and herons (Swanson, 2012). Sarah Ross. WIEH facilitates and promotes the preservation of Wormsloe through interdisciplinary academic study."}, {"section_title": "Anthropogenic Impacts", "text": "Aside from the impacts upon the marsh due to the operations of Wormsloe Plantation, ongoing anthropogenic activity has affected the marsh in ways that are still visible today. An earthen causeway or dam was constructed during the US Civil War, connecting Wormsloe to Long Island (Rice et al., 2005), the lineation of which is discernible in satellite imagery and in person. An earthen battery was also built along the southern tip of the isle during the war, which still stands several meters higher than the surrounding forest floor. Construction of the battery likely had little impact on the marsh, but the causeway has affected hydrology in the area, and it forms the northern boundary of the impacted area examined by this study (Fig. 7 and 8). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dredged the tidal stream known as Skidaway Narrows during the construction of the Intracoastal Waterway in 1910, which likely affected the tidal hydrology of the Jones Narrows marsh (Rice et al., 2005). By 1968, construction began on Diamond Causeway, a highway that runs past the southern tip of the Isle of Hope, connecting Skidaway Island to the mainland. Despite efforts to connect the tidal streams along the north side of the road, the causeway created a hydrologic barrier through its bisection of the marsh, isolating the Jones Narrows from flow coming from the south and east (Rice et al., 2005) (Fig. 7 and 8). The decreased drainage, stagnation, and evaporation of tidal flow that can still reach the upland areas created by the dredge sand has likely caused increased salinity of the sediment, limiting the ability of S. alterniflora, among other common biota, to survive on the flats (Pennings and Bertness, 2001). \nWhile the temporal spacing of the aerial imagery at the time of the deposition of the lens of dredge sand atop Jones Narrows marsh is not high enough to know the exact dates of deposition, based on the coverage shown in the 1968 CE and 1972 CE aerials, it is likely safe to assume that, at minimum, the depth of sand that currently exists atop the marsh was deposited within the span of 5 years. This would indicate a rate of deposition of at least 81.2 mm/year at Jones Narrows marsh due to the construction of Diamond Causeway, as opposed to the calculated natural rate of 3.2 mm/yr. The historical maps and aerial imagery also show that the that the causeway (aka \"dam\") constructed during the Civil War (Rice et al., 2005) potentially prevented the Diamond Causeway dredge sand from being transported north beyond its position. If not for the presence of the Civil War causeway, however, the dredge sand introduced to the marsh from the south could have possibly been allowed to pass northward through Jones Narrows without being so dramatically deposited on the marsh surface. An alternative scenario would hold that the absence of the Civil War causeway could have caused a greater extent of the marsh system to be impacted by the dredge fill placement. Tidal flow through the marsh, of course, had also been reduced by the re-routing of flow to Skidaway narrows by ~1910 CE, so the potential for the great volume of sand introduced to the marsh (~340,000 m 3 ) to have passed through without effectively blocking flow via sedimentation would have still been limited. The attempt to restore the tidal hydrology of Jones Narrows in the late 1980's CE (Rice et al., 2005) has, by and large, failed to do so, with only one section of one of the restoration channels extending southward from the Civil War causeway onto the affected portion of the marsh. While only 32 of the 101 acres of marsh covered by dredge sand were pushed out of the intertidal elevation range into the supratidal range, the prior impediments to tidal hydrology induced by the Civil War causeway and the Skidaway Narrows re-routing prevented the possibility of the affected area to survive the construction of Diamond Causeway. It is important to note that the anthropogenic effects on Jones Narrows not only include changes to sedimentation and hydrology, but also the intrinsically connected impacts on marsh vegetation. The measure of the marsh covered by dredge sand (101 acres) not only indicates the area of low/high marsh that was covered by a veneer of sand, but the number also roughly analogous to the area of marsh halophytic vegetation that was effectively removed, of which recovery has been limited. Rice et al., 2005, mention the possibility of future efforts to restore the natural marsh vegetation and hydrology, but any attempt to do so would have to include the removal of the entire depth of dredge sand, as well as the removal of the Civil War Causeway. This restoration effort would likely include collateral impacts to the surrounding non-impacted marsh systems in order to access the area, and a net environmental benefits analysis would be warranted to determine the overall benefit of the remedial effort. Even with these large scale efforts, the potential for effective restoration of the low/high marsh environments would still be impeded by the preferential tidal flow through Skidaway Narrows."}, {"section_title": "Vibracoring Methods", "text": "Vibracoring is a technique that allows for continuous sediment core retrieval, preserving the stratigraphy and sedimentology of the sample in context (Howard and Frey, 1975).

To fully advance the pipe into the subsurface, the point at which the vibrating rod is attached to the pipe must be raised several times and re-attached, as each interval of penetration is limited by the height at which the individuals advancing the pipe can reach. Once the core encounters refusal or the pipe is fully advanced, the pipe is plugged to create a vacuum and is extracted from the subsurface with a chain hoist or come-along. Penetration depth is highly dependent upon the sediment pore water saturation and lithology. The core location is described, GPS coordinates and elevation are recorded, and vibration-induced compaction of the core is measured. This compaction value is determined by subtracting the depth to sediment within the core pipe from the depth to ground surface outside of the core pipe, prior to extraction. Once extracted, any loss of sediment from the bottom of the pipe is measured. The pipe is then trimmed of any excess empty length at the top of the core with a saw, and it is then cut into three sections of roughly equal length to ease transport. Each subsection of the core is labeled with respect to core location and directional relation to ground surface. The open ends of the core subsections are capped with plastic caps and/or duct tape to prevent loss of material. \nX-Ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry is an analytical technique that is used to assess the elemental presence and abundance within a sample material. X-ray emissions are caused by the photoelectric effect, and a given x-ray source can cause the ejection of an electron from the inner shells of atoms within a sample. The source can be either a radioisotope source or an X-ray tube which emits radiation that impacts the sample material. After the interaction of radiation with the atoms in the sample, electrons will be ejected from the inner electron shells, while electrons from the outer shell will fill the fill the empty inner shell void, emitting x-ray radiation characteristic of a given atom (Thomsen and Schatzlein, 2002). All of the elements in the given sample will generate a spectrum of x-rays, with each element generating several characteristic lines (Kalnicky and Singhvi, 2001). These lines are referred to as K-lines if caused by K-shell electrons or L-lines if emitted by L-shell electrons. These energies can be used to identify the elements and their concentrations within a given sample (Thomsen and Schatzlein, 2002). Field-portable X-ray fluorescence (FPXRF) analyzers usually utilize energy dispersion for the separation of X-ray lines rather than the alternative wavelength dispersion. XRF units utilize X-ray detectors to convert the X-ray photon energies into quantifiable voltage pulses. There are several types of common detectors, and FPXRF units usually utilize solid state semiconductor detectors instead of gas flow proportional detectors or scintillation detectors, both of which offer reduced resolution, relative to the solid state detectors (Kalnicky and Singhvi, 2001).\nOnce selected and removed from the core sediments, the samples were rinsed with deinonized water to remove attached sediment, and then oven dried in the lab at GSU at 100 \u00b0C degrees for up to 8 hours. The samples were then placed into small plastic bottles for shipment to the Center for Applied Isotope Studies (CAIS) at the University of Georgia for analysis. At the CAIS, the samples were chemically washed, dried, and subjected to accelerator mass spectrometry analysis to measure graphite 14C/13C ratios using the CAIS 0.5MeV accelerator mass spectrometer. The ratios of 13C/12C in the samples were measured with a stable isotope mass spectrometer and expressed as \u03b413C with respect to Pee Dee Belemnite. Uncalibrated dates for the samples were given in radiocarbon years before 1950, with error quoted as one standard deviation reflecting statistical and experimental errors, and the dates were corrected for isotope fractionation. The results returned from CAIS were calibrated for atmospheric 14C variability using the online CALIB 7.1 software (Stuiver and Reimer, 1993) and the IntCal13 and Marine13 databases (Reimer et al., 2013). The data from radiocarbon analysis were used, together with lithostratigraphic data and facies interpretations, to evaluate the rate of late Holocene sedimentation on the paleomarsh surface, and thus, the rate of local sea level rise for the same period of time. In addition, the radiocarbon data were used in an attempt constrain the upper and lower bounds in years BP of natural marsh sedimentation at the site. Samples were selected from seemingly continuous low marsh deposits, from the underlying (assumed) Pleistocene deposits near the point of vibracore refusal, and from the veneer of dredge sands that lie atop the marsh deposits. In the terminology established by Engelhart and Horton, 2012, it is important to establish the relationship of the sediment from which samples are extracted with respect to underlying, incompressible material, e.g., pre-Holocene sands. Samples pulled from the immediate contact zone between marsh sediments and the basal sands are considered base of basal, and thus likely free of compaction, while basal samples lie within the sedimentary unit directly overlying the incompressible unit and are potentially compacted, while intercalated samples are pulled from organic sediment positioned in between two clastic layers and are likely compacted (Engelhart and Horton, 2012). All samples used in the current study, aside from the dredge sand shell sample, can be considered basal or base of basal. Also after Engelhart and Horton, 2012, the methodology for estimating relative sea level for a given sample is performed using the following equation: Where A i is the altitude of the sample i and RWL i is the reference water level of the sample, both expressed relative to the same tidal datum. For example, for low marsh samples in this study, the indicative range is the difference between mean high water and mean tidal level (~1.1m MHW -0.0 MTL; Ft. Pulaski tide gauge), and the reference water level is estimated by dividing that difference by two ((MHW-MTL)/2). After Shennan and Horton, 2002, additional error is calculated using the equation: E i = (e 1 2 + e 2 2 + e n 2 ) \u00bd in which each additional source of error is represented as e 1 ...e n . These additional error sources account for altitudinal errors (survey errors), benchmark errors, sampling errors, borehole angle, and thickness of sample (Engelhart and Horton, 2012) (Table 1). The results of this error calculation for each sample are combined with the indicative range to arrive at the total RSL error. \nHistorical maps, aerial imagery, and satellite imagery were used as sources for spatial analysis of the study area, with specific attention to the area and volume of the lens of dredge sand that covers portions of the marsh after the construction of Diamond Causeway. The historical maps were used to assess the evolution of the landscape between the late 18th century and 2015. The database of imagery used for these analyses were provided by Dr. Tommy Jordan at the University of Georgia Center for Geospatial Research. The imagery were georectified using ground control points (GCPs) collected in the field with a Trimble GPS unit. Shapefiles were generated to quantify the impacted areas and the transformation of subenvironments after the deposition of the Diamond Causeway dredge material. At the time of the deposition of the dredge sand atop the marsh, several salt marsh sub-environments occurred at the surface within the study area. Analysis of the shapefiles reveals the total area covered by the dredge sand between the original time of deposition and present day. Additionally, the present volume of the sand lens was estimated via a combined analysis of the satellite and aerial imagery, along with the sedimentary logs of the Vibracore data. The extent of the fill placement was estimated using the 2012 satellite imagery, and LiDAR digital elevation model (DEM) was used for the present surface elevation values. The Vibracore data provided the average elevation of the former, pre-dredge sand cover, marsh. In ArcMap 10.4, the 3D Analyst Volume Fill function was used to approximate the volume."}, {"section_title": "Data Processing", "text": "Once transported to the lab at Georgia State University, the core pipes were split in half lengthwise and prepared for description and photography ( Fig. 9c and 9d). To cut each core section cleanly in half, each section is placed individually into a wooden core cutting box that allows for safer cutting. A hand-held circular saw is placed atop the cutting box, which only permits the blade of the saw through. This method prevents sediment and aluminum pipe cuttings from flying into the air. The saw blade is run along the length of the pipe, and then the core is rotated 180 degrees. The saw is run again along the length of the pipe to complete the cut from the other side. With the two halves of the pipe still held together by hand, the core is removed from the cutting box and placed onto a core rack designed to hold lengths of core. The core section is then carefully pulled apart into halves, with careful attention to ensure that the sediment is cleanly split. Once separated into halves, the core sediment is cleaned for photography with a trowel or other bladed hand tool. One half of the core is wrapped in clear plastic wrap for archiving, and the other half is prepared for photography. The half chosen for photography is labeled at a 10 cm interval along one edge of the pipe. High-resolution photographs are taken of the core samples, which are set into a wooden photography stand for the process. The photo stand allows for constant camera height and angle. Each core requires several photographs in order to capture to entire core length. The core is advanced through the photo stand and photographed at an interval of roughly 0.5 meters. The series of photos that comprise the complete core are merged and aligned in Adobe Photoshop in order to create one complete image. Sedimentary core logs are then created, describing sediment type, bedding and laminations, sedimentary structures, biogenic features, color, and more for each core. These logs are written out by hand, at first, as the core sediments are analyzed. Along with the written descriptions of the sediment, a hand drawn graphic log is created and inscribed alongside the descriptions, with different symbology used for the variety of lithologies and features present. Once the descriptive stage is completed, depositional environment interpretations are made based upon the facies descriptions. After the hand drawn logs are completed, a digital version is created which includes the high-resolution photographs of the cores in addition to the descriptions, environmental associations, and graphic lithologic logs ( Fig. 10 and 11). The depth of each core is corrected for field observed compaction in order to provide accurate elevations for radiocarbon samples and for cross-section representations. For the current study, total of 8 vibracores were extracted, with 6 extracted from the sand-flat covered section of Jones Narrows marsh and 2 extracted from the terrestrially vegetated southeastern edge of the Isle of Hope.

The unit is capable of detecting elements with atomic numbers 15 (phosphorus) through 92 (uranium), with the ability to measure concentrations from ppm to 100 percent. The unit's excitation source is an X-ray tube with a W anode (10-40 kV, 5-50 uA), and the detector is As, Se, Ba, Co, Zr, and Rb. Run in Sequential Testing mode, the FPXRF performs the Standard Test followed by the LEAP Test. The maximum testing time for each analysis was set at 60 seconds, which was the End Condition for each test. Prior to each session of analysis, a standardization plate was affixed to the analyzer and a standardization analysis was run.

The exported table provides analysis date, reading numbers, testing mode, live time of test, standardization pass/fail info, elemental abundance values (ppm), and error values. Elements with insufficient abundance for analysis read as <LOD, meaning the abundance of the given element was less than the Limit of Detection. Error for each reading are listed in the XRF Results tables in Appendix B. The bulk geochemistry values provided by the FPXRF analyses were then compared to the lithologic logs, photographic logs, and lithological descriptions in order to facilitate a chemostratigraphic study. Chemologs were created, displaying the lithologic and photographic data alongside the elemental data log plots, which show variation in abundance with depth. It has been established that the environmental evolution of a landscape and information on the formation of a given sedimentary deposit can be gleaned from the geochemical signatures of the sediment, and, through chemostratigraphic study, the sedimentary sequence can be divided into geochemically distinct units (Montero-Serrano et al., 2010). The XRF data set was run through a matrix of intercorrelation program on Vassarstats.net to determine which elemental associations exist in all of the samples, with respect to all of those elements detected above LOD in every sample, plus sulfur. The data set was then broken down into descriptive lithological subsections, namely sands, muds, and shell lag deposits, and each lithologic subsection was then subjected to the same matrix of intercorrelation analysis.

Together with the interpreted marsh subenvironmental deposits, gleaned from the vibracore lithostratigraphic data, radiocarbon data from organic material extracted from the cores were used to evaluate the relationship between the age of the deposited sediments and MSL elevation.

The 1780 and 1816 maps, while rather crude when compared to maps for the site from the later 19th century and early 20th century, do at least indicate that the boundaries of the upland Isle and the adjacent salt marsh were roughly in the same locations as they were at the time of the initial construction of Diamond Causeway. The locations of Bethesda orphanage and the residence/fortifications on Wormsloe plantation are also indicated, and appear to be reasonably accurate in their geographic representation. The most noticeable improvement in the maps, starting with the 1867 T-Sheet, is the greater detail in the representation of the marsh and tidal channels. Generally, the quality of the maps improves with time, and, due to their agreement with the earliest aerial images used by this study (1951), the maps from the early 20th century are assumed to portray tidal stream locations with moderate precision. The connective tidal channel that once ran through the study area is variably referred to in the historical maps as Jones Narrows (1867T-Sheet, 1935T-Sheet, 1938T-Sheet, 1944T-Sheet, 1957Topo, 1988Topo), Lones Narrows Creek (1912Topo, 1945, and the Isle of Hope River (1933 T-Sheet). For consistency, Jones Narrows was chosen as the only title by which the stream is referenced within the current study. The earthen causeway (aka dam) that runs across the marsh from the Isle of Hope to Long Island, initially shown on the 1908 map ( Fig. 16), appears to be the earliest substantial 19th century anthropogenic impact to the marsh shown on the maps, having been built during the Civil War but not represented on any of the 19th century maps (Rice et al., 2005). The 1960 property map displays and refers to the feature as simply \"old dam.\" The residual effects of the dam as a hydrologic and sedimentologic barrier are visible from the 1951 aerial imagery onward, through the time of this study. The dam seems to potentially represent a northern barrier for migration of the dredged sandy material deposited during the construction of Diamond Causeway, an effect first captured by the 1968 aerial imagery (Fig. 17). The 1968 aerial shows an accumulation of a material with a high albedo (sand) atop the marsh, in addition to the visible beginnings of the construction of Diamond Causeway to the west of the Isle of Hope and the clearing of the causeway path to the south and east of the Isle of Hope. The dates of construction indicated by the aerials do not agree with the statement in Rice et al., 2005, that Diamond Causeway was constructed in 1972, although this may be the year of the completion of the entire construction project. The construction of the section of Diamond Causeway that lies adjacent to the Isle of Hope appears to be complete by the time of the 1971 aerial imagery (28 December 1971) (Fig. 18).   17: Study area -1968 aerial imagery;inset 1999 CIR imagery (courtesy UGA CGR) By the time of the 1951 aerial photograph, the width of the main Jones Narrows channel at Transect A is ~4 meters. The main channel reach is barely visible in the 1956 aerial, and the channel appears to terminate north of Transect A by the time of the 1961 aerial. In the 1968 aerial, the scars of the main channel are visible, but the tidal flow appears to terminate at the Civil War dam, 250 meters north of Transect A, at which point its width is ~6 m. This same Figure 18: Study area mid Diamond Causeway construction -1971 aerial imagery;inset 1999 CIR imagery (courtesy UGA CGR) channel termination is visible in the 1971 aerial and all subsequent aerials, although, beginning with the 1988 aerial, there are linear drainages or channels connecting the tidal channels north of the dam to a series of channels that run adjacent to the southern tip of the Isle of Hope, eventually feeding into Moon River (Fig. 19). These channels are the products of an attempt to restore tidal connectivity through the marsh to Moon River (Rice et al., 2005). The channels are still present at the time of the current study, although their connectivity through the study area portion of the marsh is limited, with tidal flow from Jones Narrows extending only ~60 m south of the Civil War dam, still ~90 m north of Transect A. While the E-W running section of the man-made channel, which runs to the south of the Isle of Hope and parallel to Diamond Causeway, still appears to be hydrologically active at the time of the 2012 satellite imagery, all of the NW-SE components of the channel network are dry. The scars of these channels, which cross Transect A at several points, are made visible in the aerial and satellite imagery by parallel vegetated upland hammocks. The channels are also characterized by the lack of once-present dredge sand in their vicinity. They appear to have acted to reduce the volume of dredge sand beginning sometime before 1988, although the reduction in dredge sand cover surrounding the channels appears to have ceased or slowed dramatically by 1999, as the area of dredge sand cover has remained constant from the 1999 imagery through the present.

All five of the cores were extracted from marsh surface that is currently or has been covered by the veneer of dredge sand imparted by the Diamond Causeway construction. All vibracore depth values in the following results sections are reported as compacted values, unless noted. Three of the cores in this transect reached maximum (compaction corrected) potential pipe penetration below land surface of 5.5m, and two of the five (WM050215-03 and WM050215-04) penetrated a densely compacted bioturbated gray/green muddy fine sand interval at ~5m BLS. This interval of sediment, in both cases, abruptly transitions into muddy fine sand above, with discontinuous mud lenses and multiple burrows present. The dense bioturbated muddy fine sand layer conforms with the \"laminated\" assumed Pleistocene facies described by Howard and Scott, 1983, which they interpret to be analogous to foreshore deposits. These deposits within the cores extracted for the current study are overprinted by intense mottling and terrestrial biofacies burrows. In WM050215-03, the foreshore deposit is capped by what may be a paleosol, indicating consistent terrestrial sub-aerial exposure prior to the subsequent deposition of the overlying Holocene marsh mud. In WM050215-04, the \"laminated\" facies is capped by a thin (5cm) bioturbated interval of charcoal material (460-465 cm BLS), again indicating sub-aerial exposure prior to the Holocene marsh mud deposition. The three easternmost cores of Transect 1 penetrated a shell rich facies indicative of a tidal creek or creek bank depositional environments at ~3-4.5m BLS (Fig. 13).

Cluster A 3 also contains 100% of both the high marsh interpreted deposits (2 of 2) and the Pleistocene \"forebeach\" sand deposits (5 of 5), as well as 86% (6 of 7) of the dredge sand deposits. Core WM050215-04 best responded to the 5 cluster treatment, and its clusters are labeled A 4 , B 4 , C 4 , D 4 , and E 4 ( Fig. 22). Despite the higher number of clusters, the 48 readings are spread more evenly between the clusters in WM050215-04, with 15 in Cluster E 4 , 14 in A 4 , 12 in B 4 , 4 in D 4 , and 3 in C 4 . Cluster E 4 is dominantly composed of mud rich intervals, with the only other lithology present in the cluster being the entirety of the muddy sand facies intervals (4 of 4) interpreted to be the Pleistocene \"forebeach\" deposits from the base of the core. Cluster A 4 is sandier, containing 4 of the 5 total dredge sand intervals from the core, in addition to the majority of the high marsh sandy mud deposits. Cluster B 4 features nearly an even split between low marsh muds and high marsh sandy muds (6 to 5), with one dredge fill deposit interval present. Clusters C 4 and D 4 contain 100% (7 of 7) of the tidal creek shell-rich deposit intervals within the core, which make up the entirety of both clusters.\nMeyer, 2013, found that cluster analysis was successful at grouping barrier island system facies into meaningful groups, but stated that the separation of sediments into depositional subenvironments is dependent upon the recognition of primary physical and biogenic structures and could be difficult to achieve via cluster analysis, alone. The current study attempted to assess the ability of cluster analysis of XRF data to separate the analyzed sediment into salt marsh depositional subenvironments. The analysis proved able to isolate intervals that correspond to tidal creek deposits more readily than any other subenvironmental intervals. These intervals, in both WM050215-03 and WM050215-04, were grouped into clusters distinct from those clusters immediately above and below. Furthermore, unique clusters identified the aforementioned peaks in Ca and Sr, which also correspond with dips in the concentrations of Ti and Zr. While the peaks and dips in the concentrations would be evident in the analysis of the raw XRF data, the clusters also quickly divided these intervals into stratigraphically unique groups. Within WM050215-03, most of the cluster separation appears to correspond with the same Ca-Sr/Ti-Zr relationship, with Cluster A 3 indicating very low Ca-Sr/Ti-Zr values, cluster B 3 indicating moderate Ca-Sr/Ti-Zr ratios, and cluster C 3 indicating high Ca-Sr/Ti-Zr ratios. The increase in Ca and Sr relative to Ti and Zr in the tidal creek intervals is most likely caused by the tendency of these intervals to contain much more calcareous shell material, the source of both Ca and Sr, and correspondingly less heavy mineral sands from washover deposits, which would be expected to be limited to high marsh environments. Potentially significant within the same core (WM050215-03) is the low Fe concentration within Cluster C 3 , although Fe concentration does not appear to correspond as strongly with cluster division as does the Ca-Sr/Ti-Zr ratio. The same Ca-Sr/Ti-Zr ratios present in the WM050215-03 clusters carry over to WM050215-04, as well. Alternatively, Clusters D 4 and C 4 from WM050215-04 correspond exclusively with the tidal creek interval within the core. Cluster E 4 is continuous from the base of the tidal creek deposits to the base of the core, identified as a low marsh deposit interval, and features a consistently low Ca-Sr/Ti-Zr-Fe ratio. The low marsh deposits above the tidal creek interval of Clusters D 4 and C 4 are consistently sandier than the cluster E 4 deposits and feature a slightly higher Ca-Sr/Ti-Zr-Fe ratio, possibly due to greater lateral proximity of the marsh surface to the tidal creek at the time of deposition. This trend could also potentially indicate the capability of XRF cluster analysis to identify older and muddier deposits within salt marsh basins if this geochemical trend can be shown to be common, and while a similar interval in WM050215-03 was not separated into its own cluster, it was shorter and displayed relatively lower corresponding Zr values than the those in Cluster E 4 . Core WM050215-03 lies ~75 meters to the west of WM050215-04, which could be the source of a decreased influence from storm    (Fig. 23 and 24). The younger sample from Interval A, WM26, falls cleanly within the bound of the St. Catherine's sea level envelope, however, the older sample, WM25, even with its altitudinal error and indicative range taken into account, falls just outside of the lower limits of the envelope. This section of the envelope falls within a \"data gap\" in the St. Catherine's reconstruction which could potentially be one explanation for the lack of agreement, while local variability in tectonics and subsidence could also be the cause, as St. Catherine's Island is 25 miles SE of The Isle of Hope. Interval B (1753 CE \u00b1 32 to 1968 CE), which indicates 3.2 mm/year of RSL rise, falls within the St. Catherine's RSL envelope. The NOAA tide gauge record at Ft. Pulaski reports the history of local SLR for the Savannah, Ga, area since 1935 CE, and the gauge is located 10 miles NE Jones Narrows marsh. A mean sea level trend has been calculated from the monthly mean sea level for Ft. Pulaski, which indicates 3.17 +/-0.28 mm/year of RSL rise from 1935 CE to 2015 (Fig. 23). This rate conforms well with and continues the trend of the rate of RSL rise indicated by the current study (Fig. 23)   Also examined by Meyer, 2013, the study by Depratter and Howard, 1981, reconstructed late Holocene RSL via archaeological investigations on the Georgia and South Carolina coasts. Intervals A and B of the current study conform well with the RSL curve proposed by Depratter and Howard, 1981, with their reconstruction indicating roughly the same rates of SLR and depths that align with the higher reaches of the indicative range and altitudinal error in intervals A and B. The validity of their reconstruction, based on archaeological features, was called into question by Belknap and Hine, 1983, who stated that the indicative meaning derived from archaeological data is invalid due to its dependence upon the interpretation of human behavior. This point was reiterated by Hawkes et al., 2016, however, the assumptions made of human behavior that underpin the study in Depratter and Howard, 1981, are the same that guide and validate many archaeological investigations and seem little different from the assumptions made of sedimentary processes involved in the most basic stratigraphic investigations. Colquhoun and Brooks, 1986, reconstructed RSL on the South Carolina coast for a period partially concurrent with the reconstruction from the current study, indicating moderate conformity between the two reconstructions from ~600 CE forward. The Colquhoun and Brooks, 1986, RSL curve also falls within the bounds of Meyer's RSL envelope for the period covered by the current study (~1000 CE to ~1968 CE). Engelhart and Horton, 2012, compiled a database of late Holocene RSL for the United States Atlantic coast based upon salt marsh index points, indicating that RSL rise from 8 to 4 ka BP ranges from 0.5 to 4.5 mm/yr, while the rate from 4 ka BP to 1900 CE ranges from 0.6 to 1.8 mm/yr, a decreased rate of RSL rise thought to be caused by a relaxation of GIA and northern hemisphere ice sheet minimums during the ~7-8 ka period. The furthest south that the database extended at the time of publication was to southern South Carolina, where the authors state that the rate of RSL rise for the past 4 ka was found to be constant, although only one index point from the southern South Carolina data set was dated to less than ~1.8 ka. The index points in the database for northern South Carolina indicate a rate of rise of ~0.8 mm/yr from 4 ka BP to 1900 CE, although the youngest index point in this data set dates to 2 ka. The data from Engelhart and Horton, 2012, also show a decrease in rate of RSL rise during the Holocene in the southern North Atlantic that the authors ascribe to greater distance from the Laurentide Ice Sheet and its forebulge. The discrepancies in the RSL rates of rise calculated from the current study for the periods from 1017-1753 CE (2.1 mm/year) and 1753-1968 CE (3.2 mm/year) versus those indicated by the Atlantic RSL database for the southern North Atlantic could be due to the fact that periods of time covered by the two studies have only ~500 years of overlap, which coincide with the earliest ~500 years covered by the current study, prior to the Anthropocene acceleration of SLR. The index point at ~1753 CE allows the interval B rate to avoid the assumption of constant RSL rise for the past 1 ka, and provides for the differentiation of the pre-and post-18 th century rates of RSL rise. Kemp et al., 2014, added a salt marsh RSL construction for NE Florida to the US Atlantic RSL database based upon salt marsh core radiocarbon dates and anthropogenic chemical chronohorizons, and the data from the cores was fused with tide gauge data from Fernandina Beach, Florida. This reconstruction of late Holocene RSL indicates a mean subsidence rate of ~0.41 mm/year from 590 BCE to 2010 CE, with the Fernandina Beach tide gauge measuring 1.9 \u00b1 0.3 mm/year of RSL rise from 1900 CE to 2012 CE (Kemp et at., 2014). However, according to the authors, a GPS station 5.5 km from the Fernandina Beach tide gauge measured subsidence of 3.58 \u00b1 0.30 mm/year, a value deemed anomalous by the authors due to its disagreement with the RSL rates from Miami Beach, Charleston, and Key West, locations that are up to ~420 miles from Fernandina. It should be noted that Fernandina Beach is ~90 miles to the SW of the Isle of Hope, and this discrepancy in subsidence rates could be due to local tectonic sags and/or subsidence in the areas showing increased rates of RSL rise. Also, Brain et al., 2014, found that, specifically within peat marshes like those utilized by Kemp et al., 2014, for their reconstruction, autocompaction can dramatically reduce the apparent rate of RSL rise. The rate of RSL indicated by the current study for interval B (3.2 mm/year) is higher than the rates proposed by Kemp et al., 2014, the mean rate indicated by the Fernandina Beach tide gauge, and the South Carolina RSL values from the Atlantic Database (Engelhart and Horton, 2012). If corrected for the maximum potential effects of autocompaction (0.07 mm/yr) (Brain et al., 2014), the SLR rates at Jones Narrows are still markedly higher. However, the Anthropocene rate of SLR indicated by the more proximal Ft. Pulaski tide gauge is correspondingly higher (3.17 mm/year), again, potentially indicating the effect of local tectonics on the reconstructed late Holocene RSL rate at Jones Narrows marsh. The Jones Narrows RSL reconstruction shows that, in agreement with the most recent updates to the North Atlantic US Late Holocene RSL database, an increase over the background Late Holocene rate of RSL rise occurs during the Anthropocene, and the contribution to RSL rise from global climate change can potentially be evaluated by incorporating the background rates of subsidence due to GIA from the total rate of rise in the Anthropocene."}, {"section_title": "Radiocarbon Data", "text": "One radiocarbon sample composed of charcoal was extracted and submitted from the dense muddy fine sand at the base (500cm BLS) of WM050215-03 (Sample WM08; AMS 14C = 48,220 +/-480 B.P.), while three radiocarbon samples were extracted and submitted from WM050215-02 (WM03; AMS 14C = 33,710 +/-120 B.P.; WM25; 1000 +/-25 B.P.; WM26; 160 +/-25 B.P.)

As indicated by data from the same core, the calculated rate of sedimentation and RSL rise from 1769 CE to ~1968 CE (Interval B) is 3.2 mm/year. If the assumption is made that the same rate of sedimentation applies to the marsh deposits that extend from radiocarbon sample WM25 to the base of the core, which terminates directly above the cross section estimate of the laterally extending Pleistocene basement sand, then the time of initial marsh deposition and tidal inundation of the basement sands can be approximated at ~220 BCE, shortly after the onset of the modern transgression at 2400 BP (Meyer, 2013). "}, {"section_title": "Dredge Sand Area and Volume", "text": "Analysis of the aerial and satellite imagery from the 1951 aerial onward assessed the area and volume covered by the dredge sand in addition to quantifying the modifications to the marsh and Isle geomorphology. The total area covered initially by the dredge sand, per the 1971 aerial, is roughly 100 acres (over 400,000 m 2 ). Some of the area initially covered by the sand (~32 acres) was eventually incorporated into the upland supratidal environments of the Isle of Hope and Long Island, becoming covered by the same terrestrial vegetation. The eventual addition to the Isle of Hope covers ~16 acres (~64,750 m 2 ), and the sum area of the two extensions added to Long Island is ~10 acres (~40,000 m 2 ) (Fig. 20). The remaining ~68 acres (~275,000 m 2 ) of dredge covered area was raised enough in elevation to enter either the high marsh range of the tidal frame or the sandflat/saltpan range. Of the area covered by dredge sand and converted to a different environmental regime, the vast majority was low marsh prior to the Causeway construction, based upon the vibracore data from the current study. Using the 3D Analyst Volume Fill tool in ArcMap, the volume of the present dredge sand lens was estimated. The LiDAR DEM provided the surface below which the average depth of the sand lenses as measured from the vibracore data provided the height of the volume. An average elevation (corrected for compaction) of 40.61 cm was used to represent the former marsh surface and used to estimate the volume of fill placement. The modern sand lens is estimated to be ~12.1 million ft 3 or ~450,000 yd 3 . This volume estimate is most likely a conservative estimate as the volume of material placed into the tidal creeks would be extremely variable in nature. "}, {"section_title": "Jones Narrows Stratigraphy", "text": "Vibracoring proved to be an efficient method of obtaining the samples in the intertidal marsh setting. The sediment recovered in the two days of fieldwork required for the extraction of the cores has provided more than adequate data for examination in the current study. The crosssections created from the lithologic data revealed by the vibracoring illustrate the vertical and lateral variation of deposits within the marsh and provide the basis for the RSL change estimates, chemostratigraphic investigations, and the evaluation of the anthropogenic impacts. Specifically, the vibracore data reveal the vertical extent of anthropogenic dredge sand impacts (mean depth 40 cm, corrected for compaction). The stratigraphy of the marsh shows, via the reconstructed tidal creek intervals, that for much of the late Holocene, tidal hydrology has been active enough through Jones Narrows to deposit shell lag. Additionally, the vibracore stratigraphy, along with the radiocarbon data, indicate that the depositional basin in which Jones Narrows marsh resides is framed and underlain by Pleistocene foreshore sands that comprise the cores of The Isle of Hope and Long Island. The similarity between the Pleistocene basal sands from the current study and the Pleistocene \"foreshore\" sand identified by Howard and Scott, 1983, reinforce this stratigraphic framework. Again, in concert with the radiocarbon samples age ranges, the vibracore data demonstrate that the Jones Narrows marsh sediments and intertidal system were created under continuous sedimentation during the ensuing late Holocene transgression."}, {"section_title": "Chemostratigraphy", "text": "The XRF chemostratigraphy provided insights in to the nature of sedimentation at Jones Narrows. The most striking patterns visible in the chemostratigraphy of the samples are the Ca and Sr peaks coincident with the marine shell lag that is characteristic of the interpreted tidal creek deposits. Although marine tests are generally the main contributor to Ca concentration, it is important to note that Ca can also indicate the presence of hornblende, epidote, and tourmaline (Meyer, 2013), potentially indicating metamorphic or igneous provenance of the detrital sediment. Additionally, the ratio of Sr/Ca in these shells can be applied as a proxy for high resolution daily light cycle reconstruction for the paleoenvironment, although the current study was not carried out at the appropriate scale or resolution for this application (Sano et al., 2012). The Sr/Na concentrations in molluscan shells can indicate levels of paleosalinity (Findlater et al., 2014), however, these analyses also exceed the scope and capabilities of the current study. Sandy mud deposits with some marine shells and plant macrofossils are positioned above what is interpreted to be the Pleistocene island core at the base of each XRF vibracore section. These deposits are interpreted to be low marsh or tidal creek levee deposits, and they display distinct relatively high Fe, Ti, and K concentrations. Ti concentration is likely controlled by the presence of ilmenite, leucoxene, and rutile, while the Fe concentration is most likely associated with almandine, hornblende, epidote, tourmaline, and staurolite (Meyer, 2013). These concentrations potentially indicate a greater influence from HMS-rich washover fans on this subenvironment during this interval or variation in the nature of sediment load in the terrestrial fluvial source feeding into the marsh from the west. Changes in sediment supply source could imply large scale environmental change or fluvial dynamism, both of which could potentially be correlated with sediment deposition evidence in other coastal study areas. The increase in the concentration of this trio of elements (Fe, Ti, K), along with characteristic lithology, could potentially be used to identify the onset of sedimentation after the inundation of Pleistocene island cores in surrounding barrier island Holocene marsh settings, if shown to be a common facies. In the matrices of intercorrelation, the strong correlations seen between Fe, Mn, Ti and Zr in the sandy facies intervals are likely due to the influence of HMS transported from proximal beach deposits. Within the muddy facies interval, it was expected that there would be a very strong correlation between Fe and K, due to source clay mineralogy (Meyer, 2013), and there are very strong associations between these two elements within these samples. Meyer, 2013, also noted that the muddy chemofacies from St. Catherine's Island displayed strong correlations between Fe, Ca, and S, associated with the occurrence of calcareous shell material and secondary alteration to pyrite and/or marcasite due to subsurface marsh reducing conditions. These strong correlations do not appear within the Jones Narrows muddy facies XRF data, potentially because of the separation in this study of shell rich (tidal creek) facies from the general marsh muds during analysis; the absence of this correlation in the current study may also be due to the comparably small sample size or potential erroneous facies identification."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The purposes of this study were to evaluate the evaluate the sedimentary record of local Late Holocene SLR and to document and quantify the anthropogenic impacts to Jones Narrows salt marsh through the application of sedimentologic analyses, radiocarbon dating, XRF chemostratigraphy, and geospatial methods. The stratigraphic results reveal the continuous record, via vibracore Transects 1 and 2, of Holocene salt marsh deposition within the sedimentary basin that was created during the Late Pleistocene at Jones Narrows. The vibracore results also reveal more complete data concerning the vertical extent of the anthropogenically induced sedimentation on the marsh surface. These data, when examined in concert with the spatial analyses of the marsh based on historical maps and aerial imagery, effectively reveal new information concerning the scale and history of anthropogenic causes and effects on the hydrology, sedimentation, and vegetation cover within the marsh. The chemostratigraphic study of the vibracore sediments bares information on the nature of the deposition of several intervals of the Holocene marsh mud, tidal creek lag, and the dredge sand veneer; this study also provides insight into the nature of the Pleistocene basement sediments that underlie the Holocene marsh. The subsequent cluster analyses of the XRF chemologs indicate that the methods described by this study, with modification and repeated iterations, could prove to be effective tools for identifying or confirming salt marsh depositional subenvironments within sedimentary sequences. Lastly, the Late Holocene relative sea level reconstruction of Jones Narrows marsh, based upon the radiocarbon analyses of the marsh deposits and the indicative meaning of the sediments, helps to add data to an important research gap that exists for the Southeastern US Atlantic Coast. The rates of RSL rise indicated by this study for the late Holocene (2.1 mm/year) and Anthropocene (3.2 mm/year) agree with some other local reconstructions (Meyer, 2013;Depratter and Howard, 1981;Colquhoun and Brooks, 1983) and the Ft. Pulaski tide gauge data (NOAA), while revealing substantially higher SLR rates for the region during both periods than those rates indicated by several other North Atlantic salt marsh reconstructions (Engelhart and Horton, 2012;Kemp et al., 2014;Hawkes et al., 2016) and Earth-ice models (Argus et al., 2014). However, the results of the current study concur with most of these other studies by suggesting an increase in SLR rate for the Anthropocene as compared to the rest of the Late Holocene."}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Further Study", "text": "XRF analyses of other salt marshes and/or future studies at Jones Narrows would benefit from a higher resolution of XRF data collection within the upper 2 meters of sediment in order to be able to identify anthropogenic chemical chronohorizons (Kemp et al., 2014), which allows for more accurate age-depth models for the 19 th and 20 th centuries. Future vibracore investigations and Late Holocene RSL reconstructions of other salt marshes on the northern Georgia coast are also recommended, in order to further confirm or question the SLR rates indicated by the current study while also investigating the variable effects of local tectonics on the record of Late Holocene RSL. Lastly, investigations of salt marsh remediation efforts could improve and inform methods for reviving and restoring salt marshes impacted by large volumes of exotic sediment, as in the case of Jones Narrows marsh."}]
