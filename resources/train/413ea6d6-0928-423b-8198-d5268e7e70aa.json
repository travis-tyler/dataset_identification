In 1970, a landmark paper showed that hypertension was a strong risk factor for all types of stroke. 1 Thereafter, other major risk factors for stroke were identified. Subsequent studies showed that many risk factors can be reduced and that their control decreases the incidence of stroke. The late 1970s saw the first proof that aspirin prevents stroke. 2 This was followed by the introduction of other efficacious antiplatelet agents. The first modern comprehensive stroke unit was inaugurated in 1975, 3 and tissue plasminogen activator's effectiveness in acute stroke was demonstrated in 1995. 4 Carotid endarterectomy was shown to prevent stroke in selected patients and angioplasty and stenting are currently being tested for similar purposes. Coiling offers an alternative to brain aneurysm and arteriovenous malformation surgery. Brain imaging has revolutionalized the diagnosis of stroke and the management of patients with stroke. Steady progress enhances our understanding of the mechanisms of brain injury, repair, plasticity, and recovery. Each of the previous Editors-in-Chief of Stroke (Clark Millikan, Fletcher McDowell, Henry Barnett, Oscar Reinmuth, and Mark Dyken) summarized the main developments and issues in the field during their tenures, covering the years 1970 to 2000. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] The developments in subsequent years have been documented in the annual \"Advances\" feature of Stroke."}, {"section_title": "Paradoxes of Progress", "text": "Progress breeds paradoxes. Stroke is preventable yet is increasing globally. The same few major risk factors account for much of the leading health problems of the world but remain uncontrolled in the majority of affected individuals. Management of risk factors is the most readily applicable and affordable part of our knowledge, but prevention is neglected, and most environments are inhospitable to healthy living. Although many advances in the understanding of excitotox-icity, neurotransmitter depletion, oxidative stress, mitochondrial failure, inflammation, and apoptosis have occurred, this has been accomplished in relative isolation from the knowledge gained on the same mechanisms that underlie other major afflictions of the brain such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and brain trauma.\nAlthough the symptoms of stroke are well described, the majority at risk do not recognize their significance. In 1 study, only 1 in 6 individuals were aware that a treatment for stroke exists and that at the time of the study, it had to be given no more than 3 hours after symptom onset. 10 In stroke, we know that time is brain, but too few brains arrive in time. Although we have learned to treat transient ischemic attack as an emergency, only approximately 1 in 8 of patients with first-time stroke have a prior transient ischemic attack. 11 We must find other ways of identifying those at high risk for stroke. Subclinical (\"silent\") strokes are the most common type of stroke, executive function impairment being its earliest manifestation, but this fact is barely recognized and cognition seldom measured. 12 Stroke unit care improves outcomes of patients of all ages, stroke types, and severities but remains the exception rather than the rule in stroke care. The understanding of the neurobiology of brain injury, repair, and plasticity has advanced, but no histopro-tective or reparative drug has yet proved efficacious.\nStroke rehabilitation works but is largely unavailable for the time and intensity required. Effective drugs are not accessible or affordable in many developing countries nor used optimally in developed ones. Unproven, costly, or misdirected practices continue to drain resources and prevent the pursuit of more cost-effective approaches.\nAlthough the challenges are daunting, the achievements of the past 4 decades are inspiring, having witnessed the transformation of stroke from an area notable for diagnostic precision and therapeutic impotence to a field ripe for further advances in prevention, acute treatment, and rehabilitation."}, {"section_title": "Groups' Recommendations", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Basic Science, Drug Development, and Technology", "text": "Step 1: Address Unmet Needs-In all aspects of basic science, drug development, and technology, there is clearly a need to \"do things differently\" if there is to be a major advance in the development of new interventions. 13, 14 Over the last few years, there has been a dearth of advances that have limited genuine leaps in the understanding of the basic science and pathogenesis of stroke, and hence new targets for therapy. 15, 16 To counter this, a radical approach is suggested in the following areas."}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "text": "\n\n\n1.

Hypoxia-inducible factor-1a responses are conserved from flies to mammals. Can we build on these fundamentals for stroke? In horseshoe crabs (living fossils), coagulation and immune systems are merged.

The synergium should be broad enough that each mechanism can be examined in light of several diseases."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Major chronic diseases such as stroke, heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer disease and vascular cognitive impairment may be linked by common risk factors and pathophysiological mechanisms. Few simple steps like eating a balanced diet, exercising, maintaining optimal body weight, avoiding smoking, and limiting alcohol consumption can reduce risk of stroke by up to 80%. 21, 22 The occurrence of shared risk factors and possible common pathophysiological mechanisms (eg, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction) 23 provide a backdrop for the establishment of chronic disease prevention or health preservation networks.\nWe propose 3 steps to influence future stroke prevention. The approach includes novel means to enhance stroke prevention and integrate strategies from within and outside the medical field with an emphasis on synergistic opportunities and collaborations.\nThe establishment of stroke units and stroke centers has been the most significant contribution to the field of acute stroke management. Stroke units are an effective intervention for the vast majority of stroke victims. Stroke centers along with prehospital system organization, access to rehabilitation, and secondary prevention improve the quality of stroke care.\nEnormous lobbying to reach policymakers has been pivotal to all advances in the development of stroke care systems to date. Once \"stroke\" has reached political awareness, smooth implementation of care systems follows. The activities may be at the state or provincial level or even at the national level of countries such as Russia, Brazil, Spain, or the United Kingdom. The political will to improve stroke care will allow new activities in the field of stroke to be launched. Nation-or statewide documentation, standards, and quality control instruments can be implemented and more financial resources made available for the development of stroke management and prevention initiatives.\nThe role of physicians in initiating and guiding such developments is paramount. The achievements in the prehos-pital system in the United States and in the statewide stroke unit programs in Germany, Brazil, Spain, and Russia were only possible with the enormous input of stroke physicians. Large-scale application of the Scandinavian stroke unit model has increased access to thrombolytic therapy and reduced the case fatality rate leading to remarkable improvement in the quality of stroke care. 28 This should continue to be a major source of strength and direction.\nStroke care is expensive. It has to be supported in a zero-sum game of allocation in the setting of overall shrinking budgets of general health care, an action that will be not be warmly welcomed by colleagues in other fields. A helpful and key, evidence-supported message is that improvements in stroke care frequently brings net health expenditure savings to governments by reducing rehabilitation, nursing home, and lost productivity costs.\nAlthough capitalizing on existing therapies is well justified, flexibility has to be built into the system to facilitate the successful application of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. It should be possible to introduce new tools and technologies, revise protocols, and modify the composition of the stroke care team to fit the requirement of new developments in the field. By doing so, the stroke care system will remain flexible and will be amenable to incorporate advances that will continue to improve the care of the patient with stroke.\nMajor reductions in the burden of stroke can be achieved by providing better public education. In many parts of the world, access to reliable medical information and even electricity is limited. The electronic means to disseminate health information (eg, healthier lifestyle, risk factors, stroke symptoms, and emergency response) are available in industrialized countries, but less so in developing countries. There is a wide disparity in global internet penetration 46 according to geographic (Figure) and demographic characteristics with older individuals less likely to access electronic information. Adoption of universal technology standards and worldwide unrestricted access to data will in part define how these disparities can be addressed. In the developed world, with the advent of high-bandwidth wireless delivery systems, there will be few regions without Internet access provided that sufficient resources are invested. In those parts of the world where connectivity is more limited, different strategies for knowledge dissemination and behavior change will need to be adapted to the available communication means (eg, mobile phones, print, radio, television, word of mouth).\nInteractions among major stakeholders in the stroke field such as large stroke organizations, government agencies, nongovernmental organizations, industry, and patient organizations can be mutually beneficial. Integrated activities among these groups can enhance patient care, the development and implementation of new therapies, and the dissemination of new and existing information. The following sections describe the activities/contributions of these 5 sectors and also provide 3 concrete suggestions of how to enhance mutually beneficial activities over the next several years."}, {"section_title": "Step 1: Establish a Global Chronic Disease Prevention Initiative That Includes Stroke as a Major Focus Among a Cluster of Conditions-The Chronic Disease", "text": "Action Group has provided a call to action to encourage, support, and monitor activity on the implementation of evidence-based efforts to achieve global, regional, and national programs to prevent and control chronic diseases. 24 This group emphasizes the control of 3 key modifiable lifestyle risks: unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and tobacco habit. Multisectorial policies as well as long-term, sustainable action plans are encouraged to empower individuals, families, and communities to affect health-conscious behavioral change. The creation of the Global Noncommunicable Disease Network (NCDnet) 25 also focuses to reduce risk, morbidity, and mortality related to 4 risk factors (tobacco use, physical inactivity, unhealthy diets, and the harmful use of alcohol).

This is a specialized unit in the emergency room with a trained team to assist acute vascular disorders, including stroke, coronary syndromes, pulmonary embolism, and aortic diseases.\nStep 2: Development of Regional Systems of Emergency Stroke Care-Activating the prehospital emergency medical system and transportation to the designated stroke centers leads to a shorter delay in arrival at the hospital and better initial management. The training of ambulance teams and dispatchers in prehospital recognition of stroke as an emergency 34, 35 and the recognition of stroke signs increases the number of patients arriving earlier at hospital (eg, Greater Los Angeles). 36 Scientific statements recommend the development of regional systems of stroke care in which ambulances bring patients with acute stroke directly to stroke center hospitals to rapidly provide approved stroke therapies, improving the outcome of patients. 37 1.

Stroke awareness campaigns can increase symptom identification, thus resulting in a decrease in the time from symptom onset to hospital arrival and increase in the number of patients who may receive appropriate interventions.\nDevelop nodular models of comprehensive stroke care, rehabilitation, and prevention on the principle that some components are essential but that they need to be adapted in the community where they are to be implemented.

During the early days to weeks after a stroke, spontaneous repair events usually lead to some degree of behavioral recovery. The neurobiology of these repair events suggests several therapeutic targets to promote further recovery. Traditional rehabilitation is one of the therapeutic tools to augment the poststroke recovery process. A wide range of repair-based therapies is also in development. 38 Rehabilitation and repair is a relatively young and diverse field yet extends from the first days of inpatient care to ensuing care by rehabilitative specialists to years of chronic care in a range of settings. Current research topics span plasticity, normal learning, pharmacology, genetics, robotic engineering, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and speech therapy and growth in these areas will continue to improve rehabilitation. 39 Four steps for stroke rehabilitation/recovery therapies are considered subsequently. The goal of rehabilitation/recovery stroke medicine is to have more patients achieving better recovery in the weeks after a stroke and experiencing less disability during the years that follow.\nStep 1: Translate Best Neuroscience, Including Animal and Human Studies,"}, {"section_title": "Into Poststroke Recovery Research and Patient Care", "text": "Key Issues: The neurobiology of spontaneous recovery and central nervous system repair 40 suggests several potential therapeutic approaches that could improve patient outcome, but more research is needed. Current treatment options are limited. Although traditional rehabilitation medicine helps patients, a better understanding of its scientific basis could further increase its impact. Active research may also lead to design of new therapies that ultimately may win approval such as those using pharmacological, cell-based, electromagnetic, robotic, or neuroprosthetic approaches.\nRecommendations: Increased basic and translational research is needed. A deeper insight into the neurobiology of poststroke recovery is required. The means by which principles of normal learning and development can be applied to stroke recovery need to be better understood. 41 Tools for measuring the biology of stroke recovery in humans are needed, from behavioral measures with defined psychometric properties to biomarkers such as for recording physiology of repair-related events. 42 Translational studies are needed to determine the effects that various rehabilitation/repair therapies have on recovery both as isolated therapies as well as in various combinations. A number of combination approaches can be envisioned, for example, traditional rehabilitation paired with a central nervous system stimulant, brain stimulation paired with a robotic therapy (with a single computer driving both), an angiogenic growth factor followed by a synaptogenic growth factor, or exercise therapy paired with motor imagery therapy. In this regard, traditional rehabilitation can be regarded as a key tool, in the therapeutic armamentarium for stroke recovery. Like with any medical therapy, the optimal timing, intensity, duration, and content of therapy needs to be continually refined using scientifically sound approaches. Some of these issues need to be clarified for individual therapies before combining into combination therapies.

This should extend to transition to the community and then to a multiyear chronic phase of rehabilitation. Monetary and payment incentives must be redefined to drive implementation of these protocols. The lessons from published studies and best practices must be operationalized. 45 This can be partly achieved by improved benchmarking of processes, outcomes, and costs.\nMedical school and postgraduate training should incorporate the protocols and best practices and should include suitable educational media and modules to support the implementation.\nMany of these solutions can be addressed by development of Stroke Recovery Research Centers."}, {"section_title": "Step 3: Develop Consensus on, Then Implementation of, Standardized Clinical and Surrogate Measurements", "text": "Key Issues: The best standardized measures of behavior and outcomes after stroke need to be defined and then placed into clinical practice, at the same time continuing to generate appropriate research.

These might be used as predictive tools for outcome and thus be of value for triage; as entry criteria in clinical trials of repair-related therapies; or in evaluating treatment outcomes to guide clinical decisionmaking.\nAchieving consensus on clinical measures and biomarkers in this context would be useful for clinical practice and also for developing clinical trials of therapies targeting stroke recovery.\nRecommendations: Experts need to be gathered to discuss these issues and to propose unifying strategies to achieve rapid progress in the study of rehabilitation interventions. One possible mechanism would be an International Harmonization Conference, which would help achieve expert consensus on poststroke behavioral and clinical measures as well as on surrogate markers, as has been done in other neurological conditions.

Other programs such as those from the AHA/ASA (http://my.americanheart.org/professional/) and the ESO (www.stroke-university.com/) provide professional educational resources. Globally, there are insufficient numbers of physicians trained in stroke. Neurovascular Education and Training in Stroke Management and Acute Reperfusion Therapy (NET SMART) is a government-funded, evidence-based, online educational system (www.netsmart-stroke.com/) offering programs to support the learning needs of advanced practice nurses (nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists). Stroke-educated nurses, more numerous than physicians, are capable of playing instrumental roles within telestroke networks. 55 In Europe, a downloadable eCME certificate can be obtained that is recognized by other programs such as the European Masters in Stroke Medicine (www.donau-uni.ac.at/ en/studium/strokemedicine/index.php).\nThe WSO's \"ABC of Stroke Management\" program is directed to healthcare providers in developing countries. It is being used in China, South Africa, and Vietnam and is an effective tool for postgraduate medical training. 56, 57 In Viet-nam, 6000 medical doctors have finished WSO-sponsored stroke training. Approaches for rapid and accurate diagnosis and the importance of prevention of complications are emphasized. 58 Improving the availability of effective medications throughout the world is critical. The use of telemedicine to extend stroke expertise to underserved areas may be possible. 48 The wider use of early mobilization and task-dependent rehabilitation to optimize long-term outcomes, including reintegration of patients with stroke into the family, workplace, and community, is an important goal. It is important to develop a concept of \"brain health\" that can be promoted for primordial and secondary prevention.\nPatient and bystander responses to stroke symptoms are often delayed. 59 Patient-focused voluntary organizations have developed programs to increase the stroke knowledge of the general public, patients with stroke, and their families. The AHA/ASA along with the American Academy of Neurology and the American College of Emergency Physicians (Give-Me-5), the ESO, and the Stroke Alliance for Europe (SAFE) have developed informational brochures and advertisements for this purpose. It is important to further disseminate these materials as teaching aids in schools and communities."}, {"section_title": "Recommendations:", "text": "Step 1: Increase education directed at professionals including healthcare providers on a global scale by using on-site and website stroke teaching programs that are integrated into the medical education curricula. Recommendations should be based on a \"brain health\" concept that enables promotion of preventive measures. The aim is to make professional specialized care available to patients with stroke throughout the world within the next decade.\nStep 2: Further develop national health education programs offered for stroke survivors and their families. These programs should be offered in schools and communities under the leadership of the scientific organizations such as the WSO, the AHA/ASA, the ESO, and other regional organizations. The aim is to improve stroke prevention and the public's recognition and response to stroke symptoms.\nStep 3: Increase funding for public education and research supported by regional and national agencies. Continue support for advocacy aimed at improving the organization of the delivery of stroke-related health care based on evidence-based recommendations addressing gaps in the care delivery system.\nStep 4: Educate and inform the general public about stroke risk factors, prevention, and response. Use best practices such as \"Give Me 5,\" aimed at improving recognition of stroke symptoms, the ASA's \"You're the Cure\" advocacy program and the \"Strike Out Stroke\" campaign in Europe."}, {"section_title": "Part 2: Educating and Energizing the Public and Policymakers", "text": "Introduction-Worldwide efforts to increase knowledge and concern about stroke, its prevention, treatment opportunities, and outcomes have also focused on politicians and key opinion leaders. The role of governmental policy on stroke research and care is increasingly recognized.\nIn the United States, advocacy efforts have largely been directed at increasing or at least sustaining funding for research supported by the NIH. 60 Advocacy, in part, led to NIH Progress Review Groups aimed at identifying targets and strategies for stroke-related research. In addition, national advocacy efforts have supported cardiovascular and stroke prevention activities of the CDC. Specific targets included support of Food and Drug Administration oversight of tobacco products. Within states, advocacy has been aimed at improving the organization of the delivery of stroke-related health care. 31 Individual states have established stroke task forces or legislative committees focused on stroke care issues such as assessments by emergency responders, transport of patients with stroke to the nearest appropriate hospital, identification of primary stroke centers and acute stroke treatment-capable hospitals, and the use of telemedicine. Legislation to prevent cigarette smoking in indoor public spaces has been enacted in several states.\nEducating the public about stroke risk factors, prevention, and response has been challenging. Public knowledge about stroke in the United States continues to be poor, particularly in minority communities. 61, 62 Recently, the ASA, American College of Emergency Physicians, and American Academy of Neurology began a uniform education campaign, \"Give Me 5,\" aimed at improving recognition of stroke symptoms. The ASA Power to End Stroke program focuses on blacks, who have approximately twice the risk compared with white Americans. \"You're the Cure\" is the AHA/ASA grassroots advocacy network. Through \"You're the Cure,\" thousands of advocates can be mobilized to support specific pieces of legislation or programs affecting stroke through targeted e-mails, phone calls, and letters to relevant policymakers. Although a great deal has been accomplished, much remains to be done.\nThe European Parliament founded the SAFE in 2004, which includes representatives from 17 countries. 63 In Eu-rope, policymakers have become engaged in the European Union by activities from the European Brain Council, the ESO jointly with the European Stroke Conference, and the SAFE movement. Topics include the promotion of awareness of stroke-related health costs 64 and the large discrepancies between eastern and western Europe, including the much higher prevalence of risk factors and stroke in eastern Europe.\nEuropean specialist groups have lobbied for increased funding from the European Science Foundation and led to a European Stroke Workshop in Brussels hosted by the Euro-pean Commission. The resulting European Stroke Network links stroke research from bench to bedside. 65 New initiatives (\"Strike Out Stroke\" 2009) address the general public as well as members of the European Parliament focusing on problems related to the use of anticoagulants for patients with stroke."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "To accelerate progress in stroke, we need to reach beyond it scientifically, conceptually, and pragmatically.\nScientifically the solutions lie beyond our limited models. All the major neurological brain diseases share common mechanisms such as inflammation, apoptosis, mitochondrial damage, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and neurotransmitter failure. 66 By and large these mechanisms are studied in relation to individual diseases, not from a biological, evolutionary, or integrated viewpoint. A close study of the development of the nervous system may hold many clues as to how the brain repairs itself. Moreover, development and aging may to some extent be mirror images of each other. Stroke in the neonatal brain, 67 children, and women 68, 69 has special features that need to be understood and addressed.\nOur focus has been on lesions in the brain. Aging and the complex interaction of genetics, epigenetics, and environment and the occurrence of concomitant pathology render individuals' brains unique. For example, cerebral infarcts shrink and the inflammation subsides with time. The opposite occurs experimentally in the presence of amyloid. 70 Given that several common neurological conditions share the same mechanisms, a systematic approach may produce therapeutic targets that would be of benefit to more than one disease. It matters not only what lesion, but whose brain.\nConceptually we need to think not only of dramatic strokes of sudden onset, sometimes heralded by sudden losses of speech, sight, movement, or feeling, but of subclinical strokes, the most prevalent type of cerebrovascular disease identifiable by subtle cognitive dysfunction, usually a change in executive function. 12 Moreover, in the elderly brain, amyloid deposition and Alzheimer lesions may coexist and at times interact with the vascular lesions.\nPragmatically we need to realize that if we are to become more effective in the diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, and prevention of stroke, we have to reach beyond our hospitals and clinics into the community, other disciplines, and the public and a larger part of the world.\nWe need to survey, systematize, and synergize what we do. We need to survey broadly, systematically, and specifically what we know of basic brain mechanisms of disease. We need to become aware of other models such as infectious diseases, which often has an integrated, epidemiological, clinical, and basic science approach.\nIn terms of acute care and rehabilitation, an organized approach seems to have been the key to the many advances. Although countries like Spain have a national stroke strategy and effective regional programs such as those of Catalonia 71 and Madrid, 72 the majority of countries do not. Stroke unit care should be considered a treatment/intervention in itself similar to any pharmacological treatment or a surgical procedure. There may well be other models such as trauma that may provide useful parallels and lessons.\nSystematization and evaluation has been a key in many of the advances that have occurred in stroke in the past 4 decades. A prototype has been the randomized clinical trial, in which a hypothesis is tested according to prospectively agreed protocols, the collection of the data monitored, and the results evaluated. Randomized clinical trials are but 1 example of the more generic principles.\nWe need to reach beyond North America, western Europe, and Japan, where most clinical trials have been performed. Other parts of the world are creating infrastructures that make them capable of participating in clinical trials and other studies that can accelerate finding the answers to many common problems. The Extracranial-Intracranial (EC/IC) Bypass Study 73 was an early example of how an international randomized clinical trial could reach an answer much more quickly than if it had been done in 1 country alone. More recently we saw the example of the first proof of tissue plasminogen activator effectiveness in stroke being demonstrated in an American study, 4 whereas the extension of the time window was recently shown by a European study. 74 We need to become imaginative in designing multiple types of clinical trials, from active registries to simple and more complex randomized clinical trials. The idea would be that everything that is done in relation to stroke becomes part of some evaluation. An important aspect of any evaluation is standardization with a need to make minimum common definitions of important items in a protocol so that databases can be made compatible and larger volumes of information can become available for analysis, model-building, and testing.\nAt the moment, we have a glut of guidelines but not enough guidance or guides. 75 Most guidelines are developed on the basis of the level of evidence, but little attention is devoted to the relative impact of specific items. Not all are of equal value. 76 We need to evaluate and rank the relative value of each activity in terms of return per unit investment of time, resources, or both. 77 The comparative effectiveness research thus generated would improve clinical decision-making and lead to better allocation of scarce medical resources.\nStroke is no longer a disease of affluence. Approximately 87% of the 5.7 million deaths annually attributable to stroke occur in low-income and middle-income countries. 78 The risk factors like hypertension, diabetes, and obesity are assuming epidemic proportions. Some 285 million people worldwide will live with diabetes in 2010, 70% of whom will live in developing countries. 79 Moreover, by 2050, the population aged \u2265 60 years is expected almost to triple, increasing to 1.6 billion in the developing countries. 80 The Institute of Medicine's recent report recommends building evidence-based, locally relevant solutions by improving global collaboration among stakeholders to promote cardiovascular health in the developing world. 81 Aligning chronic disease priorities with other health and development priorities has the potential to synergistically improve economic and health status.\nThere is much value in doing the simple things right in terms of prevention. \"Death in old age is inevitable, but most deaths before old age are avoidable.\" 82 Hypertension is the single most powerful and prevalent risk factor for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke and vascular cognitive impairment and yet too often it remains unrecognized or untreated. Blood pressure control has the greatest potential for stroke prevention.\nThe concept of \"vascular health\" or \"brain health\" needs to be promoted. Because atherosclerosis starts early in life, the preventive efforts should target children, youth, and mothers. Everyone needs to be involved at all stages of prevention with an emphasis on healthy living and creating an environment that nurtures it.\nFinally, we need to synergize with vertical integration of basic sciences, clinical sciences, and population approaches. The digital age provides wonderful opportunities for integrating and evaluating all aspects of our activities."}, {"section_title": "Next Steps", "text": "The immediate need is to pursue specific recommendations:"}, {"section_title": "Support the efforts of Raad Shakir, Secretary General of the World Federation of Neurology and Chair of the Expert Committee advising on Diseases of the Nervous", "text": "System for the International Classification of Diseases 84 (ICD-11), and Bo Norrving, President of the WSO, to reclassify stroke from a cardiovascular to a disease of the nervous system and vascular dementia from mental diseases to brain diseases."}, {"section_title": "8.", "text": "Precompetitive stroke recovery initiative: We should consider precompetitive consortia for stroke recovery that is similar to that currently in operation for Alzheimer disease-the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimag-ing Initiative (ADNI). 85 Perhaps collectively (academia, industry, and government), we could create a \"SRNI\" (stroke recovery neuroimaging initiative), a precompetitive consortia to enroll and carefully study patients for the natural history of stroke recovery: imaging, scales, and biological samples.
