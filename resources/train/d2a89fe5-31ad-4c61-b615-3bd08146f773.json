Source: USDA, Economic Research Service, 1996, 1997, 1998(version 1), 1999, 2000, and 2001 Agricultural Resource Management Survey, Phase III. 1 Chapter 4 examines the performance of farm businesses based on their efficiency in using inputs to produce output. It also examines the effects of treating the farm household as a business that combines both farm output and off-farm work. 2 This chapter examines successful farms in all typology groups. It expands on earlier ERS analyses that assessed limited groupings of farms, such as low-and high-sales farms (Perry and Johnson, 1999); limitedresource, low-sales, and high-sales farms (Mishra et al., 1999b); cash grain farms (Mishra et al.,1999a); or dairy farms (Mishra and Morehart,2001). To identify top performers, farms in the 2001 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) were first sorted into the more homogeneous groups of the ERS farm typology. 3 Farms within each group were then sorted by operator labor and management income (OLMI), and those in each group's highest quartile were designated top-performing farms. Those in the lowest quartile, the \"bottom-performing\" farms, formed a comparison group. The proper measure of economic performance is subject to debate among accountants and economists (Mishra et al., 1999a;Mishra and Morehart, 2001). OLMI adjusts net farm income for implicit costs of capital and unpaid labor contributed by family members other than the operator. No charge is made for the operator's unpaid labor; it is included in OLMI as a residual return to the operator. Farm operator households bear implicit, or opportunity, costs for the use of their capital and labor because they forego paid labor returns (income) elsewhere when they contribute work to the farm and the farm foregoes a return (income) on capital used on the farm that could have been earned income in a nonfarm investment. OLMI also reflects decisions concerning choice of farm enterprises, combination of inputs, and other financial and management decisions. The success of farm businesses ultimately depends on how farm operators manage their resources. We define OLMI as follows: Net farm income, Labor hours and net worth are reported in ARMS, but we must estimate the implicit wage rate and return on equity. We use the mean wage earned by farm labor in a State, as reported by NASS each year. The return on equity used here was 1.9 percent, the average return in agriculture estimated by ERS for the 10-year period ending in 2001. OLMI is a fairly narrow, short-term measure. It does not include longer term benefits, such as potential capital gains from holding farmland. Nor does it include the rural lifestyle that is important to many households operating both large and small farms (see box, \"Total Returns From Farming\"). Although bottom-performing farms rank low when performance is measured in terms of OLMI, they still may be successful operations when performance is defined more broadly. Structural and Financial Characteristics of U.S. Farms / AIB-797 Economic Research Service/USDA 3 We use data from version 1 of the 2001 ARMS Phase III, because it collects the most detailed data on the farm operator, farm household, and farm business. Use of version 1 limits our sample to 5,400 farms, and limits the information that can be provided for small subsets of farms, such as limited-resource farms. Returns from farming are typically defined narrowly, generally in terms of net income. Operator labor and management income (OLMI)-used in this chapter to measure financial performance-is a net income measure with adjustments for unpaid labor and for capital. There are returns to farming, however, that are not included in net income (Ahearn et al., 2004). In fact, net income is just one component of total returns. Total returns from farming include: Net income from the farm business. This can be defined in various ways, but all definitions involve subtracting expenses from gross income. Capital gains. Farming provides operators with an opportunity for capital gains from the eventual sale of farm assets, particularly farmland. Opportunity to make bequests. Farmers may plan to pass the farm on to their descendents. Like capital gains, bequests occur in the long run. Tax sheltering current off-farm income. Farm losses can be written off against off-farm income when calculating income tax. The writeoff is unlimited, if the farm has the potential to be profitable and the filer is materially involved in running the farm (Freshwater and Reimer, 1995). OLMI is probably most useful as a performance measure for farming-occupation, large, and very large farms, where getting the highest income, given available resources, is likely to be a major objective of operators and their households. For many retirement and residential/lifestyle farms some of the other factors listed above may be more important, since households operating these farms often have substantial off-farm income. Ranking farms by OLMI to identify top and bottom performers assumes that the farm business is run independently of any decisions of the farm operator to work off-farm. This assumption is relaxed in chapter 4, when farm efficiency measures are estimated taking account of any off-farm work."}, {"section_title": "Total Returns From Farming", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Farm Finances", "text": "Top performers use debt and capital (net worth) effectively. In general, topperforming farms tend to generate more gross income per dollar of debt and per dollar of capital (net worth) than do bottom performers (table 3-2). Mean gross cash farm income for top performers generally exceeds that of bottom performers, dramatically so among very large family farms. In addition, top performers tend to maintain lower mean values of debt and net worth than bottom performers. Very large family farms are an exception. Top performers in this group have greater debt and net worth, but because they also have much greater gross cash income, their gross income per dollar of debt or net worth is also much greater. Structural and Financial Characteristics of U.S. Farms / AIB-797 Economic Research Service/USDA Top performers also are more likely to have much lower operating expense ratios-the ratio of cash operating expenses to gross cash farm income. Bottom-performing residential/lifestyle farms, for example, use $1.80 in operating expenses to produce each $1.00 of gross cash income. In contrast, the top performers in most typology groups use only 60 cents of operating expenses to produce each dollar of gross cash income. The exceptionally low operating expense ratio for top-performing retirement farms, 38 percent, reflects the large portion of gross income these farms receive from participation in the Conservation Reserve and Wetlands Reserve Programs (CRP and WRP), which require little annual expenditure. Forty-five percent of top-performing retirement farms participate in CRP or WRP, and the programs account for 28 percent of their gross cash farm income. Only 7 percent of bottom-performing retirement farms participate in CRP or WRP, and they receive only 2 percent of their gross cash farm income from the programs. So far, income and debt have been considered separately. Financial position simultaneously considers a farm's net farm income and debt/asset ratio. Most top-performing farms in each typology group have a favorable financial position; they have positive net farm income and a debt-to-asset ratio of no more than 40 percent (table 3-3). Over 23 percent of very large top performers, however, are classified as marginally solvent (positive net farm income and a debt/asset ratio higher than 40 percent). The situation is different for bottom-performing farms. Between 51 and 69 percent, depending on the typology group, fall in the marginal income category, with negative net farm income but low debt/asset ratios. These farms may have low income due to events such as drought, crop or livestock disease, or market conditions. However, 18 to 25 percent of the bottom-performing farms in the residential/lifestyle, high-sales, large, and very large groups are classified as vulnerable, with negative income and debt/asset levels above 40 percent. Business survival may be more problematic for them.  "}, {"section_title": "Employment of Household Land and Labor Resources", "text": "Operators of top-performing farms limit their use of household resources, such as owned land and unpaid family labor. Operators do not pay explicit prices for using such resources, and hence may be tempted to overuse them. But land can be rented out or sold, yielding returns that are not captured when the operator farms the land. Family members can work off the farm, bringing in pay foregone when working on the farm. Our OLMI measure is designed to account for the implicit costs of using land and unpaid family labor-other than the operator's-in the farm business. Land constitutes the bulk of farm assets, so farm debt and net worth often reflect land holdings. In general, top-performing farms use less land than bottom performers. Average acreage operated is actually less-by a statistically significant amount-for top-performing than for bottom-performing farms in the residential/lifestyle, low-sales, and large family farm groups (table 3-4). Top performers in these groups also tend to own and rent fewer acres of land. The effective use of labor is an important determinant of farm performance. In table 3-5, we report three elements of farm employment: (1) average annual hours worked by the operator; (2) whether the spouse is also an operator, making day-to-day operating decisions; and (3) average annual hours worked on farm by the spouse, regardless of whether the spouse is an operator. Operators of bottom-performing farms report working more hours in all the small family farm groups, and the differences are statistically significant for retirement, residential/lifestyle, and low-sales farms. Also, on small farms with less than $100,000 in sales (retirement, residential/lifestyle, and low-sales family farms), bottom-performing farms are much more likely to report that spouses also make operating decisions. Finally, in every typology group, spouses in bottom-performing farms work more hours, and the differences are substantial in most cases.  Bottom-performing farms may have suffered unexpected setbacks from weather, disease, or accidents that led to reduced sales as well as increased family labor commitments to the farm. But in general, top performers seem to better manage the use of land and household labor resources. They perform well, in part, because they do not commit their labor and land to activities that provide low returns. On the other hand, some households operating bottom-performing farms may devote more of their resources to farming because they lack viable alternatives."}, {"section_title": "Organizing the Farm Business", "text": "Farmers make several fundamental long-term decisions when designing a business strategy. They choose which products to produce. They also choose a business organization-sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation-for the farm. Finally, they choose arrangements for selling the farm's products. Commodity choices appear to be connected to performance in some typology groups (table 3-6). Bottom performers in the retirement, residential/lifestyle, and low-sales farms groups are substantially more likely than top performers to specialize in livestock, largely beef and other livestock (including horses), perhaps in part because their land is less suited for crop production. In addition, beef cattle (particularly cow-calf operations) often require little labor (Cash, 2002) and are compatible with off-farm work and retirement. Among very large family farms, bottom performers are also more likely to specialize in livestock, while top-performing farms frequently specialize in high-value crops (vegetables, fruits and nuts, and nursery and greenhouse crops) and dairy.  "}, {"section_title": "Farming-occupation", "text": "Choice of business organization does not seem to be highly associated with performance within a typology group. The share of farms in each group organized as a partnership or corporation grows significantly with farm size across the typology (table 3-7). But within each group, similar shares of top and bottom performers are organized as partnerships or corporations, with the exception of very large farms, where top performers are more likely to be partnerships or corporations. Top performers among very large farms are much larger, measured in gross cash income, than bottom performers (table 3-2), and the difference in organization likely reflects this. Contract use is strongly associated with farm size, and farms in the limitedresource, retirement, and residential/lifestyle groups rarely use contracts, regardless of performance. Among very large farms, bottom performers are more likely to use contracts, particularly production contracts. In the remaining groups (farming-occupation small farms and large family farms), top performers are more likely to use contracts (  between top and bottom performers in these remaining groups is strongly statistically significant only for large farms, particularly in the case of marketing contracts. Differences between top-and bottom-performing farms may reflect differing commodity orientations of the performance groups, particularly for very large farms."}, {"section_title": "Operator Household Income", "text": "The level and sources of household income (see Appendix II, \"Measuring Farm Operator Household Income\") vary widely across typology groups and between top and bottom performers within a given typology group (table 3-8). Regardless of farm size, however, farm earnings make a positive contribution to average household income for top performers. Depending on the typology group, between 59 and 99 percent of top-performing households have positive household income, with a positive contribution from farming. In contrast, average farm earnings are negative for bottom performers, as one would expect. The contribution of farm earnings is particularly large for households operating high-sales farms, large family farms, and very large family farms. Mean household income for top performers in each of these groups far exceeds that of bottom performers, and farm earnings account for most of household income. Bottom performers in each category have large losses from farming, and those losses far exceed off-farm income for the two largest farm groupings.  larly useful to households operating bottom-performing retirement and residential/lifestyle farms."}, {"section_title": "Operator Characteristics: Age and Education", "text": "Few differences in age or education exist between operators of top-and bottom-performing farms (table 3-9). Top-performing operators of very large farms, however, tend to be younger than their bottom-performing counterparts. Average age for top performers in the group is 48 years, versus 51 years for bottom performers, and a larger share of top performers is younger than 55. Top performers also average 7 years less in experience as a farm operator. All farmers value a rural lifestyle, but an adequate income from farming is most important to those operating farms with sales greater than $100,000  Note: Based on farms that were drawn for sample data collection in 1997, 1992, and 1987. "}, {"section_title": "Summary and Conclusions", "text": "Operator characteristics, business organization, and contracting do not seem to be strongly related to performance in most typology groups. Still, operators of top-performing very large farms are younger and have more formal education than bottom performers in that group, and their farms are more likely to be partnerships or family corporations. These differences, however, are most likely related to the exceptionally large size-measured in gross cash income-of top-performing farms in the very large group. Similarly, the relationship between performance and contracting is not clear. Top performers in the very large group are less likely to have contracts (especially production contracts), while top performers in the large group are more likely to have contracts (especially marketing contracts). For other characteristics, there are significant differences between top and bottom performers. For example, top performers in four typology groups (retirement, low-sales, large, and very large) are more likely to specialize in crops, although top performers in the very large group often specialize in dairy. Top-performing farms in most of the typology groups have higher gross income per farm and control their costs better, as reflected in the lower average operating expense ratio for these farms. This is not a particularly new finding. For example, Warren and Burritt, in a 1909 study based on a survey of 178 New York farms (cited in Bergen et al., 1990), found that the more profitable farms had higher revenue and better controlled their cash expenses. There are few other consistent, systematic differences between the two performance groups that explain the success of top performers. In most of the typology groups, however, top performers report lower debt and/or net worth, on average, and use less unpaid labor. Lower debt contributes to the higher share of top performers with a favorable financial position in each group. Lower net worth also contributes to the higher operator labor and management income (OLMI) of top performers, since a deduction is made for the opportunity cost of capital in the calculation of OLMI and it helps explain why top-performing farms frequently own (and operate) less land than bottom performers The charge for unpaid household labor may explain why the spouse works less on the farm on top-performing farms. Households operating top-performing farms apparently are more aware of the opportunity costs of their capital and labor. Top-performing farm households are more likely than bottom-performing households to have a positive household income, with a positive contribution from farming. This does not mean, however, that off-farm income is inconsequential to households operating top-performing farms. Even households operating top-performing large and very large family farms receive around $30,000, on average, from off-farm sources. For top-performing households in the retirement, residential/lifestyle, and low-sales groups, average off-farm income exceeds farm earnings by a substantial margin. Farms in these typology groups, even if run effectively, are generally too small to generate enough income to support a household comfortably. In most typology groups, top performers' total household income exceeds that of the corresponding bottom-performing groups. This is not the case, however, for the retirement and residential/lifestyle groups. In these groups, bottom performers use off-farm income to finance losses from farm operations. The U.S. tax code allows farmers to write off farm losses against other income. There is no limit to the writeoff, as long as the farm has the potential to be profitable and the filer is materially involved in running the farm (Freshwater and Reimer, 1995). Top-performing farms are likely to continue in business, for they covered operating expenses and contributed to the operator household's income. A direct connection between poor farm performance in 2001 and farms going out of business is more difficult to establish. At least some of the bottomperforming farms may have simply had a poor year in 2001. If their farm income improves in later years, they are likely to continue in business. In addition, some small farms-particularly in the retirement and residential/lifestyle groups-could be bottom performers for years and still continue in business. Households operating these farms may be willing to absorb losses to meet goals other than a profitable farm, such as eventual capital gains, the ability to pass the farm on to descendents, sheltering offfarm income from taxes, and a rural lifestyle. Although small farms are more likely to leave farming (Hoppe and Korb, 2001), many continue in business as long as the operator households have other sources of income, farm losses are not unduly large, and favorable tax treatment of farm losses continues."}]
