Women and underrepresented minorities 1 (URMs) are considerably underrepresented in many of the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields; and, the engineering field, specifically, awards the lowest percentages of advanced degrees to URMs and women than any other STEM-related field (National Science Foundation (NSF), Division of Science Resource Statistics, 2010). This study aims to determine which engineering school characteristics relate to higher rates of master's and doctorate degrees for underrepresented groups. In 2010, URMs earned 2,721, or roughly 5% of engineering master's degrees, and 402, or around 4% of engineering doctoral degrees reported to the American Association of Engineering Education (ASEE). ASEE reported that women, as a group, earned 9,738, or close to 16% of engineering master's degrees, and 2,066, or roughly 23% of engineering doctoral degrees. Totals for women decline by nearly 60% when examined by citizenship. Women with U.S. citizenship or permanent residency status only earned 4,161, or around 7% of engineering master's and 885, or closer to 10% of engineering doctorate degrees awarded in 2010 (ASEE, Engineering College Profiles and Statistics, 2011). The glaring underrepresentation of women and URMs in advanced engineering programs provide researchers with distinct opportunities to examine the relationship between advanced first influenced by the individuals within them. The demographics of individuals within an organization also serve as a signal of that organization's commitment to diversity (\"A Bridge for All\u2026,\" 2004;Chubin, May, & Babco, 2005;Donnelly & Jacobi, 2010;Freehill, 2005;Zajicek, Morimoto, Terdalkar, Hunt, Rencis, & Lisnic, 2011). Thus, prospective women and URM graduate students could consider the demographics of students and faculty within an engineering school as the degree of an institution's commitment to diversity."}, {"section_title": "Shirley Malcom, as head of the Directorate for Education and Human Resources at the", "text": "American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2008, addressed the \"people make the place\" (Schneider, 1987, p. 446) and 'attraction' points related to underrepresented groups in engineering distinctly, when she indicated that \"In the future, engineering needs to offer a different face to students, especially if there is an interest in attracting females and minorities\" (2008, p. 237). She further went on to emphasize that \"failure to consider the role of graduate education in the development of faculty will ensure that the value of a diversity of perspectives, ideas, and performers will not be included into the lifeblood of the profession\" (2008, p. 237). As Dr. Malcom underscored, faculty members, as essential educators of future engineers, function as a \"face\" in the engineering field. Research indicates that women and URM faculty affect degree rates of underrepresented groups in engineering, yet too few women and URMs earn the advanced degrees necessary to attain faculty positions to teach the next generation of engineers (Freehill et al., 2008;National Academies, 2007;The Woodrow Wilson Foundation, 2005;Varma & Freehill, 2010). In addition to faculty members, research also indicates that peers play an important role in the socialization process of underrepresented students (Bhatia & Amati, 2010;Cole & Espinoza, 2008;Gardner, 2007;Hurtado, Cabrera, Lin, Arellano, & Espinosa, 2009;Mwenda, 2010;Nettles & Millet, 2006;Wilson, Holmes, deGravelles, Sylvain, Batiste, Johnson, McGuire, Pang, & Warner, 2011). Minority-serving institutions, such as a Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), serves as an illustration of the important role that institutional demographics play in the degree production of African Americans. In 2010, HBCUs comprised seven of the top 20 schools that awarded bachelor's degrees to African Americans among those schools that reported data to the ASEE. These seven schools awarded 570 of the 1,215 bachelor's degrees awarded to African Americans at the top 20 schools (Gibbons, 2010). A further analysis of these seven HBCUs showed that they averaged around 67% of African Americans enrolled at the undergraduate-level and 30% of African American tenured/tenuretrack faculty in engineering programs. The representation of African Americans at these HBCUs is far above their representation at the rest of the schools that reported data to the ASEE, where African Americans only made up roughly 5% of all undergraduates and 2% of tenured/tenuretrack faculty (ASEE, Engineering College Profiles and Statistics, 2010). Burrelli & Rapoport (2008) also highlighted the important role of HBCUs in a report that examined degree data for African Americans in science and engineering from the mid 1980's to 2006. During this time, African Americans earned 30% of baccalaureate degrees in science and engineering from HBCUs. The high proportions of African Americans at HBCUs -both students and faculty -is noteworthy considering that HBCUs only comprise 4% of the higher educational institutions in the U.S. (Redd, 2000). These statistics suggest that faculty and peers influence the socialization process of at least one group of underrepresented students, which is why it is important to examine how the composition of faculty and peers influence advanced degree production for underrepresented groups. Based partially on the research that institutional demographics play an important role in attracting underrepresented groups to a college or university, the purpose of this study was to examine how institutional features connect to advanced degree production for women and URMs in the field where these groups have been the most underrepresented historically -engineering. An institutional-level approach was utilized because: (1) it allows for an examination of institutions from which to draw a general understanding of where engineering schools fall in a group with varied institutional types, resource availabilities, demographics, and prestige, which provides higher education institutions and policy makers with a model from which to address inequalities within engineering graduate programs; and, (2) it permits a better understanding of the institutional context that recruits and educates women and URM graduate students in engineering. A focus on institutional-level resources allows researchers to focus limited funds strategically and modify policies and structures to encourage degree production (Breneman, 1970;Hanushek, 1979;Hartwig, 1978;Leetaru, 2010;Shelton & Prabhakar, 1971;Wolf-Wendel et al., 2000). It also responds to the call for studies to identify institutional factors that encourage recruitment and retention of URMs and women at advanced degree levels in engineering (Leetaru, 2010;National Academies, 2007;The Woodrow Wilson Foundation, 2005;Varma & Freehill, 2005;Wendler et al., 2010)."}, {"section_title": "Research Questions", "text": "This study examined master's and doctoral degree production rates for underrepresented groups of U.S. citizens and permanent residents. Only data for U.S. citizens and permanent residents were examined because of (1) the overrepresentation of international students in engineering advanced degree programs and (2) the demand for U.S. citizens with advanced degrees in the areas of aerospace engineering and national defense, where the nature of the research often requires workers to hold U.S. citizenship or permanent residency status (Augustine, 2005;NSF, Division of Science Resources Statistics, 2009). Both underrepresented groups were also analyzed for degree rates for master's and doctorates separately. A majority of engineering doctorate recipients earn a master's degree en route to a doctorate, and engineering master's degree rates overall have increased by almost onethird in the last ten years (NSF, Division of Science Resources Statistics, 2010;Wendler et al., 2010). The role of a master's degree -as an essential component in the socialization process for graduate students -is one reason that Lange (2006) analyzed master's degree origin data for URMs with doctorates in STEM fields. Lange reported that engineering doctorate recipients, as well as URMs in STEM fields, were more likely to earn a master's on the way to a doctorate. Lange also found that URMs were more likely to earn a master's degree in STEM fields from different institutions than their doctorate degree, although engineering doctorate recipients were more likely to earn their master's and doctorate degree from the same institution. Although Lange's findings related to the general educational pathway of engineering doctorate recipients are not surprising, as the common pathway to a doctorate in engineering often includes a prior master's degree (Kane & Gonzalez-Lenahan, 2007), her finding that engineering doctorate recipients are more likely to earn both advanced degrees from the same institution provide a point for possible comparison of top producing engineering schools for underrepresented groups with advanced degrees in this study. Thus, factors that influence master's degree rates for women and URMs could serve as a basis for examining factors related to doctoral degree production for underrepresented groups, and is a central reason that this study also analyzes master's degree production rates. Chapter II further examines the educational pathway of engineering doctorate recipients. This study analyzed engineering advanced degree production rates for the following groups of U.S. citizens and permanent residents: (1) URMs, defined as blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans and (2) women, defined as all women with U.S. citizenship or permanent residency status. The URM definition only includes those groups the NSF identifies as underrepresented (NSF, Division of Science Resources Statistics, 2011). Since the NSF does not include Asians in its definition of underrepresented, they are not included in the URM definition in this study. Since all women with U.S. citizenship or permanent residency were included in the definition for 'women,' Asians with either of these statuses were included in this group.\nThis study examined master's and doctoral degree production rates for the following groups of U.S. citizens and permanent residents: (1) URMs, defined as blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans and (2) women, defined as all women with U.S. citizenship or permanent residency status.

What institutional characteristics are related to the doctoral degree production rate of URMs in engineering? 3. What institutional characteristics are related to the master's degree production rate of women in engineering? 4. What institutional characteristics are related to the doctoral degree production rate of women in engineering?"}, {"section_title": "Conceptual Framework Overview", "text": "Two main frameworks were employed to examine engineering master's and doctoral degree production for women and URMs in this study. These included the (1) education production function (Hopkins, 1990) and (2) theory of institutional capital (Bourdieu, 1984;Bourdieu & Wacquant, 1992;Brosnan, 2010;Fogarty, 1997;Jewel, 2008). In its most basic form, the education production function examines how inputs convert into outputs (Hopkins, 1990). In a variety of education production function studies, data associated with enrollments, faculty productivity, or institutional expenditures were analyzed as inputs, while degree data were examined as outputs (Dundar & Lewis, 1995;Hanushek, 1979;Hartwig, 1978;Hubbard & Stage, 2010;Monk, 1989;Shelton & Prabhakar, 1971;Titus, 2009;Wolf-Wendel et al., 2000). These variables, however, can be used on either side of the production function equation, depending upon the purpose of the study. For example, studies by Hartwig (1978) and Shelton & Prabhakar (1971) used the production function to determine efficiencies within engineering programs. Input variables for these studies included aspects related to an engineering school's faculty members and average time to degree, while output variables included those related to the number of degrees at the baccalaureate, master's, and doctoral-level, average enrollment, and average research expenditures. Hanushek (1979) advised that the production function is mainly an economic concept, and that researchers who utilize it should also couple it with a guiding framework. Wolf-Wendel and others (2000) addressed this criticism in their study of baccalaureate origins of underrepresented women with doctorate degrees by coupling the education production function with the theory of baccalaureate origins. Similarly, this study addresses Hanushek's criticism by using the theory of institutional capital as a lens from which to examine variables in the education production function model. Bourdieu's (1984) theory of capital to outcomes in the fields of accounting, law, and medicine (Brosnan, 2010;Fogarty, 1997;Jewel, 2008). Bourdieu's theory of capital generally connects an individual's capital, such as someone's background or socioeconomic status to that person's role within a culture. Bourdieu's theory highlights individual challenges to compete for capital or assets associated with different forms of capital such as those tied to cultural, economic, or symbolic resources. In general, Bourdieu connected cultural capital to desirable resources that develop from being a part of a certain group over time, economic capital to specific monetary goods, and symbolic capital to an individual's status in a society. Bourdieu also applied his concept of capital to 'fields,' and used higher education as an example of a 'field' where programs continually compete for the best resources to position themselves among competitors. Researchers that applied Bourdieu's concept of capital to outcomes in the fields of accounting, law, and medicine did so from the notion that certain organizational factors influenced outcomes in a particular field. These studies served as the framework for how institutional capital was applied to engineering school characteristics in this study, and these studies and the theory of capital are further discussed in Chapter II."}, {"section_title": "Researchers have applied", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Significance of Study", "text": "Previous research on advanced degree production among underrepresented groups calls to examine data by field (Nettles & Millett, 2006;NRC, 2001;Wendler et al., 2010), yet studies often explore this issue in the broader context of 'STEM' programs. Occasionally, national reports highlight differences between STEM fields; however, the frequent pattern of national agencies, such as the NSF, to group science and engineering together when examining degree data for underrepresented groups makes it difficult to grasp the actual representation of women and URMs in specific fields. 'Science and engineering,' for example, includes the social sciences and psychology. In 2006-07, URMs and women represented around 11% and 47% of science and engineering doctoral degree recipients, respectively. The fields of social science and psychology, however, contributed to over half of the doctoral degree production in 'science' for women and URMs. Women earned nearly 4,700 of their 9,300 doctoral degrees; and, URMs earned nearly 3,700 of their approximately 8,000 total doctoral degrees in these fields (NSF, Division of Science Resources Statistics, SED, 2003-07). Degree attainment differences exist even within specific fields of engineering. In 2010, URMs and women with U.S. citizenship or permanent residency status earned their highest rates of doctorate degrees in chemical engineering. Women undergraduate engineering students also earned their highest degree rates in chemical engineering in 2010, which partly explains why their doctorate degree rates are highest in this field. URMs in engineering, on the other hand, earned their highest bachelor's degree rates in the field of mechanical engineering (ASEE, Engineering College Profiles and Statistics, 2010). These statistics reveal important differences within the field of engineering. Researchers credit the chemical engineering field as being more attractive to women because of its perceived flexibility for a career path. Women with interests in chemistry or biology, for example, recognize that an engineering degree could offer them a broader career path compared to a science degree, and those with an interest in chemistry or biology find a chemical engineering degree to be a good fit. Women also indicate that a chemical engineering degree provides the training necessary to enter law or medical school and give back to their community or family either through the medical field or higher salaries that are typically received in this field. Chemical engineers often earn higher salaries because it is perceived as one of the hardest engineering disciplines, and some women even indicate that earning a degree in the toughest field is what attracted them to chemical engineering (Brawner, Lord, & Ohland, 2011). The engineering field includes a variety of majors, all of which challenge students to think about problems from a particular engineering perspective. Even though students normally enroll in a specific engineering major (i.e., chemical), the field has become increasingly interdisciplinary as engineers work together to solve complex problems (National Academies, 2004). The goal of this study was to examine 'engineering' as a main field within 'STEM' to first determine if there are certain engineering school characteristics that relate to higher advanced degree production rates overall for underrepresented groups. The findings from this study can then be examined for how they relate to specific majors within the discipline. In addition to extracting 'engineering' from 'STEM' in an analysis of engineering school characteristics that relate to advanced degree production rates of underrepresented groups, this study only analyzes data on U.S. citizens and permanent residents for 'women.' Women with U.S. citizenship and permanent residency status earned less than half of the master's or doctorate degrees granted to 'women' as a group in 2010 (ASEE, Engineering College Profiles and Statistics, 2011). A problematic trend when examining data on STEM degrees is that, unlike URMs, statistics for women are normally reported in one category instead of being separated out as a subcategory within U.S. citizens, which often results in misleading data when 'women' are discussed in the context of 'underrepresented. ' Ferreira (2009) pointed this phenomena out in her study of women's gains in doctorate programs in STEM fields, where she analyzed degree trends from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) from 1996-2006. Ferreira reported that although women have made gains in earning engineering doctorates, their percentage is even further behind their male counterparts when only statistics for U.S. citizens are analyzed. Whereas the NSF reported an increase in engineering doctorate degrees for women between 1997 and 2007, from around 12% to 21%, Ferreira reported that figures for women with U.S. citizenship were closer to 8% each year between 1996 and 2006, or close to no growth at all during this time period. Accordingly, this study will address Ferreria's concerns by only considering U.S. citizens and permanent residents in totals for 'women.' Since women and URMs earn such low proportions of engineering doctorate degrees, engineering undergraduate students have few underrepresented role models among engineering faculty members. Research suggests that women and minority faculty positively influence students at both the baccalaureate and doctorate-degree levels (Brazziel & Brazziel, 1997;Fox, 2001;Nettles & Millett, 2006;Price, 2010;Sonnert, Fox, & Adkins, 2007). In engineering, however, less than 15% of engineering faculty were women and less than 25% were minority (including Asians) in 2008 (Burrelli, 2008). The issue of limited role models for women and minorities in engineering follows students from undergraduate studies through the doctorate degree. Reports call to address the shortage of women and URMs with doctoral degrees in engineering fields, because these groups need to be represented among faculty members who will teach the next generation of highly demanded employees in the STEM workforce (National Academies, 2007;The Woodrow Wilson Foundation, 2005;Varma & Freehill, 2010). Lowell & Regets (2006) pointed out that STEM-related jobs grew by 670% between 1950 and 2000. Other jobs only grew by around 130% during this same time period. The Building Engineering and Science Talent (BEST) program, a union between public and private organizations that seeks to increase the number of underrepresented groups participating in the STEM labor force, further emphasizes the importance of role models, and employs the reoccurring 'face' symbol to emphasize the value of such role models: As minority scholars complete their degrees and enter the professoriate, their presence will magnify the diverse intellectual talents they bring with them, and the unique contributions they make as members of groups long underrepresented in the science faculty ranks. Such diversity can only enhance the quality of our nation's postsecondary enterprise, while changing the face of the role models for succeeding generations of scholars and citizens (A Bridge for All: Higher Education Design Principles to Broaden Participation in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, 2004, p. 29). The Woodrow Wilson Foundation's report on Ph.D. production for underrepresented groups, the National Academy of Science's \"Rising above the Gathering Storm\" (2007) and \"Expanding Underrepresented Minority Participation\" (2011) reports, \" Freehill et al.'s (2008) \"Confronting the \"New\" American Dilemma. Underrepresented Minorities in Engineering: A data-based look at diversity,\" and Varma & Freehill's (2010) \"Special Issue on Science and Technology Workforce\" all call for the need to diversify the educators who train future STEM workers. This diversity is needed to provide underrepresented groups with an opportunity for equal advancement, for science and engineering fields to benefit from diverse points of view needed to solve complex problems, and for the U.S. to compete globally in science and engineering (Freehill et al., 2008;National Academies, 2007;The Woodrow Wilson Foundation, 2005;Varma & Freehill, 2010). Underrepresented groups add to the highly in-demand engineering workforce, offer diverse perspectives to solve problems for a heterogeneous population, and enhance a profession's ability to consider methods to attract URMs and women into the field (Fleming, 2008;Freehill et al., 2008;National Academies, 2007;The Woodrow Wilson Foundation, 2005;Varma & Freehill, 2010). This study examines the influence of institutional demographics, or the 'face' of engineering schools, on advanced degree production for underrepresented groups, and serves as a basis from which administrators and higher education policy makers can modify institutional features and policies within engineering schools to better promote advanced degree programs to underrepresented groups. While engineering schools may not be able to change individuals, administrators and higher education policy makers are able to modify structures and resources that influence degree rates for underrepresented groups (National Academies, 2007; National Academies, 2011; The Woodrow Wilson Foundation, 2005;Varma & Freehill, 2010). This study contributes to the higher education literature by offering university administrators and policy makers a better understanding of which institutional features encourage advanced degree production for underrepresented individuals in a specific discipline."}, {"section_title": "Summary of Introduction", "text": "Higher education administrators and policy makers must understand how institutional factors influence advanced degree rates for underrepresented groups in engineering, in order to attract higher proportions of URMs and women into engineering graduate degree programs in the future. This chapter highlighted the important role of examining graduate degree production rates specifically for non-foreign women and URMs in the field where they are the most underrepresented -engineering. Bourdieu's (1984) framework on capital as an institutional resource, and the education production function (Hopkins, 1990) suggest that a study that includes an analysis of successful engineering graduate degree producing institutions should do so by examining institutional resources, characteristics, and demographics. This chapter provided an overview of the importance of the development of such a model to assess successful engineering graduate degree producing institutions, and outlined the conceptual model and research questions that are used to examine institutions' graduate production rates for women and URMs in engineering.

According to NSF data on advanced degrees earned from the mid-1960s to today, men dominated advanced engineering programs, and 'men' -as a group -continue to be overrepresented at the doctoral-level. In 1967, men (mostly U.S. citizens at the time) earned 2,595 of the 2,604 doctoral degrees awarded in engineering (NSF, Division of Science Resources Statistics, 2010). Although these early data are only publicly available by gender as a group, it is unlikely that URMs were well represented in these totals considering that no URM group earned more than 2% of engineering doctoral degrees in 2009-10 (NSF, Division of Science Resource Statistics, 2010). These data are even more disturbing when parsed by gender and race. In 2009-10, Hispanic men earned the most doctoral degrees out of all URM groups in engineering, with 149 degrees, while Native American women earned the fewest at only 5 (ASEE College Profiles and Statistics, 2011). Since these data represent such small totals, this study will not specifically examine race by gender. This study will, however, analyze the group that is most underrepresented within the 'women' group category, which includes those with U.S. citizenship or permanent residency status. In 2010, engineering schools reporting data to the ASEE awarded 885 doctorate degrees to women with U.S. citizenship or permanent residency status (ASEE College Profiles and Statistics, 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Educational Pathway Perspective", "text": "This study focuses on advanced engineering degree production in an effort to determine factors that relate to degree production among the group of individuals who are most likely to advance engineering research and serve as educators in the highly in-demand engineering field (Freehill et al., 2008;National Academies, 2007;The Woodrow Wilson Foundation, 2005;Varma & Freehill, 2010). It is important to recognize the postsecondary educational pathway for URMs and women who later earn doctorate degrees in engineering. The Commission on the Future of Graduate Education in the U.S. broadly defines 'pathway' related to a graduate degree as a structure where someone enters the pathway with a bachelor's degree and eventually ends with a doctoral degree. An emphasis is placed on the idea that individuals may enter the pathway at multiple points and at multiple times (Wendler et al., 2010). A bachelor's degree is the first step in the postsecondary educational pathway to a doctorate degree (NSF, Division of Science Resources Statistics, 2010;Wendler et al., 2010). URMs and women with U.S. citizenship or permanent residency status earn higher rates of engineering degrees at the bachelor's-level than at the doctorate-level, although they only earned close to 12% and 16% of bachelor 's, respectively, in 2009-10 (ASEE College Profiles andStatistics, 2011). A host of 'baccalaureate origin' studies and reports analyze institutional characteristics related to women and URM degree production among those with bachelor's degrees who eventually earned doctoral degrees (Brazziel & Brazziel 1997;Cooper, 2004;NSF, Division of Science Resources Statistics, 2011;Salters, 1997;Solorzano, 1995;Wolf-Wendel, 1998). These studies serve as a way for institutions to know where to recruit students, and they help institutional policy makers and recruiters better understand how these undergraduate institutions encouraged degree success and the pursuit of a doctoral program. As is often the case in research on advanced education, literature tends to relate research to a bachelor's degree first, since more students attend college at the undergraduate-level, and it is the first step in the pathway to an advanced degree (Kallio, 1995;McAnulty, 2009;Poock & Love, 2001). Specifically in the field of engineering, Freehill et al. (2008) emphasized that studies should focus on institutions that successfully recruit and retain URMs at the undergraduate-level, because less successful institutions should look to more successful ones as a model. While these baccalaureate origin studies are somewhat useful for engineering doctoral degree programs to determine where to recruit underrepresented students, over two-thirds of individuals with engineering doctorates earn a master's degree en route (NSF, Division of Science Resources Statistics, 2010). Roughly 70% of engineering doctorate recipients in 2009 earned a master's degree in engineering. This was the highest rate among all fields that granted doctoral degrees in the U.S. When examined by race, blacks and those that identified themselves as two or more races earned the highest engineering master's degrees among all engineering doctorate recipients in 2009, with each attaining approximately 72% and 75%, respectively. Men and women with doctorate degrees held master's degrees at about the same rate; and, doctorate degree holders in civil engineering held the highest percentage of prior master's degrees among those who earned engineering doctorates in 2009, at close to 90% (NSF, Division of Science Resources Statistics, 2010). The high rate at which civil engineering doctorate degree holders earn master's degrees could be the result of changes to licensure in 1995 that required engineers to obtain at least 30 credit hours beyond the bachelor's degree (Russell, Rogers, Lenox, & Coward, 2011). Updates in civil engineering licensing requirements cannot solely account for the nearly 100% increase in master's degree attainment in engineering in the U. S. between 1977 and 2008, as only 10% of this increase occurred in the last 10 years (NSF, National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, 2011;Wendler et al., 2010). The increase in the rate of master's degrees over the last forty years might explain why some researchers have started to examine the role of institutional environments at the master's degree level, similar to how research explores the role of the environment of a student's baccalaureate institution. Studies that examine the impact of environments on a student's master's degree education argue that individuals within colleges and universities influence students at this level, similar to how faculty, administrators, and peers shape experiences for students at the undergraduate-level (Lange, 2006;Leslie, McClure, & Oaxaca, 1998;Nettles & Millett, 2006;Stassun, Burger, & Lange, 2010). One groundbreaking study by Lange (2006) examined data from nearly 3,200 STEM doctoral degree recipients from the NSF's Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) between 1998 and 2002. Lange reported that URMs were more likely to obtain a master's degree on the path toward the doctorate. She connected this finding to the importance that a master's degree plays in linking students to an institution at the graduate-level, and that those students who gain a master's degree along the way to a doctorate may be better socialized to subsequently complete a In engineering, studies have shown that doctoral students with a master's degree are more likely to earn a Ph.D., and that they earn it at a faster rate than those who begin a doctoral program without one (Nettles & Millett, 2006;Most, 2008). Most (2008) found that students were more likely to obtain a Ph.D. in certain fields if they held a master's degree. Most examined 1989Most examined -1997 doctoral completion data from the AAU and Association of Graduate Schools' longitudinal database titled the \"Project for Research on Doctoral Education.\" This analysis included data from nearly 5,000 doctoral students in 10 fields at 16 different colleges and universities. In the field of mechanical engineering, Most found that only around 20% of students without a master's degree had completed a doctoral degree within nine years, whereas nearly 50% with a master's degree had completed a doctoral degree in this time frame. Nettles & Millett (2006), in their study of approximately 9,000 doctoral students who completed surveys about their experiences as a student in 1996, also found that engineering doctoral students decreased their time to degree when they held a master's degree. The high rate at which engineering doctorate recipients earn a master's en route to a doctorate indicates that the master's degree is the next step in the educational pathway for engineering students, yet a master's degree is often skipped over in the STEM doctoral 'pathway' conversation. The high rate at which engineering doctorate recipients earn master's degrees en route to a doctorate means that engineering schools potentially have a pool beyond the bachelor's degree from which to recruit qualified students into doctoral programs. Lange's (2006) research indicates that engineering doctorate recipients are more likely to stay at the same school for their master's and doctorate degree; however, URMs in STEM are more likely to attend different institutions for their master's and doctorate degree. This study compares an engineering school's production of master's and doctorate degrees for underrepresented groups in an effort to better understand if the same schools produce high degree rates for both advanced degree levels. Further, this study's examination of specific engineering school characteristics that relate to higher advanced degree rates for underrepresented groups provides an additional layer for administrators and policy makers to utilize when determining how to best recruit underrepresented students into engineering doctoral degree programs. The education production function and theory of institutional capital were used as this study's framework to examine (1) which engineering schools produced the highest advanced degree rates for underrepresented groups and (2) which engineering school characteristics relate to higher advanced degree rates for URMs and women. The next section details this framework and applies it to institutional graduate degree production rates in engineering for URMs and women."}, {"section_title": "Conceptual Framework", "text": "This study's framework is based on: (1) the education production function and (2) the theory of institutional capital. The education production function provided the overarching statistical model for this study, and the theory of institutional capital served as the conceptual foundation from which the variables in this study were identified. Aspects of the education production function were partially drawn from doctoral degree production studies by Hartwig (1978) and Shelton & Prabhakar (1971), who examined degree production in engineering, and Wolf-Wendel et al. 2000, who analyzed outcomes in the education field. The theory of institutional capital was modeled off of studies that connected institutional capital to educational outcomes in the field of accounting, medicine, and law (Brosnan, 2010;Fogarty, 1997;Jewel, 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Education Production Function", "text": "Researchers have used the production function to examine efficiencies at all levels of education, including those specifically related to Ph.D. production for women or Ph.D. production in engineering (Dundar & Lewis, 1995;Hanushek, 1979;Hartwig, 1978;Hubbard & Stage, 2010;Monk, 1989;Shelton & Prabhakar, 1971;Titus, 2009;Wolf-Wendel et al., 2000). According to Hanushek (1979), the production function refers to an efficiency model that examined the: \"\u2026correct choice of input mix given the prices of inputs\" and \"\u2026[the maximization of] an output for a given set of inputs\" (p. 369-370). He argued that the best way to examine the production function is by analyzing data in a specific area, because decision-makers may use the results to make funding decisions that may not accurately reflect efficiency across all areas in an organization. Hopkins (1990) also argued that the most useful production function examinations occur on smaller scales (versus across an entire university), because of the complex variables associated with higher education outcomes. Although a variety of variables can be used to describe inputs and outputs in higher education, Hopkins described overarching inputs as capital (i.e., resources) and faculty. While there are also a host of educational outputs to possibly examine in education, Hopkins identified degree production as one of the main outcomes. Thus, it is appropriate to use the production function to examine M.S. and Ph.D. degree production rates connected to a specific field, such as engineering. In engineering, Hartwig (1978) and Shelton & Prabhakar (1971)  examination of data between 1956 and 1976, and used faculty size and average time to degree as input measures, and research expenditures plus enrollment and degree statistics at the baccalaureate, master's, and doctoral-levels as output variables. Both studies highlighted the importance of the variable that is used for the denominator in efficiency ratios, where an efficiency ratio is the result of dividing an output or resource by a certain input or resource. Although larger programs produced more degrees and sponsored research, smaller programs produced baccalaureate degrees at higher rates per faculty member than larger ones in Shelton & Prabhakar's analysis. Shelton & Prabhakar suggested that this rate may indicate that smaller schools focus more on teaching than research and graduate programs. Hartwig found that larger institutions spent about half as much to produce a Ph.D. degree per faculty research expenditure than smaller ones. While both of these studies provide a framework for variables to examine when analyzing Ph.D. production in engineering programs, neither considered production rates for underrepresented groups. A study by Wolf-Wendel et al. (2000) demonstrates how the education production function can be used to examine Ph.D. production for women by race. This study combined the education production function with the theory of baccalaureate origins to analyze individual and institutional-level data from the Doctorate Records File for African American, white, and Latina women who earned baccalaureate degrees in 1965 and subsequently gained doctorates by 1975. The purpose of the study was to determine which institutional-level resources (amount spent on instruction per student and endowment dollars per student) contributed to the production of doctoral degrees for different groups of women. After controlling for institutional expenditures per student, the researchers found that women with doctorates earned more baccalaureate degrees at women's colleges, Hispanic Serving Institution (HSIs), or HBCUs. Further, these researchers found that women's colleges, HSIs, and HBCUs produced more baccalaureate degrees for women doctorate degree holders for each dollar spent on institutional resources. Thus, these colleges were more productive and efficient at producing baccalaureate degrees for women who later earned doctorates by 1975, and they did so with fewer resources. Wolf-Wendel et al.'s (2000) study demonstrates how the education production function can be coupled with a guiding framework to examine Ph.D. production for underrepresented groups by institutions. Hanushek (1979) cautioned that researchers should not rely solely on the production function as a conceptual framework, because the theory involves a variety of complex inputs, and studies should use a guiding framework to derive measures for inputs and outputs. This study addresses this criticism by using the theory of institutional capital as a lens from which to examine variables in the education production function model."}, {"section_title": "Institutional Capital Theory", "text": "Researchers have applied Bourdieu's (1984) theory of capital to outcomes in the fields of law, medicine, and accounting (Brosnan, 2010;Fogarty, 1997;Jewel, 2008). Bourdieu is well known for his research on the concept of capital, which he generally applies to how individual capital, such as background, class, and socioeconomic status affect practices within different cultures. Bourdieu has also applied capital to explain differences between 'fields,' such as higher education. Bourdieu used higher education as an example of a field which contains different forms of capital, including those related to cultural, economic, and symbolic forms. He argued that a variety of 'actors' compete for cultural, economic, and symbolic resources within these fields. These 'actors' feel a continued need to evaluate their placement in the competitive field and strive to gain resources that allow them to reposition their value. Bourdieu contended that a focus on a particular field allows researchers to understand the context from which individuals in these institutions develop their goals and strategies (Bourdieu & Wacquant, 1992). Brosnan (2010), Fogarty (1997), andJewel (2008) focused on Bourdieu's concept of 'field' in their analysis of how various actors compete for resources and outcomes in the fields of medicine, law, and accounting. Brosnan's examination of medical institutions and Jewel's analysis of law schools are particularly useful as examples from which to view the theory of institutional capital because both fields have made gains in the representation of women, as pointed out by Wendler et al. (2010): \"Substantial shifts have been seen in the traditionally male fields of law and medicine, with women now comprising about half the enrollment in these professional programs, but it is unclear whether these shifts will be replicated in currently maledominated fields such as engineering\" (p. 8). Duderstadt (2010) suggests that law and medical fields have been able to achieve these parities because of curricular modifications that require undergraduates to earn degrees in liberal arts based fields. While this argument might apply to the general field of engineering, students with degrees in the chemical engineering field, for example, often pursue medical or law school after earning a bachelor's degree (Brawner et al., 2011). Thus, a broad baccalaureate education cannot be the only factor that attracts underrepresented students into the law and medical fields. Researchers in the law and medical fields have shown that certain resources or institutional capital affect outcomes in their fields. Since these fields have made significant ground in attracting underrepresented groups into their programs, they can be used as a model for a similar study of engineering school resources. One place to start this analysis for engineering graduate programs is to examine how researchers in the law and medical fields applied institutional capital to degree outcomes in these programs. Researchers in the law, medical, and accounting fields identified cultural, economic, and symbolic capital as resources that determined overall capital in each field, which they connected to overarching 'institutional' capital in their studies. The specific definition for each form of institutional capital varied by researcher, although they generally agreed that cultural capital represented historical advantages and often connected their field's purpose to this form, economic capital as those financial resources that contribute to a specific outcome in a field, and symbolic capital to features that influence the perception of a field. While these three forms of capital represent different resources that institutions attain, it is important to recognize that each resource could affect the perception of the other and that the forms of capital can overlap. As Smart (1993) points out, \"It should be clear\u2026that Bourdieu discusses the forms of capital in ways that overlap...\" (p.393). This overlap is evident in the different ways in which researchers applied Bourdieu's theory of capital to outcomes in accounting, law, and medicine (Brosnan, 2010;Jewel, 2008;Fogarty, 1997). In an effort to determine how to possibly categorize engineering school characteristics as a specific form of institutional capital, the following sections discuss institutional capital definitions as characterized by Brosnan, Jewel, and Fogarty. These definitions are applied to the forms of institutional capital used to examine engineering graduate degree rates in this study, which included variables associated with institutional type, program size, research expenditures, institutional prestige, and program demographics. Each section concludes with a general definition for how institutional capital fits into the various forms of capital applied to an engineering school."}, {"section_title": "Cultural capital.", "text": "An institution's cultural capital can be viewed for how its purpose relates to educational outcomes (Brosnan, 2010;Fogarty, 1997;Jewel, 2008). Researchers interpret cultural capital differently, depending on the field and outcome addressed. For example, Fogarty (1997), who analyzed accounting doctoral degree and job placement data from 70 institutions, connected an institution's role to produce knowledge with research expenditures. On the other hand, Jewel (2008), who reviewed extensive amounts of literature to show how individual and institutional capital applied to law school and the legal profession, linked cultural capital to curriculum, which she identified as a construct to rank students. Further yet, Brosnan (2010), who examined how medical schools in the United Kingdom position themselves from other institutions, related a school's cultural capital to its position in Good University Guide in The Times, because it represented \"\u2026the 'right' sort of knowledge\u2026 to be a 'good' school\" (p. 649). This guide ranks schools on research quality, admission standards, satisfaction of students, and prospects of graduates. Although all three studies examined cultural capital slightly differently, they each related a program's purpose to educate students or produce knowledge, which are key aspects in an institution's mission (Scott, 2006). Institutional missions differ by the category in which an institution falls. The mission of a private college differs from that of a public institution, just as the mission of an historically underrepresented or women's college differs from other institutions (Scott, 2006). Several studies explore institutional type at the baccalaureate-level for how students' undergraduate institution affects their future decision to pursue a doctorate degree in science and engineering. These studies often examine data by a college's underrepresented classification, such as an institution's classification as an HBCU, HSI, or tribal college (Brazziel & Brazziel 1997;Cooper, 2004;Freehill et al., 2008;Solorzano, 1995). While these studies are useful to Another way to categorize institutions by type is to examine their role in the Association of American Universities (AAU). The AAU is an organization of invited institutions that: (1) are leaders in the advancement of knowledge that play a significant role in fueling the country's defenses, financial markets, and overall interests; (2) works with member universities and the government to tackle governmental and institutional concerns confronting member and nonmember institutions; and, (3) collaborates with the federal government and research institutions to produce studies related to important policy matters and maintain communications between the two entities (AAU, About AAU, 2010). As far back as 1975, researchers recognized the efforts of AAU institutions to graduate higher rates of women and URMs with doctoral degrees (McCarthy & Wolfle, 1975). While these efforts initially stemmed from an institution's need to recruit diverse faculty to comply with Affirmative Action laws, the practice of AAU institutions to produce the majority of doctorates each year has persisted over time. Institutions in the AAU produce the majority of doctorate degrees in the U.S. today (AAU, Facts and Figures, 2010;Nettles & Millet, 2006). Engineering programs grant even more degrees from AAU schools than most fields. In 2008, AAU institutions granted roughly 60% of all engineering doctorate degrees (AAU Facts and Figures, 2010). In 2009-10, all but ten of the top 26, and three of the top 27 institutions that granted doctoral degrees in engineering to URMs and non-foreign women, respectively, held AAU status (ASEE, Engineering College Profiles and Statistics, 2011). Doctoral degree production is closely related to an institution's ability to compete for external research funding, and AAU institutions typically vie for a significant amount of federal funding to produce research to solve important problems facing the country and world. Some of this funding is used to support doctoral students being trained as future leaders in science and engineering fields (AAU, FY12 Appropriations, 2011). While this study is not able to examine the financial support offered to individual graduate students in engineering, it is important to recognize that financial support is a significant factor in a student's decision to attend and complete a doctoral degree in engineering. An institution's ability -characterized as its status in the AAU -to provide this support should be considered when examining doctoral degree production for women and URMs (Barnes & Wells, 2009;Freehill et al., 2008;Nettles & Millett, 2006). It is an institution's ability to produce an engineering doctorate degree that this study most closely connects to cultural capital, even though it is recognized that institutional demographics could also represent the perceived advantage an institution maintains over time. This study discusses institutional demographics in the context of a perception or symbolic resource for how they relate to an underrepresented student's perception of an engineering school, which is why it is discussed in the symbolic capital section."}, {"section_title": "Cultural capital in this study.", "text": "An institution's ability to provide resources for doctoral education is in line with Brosnan 2010, Fogarty (1997), and Jewel's (2008) assertions that cultural capital develops over time and connects to a university's purpose to produce knowledge. Thus, this study examined an institution's AAU status as a cultural capital variable, in order to connect an institution's research mission to produce an advanced degree for an underrepresented group with its primary purpose and financial ability to do so."}, {"section_title": "Economic capital.", "text": "Even among AAU institutions, colleges and universities differ greatly by size and resources, which researchers have identified as variables that affect an institution's doctoral degree productivity (Breneman, 1970;Hanushek, 1979;Hartwig, 1978;Shelton & Prabhakar, 1971;Wolf-Wendel et al., 2000). Economic capital can be used to examine how financial resources and program size -as key factors in a program's ability to fund academic programsinfluence degree productivity (Brosnan, 2010;Fogarty, 1997;Hartwig, 1978;Jewel, 2008). While researchers generally agree that economic capital represents specific financial resources required to accomplish certain outcomes in a field, previous researchers examined economic capital in different ways. While Brosnan (2010) and Jewel (2008) related the role of funding to a program's rank in a national publication, Fogarty (1997) and Hartwig (1978)  higher ranked programs increased the likelihood of gaining employment because of the resources they were able to spend to earn a degree from a highly ranked law school. On the other hand, Fogarty (1997) contended that a program's economic capital relates to its size, and that larger programs tend to be more visible and require higher financial support levels. He used the number of doctoral graduates, full-time staff members, baccalaureate degrees, and annual Certified Public Accounting (CPA) candidates as size variables in his analysis of doctoral accounting graduate placements. Hartwig's (1978) analysis of the production of engineering programs also connected size, defined as the number of full-time faculty, students enrolled at the bachelor's, master's, and doctoral-level, and total research expenditures, to degree production. Hartwig An engineering school's research expenditures can also be examined in light of how these funds relate to Ph.D. degree production. In 2008-09, eight out of the top 10 engineering schools in total research expenditures produced the highest levels of Ph.D. graduates; however, only two of the same institutions appeared in the top 10 when expenditures per doctoral student were examined (Gibbons, 2009). Further, the NSF and ASEE utilize a school's research completion project data indicates that smaller engineering cohorts, which contained 1 to 7 students, completed Ph.D. degrees at higher rates than those from medium or large groups. Medium groups consisted of 8 to 14 students, while large were 15 or more (Ph.D. Completion Project, Analysis of Baseline Data, 2007). These findings are in line with Bowen & Rudenstine's (1992) groundbreaking book, In Pursuit of the Ph.D., where they found that programs with smaller student cohorts in economics, history, political science, English, physics, and math all completed Ph.D. programs at higher rates compared to those with larger entering student cohorts."}, {"section_title": "Economic capital in this study.", "text": "Although researchers disagree about which variables to analyze as economic concepts, and which side of the production function equation these variables fall, Shelton & Prabhakar (1971) argue that different variables may be considered as either inputs or outputs in an analysis of production. Therefore, economic capital in this study was generally based off of: (1) a combination of Brosnan (2010), Fogarty (1997), and Jewel's (2008) concepts of economic capital applied to outcomes in their studies, (2) Hartwig's use of student cohort size and research expenditures as input measures in his examination of engineering degree productions, and (3) the importance that national agencies attach to research expenditures. The economic capital aspects that this study explored included average annual engineering research expenditures and average annual engineering graduate program enrollment."}, {"section_title": "Symbolic capital.", "text": "An examination of the production of engineering graduate degrees should also consider how an institution's symbolic features affect degree rates. Unlike cultural and economic capital, researchers generally agree that prestige variables -as key factors in the perception of an 'actor' in a certain 'field' -comprise an institution's symbolic capital (Brosnan, 2010;Fogarty, 1997;Jewel, 2008). Nevertheless, researchers used slightly different variables to define 'prestige' in their various studies. Fogarty (1997) linked symbolic capital to an accounting doctoral student's ability to work with highly productive faculty because of the prestige a program gains from its selectivity. In the case of Fogarty's study, this meant that graduates from higher ranked programs were expected to obtain academic positions at higher rates, which is exactly what he found. Jewel (2008) connected symbolic capital to institutional rank, such as that in U.S. News & World Report, because higher ranked institutions were able to recruit better applicants. Brosnan (2010) also placed great emphasis on the symbolic capital that rankings bring to the competitiveness of a program. Symbolic capital in her study was measured as a school's rank in The Times' 'Good University Guide,' where a higher rank was associated with higher prestige. Brosnan also supported her analysis with interviews with 37 students and 15 faculty members about their viewpoints regarding the curriculum at two medical schools. Results from Brosnan's analyses indicated that more clinician-scientists (compared to just clinicians) graduated from higher ranked institutions, which connected to that institution's focus on science, in addition to medical education. Ranking guides, such as U.S. News & World Report (USNWR), often serve as resources to assess an institution's prestige (Brewer, Gates, & Goldman, 2002;Jin & Walley, 2007;Meredith, 2004;Sauder & Espeland, 2006;Sweitzer & Volkwein, 2009;Volkwein & Sweitzer, 2005). An engineering graduate program's rank in USNWR is based on an assessment of quality, student selectivity, faculty resources, and research activity. The quality score is comprised of scores on a scale of 1 to 5 from both peers and recruiters. The number of doctoral degrees awarded, faculty to student ratios, and the percentage of faculty in the National Academy of Engineering make up the faculty resources score. Total research expenditures and research expenditures per faculty member frame the research activity score. Student selectivity scores are based on acceptance rates and mean quantitative Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores (Morse & Flanigan, 2009). Entrance exam scores often serve as a key proxy that connects student quality to a program's rank in USNWR, which is one of the most recognized 'prestige' ranking publications in the U.S. (Brewer et al., 2002;Jin & Walley, 2007;Meredith, 2004;Sauder & Espeland, 2006;Sweitzer & Volkwein, 2009;Volkwein & Sweitzer, 2005). The most common entrance exam for graduate school is the GRE (\"About the GRE,\" 2011). Most engineering doctorate programs use the GRE as their primary admission exam tool, despite findings that indicate it may not be the best predictor of success for women and URMs in a graduate program (Lightfoot & Doerner, 2008;Rogers & Molina, 2006). 'Traditional' admission criteria, such as the GRE, have been found to negatively correlate to URM enrollment and retention in graduate programs in fields such as psychology (Rogers & Molina, 2006). Although graduate programs often use the GRE as an admission measurement, a recent study that validated its predictability only parsed data by overarching life sciences, humanities, math-physical sciences, and social sciences groups (Kuncel, Wee, Serafin, & Hezlett 2010). Findings from Nettles & Millett's (2006) study on doctoral completion highlight the importance of aggregating these data by specific field. These authors found that engineering doctoral students were more likely to have higher rates of faculty interaction if they scored higher on the quantitative portion of the GRE. On the other hand, engineering students were less likely to have high interaction rates with faculty if they scored high on the verbal portion of the GRE. No other field had the same opposite effect. Faculty members also maintain demographic characteristics which can be viewed as one component of an institution's level of diversity (\"A Bridge for All\u2026,\" 2004;Chubin et al., 2005;Donnelly & Jacobi, 2010;Freehill, 2005;Zajicek et al., 2011). It is the demographic characteristics that tenured/tenure-track faculty members convey within an engineering school that this study examines, even though it is recognized that faculty members contribute economic capital through academic, research, and service-related responsibilities (Schuster & Finkelstein, 2006). Further, faculty demographics could serve as a proxy of an institution's cultural capital, if their diversity (or lack of) is viewed as an institution's historical advantage to attract certain groups of students to their institution. It is within the institutional prestige context in which faculty variables are generally discussed in this study. HBCUs have been shown to produce nearly one-third of the bachelor's degrees for blacks who later earn doctorates in science and engineering (Burrelli & Rapoport, 2008). A unique feature that HBCUs offer is that they employ a higher percentage of black science and engineering faculty members than traditionally white institutions (TWIs) (Clewell, de Cohen, & Tsui, 2010). Research shows, however, that more diverse institutions are often perceived as less prestigious institutions (Brewer et al., 2002). Underrepresented faculty members perform an important role in the degree production of women and URMs in STEM programs at the baccalaureate and graduate-level (Nettles & Millett, 2006;Ong et al., 2011;Price, 2010;Sonnert et al., 2007). For example, Price (2010), in a recent analysis of faculty effects on persistence in STEM fields, found that minority faculty positively influenced persistence of minority undergraduates pursuing STEM degrees. Although this same study found no significant effect for women faculty on women's persistence, Sonnert et al., in their examination of women students enrolled in science and engineering programs at Research I universities, and the percentage of women faculty at these institutions between 1984 and 2000, found that institutions with higher percentages of women undergraduates -the first step in the pathway to a doctorate degree -also had higher percentages of women science and engineering faculty members. Further, although Nettles & Millett (2006) found that few women or URMs had same sex or race advisors in engineering doctoral programs, when possible, these students had same gender or race mentors. The authors attributed this finding to the idea that students have a greater chance of being able to select mentors outside of their major. The main problem in engineering is that there are too few women or URM faculty from which to assign doctoral students the same sex or race advisors or mentors. This study also found that women were less satisfied with their interactions with faculty, which the authors attributed to the continuance of an \"old boys club\" (p. 218) mentality in engineering programs. Similarly, Ong et al. (2011), in their examination of over 100 articles on minority women in STEM undergraduate and graduate programs, found that very few minority women received the mentorship or encouragement needed from faculty during the admission or graduate career process. One aspect of Nettles & Millet's (2006) comprehensive study on doctoral degree completion also focused on how peer interactions by gender and race related to the doctoral socialization process. They found no differences between minorities and whites in any field; however, men in engineering had fewer interactions with peers than women. This socialization process is not limited to fellow doctoral students. Important peer interactions also take place between undergraduate and graduate students (Wilson et al., 2011). While Wilson and others highlighted the importance of a diverse graduate student body on undergraduate retention in STEM fields, in a recent analysis of IPEDS data of graduate students enrolled in STEM programs across institutions in the U.S. during 2006, results revealed that STEM graduate programs, on average, enrolled higher percentages of URMs when they also enrolled higher percentages of URMs at the undergraduate-level (Ostreko, 2010)."}, {"section_title": "Symbolic capital in this study.", "text": "Peer and faculty demographics, GRE scores, graduate admission yield, and a program's rank in USNWR could all serve as signals of an institution's prestige; and, Brosnan (2010), Fogarty (1997), andJewel (2008) suggest that 'prestige' is the main form of an institution's symbolic capital. Since underrepresented groups may use any or all of these 'prestige' signals in their decision to attend and earn an engineering graduate degree from an institution, this study discussed prestige as the gender or ethnicity of underrepresented undergraduates and master'slevel students, gender or ethnicity of underrepresented tenured/tenure-track faculty members, average GRE score, graduate admission yield, and USNWR rank. This section discussed how symbolic, economic, and cultural capital might be applied to resources in an engineering school. Based on studies that applied these forms of capital to academic programs in accounting, law, and medicine, this section explored possible ways to apply capital to an engineering school, with the recognition that capital could overlap depending on how the resource is examined.

The degree production ratios were partially modeled off of previous studies that used the education production function. These studies include those by Hartwig (1978), Shelton & Prabhakar (1971), and Wolf-Wendel et al. (2000). The degree production rate formula was generally defined as the percentage of engineering graduate degrees earned by an underrepresented group out of all engineering graduate degrees granted at an institution. Eight total dependent variables were analyzed. These examinations included an analysis of (1) master's and doctorate degree rates for URMs and women by top producing engineering schools and (2) an examination of the relationship between engineering school characteristics and advanced degree production rates for underrepresented groups. Data for degree productions were obtained from an engineering school's figures listed in the \"Graduate\" section of \"Degrees Awarded by Program\" in the ASEE's Engineering College Profiles and Statistics database for the years 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009  Data obtained from ASEE, College Profiles and Statistics, 2005. year-to-year over a period of five years, and that individual engineering schools might report very different degree totals each year, this study used five-year averages for degree totals.\nMaster's and doctoral degree production rates were calculated for URMs and women, where URMs included blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans, and women included all women with U.S. citizenship or permanent residency status. Table 4 details the mean, standard deviation, and final data set size for each dependent variable that examined which schools produced the highest advanced degree rates This analysis resulted in a total of 163 institutions in the master's and 75 institutions in the doctoral group for URMs, and 185 institutions in the master's and 126 institutions in the doctoral group for women. Table 5 shows that engineering schools included in the final regression models resulted in 97 institutions in the master's and 63 institutions in the doctoral group for URMs, and 126 institutions in the master's and 109 institutions in the doctoral group for women. Table 4 shows that the engineering schools in this study that granted at least 1 master's degree or 1 doctoral degree to URMs between 2005 and 2009, on average, awarded 7% of all master's and 5% of all doctoral degrees to URMs. The lowest producing schools awarded 0% at the M.S.-level and 1% at the Ph.D.-level, and the highest producing schools awarded nearly 52% at the master's and 47% at the doctoral-level. The standard deviations, or average difference between degree production rates for URMs in engineering schools, were about the same as the means for both the master's and doctoral degree-levels, at 8% and 6%, respectively. Table 5 shows that engineering schools in the final regression models also reported around the same rates of master's and doctoral degrees for URMs as those in the overall URM groups. Schools included in the regression model examinations awarded 5% of all master's and 4% of all doctoral degrees to URMs, with the fewest producing close to 1% at both levels, and the most producing nearly 32% at the master's and 9% at the doctoral-level. The standard deviations, or average difference between degree production rates for URMs in engineering schools, were quite low for both the master's and doctoral degree-levels, at 4% and 2%, respectively. Tables 4 and 5 also show that all engineering schools that granted at least 1 master's degree or 1 doctoral degree to women between 2005 and 2009 engineering schools, on average, awarded 14% of all master's and 10% of all doctoral degrees to women, with the fewest producing close to 1% at the master's and 3% at the doctoral-level, and the most producing nearly 33% at both levels. The standard deviations, or average difference between degree production rates for women in engineering schools, were also quite low for both the master's and doctoral degree-levels, at 6% and 5%, respectively. The only differences between the schools included in the initial analysis and the regression model analysis were for the standard deviation for the M.S. women group, where those in the institutional capital group reported a 1% greater standard deviation and close to 13% higher rate of master's degrees awarded to women. An analysis of geographical pattern for the top producing engineering schools for URMs with master's and doctoral degrees revealed that the South, East, and in particular, schools in the Southeast produced the highest rates of engineering master's and doctoral degrees for URMs. Although location was not analyzed as one of the independent variables in the education production function, this finding is worth further discussion because of how it could relate to an institution's ability to attract URMs to its engineering graduate degree programs. Since HBCUs often produce higher percentages of blacks who later earn doctorate degrees in STEM fields (Burrelli & Rapaport, 2008), the location of HBCUs is one way to further examine an engineering school's advanced degree production rate for URMs. Figures 2 and 3 show that many of the top producing schools were located in or adjacent to states with HBCUs. Tables 6   and 7 also summarize URM population data for the states in which the top schools are located. Further, many of the same schools produced the highest rates of advanced degrees at both the master's and doctoral-level for URMs. Tables 6-9 show that 11 of the 24 -or close to halfof the same schools in the 'top' groups for advanced engineering degree production rates for URMs produced the highest rates at both the master's and doctoral degree-level.   Figures 4 and 5 show the location patterns for engineering schools that produced the highest rates of advanced degrees for women. Although the location patterns were not as pronounced for women as they were for the URM groups, many of the most productive schools were either located in the Southeast or along the coast.  Similar to the URM group, many of the same schools produced the highest rates of advanced degrees at both the master's and doctoral-level for women. Tables 8 and 9 show that 5 of the 12 in the master's group and 5 of the 13 in the doctoral group -or close to 40% -of the same schools in the 'top' groups for advanced engineering degree production rates for women produced the highest rates at both the master's and doctoral degree-level. Table 8 shows that nearly all of the top schools that produced high rates of master's degrees for women awarded a doctorate degree as the highest engineering degree offered. Tables 8 and 9 also show that top producing schools tended to enroll higher percentages of women undergraduate students, and 9 of the top schools for doctorate degree rates enrolled at least 20% of women at the master's degree-level. Tables in the appendix summarize the top schools by the remaining institutional capital variables. Although most of the top schools reported enrollment data on women, many of them contained missing data for other institutional capital variables. The institutional capital information that was reported is summarized in the tables in the appendix. Highlighted school = top producer in both women degree production rate models  reported an average enrollment of close to 600 doctoral students. Standard deviations were similar for most of the groups, with each reporting average differences in the 400s. The M.S. URM group differences were slightly less at closer to 300. Results for the symbolic capital variables included those for graduate admission yield, USNWR rank, average quantitative GRE score, percentage of undergraduates and master's students enrolled by respective underrepresented group, and percentage of tenured/tenure-track faculty members by underrepresented group. Table 11 shows that, on average, between 43% and 45% of students granted admission into a graduate program enrolled at that institution, with the standard deviation for each group being close to 10%. While most schools reported USNWR rank in the 60s, the Ph.D. URM group reported slightly higher ranks at closer to 50. Each group reported similar differences between USNWR ranks at close to 40 positions between ranks each. Average quantitative GRE scores were quite high, with all reporting averages in the 740s, with averages differing by around 20 points each. All schools held a rather low average for the percentage of either URMs or women among tenured/tenure-track faculty, and none of the averages exceeded 12%. None of the standard deviations for the percentages of underrepresented tenured/tenure-track faculty exceeded 5%, which means that fewer schools reported extreme differences than the averages listed in the table. Averages for the percentage of underrepresented undergraduate students were slightly higher, with the URM group reporting 11% and the women group 19%. Neither group reported more than an 8% for the standard deviation, which indicates that very few schools held extreme values for these variables. The Ph.D. women group reported even higher averages for the percentage of women enrolled at the master's-level at close to 25%. On the other hand, the URM Ph.D. group reported a lower percentage of master's URM students enrolled than undergraduates at close to 7%. Standard deviations for the percentage of underrepresented master's students enrolled for both the URM and women group were relatively low at 3% and 11%, respectively.  Together, these descriptive findings suggest that there are more similarities between each group than there are differences. That is, the engineering schools in each group in the final data set maintained similar engineering school characteristics. While tables 10 and 11 include statistics for all of the engineering schools included in the analysis of advanced degree production rates in the regression models, an examination of top schools for each group also provides a further indication of possible engineering school characteristics that could hold significance in the final regression models. The next section details the remaining four dependent variable groups and highlights the engineering schools that produced the highest rates of master's or doctoral degrees for URMs and women among those that were included in the regression model analyses."}, {"section_title": "Independent Variables", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Cultural capital definition", "text": "Based on Brosnan (2010), Fogarty (1997), and Jewel's (2008) suggestion that cultural capital develops over time and connects to a university's purpose to produce knowledge, the general cultural capital variable in this study included an institution's AAU status.

This included the economic capital variables: program enrollment and research expenditures. This practice is in line with the use of averages for multiple data points (Johnson & Christensen, 2000). The use of multiple years of data also helped to address potential problems with graduate student absences from year-to-year. It is common for graduate students to leave programs temporarily for a short period of time (CGS' Website, 2010). These absences, often referred to as leaves of absences (LOA), are not reported in enrollment statistics. The use of a five-year average, rather than an enrollment snap shot, provided a better indication of an institution's typical graduate student enrollment. After adding IPEDS IDs to the ASEE data, institutions were first kept in the analysis if they offered a doctorate degree as their highest offering. IPEDS IDs were also added to the USNWR's ranks, quantitative GRE scores, and AAU listing of schools.

These logs were used in the final regression model analyses . Tables of the distributions of the independent variables before and after log conversions are included in the appendix.

Miles  ). There is a chance that an individual reporting data may misinterpret or misreport the information. The use of five years of data helps to account for skewed data reported in a specific year. Further, much of the information reported to the ASEE is also reported in USNWR. This includes information on admission, enrollment, institutional type, Carnegie classification, degrees, and research expenditures. The ability to check data in both sources helped to verify its accuracy. Institutions must also pay to participate in ASEE's annual survey collection. While most engineering schools participate in this survey collection, some schools may choose not to provide information because of the funding required to do so (ASEE, College Profiles, 2010). Since ASEE, USNWR, and IPEDS data are collected annually, researchers and institutions are able to take advantage of relatively recent data; however, the early timeline for collecting data each year means that some programs or institutions may not have finalized data at the end of the collection period. These data sources allow institutions to submit updated data; although, the number of institutions that submitted changes is not reported. This limitation is not Further, some schools only provided data by gender and reported all totals in the \"unknown\" category. Since these data were not able to be identified by specific ethnic group, they were not included in the URM models, even though some reported large totals for graduate degrees. Graduate degree rates were also only examined for schools that IPEDS identified as granting a doctorate as the highest degree offered. Since this 'institutional' classification does not necessarily mean that an 'engineering' school grants at least a doctorate degree, some schools could have remained in the model even if the engineering program only granted a master's as the highest degree. In order to account for this limitation, the highest engineering degree offered is examined for schools that resulted in the 'top' list for the percentage of master's degrees awarded to underrepresented groups. Finally, the changing nature of engineering graduate admission requirements must also be taken into consideration. Although it is unlikely that an institution would make significant changes to its admission requirements for a graduate degree program, an institution has the ability to change admission requirements, such as that of a GRE requirement, over time."}, {"section_title": "Summary of Chapter III", "text": "This chapter explained how data from the ASEE, USNWR, IPEDS, and AAU were used to examine institutional capital characteristics related to the graduate degree production for women and URMs in engineering.

The table includes the top 5 engineering schools that produced doctoral degrees for URMs. Since many of the schools maintained the same doctoral degree production rate for URMs, the 'top 5' list includes a total of 25 schools. Overall, an engineering school in the 'top' group awarded around 5% of its doctorate degrees to URMs, which is about 1% higher than the average rate at which all schools produced doctorates for URMs. Table 13 shows that 12 of the top producing schools for URM doctoral degrees held AAU status, which indicates that just less than half of the highest producing institutions are likely to maintain the research funding associated with high doctoral degree productivity. Fewer of the top producing institutions held AAU status, on average, than those in the Ph The GRE ranges for this group were nearly identical to the M.S. group, with the low being 686 and the high at 780. GRE averages between the top and main Ph.D. URM group also remained about the same, with both reporting averages in the 740s. Student and faculty demographic variables also varied widely from a low of 5% for each to a high of 35% of URMs at the undergraduate-level, 3% to 25% at the master's-level, and 2% to 14% of URM tenured/tenure-track faculty; however, the highest underrepresented percentages in this group aligned even better with their degree production rate. For instance, the top producing institution, the University of Miami, had the highest percentages of URM undergraduates and master's level students at 35% and 25%, respectively, and maintained one of the higher rates of URM tenured/tenure-track faculty at 8%. The top producing schools reported the same or very similar averages for demographic variables compared to those in the main Ph.D. URM group, with less than a 2% difference between any of the groups. In addition to the general analysis conducted for each URM group, table 13 highlights those schools that resulted in the 'top producing' model for both the M.S. and Ph.D. groups. This analysis was conducted because the students attending an institution for a master's degree might be the same students who remain at an institution for a doctorate degree, although Lange's (2006)   produced master's degrees for women. Since many of the schools maintained the same master's degree production rate for women, the 'top 10' list includes a total of 22 schools. Overall, an engineering school in the top group awarded around 24% of its master's degrees to women, which is about 10% higher than the average rate at which all schools produced master's degrees for women. 10 of the top producing schools for master's degrees for women held AAU status. This finding suggests that just less than half of the highest producing institutions are likely to obtain the research funding levels associated with high doctoral degree production. This finding was close to the results for all engineering schools in the M.S. women group, where 51 out of the 126 schools, or close to 40%, held AAU status. Average annual research expenditures ranged from around $1.9M to over $13M. Average master's student class sizes ranged from a low of 17 to a high of 2,108. Similar to the URM groups, averages for the economic variables in the top M.S. women group were considerably lower than that for the main M.S. women group. Average annual research expenditures for top engineering schools were close to $15M less than the average for the main M.S. women. Master's program enrollment for engineering schools in the top group averaged close to 175 fewer students than those in the main M.S. women group. Table 14 also shows that many of the prestige-related variables for top producing engineering schools for women with master's degrees also ranged quite widely. The percentage of admitted students who enrolled in a graduate program still ranged widely, although it was much smaller than the URM groups, with a low of 35% and a high of 57%. The average for both groups, though, was nearly identical at close to 45%. Schools also ranged similar to the top URM groups in their rank in USNWR, with a low of 137 and high of 3. Somewhat similar to the URM group comparisons, the average USNWR rank for the top engineering schools producing master's degrees for women held slightly lower ranks with an average of 70 compared to an average of 68 for the main M.S. women group. Average quantitative GRE scores between the top M.S. producing engineering schools for women and the overall group were also about the same with scores in the 740s. Student and faculty demographic variables for this group also varied widely from a low of 13% to a high of 29% of women at the undergraduate-level to a low of 6% and a high of 21% of women tenured/tenure-track faculty, and the highest underrepresented percentages did not necessarily align with the higher producing institutions. For instance, the top producing institution, Tulane University, maintained the highest rate of women undergraduates at 29%, but they had one of the lower rates of women faculty at 8%. Likewise, the Johns Hopkins University, which ranked 9 th on the list of top producing schools for engineering master's degrees for women, reported the percentage of undergraduate women at 28% and women tenured/tenuretrack faculty at 12%. These patterns might reflect the overall and 'top' group averages, which held no difference in the case of the percentage of women tenured/tenure-track faculty, where both reported an average of 12%. There was also only a small difference of around 4% between the main M.S. women group and the top producing group for the percentage of undergraduate women enrolled, where the main group reported averages close to 19% and the top reported closer to 23%. schools that produced doctoral degrees for women. Since many of the schools maintained the same doctoral degree production rate for women, the 'top 10' list includes a total of 20 schools. Overall, an engineering school in the top group awarded around 18% of its doctorate degrees to women, which is about 8% higher than the average rate at which all schools produced doctorates for women. 15 of the top producing schools for doctoral degrees for women held AAU status, which means that 75% of the highest producing institutions maintained a level of research funding likely to support doctoral education. Unlike any other group, this is the only one where this figure exceeded the average for the number of AAU schools in them main group. Only 49 out of 109, or close to 45%, of the engineering schools in the main Ph.D. women group held AAU status. Average annual research expenditures ranged from around $2.5 million to over $240 million. Average doctoral student class sizes ranged from a low of 69 to a high of 1,597. While the averages for the main Ph.D. women group were slightly higher, the differences between the main group and top producing group were considerably less than these differences for each of the other outcome variables. Average annual research expenditures for top engineering schools were close to $5M less than the average for the main Ph.D. women; and, doctoral program enrollment for engineering schools in the top group averaged only 5 fewer students than those in the main Ph.D. women group. Table 15 shows that many of the prestige-related variables for top producing engineering schools for women with doctorate degrees ranged quite widely, although the differences between the main and top producing group were somewhat minimal. The percentage of admitted students who enrolled in a graduate program was again smaller for this group than any of the URMs, with a low of 30% and a high of 63%. The averages between the top producing and main group were both around 45%. While the average difference between USNWR ranks also varied quite widely, the difference between the average in the main group at around 60 and the top group at around 51 was quite small. Schools in the top group ranked in USNWR as low as 126 and as high as 1. This was also the only group where the highest ranked school in USNWR, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), showed up in the top producing group. MIT's engineering doctorate degree production rate for women at 14% was the lowest among the 'top' doctorate degree producing group for women. This was also the only group where the top group held a higher average rank in USNWR than the main group. Average quantitative GRE scores were also very similar between the two groups; and, the score ranges for the top Ph.D. women group were the same as that for the top M.S. women group with a low of 633 and a high of 800. Results for student and faculty demographic variables remained about the same for the main Ph.D. women and top group, with the top group averaging 1%, 5%, and 3% higher rates for the percentage of women undergraduates, women master'slevel students, and women tenured/tenure-track faculty, respectively. Student and faculty demographic variables for the top group, however, varied widely from a low of 16% to a high of 39% of women at the undergraduate-level, a low of 15% and high of 53% of women at the master's-level, and a low of 7% and a high of 21% of women tenured/tenure-track faculty. Higher demographic percentages tended to generally align with higher doctorate degree productions. When schools reported lower demographic percentages within the range listed, they tended to have higher average percentages for these groups overall. For instance, Yale University's percentages for women undergraduates, master's students, and tenured/tenure-track faculty at 29%, 35%, and 11%, respectively, were among the averages reported for the top schools for these variables. In addition to the general analysis of descriptive data, table 15 highlights those schools that resulted in the 'top producing' model for both the M.S. and Ph.D. women groups. Similar to the URM groups, this analysis was conducted because the students attending an institution for a master's degree might be the same students who remain at an institution for a doctorate degree. 11 of the same schools showed up as top producers in each model, or close to 50% of the same engineering schools produced high rates of master's and 55% produced high rates of doctorate degrees for women. The way in which this finding might relate to the conceptual framework and extant literature is further discussed in the next chapter. Highlighted school = top producer in both women degree production rate models Summary of descriptive statistics of engineering schools in the regression models that produced highest advanced degree production rates. The descriptive analyses provided an overview of engineering school characteristics that comprised the study's dependent degree production rate variables. The initial analysis of which schools produced the highest advanced degree rates for underrepresented groups showed that engineering schools in the South and Southeast produced higher rates of advanced degrees for URMs and women, although patterns for URMs were much more pronounced than for women. Additional analyses showed that many of the same schools that produced high rates of advanced degrees for URMs were located in or adjacent to states with HBCUs, as well as in states that maintained high percentages of URMs in the general population. Further, nearly all of the schools in the URM and women groups granted a doctorate as the highest engineering degree awarded and enrolled higher rates of underrepresented students and enrolled higher percentages of students from their respective underrepresented groups at the undergraduate and master's degree-level. The descriptive analysis of engineering schools that remained in the regression models revealed similar engineering school characteristics across groups. A further examination of engineering schools that produced the highest rates of advanced degrees, however, showed some differences between engineering school characteristics for the top schools compared to those in the overall group. Tables 16-19 summarize these differences. Close to 75% of the engineering schools in the top producing group for doctorates for women held AAU status, which was around 30% more than the schools in the main group. Around 5% more schools in the top group for master's degree production for women also held AAU status than the main group. Both URM groups reported fewer AAU schools in the top producing group than in their main groups. The top producing group in each of the models consistently reported lower averages for annual research expenditures and graduate program enrollment. Table 19 shows that the Ph.D. women group resulted in the smallest average differences among all of the top and main group examinations. The top producing groups also consistently reported lower average USNWR ranks compared to the overall group being analyzed, except for the Ph.D. women group, where top schools reported an average of 9 ranks higher than the main group. Comparisons of graduate admission yield and average quantitative GRE scores also showed several similarities between the top schools and overall groups, with most reporting similar figures for both. A majority of the engineering schools also reported comparable percentages for demographic variables, although the top producing schools tended to report slightly higher rates. A summary of the descriptive variables provides a general overview of the engineering school characteristics that might hold predictive power in a regression model.

As discussed in the descriptive findings, a higher percentage of URM Ph.D. students might earn degrees from institutions with higher percentages of URM M.S. students, because the master's students could be the same group of students continuing on to the doctorate degree program. Another way to examine this relationship is to determine if there is a correlation between the outcome variables for the M.S. and Ph.D. URM group. Table 24 shows that the M.S. and Ph.D. URM degree production variables were significantly correlated, although they did not approach the .80 level at which variables are considered to be strongly correlated.

As discussed throughout this study, a higher percentage of women Ph.D. students might earn degrees from institutions with higher percentages of women M.S. students, because the master's students could be the same group of students continuing on to the doctorate degree program. Thus, correlations between the outcome variables for the women group were also examined to determine if the variables significantly related to one another.

Both models for advanced degree production rates for women held significant predictors for the percentage of women undergraduates enrolled and percentages of women tenured/tenure-track faculty members. The M.S. URM and women models also both held significance for the percentage of undergraduates from their respective underrepresented group enrolled in an engineering school. That is, engineering schools granted higher rates of master's degrees to underrepresented students when they enrolled higher rates of underrepresented students from their respective underrepresented group. Further, both Ph.D. models revealed that engineering schools were more likely to grant higher rates of doctorates to URMs and women when schools enrolled higher percentages of master's students from their respective underrepresented group.

A majority of these top producing schools were located in the South and Southeast and in or adjacent to states with HBCUs. Further, 22 of the schools that produced the highest rates of master's degrees and 21 of the schools that produced the highest rates of doctorates for URMs -or around 90% -were located in states where URMs comprised at least 20% of the population. The percentage of URMs in the population was as high as 62% for those schools located in Washington, D.C., and schools in California, the state with the highest overall URM population, also showed up in both models. These geographical patterns indicate that URMs might choose to attend schools closer to home and that location could be an important factor to consider when recruiting an URM to an advanced degree program in engineering. Similarly, engineering schools that produced the highest rates of advanced degrees for URMs tended to enroll higher percentages of URM students, which indicate that URMs might find the climate at these institutions more appealing for graduate study. Similar to the URM models, engineering schools that produced the highest rates of advanced degrees for women also tended to enroll higher percentages of women students. Nearly 40% of the same schools also produced high degree rates at the master's and doctorate levels.

Engineering schools produced higher rates of advanced degrees for underrepresented groups when a higher percentage of underrepresented undergraduates and master's students enrolled. Engineering schools also produced higher rates of advanced degrees for women when they reported higher rates of women tenured/tenure-track faculty members. These repeated demographic-related findings suggest that underrepresented students tend to pursue engineering graduate degrees at institutions that appear to maintain a more welcoming climate for underrepresented groups. This study's findings also highlighted the importance of a master's or doctoral program's cohort size. This study found that engineering schools produced higher rates of master's degrees for women when they enrolled smaller master's program cohorts. While this finding was only significant at the master's-level for women, the top producing engineering schools for master's for URMs and doctorates for both underrepresented groups consistently reported lower average program sizes than the lower producing schools. These findings indicate that underrepresented students might also find smaller programs more appealing for graduate study. This study also highlighted the importance of an engineering school's ability to produce a doctorate degree. While engineering school's produced higher rates of doctorates for women when they held AAU status, they produced higher rates of doctorates for URMs when they reported lower annual average research expenditures. This finding suggests that URM doctoral students are more likely to attend less research intensive engineering schools, while women doctoral students are more likely to attend the most research intensive engineering schools. These major findings connect to several aspects in the conceptual model. The next section further relates this study's findings to the education production function and institutional capital theory."}, {"section_title": "Findings Related to the Conceptual Model", "text": "This study's findings offered several results that connect an engineering school's characteristics to advanced degree rates for underrepresented groups. This section discusses how these characteristics connect to an engineering school's advanced degree production rate for URMs and women. This study generally connected an engineering school's cultural capital to its status in the AAU. This definition connected Brosnan (2010), Fogarty (1997), and Jewel's (2008) argument that cultural capital develops over time and connects to a university's purpose to produce knowledge. AAU schools tend to compete most successfully for research funding, which is often used to support doctoral education (About AAU, 2010). Since AAU schools should have a greater ability to award higher rates of doctorate degrees because of their research base, engineering schools with AAU status should, in theory, produce the highest rates of doctorate degrees for underrepresented groups. Engineering schools only maintained higher levels of participation in the AAU in the regression model that was analyzed for doctorate degree rates for women. In this model, an engineering school's AAU status significantly predicted higher rates of doctorates for women. This finding was only significant for the model that analyzed doctorate degree rates for women, even though engineering schools overall produced close to 60% of doctoral degrees in 2008 from AAU institutions (AAU Facts and Figures, 2010). In 1975, McCarthy & Wolfle (1975 reported on the efforts of AAU schools to produce doctorate degrees for underrepresented groups. These researchers reported that around 1% of AAU schools produced doctorates for women in engineering. The significant finding that AAU schools in this study were more likely to produce higher rates of doctorates for women in engineering shows that considerable ground has been made by women at AAU schools. This finding supports the notion that engineering schools with AAU status are more likely to have the opportunity to use their research funds to support higher rates for women earning doctorate degrees. The descriptive findings also suggest that engineering schools with AAU status are less likely to produce high rates of doctorates for URMs compared to those without membership. This finding indicates that the engineering schools with less ability to financially support doctoral students through research grants are the ones most likely to award higher rates of doctorates to URMs. While the regression model findings related to an institution's demographics and average research expenditures might help to explain this finding, it is also important to interpret this finding in light of the low doctorate degree rates for URMs in this study. The engineering school with the highest doctorate degree production rate for URMs examined in the regression model only awarded 9% of all doctorates to URMs. Further yet, this finding could relate back to an engineering school's ability and plan to utilize research funds to recruit and retain URMs in doctorate programs. Engineering schools in the AAU should have a greater ability to offer financial support to graduate students. While this study did not examine financial support offers from AAU schools, it is one area engineering schools should consider as a way to increase the representation of URMs in advanced programs. Since the majority of individuals with engineering doctorates earn a master's degree beforehand, this study also examined an engineering school's ability to provide financial resources for graduate study -signified as its membership in the AAU -for master's level students. The descriptive finding that few engineering schools held AAU status when master's degree rates were examined might not seem significant since an AAU institution's role is to support doctoral education. This finding, however, is noteworthy because of the doctoral-level granting status that each institution in this study maintained. That is, this study only examined schools that awarded a doctorate as the highest degree. Thus, the schools in this study had a greater chance of being a member in the AAU than would have been the case if institutions that only granted a master's degree were kept in the analysis. This finding further suggests that, with the exception of women pursuing doctorate degrees, non-AAU schools attract higher rates of underrepresented students into their advanced programs. Certain financial aspects that determine an engineering school's ability to produce an advanced degree also connected back to a school's general economic capital, which included an engineering school's average annual research expenditures and graduate program enrollment. This general definition (1) connected Brosnan (2010), Fogarty (1997), and Jewel's (2008) rationale that suggested economic capital included those resources necessary for a program to function, (2) specifically linked degree production rates to student cohort size and research expenditures, both of which Hartwig (1978) examined in his analysis of the production of engineering programs, and (3) allowed for a focus on the importance that national agencies connect to research expenditures. Descriptive findings showed that averages for all of the engineering schools in each underrepresented group plus those for the top producing groups consistently reported lower averages for annual average research expenditures and average graduate program enrollment. The regression models for the women's group also showed a significant finding for average master's student class size, while average annual research expenditures resulted in a significant value in the regression model examined for doctorate degree rates for URMs. Engineering schools tended to grant higher rates of doctorates to URMs when they reported lower average annual research expenditures. This finding was consistent for the descriptive and regression model findings. Descriptive findings also showed that engineering schools were more likely to produce higher rates of doctorates for URMs when they enrolled smaller average doctoral class sizes. Together, these findings suggest that less research intensive and smaller engineering schools grant higher rates of doctorates for URMs. Even though AAU schools -or those with higher rates of annual average research expenditures -produce the majority of engineering doctorates, the finding for URMs is similar to the engineering school productivity study by Shelton & Prabhakar's (1971), where they found that smaller engineering schools produced higher rates of baccalaureate degrees than larger ones. An engineering graduate program's cohort size could also further explain why engineering schools with lower annual average research expenditures produced higher rates of doctorates for URMs. While average class size only resulted in a significant value in the regression model that examined master's degree rates for women, the top producing institutions for all groups consistently reported lower averages for program enrollment. These findings are in line with Bowen & Rudenstine's (1992) well established book, In Pursuit of the Ph.D., where they found that programs with smaller student cohorts in economics, history, political science, English, physics, and math all completed Ph.D. programs at higher rates compared to those with larger entering student cohorts. This finding also connects to more current research from the CGS' Ph.D. Completion Project, where they found that engineering doctoral cohorts, that contained 1 to 7 students, completed doctoral degrees at greater rates than those from groups with 8 or more students (Ph.D. Completion Project, Analysis of Baseline Data, 2007). Additionally, since engineering doctoral students often complete a master's degree prior to enrolling in a doctorate program, this finding suggests that the smaller cohort connection for underrepresented groups could actually begin at the master's degree-level. The importance of student demographics at the master's degree-level was evident for both groups. Student and faculty demographic data were examined as part of the general symbolic capital variables. Other variables examined for their relationship to an engineering school's symbolic features and its advanced degree production rate for underrepresented groups included GRE scores, graduate admission yield, and a program's rank in USNWR. This general definition of symbolic capital connected an institution's prestige to Brosnan (2010), Fogarty (1997, and Jewel's (2008) argument that 'prestige' closely relates to perceptions, such as those derived from demographics, selectivity, and ranking guides. Descriptive findings showed that engineering schools in each group reported a wide range of faculty and student demographic percentages, graduate admission yields, and USNWR ranks, while average quantitative GRE scores tended to remain high and around the same rate. It is likely that average GRE scores resulted in high and the most consistent scores because schools only reported averages for students entering their programs, which would only include applicants with relatively high score on the quantitative portion of the GRE. On the other hand, engineering schools that produced the highest rates of master's degrees for women and both master's and doctorates for URMs repeatedly maintained lower average USNWR ranks compared to all of the schools in these groups. This finding could connect back to the lower percentages of AAU schools in these top producing groups, since average research expenditures factor into an engineering school's USNWR rank (Morse & Flanigan, 2009). Since none of the regression models for these groups resulted in a significant value for an engineering school's AAU status, the lower USNWR ranks further suggests that the top producing schools for master's degrees for women and advanced degrees for URMs were less research intense. The demographic variables, nearly all of which resulted in higher average percentages for the top groups, could provide additional explanations for the lower average USNWR ranks for schools that produced the highest rates of master's degrees for women and advanced degrees for URMs. All of the demographic variables resulted in significant values in at least one of the regression models, with the exception of the percentage of URM tenured/tenure-track faculty, Engineering schools with higher advanced degree production rates for underrepresented groups could have received a lower peer ranking, if they were viewed as less selective because of their diversity (Brewer et al., 2002). While an engineering school's peer score in its USNWR rank might decrease because of its diversity, engineering schools that maintained higher rates of women tenured/tenure-track faculty granted higher rates of advanced degrees for women. The very low percentage in which URMs are represented among engineering faculty -an average of 5% in this study -might explain why this variable was not significant in the regression models. The percentage of women tenured/tenure-track faculty resulted in significant values in both degree production models for women, even though women faculty only comprised an average of 12% of tenured/tenure-track faculty members in the regression models. Since faculty are one reason that students select engineering doctoral degree programs, this finding supports previous research and reports that emphasize the important role of women faculty role models in the doctoral degree production of women in STEM fields (Freehill et al., 2008;National Academies, 2007;Nettles & Millett, 2006;Ong et al., 2011;The Woodrow Wilson Foundation, 2005;Varma & Freehill, 2010). This finding is particularly noteworthy considering that women comprised such a small percentage of engineering faculty members in this study. Engineering schools also produced higher rates of master's degrees for both women and URMs when schools maintained higher rates of undergraduate students in their respective underrepresented group. Similarly, engineering schools produced higher rates of doctorates for women and URMs when higher percentages of women or URMs were enrolled in master's programs. These variables resulted in significant values, even though the average enrollment in undergraduate programs was between 11% and 12% for URMs and 19% for women, and 7% and 25% in master's programs for URMs and women, respectively. The demographic findings could relate back to the perceived prestige an institution maintains, and schools with higher rates of URMs which could be perceived as less selective maintain this negative perception, even though HBCUs grant high rates of bachelor's degrees for blacks who later earned a doctorate degree in science or engineering (Brewer et al., 2002;Burrelli & Rapoport, 2008). While it has been shown that HBCUs play a significant role in the future educational achievement for blacks in science and engineering programs, the purpose of this study was to isolate engineering degree data to determine if similar characteristics identified in the science and engineering or STEM-related literature also apply to the field of engineering. The next section compares this study's findings to the STEM-related literature."}, {"section_title": "Comparison of STEM Literature and Engineering Specific Findings", "text": "Studies that examine factors that relate to the doctoral degree production of underrepresented students in engineering programs often do so from a STEM-related approach. These studies rarely consider the master's degree in the analyses of the role of a student's educational pathway. Since researchers and reports call to examine these data by field, and because the common pathway to an engineering doctorate degree includes a master's degree, this study aimed to identify institutional characteristics that related specifically to engineering advanced degree production for underrepresented groups. Figure 6 compares some of this study's major findings with STEM-related literature. Similar to STEM-related reports that indicate the importance of HBCUs, this study's findings for the location of engineering schools with high rates of advanced degrees for URMs suggest that HBCUs might continue to play an important role in the advanced degree production rate for URMs in engineering programs. While very few HBCU schools were in this study, the general South and Southeast location of HBCUs and higher URM population in this part of the country (U.S. Census, 2009) indicates that URMs might attend an HBCU as an undergraduate before continuing on to a graduate degree at a school in the same region. Strayhorn's (2009) finding about the importance that URMs place on location when selecting a science or engineering graduate program supports the idea that URMs might not travel far from home, or possibly, their undergraduate institution, when selecting an engineering graduate school. The literature on the role of HBCUs in the development of a black student's plans for a doctorate degree often credits the role of peers and faculty (Brazziel & Brazziel 1997;Cooper, 2004;Freehill et al., 2008;Perna, Lundy-Wagner, Drezner, Gasman, Yoon, Bose, & Gary, 2009;Solorzano, 1995). The importance of peers and faculty consistently resulted in significant relationships for how their demographics related to an engineering school's advanced degree production rate for underrepresented students in this study. Previous STEM-related literature reported mixed results on the role of women faculty and degree outcomes for women in STEM programs, while most studies agreed that URM faculty influenced degree outcomes for URMs (Nettles & Millet, 2006;Ong et al., 2011;Price, 2010;Sonnert et al., 2007). Findings from this study for engineering advanced degree programs, however, revealed just the opposite. That is, higher rates of women tenured/tenure-track faculty members increased an engineering school's rates of advanced degrees for women, while the faculty finding was not significant for URMs."}, {"section_title": "Underrepresented Student Theme STEM-Related Literature This Study's Findings Educational Pathway", "text": "HBCUs produce majority of baccalaureate degrees for blacks who earn doctorates in STEM fields (Burrelli & Rapoport, 2008). Location is an important factor when URMs consider graduate school in science and engineering (Strayhorn, 2009). Location patterns for engineering schools that produced the highest rates of advanced degrees for URMs showed a frequent pattern of schools to be located in South and Southeast and in or adjacent to states with HBCUs. These schools were also located in states with a high percentage of URMs in the population. Institutional Demographics Peers influence degree rates for underrepresented students in STEM programs (Bhatia & Engineering schools consistently reported higher rates of advanced degrees for underrepresented Amati, 2010;Cole & Espinoza, 2008;Gardner, 2007;Hurtado et al., 2009;Mwenda, 2010;Nettles & Millett, 2006;Ostreko, 2010;Wilson et al., 2011). URM faculty members positively influence degree rates of URMs in STEM fields. Findings for the role of women faculty and degrees for women in STEM are mixed programs (Nettles & Millet, 2006;Ong et al., 2011;Price, 2010;Sonnert et al., 2007). groups when they reported higher rates of undergraduate and master's-level students enrolled. Significant findings revealed that engineering schools that reported higher rates of women tenured/tenure-track faculty members reported higher rates of advanced degrees for women. This finding was not significant for URMs. "}, {"section_title": "Policy Implications", "text": "Findings from this study, as well as current data on the number of women and URMs earning advanced engineering degrees, highlight the country's slow progress to address the representation of underrepresented groups in engineering graduate programs. Reports that highlight these issues call for the need to examine both national and institutional-related policies that focus on advanced degrees for underrepresented groups (National Academies, 2007;The Woodrow Wilson Foundation, 2005;Varma & Freehill, 2010). This section examines this study's findings in light of national and institutional policies associated with advanced degree production for underrepresented groups in engineering. Specific attention is focused on policies that government agencies or institutions could modify to attract underrepresented individuals into advanced engineering degree programs."}, {"section_title": "National Policy Implications", "text": "Policies and programs that address the shortages of underrepresented groups in advanced Only in the last twenty years have serious national efforts been made to address shortages of engineering advanced degrees among underrepresented groups (Clewell et al., 2006;AGEP History, 2011;ADVANCE at a Glance, 2011). This study's findings -that so few institutions produce advanced engineering degrees for underrepresented groups -could serve as a justification for a need to invest additional resources in federal programs that address this issue. Shirley Malcom, as head of the AAAS in her testimony to Congress in 2010, referenced a study that showed initial success of AGEP programs; however, the 2011 NSF budget discussed the possibility of combining AGEP with other diversity initiatives, such as ADVANCE and LSAMP (Malcom, 2010). While this move might result in cost savings for the NSF, this study's findings suggests that most institutions need additional guidance and support on how to diversify the graduate student body in engineering programs. Further, reports that draw attention to this issue indicate a need to continue and enhance federally sponsored programs (\"A Bridge for all\u2026,\" 2004; Chubin et al., 2005, Malcom, 2010Wendler et al., 2010). Additional funding is not the only way to examine policies related to advanced degree production rates for women and URMs in engineering. This study found that nearly 40% of the same schools for women and 50% of the same schools of URMs produced high degree rates at both the master's and doctoral degree levels. Further, engineering schools were likely to award higher rates of doctorates for women and URMs when they enrolled higher percentages of women or URMs at the master's degree-level; and, top producing engineering schools were located in seven of the 10 most populated URM states as a percentage of the overall population and 11 of the top 20 most populated URM states overall (U.S. Census, 2009). Strayhorn (2009) highlighted closeness to home as one of the reasons African American males chose an institution for graduate study in science or engineering. Certain geographic enrollment patterns could also emerge because of limited financial resources that inhibit an URMs ability to travel far from home, commitments to family members, and a general concentration of residency in these areas (Stassun, 2003;Stassun et al., 2010). The states that tend to produce higher rates of advanced degrees for URMs could be specifically targeted for funds to support graduate students in these engineering schools. Engineering schools outside of these states, especially those in the AAU, could also possibly attract higher rates of URMs into their graduate programs if they can offer enough financial support to offset costs associated with travelling farther from an URMs permanent residence. While this study was not able to address whether or not the same students remained at the same school for both degrees, the location pattern and finding that an engineering school's doctorate degree production rate for an underrepresented group increased when higher rates of underrepresented master's students were enrolled suggest that national reports should focus additional attention on master's-degree origins of engineering doctorate recipients. The NSF publishes a list of master's degree origins based on SED data; however, the list does not parse data by broad field, institution, and individual demographics. Individual-level demographic data for SED recipients are only available to researchers approved to examine restricted data. While researchers may apply for these data, this type of information sharing makes it more difficult for engineering schools to readily use master's degree origin data in their decision to recruit from a particular institution or to partner with a college or university on a master's-to-doctorate 'bridge' program."}, {"section_title": "Institutional Policy Implications", "text": "On the other hand, most engineering schools are able to use institutional-level data available from the ASEE to make programmatic and policy decisions to enhance diversity within graduate programs. Recent reports indicate that individual institutions need to research how their policies and practices affect the recruitment and retention of underrepresented students in STEM programs (National Academies, 2007;The Woodrow Wilson Foundation, 2005;Varma & Freehill, 2010). This study provided a list of top producing institutions from which other engineering schools can examine institutional-related features and polices that influence women and URMs to pursue and complete advanced degrees. Additionally, this study found that engineering schools reported higher rates of advanced degrees for URMs when they enrolled a higher percentage of graduate students admitted into an engineering program, maintained higher percentages of URM undergraduates, reported lower levels of annual research expenditures, and enrolled smaller master's program cohorts. Engineering schools reported higher rates of advanced degrees for women when they held AAU status, enrolled a higher percentage of women undergraduate and master's degree students, employed higher percentages of women tenured/tenure-track faculty, and maintained smaller master's program cohorts. This study showed that certain institutional characteristics should be further examined for how they relate to diversity within engineering graduate programs. This study confirmed that institutions granted more engineering graduate degrees to underrepresented students when there were more underrepresented students enrolled, as well as more advanced degrees for women when higher rates of women were employed. As demonstrated in this study, however, most doctoral-granting schools lack graduate student and faculty diversity within engineering programs. One theory that supports this finding is Schneider's (1987) idea on organizational attractiveness, where he argued that the people are the most important appeal factor in an organization. Consequently, engineering schools should examine their efforts and policies to recruit underrepresented individuals into all aspects of their programs. Bensimon (2005) offers another theory that supports how individuals within an organization can examine educational inequalities. Bensimon suggests that organizations have the responsibility to learn about inequality issues related to individuals within their organization, which she appropriately titled \"organizational learning\" (p. 100). Bensimon argues that individuals within an organization are responsible for addressing equality issues, and that it is the effect of their ideas, attitudes, and viewpoints that determine whether an organization can make significant changes to address equality issues. Engineering schools could use both the organizational attractiveness and organizational learning theories to examine how their policies and practices as a unit within a larger organization relate to the participation of underrepresented students in graduate programs. For instance, compared to top graduate degree producing institutions for URMs and women in this study, do lower producing engineering schools have an office specifically devoted to diversity and equity? If so, does the office serve all individuals within the university, is it specific to engineering, and how is it promoted to graduate students? In addition to the important role that faculty play in degree outcomes for underrepresented groups, studies that specifically address issues with diversity within engineering graduate programs highlight the role of university staff, and in particular, those within diversity offices (DeLoatch, Kerns, Morell, Purdy, Smith, & Truesdale, 2008;Simon, 2010). Specifically related to recruitment of URMs, which undergraduate institutions and which parts of the country do engineering schools recruit underrepresented students? The location patterns in this study indicate that engineering schools should focus attention on recruiting URMs from states with higher percentages of URMs in the population. From a broad institutional perspective, what policies and programs managed by the institution encourage participation of underrepresented groups? Funding for programs such as AGEP and ADVANCE tend to be at the institution rather than school or college-level (AGEP History, 2011; ADVANCE at a Glance, 2011). Thus, an engineering school also relies on programs and policies that the institution maintains to attract and address equality issues across the university. An engineering school also relies on other university programs to become a member of or maintain its membership in the AAU (AAU Membership Policy, 2010). Other broad aspects that resulted in significant values in the regression models included an institution's AAU status, master's program cohort size, and percentage of students admitted into a graduate program that later enrolled. AAU status was generally connected to an engineering school's cultural capital because it served as a signal of an engineering school's ability to produce research and provide funds to support doctoral education. AAU schools tend to receive more national grants that support doctoral education; however, certain programs likely benefit more from this support, given that the research funding evaluated for membership focuses on particular areas and specifically excludes agricultural-related research funds (AAU Membership Policy). support of programs that offer research for undergraduates, such as REUs, since these programs tend to encourage individuals to pursue advanced degrees (Eagan Jr., Garcia, Herrera, Garibay, Hurtado, & Chang, 2010;Hurtado et al., 2009;Hurtado, S\u00e1enz, Espinosa, Cabrera, & Cerna, 2007;Jones, Barlow, & Villarejo, 2010)."}, {"section_title": "Consequently", "text": "Nearly all graduate students -even those who are not part of an underrepresented groupconsider financial support in their decision to attend an institution for graduate study (Barnes & Wells, 2009;Freehill et al., 2008;Hurtado et al., 2007;Mwenda, 2010;Millett & Nettles, 2006;Nettles & Millett, 2006;Stolle-McAllister, Sto. Domingo, & Carrillo, 2011;Strayhorn, 2009). While this study was not able to analyze financial support and program selection from an individual-level basis, the finding that institutions produced higher rates of URMs with master's degrees when they maintained a higher graduate admittance yield suggests that URM and non-URM master's-level students might value similar aspects when selecting an engineering graduate program. Thus, engineering schools should also determine which policies encourage the recruitment and retention of master's students in general, as it could be that underrepresented students examine many of the same factors that students from the majority analyze when selecting an institution for graduate study. A general model for engineering graduate program recruitment and retention would provide a starting point for how to address diversity issues within engineering graduate programs; and, this study's findings provide additional aspects that engineering schools and national agencies should consider when developing policies related to advanced degree production for URMs and women. The next section provides recommendations for future research in this area."}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Future Research", "text": "Before discussing recommendations for future research, it is helpful to reflect on how the data in this study could have been examined differently, as this will help to lay ground for future research with similar data sets. Some of these considerations could be undertaken in a similar study, while others would address additional issues related to diversity within engineering programs."}, {"section_title": "Possible Modifications or Additions for Future Research with this Study's data", "text": "First, the descriptive findings revealed very few differences in average quantitative GRE scores for entrants into an engineering school's graduate programs. This is to be expected given that these averages are for students who gained admission into a program. Average GRE scores of all applicants to an engineering graduate program would have been a better way to examine this variable. While data on all applicants are not available through the USNWR rankings, this is something that could potentially be requested from the Educational Testing Service (ETS) (ETS website, About ETS Research, 2012). Correlation comparisons for the USNWR variable also showed that the items that comprise the overall rank, such as average quantitative GRE score, maintained too strong of a correlation to remain in the regression model. A future study that examines rank as a symbol of prestige might consider using only one of the variables that comprises an engineering school's rank in USNWR, such as the percentage of faculty in the National Academy of Engineering. Since the ASEE maintains institutional-level data on programs at all degree levels and specific engineering programs, a future study could examine data for bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees by program for all students and degree-granting institutions. This would allow for an analysis of master's and doctorate-degree granting institutions by their engineering degree production at all levels and by specific groups (i.e., international students, white men, Asians). The comparison of these data would reveal possible differences between degree levels, institutional type, majors, and groups that are equally or overrepresented in engineering graduate programs. These data could be examined over several time periods, which would allow for an analysis of which engineering schools report higher degree rates from an historical perspective. Further, these data could be combined with additional institutional-level IPEDS data to provide a general context of the institution in which the engineering school resides. This context could provide an additional layer from which to examine institutional demographics, size, and productivity. The finding related to an engineering school's research expenditures and doctorate degree rate for URMs could also be further explained if additional productivity data were included in an analysis. One way to interpret the finding that an engineering school produced higher rates of doctorates for URMs when they reported lower annual average research expenditures is that, perhaps, these schools are more efficient with the use of their research funding to support URMs in doctorate programs. An institutional productivity study by Wolf-Wendel and others 2000, for example, found that women's colleges, HSIs, and HBCUs produced more baccalaureate degrees for women doctorate degree holders for each dollar spent on institutional resource. A future study related to engineering doctorate degrees could examine additional efficiency resources, such as number of Graduate Research Assistantships (GRAs), to determine if engineering schools produce higher rates of doctorates for URMs based on the percentage of graduate students with GRA appointments. ASEE collects and publishes the number of GRA appointments in an engineering school each year. An engineering school's ASEE and IPEDS data could also be compared to GEM, ADVANCE, and AGEP data to see if the existence of these programs relates to higher advanced degree rates for underrepresented students in engineering. The next section begins with a discussion of how these programs relate to an institution's commitment to diversity. Future research on the educational pathway of an engineering doctorate degree recipient and the importance of further parsing data by gender, race, and major are also examined for future research areas."}, {"section_title": "Institutional Commitment to Diversity", "text": "This study's reoccurring finding that institutional demographic features predicted advanced engineering degree rates suggests that future research in this area should focus on institutional commitment to diversity. A comprehensive national study could provide a better understanding of the current resources that address diversity in advanced engineering education programs. Such a study should include an analysis of programs such as GEM, AGEP, and ADVANCE (\"A Bridge for All\u2026,\"2004;Chubin et al., 2005;Donnelly & Jacobi, 2010;Freehill, 2005;Zajicek et al., 2011). A recent evaluation of current ADVANCE programs showed mixed results for the ultimate end goal, which was to gain more women faculty in engineering. The evaluation examined two cohorts of ADVANCE awards, and the second group, which started with fewer engineering women faculty, showed the most progress (Zajicek, Rencis, Morimoto, & Hunt, 2010). A study that analyzed the effect of the AGEP program on enrollment and degrees in STEM Ph.D. programs also reported a nearly 26% increase in the percentage of URMs enrolled in these programs; however, the authors found no change in the number of doctoral degrees granted overall to URMs in engineering between 1997-98 and 2004-05 (George, Campbell, Kibler, Carson, & Malcom, 2007). While the ADVANCE and AGEP programs show some progress for women and URMs participating in engineering doctoral programs, additional qualitative studies might also help engineering schools better understand reasons that underrepresented students pursue a doctoral program. Most of the extant literature that uses qualitative methods to explore questions related to underrepresented students who pursue science and engineering doctoral programs does so from a narrow institutional or program specific approach (Mwenda, 2010;Perna et al., 2009;Stolle-McAllister, Sto. Doming, & Carrillo, 2011). These qualitative studies could possibly be used as a starting point for a much more comprehensive study, which is needed to better generalize findings across institutions, and to make mixed findings more clear. A qualitative study of the top engineering advanced degree institutions for underrepresented groups in this study could provide researchers with more in-depth information on why underrepresented groups select their programs for graduate study. A more in-depth qualitative study might also help to provide additional explanations for why only top producing engineering schools for women with doctorates held AAU status. Since AAU schools award higher rates of doctorates than non-AAU schools, a more detailed examination of these schools would provide higher education policy makers with a better framework from which to encourage AAU institutions to also produce higher rates of advanced engineering degrees for underrepresented groups."}, {"section_title": "Educational Pathway Exploration", "text": "Some of the same schools resulted in higher degree production rates for underrepresented students at both the M.S. and Ph.D.-level. This finding coupled with the fact that the majority of individuals with doctorates in engineering earn a master's degree en route suggests that mastersto-doctorate 'bridge' programs are another area that merits further exploration. M.S.-to-Ph.D. engineering 'bridge' programs are another area where researchers could use both qualitative and quantitative analyses to further examine relationships between M.S. and Ph.D. programs, as well as, possible collaborations between schools. 'Bridge' programs encourage underrepresented participation from high school-to-baccalaureate degree programs, baccalaureate-to-master's degree programs, and baccalaureate/master's degree programs-to-doctorate degree programs (Freehill, Jacquez, Ketcham, Lain, Williams, & Pena, 2006 Lange's (2006) finding that URMs are more likely to earn an M.S. degree on the way to a doctorate (Stassun et al., 2011). This study's findings, however, do not necessarily mean that URMs attend the same institution for master's and doctoral programs. In fact, Lange's research on URMs' educational pathway in STEM programs also indicated that URMs were more likely to earn each degree from a different institution. Future research that includes both individual and institutional-level data would better account for master's-degree locations of underrepresented engineering doctorate recipients. Further, since this study only included schools that granted a doctorate as the highest degree available at an institution, future studies could also compare master's degree rates for underrepresented students from institutions that grant the master's as the highest degree in engineering. The latter analysis might have the best likelihood of identifying possible 'bridge' collaborations between master'sonly engineering schools and doctorate-degree granting institutions."}, {"section_title": "Specific URM Group and Major-Level Data", "text": "The most useful analyses, whether of a focus on an institution's commitment to diversity or an underrepresented student's educational pathway, might come about if data are examined by specific engineering major and URM group. This study was not able to parse data by major or specific ethnic group because the sample was too small for such an examination. Although engineering is an interdisciplinary field, the accrediting bodies, engineering organizations, and national agencies recognize important differences between engineering majors (ABET, Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs, 2012-2013; ASEE, Divisions, 2011; NSF, Directorate for Engineering, 2011). According to the ASEE, African Americans, Native Americans, and Hispanics earned 65 doctoral degrees in chemical engineering in 2010, which was the highest total for this group among all engineering majors. This same group earned less than 10 doctoral degrees in the fields of architectural, mining, petroleum, civil/environmental, biological/agricultural, and environmental engineering. Women with U.S. citizenship or permanent residency status earned 144 doctoral degrees in chemical engineering in 2010, which was also their highest among any other engineering major. Women also earned their fewest doctoral degrees in architectural, mining, and petroleum engineering (ASEE, Engineering College Profiles and Statistics, 2010). Differences also exist between 'women' and 'URM' as a group. URMs make up the 'women' group, just as both genders comprise the 'URM' group. For instance, African Americans -as a group -earned 21 engineering doctoral degrees in chemical engineering in 2010, which was their highest degree total among all engineering fields. African American men, however, earned 15 doctoral degrees in electrical engineering, which was their highest degree total; and, African American women earned 10 doctoral degrees in biomedical engineering, which was their highest doctoral degree total out of all engineering majors (ASEE, Engineering College Profiles and Statistics, 2010). An analysis of advanced engineering degree production rates by specific ethnic group, gender, and major could also help explain this study's findings that connected higher percentages of underrepresented undergraduate or master's-level engineering students with higher advanced degree production rates for a particular group. This study determined that a relationship exist, but it is unclear whether this connection developed because underrepresented advanced degreeseeking students were drawn toward programs with higher levels of underrepresented undergraduates, or if underrepresented undergraduates were attracted to programs with higher proportions of underrepresented graduate students. A qualitative study that focuses on the findings from this study could help to better explain the relationships found between the demographic variables in this study, and account for small sample sizes that result when data are parsed by gender, ethnic group, and engineering major. This study's findings demonstrate a need to further examine advanced degree data in engineering among underrepresented groups, including an analysis aggregated by specific ethnic group, gender, and major. The pattern of some schools to produce high degree production "}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This study revealed which engineering schools produced the highest rates of advanced degrees for underrepresented students and confirmed that several engineering school characteristics relate to advanced degree production rates for these groups. The education production function provided an economic model from which to view institutional resources, while the institutional capital theory allowed for an examination of these resources by their general cultural, economic, and symbolic representation. A variety of engineering school characteristics significantly predicted advanced degree rates for URMs and women. Certain institutional characteristics clearly influence advanced degree rates for underrepresented groups in engineering; and, institutions with lower degree production rates for women and URMs should look to the top producing institutions as a starting point from which to highlight or modify institutional characteristics to attract underrepresented students into their programs. The top producing institutions in this study must also continue to recruit underrepresented students into their engineering graduate programs, as very few of the top producing schools granted close to half of their degrees to underrepresented groups. This study showed that higher education administrators, engineering schools, and policy makers must continue to develop initiatives to support the recruitment and retention of women and URMs in engineering graduate programs. The country's competitiveness in the engineering field, diverse viewpoints needed in engineering education and research to solve complex problems, and the opportunity for women and URMs to have an equal chance for advancement in the engineering field all rely on continued and increased efforts to recruit and retain underrepresented students in advanced engineering programs.
