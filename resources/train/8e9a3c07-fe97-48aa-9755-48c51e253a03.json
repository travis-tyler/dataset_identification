We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of meplazumab, a humanized anti-CD147 antibody, as add-on therapy in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.\nMethods All patients received recommended strategy from Diagnosis and Treatment for 2019 Novel Coronavirus Diseases released by National Health Commission of China. Eligible patients were add-on administered 10 mg meplazumab intravenously at days 1, 2, and 5. Patients hospitalized in the same period were observed as concurrent control. The endpoints include virological clearance rate, case severity, chest radiographic, and laboratory test. This trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of Institution at the Tangdu hospital, and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT 04275245.\nFindings 17 patients were enrolled and assigned to meplazumab group between Feb 3, 2020 and Feb 10, 2020. 11 hospitalized patients served as concurrent control. Baseline characteristics were generally balanced across two groups. Compared to control group, meplazumab treatment significantly improved the discharged (p=0.006) and case severity (p=0.021) in critical and severe patients.

The infection of SARS-CoV-2 leads to acute viral exudative pneumonia, with multiple organ damages, especially in lung, presenting bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates. 7 80% cases have mild symptoms (including nonpneumonia and mild pneumonia cases), while about 20% patients have developed severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, which attribute to death. 8 As of Mar 12th, 2020, 125,048 cases and 4,613 death have been reported globally. 9 The current standard treatment including oxygen therapy, antiviral treatment, fluid management, and antimicrobial therapy for secondary bacterial infections. 10 Although several drugs, such as remdesivir and chloroquine phosphate, have been registered in ongoing clinical trials for COVID-19, no specific antiviral drugs against this novel coronavirus are approved so far. The latest report indicates the infection of SARS-CoV-2 increases the expression levels of multiple proinflammatory cytokines, including IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, MCP1, and IL-6 in the serum, which suggests the inflammation storm may involve in the progression of COVID-19. 4 Therefore, inhibiting virus replication and limiting excessive inflammation are of equal importance in COVID-19 therapy.\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the only reported host cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to our knowledge, 11 which presents in various human tissues, including alveolar epithelial cells, endothelial cells of arteries and veins, smooth muscle cells, etc. 12 Our current published data showed a direct interaction between spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and CD147, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on epithelial cells. A humanized IgG2 monoclonal antibody against CD147, meplazumab, effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication and virus-induced cytopathic effect in Vero E6 cells, both in a dose-dependent manner. These data demonstrated a novel entry of virus infection mediated by CD147 receptor. 13 CD147 is also presented in activated inflammatory cells and participates the regulation of cytokine secretion and leukocytes chemotaxis by binding with cyclophilin A (CyPA). 14, 15 CyPA is a proinflammatory cytokine that is up-regulated in response to virus infection. 16 Our previous studies demonstrated that antibody targeting CD147 inhibited CyPA-induced T cell chemotaxis thus attenuating the local inflammation. 17 Based on these evidences, we assess the clinical outcomes using meplazumab as add-on therapy in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. We designed an open-label, concurrent controlled trial to evaluate whether meplazumab infusion improves the patients with COVID-19 pneumonia by inhibiting virus replication and suppressing inflammation.

In contrast, 4 common cases, 4 severe cases, and 3 critical cases were collected in control group, showing no difference compared to meplazumab group (p=0.688). Subsequently, 11 patients had received 3 doses meplazumab, and 6 patients had received 2 doses meplazumab.\nThe distribution of case severity and discharged cases was analyzed in each group over 28 days follow-up as shown in table 2. The overall improvement rates (defined as the percentage of discharged or improved cases) at days 7, 14, 21, 28 were 17.6% (3/17), 47.1% (8/17), 82.4% (14/17), and 94.1% (16/17) in the meplazumab group, while those were 0% (0/11), 27.3% (3/11), 54.5% (6/11), and 81.8% (9/11) in the control group, respectively. One aggravating case was observed in control group at day 7. At the end of observation (day 28), both groups showed significant improvement compared to baseline (p<0.001 for both meplazumab and control).\nRecovery in severe and critical cases is of paramount importance to reduce mortality of COVID-19. To observe the add-on therapeutic efficacy of meplazumab in severe and critical cases, we analyzed the time to discharge, and the results shown in figure 2A indicated that meplazumab treatment improved the discharged of severe and critical cases significantly compared to control group (p=0.006). No discharged cases were observed over the follow-up period in the control group.\nThe case severity of severe and critical cases in both groups were improved significantly compared to baseline, since 7 days post-treatment (figure 2B). In particular, at day 28, 4 severe cases and 1 critical case were improved to common and no case was discharged in control group. In meplazumab group, 9 cases (6 severe and 3 critical) were discharged, 2 critical cases were improved to common, and 1 critical case was improved to severe, demonstrating a significantly beneficial outcome compared to control group (p=0.021, table 2 and figure 2B). These results indicated that meplazumab treatment accelerated the improvement and make a rapid recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for the severe and critical cases. In this trial, no death was reported in all patients.\nChest radiographic analysis was performed independently by two radiologists, and graded by the changed areas of ground-glass opacity and consolidation compared with the baseline. As shown in figure 3 , the chest radiographic, compared to baseline in both two groups, were improved gradually over 28 days.

The analysis of time to virus negative indicated that meplazumab-treated patients converted to negative in a shorter period than patients in control group significantly (median 3, 95%CI[1.5-4.5] vs. 13, [6.5-19.5]; p=0.014, HR=0.37, 95%CI[0.155-0.833], figure 5 ). All these data indicate an obvious benefit of meplazumab treatment in the clearance of SARS-CoV-2.\nIt was reported that lymphocytopenia is a typical characteristics and correlated with the prognosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. In our study, we compared the lymphocyte count between baseline and post-treatment in both groups. As shown in figure 6A , in observation period (day 7 to 28), the percentages of patients with a normal lymphocyte count (>0.8\u00d710 9 /L) were increased in both groups, while the improvement in meplazumab group was more notable. Compared to baseline, the percentage in meplazumab group was improved significantly as early as day 7 (p=0.031), but no significance difference was detected in control group over the follow-up period.\nWe also measured the concentration of CRP, as a predictors of COVID-19 severity. 19 As shown in figure 6B , from day 3 to day 28, the percentages of patients with a normal CRP concentration (\u22645mg/L) were increased from 52.9% (9/17) to 82.4% (14/17), indicating significant increases compared to baseline (all p<0.05 at days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28). In control group, the significant increases were observed at day 14, and day 21 compared to baseline. The data suggests that meplazumab exhibited an effect on the control of virus-induced acute inflammation at early management.\nIn meplazumab group, the elevation of both ALT and AST (\u2265 2 ULN ) was reported in 2 patients (2/17, 11.8%). In control group, both ALT and AST elevations were reported in 1 case (9.1%), and single ALT elevation was reported in 1 case (9.1%). The increased level of ALT and AST returned to normal after 7 days in all four patients, and the treatment procedure was not affected by their fluctuation. The abnormal transaminase was not related with meplazumab treatment after comprehensive judgement by the investigators.

The adding meplazumab 20-30 mg in patients with COVID-19 who have received recommended treatment, 18 increased the virological clearance rate, promoted the recovery of chest radiographic and lymphocytopenia, decreased the inflammation index (CRP), accelerating the improvement of disease without serious adverse event.\nIn our recent published study, we have revealed that CD147 is a novel identified receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection by binding with spike protein. SARS-CoV-2 infection was efficiently inhibited by meplazumab targeting CD147 in a dose dependent manner. All these results provide insights that CD147 acts as a functional entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and serves as a therapeutic target for inhibiting virus infection. 13 It was reported 18.5% cases in COVID-19 were categorized as severe and critical cases, and fatality rate for critical case was 49.0% to 61.5%. 4, 8 These studies reveal the great challenge of enhancing the therapeutic effects for severe case of COVID-19, and focus on how to conduct effective intervention as early as possible. In this add-on trial, we introduced a novel therapy target to block the virus infection and inflammation, with a favorable efficacy. Meplazumab treatment accelerated the improvement of COVID-19, especially in the severe and critical cases. At the day 28, 69.2% severe and critical cases were discharged, and no death case was reported. The improvement of chest imaging, clearance of virus, and recovering of lymphocyte count, were observed within 1 week management, which indicated that the therapeutic effects facilitated prognosis.\nCD147 is a receptor for ligand CyPA, and its interaction with CD147 was key to the inflammation and chemotaxis. 21 CyPA is secreted to extracellular in response to inflammatory stimuli (e.g. virus infection), activates and attracts leukocytes via its receptor CD147 to the stimulus site. 15 We demonstrated that anti-CD147 antibody could attenuate the chemotactic index of T cells induced by CyPA. 17 Multiple cytokines and chemokines increased significantly in patients with COVID-19, which was significantly correlated with pulmonary inflammation index of chest CT imaging. 4.22 These results suggest that the excess immune cells migrating into lung tissue may cause uncontrolled immune response, leading to the inflammation storm, and aggravated disease. We presumed that meplazumab blocked the interaction between CyPA and CD147, attenuated the chemotactic effect of CyPA, decreased the immune cells in lung tissue, and facilitated the improvement of chest radiographic. In this trial, the remarkable and rapid resolution of inflammatory foci in lungs, like ground-glass opacity and consolidation, were observed in meplazumab treatment group.\nLymphopenia was common in patients with COVID-19 and SARS patients, and can be used as an indicator of disease severity and prognosis. 23 75.4% patients with COVID-19 reported lymphopenia. 24 Due to the absence of ACE2 in lymphocyte, it has been proposed that the lymphocytopenia in SARS patient is caused by the indirect mechanism, including inflammation storm, vascular cell adhesion, soluble Fas ligand, and glucocorticoids. 12, 25 However, the SARS-CoV particles and genomic sequence were detected in a large number of circulating lymphocytes, causing destruction of lymphocytes. 26 In this trial, lymphocyte count in meplazumab-treated patients were restored in short time.

Meplazumab interrupted this process by preventing virus invasion to keep lymphocytes survived. Second, the meplazumab blocking CD147-CyPA interaction might contribute to lymphocyte elevation in peripheral blood by inhibiting the lymphocyte accumulation in pulmonary organ.\nIn summary, we establish a \"specific antibody add-on therapy model\", a combined therapeutic strategy of the specific antibody with recommended antivirus treatment, and demonstrate it safe and effective. The effective dosage of antibody by timely administration attenuates the inflammation in patients with COVID-19, and facilitates the patients to get through acute exudation of pneumonia. Therefore, antibody therapy can extend the therapeutic window, thus safeguard patients pass the dangerous period.\nA favorable specific antibody drug should inhibit the virus replication and suppress the inflammation storm. Meplazumab, an anti-CD147 antibody, can block the receptor of host cells, and inhibit the virus invasion and replication by interrupting spike protein from recognizing CD147 receptor. Meanwhile, meplazumab blocks the CD147, the receptor of proinflammatory factor CyPA, thus suppressing the inflammation.\nAlthough we get the outcomes of meplazumab treatment for COVID-19, our results are limited by the small subject size and the absence of parallel control. Therefore, confirmation from larger scale and randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial is required to fully assess the efficacy and safety of meplazumab in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. perpetuity. preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in The copyright holder for this this version posted March 24, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.21.20040691 doi: medRxiv preprint"}, {"section_title": "Figure 3: Chest imaging analysis", "text": "The p values comparing between meplazumab and control at days 7, 14, 21, and 28 were from Ordinal regression.\nAll rights reserved.
