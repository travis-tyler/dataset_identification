To better protect our patients from the effects of undiagnosed or poorly controlled hypertension, we need to consider other options, such as ambulatory 24-hour blood pressure monitoring, automated measurement in the office, measurement in the patient's home, and devices that analyze the peripheral pulse wave to estimate the central blood pressure and other indices of arterial stiffness."}, {"section_title": "Manual office MeasureMent \u25a0 has inherent liMitations", "text": "Office blood pressure measurements do provide enormous information about cardiovascular risk and the risk of death, as shown in epidemiologic studies. A meta-analysis 1 of 61 prospective observational studies that included more than 1 million patients showed that office blood pressure levels clearly correlate with increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease and stroke.\nBut blood pressure is a dynamic measure with inherent minute-to-minute variability, and measurement will not be accurate if the correct technique is not followed. Traditional office sphygmomanometry is a snapshot and does not accurately reflect a patient's blood pressure in the real world and in real time.\nRecently, unique patterns of blood pressure have been identified that may not be detected in the physician's office. It is clear from several clinical trials that some patients' blood pressure is transiently elevated in the first few minutes during office measurements (the \"white coat effect\"). In addition, when office measure-ments are compared with out-of-office measurements, several patterns of hypertension emerge that have prognostic value. These patterns are white coat hypertension, masked hypertension, nocturnal hypertension, and failure of the blood pressure to dip during sleep."}, {"section_title": "White coat effect \u25a0", "text": "The white coat effect is described as a transient elevation in office blood pressure caused by an alerting reaction when the pressure is measured by a physician or a nurse. It may last for several minutes. The magnitude of blood pressure elevation has been noted to be higher when measured by a physician than when measured by a nurse. Multiple blood pressure measurements taken over 5 to 10 minutes help eliminate the white coat effect. In a recent study, 2 36% of patients with hypertension demonstrated the white coat effect.\nIn a study by Mancia et al, 3 46 patients underwent intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring for 2 days, during which time a physician or a nurse would check their blood pressure repeatedly over 10 minutes. This study found that most patients demonstrated the white coat effect: the blood pressure was higher in the first few measurements, but came down after 5 minutes. The white coat effect was as much as 22.6 \u00b1 1.8 mm Hg when blood pressure was measured by a physician and was lower when measured by a nurse."}, {"section_title": "White coat hypertension \u25a0", "text": "In contrast to the white coat effect, which is transient, white coat hypertension is defined as persistent elevation of office blood pressure measurements with normal blood pressure levels when measured outside the physician's office.

This condition is called masked hypertension. 8 For clinicians, the danger lies in underestimating the patient's risk of cardiovascular events and, thus, undertreating the hypertension. Preliminary data on masked hypertension show that the rates of end-organ damage and cardiovascular events are slightly higher in patients with masked hypertension than in patients with sustained hypertension."}, {"section_title": "nocturnal hypertension \u25a0", "text": "Elevated nighttime blood pressure (>125/75 mm Hg) is considered nocturnal hypertension and is generally considered a subgroup of masked hypertension. 9 In the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK), 10, 11 although most patients achieved their blood pressure goal during the trial, they were noted to have relentless progression of renal disease. On ambulatory 24-hour blood pressure monitoring during the cohort phase of the study, 10 a high prevalence of elevated nighttime blood pressure (66%) was found. Further analysis showed that the elevated nighttime blood pressure was associated with worse hypertension-related end-organ damage.

Data from our institution 15 showed that nondipping was associated with a greater decline in glomerular The lack of reproducibility of a person's dipping status has been a barrier in relying on this as a prognostic measure. White and Larocca 16 found that only about half of the patients who appeared to be nondippers on one 24-hour recording still were nondippers on a second recording 4 to 8 weeks later. Compared with nondipping, nocturnal hypertension is a more stable blood pressure pattern that is being increasingly recognized in patients undergoing 24-hour blood pressure monitoring."}, {"section_title": "autoMatic Blood pressure devices \u25a0", "text": "An automated in-office blood pressure measurement device is one way to minimize the white coat effect and obtain a more accurate blood pressure assessment.

It interferes with the patient's activities and with sleep, and this can affect the readings. It is also expensive, and Medicare and Medicaid cover it only if the patient is diagnosed with white coat hypertension, based on stringent criteria that include three elevated clinic blood pressure measurements and two normal out-of-clinic blood pressure measurements and no evidence of end-organ damage.

In contrast, central aortic blood pressure, the central augmentation index, and pulse wave velocity are measures derived from brachial blood pressure as well as arterial pulse wave tracings. They provide additional information on arterial stiffness and help stratify patients at increased cardiovascular risk. The art of evaluating the arterial pulse wave with the fingertips while examining a patient and diagnosing various ailments was well known and practiced by ancient Greek and Chinese physicians. Although this was less recognized in Western medicine, it was the pulse wave recording on a sphygmograph that was used to measure human blood presNondippers have a higher risk of cardiovascular death, microalbuminuria, and decline in glomerular filtration rate sure in the 19th century. 23 In the early 20th century, this art was lost with the invention of the mercury sphygmomanometer.\nWith age or disease such as diabetes or hypercholesterolemia, arteries gradually lose their elastic properties and become larger and stiffer. With each contraction of the left ventricle during systole, a pulse wave is generated and propagated forward into the peripheral arterial system. This wave is then reflected back to the heart from the branching points of peripheral arteries. In normal arteries, the reflected wave merges with the forward-traveling wave in diastole and augments coronary blood flow. 24 In arteries that are stiff due to aging or vascular comorbidities, the reflected wave returns faster and merges with the forward wave in systole. This results in a higher left ventricular afterload and decreased perfusion of coronary arteries, leading to left ventricular hypertrophy and increased arterial and central blood pressure (FIGURE 2) .\nArterial stiffness indices-ie, central aortic blood pressure, the central augmentation index, and pulse wave velocity-can now be measured noninvasively and have been shown to correlate very well with measurements obtained via a central arterial catheter. In the past, the only way to measure central blood pressure was directly via a central arterial catheter. New devices now measure arterial stiffness indices indirectly by applanation tonometry and pulse wave analysis (reviewed by O'Rourke et al 25 ). Several trials have shown that these arterial indices have a better prognostic value than the mean arterial pressure or the brachial pulse pressure. For example, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging 26 followed 100 normotensive individuals for 5 years and found that those with a higher pulse wave velocity had a greater chance of developing incident hypertension. Other studies showed that pulse wave velocity and other indices of arterial stiffness are associated with dysfunction of the microvasculature in the brain, with higher cardiovascular risk, and a higher risk of death.\nA major limitation in measuring these arterial stiffness indices is that they are derived values and require measurement of brachial blood Pulse-wave patterns in normal and stiff arteries M Medical Illustrator: Beth Halasz"}, {"section_title": "CCF", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "\u00a92009", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "FIGURE 2 stiff artery normal artery", "text": "The left ventricle contracts during systole, generating a pulse wave that propagates forward into the peripheral arterial system.
