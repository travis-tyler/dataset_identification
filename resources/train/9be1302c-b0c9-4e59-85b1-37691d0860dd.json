Many concepts and perceptions change with the advancing technology and science. In order to keep up with this rapid change and innovation, the knowledge and skills expected from new generations changes. This rapid change and innovations should be followed in the field of education for future generations. In order not to fall behind the era, we need to regulate our education programs for this renewed knowledge and science.\nMathematics is a system of order. In other words, mathematics is a branch of science that examines numbers, shapes and the relationship between them to put in order. It is also a language built on shapes and symbols. Information around us is interpreted, edited and predicted with mathematics (Ocak and \u00c7imenci Ate\u015f, 2015) . The ability to know and use mathematics, which is an important area in our daily lives, and the need for mathematics are increasing rapidly. In the changing and developing world, people who know mathematics and those working on it are one step ahead of the future. In line with the needs of change and development, mathematics education must gain meaning again and educators need to restructure by adapting to new or changed requirements and development. Making, understanding and interpreting mathematics change over time with the improvements in the new technologies, to illustrate the complex calculations made in the past are now very easy with the calculators and computers. Time-varying mathematical perception has become increasingly important. As such, more problem solving skills and higher level thinking skills have gained more importance. People now have easily got access to all the information they want. It is not as hard as it used to be. For this reason, the ability to use mathematical development and thinking to keep up with time and development have increased over time and have become very important for elementary students. average score of mathematics is always very low compared to other branches at the national exams such as the end of middle school exams, and university entrance examinations. Moreover, considering the averages of mathematics and science scores is important in International Examinations such as Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study [TIMSS] and Program for International Student Assessment [PISA] . The mathematics and science courses average scores of Turkey are very low after the curriculum changes in the new applied curriculum (Duru and Korkmaz, 2010 as cited in Ocak and \u00c7imenci Ate\u015f, 2015) . TIMSS which is an International Examination conducted for the fourth and seventh-grade students has been made every 4 years since 1995. In 2011, a total of 42 countries, 4 th and 8 th -grade students, participated in the TIMSS. Turkish eighth-grade level students have participated to TIMSS in 1999 TIMSS in , 2007 TIMSS in , 2011 TIMSS in and 2015 . When we analyze the results, it is seen that Turkey has left only 16 countries behind. The reason why we cannot achieve success in these important international examinations makes us think to move further (Ocak and \u00c7imenci Ate\u015f, 2015) .\nUnfortunately, the level of mathematics achievement was not at the level we wanted. The mathematics curriculum was also developed in the direction of constructivist theory by getting rid of its old rigid behaviorist structure. It was firstly implemented in the 2005-2006 academic year. As a result of the renewed curriculums, 12 years of compulsory education and some evaluations, there have been changes in some subjects over time. In addition, a middle school mathematics curriculum was introduced in 2013 (Ocak and \u00c7imenci Ate\u015f, 2015) . The renewed mathematics curriculum is based on the idea that every child can learn mathematics. The most of concepts related to mathematics are abstract by its nature than the other sciences; it is not easy to detect when children are learned the concepts according to their level of development. For this reason, basic concept knowledge about mathematics is handled based on concrete and finite life models (MoNE, 2009 ).\nIn a learning environment organized with a constructivist approach, students gain experience by utilizing general mathematical methods such as abstractions, explanations, symbolizations, generalizations, proofs and new questions through activities. These methods are directly related to the realization of the subject and to the realization of meaningful learning. In addition to these, it is also learned that certain concepts and skills will be needed for the activities and studies to be carried out for the exploration of purposes (Ocak and \u00c7imenci Ate\u015f, 2015) .\nIt is a set of systems that suggest thinking in mathematics. It enables us to understand our environment and our world. Mathematics consists of a variety of structures and relationships. This system is the whole of the outgoing systems. It proceeds in the process of abstraction and generalization. From this point on, we can understand how mathematics is actually an abstract structure. And the concept of abstract concepts and definitions is not easy at all (Baykul, 2014) Doing mathematics does not mean you can just solve many questions or pass exams by imitating a teacher in the lesson. It is more than that. Doing mathematics is developing a strategy to solve problems, implementing this strategy and reaching to a conclusion. This method is found and the result is building connection abstraction to real life. Knowing how to transfer abstract mathematical things to real life is really different for students. The more we model these problems in the real world, the more mathematics we have done in daily life (Van de Walle, Karp, Bay-Williams, Wray and Brown, 2007) . National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) (1998; 2000) emphasized that one of the most fundamental sub-areas of mathematics is geometry to build this connection If we need mathematics in our daily lives, we need geometry. We can imagine that they have completed each other and that mathematics without geometry will be incomplete. Geometry has a lot of applications in daily life. These are usually various objects and shapes we often meet in our own lives. We can give examples of buildings around us, many things we use, the houses we live in and many more. The geometry will only be too much to see, such as shape information or angles and edges. Geometry completes mathematics as well as helping to establish the relationship between other branches. This way of thinking is also associated with other disciplines and it is beneficial for students to use their reasoning abilities actively.\nGeometric thinking is very important if we set out from reasoning abilities. It enables students to stimulate their reasoning abilities and to increase their ability to comment on different disciplines. The aim of geometry and mathematics is to enable the students to overcome the problems that may be encountered in their lives. Although they appear to be composed of shapes and rules, they should be able to use them in solving their problems. Mathematics and geometry become more meaningful if we create this awareness in students. This is why mathematics and geometry are necessary for elementary grades (\u00dclger, 2003) ."}, {"section_title": "Van Hiele Geometric Thinking Theory", "text": "Geometrical thinking structures are the basics of the thinking structures and how many of these thinking structures have been developed are important for students. For years, the studies on this subject continued in a spiral manner. The most prominent of these studies is started with the \"Van Hiele model\" by Dina Van Hiele Geldof and her husband Pierre Marie Van Hiele. This study that emerged in 1957 has attracted the attention of many researchers around the world. Van Hiele theory formed the basis of several studies related to the geometry at the literature (Erdo\u011fan, 2006; Olkun and Toluk, 2003) . Van Hiele theory played a very important role in understanding geometry, interpreting and determining the development of geometric thinking levels. The theory has also been the source of even wider reviews by providing practice in the classroom. In van Hiele's theory, students must actively participate in the activities prepared to achieve the expected goals and explore the features related to geometrical definitions (Gutierrez, 1992) .\nThe most striking point in the van Hiele model is that it divides the levels of geometric thinking into five levels. Each of these levels constitutes the level of thinking. The aim of the levels is to determine the students' perspective and mental processes rather than the achievement levels at geometry. The difference between the levels is related to the perspective of geometry (van de Walle et al., 2007) . The levels found in the Van Hiele model are as follows:\nWhat is thought at the visualization level is to know the shapes and what they look like. Only the outward appearance of the figures is considered. Therefore, the elements of the shapes and features of the students were in the first place of knowing and interpreting geometric shapes.\nGeometric shapes are evaluated at this level only by their appearance. Elements and properties of geometric shapes, not the size of the shape, are evaluated according to the stance. If a student at this level is shaped and then the figure is rotated, he will recognize this shape (Duatepe Paksu, 2016) . If a square object is given to the student, the square may be called square if it is shown in advance. And every object that looks like a square will say square. A student at the visualization level will call Figure 1b a thin rectangle if it is mentioned as a rectangle. However, Figure 1c cannot be thought of as a rectangle (Duatepe Paksu, 2016) . What is the most fundamental at this level is actually the difference between shapes or figures that students can recognize. The general purpose at the visualization level is to classify the figures according to their common characteristics. Seeing similarities and differences between the sides of the given figures improves students' ability about distinguishing. The instructional activities in geometry according to Level 1 can be:\n\uf0b7 Classification and separation activities can be performed.\n\uf0b7 Students need two-dimensional or three-dimensional objects and activities that can draw, form, disassemble, and gather together and complete these pieces. These activities should be based on different features of objects. Thus, students gain an understanding of geometry.\n\uf0b7 To help them move from Level 1 to Level 2, they should be asked about challenging questions. Students should be forced to think (Van de Walle et al., 2007) .\nAt the visualization level, students perceive the features and the details of objects and shapes together. To support students to move from level 1 (visual period) to level 2 (analysis):\n\uf0b7 Make sure that the figures shown in the lesson is chosen from daily life.\n\uf0b7 Opportunities should be provided for students to draw shapes and shreds and assemble them.\n\uf0b7 Thinking environments related to figures should be created.\n\uf0b7 Our aim is not just to give the definition, but to show the shapes one to one and give examples. The activity to be done for the students at the visualization level and some suggestions can be:\n\uf0b7 Classification of shapes according to common characteristics.\n\uf0b7 Play and search objects and shapes and find them.\n\uf0b7 Matching games with geometric shapes.\n\uf0b7 Jigsaw, completion, drawing activities.\n\uf0b7 Shapes of various patterns.\n\uf0b7 Give examples from daily life to geometric shapes (\u015eahin, 2008) 1.1.2 Level II: Analysis\nAt the second level of the van Hiele model which is analysis, students begin to understand the properties of shapes and geometric objects. They know all the features of shapes. Students are busy with shape classes rather than shapes, know and interpret all properties of a shape as well as comprehend the sum of the features of the shapes in detail. Various generalizations can be found between the shapes. They define each shape separately, but they cannot see the common points of the two different shapes. Based on this, they cannot reason about the properties of shapes. To improve the geometric thinking of students at the level of analysis:\n\uf0b7 Include studies in the form of continuation of the visualization level.\n\uf0b7 To measure the length of geometric objects used, to calculate the angle of the work.\n\uf0b7 Classify geometric shapes according to their properties.\nSome studies and various activities for students at this level are as follows:\n\uf0b7 Write down the properties of the objects given.\n\uf0b7 Building shapes with the help of various materials.\n\uf0b7 Measuring the dimensions of geometric objects and shapes.\n\uf0b7 Classification activities can be done (\u015eahin, 2008) .\nAt this level, analysis of geometric shapes is more important for the student than for the appearance of the shapes. Comprehension is a valid mind competence for this level. For students, the features are more important than the appearance of the shape. At this level, students can separate the square, rectangle, and parallelogram from each other according to their characteristics, but they cannot comprehend the common features of each other and that each square is a rectangle. They cannot see whether the properties of the shapes are related to each other. For example, they know that the opposite sides are parallel to each other in a parallelogram, but they cannot establish the relationship between the parity of the sides. In other words, students do not know that it should be parallel and reasons behind the being parallel (Duatepe, 2016) .\nThe most noticeable difference between Level 1 and Level 2 is the object of thought. While students in Level 2 continue to use models and draw shapes, they begin to see them as representations of shape classes (Van de Walle et al., 2007) . To enable students to pass from Level 2 to Level 3, let them say \"Why?\" Students should be forced to think and reason with questions such as questions and questions that push the mind skill on the subject ( Van de Walle et al., 2007) ."}, {"section_title": "Level III: Abstraction", "text": "What are thought to be experienced in their abstraction level are the features of shapes. At this level, students recognize the relationships between shapes. At this level, students can classify shapes among themselves and they can see the relationship between them. For example, they call a rectangle with four right angles and they know it. The figure says that if it is a square, it has four right angles and the square is actually a rectangle. You can use expressions such as if you connect. At the abstraction level, students classify and know the shape properties. To improve the geometric thinking style and structure of students at abstraction level:\n\uf0b7 Students should be informed about what the shapes they use in class or everyday life. They may be asked to produce ideas.\n\uf0b7 Some drawing activities can be done.\nThe deduction could not be at this level. In other words, the student cannot make definitive decisions at different general knowledge about shapes. Abstraction level course is in daily life and some of the activities and recommendations can be made as follows:\n\uf0b7 Draw the drawings of shapes \uf0b7 Write and draw the properties of geometric shapes.\n\uf0b7 Prepare games to recognize and compare geometric shapes (\u015eahin, 2008) .\nAt the informal level, students should be able to say the desired and expected characteristics in the definition of a concept and feature since they realize the relationships between the figures. Instead of telling the features of a figure for a long time, students can express more clearly and simply. For example, they understand and learn that a shape can have more than one definition (Duatepe Paksu, 2016) .\nAt the level of experiential inference, students make inferences about the features of shapes and shapes and proceed within the framework of logic. They do not go step-by-step, but they can perceive it intellectually (Van de Walle et al., 2007) . Teaching techniques according to Level 3 can be applied as follows:\n\uf0b7 They should be encouraged to create and test hypotheses and assumptions. For example, \"Is this true for all triangles or is it only for isosceles triangles?\" as.\n\uf0b7 Non-formal extraction language should be used \"All, some, sometimes, not at all then\", \"What happens if\" etc. (Van de Walle et al., 2007) ."}, {"section_title": "Level IV: Deduction", "text": "At the level of deduction, students perceive much more advanced forms than their features. Only the property is not enough for the student. Beyond that, there is no questioning that almost everything is completely unacceptable. They go slowly to the proof of induction. They can make this proof in their own minds (\u015eahin, 2008) .\nAt this level, the student can follow a proof, why it is applied, and the process steps. (S)He can use the methods given. In other words, the proof is not requested to be given directly and memorized from it. The student can reveal his ability to prove himself (\u015eahin, 2008) . A student at the level of inference can work with abstract concepts and find reasonable results. A student can easily prove this level (\u015eahin, 2008) .\nIn Level 4, a student knows that the diagonals of the rectangle center each other. However, he knows that he must prove this in an inferential way. A student in Level 3 follows logical processes but does not need much (Van de Walle et al., 2007) . A student at this level on the basis of previously proven theorems (s)he can bring more to prove in any other theorem, understands the process of induction by the method of induction. In Level 4, students comprehend the concepts of proof, theorem and what they do (Duatepe Paksu, 2016) . The level of a student who comes to Level 4 is high school geometry. They try to create an inferential system with the geometry learned at the high school level. They define the theorems and build on postulates. They use logical reasoning to prove the theorems (Van de Walle et al., 2007) ."}, {"section_title": "Level V: Rigor", "text": "Systematic thinking is what is being considered to find out the relationships between different systems. They compare the axiomatic systems with each other and draw their own theorems. Non-Euclidean geometry can work. The object of systematic thinking is the axiomatic system that results in the object of thinking. At this level, students study geometry as a science. The level of systematic thinking is at the highest level of Van Hiele level. Due to this, the reason for this is axiomatic systems. Students at the level of systematic thinking are at the university level. It is even a student studying geometry (\u015eahin, 2008) .\nAt this level, the students find the axiom. The definitions are insufficient and they can obtain theorems in different axiomatic systems. They understand and interpret the geometries that are other than Euclid. They can form theorems other than Euclidean geometry. For example, Euclid's \"can be drawn toward the outside of the right only a line from a point\" instead of expressing Riemann's \"One cannot be drawn parallel from one point to the outside\" and Lobatchevski of \"a right can be drawn parallel many from a point outside.\" can understand and interpret the expression. In the Euclidean geometry, the total angle of a triangle is 180 degrees and it can be detected. The reasons why Riemann and Lobatchevski are used 180 degrees in their geometries. They perceive that the existence of more than one geometric system does not mean that only one will be true (Duatepe Paksu, 2016) .\nThe research problem of the study is \"What are seventh-grade students Van Hiele geometric thinking the levels about quadrilaterals subject?

At the visualization level gender does not differentiate students. Moreover, it was examined whether the achievement of the quadrilaterals test varies according to gender. According to the results obtained from the quadrilaterals achievement test of girl students' mean 13.63, the boys' achievement test mean was 10.69. On average, girls were more successful than boys. There was no significant mean difference between the results of t test in the quadrilaterals achievement test of boys and girls (p = 0.92> 0.05). Similar to van Hiele geometric thinking test results, this result can be linked with students van Hiele geometric thinking levels.\nSuggestions of the future studies:\n\uf0b7 Research should be carried out with a bigger sample than this study.\n\uf0b7 Instead of only using gender and schools, socioeconomic status, mothers and fathers education level should be added to study.\n\uf0b7 Students attitudes toward geometry and mathematics and self-efficacy should be controlled at the further studies."}]
