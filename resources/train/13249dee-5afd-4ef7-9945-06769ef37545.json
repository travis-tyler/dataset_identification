[{"section_title": "", "text": "Postsecondary institutions, state governments, and accrediting agencies all play critical roles in the transfer process. As part of the transfer process, receiving institutions must decide whether the credits of incoming students are equivalent to those of their own course offerings.\nStates can influence the transfer process through legislation and regulation, and accrediting agencies provide general guidelines regarding the transfer of credit. Congress requires postsecondary institutions to be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department of Education (Education) before its students can become eligible for federal financial aid.\nPage 2"}, {"section_title": "GAO-06-22 Transfer Students", "text": "In recent years, the ability of students to transfer credits has taken on added importance because of increasing numbers of transfer students and the changing nature of the types of institutions they attend. In general, Education recognizes two main types of accrediting agencies-regional and national. Regional accrediting agencies review institutions in a region of the United States that includes at least three states that are reasonably close to one another. National accrediting agencies review programs or specialized institutions, such as acupuncture schools or private business schools, on a national basis. In recent years, some nationally accredited institutions have broadened their curricula to bring their course offerings into line with those of traditional 4-year academic institutions. Yet students from these types of institutions have complained that they have been denied transfer credits on the basis of accreditation.\nAs Congress considers the reauthorization of HEA, it has requested information on the processes and requirements that postsecondary institutions have in place to assess requests to transfer academic credits. You asked us to provide information on the credit transfer process, including how and when decisions are made to accept or reject credits for transfer. Specifically in this report, we examined (1) how postsecondary education institutions decide which credits to accept for transfer, (2) how states and accrediting agencies facilitate the credit transfer process, and (3) the implications for students and the federal government of students' inability to transfer credits.\nTo answer these questions, we reviewed transfer of credit policies from a nationally representative random sample of 2-year public and 4-year public and private institutions. In addition, we conducted site visits in California, Florida, Missouri, New Jersey, and New York, where we interviewed officials from public, private nonprofit, and private for-profit postsecondary institutions that were nationally and regionally accredited. In order to get a broad perspective on the challenges that students face when transferring credit, we selected states with large transfer student populations and varying levels of involvement in the credit transfer process. We also interviewed officials from state education agencies regarding institutional transfer policies and state initiatives to facilitate credit transfer. We also interviewed officials from accrediting agencies and national experts on credit transfer. Further, we reviewed state legislation and accrediting agencies' standards concerning transfer of credits. Finally, we examined Education's databases on postsecondary institutions. We reviewed documentation about the various methodologies used to collect the data in the databases and conducted interviews to establish the reliability of the data. We conducted our work from January 2005 through\nPage 3\nSeptember 2005 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. For a more detailed explanation of our methodology, see appendix I.\nWhen deciding which credits to accept from transfer students, receiving institutions consider the sending institution's type of accreditation, whether academic transfer agreements with the sending institution exist, and the comparability of coursework, but policies vary in how they evaluate and apply a student's transferable credits. About 84 percent of institutions consider whether the sending institution is accredited, and many consider the type of accreditation-national or regional-when determining which transfer credits to accept. Many institutions' transfer policies specify that they only accept credits from a regionally accredited institution. As a result, students from nationally accredited institutions may have their credits denied on the basis of their previous institution's type of accreditation. About 69 percent of the institutions have agreements with other institutions to streamline the transfer process. In these agreements, receiving institutions, after reviewing the sending institution's coursework and faculty credentials, agree to accept credits directly from the sending institution without further evaluation. If agreements do not exist, many institutions review student coursework to determine its equivalency and applicability toward a degree. The processes institutions follow when evaluating the transferability of prior coursework and accepting credits for transfer vary. Specifically, institutions vary in how they evaluate credits, who makes the decisions to accept credits, and when credit transfer decisions are made. For example, some institutions evaluate transfer credits prior to student transfer, while others make final credit transfer decisions after student enrollment.\nState legislation, statewide initiatives, and the accreditation standards that accrediting agencies set help facilitate the transfer of academic credits from one postsecondary institution to another. Some states facilitate the transfer of credit among their public institutions through a variety of statewide legislation and initiatives that, among other things, support the establishment of statewide transfer agreements, common core curricula, and common course numbering systems, and encourage institutions and others to make transfer information available to the public. Accrediting agencies facilitate the transfer process through the standards they set. The accrediting agencies we reviewed set standards for accreditation that require institutions to review the educational quality of the sending institution, the comparability of credit to be transferred to the receiving institution, and applicability of the credit in relation to the programs being\nHowever, students also transfer from 4-year institutions to 2-year institutions, known as reverse transfer, as well as laterally between similar institutions (e.g., 2-year to 2-year or 4-year to 4-year). As shown in figure 1, traditional transfer accounts for at least one-third of first transfer activity. When students want to transfer their earned academic credits from one institution to another, they must submit a transcript showing their coursework and earned grades to the receiving institution. The receiving institution may then evaluate the transcript and assess the educational quality of the student's learning experience, compare the level and content of the learning experience with those of the learning experience offered by the receiving institution, and determine the applicability of the student's coursework to the degree or programs offered at the receiving institution. To help streamline the evaluation process, sending and receiving institutions enter into voluntary transfer agreements, which contain criteria for credits to transfer. \u2022 Public 2-year to public 2-year The most current national data on students show that in September 2003, an estimated 15.2 million students were enrolled in postsecondary institutions; 77 percent of these students were enrolled in public institutions, 17 percent in private nonprofit institutions, and 6 percent enrolled in private for-profit institutions.\n1 Additionally, about 6,900 degreeand non-degree-granting postsecondary education institutions had students that were receiving federal financial aid. Figure 2 shows the percentage of students attending public, private nonprofit, and private forprofit institutions, and figure 3 shows the type of institutions receiving these funds. \nIn order to acquire federal financial aid, students are required, among other things, to demonstrate financial need, demonstrate qualifications to enroll in postsecondary education, be working toward an eligible degree or certificate, be a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen, and maintain satisfactory academic progress while in school. Education uses a formula to determine the amount of a student's financial need and his or her expected family contribution toward tuition, taking into account a number of factors including the student's or family's resources and the costs of attending an institution. In their financial aid packages, students may receive federal grants or loans, with the neediest students receiving about $4,000 per year in a Pell grant and up to $4,000 in loans under the Perkins loan program. Additionally, all students qualify to receive Stafford loans for which the government may subsidize or defer the loan interest while students remain enrolled in school.\nPrior to granting credit for courses taken at another institution, institutions may consider a variety of criteria, such as accreditation, transfer agreements, and course equivalency. Many institutions consider the accreditation of the sending institution, including the type of accreditation-national or regional-when determining which transfer credits to accept. Institutions may also assess the equivalency of coursework taken at other institutions, either through establishing transfer agreements covering a number of courses or on a course-by-course basis. Though reviewing courses can be time-consuming and maintaining transfer agreements requires an ongoing commitment, officials said that transfer agreements do facilitate the transfer process. Institutions also vary in who makes the final decision on which credits to acceptadministrative official or departmental faculty-and when they inform a student of their decision. \nWe found that when making decisions about whether or not to accept transfer credits, institutions often used the sending institution's accreditation as the initial measure of the quality of the institution and its coursework. We found that about 84 percent of postsecondary institutions had policies to consider the accreditation of the sending institution when assessing transfer credits.\n2 About 63 percent of these institutions specified that accreditation from any regional accrediting agency was acceptable, and about 14 percent specified that they accepted national accreditation.\nWe found that about 11 percent of institutions have policies that explicitly state that they will accept both regionally and nationally accredited credits. For example, one institution's credit transfer policy states that it will accept credits from \"universities and colleges with accreditations by one of the regional accrediting associations,\u2026 community and technical colleges with accreditation by one of the regional accrediting associations,\u2026 and technical colleges, business colleges and other schools lacking regional accreditation but having accreditation by another agency recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation [CHEA] .\" 4 Officials from a regionally accredited institution told us that they would accept credits regardless of accreditation and would review all credits the same way. However, this process was more time-consuming than relying solely on accreditation. To save time, some institutions had developed databases to track previously approved courses in order to remove the need to reevaluate them.\nOfficials at a nationally accredited institution told us that their students often have difficulty transferring credits and that they are taking actions to assist their prospective transfer students. They told us that regionally accredited institutions did not always accept courses taken at the nationally accredited institution. They advised students to assume that credits would not transfer to regionally accredited institutions. Two nationally accredited institutions we visited have responded to the credit transfer difficulties by attaining, or seeking to attain, regional accreditation in order to improve their students' ability to transfer credits. One of the three nationally accredited institutions we visited-the institution with dual national-regional accreditation-reported having no problems with transferring its students to 4-year institutions. In lieu of seeking dual accreditation, another nationally accredited institution we visited is reaching out to regionally accredited institutions to develop transfer agreements to facilitate the transfer process.\nPage 11\nWhile many institutions use accreditation as a factor to assess transfer credits, about 69 percent of postsecondary institutions have entered into voluntary transfer agreements with other institutions. 5 Typically, institutions we visited establish transfer agreements with institutions that send large numbers of transfer students. For example, Columbia College in Missouri-a college with campuses in 11 states-has transfer agreements with 18 community colleges throughout the country. In these agreements, receiving institutions review a number of courses from sending institutions and agree to accept comparable credits from that institution. For example, the State University of New York system has a transfer agreement among all of its institutions specifying that all 4 year universities will accept associate degrees from community colleges within its system, thus guaranteeing a baccalaureate degree with the completion of 60 additional credits. Agreements can also cover individual courses, such as mathematics and science courses that are required prerequisites for upper-level courses.\nInstitution officials told us that although maintaining transfer agreements requires considerable commitment, these agreements are useful because they make the transfer process more transparent and allow it to operate more smoothly. The agreements require receiving institutions to review the course content of each partner institution to determine its comparability and applicability to meeting the degree program requirements. Maintaining these agreements requires regular ongoing communication between participating institutions to keep apprised of all new course offerings or any changes to current courses or degree requirements. According to officials from several of the schools we visited, the process of establishing the agreements and keeping them current requires considerable commitment because institutions frequently revise their courses and degree requirements. For example, it took one private institution in New Jersey a full year to review courses for every community college with which it had established new transfer agreements. At another institution we visited, the official responsible for credit evaluation told us that the time required for maintaining transfer agreements had led the institution to reduce the number of its transfer agreements by about 25 percent. While transfer agreements can be timeconsuming, they help make the transfer process more transparent. agreements with community colleges in the state. Community college students may also access a Web page listing courses at their institution that will transfer to participating 4-year institutions in New Jersey, allowing students to know which credits will transfer before they apply to a new institution. One official told us that the transfer agreements, once established, allow the credit transfer process to operate smoothly between the partnering institutions, because it becomes a matter of checking a list to determine which credits to accept or deny.\nOfficials offered a variety of reasons for pursuing transfer agreements. In some instances, transfer agreements were mandated in state law or facilitated by state agencies, but these types of agreements were usually between public institutions only. In other instances, institutions sought to establish transfer agreements out of convenience because of the significant number of students that moved between their institutions. In addition to states and institutions, another organization we visited is also involved in facilitating the establishment of transfer agreements. To improve access to baccalaureate programs for certain populations of minority students, the National Articulation and Transfer Network has facilitated transfer agreements between community colleges and minorityserving institutions across the country.\nAt the institutions we visited, two groups of reviewing officials are generally responsible for determining which courses to accept for transfer: (1) an admissions or other administrative officer, who determines which courses meet general requirements, and (2) academic department faculty members, who determine which courses meet degree requirements within their departments. When reviewing officials consider the student's official transcript, they may review transfer agreements and historical lists of accepted courses, request the syllabus or a list of books used in the course, or discuss the course with a representative from the sending institution or use an Internet service, such as the one maintained by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, to obtain a syllabus and description of the course, among other things. This process is shown in figure 4 . Some 4-year institutions, citing time constraints and a significant backlog, have taken steps to limit the number of courses they review. Some institutions have established criteria for transferable courses, such as determining the minimum grade or course level for which credits will be accepted. Several 4-year institutions told us that they did not accept for transfer any remedial (developmental) courses, technical courses, or upper-level courses taken at a 2-year institution. Because of the backlog created by the number of transcripts to review, not all institutions succeed in providing students with an official report of transfer credits accepted before classes begin. Officials at one institution told us that they provide the report within 1 year of the student's matriculation and encourage students to take upper-level general education courses in the interim until the report is received.\nTo facilitate the transfer of academic credits, states enact a variety of legislation and implement statewide initiatives covering primarily public postsecondary institutions, and accrediting agencies set accreditation standards. Many states have passed legislation that requires public community colleges and 4-year public institutions to establish transfer agreements and authorizes common curricula to ease the transfer of credits. Some states have established a common course numbering system for public institutions within the state and created statewide committees to oversee the transfer of credit process within the state. In other states, state law requires university systems to initiate and form transfer agreements with institutions within the system to enhance the transferability of credits. Some states have also launched statewide initiatives to encourage transfer between 2-year and 4-year public institutions, including offering guarantees that credit will transfer. For their part, accrediting agencies facilitate the transfer process through the standards they set for affiliated institutions. Accrediting agencies that we reviewed have set standards for accreditation that require institutions to make their credit transfer policy publicly available. The six regional accrediting agencies that we reviewed generally encourage their member institutions not to accept or deny transfer credit exclusively on the basis of the accreditation of the sending institution. Some accrediting agencies have incorporated this criterion into their standards; others have issued policy or position statements.\nStates facilitate the transfer of credits among public institutions through various statewide legislation and initiatives that, among other things, support the establishment of statewide transfer agreements, common core curricula, and common course numbering systems, and encourage institutions and others to make transfer information available to the public. We identified 39 states that had legislation pertaining to the transfer of credit between postsecondary public institutions. In general, most of the legislation focuses on facilitating the transfer of credit for students transferring from community colleges to 4-year public institutions.\nSome states require or encourage the establishment of statewide transfer agreements. For example, a Massachusetts statute empowers its board of higher education to develop and implement a statewide transfer agreement to facilitate the transfer of students without the loss of academic credit or standing from one public institution to another. Arizona law requires institutions to cooperate in operating a statewide transfer network to facilitate the transfer of community college students to Arizona public universities without a loss of credit toward a baccalaureate degree. An Indiana statute requires the state's Commission for Higher Education to develop statewide transfer of credit agreements for courses that are most frequently taken by undergraduates. Colorado's statewide transfer policy guarantees that as many as 37 credits of approved general education courses taken at a Colorado public college or university will transfer among all 2-year and 4-year institutions in the state.\nSome states require or encourage the establishment of common core curricula. A California statute directed the governing boards of the University of California, the California State University, and the California community colleges to jointly develop and adopt a common core curriculum in general education for the purpose of transfer. These efforts led to California's general education transfer curriculum, which identifies courses that community college students may complete to satisfy general education requirements at campuses of both the University of California and California State University systems. An Arkansas statute requires the Arkansas Higher Education Coordinating Board to consult with colleges and universities to establish a minimum core of courses that applies toward the general education core curriculum requirements and is fully transferable between state institutions. Some states require or encourage the establishment of a common course numbering system. Florida has developed a statewide course numbering system that provides a database of equivalent postsecondary courses at public vocational technical centers, community colleges, universities, and participating nonpublic institutions. More than 100 institutions in Texas participate in the state's voluntary course numbering program, which provides a shared, uniform set of course designations for students and their advisers to use in determining both course equivalency and degree applicability of transfer credits on a statewide basis.\nSome state statutes identify the types of courses or blocks of courses that are transferable. For example, Missouri officials told us that they interpret their state law as requiring all institutions to accept associate degrees from any source as evidence that general education courses have been completed. Additionally, to facilitate student transfer among Missouri institutions and to increase institutions' accountability for student performance in general education, the Coordinating Board for Higher Education designed a 42-semester-hour block of general education. Similarly, a Texas statute states that if a student successfully completes a field-of-study curriculum developed by the state's board of higher education, that block of courses may be transferred and must be substituted for the receiving institution's lower division requirements for the comparable degree program, and the student must receive full academic credit. Likewise a Kentucky statute mandates that all lower division academic courses offered by community colleges be transferable for academic credit to any and all 4-year public colleges and universities in the state.\nSome state higher education agencies make information on transfer agreements and course equivalency guides available to the public. For example, some states, such as California, Maryland, and Florida, have placed course equivalencies online for easy access and reference. California maintains an online student transfer system called ASSIST that serves as the official repository of transfer agreements for all public postsecondary institutions in California and facilitates transfer from a California community college to a University of California or California State University campus. Maryland's interactive online transfer information source called ARTSYS allows students to find course equivalencies between institutions, evaluate their transcripts, search for majors, and explore recommended transfer programs. In addition, it provides faculty access to update courses and provide course evaluations. The Florida Academic Counseling and Tracking for Students (FACTS) system offers a comprehensive range of transfer services, including a transfer student bill of rights, links to statewide transfer agreements, and\nPage 18 GAO-06-22 Transfer Students an interactive transfer evaluation tool.\n8 A Pennsylvania statute supports the implementation of a Web-based application that makes all transfer agreements among higher education institutions available on the Internet. Similarly, Virginia requires its state council of higher education to publicize all general education courses offered at public 2-year institutions, designating the courses accepted for transfer credit at 4-year public and private postsecondary institutions in Virginia. Ohio implemented a framework that guarantees students a statewide transfer and published a transfer assurance guide to advise students of the 38 different baccalaureate degree pathways available for them to pursue anywhere within the public higher education system and in Ohio's participating private institutions, and to identify which courses are guaranteed to transfer and apply to requirements within the system. While state legislation regarding credit transfer is generally intended to facilitate the transfer of credits among public institutions, a few state statutes require or encourage the involvement of private institutions. For example, the Louisiana Board of Supervisors of Community and Technical Colleges is required to continue development of articulation agreements between institutions under the management of the board and institutions managed by other postsecondary management boards, both public and private. A Minnesota statute requests the governing boards of private institutions that grant associate and baccalaureate degrees and have a high frequency of transfer students to participate in the development of required course equivalency guides. A West Virginia statute requires the state's Council for Community and Technical College Education to establish and implement policies and procedures that ensure that students may transfer and apply the credits earned at any regionally accredited instate or out-of-state higher education institution.\nAccrediting agencies' standards for evaluating transfer credit generally reflect the three criteria specified in a 1978 joint national statement on the transfer and award of credit: the educational quality of the sending institution, the comparability of credit to be transferred to the receiving institution, and applicability of the credit in relation to the programs being offered at the receiving institution.\n9 These agencies' accrediting standards generally require receiving institutions to consider if courses are equivalent with their own curricula and standards. In 2000, CHEA issued an updated statement that offered four additional criteria that accrediting agencies and institutions should consider when making decisions about transfer of credit and academic quality. Specifically, these criteria emphasized the need for institutions and accrediting agencies to (1) ensure that transfer decisions are not solely based on the source of accreditation of a sending program or institution, (2) reaffirm that the considerations that inform transfer decisions are applied consistently in the context of changing student attendance patterns and emerging new providers of higher education, (3) ensure that students and the public are fully and accurately informed about their respective transfer policies and practices, and (4) be flexible and open in considering alternative approaches to managing transfer when these approaches will benefit students.\nThe accrediting standards and transfer policies of the 6 regional and 10 national accrediting agencies that we reviewed generally reflect the original criteria included in the 1978 joint statement. 10 In addition, some accrediting agencies incorporated into their standards the CHEA criteria added in 2000 that the institutions' process for accepting transfer credit be fair, consistently applied, and publicly communicated. 9 The joint statement was developed by the three national associations whose member institutions are directly involved in the transfer and award of academic credit: the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, the American Council on Education, and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. 10 We reviewed accrediting standards of the 6 regional accrediting agencies that accredit senior institutions (i.e., those that grant bachelor's degrees) and the 10 national accrediting agencies that accredit degree-granting institutions, rather than programs.\nThe 6 regional accrediting agencies that we reviewed all support CHEA's statement on the role of accreditation in the credit transfer decisionmaking process. As shown in table 1, some accrediting agencies have incorporated this criterion into their standards; others have issued policy or position statements. Standards \"The acceptance or denial of transfer credit will not be determined exclusively on the basis of the accreditation of the sending institution or the mode of delivery, but rather will consider if the course is equivalent, including expected learning outcomes with those of the receiving institution's curricula and standards. Such criteria will be fair, consistently applied, and publicly communicated.\""}, {"section_title": "Results in Brief", "text": "Page 4 GAO-06-22 Transfer Students offered at the receiving institution. In addition, the six regional accrediting agencies that we reviewed generally encourage member institutions not to use the sending institution's type of accreditation as the sole factor in determining which credits to accept for transfer.\nA student's inability to transfer credit may result in longer enrollment, more tuition payments, and additional federal financial aid, but the full extent to which these occur cannot be determined because institutions told us that they do not collect specific data on students unable to transfer credit. If the receiving institution decides that few or no credits earned at the sending institution are equivalent to its course offerings, the student may need to repeat coursework that could result in enrolling for one or more additional terms. National data indicate that graduates who transferred from a community college take on average 10 more credits and 3 more months than nontransfer graduates. Transfer graduates may take more credits for reasons, such as changing majors, which are not related to their decision to transfer. We could not determine the extent to which transfer students differ from nontransfer students in these areas. However, a student taking additional credits as a result of being unable to transfer credits will likely have to pay additional tuition, ranging from $150 per credit hour at public institutions to $520 per credit hour at private institutions. The extent to which these costs are borne by the student or the federal government varies depending on the student's eligibility for financial aid.\nIn this report, we suggest that Congress consider amending the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require postsecondary institutions eligible for federal financial aid to issue a statement in their transfer of credit policy that they will not deny the transfer of credit on the basis of a sending institution's type of accreditation.\nPatterns of enrollment in postsecondary education reflect that students frequently enroll in more than one postsecondary institution. Education's National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) found that 40 percent of students who entered college in the 1995-1996 academic year attended at least two institutions in the following six years. Many students enroll in community colleges with a plan for eventually transferring to a 4-year baccalaureate program. As a result, 4-year institutions face pressure to award transfer credit for coursework taken at another institution.\nData show that students transfer in numerous directions. Traditional transfer is typically from a 2-year institution to a 4-year institution."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Page 5"}, {"section_title": "Institutions Consider", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "Institutions indicating that they accepted regional accreditation told us that they also provide students with other options for getting their credits transferred, such as passing a competency examination before their credits would be granted. Many also said that they would allow any student to appeal a decision, and an appeal would result in a more thorough review of the student's transcript.\nSeveral officials from postsecondary institutions with regional accreditation told us that as a rule, they did not accept credits earned at institutions with national accreditation. For example, an official at one institution told us that the institution did not accept credits from nationally accredited institutions because the coursework was technical and not academic. Similarly, an official at a regionally accredited institution told us that the institution could not accept credits from nationally accredited institutions unless the accrediting standards of the sending institution paralleled their own standards. One reason given by regional accrediting agency official for the incomparability of credits earned at nationally accredited institutions was that these institutions follow less stringent standards regarding such factors as faculty qualifications and library resources. However, our review of the standards from the regional accrediting agencies found that no regional accrediting agency explicitly stated in its written policy that credits from nationally accredited institutions should be denied."}, {"section_title": "Page 10", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "6", "text": "Some institutions review students' transcripts to determine the comparability of the students' coursework.

To expedite this review, some institutions maintain a historical list of transfer courses that they have accepted in the past.

Accrediting agencies will not know whether an institution is following the standards and general guidelines until the institution is reviewed. Officials at one accrediting agency told us that because of the nature of the review cycle, it could take several years to review all of the institutions and thereby ensure that they had implemented the standards.\nThe inability to transfer credits may result in longer enrollment, more tuition payments, and additional federal financial aid awards, but the full extent to which such results occur cannot be determined because institutions told us they do not collect specific data on students that are unable to transfer credit. For example, a 1996 study of Arizona's public university transfer practices found that community college transfer students may be required to take additional courses in order to complete their degrees because academic departments do not always accept community college courses as prerequisites. 11 The study found that the accumulation of excess college credit hours could lead to additional years in school, added taxpayer expense such as financial aid awards, or a failure to complete a degree. Officials at selected nationally accredited institutions also told us that denials based on accreditation can result in students taking additional coursework in order to graduate. For example, one nationally accredited institution told us that one of its recent graduates had been required to repeat 2 years of coursework at a regionally accredited institution before he could be admitted to a graduate program. While credit transfer denials likely affect transfer students in a number of ways, the effect that these denials have on students' enrollment duration, success in completing a baccalaureate program, or the affordability of postsecondary education cannot be determined with available data. Institution officials told us that they did not maintain data on the number of credits they have denied for transfer because it would be too cumbersome to maintain these files.\nOur analysis of Education's postsecondary education data found that transfer students fare differently from nontransfer students. data indicate that, on average, transfer graduates take about 10 more credits 12 and 3 more months 13 to complete their baccalaureate degree than nontransfer graduates. However, transfer students could take longer to graduate for a variety of reasons that may or may not be related to their decision to transfer. For example, a student who changes majors may need to take additional courses in order to graduate. We could not determine the extent to which transfer students differ from nontransfer students in these areas. Nonetheless, students taking additional credits as a result of being unable to transfer credits will likely have to pay additional tuition. Based on national averages, these tuition payments could range from about $150 per credit hour for students attending public institutions to about $520 for those attending private schools. The extent to which these costs are borne by the student or the federal government would vary depending on the student's eligibility for financial aid.\nPostsecondary institutions differ in how they assess transfer credits, and as a result, the current credit transfer process does not ensure the consistent consideration of student coursework. To facilitate the credit transfer process, many states have enacted legislation and implemented statewide initiatives covering primarily public postsecondary institutions within their respective states. However, state efforts have limited influence over students transferring to and from the nation's private institutions or institutions located outside state boundaries. Also, all regional accrediting agencies subscribe to the principle that credits should not be accepted or denied on the basis of the type of accreditation, but not all of them have set standards requiring their member institutions to do so. When such standards have been set, it takes accrediting agencies years to review their member institutions' policies to confirm their compliance.\nTo preserve their institutional reputations and maintain quality, postsecondary institutions want their graduates to meet certain academic standards. The federal government sets the same standards for regional and national accrediting agencies to ensure that postsecondary institutions provide a quality education. At the same time, it is in the federal government's interest to ensure that students receiving assistance 12 National Education Longitudinal Study, 1988-1994, U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics. through federal aid programs, who have earned credits at an approved accredited institution, do not have to repeat coursework when transferring to another institution meeting the same standards. However, some institutions continue to deny credits from institutions with national accreditation without reviewing student coursework despite the fact that these institutions are accredited by federally recognized national accrediting bodies. Consequently, qualified students could be denied credit for comparable coursework, leading them to incur further educational costs that they may need to offset with additional federal financial aid.\nIn order to ensure consistent consideration of students' previous coursework, Congress should consider further amending the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require postsecondary institutions eligible for Title IV funding to not deny transfer credits on the basis of the type of accreditation.\nWe provided a draft of this report to the Department of Education for review and comment. In its written response, included as appendix III, Education said our report was useful and informative.\nAs arranged with your offices, unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from the issue date. At that time, we will send copies of this report to the Secretary of Education, interested congressional committees, and other interested parties. We will also make copies of this report available to others on request. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on GAO's Web site at http://www.gao.gov. To describe how the transfer of credit operates among postsecondary institutions, we examined transfer of credit policies for a nationally representative sample of institutions and interviewed officials responsible for credit transfer evaluations from public, private, nonprofit, and private for-profit institutions. At each institution, we interviewed officials and asked them questions related to their policies and practices on transfer of credit, such as their criteria for accepting transfer credits, their process for evaluating transcripts, and if students had appeal rights once a decision was made. We also interviewed officials from the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA), the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO), and the Institute for Higher Education Policy (IHEP). We reviewed publications and studies conducted by these organizations, the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC), and the Career College Association (CCA).\nTo learn about how states and accrediting agencies facilitate the transfer of credit process, we searched legal databases for state statutes in all 50 states to determine if the states had legislation related to transfer of credit. We also interviewed officials responsible for higher education from five states, officials from national and regional accrediting agencies, and the Department of Education (Education). We reviewed standards for accreditation from 10 national accrediting agencies that accredit institutions that grant degrees and the 6 regional accrediting agencies that accredit senior or 4-year institutions. The 5 states we visited were California, Florida, Missouri, New Jersey, and New York. In order to get a broad perspective on the challenges that students face when transferring credit, we selected states based on their varying levels of involvement in the credit transfer process and with large transfer student populations.\nTo understand the implications for students and the federal government of students' inability to transfer credit, we reviewed some of Education's national databases to describe the typical transfer student. We reviewed the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) database to analyze the average cost of attendance at various types of institutions and the Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS) database to learn about the transfer trends. We also used data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS). In addition, we spoke with national experts and reviewed national studies related to the implications for students and the federal government of student's inability to transfer credits."}, {"section_title": "Appendix I: Scope and Methodology", "text": "In order to collect information about the ways in which institutions of higher education treated transfer credits, we undertook a data collection effort from a random sample of 270 institutions of higher education. The sample was obtained from the IPEDS database. The IPEDS data were from the 2000-2001 time period. IPEDS is the Department of Education's core postsecondary education data collection program. It is a single, comprehensive system that encompasses all identified institutions with the primary purpose of providing postsecondary education. IPEDS is designed to produce national-, state-, and institution-level data for most postsecondary institutions.\nWe conducted a stratified random sample from the IPEDS database. The sample represented 270 institutions, with 90 institutions from each of three categories of postsecondary institutions. The three categories we sampled included 4-year public, 4-year private nonprofit, and 2-year public institutions. These three types of institutions represent 3,096 institutions and over 95 percent of students attending higher education institutions. GAO did not sample 4-year private, for-profit institutions and 2-year private institutions. These types of institutions represented 1,264 institutions but less than 5 percent of students attending higher education institutions.\nOf the 270 institutions that were randomly selected, 6 were found to be out of scope because our research indicated that they did not grant degrees or granted only graduate degrees. These 6 institutions were not included in the eventual results. Table 2 describes our source and response rates for our sample of institutions. Survey results based on probability samples are subject to sampling error. Our sample of 264 institutions is only one of a large number of samples we Sampling Strategy might have drawn from the total population of postsecondary institutions.\nSince each sample could have provided different estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our three results as 95 percent confidence intervals. These are intervals that would contain the actual population values for 95 percent of the samples we could have drawn. As a result, we are 95 percent confident that each of the confidence intervals in this report will include the true values of the study population. All percentage estimates from this survey of 4-year public institutions, 4-year private nonprofit institutions, and 2-year public institutions have sampling errors not exceeding plus or minus 7 percentage points.\nWe collected data from the 264 schools primarily through a data collection instrument that we filled out after examining the Web sites of the sampled schools. Before deploying the Web site data collection instrument, we conducted pretests with Web sites from 5 randomly sampled schools. We followed up these Web site examinations with telephone calls to ensure that the information we were obtaining from the Web sites accurately reflected the transfer credit policies of the respective schools.\nThe extent of an institution's policies on transferring credit from sending institutions varied widely, and the policies were found under different categories on the institutions' Web sites. For example, some institutions listed their policies under links to transfer student information or admissions information, while others listed their policies only in the college catalog/bulletin that was available at the Web site. Most college catalogs/bulletins listed the transfer credit policy. In almost all cases, we printed proof of answers and highlighted, underlined, or numbered the answers to match the question number. All results obtained from the Web site data collection instrument were verified by a second GAO reviewer who independently examined documentation from the Web site or the information on the Web site itself.\nAll but 8 of the 264 institutions had Web sites that we were able to examine. For those institutions that did not have Web sites, we spoke with officials from the institutions and asked questions from a telephone data collection instrument. The results of these telephone interviews were recorded by GAO interviewers.\nFor this report we used data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System database, the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988, and the Beginning Postsecondary Students longitudinal study"}, {"section_title": "Data Collection Methods", "text": "Data Reliability Assessments"}]
