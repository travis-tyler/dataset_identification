[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The early diagnostic value of glucose hypometabolism and atrophy as potential neuroimaging biomarkers of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been extensively explored using [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The vast majority of previous imaging studies neglected the effects of single factors, such as age, symptom severity or time to conversion in MCI thus limiting generalisability of results across studies. Here, we investigated the impact of these factors on metabolic and structural differences. FDG-PET and MRI data from AD patients (n = 80), MCI converters (n = 65) and MCI non-converters (n = 64) were compared to data of healthy subjects (n = 79). All patient groups were split into subgroups by age, time to conversion (for MCI), or symptom severity and compared to the control group. AD patients showed a strongly age-dependent pattern, with younger patients showing significantly more extensive reductions in gray matter volume and glucose utilisation. In the MCI converter group, the amount of glucose utilisation reduction was linked to the time to conversion but not to atrophy. Our findings indicate that FDG-PET might be more closely linked to future cognitive decline whilst MRI being more closely related to the current cognitive state reflects potentially irreversible damage."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Neuroimaging research in the field of dementia focuses on the impact of behavioral, neuropsychological, genetic and demographic factors on brain atrophy associated with transition from healthy aging through mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and further to Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Buckner, 2004; Ewers et al., 2011; Fonteijn et al., 2012; F\u00f6rster et al., 2012; Gao et al., 1998; Gomar et al., 2011; Good et al., 2001; Jedynak et al., 2012; Johnson et al., 2009; Tisserand et al., 2004) . We face a steadily increasing number of structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI, (Davatzikos et al., 2008b; Kloppel et al., 2008) ) and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET, (Habeck et al., 2008; Haense et al., 2009; Sadeghi et al., 2008) ) studies showing high sensitivity to the disease process when used separately (Alexander et al., 2002; Anchisi et al., 2005; Jack et al., 2010; Jagust et al., 2007; Kinkingnehun et al., 2008; Kloppel et al., 2008; Schroeter et al., 2009 ) and a gain in diagnostic accuracy when used together in a multimodal approach (Dukart et al., 2011a; Fan et al., 2008) .\nA viable way of understanding pathophysiology and further improving diagnostic accuracy in MCI and AD is the integration of previous knowledge about characteristic features of progression from a healthy state to AD. However, the straightforward interpretation of such an integrative approach could be limited by either systematic differences in demographic and cognitive abilities within patients and healthy controls or the use of particular image data processing algorithms (Crivello et al., 2002; Dukart et al., 2010; Jones et al., 2005) . One such demographic factor that has been shown to have a strong differential impact on disease progression is age. Previous studies have indicated that early-onset (age b 65 years) and late-onset (age \u2265 65 years) AD patients show a differential pathology in MRI and FDG-PET (Canu et al., 2012; Frisoni et al., 2007; Ishii et al., 2005; Kaiser et al., 2012; Karas et al., 2007; M\u00f6ller et al., 2013; Sakamoto et al., 2002) . Nonetheless, the interpretation of these differences is still controversial as the differences might be explained by a differential age specific baseline resulting from comparison of early-and late-onset AD patients to different agematched control group or to each other, by differential underlying pathology or by an interaction of age and disease related brain network changes. Also the link between FDG-PET and MRI and the current (as indicated by symptom severity) and future cognitive state (as indicated by future cognitive decline) is a matter of debate. Both imaging modalities have been reported to correlate with both current symptom severity and the future cognitive decline (Ch\u00e9telat et al., 2005; Drzezga et al., 2003; Edison et al., 2007; Fox et al., 1999; Vemuri et al., 2009a, b) . These findings on the other side are not fully compatible with the currently widely accepted model of progression of both imaging markers in AD suggesting a differential time-line of progression with FDG-PET showing first a rapid decline and atrophy developing rather later in the progression from healthy aging to MCI and further to AD (Jack et al., 2010 ). An accurate estimation of the unique impact of these specific factors and their interaction on the progression of MCI or AD is crucial to integrate findings across different studies. Longitudinal studies offer a potential solution; although they are logistically difficult to carry out and lack complete control for all possible confounds within a cohort (Davatzikos et al., 2008a; Drzezga et al., 2003; Johnson et al., 2009) .\nThe aim of this study is to disentangle the effect of age, symptom severity as measured by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE, (Folstein et al., 1975) ) and time to conversion (TTC) on changes in two prominent imaging biomarkers of AD-glucose metabolism and brain atrophy pattern. Therefore, we systematically investigate the effect of the factors age, symptom severity and TTC (in MCI patients) on brain pathology observed in both imaging modalities using the same group of control subjects whilst accounting for the effect of healthy aging using a recently proposed approach (Dukart et al., 2011b) . The use of the same group of patients for investigation of the effects of different variables of interest is expected to reduce potential confounding effects in other uncontrolled factors. By additionally accounting for the variance explained by healthy aging we target the question on how much AD related pathology is required at different ages to induce the same level of cognitive impairment.\nGiven the fact that age interacts with AD-specific atrophy patterns (Franke et al., 2010; Good et al., 2001) , we expected that younger MCI converters (cMCI) and younger AD patients would show a more extensive pattern of atrophy and glucose hypometabolism than older patients with similar symptom severity. According to a recent model of MCI progression characterised by rapid reduction in glucose metabolism followed by brain atrophy in much later stages of disease progression (Jack et al., 2010) , we hypothesized that cMCI would initially show a more extensive decrease in glucose utilisation compared to the amount of atrophy associated with closeness to conversion. Keeping in mind that both FDG-PET and sMRI correlate with cognitive decline (Fox et al., 1999; Herholz et al., 2011) , we hypothesized that by accounting for partial volume effects (PVE) in FDG-PET, changes in symptom severity would be more strongly linked to gray matter (GM) volume reductions than to glucose hypometabolism during progression from MCI to AD."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "To evaluate the effect of age, symptom severity and TTC on differences in FDG-PET and sMRI, we used multicenter sMRI and FDG-PET data of AD patients (n = 80), cMCI (n = 65), MCI non-converters (ncMCI, n = 64) and healthy control subjects (n = 79) ( Table 1) .

Similarly, group definition for all other groups comprised all available follow-up information, e.g. only subjects without reported conversion to MCI or AD in the available follow-up were included in the control group. Exclusion criteria for the ADNI data were the presence of any significant neurological disease other than AD, history of head trauma followed by persistent neurological deficits or structural brain abnormalities, psychotic features, agitation or behavioral problems within the previous three months or history of alcohol or substance abuse.

As for sMRI a smoothing kernel of 12 mm full width at half maximum was applied to all FDG-PET data. The obtained FDG-PET and grey matter volume images had a very similar effective smoothness as indicated by subsequent SPM smoothness estimation during statistical analyses. FDG-PET data were intensity normalized to the cerebellar mean glucose uptake and masked using a grey matter mask to avoid big edge effects. The cerebellar region was chosen for intensity normalisation of FDG-PET as it has been shown to be a region of choice for intensity normalisation which is unaffected in healthy ageing and early stages of AD when correcting for PVE caused by atrophy (Dukart et al., 2010; Kushner et al., 1987) ."}, {"section_title": "Correction for age effects", "text": "To remove the effect of healthy aging on glucose utilisation and regional grey matter volumes we first computed voxel-wise linear regressions only in control subjects and separately for both imaging modalities.

To investigate the effect of age on differences observed in FDG-PET and MRI in MCI and AD, the entire groups of AD, cMCI or ncMCI subjects were split based on age, symptom severity (MMSE score) or TTC (only for MCI converters) into 3 equally sized subgroups (Tables 2, 3, 4) matching for the remaining one (or two for cMCI) variables. For example for the subdivision of the AD group by age the 80 AD subjects were sorted in an ascending order by age and then divided into three equally sized biggest possible subgroups (for AD 26 subjects per group: 26 * 3 = 78) and leaving the remaining subjects for potential matching. Analyses of variance and if significant subsequent post-hoc t-tests were then computed to evaluate the subgroups for potential differences in variables of no-interest for the particular comparison (e.g. for age: MMSE (for cMCI also for TTC) and vice versa). If one of the tests indicated significant differences between the subgroups (e.g. significantly lower MMSE scores in younger AD), subjects with the extreme values in the corresponding group (in this case low MMSE scores) were replaced by some of the subjects left for matching and showing similar age values but higher MMSE scores. The statistical tests were then recomputed. If a test again revealed significant differences the subgroup size was reduced by removing from each subgroup one subject showing \"extreme\" relative values as compared to the mean of the subgroup in the significant variable of no interest. This procedure of replacing subjects or removing one subject from each subgroup was then repeated until matching in variables of no interest was achieved for each group and each subgroup splitting. FDG-PET and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) data of each subgroup were compared separately with the entire group of control subjects. Additionally, subgroups were matched for gender. There were no significant differences in the distribution of the FDG-PET protocols between the obtained subgroups. All subgroup comparisons of AD, cMCI and ncMCI subjects with healthy controls were performed using a full factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) design controlling for gender and total intracranial volume (for VBM). Total intracranial volume was calculated by counting all voxels in a sum image of grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid probability maps of each subject exceeding an absolute threshold of 0.2. This volume measurement was then recomputed into litres. In this, the three clinical subgroups (depending on split for age, symptom severity or TTC [only for cMCI]) and the control group were entered as independent factors. T-contrasts were used to evaluate differences between subgroups and control subjects. In contrast to classical parametric analyses, subgroup comparisons also provide the possibility to detect more complex relationships between age, symptom severity and TTC and differences observed in both imaging modalities. Such a complex relationship would be for example an increase in glucose hypometabolism only in middle-aged but not in younger or older AD patients. This kind of u-shaped relationships would not be detected by a regression analysis. A significance threshold of p b 0.001 uncorrected at voxel-level and p b 0.05 FWE-corrected for multiple comparisons at cluster level accounting for non-stationary smoothness in imaging data (as suggested for voxel-based morphometry data, Worsley et al., 1999; Hayasaka et al., 2004) was used for all imaging contrasts. This approach has been explicitly suggested for VBM analyses. It is based on the random field theory and is determining for any chosen voxelbased statistical threshold a corresponding cluster extent threshold which each cluster has to exceed taking into account i) the voxel-wise statistical threshold, ii) the smoothness of the data and iii) the total amount of comparisons.\nAs in our study we further aimed to investigate differences in the extent of atrophy and glucose hypometabolism related to age, symptom severity and TTC in the subgroups, the extents of detected differences within each modality between different conditions and between the modalities for each condition were compared to each other using two proportions z-tests. Thereby the total amount of detected significant voxels for each comparison was expressed as a proportion relative to the total amount of voxels within the statistical mask. Further, as the difference in proportions of significant voxels is highly dependent on the chosen significance threshold (e.g. at a high threshold the same difference in cluster extent is less likely than at a lower threshold) and on data smoothness, the sample size was calculated as the total amount of tested voxels scaled by a factor calculated as the number of expected clusters times number of expected voxels per cluster. This information about number and extent of expected clusters is provided within the SPM software in the statistical evaluation of each contrast and is based on estimates of data smoothness and the chosen statistical threshold. For these comparisons a statistical threshold of p b .05 Bonferroni corrected for the total amount of comparisons within each group was chosen."}, {"section_title": "Parametric analyses", "text": "To additionally evaluate parametric differences related to age, symptom severity and TTC in FDG-PET and sMRI we performed three regression analyses for each of the modalities using either only AD, cMCI or ncMCI subjects.

An important aspect of our study is the focus on detection of the link between the spatial extent of AD related imaging pathology and age, symptom severity and TTC. This focus on spatial extents of pathology contrasts our study from previous research targeting rather the correlational link between these variables and the grade of glucose hypometabolism or atrophy at each particular voxel/region. Both types of relationships are rather independent. For example a reduction of neural function in a particular region under a particular threshold might have an impact on cognitive performance. However, any further increase in AD pathology in the very same region might not have any additional effect on cognition and would be therefore not detected by a correlational analysis. In this case only additional impairment of other brain regions would lead to further cognitive decline. By comparing all patient groups to the same control group and adjusting for healthy aging we further for the first time account for the potential confounding effect of the use of different control groups that was neglected in previous research.\nThe cMCI and ncMCI differ in the amount of glucose hypometabolism and brain atrophy explained by age and symptom severity with cMCI resembling AD patients. We confirm previous findings of a correlation between TTC and glucose metabolism as well as an inverse relationship between age increase and amount of atrophy and hypometabolism associated with a particular symptom severity in AD (Matsunari et al., 2007; Salmon et al., 2000) . Given that we account for differences associated with healthy aging, our findings of differences in the amount of glucose hypometabolism and atrophy in AD subgroups subdivided by age can be interpreted as pathological age-specific add-ons that relate to a degree of functional impairment. Our study results in three important findings. Firstly, the differential age-related glucose hypometabolism and atrophy patterns between clinical groups have implications for the use of neuroimaging biomarkers for improving diagnostic accuracy and prediction of conversion to AD. While FDG-PET is the dominant biomarker in young cMCI and atrophy is mainly restricted to the hippocampus, the pattern observed in old cMCI is of prominent atrophy associated with equally marked glucose hypometabolism. This observation is consistent with a relative diagnostic superiority of FDG-PET compared to sMRI in younger patients with mild AD symptoms (Kawachi et al., 2006; Matsunari et al., 2007) . The age-related differential pattern of abnormality discovered with FDG-PET and sMRI supports previous findings of better diagnostic performance with FDG-PET only in early-onset AD patients, but equivalent performance for the two in elderly patients (Matsunari et al., 2007) .\nThe second finding concerns the relationship between symptom severity as measured by classical screening and the progression of changes in FDG-PET and sMRI. We demonstrate for cMCI and AD patients a strong link between symptom severity and the amount of atrophy, which is not evident in ncMCI. Interestingly, no such pattern was seen in glucose metabolism with any of the patient cohorts. This result indicates that changes measured by sMRI are more strongly related to the current symptom severity in AD patients.\nA third, more surprising result was obtained when MCI converters were split by TTC. We expected that symptom severity and TTC would be strongly linked, as neuropsychological measurements are used to determine AD stage. However, the measurements are only weakly correlated, which suggests that different mechanisms produce current (as measured by MMSE) and future cognitive states (as measured by TTC). Thus, a comparison of TTC duration subgroups with healthy control subjects showed a TTC-dependant amount of glucose hypometabolism, but no relationship with the amount of atrophy. The link between FDG-PET measurements and subsequent cognitive decline is consistent with previous reports showing the superiority of FDG-PET compared to neuropsychological measurements for prediction of subsequent cognitive decline and conversion to AD in MCI patients (Arnaiz et al., 2001; Ch\u00e9telat et al., 2005; Hinrichs et al., 2011) .\nThe differential results for TTC and symptom severity-related differences observed with FDG-PET and sMRI cannot be explained by different pathologies or other factors because the cMCI subgroups came from splitting the same group of subjects.\nThe current view of the progression of FDG-PET and sMRI changes in AD is that functional abnormalities occur earlier than those with sMRI (Jack et al., 2010) . Our results suggest a modification of the current model of biomarker changes related to progression from MCI to AD (Jack et al., 2010) . Imaging abnormalities appear at an early stage in sMRI as well as FDG-PET; however, structural changes are restricted mainly to the hippocampus. In contrast, but consistent with the suggested model, glucose hypometabolism progresses rapidly in this early stage of AD. The model suggested by Jack et al. further implies that the magnitude of biomarker changes is equal in both FDG-PET and structural MRI data (Jack et al., 2010) . The assumption behind this idea is that structural changes follow functional changes. In contrast, our data suggest that FDG-PET changes reach their peak already at the MCI stage (Figs. 2 and 3 ) and do not further increase but rather decrease (e.g. because the preserved tissue is maintaining its functional activity level) at later disease stages when adjusting for atrophy effects using PVE correction. In contrast, atrophy further increases at later AD stages in our study population and even extends to regions not showing any significant hypometabolism. For this reason we expect that if one would not use PVE correction, one would observe further reductions in glucose hypometabolism even in AD in agreement with Jack et al (2010) .\nAlthough the results of our study are relevant to improving understanding of progression from MCI to AD, some limitations need consideration to enable valid interpretation. Firstly, we used the same clinical groups to examine different variables of interest, with splitting into different subgroups depending on expression of the variables of interest. Therefore, the results may be confounded by between-group differences in uncontrolled factors such as functional asymmetries, intelligence quotient and other more specific cognitive domains associated with Alzheimer's disease. Such differences in uncontrolled factors might have contributed to the observed differences in the amount of atrophy and hypometabolism and shall be overcome in future large-scale longitudinal studies. Secondly, although subgroup comparisons for confounding variables were not significant in ANOVAs, they could have contributed to the differential results. We feel this is unlikely to have introduced any systematic bias, as the between-group differences were small and restricted to only one of the subgroups.\nWhen removing the variance explained by healthy ageing in the imaging data we make the explicit assumption of linearity of age related differences in GM volume and glucose metabolism. This issue has been a major focus of several large scale volumetric and PET studies performed in the past two decades (Gonoi et al., 2009; Good et al., 2001; Loessner et al., 1995; Smith et al., 2007) . All of these studies provided strong evidence that linear as compared to more complex models are sufficient to describe global and local atrophy and glucose metabolism reductions observed in the course of normal ageing (from the age of 20 to 100 years. Our assumption is therefore in line with previous research performed on that topic. Nonetheless, imprecisions of the applied voxel-wise healthy ageing models e.g. due to wrong linearity assumptions are a general possible confounding effect for studying agespecific differences in diseased populations. In this framework it is also important to note that age-related findings we report in our study only reflect cross-sectional differences in sMRI and FDG-PET between differently aged AD/MCI patient groups. They should therefore not be confused with within subject longitudinal changes related to AD progression.\nA further limitation of our study is that a proportion of control subjects used in our study might have a preclinical AD pathology. The inclusion of such subjects could have lowered the effects observed in subgroup comparisons and therefore lead to an underestimation of the amount of AD pathology. Similarly, one cannot exclude that also some of the ncMCI would have converted to AD (or reverted from MCI to normal range) if followed for a longer time period. As indicated in previous studies on MCI with a follow-up of 10 years more than 80% of MCI are expected to convert to AD in the long term (Visser et al., 2006) . Current ADNI group assignments should be therefore considered carefully and the results need to be validated using cohorts with a longer follow-up than currently available from the ADNI. However, this limitation is common to all imaging studies including not pathologically proven AD patients and control subjects. Furthermore, as we compare all subgroups exactly to the same control group, the potential inclusion of control subjects with preclinical AD would affect all comparisons in the same way without introducing a bias towards a specific subgroup. Also the finding of only a very weak link between TTC and symptom severity in our cohort requires careful interpretation. TTC is only a crude and general estimate of cognitive function. It is therefore likely that some more specific cognitive tests might be more closely related to disease progression as indicated by TTC. It is important to note that all differential results reported in our study are detected by comparing all patient subgroups to the same control group. We therefore provide only indirect evidence for between-subgroup differences. In contrast, the direct subgroup comparisons were not significant. These findings therefore need to be validated in future studies by direct comparisons of patient subgroups using larger data sets than currently available from ADNI and preferably in longitudinal study designs.\nIn our study we observed a slight decrease in sensitivity of FDG-PET at later as compared to earlier AD stages. We interpret this effect as an interaction of pathophysiology with the PVE correction performed in our study. However, this effect might be also caused by methodical artifacts, e.g. due to intensity normalisation (cerebellar metabolism is known to decline in AD) or due to increasing inaccuracy of PVE correction caused by increasing cortical atrophy and associated problems with accurate MRI segmentation.\nOur results have potential implications for the selection of biomarkers, MCI staging and for treatment evaluation. While FDG-PET appears to be a more sensitive biomarker of disease progression at the MCI stage, structural differences as measured by sMRI seem to be more strongly linked to the current global cognitive state, potentially reflecting irreversible damage. Therefore, we suggest that for treatment evaluation it may be crucial to use both structural and functional biomarkers.\nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at http://dx. "}]
