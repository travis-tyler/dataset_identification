Accelerating rates of sea level rise (SLR) (Jevrejeva et al., 2014), increased tropical cyclone frequency and intensity (Walsh et al., 2016), and variations in sediment supplies (Gabriel and Kreutzwiser, 2000) have contributed to beach erosion, shoreline migrations, and / or submergence of barrier islands in many coastal zones (Morton, 2008;Rodriguez et al., 2018;Salzmann et al., 2013). Additionally, the dredging of shipping channels for navigation and the installation of artificial coastal structures around barrier islands have altered patterns of sediment delivery (Byrnes et al, 2013;Edwards, 2006;Morton, 2008;Otvos and Carter, 2008). In the United States, barrier island chains located along the northern GOM perimeter are considered among the most vulnerable to erosion or submergence (Eisemann, 2016;Eisemann et al, 2018;Otvos and Carter, 2013), due to a combination of these environmental and anthropogenic forces. Thus, GOM barrier island management and policy decisions should be based on available scientific data (Dolan and Wallace, 2012)."}, {"section_title": "3D", "text": "Of particular concern to the northern GOM community are the Mississippi-Alabama (MS-AL) barrier island chain. Previous work examining changes on decadal to centennial scales concluded the MS-AL barrier islands have undergone long-term shoreline erosion (Byrnes et al., 1991;Morton et al., 2004;Waller and Malbrough, 1976) and significant land area reductions since the mid-1800's (Otvos and Carter, 2013;Morton, 2008;Waller and Malbrough, 1976). The primary causes of deterioration include tropical cyclone impacts, sediment budget deficits, SLR, and human activities (Byrnes et al., 2013; overwhelming focus analyzing changes before and after major storm events (Fritz et al., 2007;Froede, 2006;Jones, 2015;Morton, 2010;Morton and Sallenger, 2003;Schmid, 2003). A study by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) determined the long-term (~150 yrs) shoreline change rate for Mississippi was -2.3 m/yr (15 year, short-term rate of -2.1 m/yr), and for Alabama -0.4 m/yr (20 year, short-term rate +0.3 m/yr) (Morton et al., 2004). While this method of coastal monitoring provides quantitative analyses of shoreline change in a two-dimensional (2D) plane, it omits the spatial changes occurring on barrier islands' interiors (e.g., dunes, ridges, swales, ponds and lagoons). By incorporating threedimensional (3D) barrier island changes, highly dynamic spatial and temporal processes can be quantified. This study seeks to extend the current state of knowledge by concentrating on two of the six MS-AL barrier islands, Horn and Petit Bois islands ( fig. 1). The unique approach taken in this study is the use of multi-year, 3D, high-resolution LIDAR data to analyze the geomorphic responses of the islands before and after tropical cyclone impacts, including periods with minimal to no storm activity. This technique was first employed on the MS- and Petit Bois islands will then be compared with those of Ship Island, allowing us to better understand the complex responses of barrier islands to variations in sediment supply, sea 3 level rise, and storm impacts. Lessons learned from this study have global implications, as there is a dearth of high-resolution, yet large spatial scale volumetric analyses for numerous barrier islands in a single chain. between the Mississippi Sound and the northern GOM water bodies (Eleuterius, 1978)."}, {"section_title": "Regional Setting", "text": "The islands are composed of 50 to 100% fine to pebble-sized (0.21 to 4 mm) quartz sand (Waller and Malbrough, 1976;Cipriani and Stone, 2001), 2 to 50% silt to medium-grained 4 (0.061 to 0.495 mm) heavy minerals (Foxworth et al., 1962;Cipriani and Stone, 2001), and <2% calcium carbonate shells (Cipriani and Stone, 2001). The initiation of the MS-AL barrier chain took place between 6 ka and 4 ka years BP (Hollis, 2018;Otvos, 2005) when the western side of incipient Dauphin Island, anchored by the Pleistocene Gulfport Formation (Otvos, 1985), intersected with landward migrating marine shoals at a ~2 mm/yr SLR rate. As SLR decelerated below 2 mm/yr, the in-situ shoals received enough sediment from alongshore and offshore sources to vertically accrete and stabilize (Hollis, 2018), forming modern day Dauphin Island. Horn Island formed ~4.5 ka years BP at a ~1 mm/yr SLR rate (Gal, 2018). Sand sourced primarily from the ravinement of the Biloxi and Pascagoula river paleochannels south of Horn Island contributed considerably to its evolution (Gal, 2018). Ship Island and the eastern part of Cat Island formed ~4.6 ka years BP as westward littoral transport facilitated the vertical aggradation of Mississippi shoals over preexisting Holocene sandy-muds (Otvos, 1985(Otvos, , 2001). The extent of westward progradation of the barrier islands ceased when it encountered the advancing St. Bernard delta lobe of the southeast Louisiana coast, ~3.8 ka -1.8 ka years BP (Twichell et al., 2013). Evidence of intense hurricanes impacting the northern GOM have been geologically documented between ~2200 to 1900 and ~900 to 600 years BP by Bregy et al. (2018), and modern day Petit Bois Island was given its own designation following a hurricane-induced separation from Dauphin Island in the late 18 th century (Otvos, 1979;Waller and Malbrough, 1976). The sixth \"island\", West Petit Bois Island (WPBI), originated as spoils of dredging operations from the Pascagoula Shipping Channel between 1917 and 1920 (Byrnes et al., 2013). In May 2018, WPBI was officially 5 added to the National Park Service's Gulf Island National Seashore (Everitt, 2018), which previously included western Cat, Ship, Horn, and Petit Bois islands. The MS-AL barrier chain is set in a subtropical climate on a passive margin. Surface winds are predominately from the east (E) and southeast (SE) between April and August, from the south (S) in July, and from the E and northeast (NE) between September and March (Byrnes et al., 1991;Zavala-Hidalgo et al., 2014;Waller and Malbrough, 1976). The islands experience significant wave heights averaged between 0.4 and 0.7 m (Byrnes et al., 2013), and diurnal tides ranging between 0.3 and 0.6 m (Waller and Malbrough, 1976). Meteorological systems in this region greatly influence the geomorphology of the MS-AL barrier islands. Under moderate conditions, the wave climate controls a net sediment flux of 230,000 -305,000 m 3 /yr via littoral drift (Byrnes et al., 2013). However, during periods of severe weather, increased water levels exacerbate normal wave heights (Byrnes et al, 1991) causing dune and shoreface erosion. Severe weather systems include tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones, and cold fronts. Of these three systems, tropical cyclones have been acknowledged to cause the most discernible changes to the sediment budgets of the islands (Jones, 2015;Morton and Sallenger, 2003;Otvos and Carter, 2008). This is because their high velocity, sustained surface winds and gusts (>119 kph) (NOAA, 2012) initiate dune blowouts (Gabriel and Kreutzwiser, 2000), and generate high energy waves and storm surges, leading to island fragmentation, island breaching, overwash, (Otvos and Carter, 2008;Morton, 2010), inundation (Fritz et al., 2007;Sallenger, 2000), and / or saltwater flooding (Waller and Malbrough, 1976). The less severe, yet more frequently occurring extratropical cyclones and cold fronts are accompanied with 6 directional-shifting, mild to moderate (with occasionally gusting) surface winds and lowerenergy waves (Masselink and van Hateren, 2014) which have been recognized as erosive (Keen, 2002), restorative (Chaney, 1999), or adjusting (Stone et al., 2004) forces to the barrier islands.  Byrnes et al. (1991) due to its resiliency to tropical cyclone impacts, relative to the other islands. They determined that from 1849 to 1986 Horn Island sustained no breaches or major shoreline alterations and had the least cumulative percent change (15%) in its land area during that time (Byrnes et al., 1991). On a short-term time scale, 1976scale, to 1986scale, , Byrnes et al. (1991 found that Horn Island's rate of areal change was -6.4 hectares/yr (or -0.064 km 2 /yr). These findings were later corroborated in similar studies by Morton (2008), showing a 19% land area change for the period of 1849 through 2007, and a short-7 term change rate of -5.7 hectares/yr (or -0.057 km 2 /yr) between 1986 and 1998 (Morton, 2007). In a more recent study, Gal (2018) found that the continued stabilization of the island is due to sand sourced from the ravinement of two incised valley paleochannels which converge and intersect Horn Island.  Otvos (1979) and Waller and Malbrough (1976) suggested that an unnamed hurricane, sometime between 1740 and 1794, segmented the island in two. Since then, Petit Bois Island has been migrating laterally to the west via updrift erosion and downdrift accretion (Byrnes et al, 1991) between episodes of tropical cyclone impacts. Its short-term areal change rates were found to be -2.8 hectares/yr (or -0.028 km 2 /yr) between 1976 and 1986 (Byrnes et al., 1991) and -10.0 hectares/yr (or -0.1 km 2 /yr) between 1986 and 1998 (Morton, 2007). Petit Bois Island's western flank is currently abutting the Pascagoula Shipping Channel, preventing its continued westward migration due to ongoing dredging operations by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Byrnes et al., 2013)."}, {"section_title": "Study Sites", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Cyclone History", "text": "During the study period (2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015)(2016) passed to the west of the islands, meaning they experienced the \"right sides\" of the tropical 8 cyclones. In the northern hemisphere, the right sides of tropical cyclones are where the strongest winds and storm surges are produced (Landsea, 2014). In these instances, the islands would have been subjected to more erosive forces than those storms passing to the islands' east (Fearnley et al., 2009), such as in the cases of Hurricane Ivan 2004 "}, {"section_title": "2011, 2016", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Berg, 2013", "text": "Listing and descriptions of tropical cyclones passing within a 220 km radius of Horn and Petit Bois islands, and the dates of pre-and post-storm LIDAR datasets used for analysis."}, {"section_title": "Research Objectives", "text": "Previous studies of MS-AL barrier island evolution resulting from variations in sediment supply, rising seas, tropical cyclone impacts, and human activities have considered areal (Byrnes et al., 1991;Morton, 2008;Otvos and Carter, 2013;Waller and Malbrough, 1976), volumetric (Byrnes et al., 2013, Eisemann et al., 2018, and shoreline (Morton et al., 2004;Waller and Malbrough, 1976) changes. With areal and volumetric differences providing a holistic quantification of island change through time (Buijsman et al., 2003;Eisemann et al., 2018), shoreline analysis can identify where isolated portions of the coastline may be experiencing retreat or advancement. This study seeks to add to the current state of knowledge (Waller and Malbrough, 1976;Byrnes et al., 1991;Morton, 2007Morton, , 2008Otvos and Carter, 2013) by quantifying the rates of shoreline change, and the differences in volume and area on Horn and Petit Bois islands between 2004 and 2016. Specifically, instances of immediate geomorphic changes that resulted from the hyperactive 2005 hurricane season versus the following eleven years of mild to inactive 11 hurricane seasons, when local meteorological and oceanographic conditions drove geomorphic changes. In doing so, this study will test three hypotheses: H1 -Given the expectation that Horn Island is Mississippi's most stable island (Byrnes et al., 1991), it is hypothesized that the island platform will rebound to prestorm sediment volume levels following high wave energy events. H2 -As a consequence of existing erosional trends, Petit Bois Island will not have sufficient recovery time between periods of high wave energy events.

These 3D, high-resolution datasets provide continuous surfaces across a wide geographic area, allowing for the differences in elevation, shoreline positions, sediment volume, and area of the barrier island platforms to be calculated over the 12.5-year study period. LIDAR data analyses were conducted for five periods: -December 2005, December 2005-June 2007, June 2007-June 2011, June 2011-October 2016, and the entire period from April 2004 to October 2016. The first period (2004 -2005) captured two cycles of the North Atlantic hurricane seasons, which included three major (category 3 or higher) tropical cyclone impacts to the northern GOM, while the following three periods had 0 to 2 tropical cyclones per year (category 2 or lower) during the next 11 hurricane seasons.

The reported maximum vertical uncertainty of all five datasets was 20 cm, and the maximum horizontal uncertainty was 100 cm (table 2). These uncertainty values are primarily associated with collection errors in the onboard aircraft equipment, including the GPS, the inertial navigation unit, and the unit which points the direction of the laser (Hodgson and Bresnahan, 2004;Lentz and Hapke, 2011). Quality control of post-processed LIDAR data can be assessed by calculating the horizontal and vertical offsets between multiple datasets using a stationary structure within the confines of the respective study area (Eisemann et al., 2018;Lentz and Hapke, 2011). The present study area did not contain a permanent structure to apply this quality control assessment to, so using methods from Eisemann et al. 2018, the five datasets were plotted over Fort Massachusetts on Ship Island, and the vertical error was measured at \u00b10.09 m.

Horn"}, {"section_title": "59", "text": "Island's average subaerial area and total average shoreline change rates were relatively small for the overall study period, -0.07 km 2 /yr and -2 m/yr respectively. Petit Bois Island also exhibited net erosional trends between 2004 and 2016. The average rate of change to Petit Bois' subaerial area was -0.03 km 2 /yr, while its shoreline change rate was -3.1 m/yr, and its subaerial sediment volume change rate was -1.23 x 10 4 m 3 /yr (tables 7 and 8). In addition to these trends, Petit Bois Island somewhat reoriented during this period and experienced in-place island narrowing and lengthening. The extent of this in-place narrowing on Petit Bois' south-central and southeastern shorelines are exemplified in transects PB2 ( fig. 16) and PB3 ( fig. 17). The rates at which the shoreline retreated between 2004 and 2016 on transect PB2 was ~9 m/yr, and on PB3 was ~8 m/yr. Mean wind speeds (Appendix table 3) of the study periods did not vary significantly, thus they did not appear to have a direct correlation with observed spatial changes on Horn and Petit Bois islands. There also did not appear to be a correlation with respect to mean wind speed and accretion / erosion. It was observed, however, that for periods where the dominant wind direction was out of the SE, erosion occurred, and when the dominant direction was out of the ENE, accretion occurred. Several clear trends were observed with regards to wave energies and their effects on the islands' geomorphologies. First, the highest mean wave (0.485 \u00b1 1.44 kJ/m 2 ) energy for a single period was observed in period 1 . During this period, both Horn and Petit Bois islands experienced the largest amounts of erosion and land loss to their areas and volumes. Second, when the islands experienced instances of high wave energies >10 kJ/m 2 , 60 accompanying storm surge heights of at least 1 m generated erosion to low-lying areas of Horn and Petit Bois islands."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Area and shoreline positions of the MS-AL barrier islands have been surveyed since the 1800's. Figure 25 shows the historical subaerial area sizes of Horn and Petit Bois islands since 1848/49, indicating negative trends. Horn Island has lost ~3 to 3.5 km 2 in the past ~170 years, while Petit Bois Island has lost ~4 to 4.5 km 2 in the same amount of time (Waller and Malbrough, 1976;Byrnes et al, 1991;Morton, 2007Morton, & 2008Carter et al., 2018); including data from this study. Short-term areal change rates found during this study were -0.07 km 2 /yr for Horn Island and -0.03 km 2 /yr for Petit Bois Island. These values were within 0.07 km 2 /yr of the USGS's (Morton, 2007) findings between 1986 and 1998. Short-term changes of shoreline positions of the MS barrier islands were also measured at a mean rate of -2.1 m/yr, between 1986 and 2001 (Morton et al., 2004). Here, Horn Island's shoreline change rate was -2 m/yr and Petit Bois Island's rate was -3 m/yr. Since Horn and Petit Bois islands have no history of artificial restorations, island growth or stability is limited by the amount of sediment supplied by natural processes. Byrnes et al. (2013) measured the bathymetric sediment flux of the MS-AL barrier islands between 1917/20 and 2005/10 and concluded there was a net deficit of ~3.38 x 10 5 m 3 between the western ends of Dauphin and Horn islands. Even with limited bathymetric datasets for this study, we also found a net sediment deficit between Horn and Petit Bois islands. Lastly, the geomorphic responses of Horn and Petit Bois islands were compared with those of Ship Island, MS (figure 26). All three islands experienced severe erosion from the tropical cyclone impacts of the 2004-05 hurricane seasons. In the years following these storms, Ship Island (from 2007 to 2012) naturally recovered 0.56 km 2 (14.4%) of its prehurricane Ivan subaerial area (Eisemann et al., 2018); and, from 2005 to 2016 Horn Island recovered 0.88 km 2 (6.6%) of it pre-Ivan subaerial area, whereas Petit Bois Island recovered 0.16 km 2 (4%) of its pre-Ivan subaerial area. Net topographic and bathymetric sediment volume losses on Ship Island, from 2004 to 2012, were 4.1 x 10 6 m 3 (average loss 500,000 62 m 3 /yr) (Eisemann et al., 2018), while between 2004 and 2016, net topographic sediment loss on Horn Island was 5.36 x 10 6 m 3 (average loss of 429,000 m 3 /yr) and on Petit Bois Island net topographic sediment loss was 1.54 x 10 5 m 3 (average loss of 12,300 m 3 /yr). These trends show Horn, Petit Bois, and Ship islands are responding similarly to sea-level rise, storm impacts, and sediment supply variations over short timescales. "}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER V -CONCLUSIONS", "text": "This study quantified the differences in subaerial area, subaerial sediment volume, bathymetric water volume, and shoreline change rates of Horn and Petit Bois islands to understand their geomorphic responses and recoveries to tropical cyclone impacts between 2004 and 2016. Horn Island lost a minimum of 6.09 x 10 6 m 3 of sediment volume during the high energy events of the 2004-05 hurricane seasons, mainly on its interior dunes, and eastern and western tips. Following these tropical cyclone impacts, Horn Island slowly began rebuilding part of its eastern and western tips, and southern foredunes, yet continued to lose sediment in its interior for an additional six years (2005 to 2011), due to aeolian erosion. Since, Horn Island was only able to recover ~4.3% of the lost subaerial sediment volume (relative to 2004) from 2005 to 2016, it is concluded that the island is no longer stable, and that Holocene shoreface ravinement processes are not contributing significant amounts of sand (Gal, 2018) to the island fast enough to keep pace with the current rate of loss. Petit Bois Island, on the other hand, recouped ~22.9% of its 2004 (pre-Ivan) subaerial sediment volume between 2005 and 2016. Most of these gains were to the island's low-lying interior, at the expense of its southern foreshore. Furthermore, because Petit Bois Island's narrow center was only 242.9 m in 2016 and narrowing at a rate of ~9 m/yr, the island is vulnerable to breaching during the next storm. Also, when considering the responses of the islands' area and shoreline changes to that of volume changes, the relationship was inconsistent. About 60% of the time, when Horn and Petit Bois islands' areas and shorelines increased or decreased, so did the volume. The other ~40% of the time, the volume change trend was opposite to that of the areas and shorelines. These findings indicate the assessment of an island cannot be based on a singular parameter (such as either area or volume alone), but that their longevity ultimately depends on both the amount of area an island occupies coupled with the quantity of sediment volume it retains."}]
