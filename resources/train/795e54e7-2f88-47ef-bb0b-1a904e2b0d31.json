[{"section_title": "| INTRODUCTION", "text": "The 2019 Coronavirus outbreak is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which affects the respiratory system. 1, 2 The disease was first identified in Hubei Province, People Republic of China, in late 2019 and has spread globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared 3 it as a global pandemic on 11 March 2020; however, by then COVID-19 had already spread to over 100 countries and infected more than 100 000 people, taking over 4000 lives. By 10 April 2020, this outbreak has affected more than 1 560 000 people across the globe (https:// ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data). The virus is primarily spread from person-to-person via close contact, either through small droplets released during sneezing, coughing, or talking. 4 The world had already experienced a COVID-19 like pandemic situation a century ago (ie, 1918-1919) , regarding H1N1 influenza (commonly known as Spanish flu). 5 During the H1N1 pandemic, some countries, particularly the United States, tried a range of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)-measures intended to shrink the spread by avoiding person-to-person contact in the general population. 6 For any epidemic or pandemic various national 7 and international laws [8] [9] [10] are available for slowing down the spread of any infectious disease. Laws should have been prioritized as per the requirement of the situation and supplement the other measures that to be taken in a public healthemergency 10, 11 to control the spread of the infection;\nwhereas, law-enforcement takes the action or activity compliance with the objective stated in law, and it includes over governmental bodies like police officials, government officials or officers, etc. Governmental bodies have also tried to reduce the transmission of infectious diseases through the legislative system (International Health Regulations 1981, 12 2005 13 ; National Health Act, 2003 13 ). 14, 15, 16 Law can also contribute to the prevention of infectious diseases by improving access to vaccinations, 17,18 facilitating screening, 12, 19 counselling, and education of those at risk of infection. Additionally, law has a responsive role, such as supporting access to treatment, empowering public health authorities to reduce contact with infectious individuals, and to exercise emergency powers in response to disease outbreaks. Essential treatment orders should restrict individual liberty only to the extent necessary to most effectively reduce the risks to public health. 12 The consequences of infectious disease can also induce negative economic effects, leading to economic instability and poor socio-economic growth. 20, 21 Governments in each country have come forward to support those who have suffered economic loss due to any infectious disease outbreak. [22] [23] [24] Globally, the core rationale for opting for lockdown was to protect human life from the COVID-19 infection by stopping the transmission of disease across the communities. The other purpose of lockdown was to provide health care services to those infected with COVID-19 virus as well as continuing to facilitate all other general health care facilities.\nGovernments in most of the countries have adopted lockdown and tried in all possible ways to reduce the human interaction for controlling the spread of COVID-19. However, transmission rate of COVID-19 was found to be increasing even after the implementation of lockdown. In this context, the objectives of the present study are to explore the impact of delayed planning or lack of planning for the lockdown of the country and inadequate implementation of the lockdown, on the transmission rate."}, {"section_title": "| METHODOLOGY", "text": "In order to assess the impact of lockdown against the spread of COVID-19; a multiple change point model using the Bayesian regression technique (discussed in Appendix) was adopted for describing the intermittent behaviour in number of registered cases due to the infec- "}, {"section_title": "| The data", "text": "In order to study three shifts or changes in pattern of daily COVID-19 cases, the epidemiological data on the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 cases as reported by public health authorities worldwide was accessed till 11 April 2020 from the website of Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data). For the present study, we considered date-wise number of infected cases due to COVID-19 of six selected countries: Russia, United Kingdom, India, France, Italy, and United States, where country-wide lockdown was scheduled either fully, partially, or not implemented. From an extensive reporting of COVID-19 data across the globe, about 50% of cases were registered from these selected countries. The criteria for selection of these countries were based on total number of infected cases, which was classified in three categories namely more than 100 000 cases (United States and Italy), 50 000 to 100 000 cases (United Kingdom and France), and 6000 to 10 000 cases (India and Russia). Here, the first date of reporting COVID-19 cases, corresponding to each selected country, was considered as the starting day. We have also obtained the full lockdown-related information about India, United Kingdom, France, and Italy from the online published news. Table 1 Table 1 Figure S1 ."}, {"section_title": "| RESULTS", "text": "In order to understand the impact of delaying lockdown and whether its implementation was effective on the number of daily registered cases of COVID-19 in each of the selected country, two-way comparisons are presented in Table 2 . Firstly, we compared posterior estimate of point for first change with the lockdown, which will answer the question whether the lockdown was on time. Secondly, we compared the posterior estimates of consecutive change points to review whether the lockdown was properly implemented. Here, reported days refer to days where COVID-19 cases were registered; therefore, it is different from the length of time interval. Corresponding to each of the selected countries, duration of exposure experienced (days), and number of infected cases reported on the date scheduled for lockdown, was also presented. In order to visualize the shift in pattern of daily infected cases, for each country, the number of infected cases reported on the posterior estimate of change points, first (Cp 1), second (Cp 2), and third (Cp 3), were also reported.\nThe pattern of daily infected cases and its posterior densities corresponding to each country and their change point were depicted pictorially in Figure S1 . The pattern of cumulative COVID-19 cases and its associated deaths was presented in Figure S2 .\nThe country wise change trend for reporting COVID-19 cases are described as follows.\nIn Russia, the first case of COVID-19 was registered on 31 January 2020, with the first change in trend for reporting COVID- "}]
