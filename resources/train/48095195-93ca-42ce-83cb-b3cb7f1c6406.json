While this approach is useful in understanding the contribution of specific cellular phenotypes, identifying key signal-transduction pathways and individual molecules, it does not integrate disease-induced pathophysiological changes that influence multiple brain regions and their functional interactions. The ability to define mental health diseases as circuit disorders and identify the circuits that are relevant to particular diseases can lead us to a perspective that is closer to the clinical disease state and enable us to consider interventions that can repair these circuits and restore the brainactivity network. A potential advantage with the circuit approach is that the same circuit is likely to be impaired across disorders when there is overlap in the expression of behavioral deficits.\nThe hippocampal formation (HPF) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) interact in a bidirectional manner to regulate several cognitive functions and process emotional information. They are critically important structures in the brain's memory system, facilitating fast encoding of new information, consolidation, retrieval, and organization of the memory network. 1 There is strong neural synchrony between the two regions during behavior, and their functional interaction is regulated by oscillations. 2, 3 The neural ensemble formed by the cells in the hippocampus and PFC mutually influences each other in a circuit-like fashion in modulating emotional and cognitive processes. Connections between the hippocampus and PFC have been demonstrated in rodents, [4] [5] [6] [7] primates, 8 and humans. 9 The rodent and human hippocampal prefrontal connections are illustrated schematically in Figures 1 and 2 respectively. The HPF and PFC are connected by both monosynaptic and polysynaptic connections. 10 Retrograde-labeling studies revealed that projections from the medial PFC (mPFC) robustly label neurons in the ventral hippocampus and subiculum. 10, 11 Anterograde labeling revealed connections between the CA1 region of the hippocampus and the subiculum with the mPFC. 4 Indirect multisynaptic connections between the HPF to mPFC include projections through the nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, and midline thalamus.

A complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors is also involved in disease pathophysiology. Multiple brain regions have been studied to understand the etiology of depression, including the hippocampus, amygdala, striatum, insula, medial thalamus, and several frontal cortex (FC) regions. 21 Significant attention has been focused on the hippocampus, due to its central role in the stress-induced dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. 22 Additionally, imaging studies in patients with depression have shown a reduction in hippocampal volume.

(2) The PFC influences the hippocampus indirectly through multiple relay structures. The nucleus reuniens is the main nucleus of the thalamus that receives the medial PFC information, and transmits the processed information to the hippocampus by monosynaptic projection. The nucleus reuniens of the thalamus provides excitatory projections to the distal dendrites of the neurons of the CA1. The connections between the thalamus and the PFC are reciprocal.

Structural analysis reported the strongest volumetric decreases in the DG of unmedicated MDD patients, which were partially rescued by antidepressant treatment. 34 Imaging brain regions as a function of depressive episodes showed that illness progression led to reduction in DG volume and thinning of the left mPFC, with no effect on amygdala volume. 35 A consensus picture that emerges from clinical imaging studies is that the DG is the most vulnerable hippocampal subfield in depression. It is however not known whether this is purely disease-related or if there are also predisposing genetic factors that result in the DG being preferentially affected in depression. Animal-stress studies have demonstrated that the DG is particularly sensitive to elevations in glucocorticoid levels and reduced neurogenesis in the subgranular zone. Although a reduction in neurogenesis could contribute to a reduction in DG volume, it is unlikely to be the only factor. 36 The findings give rise to several questions that will require clinical and preclinical investigation.

Understanding the link between childhood-stress exposure and brain function can thus provide critical insight into disease etiology. A significant interaction was found between childhood emotional neglect and reductions in hippocampal and PFC volumes in MDD patients, 49 which could signify an association between circuit and structural abnormalities.

Extensive volumetric and shape analyses employing a variety of methods, such as manual segmentation of the entire hippocampus, voxel-based morphometry, and surface reconstruction, have yielded a consensus that subfield atrophy in AD is primarily in CA1. 63 This finding from live imaging investigations correlates well with previous histological examination of postmortem AD brain tissue showing highest neuronal loss in CA1 (68%), followed by the subiculum (47%) and hilus (25%) compared to the age-matched control group. 64 CA1 and subiculum atrophy were detectable in cognitively normal individuals 6 years prior to AD diagnosis, 65 indicating involvement of specific hippocampal subfields early in the disease process.\nThere are broad similarities in hippocampal volume loss in AD and depression, which could underlie the overlap in affective and cognitive deficits. Structural imaging of hippocampal subfields and immunohistochemical and histological analyses have shown that there is divergence in the specific subfields and cell types that are affected. Volumetric reduction in the DG is consistently reported in depression, although the precise mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In contrast, hippocampal atrophy in AD is caused by neuronal cell loss in the CA1 region and the entorhinal cortex, while the DG is mostly well preserved. 66 Whether these differences also influence how information flows through the hippocampal circuit in these diseases would be worthy of investigation.\nAmyloid and neurofibrillary tangles, abnormally folded protein structures in the AD brain, initially accumulate in the entorhinal cortex and then spread to the hippocampus. 67 This phenomenon has the potential to disrupt local and global hippocampal-dependent connectivity. 68 Connectivity can also be impaired before the emergence of landmark pathology, such as in MCI patients who are at risk for AD, exhibiting significantly reduced connectivity between hippocampi. 69 The mPFC and lateral PFC have emerged as an AD-hub region responsible for linking functionally specialized regions. 70 As a site of high amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation, its ability to process information would be increasingly affected with disease progression. Positron-emission tomography imaging of blood flow during a face-memory task indicated that memory deficits early in AD were due to a reduction in integrated network activity, with the PFC and hippocampus as principal components. 71 Functional connectivity of the hippocampus with several cortical regions was shown to be impaired in ApoE\u03b54 carriers by a combination of neuropsychological testing and imaging analyses designed to decipher context-dependent alterations in hippocampal connectivity. 72 Early-stage AD ApoE\u03b54 carriers also exhibited decreased functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the medial FC and parietal cortex.

A functional relationship between the posterior cingulate cortex and the hippocampus was seen in episodic memory fMRI in MCI patients. Interestingly, posterior cingulate cortex activation during episodic memory encoding was connected with right hippocampal activation, while episodic memory recognition was associated with left hippocampal activation, indicating the presence of hemisphere specialization. 74 In an AD study that found a strong correlation between hippocampal volume and memory impairment, left hippocampal volume predicted verbal recall while right hippocampal volume predicted spatial recall, providing additional support for hemispheric specialization of memory in AD. 75 Neuroimaging studies in AD and depression have progressed from focused analysis of specific anatomical regions involved in disease pathology to incorporating a network approach that can yield insight into global relationships between spatially distinct brain structures, spawning the field of macrolevel circuit analysis -connectomics. 76, 77 The understanding of brain wiring gained by clinical connectomic investigations can be complemented with preclinical optogenetic technology to examine specific circuits and cell types with high spatial and temporal resolution. 78 We expand on the applications of connectomic and optogenetic approaches to interrogate the hippocampal-PFC circuit in cognitive function."}, {"section_title": "Optogenetics sheds light on the hippocampal-PFC circuit", "text": "Optogenetics is rapidly becoming the method of choice to regulate neuronal circuits precisely in preclinical experiments.

An elegant recent study employed optogenetic technology to facilitate the recall of old memories in a mouse model of AD. 83 It successfully achieved this by activating the cells involved in the formation of memory engrams, in the hippocampal circuit. 83 A similar approach was used by the same group to recall previous positive memories in a mouse model of depression. Optogenetic activation of the positive memoryengram cells in the hippocampal circuit was able to acutely reverse the depressed phenotype. 84 This experiment draws attention to the therapeutic potential of positive memory recall in depression, as activating memory of the positive experience was more effective in overcoming the adverse behavioral consequences of stress exposure than the experience itself. 85 The existence of an mPFC-thalamic nucleus reunienshippocampal CA1 loop for goal-directed spatial navigation was determined by optogenetically manipulating this circuit at multiple nodes to demonstrate the relative importance of subregions within the hippocampus. 86 The important role played by direct ventral hippocampus-mPFC afferents in encoding spatial cues during the performance of spatial working memory tasks was shown by employing a projection-specific optogenetic approach. 87 The ventral hippocampus-mPFC input was required only for encoding cues, not for retrieval or maintenance. \u03b3-Frequency but not \u03b8-frequency synchrony was essential in this circuit for successful encoding of cues, reinforcing previous work indicating that \u03b3-synchrony could be essential for proper long-range connectivity. 88 Optogenetic stimulation of somatostatin and parvalbumin containing interneurons in the PFC helped clarify the distinct contribution of these interneuron subtypes in working memory tasks and reward processing. This provided new insight of prefrontal circuitry in cognitive function. 89 The combination of optogenetics and electrophysiology sheds light on the mechanism whereby the PFC regulates the processing of information for attention. This study strongly implicates fast-spiking mPFC parvalbumin neurons in guiding successful attention behavior. 90 The therapeutic potential of optogenetics for cognitive deficits was demonstrated by \u03b3-frequency stimulation of PFC interneurons specifically at 40 or 60 Hz. 91 Interestingly, a single intervention was sufficient to produce cognitive enhancement that lasted over a week. Precise and selective activation of glutamatergic neurons in the mPFC improved associative recognition memory, an important aspect of cognitive function. 92 However, it is important to note that stimulation was effective only if it occurred during the delay phase, and simply elevating glutamate release was ineffective.

A combination of diffusion MRI to trace white-matter tracts for structural connectivity and resting-state fMRI for functional activity is being employed. 77 The hope is that conducting these analyses in over a thousand individuals will provide accurate baselines and enable identification of disease-induced alterations in brain-network connectivity with high confidence. 77 Connectomic analyses have begun to provide new insight into the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders, and it is now possible to define certain illnesses as connectivity disorders. Reduced functional connectivity, determined by functional connectivity MRI, has been reported in advanced AD, with patients demonstrating a striking decrease in connectivity between the hippocampus and FC. 99 Altered functional connectivity is also evident early in AD, 73 when plaque accumulation would be minimal. Long-distance connectivity was shown to be selectively vulnerable in AD, and deterioration correlated with cognitive decline. Graph theory-based topological analysis revealed that attenuation in long-distance connectivity also reduced the efficiency of the global brain network, leading to more widespread clinical cognitive deficits. 100 In patients afflicted with CI and depression, there is substantial overlap of connectivity abnormalities. Networktopology analyses reveal a reduction in network strength, efficiency, and regional connectivity in FC structures, collectively indicating disruption of white-matter integrity. 54 In patients with a first episode of untreated depression, white-matter abnormalities can be a potential biomarker of pathophysiology. If compromised white-matter integrity and function are indeed precipitating factors in depression, it would be important to examine the role of antidepressants in rescuing or reversing these deficits. Ketamine has attracted much attention in recent years, due to its rapid-acting antidepressant properties. 101 Its psychomimetic effects and abuse potential can however interfere with its use as a mainstream antidepressant in the clinic. Understanding its precise antidepressant mechanism is thus a high priority to develop next-generation compounds that do not carry undesirable side effects. A recent study on the role of ketamine in MDD patients demonstrated its ability to normalize disconnectivity between the PFC and the rest of the brain, suggesting that actions on white matter could be involved in its antidepressant mechanism. 102 Although this suggests that impaired connectivity can be rescued, it is critical to understand ketamine's impact on white matter. Efforts should be aimed at distinguishing between acute and chronic effects, as chronic ketamine usage has been shown to disrupt connectivity between the caudate and PFC. 103 Focusing attention on understanding the molecular substrates that influence white-matter integrity would be an important research avenue. It can yield useful information regarding circuit neurobiology, and also potentially identify molecules that can restore connectivity deficits in multiple psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.
