[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Stable MR acquisition is essential for reliable measurement of brain atrophy in longitudinal studies. One attractive recent advance in MRI is to speed up acquisition using parallel imaging (e.g. reducing volumetric T1-weighted acquisition scan times from around 9 to 5 min). In some studies, a decision to change to an accelerated acquisition may have been deliberately taken, while in others repeat scans may occasionally be accidentally acquired with an accelerated acquisition. In ADNI, non-accelerated and accelerated scans were acquired in the same scanning session on each individual. We investigated the impact on brain atrophy as measured by k-means normalized boundary shift integral (KN-BSI) and deformation-based morphometry when changing from non-accelerated to accelerated MRI acquisitions over a 12-month interval using scans of 422 subjects from ADNI. KN-BSIs were calculated using both a non-accelerated baseline scan and non-accelerated 12-month scans (i.e. consistent acquisition), and a non-accelerated baseline scan and an accelerated 12-month scan (i.e. changed acquisition). Fluidbased non-rigid registration was also performed on those scans to estimate the brain atrophy rate. We found that the effect on KN-BSI and fluid-based non-rigid registration depended on the scanner manufacturer. For KN-BSI, in Philips and Siemens scanners, the change had very little impact on the measured atrophy rate (increase of 0.051% in Philips and \u2212 0.035% in Siemens from consistent acquisition to changed acquisition), whereas, in GE, the change caused a mean reduction of 0.65% in the brain atrophy rate. This is likely due to the difference in tissue contrast between gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid in the non-accelerated and accelerated scans in GE, which uses IR-FSPGR instead of MP-RAGE. For fluid-based non-rigid registration, the change caused a mean increase of 0.29% in the brain atrophy rate in the changed acquisition compared with consistent acquisition in Philips, whereas in GE and Siemens, the change had less impact on the mean atrophy rate (increase of 0.18% in GE and 0.049% in Siemens). Moving from non-accelerated baseline scans to accelerated scans for follow-up may have surprisingly little effect on computed atrophy rates depending on the exact sequence details and the scanner manufacturer; even accidentally inconsistent scans of this nature may still be useful."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Rates of brain atrophy measured from serial MRI are increasingly used to track disease progression for diagnostic purposes and clinical trials (Johnson et al., 2012; Salloway et al., 2014) .

This may be impractical for studies of slow-progressing diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's disease) that may go on over 10 years (Bateman et al., 2011) . Also, sequence innovations and hardware improvements may mean that there are reasons to change: one attractive recent advance in MRI is to speed up acquisition using parallel imaging methods (reducing volumetric T1-weighted acquisition from approximately 9 to 5 min). This frees up scanner time to allow additional scans, or the reduced scan time may reduce patient attrition rate. In some studies, a decision to change to an accelerated acquisition may be beneficial, while in others repeat scans may occasionally be accidentally acquired with an accelerated acquisition. Popular techniques for the calculation of the brain atrophy rate include the boundary shift integral (BSI) (Freeborough and Fox, 1997) and deformation-based morphometry (Freeborough and Fox, 1998; Avants et al., 2008; Hua et al., 2011; Holland et al., 2011; Lorenzi et al., 2013) . After registering two serial MR volumetric scans, the BSI directly estimates the change in brain volume using the difference in voxel intensities between the two scans. A change in acquisition protocol (e.g. changing from non-accelerated to accelerated acquisition) is likely to cause a change in image characteristics such as tissue contrast and signal-to-noise ratio, which will have an effect on BSI (Preboske et al., 2006) . K-means normalized BSI (KN-BSI) can provide a more robust measurement of brain atrophy by using tissue-specific intensity normalization (Leung et al., 2010) . However, KN-BSI still assumes that the tissue intensities in the baseline and repeat scans have a linear relationship. Deformation-based morphometry uses non-rigid registration to align two serial MR images. Volume change within a region of interests between the two points can be then calculated by integrating the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of the deformation field within the region of interests. Non-rigid registration may be less sensitive to contrast change due to the use of image similarity measures such as normalized cross-correlation and normalized mutual information, but it may be sensitive to the different noise characteristics of the nonaccelerated and acceleration scans. We therefore wished to investigate whether KN-BSI and deformation-based morphometry measures would be robust to changing from a non-accelerated acquisition to an accelerated MRI acquisition over a 12-month interval."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Image data and acquisition", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).\nIn the second and third phases of ADNI (ADNI-GO and ADNI-2), T1-weighted volumetric MRI scans of each individual were acquired using both non-accelerated and accelerated acquisitions in the same scanning session (IR-FSPGR on GE, and MP-RAGE on Philips and Siemens).

All statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 12.1 (College Station, Texas, US).\nResults Fig. 1 shows examples of non-accelerated and accelerated scans from each manufacturer. The non-accelerated and accelerated scans were qualitatively very similar, with some subtle differences in terms of noise characteristics.

In this post hoc analysis, we modified the intensity normalization procedure in KN-BSI. In Leung et al. (2010) , the intensity of the repeat scans was mapped to the baseline scans (and vice versa) using simple linear regression (mean CSF, GM, WM and whole brain intensities as data points). Here, we replaced it by piece-wise linear regression (mean CSF, GM and WM intensities as data points) (Ny\u00fal and Udupa, 1999) , in order to model the non-linear tissue contrast change. In the piecewise linear regression, the intensity range of the baseline and repeat scans were divided into two sections by the mean GM intensity. For the voxels with intensity lower than the mean GM intensity, the mean CSF and GM intensities were used to perform the linear regression and intensity normalization. Likewise, for the voxels with an intensity higher than the mean GM intensity, the mean GM and WM intensities were used to perform the linear regression and intensity normalization. Table 5 shows the brain atrophy rates (% baseline volume) calculated from the baseline and 12-month scans when using piece-wise linear regression (instead of simple linear regression) in the intensity normalization procedure in KN-BSI. The mean atrophy rates from the changed acquisition were 0.40% (95% CI [0.15%, 0.65%], p = 0.002) lower than the consistent acquisition in GE. Compared with Table 2 , using piece-wise linear regression can reduce the difference between the brain atrophy rate calculated using consistent and changed acquisitions in GE."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and discussion", "text": "We found that the effect on KN-BSI and fluid-based non-rigid registration when changing from the non-accelerated to accelerated MRI during follow-up depended on the scanner manufacturer. For KN-BSI, the change caused a mean reduction of 0.65% in the brain atrophy rate in GE, whereas in Philips and Siemens, the change had little impact on Table 4 Mean ( the mean atrophy rate (reduction of 0.051% in Philips and \u22120.035% in Siemens). The effect on the atrophy rate estimated by KN-BSI in GE is likely due to the difference in the GM-CSF ratio between the nonaccelerated and accelerated scans in GE (6.3% difference between the non-accelerated and accelerated scans). This is because KN-BSI assumes that the intensities of different tissues in the baseline and repeat scans have a linear relationship, and in this case, the GM-CSF ratio between the non-accelerated and accelerated scans in GE changed while the WM-GM ratio remained similar. Although WM-GM ratio changes significantly (p = 0.004) for Philips, the difference is relatively small (0.7% difference between the non-accelerated and accelerated scansan order of magnitude smaller than GE). When using piece-wise linear regression instead of simple linear regression, in the intensity normalization in KN-BSI, the difference between the mean atrophy rates between consistent and changed acquisitions in GE was reduced to 0.40% from 0.65%. For fluid-based non-rigid registration, the change caused a mean increase of 0.29% in the brain atrophy rate in the changed acquisition compared with consistent acquisition in Philips, whereas in GE and Siemens, the change had less impact on the mean atrophy rate (increase of 0.18% in GE and 0.049% in Siemens). As normalized cross-correlation was used in the fluid-based registration, it was not affected by the tissue contrast change in GE. Since the fluid-based non-rigid registration is sensitive to the level of noise in the baseline and repeat scans, the brain atrophy reduction may be caused by different noise characteristics in the nonaccelerated and accelerated scans.\nAcross different sites with the same scanner vendor, the effect on KN-BSI when changing from the non-accelerated to accelerated MRI during follow-up showed minor differences. The variability in sites with Philips scanners appears to be more consistent than with Siemens and GE.\nA change in tissue contrast between the baseline and repeat has been shown to affect BSI (Preboske et al., 2006) . Switching from a conventional SPGR to a fast SPGR sequence caused a change of 0.43% in BSI (the fast SPGR acquired a fractional echo which in turn exacerbates local susceptibility artifacts, and used a different implementation of spoiler gradients). In addition, changing the flip angle in the repeat scan from 25\u00b0to 12\u00b0and 5\u00b0caused a change of 1.85% and 30.45% in BSI (relative to the BSI using the flip angle of 25\u00b0in both baseline and repeat scans). Consistent acquisition is crucial for atrophy rate measurement using BSI and KN-BSI.\nAnother related study compared the brain atrophy rates (using a similar pipeline to KN-BSI) of consistent acquisitions with different acceleration factors and head coil types in a Siemens scanner (Krueger et al., 2012) . The brain atrophy rates of consistent accelerated acquisitions with an acceleration factor less than 5 were found to be similar. However, a systematic difference of 0.5% was observed in whole-brain BSI between consistent acquisitions using 32-and 12-channel coils, and the authors stated that it could arise from differences in repositioning and shims after the coil change during the scanning session.\nThe difference in tissue contrast between the non-accelerated and accelerated scans in GE does not appear to be caused by the reconstruction algorithm. Philips uses SENSE reconstruction (Pruessmann et al., 1999) and GE uses the closely related ASSET method, while Siemens uses GRAPPA recontruction (Griswold et al., 2002) . The difference also does not appear to relate to the looping order of the phase-encoded views, because both GE and Siemens encode ky in the outer loop and kz in the inner loop while Philips does the opposite. Similarly, as the pixel size between the accelerated and non-accelerated acquisitions is most different in Philips, the slight variation in the pixel size between the accelerated and non-accelerated acquisitions does not seem to be the source of the variation. The accelerated scans are acquired with slightly larger pixels to partially compensate for the SNR reduction associated with parallel imaging, which can be needed unless a 32-channel head coil is used (Krueger et al., 2012) . Note, however, from Table 1 that the GE pixel size change is intermediate between Siemens and Philips. Eliminating these varying factors suggests to us that the difference in acquisition technique (IR-FSPGR vs. MP-RAGE) is the primary source of the observed difference in BSI measures, although our analysis of the ADNI data in this study does not demonstrate this directly, as there are other software and hardware differences between the scanners from different vendors.\nPrevious studies have compared atrophy rates calculated from consistent non-accelerated acquisition and consistent accelerated acquisition (Ching et al., 2012, in press ). The authors estimated atrophy rates from ADNI scans using tensor-based morphometry. They found that the estimated atrophy rates from consistent non-accelerated acquisition and consistent accelerated acquisition were very similar, and that they had similar power to track brain changes. We are not aware of any previous study comparing atrophy rates calculated from the consistent and changed acquisitions.\nThe current study only investigated the effects on KN-BSI of changing from the non-accelerated to accelerated MRI in repeat scans in brain atrophy measurement. And we only used the non-accelerated and accelerated MP-RAGE/IR-SPGR scans acquired from the GE, Philips and Siemens scanners. The difference in the atrophy rate between consistent and changed acquisitions did not appear to depend on the diagnosis of the subjects, although only a small number of AD subjects in ADNI was available at the time of the study. Furthermore, similar analysis should be repeated in a different study to investigate the generality of the results and conclusions.\nA strong point of the current study is the relatively large number of subjects provided by ADNI. Also, ADNI is a multi-center study, and the accelerated and non-accelerated scans were acquired on the same scanning session for all the subjects.\nGoing from the non-accelerated baseline scans to accelerated scans for follow-up may have surprisingly little effect on computed atrophy rates depending on the exact sequence details and the scanner manufacturer, so that accidentally inconsistent scans of this nature could still be used."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "text": "The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies and non-profit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year public-private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials. The Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California San Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada. The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 subjects but ADNI has been followed by ADNI-GO and ADNI-2. To date these three protocols have recruited over 1500 adults, ages 55 to 90, to participate in the research, consisting of cognitively normal older individuals, people with early or late MCI, and people with early AD. The follow-up duration of each group is specified in the protocols for ADNI-1, ADNI-2 and ADNI-GO. The subjects originally recruited for ADNI-1 and ADNI-GO had the option to be followed in ADNI-2.
