[{"section_title": "", "text": "Tourism sector assessments are filled with definitional confusion and analytical complexity. Yet, careful investigations of the supply-side components of tourism are critical to the creation of informed public policy and integrative tourism planning. While much is known about the demand for tourism resources that lead to advertising and marketing initiatives, little is known about the inputs required to produce tourism itself. Understanding these inputs is necessary if we wish to address important issues related to the economic effects of tourism; examples include labour use, income generation and its distribution to local households, capital investment risk and land use. These inputs also provide the basis on which we can address the use and management of publicly provided amenity resources that create a primary motivating element behind tourist travel. Simply said, the foundation on which we build tourism is not well understood.\nAlthough a significant amount of literature helps in understanding the elements associated with the developmental impacts of tourism in their aggregate, tourism itself remains rather ill-defined and non-standardized. Smith argues that the limitations of secondary data representing the tourism sector makes defining tourism supply difficult (Smith, 1987 (Smith, , 1998 . Given mixed demand sources, it is argued that tourism supply necessarily must rest on a definition of the tourism sector that specifies the extent of tourism reliance. Although criticized as an oversimplification of the complex and partially industrialized structure of tourism supply, Smith's perspective emphasizes the measurement of scale, performance and economic impacts for locality-specific firms catering to travellers and visitors (cf Leiper, 1990; Eadington and Redman, 1991; Gibson, 1993; Ioannides and Debbage, 1998) .\nA key element in community support of tourism development is its ability to create jobs. Many argue that policymakers base decisions on tourism promotion and development from a job creation standpoint without sufficient information on the actual employment performance of tourism industries (Hudson and Townsend, 1993; Leiper, 1999; Hall, 2000) . Analysis of tourism employment needs to account for more than simply numbers of jobs. The types of jobs created from the standpoint of wage rates, permanence, career opportunities and skill levels employed are important. Indeed, many have identified that jobs in tourism tend to be relatively low wage, seasonal and parttime (Stynes and Pigozzi, 1983; Blank, 1989; Luloff et al, 1994) and often act against the regional developmental objective of high-wage job creation (Pond, 1988; Bernhardt et al, 2003a) .\nJob opportunities are argued to be an important supplemental income component for retired people and others who are experiencing work transitions. Further, for certain types of tourism jobs, lucrative career ladders exist. Examples include professional entertainers and athletes, hotel and gaming managers, tourism establishment engineers and highly skilled personal service occupations such as chefs and directors of sport facilities (ski directors and golf pros). Also, meeting planners, tourism marketing professionals and public sector jobs are key steps on career ladders that can build from entry-level positions in tourism.\nTourism businesses tend to provide incentives for entrepreneurial behaviour of individuals. Ladkin (1999) , in work-life research, finds that many people enter tourism jobs from other industries and that tourism skill sets tend to have background impacts favouring entry-level positions while still making it possible for motivated individuals to work up through ranks, thus attaining more managerial and professional positions. Szivas et al (2003) , in similar focused research, found that patterns of mobility, orientation to work and selfevaluation are hallmarks of successful tourism workers. In particular, accelerated opportunity for advancement and incentives for entrepreneurialism lead to general satisfaction of those who remain successfully employed by tourism businesses. Their results suggest that tourism employment as a 'way of life' supports the notion that people are prepared to surrender education-occupation compatibility in return for a more self-controlled work-life relationship.\nThe wide variety of employment types in travel and tourism businesses has regional development dimensions from the perspective of generating a widely varying set of income streams. The issue of income distribution is complex and empirical work has not yet generated sufficiently robust results to inform generalized theoretical approaches. A limited number of studies have evaluated the distributional effects of alternative sectors including tourism (Wagner, 1997; Lee and Kang, 1998; Marcouiller, 1996, 1999) showing mixed results, while clearly identifying critical developmental linkages. Results of work by Lee and Kang (1998) suggest that tourism generates a moderately equal distribution of earnings, comparable to other secondary and tertiary industries, but it performs poorly as compared with primary industries such as agriculture, forestry and mining. The Lee and Kang results also suggest that tourism is primarily a low-wage industry and thus more likely to improve living standards for those who find themselves in the lower income classes as compared to secondary and tertiary sectors.\nAgain, more research into income distribution is needed to provide useful input into public policy responses. There are interesting connections between income distribution and other elements important to tourism. For instance, in recent work by Fern\u00e1ndez-Morales (2003) , seasonality was shown to be an important element in explaining the distribution of income. The results of this research suggest that during peak tourism seasons, income inequality decreased, with the most pronounced period of high income inequality occurring during the 'off-season'. This makes intuitive sense but highlights the need for further research prior to sounding distributional alarms. Also, in research from the US Lake States (Marcouiller et al, 2004) , latent amenity inputs (such as water resources) are shown to be significant explanatory factors in understanding the distribution of income, leading to several implications, one dealing with quality-of-life trade-offs.\nWithout thorough analysis and based on ad hoc conventional wisdom, the availability of employment opportunities resulting from tourism demands is often seen either as beneficial and appropriate to local labour markets or acting against community-determined economic development goals. An underlying tension exists within the conventional wisdom related to tourism which can be characterized by extremes that reflect two ill-conceived positions. On the one hand, proponents of tourism argue that broad-based employment benefits are substantial and clearly justify large marketing subsidies to increase the incidence of tourist travel. On the other, opponents of tourism argue that the jobs created by tourism firms tend to be low wage, seasonal and lacking substantial benefits; thus, public resources targeting the creation of jobs are best placed with industrial sectors characterized by higher wage/benefit and year-round employment opportunities. Both arguments rest on a dearth of objective labour market assessments for tourism.\nThe research reported here addresses several key thematic and methodological questions involved in an assessment of labour use by tourism/travel-related firms and its resulting return in terms of income. From a thematic perspective, to what extent is wage and salary income generated within tourism-sensitive sectors? Once generated, how is this income distributed among employees. Spatially, an extended question deals with differences in the distribution of income between urban, suburban and exurban (or rural) regions. From a methodological perspective, the work reported here answers additional questions. How are the distributions of wage and salary income from tourism standardized for empirical analysis? How can we conduct regional analysis which distinguishes distributional variations that exist along the urban-rural continuum.\nThis article is organized into four subsequent sections. First, we outline the necessary components of the research approach by briefly describing the methods used to collect and summarize the data. Second, we empirically estimate county-level income distributions for tourism sectors in the US Lake State of Wisconsin, the results of which are described and discussed. We conclude with a section that summarizes the effort and provides a starting point for key public policy implications that can be inferred from the work."}, {"section_title": "Methods used to address objectives", "text": "Our approach involved the collection and analysis of quantitative data from secondary data sources on labour employed, income derived and occupational structure within constituent industrial sectors. Empirically, we focus on estimating sector-specific income distributions at the county level in the US Lake State of Wisconsin. While economically and demographically representative of the Upper Midwestern portion of the USA, this region provides a relatively heterogeneous natural, cultural and built amenity base on which tourism is supplied. Further, the State of Wisconsin is comprised of counties that represent a robust representation of the urban-rural spectrum, which provides an important set of interregional distinctions that, in part, motivated this research.\nThe definition of what makes up tourism remains rather nebulous and evades simple characterization. For this work, the approach relies on a specified sectoral range that represents the tourism industry. Quite specifically, it represents more closely those sectors that are, in part or in total, reliant on tourists as a demand source. It is necessarily based on a supply side or industry perspective that allows clear delineation of sectors on which secondary data can be collected. This sectoral range is specified in Table 1 .\nFor the purpose of this study, the travel and tourism industry was limited to the private economic sectors that are directly reliant on travel-based tourism for all or part of their annual demand. This definition does not take into account other economic sectors that benefit indirectly from traveller expenditures. These include, but are not limited to, construction, real estate, marketing, law, accounting and other professional service occupations. A variety of data sets were used to compile base data and disaggregate control totals into an occupational structure. National, state and county level industrial Secondary data were compiled, cleaned and summarized for use in several distributions. From QCEW data, the quarterly reported establishments and employees were averaged to obtain an annual mean for those categories. This was completed for each industry at the county level. Reported wages were aggregated from quarters to an annual total. The average annual wage was calculated by dividing the wage total by the average number of employees. In counties with lower levels of economic activity, QCEW data were often suppressed for certain sectors. Because statewide totals were known, remaining wages, employees and firms to non-reporting counties were distributed on the basis of county population. This was done in several steps. In each county with disclosure problems, the total of wage/salary income and employment from counties without disclosure problems (EC r ) was subtracted from the reported statewide total (EC WI ) to derive the unreported portion (EC d ), as shown in Equation (1).\nThis total amount of undistributed income or employment was then allocated to the counties with disclosure problems based on population (divided by a coefficient related to the population of each county as a proportion of all those experiencing suppression problems). After all wage and salary income and employment were distributed to the suppressed counties, industry totals were derived for the state and each county. Totals and percentages were then calculated on the basis of the three regions identified by Beale codes (shown in Figure 1 and further explained below).\nOccupational data by SOC is only cross-referenced with NAICS industrial sectors at the national level. The distributional coefficients relating wage/salary income and employment in each occupational category were applied to the state and county totals for each industry obtained from the NAICS analysis. This gave an estimate of workers and wage/salary income in each occupation within each specified industry at the county level. The occupational structure for each sector at the county level was then aggregated up to provide totals for each respective region.\nThe following distributional equation was used in developing occupational structure:\nwhere occupations structure (OS) for occupational class i is simply a proportion, \u03b1, for each class multiplied by the total characteristic, EC (either employment or income) for each region, r. Given availability of data, calculation of \u03b1 for each industrial sector was done at the national level. Spatially, there were interesting differences among various sub-state regions across the state. The data are presented by relevant region in Wisconsin. For summary purposes, regional data were disaggregated based on a county's degree and intensity of urban development (its place along the rural to urban continuum). This has been operationalized by the USDA Economic Research Service using what are known as Beale Codes, which place a county along the rural to urban continuum using key, spatially defined demographic elements, such as population and adjacency to a metropolitan area (USDA, 2006) . The 2003 Beale Codes (sometimes also referred to as 'Rural-urban Continuum Codes') form a classification scheme that distinguishes metropolitan counties by size and non-metropolitan counties by degree of urbanization and proximity to metropolitan areas. The standard Office of Management and Budget (OMB) metropolitan and non-metropolitan categories have been subdivided into three metropolitan and six non-metropolitan categories, resulting in a nine-part county codification. The specific elements that define respective Beale Codes include the following:\nMetropolitan counties:\n1 Counties in metro areas of 1 million population or more 2 Counties in metro areas of 250,000 to 1 million population 3 Counties in metro areas of fewer than 250,000 population Non-metropolitan counties:\n4 Urban population of 20,000 or more, adjacent to a metro area 5 Urban population of 20,000 or more, not adjacent to a metro area 6 Urban population of 2,500 to 19,999, adjacent to a metro area 7 Urban population of 2,500 to 19,999, not adjacent to a metro area 8 Completely rural or less than 2,500 urban population, adjacent to a metro area 9 Completely rural or less than 2,500 urban population, not adjacent to a metro area\nTo simplify and summarize, Beale Codes were combined into three distinct categories that can be defined as Urban and Suburban (Codes 1, 2, 3), Exurban or Suburban Proximate (Codes 4, 5, 6) and Rural Remote (Codes 7, 8, 9) . For Wisconsin counties, these groupings are shown in Figure 1 . It is recognized that the labels used differ from the standard descriptions and are somewhat ad hoc. As noted in Figure 1 , the urban and suburban portion of Wisconsin includes the south-eastern counties along Lake Michigan from Kenosha, A standardized summary metric for income distribution is represented by the Gini coefficient. This metric represents the relationship between the cumulative percentage of total income within an economic grouping and the cumulative percentage of income received by individuals ranked by income. The analogous graphical representation is a Lorenz curve, with the Gini representing the proportional difference between income equality and the measured distribution of income.\nThe Gini coefficient yields a scalar from 0, indicating perfect equality, to 1, indicating the most extreme inequality. The larger the Gini coefficient, the higher the income inequality. For this paper, we adapted work by Kuenne (1993) that employed Equation (3) to obtain the Gini coefficient of the grouped wage and salary income at the county level from the above listed data sources: where n is the number of income categories, \u00b5 is the mean of income categories, x i is total income in income category i (= j) and y i is the income share of income category i.\nSince Gini coefficients are calculated to represent the continuous functional Lorenz curve, using secondary data sets built using discrete categorical data presents empirical complexities and gross estimations. Various methods exist to calculate the Gini coefficient. Because Keunne's empirical specification involves the income share, rather than a cumulative proportion, we chose to adapt this formula slightly, following an approach by Ye (2003) . While the two formulations generate identical results, our data lend themselves to the following formula for calculating the Gini coefficient (derivation found in Appendix A):"}, {"section_title": "Rural remote", "text": "Rural, suburban proximate\nUrban and suburban\nwhere n -1 is the number of income categories, X i is the cumulative employment proportions and Y i is the cumulative proportions of income with i = 1,2,...n, with n determined by the respective distributions; X 1 = 0%, X n = 100%;"}, {"section_title": "Descriptive results", "text": "In the aggregate, industries used to define travel and tourism in Wisconsin comprised an important set of firms that spanned retail, transportation and personal service sectors. It is important to note that the scope of this research focused on a supply-side characterization of the travel and tourism industry and did not distinguish the important demand elements of each sector necessary for a strict tourism-and/or travel-based definition; that is, the amount of out-ofregion demand (the tourism component) for each sector may vary from low (clothing retailers) to high (accommodation). Earlier work specific to Wisconsin counties provided estimates of this regional demand attribute (Leatherman and Marcouiller, 1996) . A demand-based disaggregation remains beyond the scope of the work reported here. Taken in their entirety, the estimates of employment and income presented in this report provide an overestimate of the effect that travel and tourism demands present due to the mixture of local and non-local demands. Because of this supply-side characteristic, the results presented are not directly comparable to estimates that are based on traveller expenditures or demand-driven tourism activity. For the purposes of organization, the presentation of results will begin with the aggregate characteristics of wage and salary employment by the ten sectors defined to encompass travel and tourism in Wisconsin. Reporting of disaggregate data for wage and salary income will then be presented spatially (across three distinct regional delineations) and then by occupational category. We follow this with the results on income distribution through displays of the respective Gini coefficient calculations."}, {"section_title": "Aggregate labour characteristics", "text": "Aggregate characteristics of wage and salary labour use in travel and tourism sectors suggest interesting aspects that have both sectoral and spatial components. The context of aggregate wage and salary characteristics by sector for the state as a whole is summarized in Table 2 .\nIn total, the ten sectors used in defining the travel and tourism industry accounted for almost 22,000 individual firms, who employed slightly more than 317,000 people, paying them a total of about US$4 billion in wage and salary income during 2002. In looking across the ten sectors used to define travel and tourism, clearly the largest individual sector was Food Services and Drinking Places, with a total amount of wages paid of roughly 40% of the earnings, or about US$1.7 billion in 2002. This was followed by Amusements, Gambling and Recreation and Accommodation. The spatial distribution of labour and income\nWhile the Wisconsin landscape can be characterized easily as fairly rural, there are several metropolitan and 'micropolitan' areas that are unique from both demographic and economic perspectives. These urban areas tend to dominate industrial activity, including that which occurs within the travel and tourism sectors. The urban and suburban counties of Wisconsin are where the majority of people live and, consequently, comprise the location of the majority of economic activity. The distribution of travel and tourism industry activity varies widely across the state and is presented graphically in Tables 3 (wage and salary income) and 4 (employment). From these tables, it is important to note that travel and tourism industry earnings were highly concentrated in the 25 urban and suburban counties. These counties accounted for over three-quarters of all wage and salary income and roughly 72% of all travel and tourism sector jobs. This is explained by the agglomeration effects of metropolitan areas and the manner in which travel and tourism sectors are defined, which incorporate business and other non-leisure travel. On the other end of the scale, the 21 counties that comprise remote, rural Wisconsin contained only 6% of the wage and salary income and slightly less than 7% of the travel and tourism sector jobs. This said, there was wide variation among sectors in the location of travel and tourism activity. For instance, almost 95% of the Air Transportation income and employment occurred in urban and suburban Wisconsin. This is to be expected, due to the location of major airports. On the other hand, the Accommodation sector, which is a key travel and tourism sector, was much more dispersed across the state, with only about 62% of income and 58% of jobs occurring in urban and suburban Wisconsin. This same dispersed pattern was also evident in the Gasoline Stations sector and, to a lesser degree, in the Amusement, Gambling and Recreation sector.\nThe largest rural remote shares of travel and tourism industry activity occurred in the Accommodation and Gasoline Stations sectors. Distribution of tourism income Figure 1) . 2 Exurban, suburban proximate counties include those non-metropolitan counties that are either proximate to metropolitan counties or contain small urban cities. In Wisconsin, there are a total of 26 counties in this category (see Figure 1 )."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "Rural, remote counties are those counties that are completely rural or rural and not directly adjacent to a metropolitan county.\nIn Wisconsin, there are a total of 21 counties in this category (see Figure 1) .

In Wisconsin, there are a total of 26 counties in this category (see Figure 1) ."}, {"section_title": "The distribution of tourism labour income", "text": "Of the occupational categories employed in the travel and tourism industry, the single dominant job type that warrants more focused study appears to be the Food Preparation and Serving Related occupational group. As shown in Figure  2 , it accounts for a total of 58% of the jobs and 43% of the wage and salary income. Throughout each travel and tourism sector, it appeared as an important employment category and tended to have relatively lower levels of annual wage and salary income. This can be explained largely by the type of jobs covered in this category and their respective skill and responsibility levels.\nCertainly, this low rate of pay could also be due to several additional factors beyond the control of our study, including the prevalence of part-time and seasonal work. In addition, while the reporting of tip income is mandatory, there is likely some amount of under-reporting, which helps explain this relatively low level of annual income.\nThese general characteristics of occupational structure by tourism subsector and corresponding income distribution are further disaggregated by spatial location in Table 5 . Note two clear elements of interest from this table. First, there is a distinct difference in income distribution by tourism subsector. Second, there is a distinct spatial element associated with income distribution resulting from tourism employment.\nWith regard to the first element, note from Table 5 that the highest levels of income inequality among sectors is found in the Performing Arts and Spectator Sports (NAICS 711) and Museums, Parks and Historical Sites (NAICS 712) sectors. These sectors, intuitively, exhibit the widest amount of variation in incomes with the presence of a small number of highly paid employees and a relatively large number of lower paid employees. Interestingly, sector 712, labelled Amusement, Gambling and Recreation (another sector within the Arts, Entertainment and Recreation NAICS grouping 71), does not exhibit these distributional characteristics and exists as a more low-skill/low-wage sector across occupational categories. Likewise, the sectors that exhibit the lowest amount of income inequality are the Food Services and Drinking Places (NAICS 722) and retail merchandising (NAICS 447, 448, 453) . In essence, little income inequality results from a generally common and persistent problem of low wages experienced across all occupational categories. Interestingly, the Accommodation sector (NAICS 721) exhibits generally higher levels of inequality when compared to these sectoral groupings.\nSpatially, an interesting result of this work suggests that urban tourism exhibits generally higher levels of income inequality when compared to rural remote or exurban, suburban proximate tourism. This result, most probably, is created by generally higher levels of competition for higher skilled labour in urban areas, which leads to upward pressure on wage rates. While one would expect this upward pressure on wage rates to be found across occupational categories, our results suggest otherwise. Increased labour competitiveness in urban areas appears to be disproportionately higher in the occupations characterized by higher wages (for example, management, business/financial operations, etc). While the need exists for these occupations in rural remote regions, the generally less diverse economic structure and less competitive labour environment translates into generally lower and more equal wage structures among occupations. "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Several aspects of the preceding analysis warrant further discussion. When we look at the spatial distribution of labour use in tourism, it is important to keep in mind the simple fact that there are wide variations in economic structure, wage rates and cost of living between urban and rural regions. For illustrative purposes, wage and salary income from travel and tourism sectors could be arrayed against the comparable average annual wage and salary income for all sectors by county. These regional differences in wage structure are outlined for Wisconsin counties in Figure 3 . It is interesting to note a couple of simple observations. First, in all counties, the aggregate travel and tourism sector earnings (wage and salary) were lower than the average for all sectors. Second, there was a general pattern to the income disparity across the state; that is, rural regions had lower income differentials when compared to urban and"}, {"section_title": "Difference (US$)", "text": "suburban counties. This is despite the fact that, with rare exception, the travel and tourism sectors generated absolute wage and salary income at disproportionately higher pay rates in urban and suburban counties.\nWhen we compare the travel and tourism sectors to all other incomegenerating activity throughout Wisconsin, it is apparent that these firms provide important job opportunities to low-income households and provide employment opportunities to those who are entry-level workers, lack higher skill levels, are seeking supplemental income, or are retired or working for other non-monetary reasons. It is also evident from the data that there are significant career ladder opportunities available to those who are committed to the business. Examples of these career ladder opportunities include management, financial operations, professional skilled performers and other technical occupations."}, {"section_title": "Summary, policy implications and further research needs", "text": "In this paper, we described the process and results of a study that examined the structure of employment in travel and tourism sectors. Empirically, we used Wisconsin county-level data and regional distributions to address the key objectives of quantifying annual wage/salary employment by source using various income and labour force metrics that included wage and salary compensation and total number of jobs. This was done for ten supply-side subsectors that were sensitive to tourism receipts. Once compiled, occupational structure was used to distinguish wage/salary employment by the types of jobs employed by each sector and their respective compensation rates. This countylevel data set was then aggregated up into three sub-state regions (based on a county's position along the rural to urban continuum) for the purposes of summarizing spatial elements representing travel and tourism labour markets. For these regions, Gini coefficients were calculated and interpreted for conclusions focused on the distribution of earnings by sector.\nResults suggest that the travel and tourism industry is comprised of several sectors that are, more or less, dependent on travellers for a portion of their total receipts. These sectors in Wisconsin employed over 300,000 people in 2002 and generated roughly US$4 billion in wage and salary income. Occupational structure of the wage and salary employment was concentrated in the Food Preparation and Serving and Sales occupations. Indeed, these two categories accounted for roughly 74% of the jobs and 60% of the wage and salary income of the total employment picture in the ten sectors used to define travel and tourism. Wage and salary income was concentrated in the 25 urban and suburban counties of Wisconsin.\nThe Gini coefficient results suggested that income inequality was evident in sectors that had distributions including high-wage employment, like the Performing Arts and Sports. Conversely, Food Service and Drinking Places tended to have generally more equal distributions of earnings, which were characterized by lower average annual rates of pay.\nSpatially, Gini coefficient results also suggest that urban tourism tends to be characterized by generally higher levels of income inequality when compared to rural tourism. We speculate that the causal elements of this surround the notion that urban structures tend to have higher levels of labour competition and that this competition drives higher wage rates among higher skilled occupations.\nThe assessment of labour use in the travel and tourism sectors was limited to 2001 and 2002. Certainly, an important avenue for further research could pursue the development of historical time-series data sets that could be used to assess change in occupational structure over time. This would allow a more complete assessment of key trends and explanatory elements used in forecasting future labour market characteristics.\nLabour use in travel and tourism sectors was limited by definitions that provided a match with supply-side data sets on economic activity. For our purposes, travel and tourism was defined in a rather ad hoc manner by specifying all activity in ten 'reliant' sectors, including specific 3-digit NAICS sectors representing transportation, retail and personal services. Certainly, alternative definitions could be used that more clearly specify private, quasi-public and public sector jobs that are directly and indirectly related to producing tourism output. This provides a rather substantial set of future research needs that characterizes more clearly how tourism is produced and builds on previous work by Smith (1987 Smith ( , 1998 , Leatherman and Marcouiller (1996) , Ioaniddes and Debbage (1998), Marcouiller (1998) , Leiper (1999) and Hall (2000) .\nFurthermore, this work was limited to annualized estimates of income and jobs for the travel and tourism sectors; many of which are characterized by a relatively high incidence of part-time and seasonal jobs. Interestingly, when looking at the annualized estimates (based on hourly wage rates) by occupation and factor in the types of occupations that dominate the ten sectors and regional considerations, the values reported for annual wage and salary income are generally consistent with the estimates based on hourly rates. Certainly, an important avenue for further research could specify more clearly the extent of seasonality and part-time characteristics and build on previous research by Stynes and Pigozzi (1983) , Krakover (2000) and Fern\u00e1ndez-Morales (2003) .\nRegional analysis is also a key element of this research. This assessment was limited to county-based estimates while, for many regions, the county boundary is a fairly arbitrary geographic delineation. Further work could provide assessments at alternative geographic scales that include subcounty delineations. On a more macro scale, the three-region specification scheme allowed summarization of a large data set using generally reasonable rural to urban continuum groupings. This urban to rural context is important for several dimensions of tourism planning. For instance, differentiating seasonality by region is important. Krakover (2000) points out that the impact of seasonality on tourism operators is significant and that urban areas with large workforces are better matched to fluctuating demands than are rural areas. The development context of remote rural counties is unique and provides stark contrast to the more diverse economies found in urban and suburban Wisconsin.\nOccupational structure and the distribution of income provide ample opportunities for further discussion. Results confirm much of the descriptive results of Lee and Kang (1998) ; that is, that travel and tourism sectors are an important generator of employment for entry-level people, those in transition and/or those seeking supplemental income sources. Generally considered a 'low-wage industry', travel and tourism is more likely to help in improving living standards for those who find themselves with limited skill sets or seeking work for quality-of-life and other non-monetary reasons. Further work is needed to confirm the hypothesis of tourism's distributional 'hollowing-out' effect. Certainly, additional work will continue to develop useful empirical, policyrelevant investigations that view tourism and travel as one of several critical sectors to future community economic development throughout the Lake States. This work also provides a rather substantive future research need and can build on the previous work of Wagner (1997) , Lee and Kang (1998) , Leatherman and Marcouiller (1999) and Marcouiller et al (2004) .\nOur contextual understanding of travel and tourism in Wisconsin was limited to information gathered from tourism business owners and operators. While valuable to understand labour market issues facing employers, it lacks a certain element of labour market issues from the perspective of the employee. Future work could capture more fully the various elements of occupational structure and build on employee-focused research specific to the travel and tourism industry. For instance, work-history research by Ladkin (1999) argues that the information from detailed work-history analysis has particular relevance for the hospitality and tourism industry. Despite a well-established use of life and work-history data as a research method in the social sciences, as yet it has received little application to hospitality and tourism research and remains an important future research need.\nContemporary policy discussions surrounding travel and tourism are wide ranging. In addition to public budgetary subsidies for promotion, specific issues of public policy surround labour availability during the peak tourism season through the implementation of a school start policy after Labor Day, minimum wage laws, availability and legality of migrant labour and training in hospitality sector skills, to name just a few. Work by Belau (1999) at an international level and by Bernhardt et al (2003a,b) attempts to frame policy discussion around an ability to affect high quality labour in tourism and develop 'normative' inferences. Inferences from this work are limited to the 'positive' attributes, or characteristics of labour use in travel and tourism sectors.\nFinally, there is a continual need for further research into communityoriented and integrative tourism planning; this takes on both thematic and process elements. Incorporating wider stakeholder involvement in the planning process, while developing a more complete understanding of the implications of the effects of tourism on local communities inevitably will lead to development that addresses key people-oriented needs found at the forefront of regional planning efforts.\nThe process of calculating the Gini coefficient as summarized by Ye (2003) involves estimating the area found underneath the Lorenz curve and comparing this to the total area found under a line of income equality. In empirical estimation of the continuous Lorenz function, the following outlines a successive method of estimating triangular approximations to the continuous function. S 1 represents the area under the income equality line bounded above the Lorenz curve. S 2 represents the area under the Lorenz curve. Thus, the empirically calculated Gini coefficient is derived as follows: "}]
