The share of all doctorates in economics that are earned by U.S. citizens maintained its decline of a bit more than a percentage point per year over the past quarter century, falling to 38 percent by 2001. As a result, there were only about 350 new economics Ph.D.s awarded to U.S. citizens in 2001, down from 430 in 1996, and now at approximately the annual level awarded during Lyndon Johnson's administration. Individual universities continue to bear most responsibility for financing graduate economics education, although federal aid recovered modestly in the last five years. When undergraduate economics enrollments fell in the first half of the 1990s, some graduate teaching assistantships evaporated. As undergraduate enrollments have recovered since the 1996 trough (Siegfried, 2003), teaching assistantships for doctoral students have rebounded as well. The proportion of graduates with postdoctoral employment plans remained steady from 1996 through 2001. Despite continued growth in the proportion of Ph.D. graduates who are not U.S. citizens, the fraction of graduates accepting jobs outside the U.S. declined from 1996 to 2001, perhaps because U.S. employers offered sufficiently high salaries to avoid being rationed out of the tightening market. Adjusting the number of Ph.D. degrees awarded by the proportion who take jobs in the United States indicates that the number of new economics doctorates hired annually by U.S. employers has remained close to 700 over the past quarter century."}, {"section_title": "II. The 2002-03 Survey", "text": "Our primary source of information for this study comes from a survey of individuals who earned a Ph.D. in economics between July 1, 2001 andJune 30, 2002. We also obtained from thesis advisors partial information for some of the graduates who did not return the questionnaire. We identify our population from the December 2002 Journal of Economic Literature (JEL), which lists 911 dissertation titles of graduates from 111 U.S. and 12 Canadian Ph.D. programs. Starting with these 911 dissertation titles, subtracting the 47 graduates of Canadian universities and the 52 U.S. degrees we know were awarded by departments other than \"standard\" economics departments, leaves 812 U.S. economics Ph.D.s awarded in 2001-02. Based on survey responses, we know that at least 84 of these 812 did not earn their degree in the specified time window. If we conservatively assume that the number reported in earlier or later years that, in fact, did earn their degree between July 1, 2001 and June 30, 2002 is roughly equal to the 84 \"out of period\" graduates who were listed in the December 2002 JEL, and if we allow for several dozen dissertations that might go unreported each year, we judge that about 850 Ph.D.s were awarded in economics by U.S. universities in 2001-02, down 100 from our comparably estimated 950 in 1996-97. NSF's count declined by 127 from 1997 to 2002. NSF reports 903 economics Ph.D.s for 2001-02. 2 We received 398 useable graduate responses. 3 Including 121 responses from thesis advisors of graduates who did not return the survey themselves, we have at least partial information for 519 of the roughly 850 economics Ph.D.s we estimate were earned in the U.S. in 2001-02. This 61 percent response rate is substantially higher than most previous efforts (Siegfried and Stock, 1999). Our respondents obtained their degrees from 99 different U.S. universities. Including the graduates for whom we secured partial information from thesis advisors, the number of institutions represented grows to 101. There are 10 or more graduates in the combined samples from each of 15 different universities, including 25 from Harvard, 20 from California-Berkeley, 19 from MIT, 18 from Chicago, and 16 from NYU. No other institution has more than 15 graduates in the sample."}, {"section_title": "III. The Sample and Its Representativeness", "text": "Summary statistics for responses from the 2001-02 graduates themselves and reports from the thesis advisors of nonrespondents are shown in Table 2. By assuming there is no response bias from the advisor survey correlated with graduates' characteristics, we can project the characteristics identified in Table 2 to the entire estimated population of 850 U.S. economics doctorates in 2001-02, as reported in column 3. Various sources, including the direct responses to our survey, the Survey of Earned Doctorates, the responses of 79 Ph.D. granting programs to the American Economic Association's (AEA) Universal Academic Questionnaire (UAQ) (Scott and Siegfried, 2003), and data collected by the AEA's Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession (CSWEP) (Joan Haworth, 2003), confirm that the share of new Ph.D.s in economics awarded to women has grown to about 28 percent in 2001-02, up from 25 percent five years earlier. CSWEP reports that for the period 1995-97, the years during which 70 percent of our sample entered graduate school, roughly 31 percent of first-year Ph.D. students were female (Haworth, 2003). The difference between the proportion of new economics Ph.D.s that are female and the lagged number of first-year economics Ph.D. students that are female suggests a slightly higher attrition rate among female than male graduate students. Because the proportion of new economics Ph.D. students who are female averaged over one-third between 1997one-third between -98 and 2002one-third between -03 (Haworth, 2003Scott and Siegfried, 2003), the percentage of new Ph.D.s in economics earned by women is likely to rise modestly over the next few years. As was true of the class of 1996-97, respondents are considerably more likely than nonrespondents to be U.S. citizens. Our projection that only 37 percent of U.S. economics doctorates were awarded to U.S. citizens is consistent with the NSF's documented long steady decline in this fraction. Moreover, as part of a larger project we recently surveyed 27 U.S. economics Ph.D. programs (including 15 of the 20 largest) regarding the characteristics of their first-year Ph.D. students in Fall 2002. U.S. citizens comprise 33 percent of the students in that group. If retention rates for domestic students are less than for foreign students, as seems plausible, the proportion of Ph.D. degrees awarded to U.S. citizens is likely to be in the 31-32 percent range by 2008. In addition, the number of U.S. citizen first-year Ph.D. students at these 27 programs declined an amazing 10 percent from Fall 2002 to Fall 2003, which is particularly surprising in view of the recently bleak domestic job market prospects for U.S. baccalaureate degree holders. Thus, it appears that the downward trend in the percent of U.S. economics Ph.D.s awarded to U.S. citizens will continue unabated for at least five more years, having already plummeted 40 percentage points over the last 40 years. We find that 76 percent of new U.S. economics Ph.D.s earned bachelor's degrees in economics (including double-majors). 4 Contrary to common perception, only 14 graduates (4.1 percent) earned bachelor's degrees in mathematics; five percent held bachelor's degrees in engineering. No other undergraduate major accounts for more than four percent of the sample. As was the case in 1996-97, roughly 45 percent of the 2001-02 graduates held a master's degree prior to entering their Ph.D. program. The vast majority of these (76 percent) were in economics; five percent were in public policy. Over 97 percent of the employed graduates of the class of 2001-02 obtained full-time jobs. The advisor responses indicate that nonrespondents are more likely than respondents to hold permanent jobs. Our projection suggests that 59 percent of the 2001-02 cohort secured jobs in academe. Respondents were more likely than nonrespondents to have specialized in economic development and health, education, and welfare economics and were less likely to have specialized in macro/monetary economics. As was the case with the class of 1996-97, the largest percentages of economics Ph.D.s specialize in macro/monetary economics and international economics."}, {"section_title": "IV. Time-to-degree", "text": "Based on information from graduates and thesis advisors, we project the median time-todegree for the class of 2001-02 as 5.4 years. The range extended from 2.7 to an extraordinary 29.7 years. Only 65 graduates completed their degrees within four years. Time-to-degree can be partitioned into a median of 1.0 year to complete first-year or core preliminary examinations, an additional 1.8 years to complete all other non-dissertation requirements, and a further 2.6 years to complete the dissertation. To examine variations in time-to-degree, we estimated a duration model based on a Weibull distribution for the 348 graduates who answered all the questions we included. 5 The 16 graduates whose time-to-degree was more than two standard deviations from the mean were excluded. 6 The variables we expected to affect time-to-degree include: particular graduate programs (i.e., dummies for universities with at least seven graduates in the regression sample), type of financial support, type of dissertation, field of specialization, and socio-demographic and educational background characteristics. We report estimated coefficients of the variables that were statistically significantly different from zero at the ten percent significance level (two-tail tests). The mean time-to-degree for the regression sample is 5.7 years. There are at least seven graduates in the regression sample from 13 different universities: California-Berkeley, Chicago, Columbia, Cornell, George Mason, Harvard, Maryland, Minnesota, MIT, NYU, Stanford, Wisconsin, and UCLA and we included binary indicators for these programs in the regression. Among these 13, relative to all of the others as a benchmark, Ph.D. students at Chicago, Cornell, Harvard, MIT, and NYU graduated significantly faster. Cornell students win the quick-like-a-bunny award, finishing an estimated 15 months faster at the mean. No school qualifies for the slow-like-a-tortoise award, however, as none was significantly longer than the benchmark. Fifty-six percent of the graduates wrote a dissertation consisting of a set of essays rather than a single-topic treatise. Holding other things constant, choosing to write a set of essays is estimated to save about 6.5 months in the doctoral production process. The growing popularity of a set of essays as a dissertation clearly has more motivation behind it than simply preparing research for submission to professional journals. We asked graduates to identify each source of financial aid they received (e.g., teaching assistantship, research assistantship, no-work fellowship, and government sponsorship) for each of the first five years in their Ph.D. program. We then classified them as having received predominately one type of financial aid if that type was their sole source of aid for a majority of their first five years in graduate school. Forty-four percent of graduates in our regression sample received a mixed financial aid package. Thirty-one percent received predominantly teaching assistantships, 9 percent received predominately research assistantships, 8 percent predominately fellowships, and 4 percent predominately government support. Only 4 percent of graduates received no financial aid. In the duration model, there is no difference in time-to-degree for those whose graduate study was financed either predominately by a research assistantship or predominately by a no-work fellowship and the benchmark of those receiving predominately teaching assistantships. Those with government sponsorship (e.g., U.S. military officers and graduates supported by foreign governments) are predicted to finish 10.6 months faster at the mean than those financing their study predominately through teaching assistantships. Receiving a mixed support package was estimated to save four months, while receiving no support was estimated to extend the time-to-degree by finished eight months relative to those predominately on teaching assistantships. No field of study is associated with a significantly different time-to-degree than micro theory (the benchmark). After controlling for other factors, those holding a master's degree were predicted to take about three months less than those without one. Amazingly, no difference in predicted timeto-degree exists between those who held a prior degree in economics when they began their Ph.D. studies and those that started economics doctoral study without this background. Sex, marital status, children, age, and race are also unrelated to time-to-degree. Even when we estimate the effect of children on time-to-degree separately for men and women there is no significant difference in timeto-degree based on children. U.S. citizens were predicted to take about seven months longer to complete their degrees than non-citizens."}, {"section_title": "V. Employment Outcomes", "text": "We asked graduates (and their advisors) about their employment status as of the first week of December 2002. The unemployment rate among recent economics Ph.D.s continues to be low, projected as 2.1 percent for the population of graduates, slightly under the 2.9 percent we reported five years earlier for the class of 1996-97. It is somewhat lower than the 2.7 percent national unemployment rate during the same time period for 25-34 year olds with four or more years of college (source: authors' calculations based on the Current Population Survey). Less than one percent of the sample (only 4 of 508 individuals) were neither working nor looking for work (and thus not in the labor force). Based on our graduate and advisor responses [and not projecting outcomes for the full population], 97 percent of those employed from the class of 2001-02 held full-time positions; 82 percent held permanent jobs. Eighty-one percent of the employed held full-time permanent positions; 16 percent were in full-time temporary positions. A third of the 88 graduates in temporary positions held post-doctoral appointments. At just six percent of the full-time appointments, postdocs are less prevalent in economics than in the natural sciences (Siegfried and Stock, 1999) Graduates' perceptions of job satisfaction differ based on the percentage of time they spend in these various activities. In response to the question \"How do you feel about your job?\" 55 percent said they like it very much, 39 percent said they like it fairly well, and 6 percent said they dislike it or dislike it somewhat. Those 6 percent who stated that they dislike their jobs at least somewhat spend an average of 44 percent of their time teaching and 30 percent in research. Those who stated that they like their job very much spend an average of 25 percent of their time teaching and 50 percent of their time in research. The 37 percent of employed graduates who strongly agreed with the statement \"This position is similar to what I expected to be doing when I began my Ph.D. program\" spend an average of 31 percent of their time teaching and 51 percent of their time in research. The eight percent who strongly disagreed with the statement spend an average of only 19 percent of their time teaching and only 28 percent in research (most of the rest of their time is spent consulting or in professional service activities, which apparently was not anticipated). A little more than five out of six respondents (86 percent) reported that had they known then what they know now, they still would have enrolled in a Ph.D. program in economics."}, {"section_title": "VI. Salaries", "text": "Nominal salaries for employed respondents who held a full-time (permanent or temporary) job in the United States are reported in Table 3. The median is $74,000, up from $54,000 five years earlier, a compounded annual increase of 6.5 percent (Siegfried and Stock, 1999). The mean annual starting salary for those in full-time permanent jobs is $82,100, significantly higher than the $61,000 earned in such jobs by the 1996-97 cohort and almost $3,200 more than the average 2002-03 salary of full professors of economics in institutions at which the B.A. is the highest degree offered in economics (Scott and Siegfried, 2003). For those in higher education, the mean nine-month academic-year salary for the class of 2001-02 exceeds the average 2002-03 academic year salaries of assistant professors at Ph.D. granting universities by more than a thousand dollars. The gap at M.A. and B.A. institutions is, of course, much larger. The evidence suggests that salary compression has progressed to within-rank salary inversion. The median salary for all permanent full-time appointments is 60 percent higher than for all temporary full-time jobs. This premium was only 27 percent five years earlier, indicating rapidly growing competition for job candidates to fill permanent full-time appointments complemented with an underclass reserve-army of temporary full-time employees (e.g., visiting teaching faculty in academe). For those with permanent jobs, the 38 percent premium paid by business/industry relative to academe has stayed close to its level of five years earlier. As we did for the class of 1996-97, we conducted a rudimentary cross-section regression analysis of the natural logarithm of salary in order to identify independent correlations between various job characteristics and compensation. Our sample of 190 observations is limited to 2001-02 doctorates in economics employed in the U.S. in full-time permanent positions commencing no earlier than January 2001, thereby omitting from the analysis those graduates who clearly had settled into permanent employment prior to the 2001-02 job market. Academic year salaries were not inflated to match the calendar year salaries of others, on the grounds that most assistant professors work during the summer whether they are compensated or not. Many first and second year assistant professors receive summer compensation as part of a recruitment package. We did not include such supplemental compensation because presumably it is temporary. We analyzed base salaries only, as a more accurate reflection of net present values of lifetime income flows. We did not ask graduates or their advisors about fringe benefits because their responses would be too difficult to quantify comparably across individuals. For the regression analysis, salaries were adjusted for cost of living differentials at the job location relative to Washington, DC. The adjustments used the fourth quarter Ph.D. programs having seven or more graduates in the regression sample, for the sub-field of economics in which graduates specialized, for the employment sector of their job, for the type of institution at which academics were employed (indicators for Carnegie BA/BS institutions, MA/MS institutions, and two-year institutions; doctoral institutions are the benchmark), 7 and for whether an academic appointment is in a business school. The regression accounts for 38 percent of the variation in the natural logarithm of salaries (adjusted R-squared is 23 percent). Unless noted otherwise, all relationships described here are statistically significant at the five percent level or better (two-tailed tests). The regression reveals no significant difference in starting salary based on race, age, sex, marital status, citizenship, native language, or whether the graduates had children at the time they completed their Ph.D. Prior master's degrees or prior degrees in economics are also unrelated to starting salaries. Although one might speculate that starting salaries would be different for those graduates whose partner's job opportunities were important in the decision to take their job, a separate regression for the 126 graduates who rated the importance of their partner's job opportunities revealed no such relationship. Binary variables for universities that graduated at least seven doctorates (California-Berkeley, Chicago, Harvard, MIT, Stanford, and Wisconsin) indicate no difference in starting salary for graduates of any particular institution. When National Research Council (NRC) rank of the program where graduates earned their Ph.D. is substituted for the individual program indicators, the estimated coefficient indicates that graduates of more highly ranked programs earn more (about five percent more for each 20 rank improvement) (Marvin Goldberger et al., 1995). Binary variables denoting \"tiers\" suggest that the effect is primarily due to lower earnings of graduates from institutions ranked below 48 by the National Research Council. Graduates who specialize in public economics were predicted to earn 25 percent less than the benchmark, graduates in micro theory. No other field has starting salaries that differ significantly from micro theory. The regression estimates a salary penalty of 27 percent for academics working in master's level institutions relative to the benchmark of institutions where a doctorate is the highest degree awarded, but no significant penalty for those taking jobs in BA/BS schools. As with the 1996-97 cohort, academics working in a business school were predicted to earn more (26 percent more) than those in other administrative units. Once we control for the other factors in our regression, those working at international organizations (e.g., World Bank, IMF) earn a 23 percent premium and those working in research organizations incur a 20 percent shortfall in estimated salary relative to academics at doctorate-level institutions."}, {"section_title": "VII. Differences by Employment Sector", "text": "Demographic characteristics, employment outcomes, and responses to attitudinal questions are compared across employment sectors in Table 4. A distinct pattern is evident -those employed in business/industry are different from the other graduates. They earn more than their colleagues employed in most other sectors (although in the salary regression their salaries are not significantly different from academics at doctoral institutions), but they are less satisfied with their jobs. They view their jobs as less closely related to economics, less well connected to their education and training, and not what they expected to be doing upon graduation. Only 69 percent of them would have sought an economics doctorate if they had known at matriculation what they know after graduation. In view of their general level of dissatisfaction, it is surprising that those employed in permanent full-time jobs in business/industry are not much more likely to be seeking a new position than those in comparable jobs in other sectors. Perhaps their higher salaries are, at least in part, a compensating differential. Academics, on the other hand, earn lower salaries than those in other sectors, but view their jobs as more related to economics, more commensurate with their training, and more like what they expected to be doing when they began their Ph.D. study."}, {"section_title": "VIII. Differences by Ph.D. Program Rank", "text": "Because no new NRC rankings of quality of graduate programs have appeared since 1996-97, we grouped graduate programs into the same five \"tiers\" used in our earlier study (Goldberger et al., 1995) As they did five years earlier, the elite programs continue to enroll younger students and a higher proportion of non-U.S. citizens. Larger fractions of students from the top-tier programs wrote dissertations consisting of a set of essays rather than a single-topic treatise. Larger fractions of these graduates also had predominately no-work fellowship support, while a smaller fraction of them had predominately teaching assistant or government support; the opposite is true for those from Tier 5 institutions. Larger fractions of the top-tier graduates landed a full-time permanent job and both academic and non-academic salaries fall with rank of Ph.D. granting program. Graduates of first tier universities report the best fit with their job. They agree more frequently that their job is related to economics and is commensurate with their education. Nevertheless, there is little difference across program rank in whether graduates believe they still would have enrolled in an economics Ph.D. program if they had known when they matriculated what they knew about a year after they graduated."}, {"section_title": "IX. Differences by Economics Subfield", "text": "Demographic characteristics and employment outcomes are reported by economics subfield in Table 6. The high fraction of women in labor economics persists, with economic development, and health, education, and welfare economics also becoming popular among female economists. Women show little interest in financial economics. Non-citizens predominate in micro theory, macro/monetary, and international economics, while U.S. citizens dominate in labor economics and agricultural/natural resource economics. Dissertations are more likely to consist of a set of essays in international economics and macro/monetary economics; they are more likely to be a single-topic treatise for those graduating in public economics and economic development. There is no significant difference among the fields in the proportion of graduates who secure academic appointments. Labor economists seem to have the greatest difficulty securing full-time permanent jobs, industrial organization economists the least difficulty. Among U.S. academics, financial economists and industrial organization economists are more frequently located in business schools, while the opposite is true for those specializing in labor economics, economic development, or health, education, and welfare economics. There is almost no difference in salaries among the fields of specialization for nonacademics, the exception being international economists earn more than those in other fields. This may be related to the high salaries paid by the IMF and World Bank. Within academe, financial economists and industrial organization economists are paid the most, public economists the least. The former is related in part to the salary premium paid for economists employed by business schools. Indeed, once we controlled for this and other factors in the salary regression, except for the discount for public economics, all differences in salaries among the fields disappeared. gap between those with permanent full-time appointments and those in temporary jobs is approaching a chasm; the $11,800 gap that existed among graduates of the class of 1996-97 has widened to $30,000 for those graduating in 2001-02. Even among those in permanent positions, one in eight was sufficiently dissatisfied to be actively seeking a new job. If one adds the unemployed and those in temporary positions to this group, about one in four 2001-02 graduates was actively looking for work in early 2003. Among those with permanent positions who are seeking a new job, 15 percent are looking for positions outside of economics."}, {"section_title": "X. Conclusion", "text": "Graduates' responses to open ended questions in our survey reflect these different perspectives on the economics job market. Comments ranged from \"Markets work!!!\" to \"it's a jungle out there,\" \"2002 was the worst -or so I thought until 2003,\" and \"The job market was a good experience-but it is even better when it is over!\" 9 Not surprisingly, comments from graduates in temporary jobs tended to be more negative and their job satisfaction tended to be lower than those in permanent jobs. On the bright side, however, the vast majority of both groups agreed that having known then what they know now, they still would have pursued a Ph.D. in economics. Mary Golladay helped assemble NSF data. T. Aldrich Finegan, W. Lee Hansen, Ronald Ehrenberg, Daniel Hamermesh, Maresi Nerad, and Barbara Wolfe advised on the design of the study. We of course owe the largest thanks to the graduates and advisors who returned our survey questionnaires. 1 Over half (51 percent) of our sample earned a prior graduate degree before enrolling in their economics Ph.D. program. Most of these were from economics MA/MS programs. Since James McCoy and Martin Milkman (1995) estimate that the number of months typically taken by full-time students to graduate from economics MA/MS programs is 20 months, the NSF data and our sample responses would agree that, on average, the economics Ph.D. process took about 5.4 years for 2001-02 graduates. 2 The reason for the different totals is probably related to the method of classifying Ph.D.s into fields. The NSF asks individual graduates to classify their dissertation into an academic discipline. The JEL, in contrast, collects its list of graduates from departments, which may use criteria other than the content of the dissertation to judge whether a graduate is \"in economics.\" The fact that NSF recorded 21 economics Ph.D.s awarded in 2001-02 by institutions that did not offer a Ph.D. in economics illustrates the problem. How many may be similarly over-reported to NSF by graduates at institutions that do offer a Ph.D. in economics cannot be determined. 3 We could not locate a valid address for 126 of the 911 graduates listed in the JEL. One graduate died. Of the remaining 784, 37 graduated from Canadian universities, 84 (U.S.) reported (or their advisor reported) that they did not earn their degree during the period, and 52 (U.S.) earned their degrees from a department of agricultural economics, mineral economics, human resources and family studies, or another \"non-economics\" department, leaving a net of 611 possible U.S. economics respondents. We received 398 graduate surveys, 65 percent of the 611. 4 NSF data in Table 1 indicate only 57 percent of 2000-01 economics Ph.D.s majored in economics as undergraduates. If all double-majors in our data are assigned to the noneconomics undergraduate major, our proportion declines to 61 percent, reasonably close to the NSF figure. We do not know how NSF handled double-majors. 5 Estimation using a Cox proportional hazards model yielded qualitatively similar results. 6 All 16 of the outliers had a time-to-degree of more than 10 years. 7 The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching categorizes all colleges and universities in the United States. The classification system adopted in 2000 includes: doctoral/ research institutions (84 of the 114 graduates in the regression sample employed in academe were employed in these institutions), master's colleges and universities (19), baccalaureate colleges (9), and associate's colleges (2).
