[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract. As far back as history has been written in the islands today known as the US Virgin Islands (USVI), residents have had to endure and survive costly and deadly onslaughts from tropical storms such as the 1867 San Narciso Hurricane, Hurricane Hugo and Hurricane Marilyn. Keenly alerted by recent tragic events in the Indian Ocean in 2004, in Haiti in 2010 and in Japan in 2011, the USVI was reminded that it had suffered its greatest tsunami impact in a well-documented event that had followed the 1867 hurricane by fewer than three weeks. To address their community's continual vulnerability to coastal hazards, USVI emergency managers, scientists and educators, assisted by national and regional disaster management agencies and warning programs, have engaged programs for understanding, anticipating and mitigating these hazards. This paper focuses on how three public-serving institutions, the Virgin Islands Territorial Emergency Management Agency (VITEMA), the University of the Virgin Islands and the Caribbean Ocean Observing System have responded to the community's need for improved preparedness through programs of physical preparation, planning, research, observations, education and outreach. This report reviews some of the approaches and activities employed in the USVI in the hope of sharing their benefits with similarly vulnerable coastal communities."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "As a result of its location, the United States Virgin Islands (USVI), an island community of approximately 106 000 citizens, is at-risk for impacts from several coastal hazards. The natural disturbances of 1989 through 1999 created both demand and opportunity for advancing preparedness and awareness in the face of coastal natural hazards in the USVI. This was the period when Hurricanes Marilyn, Lenny and other storms destroyed and terrorized the community and when also Montserrat's Soufriere Hills volcano returned to activity after more than 300 years (Wallace, 2006) . After decades relatively unscathed, many of the communities of the Caribbean experienced a succession of direct hits and near misses by severe tropical storms. At the same time, even at a safe distance from significant direct fallout, the people of the northeast Caribbean were provided with worrisome front row seats to the hazard that the newly awakened volcano represents. (Nealon and Dillon, 2001) . They are rated by the 1997 Uniform Building Code as a Seismic Zone 4 (IVI International, 2014)."}, {"section_title": "R. A.

Before he migrated to the US to eventually become one of its founding fathers -Chief of Staff to General George Washington, member of the Continental Congress, Secretary of the Treasury, and founder of the Federalist Party -Alexander Hamilton lived in St. Croix and witnessed the destructive and deadly hurricane of 1772. In a letter penned to his father and later published he described the experience and impacts of the storm, \". . . A great part of the buildings throughout the Island are levelled to the ground -almost all the rest very much shattered -several persons killed and numbers utterly ruined -whole families running about the streets unknowing where to find a place of shelter -the sick exposed to the keenness of water and air -without a bed to lie upon-or a dry covering to their bodies -our harbour is entirely bare . . . \" (Hamilton, 1772) .\nUSVI communities have long recognized tropical storms to be their primary natural hazard threat. As shown in Fig. 1 , the USVI is located in the area designated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center as the Main Development Region (MDR) for Atlantic tropical storms that originate off the West African coast.\nFor example in 1713, 1772 and 1819, 1837, 1867 and 1916 , severe hurricanes impacted these islands, which until 1917 were the Danish West Indies (Dookhan, 1974) . The most fatal of all occurred on 29 October 1867 and resulted in the loss of more than 500 lives with massive destruction to residential property, infrastructure and the vessels of several nations (vanHousel, 1878) . Significantly damaging tropical storm events have continued to the present, often interspersed with long periods of quiet. After the Danish West Indies became the US Virgin Islands, the years 1924, 1928, and 1932 brought more destructive storms. Among modernnamed storms, Tropical Storm Betsy (1956) and Hurricane Donna (1960) threatened the communities and damaged reefs but did not devastate the islands. In 1984 Klaus surprised the islands by causing more wind damage and flooding than was expected from a tropical storm, although it was soon to become a hurricane.\nThe havoc that Hurricane Gilbert wreaked in Jamaica in 1988 after passing south of the Virgin Islands captured the attention of its people and, in retrospect, is seen as a preview of the stunning impact that Hurricane Hugo would make locally the next year. Hugo took lives, severely damaged USVI infrastructure and had a negative impact on its economy, particularly on St. Croix. The Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI) reported that, \". . . losses of $ 1.5 billion (mostly concentrated on St. Croix) included damage or destruction of 95 percent of the buildings and 90 percent of the power supply system . . . . Nearly every public building on the island, including the hospital, schools, housing projects and shelters, sustained major damage or were destroyed\" (FEMA, 2008; EERI, 2014) . The St. Croix Foundation, for example, committed itself in 1990 to assist St. Croix, \". . . after Hurricane Hugo destroyed St. Croix's socioeconomic fabric in 1989\" (St. Croix Foundation, 2014) .\nIn 1995 Hurricane Marilyn, rivaling Hurricane Hugo, was the most destructive of a series of hurricanes and tropical storms that would hit or graze the islands throughout that decade and further weaken the slowly recovering economy. As shown in Fig. 2 , employment, as a credible measure of economic and social health, reflected the reality of the negative impacts of hurricanes.\nImpact of storms on the USVI economy is further illustrated by examining General Fund Revenues for a period of storm activity as in Fig. 3 . As the USVI Department of Finance reported, \"Revenues in 1996 were down approximately 8.1 percent to $ 347 million (mostly due to a drop in revenues after Hurricanes Marilyn and Bertha) . . . \" (Department of Finance, Government of the US Virgin Islands). By the time the 1999 Hurricane Lenny had spread its disruption along its unusual path from west to east, scientific explanations of natural cycles of hurricane intensification only heightened the public's anxiety about hazards to which their islands could be susceptible (Goldenberg et al., 2001 ; Climate Prediction Center, 2013)."}, {"section_title": "Tsunamis", "text": "Anxiety about the threat of tsunamis may have started in the USVI in 1995 when the general public heard suggestions that collapse of the flanks of Montserrat's volcano could generate destructive waves or that the submarine volcano in the southeastern Caribbean, Kick-'em-Jenny, could erupt with enough energy to send tsunamis across the Caribbean. But eventually concern about these possibilities led to the recovery from forgotten history of the well-documented earthquake and tsunami of 1867 when the USVI were ruled by Denmark and known as the Danish West Indies.\nAt 16:50 UTC on 18 November 1867, triggered by abrupt and energetic rupture on the floor of the Virgin Islands Basin, an earthquake with magnitude between 7.2 and 7.5 (Barkan and ten Brink, 2010; Zahibo, et al., 2003) , generated tsunami waves that began inundating the shoreline communities of the surrounding islands -Frederiksted, Charlotte Amalie, Christiansted, Road Town -within approximately 10 min. Waves of 7 m were recorded around the basin but wave heights as great as 10 m were recorded at two locations in Guadeloupe (Zahibo et al., 2003) . Tsunami waves propagated cross the Caribbean to inflict coastal damage as far away as Grenada. By the time the waves had abated, coastal devastation of infrastructure, homes and marine industries was extensive. Commerce was damaged, yet the loss of life was surprisingly low with fewer than 30 people killed in the Danish West Indies by both earthquake and tsunami and only a small numbers of fatalities occurred in the British Virgin Islands and eastern Puerto Rico. A survey of the islands' topography reveals an abundance of promontories overlooking populated at-risk coastal areas. It is commonly conjectured that the proximity of these hills made escape routes accessible. Low mortality in the 1867 catastrophe may also reflect the relatively small population at the time (Dookhan, 1984) . Further, at mid-afternoon, workers in the dominant industry of the period would be found inland and upland on farms and plantations."}, {"section_title": "Vulnerability today", "text": "The prospect of a similar tsunami striking these same shores today is frightening and is much discussed. In 1867 the population of the Danish West Indies was approximately 37 000 (Dookhan, 1974) , that number has now almost tripled (CIA, 2014) . Instead of inland, upland on plantations and farms, most of today's industries are headquartered on the coast. USVI tourism, the main industry, is largely focused on coastal activity. On an average day in tourism high season, as many as six cruise ships, each bearing several thousand passengers and crew, may rest in the Charlotte Amalie harbor. Even on St. Croix, where a more extensive interior provides inland recreational and educational activities for visitors, marine and coastal activities still comprise the substance of accommodations for tourists. Much of the Islands' infrastructure is found on the coast as well (Watlington, 2006) . The modified Google Earth satellite view in Fig. 4 reveals cruise ship docks, container and shipping ports, airports, gift shops and tourism recreation facilities on St. Thomas -all within coastal areas known to have been inundated by the 1867 tsunami. In addition, many government offices, some schools and some public housing are also found at vulnerable elevations. Storm surge modeling predicts inundation depths (1) Shoreline university buildings, (2) airport, (3) airplane fuel storage, (4) sewage treatment plant, (5) three shoreline hotels, (6) electricity and desalination plants with storage tanks, (7) 3-berth dock that accommodates the world's largest cruise ships, (8) marina and container port, (9) school for > 900 students, (10) downtown shopping and historic district, (11) courts, police station and jail, (12) 85-unit senior citizens home, (13) cruise ship dock and upscale marina, (14) two public housing projects with 417 dwellings and (15) hotel/resort. between 0.10 and 2.29 m in this zone during a category 5 hurricane (Benitez and Mercado, 2014) ."}, {"section_title": "Community responses and expectations", "text": "The coastal catastrophes that occurred in USVI over the past three decades along with the vulnerabilities that have been revealed resulted in many constructive responses from various levels of the society. While acceptance of these vulnerabilities may have weakened many individuals' self-confidence in their ability to persevere in the face of severe natural events and diminished confidence in government leaders and emergency managers, appropriate responses to these threats by individuals and government alike became evident even as new tropical storms threatened.\nA survey conducted after Hurricane Georges in 1998 identified behaviors in private citizens consistent with a commitment to secure safety during cataclysmic events. Eighty percent of the study's participants knew how to appreciate the threat that an approaching hurricane would represent for three days or more in advance and took warnings seriously. Further eighty-one percent indicated that they were well prepared with supplies before the hurricane (Sattler et al., 2000) .\nThe US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was able to assist the Government of the Virgin Islands in improving building codes in order, \". . . to attempt to accommodate the hurricanes or earthquakes that are now known to be possible with citizens being encouraged to build their houses with consideration given to storm-resistant designs and measures and to comply more carefully with these codes\". For example, the new code requires hurricane resistant measures such as anchoring systems, hurricane clips and shutters (DHS, 2014) . DHS assisted other mitigation projects including, \". . . the strengthening of infrastructure facilities and a massive public education outreach to contractors and owners about proper construction practices and other mitigation strategies\". Then after Hurricane Marilyn, the Governor's Home Protection Roofing Program was established to repair damaged roofs and design them to withstand a Category 2 storm (DHS, 2014) .\nIn spite of these efforts, preparedness to face coastal hazards while at the same time considering the region's seismic portent requires even more of the Government, more of the individual, and more acceptance of responsibility by other sectors of the community. This expectation provides an opportunity for organizations with special capabilities to help meet the challenge of awareness and preparedness for coastal hazards.\n3 Coordinated management of risk and responsibility for preparedness"}, {"section_title": "Mission and activities of the Virgin Islands Territorial Emergency Management Agency", "text": "Official responsibility and authority for providing the people of the US Virgin Islands with disaster preparedness and warning is vested in the Virgin Islands Territorial Emergency Management Agency (VITEMA), which was created in 1985 with the overarching mission of saving lives and property. At that time, and even more so after the onslaughts of Hugo, Marilyn and the others, the Territory's preparedness effort was hurricane-centric, focusing on readiness for the Atlantic hurricane season. This was but one of the challenges the new office faced. Twenty-three years later, to address inefficiencies in the emergency management, the Governor of the US Virgin Islands, John P. de Jongh Jr. made improving the system a top priority of his administration and an all-hazards approach was adopted. Early accomplishments included the modernization of the Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs) and of the 911 system, on duty 24 h daily every day, the creation of a Virgin Islands Fusion Center and the opening of the campaign to achieve recognition as TsunamiReady TM (i.e. \"Tsunami Ready\") by the US National Weather Service (NWS)."}, {"section_title": "Restructuring", "text": "The Fusion Center is a unit of VITEMA's Office of Homeland Security established by the Governor's Executive Order to improve intelligence gathering and sharing among public safety and public service agencies.

The reorganized agency began expanding its vision to readiness for allhazards, natural and anthropogenic, including earthquakes, tsunamis, tropical storms and acts of terrorism. Throughout VITEMA's transformation, critical steps were taken to make the vision of all-hazards readiness an achievable goal, looking at existing practices in managing incidents, strengths and gaps in our existing strategic plans, and at the capability of the homeland security office (Lewis, 2014) . This analysis resulted in strengthened emergency response and recovery capabilities, improved planning, communications, coordination and cooperation, and renewed internal organizational strength.\nAlso a result of its reorganization, VITEMA achieved compliance with the US National Incident Management System (NIMS), which was developed by the Department of Homeland Security for the management of incidents. This system allows various levels of government, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector to work seamlessly to respond to and recover from disasters, regardless of the cause, size, location, or complexity.

The TTWG, comprised of representatives of the private and public sector, worked together to develop a decision matrix for choosing the initial communities in the Territory in which to pursue tsunami-readiness. The decision matrix included each site's population density, location and elevation, proximity to safe areas and feasibility for tsunami readiness at the present time. VITEMA also conducted the first tsunami-specific preparedness exercise ever held in the Virgin Islands in October 2011.
