Based on the current epidemiological investigations, the incubation period of COVID-19 is about 1-14 days, with a median time of 3-7 days, and can be up to 24 days in a tiny minority of cases from exposure to symptoms onset [1] [2] [3] . Viral shedding may begin 2-3 days before the presence of the first symptom [4] . Median duration of viral shedding has found to be 20.0 days and the longest duration could be up to 37 days in survivors, while the viral RNA in non-survivors could be detected until death [5] . In the cases of severe COVID-19 patients, the median duration of viral shedding has shown to be 31.0 days from illness onset."}, {"section_title": "(3) Transmission", "text": "Novel coronavirus is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplet, aerosol, direct or indirect contact. Several studies have provided epidemiological evidences that human-to-human transmission of novel coronavirus in family, hospitals, and even across cities were occurred [6] [7] [8] .\nGuan et al found that patterns of human-to-human transmission included familial aggregation [6] , asymptomatic virus carrier [9] , and the three-phase outbreak [10] , which were in accordance with other findings. The \"super-spreaders\" may occur in this pandemic [1] . Prominently, infected persons without symptoms during the incubation period could be sources of infection, suggesting the asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [9, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . The rapid and uncontrollable spread of this virus may ascribe to the \"silent transmission\" by some patients with atypical symptoms."}, {"section_title": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f", "text": "More and more evidences have proved that this virus can spread through multiple routes as well. To et al detected the self-collected saliva, a non-invasive specimen, by one-step real-time RT-qPCR assay targeting the S protein [6] . They obtained the positive results that were consistent with those detected through nasopharyngeal or sputum specimens, which may be due to the infection of epithelial cells in saliva gland ducts or the secretions from nasopharynx and lung in the saliva. Therefore, virus in saliva may allow transmission via speaking or coughing [16] .\nZhang et al firstly reported the presence of viral nucleotide in anal swabs and blood. During the later stage of infection, the level of viral RNA was higher in anal swab than in blood, suggesting the possibility of multiple routes transmission of virus including oral-fecal or body fluid route [17] . Studies of Xiao et al have shown that the viral RNA tested in feces was positive even in gastrointestinal tracts was negative [18] . Another two findings emphasized that the diarrhea as onset symptom should not be ignored and the fecal-oral transmission route should be taken seriously [19, 20] . Chen et al analyzed the viral RNA levels in pharyngeal, swab, blood, and the anal swab by real-time PCR. The concentrations of viral RNA in blood and anal swabs were positively correlated with the severity of COVID-19. Since the spike protein of novel coronavirus interacts with the host ACE2 receptor for viral attachment and entry to establish infection, the presence of viral RNA in digestive tract in which ACE2 is abundantly expressed confirmed the viral replication in extrapulmonary sites. Early detection of viral RNA in the blood and digestive tract may be helpful in predicting the progression of COVID-19 [21] .\nA clinician who wore an N95 mask but not safety goggles was infected with SARS-CoV-2 while working with COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, suggesting the potential transmission through mucous membranes in the eyes [22] . Despite no detectable viral RNA was in the conjunctival swabs samples from infected patients reported in the further studies [23] , Deng et al have confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted through ocular conjunctival route in a rhesus macaques model, cautioning us the necessity of eye protection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 [24] .\nChen et al reported potential vertical transmission in nine pregnant women with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection. When the newborns were delivered by caesarean section, amniotic fluid, cord blood, throat swabs from newborns, and breastmilk were collected for testing and all of them were negative for the novel coronavirus. Currently there is no conclusive evidence supporting that women with COVID-19 in the late trimester of pregnancy could cause intrauterine infection due to vertical transmission. However, this investigation is restricted to the small number of cases and the pregnant women in the third trimester [25, 26] . It should be noted that infants and pregnant women remain susceptible to COVID-19 infection. Special care should be taken to prevent neonatal infections from mothers with COVID-19.\nOverall, the above studies warn the virus transmission through multiple routes including respiratory tract, alimentary tract, nasolacrimal system, oral-fecal, and body fluid route, and that the potential maternal-fetal vertical transmission should not be ignored. The properties of viral shedding before symptoms appear and via multiple routes indicate the strong infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 and pose a huge challenge in controlling the spread of disease."}, {"section_title": "III. Virology of SARS-CoV-2", "text": "SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the family coronaviruses and subgenus sarbecovirus (beta-CoV lineage B) and is a new strain virus distinct from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) and\nMiddle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 shows more than 85% identity to a bat SARS-like CoV (bat-SL-CoVZC45, MG772933.1) [27] . Its The ORF1ab gene accounts for two-thirds of the genome and encodes 16 nonstructural proteins (NSP1-NSP16) while the remaining genome encodes 4 structural proteins (S,   M , E, N) and 6 accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF10 ) [28] [29] [30] [31] .\nCurrently more than 40,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes publicly available (https://www.gisaid.org/ https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/release_genome# ) represent the genomic diversity of the virus in the world. Though all sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes share more than 99% similarity, it has been found that there are at least two hypervariable genomic hotspots. One is a silent mutation in the ORF1ab, the other one is an amino acid polymorphism (Serine/Leucine) in ORF8 which is predicted to induce structural disorder of the protein in the C-terminal portion [30] . 149 mutations were identified in 103 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and through population genetic analyses, investigators uncovered two major types of SARS-CoV-2 in circulation (L and S type) based on two tightly linked SNPs at position 8,782 and 28,144. The S type (~30%) is the ancestral version while L type (~70%) is derived from S type, although L type is more prevalent and more aggressive in the outbreak. Based upon the evolution of novel coronavirus, there may be great distinctions in transmissibility, pathogenicity, and virulence between S and L type [32] . Forster et al analyzed 160 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes by phylogenetic network and found three central variants named A, B, and C. The genome of type A is the most closely related to the bat coronavirus, which is supposed to be the \"root of the outbreak\". Type A is mainly found in United States and Australia. Type B is distinguished from type A by two mutations T8782C and C28144T, and is prevalent in Wuhan and East Asia. It seems that type B is resistant outside Ease Asia populations, since type B is not intended to spread outside East Asia without further mutated. Type C is derived from type B by the mutation G26144T and mainly found in Europeans, and also found in Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea but absent in mainland China [33] .\nIn addition to the viral mutations mentioned above, the human genetic variation may partly contribute to the geographical variations in the prevalence and mortality of COVID-19 pandemic. Prevalence and mortality data of the COVID-19 infections from European, African, Mediterranean, Middle East and Asian countries were included in the study. They found that the frequency of ACE1 D-allele was negatively correlated with prevalence of COVID-19, suggesting the confounded role of ACE1 D/I polymorphism in the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and the outcome of the infection [34] [35] [36] [37] . While complement component 3 (C3) polymorphism, a central component of the innate immune system, has been found to be a principal component of gene frequencies among European populations and a crucial determinant for COVID-19 prevalence and mortality [37] . Dai's paper suggested infected patients carrying A allele of ABO blood group type especially those with cardiovascular diseases in particular hypertension, tend to develop severe COVID-19 [38] . SARS-CoV-2 virion particles are enveloped, roughly spherical or moderately polymorphic with diameter ranging from 80-160 nm [39] . SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins necessary for virion particle formation, and four highly conserved nonstructural proteins including papain-like protease (PLpro, nsp3), 3CL-protease (3CLpro, nsp5), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, nsp12), and helicase (nsp 13) [40] that are needed for viral RNA replication [41, 42] . The N protein forms a ribonucleoprotein complex with viral RNA. The S protein is responsible for virus entry to the host cell by binding to the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The width of the S protein is about 7 nm, and the length is about 23 nm [39] . S protein has unique insertion of four amino acids (PRRA), which is a furin-like or TMPRSS2 cleavage site [43, 44] . S protein can be cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits.\nWhen the S1 subunit is dissociated, S2 undergoes a conformational change, extending itself from a compressed form to a nail shape. S1 is the receptor binding domain that helps the virus attach to the surface of the host cell, then the cellular proteases prime the S protein and cleave it at specific site, thereby promoting the S2 mediated fusion process of virus with host cell membrane. The Nsp5 may affect the transport of endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Some viral proteins also showed interaction with natural immune signaling proteins involved in IFN pathway, NF-\u03baB pathway, etc, which may take part in cytokine storm. 69 compounds were found to target these protein interactions including FDA approved drugs, compounds in clinical trials, and preclinical compounds. Based on screening assays, two broad sets of drugs and compounds: mRNA translation inhibitors and Sigma1 and Sigma2 receptor modulators, were showed to exert antiviral activity [47] ."}, {"section_title": "IV. Clinical and laboratory manifestations (1) Clinical manifestations", "text": "The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 range from asymptomatic infection, to flu-like illness such as fever, cough, dry cough and fatigue, to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and even multi-organ failures with high morbidity and mortality. The clinical diversity of non-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f specific signs and symptoms is poorly understood and seems to be correlated to the age, underlying comorbidities, and immunity status of the individual.\nWang et al reported 138 hospitalized cases of 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia in which most patients had fever, fatigue, dry cough, lymphopenia, prolonged prothrombin time, and higher level of lactate dehydrogenase [14] . Specifically, abnormal coagulation features including higher D-dimer and fibrin degradation product levels, longer prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, are significantly associated with poor prognosis [48] . Chest CT scans in the lungs of all patients showed ground glass opacity or bilateral patchy shadows [14] . But a larger scale of research on 1,099 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces throughout China showed that a certain amount of patients did not have fever or abnormalities on chest CT, making the diagnosis more complicating [1] . Severe patients who received intensive care unit (ICU) care were more likely to have two or more underlying comorbidities that usually associated with poor clinical outcomes. Hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes were the most common comorbidities, while chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was less common. Other comorbidities include pharyngeal pain, dizziness, abdominal pain, dyspnea, anorexia, cerebrovascular diseases, hepatitis B infections, chronic kidney diseases, and malignancy, and complications include acute respiratory distress syndrome [47] , arrhythmia, and shock [14, 49] .\nThe fact that SARS-CoV could attack the nervous system was confirmed by the viral genome sequence detected in the infected patients' cerebrospinal fluid. In the findings of Mao et al, more than 30% patients showed the neurological manifestations including central nervous system symptoms (headache, dizziness, disturbance of consciousness, epilepsy, etc), peripheral nervous system symptoms (decreased taste, decreased smell, decreased appetite, neuralgi, etc), and skeletal muscle injury. The neurological symptoms were more frequent in severe patients than in non-severe patients. It is worth noting that the first symptoms of some patients occurred in the nervous system, such as facial paralysis, hallucinations, etc. The virus circulation in the blood and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f crossing the blood-brain barrier, as well as the highly expression levels of ACE2 in vascular endothelial cells of nervous system and in smooth muscle cells of skeletal muscle, may contribute to the viral infection in nervous system [50] . On March 4, a 56-year-old COVID-19 patient in China was firstly reported to present with viral encephalitis (https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-03-06/new-research-sparks-debate-over-whether-coronavirus-can-infect-the-nervous-system-101524986.html). Though this is a rare case, in terms of clinical treatment, it provides some important indications. When the central nervous system is infected, cerebral edema or even hernia may occur, which is life-threatening. It is necessary to monitor the neurological indicators to avoid the death. Since the primary damage of SARS-CoV-2 infection is mainly in the lungs, whether viral infection leading to pathological damage in other tissues and organs is primary or secondary remains to be further investigated."}, {"section_title": "(2) Laboratory manifestations", "text": "Laboratory abnormalities provide some vital implications that may serve as predictors for severity of disease. Older age, higher sequential organ failure assessment score, and levels of D-dimer greater than 1 \u00b5g/mL were three potential risk factors related to poor prognosis, as reported by Zhou et al [5] . White blood cells count, neutrophil count, and levels of D-dimer, creatine kinase, and creatine were higher in ICU patients compared to non-ICU patients [14] . Liu et al found that the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 from patients' respiratory tracts was positively correlated to the lung disease severity. Albumin, percentage of lymphocytes and neutrophils, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein were highly associated to the acute lung injury and may be useful to predict the disease severity. Notably, the angiotensin II levels in the plasma of the infected patients were markedly higher than that in healthy persons and strongly related to viral load and pulmonary injury, suggesting the potential treatment with angiotensin receptor blockers for COVID-19 [51] . , levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GCSF,   IP10 , MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u03b1 in plasma were higher in ICU patients as compared to non-ICU patients [54] . However, the questions that remains unanswered are: How does the body perceive the virus and release cytokines? Why and how higher levels of cytokines cause the deterioration of clinical conditions and even mortality? Which cytokines and their pathways can be potential therapeutic targets? In response to viral infections, the host needs to effectively mobilize the immune system to clear virus and avoid the cytokine storm triggered by over activation. Our understanding of virus-induced cytokine storms and the balance between immune system and virus is still limited. To address these problems, we still have a long way to go."}, {"section_title": "VI. Detection and diagnosis (1) Nucleic acid testing", "text": "Currently, nucleic acid testing kits are commercial available and still the gold standard to confirm the presence of the SARS-CoV-2. Chu's group has established two one-step quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assays. Primers binding to the ORF1b and N genes of subgenus sarbecoviruses respectively were used to amplify the viral genome. But these developed assays couldn't distinguish SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and other sarbecoviruses, further sequence analyses of amplicons that are positive in RT-PCR results are required to confirm the species [55] . Shirato et al have developed two nested RT-PCR assays with primers bounding to the ORF1 and S protein, and two real-time RT-PCR assays with primers binding to the sequence encoding N protein, successfully detecting 25 SARS-CoV-2 positive infected patients in Japan [56] . Corman et al have designed a workflow for diagnosis of novel coronavirus without the virus isolates available.\nMaking use of the genetically similarity to 2003 SARS-CoV and synthetic nucleic acid technology, they have developed three RT-PCR assays as follows, primers binding to E gene can detect bat-associated SARS-related coronaviruses; specific probe hybridizing to RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) was used to make a distinction between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV; the RT-PCR assay designed to amplify the region of N gene was less sensitive so that it was not further validated [57] .\nNormally the throat and nasal swab in the upper respiratory tract of the patients are sampled for nucleic acid testing, which is fast and convenient for physicians to operate and causes no trauma to the patients. Nonetheless, novel coronavirus mainly infects the lower respiratory tract and the viral load in the upper respiratory tract may not be high enough for detection, resulting in false negatives [58] . In addition, given the viral replicative activity is influenced by the host immune system, it is possible that one has clinical symptoms but the quantity of virus is not sufficient for detection, leading to the occurrence of false negative results as well. What's more, the progression and severity of pneumonia cannot be concluded based on the real-time RT PCR results. Infected patients with false negative RNA results bring enormous challenges for medical workers to provide appropriate treatment and take isolation measures in time. Diagnosing the confirmed COVID-19 cases merely by nucleic acid testing is obviously not accurate enough."}, {"section_title": "(2) Chest CT images", "text": "The most common manifestations of chest CT in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia are ground glass opactities and patchy consolidation in bilateral lungs. According to the distributions and types of lesions, chest CT manifestations can be divided into three stages: at the early stage, only a single ground-glass opacity or irregular solid nodules of varying sizes can be seen. As the infection progresses, ground-glass opactities with a rounded morphology, reticulation, or crazy paving pattern and patchy, parenchyma or mixed consolidation distributed in the middle and peripheral area of bilateral lungs may present. Nodules involving multiple lobes are increased and enlarged. A few patients may have small pleural effusions. When the disease progresses to a critical stage, more extensive pulmonary consolidation and ground-glass opactities, diffuse pulmonary lesions, increased density of bilateral lungs and even \"white lung\" may appear. Pleural J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f effusions, lymphadenopathy and an air bronchogram sign may present in a small number of patients [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] . A clinical trial involving in using CT scores to predict the mortality of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia have been completed (NCT04284046).\nIt is not surprising that patients have false negative results in nucleic acid testing but the CT images show some features of novel coronavirus infection [65] . Therefore, in the latest edition of China's diagnosis and treatment guidelines for new coronavirus pneumonia, chest CT scan is one of the clinical diagnosis standards of suspected cases and the nucleic acid testing kit is then used to make a clinical diagnosis of confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infection."}, {"section_title": "(3) Antibody detection", "text": "Not as nucleic acid testing or Chest CT images that can detect acute infection, antibody tests detects the person ever infected, especially those with asymptomatic infection. IgG and IgM antibodies in serum of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients arise simultaneously or sequentially within around 1 to 3 weeks after illness onset [66] . N and different forms of S protein are the major antigens for detecting the antibodies induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Different types of assays for antibody testing can be applied to assess different aspects of immunological response and function of antibodies induced by virus infection.\nZhao et al have developed a serology ELISA kit using CHO cell expressing fully glycosylated, full length SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein for surveillance of the infection at the early stage.\nGlycosylation of S1 protein is important to facilitate the protein folding properly and increase the protein's affinity to the receptor, ensuring the great sensitivity and high specificity of the ELISA kit [67] . Padoan Without PCR amplification, the results can be read out in less than an hour (https://www.broadinstitute.org/files/publications/special/COVID19%20detection%20(updated). iLACO is rather sensitive that can detect as low as 10 copies of the targeted ORF1ab gene in 15-40 minutes.

Recently, chloroquine were tested against SARS-CoV-2 with EC 90 at low micromolar concentration and may restrict the viral entry and post entry processes in vitro [75] . Chloroquine is an immunomodulation agent that may enhance its antiviral activity as well.\nIn light of the safety and potent efficacy, clinical study testing chloroquine against pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 is being conducting (NCT04261517). Preliminary results from the multicenter clinical trials conducted in China have demonstrated that chloroquine phosphate effectively inhibited the progression of pneumonia, eliminated the virus, and shortened the duration of diseases without any severe adverse effects [92, 93] . However, data of an open label, randomized controlled trial conducted in China (ChiCTR2000029868) enrolling patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 and two observational studies involving a large number of consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in New York City did not support the use of hydroxychloroquine because it was not associated with either a significantly higher or lower risk of intubation or death, or lower in-hospital mortality [94] [95] [96] .

During the outbreak of SARS-CoV, infected patients treated with convalescent plasma carrying SARS-CoV-specific antibodies from cured patients have been suggested to yield clinical benefits with reduced viral load and lower mortality rate [107] .

PD-1 blocking antibody is one of the anticancer drugs that prevents the interaction between PD-L1 on the tumor cells and PD-1 on the T cells. Blocking the interaction of these cell surface proteins can modulate the immunological tolerance of tumors, thus preventing the cancer cells from evading the surveillance of immune system [110] . Diao et al reported that the expression levels of T cell exhaustion marker PD-1 from COVID-19 patients were much higher as compared to healthy controls [111] . Therefore, blocking PD-1 to prevent T cell exhaustion resulting in activation of antiviral immune responses may be a novel therapeutic strategy for COVID-19. However, before applying the PD-1 blocking antibody for treatment of lymphocytopenia induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection (NCT04268537), the correlation between PD-1 and T cell function should be measured to predict the response rate and the adverse effects such as cytokine-release syndromes and pneumonitis. -2 admitted to the intensive care unit had cytokine storms with   increased secretion of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u03b1, associated with severe illness including acute respiratory distress syndrome and organ failure [102] ."}, {"section_title": "Patients infected with SARS-CoV", "text": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be an immunomodulatory agent inhibiting the secretion of cytokines, suppressing the overactive immune responses, and decreasing the inflammation.

Based on TCM therapy concept of \"multiple compounds-multiple targets-multiple effects\", a TCM prescription often contains multiple herbs working together to battle a disease. Within these mixture components, some work directly on the viral targets involving the life cycle including attachment, entry, transcription of viral mRNA, replication of viral genome, translation of viral protein, and the assembly, maturation and release of progeny virus particles [119] . To infect the host efficiently, viruses have evolved a series of strategies to escape the host's innate and adaptive immune responses against viral infection. On the other hand, to fight against the virus, the host may release excessive or uncontrolled proinflammatory cytokines that correlated to tissue damage or organ failure [102] . Except working as direct-acting antivirals, most of the molecules in TCM are immunomodulators that could block the viral immune evasion or enhance the host antiviral immune responses, while the others may contribute to reducing the toxicity or enhancing the bioavailability [119] . Despite not often being recognized as a real medicine, TCMs actually have exhibited excellent anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy during the outbreak of COVID-19 as evidenced by the high recovery rate and low mortality rate of confirmed cases taking TCM in China [82, 120] .

In the 7 th edition of the diagnostic and treatment guidelines for the COVID-19 issued by Chinese health authorities, Xiyanping injection is recommended for treating severe and critically ill patients with bacterial co-infection attributed to its antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and immune regulation activities.

Specific antibodies of anti-SARS-CoV-2 were found to mainly distribute in the lungs after immunization. SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific T cell responses were also stimulated in immunized mice [125] . "}, {"section_title": "(6) Other treatments (a) Washed microbiota transplantation", "text": "ACE2 not only expresses in the lung tissue, but also distributes in the intestinal epithelium [126] .\nApart from invading the host's lung tissues, SARS-CoV-2 also interferes with the absorption of nutrients in the human body by binding to ACE2 of the intestinal epithelium, causing gastrointestinal discomfort [14] . The intestinal flora can regulate various lung diseases through the intestinal-lung axis with immunomodulatory effect, including viral pneumonia, asthma, tuberculosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Maintaining the normal communication of intestinal-pulmonary axis is helpful to alleviate lung disease [127, 128] . Intestinal malnutrition often occurs in patients with COVID-19 and sometimes develops to secondary bacterial infections and antibiotic-related diarrhea, suggesting the crucial connection between intestinal tract and respiratory tract. Washed microbiota transplantation as a rescue therapy for critically ill patients with diarrhea may have important clinical benefits (NCT04251767)."}, {"section_title": "(b) Vitamin C", "text": "Vitamin C, a kind of antioxidant, is essential for tissue repair and immune system function [129] .\nVitamin C can prevent oxidative damage induced by virus infection and improve the immunity of patients with pneumonia. It has been reported that enterovirus/rhinovirus infection can cause J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f devastating acute lung injury. High dose of intravenous vitamin C could attenuate the acute respiratory distress syndrome and relieve lung damage produced by enterovirus/rhinovirus infection. Down-regulation of reactive oxygen, nitrogen species, and pro-inflammatory genes by vitamin C may contribute to these curative effect [130, 131] . Nevertheless, the role of vitamin C as monotherapy in the recovered patients is still uncertain. Before vitamin C can be applied as a therapy, the side effects of high dosage, such as nausea, indigestion, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea owing to the unabsorbed vitamin C in the intestine should be considered. Since the leading causes of death of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are associated with acute respiratory distress and multiple organ failure, further investigations and larger trials should be performed to uncover the underlying mechanism and evaluate the exact efficacy of vitamin C.\nThe strong infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need of early intervention with effective treatment. Although abundant clinical trials are registered and underway since the outbreak of COVID-19, the exact pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 has not been elucidated clearly yet, along with no approved drug or vaccine for either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV as a reference, raising a significant challenge for specific and effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug development.
