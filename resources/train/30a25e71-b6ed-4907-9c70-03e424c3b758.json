Introduction", "text": "T HE validity of program impact estimates based on an experimental design is a powerful reason for the increasing use of experimental designs. By creating a treatment group and a control group that are similar along all characteristics (both observed and unobserved) that can affect outcomes, experimental designs support simple estimators of a program impact-the difference in average outcomes of the treatment and control groups-and its standard error.\nDespite their appeal, experimental designs can be difficult to implement in many settings. For example, program operators often are reluctant to implement experimental designs when their programs are operating below capacity. Experimental designs also are difficult to implement when all individuals who are eligible for program services are affected by the treatment (for example, as in statewide welfare reform efforts). In cases such as these, a nonexperimental design that produced valid impact estimates would have great appeal.\nThe findings reported in a recent article by Dehejia and Wahba (1999) suggest that the propensity-score method-a nonexperimental method developed some time ago but not widely used to evaluate social programs-may have the potential to produce impacts similar to ones that experiments would produce. Dehejia and Wahba showed that the propensity-score method yielded impacts of a job training program on earnings that were close to what experimental methods yielded. The propensity-score method estimates impacts by comparing outcomes of a treatment group with outcomes of a select group of individuals who, on average, are similar to the treatment group along an array of observed characteristics. The select group of individuals (hereafter, the comparison group) is identified from a sample of potential comparison group members using the propensity score-a single number that indicates the extent to which one person is similar to another along a collection of observed characteristics (Rubin, 1973) .\nThese findings raise the issue of whether propensity-score methods can replicate experimental impacts of programs in other settings and for other outcomes. In theory, propensityscore methods produce unbiased estimates of treatment effects if all characteristics related to both treatment status and outcomes are observed (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983) . In many social programs, treatment group members include individuals who were both eligible for and interested in receiving program services. The characteristics used to determine eligibility often are known, making it possible to select a comparison group that is similar to the treatment group along those characteristics. However, the extent to which individuals are interested in receiving program services, and whether this interest is related to outcomes, are typically not well understood. In these situations, propensityscore methods could lead to biased impact estimates because it is only when all characteristics related to both treatment status and outcomes are observed that the method ensures that impact estimates are unbiased.\nThis study explores the general applicability of propensityscore methods by addressing the following questions:\n\u2022 How well do propensity-score methods replicate experimental impacts of dropout prevention programs on four student outcomes-dropping out, educational aspirations, self-esteem, and absenteeism? \u2022 How well do propensity-score methods replicate experimental impacts when based on limited information commonly available from public-use data sets, rather than from more extensive data sets? \u2022 How precise (in terms of standard errors) are impact estimates based on propensity-score methods-an issue not considered in previous applications of propensity-score matching?\nThree main findings emerge from this study. First, we find no consistent evidence that propensity-score methods replicate experimental impacts of the dropout prevention programs examined in this study. Among the programs for which we could identify a comparison group that is well matched to its treatment group, there are only scattered instances in which the experimental and propensity-score impacts are similar. This finding holds true for propensity-score impacts based on extensive data, as well as for impacts based on less-extensive data to which researchers are likely to have access.\nSecond, our findings suggest that propensity-score methods can replicate standard errors of experimental impacts. Moreover, they can be approximated well using the standard analytic formula. We used bootstrap methods to assess how well the standard analytic formula estimates the complex variances that arise when matching methods are used.\nThird, comparison group designs based on propensityscore matching may not always be feasible, as sometimes is the case with experimental designs. Our goal was to select two well-matched comparison groups for each of the sixteen treatment groups for which we had data, where one set was selected from a sample of students that is similar to the treatment groups along many important characteristics, and the other set from a nationally representative sample of students. However, our attempts to identify comparison groups that satisfied statistical tests of equivalence failed in a number of cases, even when the selection was based on the sample of students that is similar to the treatment groups. The difficulty can be traced to combinations of certain characteristics among treatment group members that were rare among the samples of students from which we selected comparison groups. We did not compute propensity-score impacts in those cases, as the comparison groups violated one of the two conditions that Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) showed must hold if a comparison group is to produce unbiased impact estimates. This finding suggests that, even when efforts to select a comparison group are based on a sample of students that appears to be quite similar to the treatment group, propensity-score methods do not always yield an adequate comparison group.\nThe remainder of this article is organized in the following way. Section II describes previous evidence on the validity of comparison group designs for measuring program impacts, including evidence about the propensity-score method. Section III outlines the goals of this study and describes the data used for the analysis. Section IV describes how propensity-score matching was used to select comparison groups, and section V reports on the similarity of the treatment and selected comparison groups. Section VI discusses the methods used to estimate impacts and standard errors. Sections VII and VIII present our results and conclusions, respectively."}, {"section_title": "II. Previous Evidence on the Validity of Comparison Group Designs", "text": "A popular approach for estimating the impact of a program on its participants is to compare the outcomes of participants and the outcomes of individuals who are similar to participants but who did not participate in the program (a comparison group). Essentially, this evaluation design uses outcomes of the comparison group as an estimate of the outcomes that participants would have experienced had they not participated in the program (hereafter, the counterfactual).\nComparison group designs resolve some-but not all-of the issues involved in measuring the counterfactual. The key unresolved issue is whether members of the comparison group are similar to participants along all factors (both observed and unobserved) that affect outcomes. The possibility of dissimilarity means that measured differences in outcomes between participants and the comparison group may consist of both program impacts and the influence of other factors.\nExperimental designs resolve the dissimilarity problem by randomly assigning individuals who are eligible to participate in a program to one of two groups. The first group (the treatment group) is allowed to participate in the program, whereas the second group (the control group) is not. Experiments are appealing because they yield the ideal comparison group-a group that is similar to the program group along both observed factors and unobserved factors.\nThe theoretical superiority of experimental designs over comparison group designs does not mean that the latter necessarily gives false or misleading answers in practice. If unobserved factors do not influence outcomes much, or if similar comparison groups can be readily identified, then comparison group designs may well yield results that are similar to results obtained from experimental designs. Furthermore, mounting an experiment presents its own challenges, including the need to address the perceived ethical problem of not offering services to control group members, the need to ensure that programs have adequate numbers of applicants to create control groups without leaving program slots vacant, the cost of monitoring to ensure that the integrity of the experiment is maintained, and the need to understand how the effect of an intervention on program entry affects the observed impacts (Heckman, 1992; Moffitt, 1992) . If comparison group designs produce results that come close enough to those based on experimental designs, then the costs of mounting experiments could well outweigh their theoretical superiority.\nBeginning in the 1980s, researchers began to examine whether comparison group designs can replicate results based on experimental designs. They found that comparison group designs often yield highly misleading findings. LaLonde (1986) found that the experimental impact estimate of the National Supported Work demonstration (NSW) on earnings was approximately $1,800, whereas comparison group estimates ranged widely from \u03ea$15,000 to $1,000. Studies by Fraker and Maynard (1987) and by Friedlander and Robins (1995) , both of which examined the effect of welfare reform programs on employment rates, also found that experimental and comparison group impact estimates were strikingly different.\nUsing the same data as did LaLonde, a recent study by Dehejia and Wahba (1999) showed that a nonexperimental method not widely used by evaluators-propensity-score matching-yields impact estimates that are close to those produced by an experimental design. Propensity-score methods estimate impacts by comparing outcomes of program participants with outcomes of a select group of individuals who, on average, are similar to participants along all the characteristics that are related to the outcomes of interest (Rubin, 1973) . For the subset of NSW treatment group members that Dehejia and Wahba studied, the experimental estimate of the program's effect on earnings equaled $1,794, and the impact estimates based on various approaches to propensity-score matching were similar, ranging from $1,200 to $2,200. For one particular approach to propensityscore matching-nearest-neighbor matching, which we describe in the article and used to select comparison groupsthe propensity-score impact of $1,691 was very close to the experimental impact of $1,794.\nDehejia and Wahba's findings raise important issues about the general applicability of the propensity-score method, such as whether it can replicate experimental impacts of programs in other settings and for other outcomes. The theoretical properties of the propensity-score method ensure that, if unobservable characteristics do not influence outcomes, matching individuals based on their propensity score is equivalent to using an experimental design (Rosenbaum, 1995) . If unobservable characteristics do influence outcomes, then the propensity-score method may yield different impact estimates than the ones that experimental methods would produce. However, the size of the difference depends on the extent to which program participants and the comparison group differ along unobservable characteristics. Dehejia and Wahba's results suggest that, at least for the subset of NSW treatment group members they studied, the extent to which unobservable characteristics mattered was small enough for propensity-score methods to do well in replicating experimental findings. 1"}, {"section_title": "III. The Goals of This Study and a Description of the Data Used", "text": "We explore the general applicability of propensity-score methods by comparing experimental and propensity-score impacts of dropout prevention programs on four student outcomes: (1) dropping out, (2) educational aspirations, (3) self-esteem, and (4) absenteeism. We compute propensityscore impacts using both extensive data and limited information commonly available from public-use data sets. We also use bootstrap methods to estimate the standard error of propensity-score impacts; using these methods enables us to assess how well the standard analytic formula estimates the complex variances that arise when matching methods are used. The analysis is based on data collected for the federal evaluation of the School Dropout Demonstration Assistance Program (SDDAP), and on data collected on students who participated in the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS)."}, {"section_title": "A. The School Dropout Demonstration Assistance Program", "text": "The SDDAP, which operated from 1991 through 1996, funded two types of programs throughout the United States that were designed to reduce dropping out among middleschool and high-school students: (1) targeted, and (2) restructuring. The targeted programs offered services to students that were intended to help them perform better in school and stay in school. Targeted-program services included intensive instruction, monitoring of attendance, counseling and mentoring, links with social service providers, and instruction in life skills and conflict resolution. Each program established its own criteria for eligibility, including being overage for grade, having low grades or test scores, having frequent absences, having a history of disciplinary incidents, and having problems with alcohol or substance use. Some programs sought students with specific characteristics, such as having already dropped out, and encouraged the students to attend. Other programs tried to recruit students by advertising their services on posters or in fliers, or asked teachers or other school staff to refer students to them. Mostly, the programs considered the targeting criteria as general guidelines and used substantial discretion to serve students whom they judged to be in need of, or able to benefit from, their services. The decision to attend a targeted program ultimately was a combination of input by school staff, the student, and the student's parents. Simply put, the programs were largely voluntary. However, even though the programs were largely voluntary, analyses of student characteristics indicated that, based on conventional risk factors, nearly all students served by the programs were either dropouts or at risk of dropping out-that is, nearly all students met the eligibility criteria of most of the programs (Gleason & Dynarski, 1994) . The restructuring programsthe second type of dropout prevention programs funded by the SDDAP-are described below.\nThe SDDAP funded a total of 85 programs, 65 of which were established in September 1991, and the remainder in 1992. Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. selected 20 of the 65 programs funded in September 1991 to participate in the federal evaluation of the SDDAP; 16 of the 20 were targeted programs, and 4 were restructuring programs. Selected programs were those that were willing to have the evaluation conduct random assignment, and that served enough students to generate sample sizes that were large enough to detect policy-relevant impacts.\nThe targeted programs were evaluated using an experimental design, whereas the restructuring programs were 1 Smith and Todd (2000) concluded that unobservable characteristics did not matter much in the study by Dehejia and Wahba because the analysis by those authors was based on a sample that was much smaller than LaLonde's original sample. In particular, Dehejia and Wahba included in their sample only individuals who were randomized later in the NSW program intake period, if they had no earnings during the second year before randomization. In fact, Smith and Todd showed that propensityscore methods do not replicate experimental impacts when the individuals that Dehejia and Wahba excluded are included in the analysis. evaluated using a comparison group design. For each targeted program, the experimental design essentially involved comparing outcomes of two random samples of students who applied to or, in some cases, were referred to the program, where one of the samples (the treatment group) was offered services, and the other sample (the control group) was not. More details about the comparison group design used to evaluate the restructuring programs are provided below."}, {"section_title": "B. Treatment Groups", "text": "The treatment groups used in this study include students who were randomly assigned to the sixteen targeted SDDAP programs, of which eight were middle-school programs and the other eight were high-school programs. 2 As mentioned above, treatment group members were either dropouts or at risk of dropping out, and applied or were referred to a targeted program. The treatment groups ranged in size from 77 to 393. The SDDAP evaluation randomly assigned approximately half of the treatment group members in the fall of 1992, and the other half in the fall of 1993.\nThe SDDAP evaluation collected baseline and follow-up data for all treatment group members. Three annual followups were conducted for the 1992 cohort; two annual followups were conducted for the 1993 cohort. In this study, we analyze outcomes of treatment group members two years after baseline, because that information is available for both cohorts.\nThe SDDAP evaluation collected baseline and follow-up data from school records and questionnaires. The school records data included 8 items, and the questionnaire data included more than 150 items. Together, the two data sources provide extensive information about each student's characteristics and outcomes at baseline, as well as how those characteristics and outcomes changed during each subsequent follow-up period."}, {"section_title": "C. Comparison Groups", "text": "Our goal was to select two comparison groups for each of the 16 treatment groups. The first set of comparison groups was selected from the sample of students who attended the comparison schools used to evaluate the SDDAP restructuring programs; the second set was selected from the sample of students who participated in the NELS. This section describes the two samples of students from which comparison groups were selected. It also discusses the advantages and disadvantages of selecting comparison groups from each sample."}, {"section_title": "SDDAP Comparison School Students:", "text": "Unlike the targeted programs (which offered services to students who were interested in the program), the restructuring programs provided services and structures designed to affect all students in a school, thereby ultimately lowering the school's dropout rate. The services and structures were intended to be comprehensive and included new curriculum approaches, changes in school governance, expanded teacher training and development, and expanded health and social services. Analyses of student characteristics showed that the schools offering restructuring programs generally were those with significant numbers of at-risk students, which was one of the criteria for receiving a restructuring program grant (Gleason & Dynarski, 1995) . However, students did not have to be dropouts or at risk of dropping out to be included in the study sample (as were nearly all the students served by the targeted programs). For the SDDAP evaluation, most students in the restructuring middle schools were sampled randomly from lists of seventh graders, whereas most students in the restructuring high schools were sampled from lists of tenth graders. Ninth graders were sampled for one of the restructuring schools because the restructuring effort there focused on the ninth grade.\nWe selected the first set of comparison groups from students who attended the comparison schools used to evaluate the SDDAP restructuring programs. As mentioned above, the SDDAP evaluation used a comparison group design to evaluate the restructuring programs. Essentially, the design involved comparing outcomes of two random samples of students, where one sample attended a school that operated a restructuring program, and the other attended similar schools that were in the same district, but that did not operate restructuring programs (hereafter, comparison schools). Four restructuring programs were included in the SDDAP evaluation, with one comparison school selected for each restructuring school. 3 For this study, we selected the first set of comparison groups from the pooled sample of SDDAP comparison school students. The pooled sample contains approximately 3,000 students. Outcomes of these students were measured two years after baseline, which is consistent with the point at which outcomes were measured for treatment group members.\nThere are two advantages of selecting comparison groups from this sample of students. First, by design, these students were at risk of dropping out, and they attended schools where many students were at risk of dropping out. Second, the same school records and questionnaire data collected for the treatment groups also were collected for students who attended the SDDAP comparison schools. Therefore, this sample contains many students who met the eligibility criteria met by the treatment groups, and can be further matched to the treatment groups using the same extensive information that was collected for the treatment groups.\nA potential disadvantage of selecting comparison groups from SDDAP comparison school students is that they did not attend schools in the same district as the schools attended by treatment group members. SDDAP students attended school in Dallas, Texas; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Phoenix, Arizona; and Santa Ana, California. None of the treatment group students attended school in those cities."}, {"section_title": "NELS Students:", "text": "We selected the second set of comparison groups from students who participated in the NELS. The base-year survey of the NELS was conducted in 1988 and consisted of a nationally representative sample of eighth graders. 4 Follow-up surveys were conducted in 1990, 1992, 1994, and 2000 . While the respondents were of school age (at the time of the 1988, 1990, and 1992 surveys), information was collected from the students, one of their parents, two of their teachers, and their schools' administrator. Some school-aged respondents were not attending school at the time of the 1990 and 1992 surveys because they had dropped out. To understand their reasons for dropping out, the 1990 and 1992 surveys collected information about dropping out from those respondents. After respondents should have graduated from high school (at the time of the 1994 and 2000 surveys), information was collected only from respondents who had been students and not from others who had been previously surveyed, such as parents. High school transcripts of respondents also were collected.\nThe NELS sample that we used in our study includes students who participated in the 1988 survey and students who participated in the 1990 survey. Taken together, this sample contains approximately 28,000 students. 5 However, it is not a sample of 28,000 individual students; instead, it counts many students twice, because many students participated in both the 1988 and 1990 surveys, and participation in both surveys was the criterion we used to define our NELS sample. We included students twice because whether one of these students is a suitable comparison group member may depend on the point in time at which we measure his or her characteristics. 6 As was the case for SDDAP students, outcomes of NELS students were measured two years after baseline, which is consistent with the point at which outcomes were measured for treatment group members.\nThere are two advantages of selecting comparison groups from this sample of students. First, it is a public-use sample of students who attended school at roughly the same time as did the students in the treatment groups, and researchers who do not have access to primary data may use data of this type to evaluate education programs, such as those funded by the SDDAP. Second, although this sample does not contain enough students who attended schools in the same districts as the treatment groups to conduct matching at the district level, it does contain enough students who attended schools in areas that are similar according to level of urbanicity. 7 Therefore, these data allow us to use schoollocation characteristics in the matching process-something that is not possible with SDDAP comparison school students.\nA potential disadvantage of selecting comparison groups from the NELS is that we cannot use all the characteristics that are available for the treatment groups in the matching process. By design, the questionnaire administered to the treatment groups by the SDDAP evaluation contained many of the same items as were in the NELS questionnaire. However, the former contained some characteristics that the latter did not."}, {"section_title": "IV. How Comparison Groups Were Selected", "text": "A straightforward way to select a comparison group is to identify, from a sample of potential comparison group members, an individual that is identical to each treatment group member along each characteristic that affects the outcomes of interest, but who was not offered the treatment. The problem with this approach is that the sample of potential comparison group members may not contain enough individuals to produce an exact match for every treatment group member. However, that sample may contain all the individuals needed to select a comparison group that is similar to the treatment group, on average. The problem then is how to select such a group. Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) showed that, when many characteristics are used in the matching process, propensity scores can be used to select a comparison group that is similar, on average, to a treatment group along those characteristics. The propensity score is a single number that indicates the extent to which one person is similar to another along a collection of observed characteristics."}, {"section_title": "A. Propensity-Score Matching", "text": "We used propensity scores to select comparison groups for each treatment group, according to the following three steps. First, a logit model was estimated separately for each dropout prevention program, where a binary variable that equals 1 for treatment group members and 0 for potential comparison group members was regressed on variables that represent individual characteristics. The characteristics included in the logit model are described below.\nSecond, a propensity score was assigned to each treatment group member and each potential comparison group member. The propensity score for each individual equals the weighted sum of the individual's values for the characteristics included in the logit model, where the weights are the parameter estimates of the logit model.\nThird, for each treatment group member, the potential comparison group member with the closest absolute propensity score-the nearest neighbor-was selected. The selection process was done with replacement, so that a potential comparison group member could have been matched to more than one treatment group member. 8"}, {"section_title": "B. Tests Used to Assess the Similarity of the Treatment and Comparison Groups", "text": "In addition to showing the usefulness of propensity scores for selecting comparison groups, Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) also showed that a comparison group selected using propensity scores could be used to produce unbiased impact estimates if two conditions are satisfied: (1) all the characteristics that are related to both treatment status and outcomes are observed, and (2) treatment and comparison group members with similar propensity scores are similar along those characteristics. The second condition means that the logit model must produce an estimate of the propensity score such that, at each value of the estimated propensity score, the characteristics of treatment and comparison group members with those values are similar.\nWe tested whether the comparison groups satisfy the first condition by comparing experimental and propensity-score impacts for each dropout prevention program. If the two impact estimates for a particular program are similar, we concluded that the program's comparison group satisfies the first condition.\nBefore comparing the two sets of impact estimates, however, we first tested whether each comparison group satisfied the second condition. The combined sample of treatment and comparison group members for a particular program was first ranked according to its propensity scores. Individuals were then divided into strata, where each stratum contained a sample size adequate to detect any meaningful differences in the characteristics of treatment and comparison group members. In particular, we divided individuals into strata that contained approximately 150 individuals in each stratum, of whom 75 were treatment group members and 75 were comparison group members. Within each stratum, two statistical tests were conducted. The first was a t-test of the similarity of the average propensity score across treatment and comparison group members. The second was an F-test of the similarity of the collection of characteristics across treatment and comparison group members. If both the t-test and the F-test within each stratum failed to detect a difference at the 0.05 level of significance, we concluded that the comparison group is well matched to the treatment group along observed characteristics-that is, we concluded that Rosenbaum and Rubin's (1983) second condition had been satisfied. If any test within any stratum detected a difference, we respecified the logit model by adding higher-order and/or interaction terms, and reselected a comparison group until all the statistical tests failed to detect a difference. 9 If none of the logit model specifications that we tried for a particular dropout prevention program yielded a well-matched comparison group, we did not estimate impacts for that program, as the comparison group violated one of the two conditions that Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) showed must hold to produce unbiased impact estimates using propensity-score methods."}, {"section_title": "C. Characteristics Used in the Matching Process", "text": "Our goal was to select comparison groups that are well matched to their respective treatment groups along all the characteristics that affect the outcomes for which we compute impacts. Conducting the selection process in this way ensures that the comparison groups experience the outcomes their respective treatment groups would have experienced had they not been exposed to program services. Put differently, it would ensure that the outcomes of the com- 8 In previous work, we also selected (for each treatment group) a comparison group that included all potential comparison group members whose propensity score fell between the minimum and maximum values of the treatment group's propensity-score distribution (Agodini & Dynarski, 2000) . Impacts based on these comparison groups were computed as the difference in the average outcome between the treatment and comparison group members within each stratum; we then computed the weighted average of these impacts, where the weight for each within-stratum impact equaled the number of treatment group members in the stratum. The strata were defined as described below. Results based on these comparison groups were similar to those based on the nearest-neighbor comparison groups. This finding is consistent with work by Smith and Todd (2000) , who found that propensity-score impacts are not sensitive to the ways in which matching is often conducted. 9 Many previous studies divided individuals into strata based on the value of the propensity score (Cochran, 1968; Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983; Dehejia & Wahba, 1999) , instead of the propensity score rank, as we did. For example, many studies divided individuals into five strata, with score values 0.0-0.2, 0.2-0.4, . . . , 0.8-1.0. We did not use this approach to group individuals, because the estimated propensity score often was more tightly clustered, as happens, for example, when a comparison group is selected from a sample that already is similar (on average) to the treatment group. Therefore, if we had defined the strata in the way in which several previous studies did, all individuals might have been placed in one stratum. Our approach divides individuals into strata based on their propensity-score rank, so that (as described above) each stratum contains an adequate sample size to detect any meaningful differences in the characteristics of treatment and comparison group members. Provided there are enough individuals to support statistical tests in more than one stratum, our approach always will group individuals into more than one stratum. Our approach preserves the advantages of stratification in situations where the distribution of the estimated propensity score has a small variance.\nparison groups are a reliable estimate of the counterfactual for their respective treatment groups.\nOur approach for meeting this goal was to include in the matching process: (1) characteristics used to determine program eligibility, (2) baseline values of the outcomes for which we compute impacts, and (3) characteristics that the literature indicates are related to the baseline dropout status of our treatment groups. The idea behind the third component is that we wanted to include characteristics related to dropping out among the students for whom we are selecting comparison groups-that is, for our treatment groups. We also wanted to include characteristics related to dropping out before the treatment groups were exposed to program services-that is, at baseline.\nTo determine which characteristics are related to dropping out among the treatment groups, we used a regression model to analyze the dropout status of the treatment groups at baseline. We also analyzed baseline values of the three other outcomes for which we compute impacts-educational aspirations, self-esteem, and absenteeism. The models included characteristics that the literature indicates are related to dropping out, and that are available for our treatment groups. 10 The models also included several characteristics that the literature does not indicate are related to dropping out, but that we thought might be related and therefore would be important to use in the matching process. For example, the models included the extent to which the treatment groups participated in extracurricular activities. We included this characteristic because it might be correlated with the extent to which students feel a sense of belonging to their schools, which, in turn, might discourage dropping out. Table 1 reports the 32 characteristics included in the regression model, and the ones among the 32 that are related to at least one of the baseline outcomes of the treatment groups. 11 The results are reported separately for the pooled middle-school treatment groups and the pooled high-school treatment groups. 12 Characteristics that are related to at least one of the baseline outcomes of either the middle-school or high-school treatment groups also are reported.\nThe results indicate that 27 of the 32 characteristics are related to at least one of the baseline outcomes of either the middle-school or high-school treatment groups. The related characteristics include baseline values of the outcomes for which we compute impacts, many student characteristics, and a few school and neighborhood characteristics.\nConsistent with our goal, we wanted to include in the logit model used to estimate propensity scores all 27 of the related characteristics plus 1 other characteristic that was not related-overage for grade. We wanted to include the latter because it was one of the main criteria that the dropout prevention programs used to determine whether a student was eligible for services.\nFor a number of reasons, we could not include for any program all 28 characteristics in the logit model. First, as we mentioned above, some of the characteristics-including absenteeism, reading test scores, and math test scoreswere not available for some of the treatment groups or for 10 Characteristics that the literature indicates are related to dropping out, but that we did not include in the regression models either because they were not available for the treatment groups or because they had a high proportion of missing values, include curricular track, income, having to care for a child, employment status, and measures of socioeconomic status other than mother's education, religiosity, and neighborhood socioeconomic status.\n11 Four of the characteristics included in the regression models are baseline values of the outcomes for which we compute impacts. When analyzing the baseline value of a particular outcome, we included in the analysis baseline values of the other three outcomes.\n12 Some of the characteristics were not available for some of the treatment groups. For example, absenteeism, reading test scores, and math test scores were not available for some of the treatment groups, mostly due to their unavailability in school records. SDDAP students, mostly due to their unavailability in school records. Similarly, several characteristics were not available for NELS students, including math and reading test scores, time spent reading for fun, whether a sibling had dropped out, participation in extracurricular activities, discipline problems, and absenteeism. 13 Second, we sometimes did not include school urbanicity in the matching process based on SDDAP students; however, in these cases, the matching process generally selected students that also were in urban areas, though the areas may have been larger or smaller than the area where the treatment group was located. For example, the SDDAP sample did not contain students in the same Common Core of Data urbanicity category as Albuquerque's treatment group-a mid-size central city. However, for this treatment group, the matching method chose 74% of Albuquerque's comparison students from schools in a large central city and 26% from schools in an urban fringe of a mid-size city. 14 Third, even all the available characteristics for a particular program sometimes could not be included in the logit model because several of them were highly correlated. For example, variables that represent whether a student \"ever dropped out\" and his or her \"baseline dropout status\" were sometimes highly correlated. Therefore, parameter estimates of the logit model would suffer from collinearity problems, which, in turn, would produce unreliable estimates of the propensity score.\nTo address the third issue, for each program, we estimated the logit model using variables that were not correlated and then checked (within each stratum) the full set of variables for balance across the treatment and comparison groups. This procedure addresses the collinearity issue while ensuring that the comparison groups are well matched to their respective treatment groups along all the characteristics that were available for each program. Figure 1 summarizes the process we used to select comparison groups. It is worth noting that the process makes no use of outcome information. We know, within some degree of statistical precision, the \"right\" impacts-that is, the experimental impacts for each of the dropout prevention programs. This makes it possible, at least in theory, to search for a comparison group that replicates the experimental impacts. However, such a search process would be of no help in designing an evaluation, for the sample would need to be identified before outcomes were observed. Rubin (2001) emphasizes the importance of maintaining the integrity of the design in this way."}, {"section_title": "D. Summary", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "V. Similarity of the Treatment and Comparison Groups", "text": "As mentioned above, our goal was to select, for each of the sixteen treatment groups, two well-matched comparison groups: one from SDDAP students and the other from NELS students. A comparison group is well matched to a treatment group if (within each stratum) the estimated propensity score and the collection of available characteristics is not significantly different across the two groups.\nOur attempts to identify comparison groups that satisfied the within-stratum equivalence failed for a number of cases. The difficulty was that some of the treatment groups have combinations of certain characteristics that are rarely represented among SDDAP and NELS students. For example, some of the treatment groups have a high percentage of students that are overage for grade and young-that is, a high percentage that have been left back at an early age. There are a reasonable number of SDDAP and NELS students that are overage for grade. However, SDDAP and NELS students tend to have been left back at a later age than these treatment groups. We did not estimate impacts for programs where a well-matched comparison group could not be identified because the comparison group violated one of the two conditions that Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) 13 Some of the characteristics are available for NELS students, but were not obtained in the same way for the treatment groups. For example, math and reading test scores are available for NELS students, but the math and reading tests administered to NELS students were different from those administered to the treatment groups.\n14 This was not an issue for NELS students, because there were a significant number who attended school in each type of area where the treatment groups attended school. showed must hold to produce unbiased impact estimates using propensity-score methods. The appendix provides more details about the process we followed to identify comparison groups.\nIn the end, we could only identify a well-matched comparison group for six of the sixteen treatment groups. For two of the six (Albuquerque and Miami), we were able to identify a well-matched comparison group from both SDDAP and NELS students. For the other four (Atlanta, Flint, Chicago, and Sweetwater), we were able to identify only one well-matched comparison group, either from SD-DAP or from NELS students. Tables 2 and 3 report the characteristics that were available to assess the similarity of each of the six treatment groups and their SDDAP and NELS comparison groups. A maximum of 20 characteristics were available for the SDDAP comparison groups. However, only the SDDAP comparison group for the Chicago treatment group could be selected using all twenty characteristics; the rest were selected using between fifteen and eighteen characteristics. In contrast, a maximum of thirteen characteristics were available for the NELS comparison groups. However, only the NELS comparison group for the Miami treatment group could be selected using all thirteen characteristics; the rest were selected using eleven characteristics. 15 Table 4 reports the results of within-stratum statistical tests for the six treatment groups where a well-matched comparison group could be identified. The tests include a t-test of the similarity of the estimated propensity score across the treatment and comparison groups, and an F-test of the similarity of the collection of available characteristics across the treatment and comparison groups. The tests were conducted within strata, where the strata were defined as described above. If the estimated p-value for each of the tests within each stratum is more than 0.05, we assume that the comparison group is well matched to its treatment group.\nThe results indicate that the comparison groups are well matched to their treatment groups. For example, the numbers of treatment and comparison group members in the Albuquerque program were large enough to divide them * The number of comparison group members is unweighted-that is, it does not take into consideration the number of times a comparison group member was matched to a treatment group member.

Within each stratum, the average value of the propensity score across the treatment and comparison groups is not significantly different, nor is the collection of available characteristics.\nTo further demonstrate that well-matched comparison groups have been selected, table 5 reports statistics on the similarity of the collection of available characteristics across each treatment group and up to three groups. The first group is the control group used for the experimental evaluation of the programs. The second and third groups are the SDDAP and NELS comparison groups, respectively. The statistics in the table are estimated p-values from F-tests of the similarity of the collection of available characteristics across the treatment and control/comparison groups. A pvalue of 0.05 or less indicates that the collection of characteristics for a treatment and control/comparison group differs at conventional levels of statistical significance. Tables that report the similarity of the treatment and control/ comparison groups along each characteristic are available upon request. 16 The results indicate that the treatment and comparison groups are similar along the collection of available characteristics. In fact, for some treatment groups, the comparison groups are more similar along the characteristics than the control groups. For example, the characteristics of the treatment and control groups for the Flint and Chicago programs are significantly different, whereas the characteristics of the treatment and comparison groups for these programs are not significantly different. 17"}, {"section_title": "VI. Methods Used to Estimate Impacts and Standard Errors", "text": "Experimental impacts were estimated as the difference in average outcomes between the treatment and the control group. Propensity-score impacts were estimated in a similar way, using comparison groups instead of control groups. We also computed both experimental and propensity-score impacts using the method of difference in differences-that is, the difference in average outcomes between the treatment and control/comparison group, minus any difference in average outcomes that existed between these two groups at baseline. We computed these impacts, as Rubin and Thomas (2000) suggest, to adjust for any baseline differences that, 16 To establish the differences of the potential comparison groups at the outset, we also examined the similarity between each treatment group and a comparison group that included a random sample (equal in size to the treatment group) from all SDDAP students, and one from all NELS students. In all cases, the collection of characteristics was significantly different across these unmatched comparison groups and their treatment groups. 17 The finding that the characteristics of the treatment and control groups are significantly different for the Flint and Chicago programs suggests that there may have been problems with random assignment for these two programs. However, examination of a larger number of baseline characteristics indicated that most differences between the treatment and control groups for these programs were not significantly different, suggesting there were no problems with random assignment for the Flint and Chicago programs. Perhaps more importantly, using regression methods to adjust for the Flint and Chicago treatment-control group differences when computing experimental impacts does not affect our conclusions about the propensity-score method's ability to replicate experimental impacts for these programs. Note: Statistics equal the estimated p-value from an F-test of the similarity of the collection of available characteristics across the treatment and control/comparison groups.

Our findings are similar, whether based on the simple or difference-in-differences impact estimates. Therefore, we report only the simple impacts.\nStandard errors for experimental impacts were computed using the standard analytic formula, whereas standard errors for propensity-score impacts were computed using the bootstrap method, which acknowledged the complex way in which these impacts are computed. 18 Using the bootstrap method to compute standard errors for propensity-score impacts involved replicating the entire process used to compute the impacts, including selecting a comparison group for each of the bootstrap replicates. Our bootstrap standard errors are based on 1,000 replications, because in other work we have done we found that bootstrap standard errors for complex statistics did not stabilize until the number of bootstrap replications approached 1,000. However, to compute these standard errors more economically, we assumed that the specification of the logit model developed using the original sample was appropriate for each bootstrap sample (hereafter, fixed logit model standard errors). 19 For comparison purposes, we also computed standard errors for propensity-score impacts using the standard analytic formula (hereafter, random sample standard errors)."}, {"section_title": "VII. Results", "text": "Before we present the results, it is important that we describe the criteria we used to determine whether propensity-score methods replicate experimental impacts. In our setting, a program that had a negative impact is (what most would consider to be) an effective program, because the program decreased a negative outcome. For example, a negative impact on the percentage of students that dropped out means that the program increased the percentage of students that either graduated or were still attending high school. An effective program also is the type of program that policymakers are likely to use as a benchmark when deciding to fund other, similar programs. Therefore, we focus on the propensity-score method's ability to detect programs that experimental methods indicated were effective. We also focus on cases where experimental methods indicate that a program was ineffective (that is, either had no impact or a positive one), but propensity-score methods indicate that the program was effective, as these are situations in which propensity-score methods may lead policy makers to the wrong decision about whether to fund other, similar programs. Table 6 reports experimental and propensity-score impacts on the percentage dropped out for the six dropout prevention programs where we could identify a comparison group that is well matched to its treatment group. The proportion of treatment group members who dropped out is also reported. The results are grouped by middle-school and high-school programs."}, {"section_title": "A. Impacts", "text": "The results do not provide consistent evidence that propensity-score methods replicate experimental impacts of dropout prevention programs. The experimental results indicate that two of the six programs-Atlanta and Flintwere effective at reducing dropping out. Well-matched comparison groups for these programs could be identified only from SDDAP students. Had these programs been evaluated using propensity-score methods based on SDDAP students, neither the effectiveness of the Atlanta program nor that of the Flint program would have been detected. The experimental impacts indicate that the Atlanta and Flint programs reduced dropping out by 11.4 and 9.5 percentage points, respectively. The SDDAP propensity-score impacts also indicate that these programs reduced dropping out; however, unlike the experimental impacts, the SDDAP propensity-score impacts are not statistically significant, even at the 0.10 level. In contrast, policy decisions about the other four programs (Albuquerque, Sweetwater, Chicago, and Miami) would probably have been the same, whether based on experimental or propensity score impacts, because both types of impacts indicate that these programs were ineffective at reducing dropping out. For example, the experimental impact indicates that the Sweetwater program had no effect on dropping out, whereas the NELS propensity- Source: Authors' calculations based on data collected for the federal evaluation of the School Dropout Demonstration Assistance Program and for the National Education Longitudinal Study.\nNote: Statistics were computed using weights, where the weight for each treatment group member equals 1 and the weight for comparison group members equals the number of times the member was matched to a treatment group member.\n-No well-matched comparison group could be identified. * Significantly different from 0 at the .10 level, two-tailed test. ** Significantly different from 0 at the .05 level, two-tailed test. *** Significantly different from 0 at the .01 level, two-tailed test.\nscore impact indicates that this program increased dropping out. Although these experimental and propensity-score impacts are inconsistent, they both indicate that the Sweetwater program was ineffective at reducing dropping out.\nResults for the other three outcomes we analyzededucational aspirations, self-esteem, and absenteeism-further support the finding of no consistent evidence that propensity-score methods replicate experimental impacts in our setting (tables A1 through A3 in the appendix). For example, the experimental impacts indicate that only the Atlanta program was effective at increasing educational aspirations-that is, it reduced by 15.7 points the percentage of students expecting to complete high school or less (table  A1) . In contrast, the SDDAP propensity-score impact for the Atlanta program indicates that it had no effect (a statistically insignificant 13.4-point decrease) on educational aspirations. Inferences about the effectiveness of another program where a well-matched comparison group could be identified from SDDAP students-Flint-also would have been different. The experimental impact indicates that the Flint program had no effect on educational aspirations, whereas the SDDAP propensity-score impact indicates that it was highly effective at increasing educational aspirations. Perhaps more strikingly, inferences about the effectiveness of all three programs where well-matched comparison groups could be identified from NELS students-Albuquerque, Sweetwater, and Miami-would have been different. The experimental impacts indicate that these programs had no effect on educational aspirations, whereas the NELS propensity-score impacts indicate that they were highly effective at increasing educational aspirations.\nThe results taken together suggest that, even though the data we used to select comparison groups are extensive by most standards, the comparison groups differ from their treatment groups in important ways that we do not observe. As mentioned above, a key assumption of propensity-score methods is that all characteristics related to both treatment status and outcomes are observed. The SDDAP and NELS comparison groups may not satisfy this condition, because we do not observe, for example, the extent to which students were interested in receiving program services-a characteristic that may affect both treatment status and the outcomes we analyzed. Our finding that propensity-score methods do not consistently replicate experimental impacts suggests that the comparison groups differ from their treatment groups in ways that we do not observe that are also related to outcomes.\nAn interesting issue is whether the direction of the bias in the propensity-score impacts is consistent-that is, whether the propensity-score impacts always overestimate or always underestimate program effects in our setting. This information would help evaluators who plan to evaluate future dropout prevention programs using propensity-score methods understand whether their results overestimate or underestimate program effects.\nIn our setting, the direction of the bias in the propensity score impacts is inconsistent. For example, consider the impacts of the Sweetwater program on educational aspirations (table A1) . The experimental impact indicates that the program had no effect on educational aspirations, whereas the propensity-score impact indicates that it increased educational aspirations-that is, it reduced the percentage of students expecting to complete only high school or less. This indicates that the propensity-score impacts overestimate the effect of the Sweetwater program. One possible explanation for this finding is that the treatment group is more motivated to succeed in school-a characteristic we do not observe-than the comparison group. In contrast, the experimental impact indicates that the Sweetwater program had no effect on dropping out (table 6), whereas the propensity-score impact indicates that it increased dropping out. This indicates that the propensity-score impacts underestimate the effect of the Sweetwater program. It suggests that the treatment group differs from the comparison group in ways that make its members more likely to drop out, which is inconsistent with the hypothesis that the treatment group is more motivated to succeed in school.\nAnother interesting question is whether other methods that are easier to implement than propensity-score methods are capable of replicating experimental impacts in our setting. We explored this issue by using regression models to estimate impacts for each of the four outcomes we analyzed. In particular, using a treatment group and an entire sample of potential comparison group members, we regressed a variable that indicates a student's outcome on a variable that indicates whether a student is a treatment or potential comparison group member, and variables that represent the characteristics that were available for both treatment and potential comparison group members. Table 7 reports the coefficient on the treatment status variable from a regression model of dropping out, and tables A4 through A6 report similar results for each of the other three outcomes we analyzed. Results were produced for each of the treatment groups where we could identify well-matched SDDAP and NELS comparison groups. Like the results based on propensity-score methods, these results do not provide consistent evidence that regression methods replicate experimental impacts of dropout prevention programs. Regression-based impacts based on the entire sample of SDDAP students are strikingly similar to experimental impacts for dropping out and self-esteem (tables 7 and A5). However, this is not true when we examine impacts on educational aspirations and absenteeism (tables A4 and A6). Regression-based impacts based on the entire sample of NELS students are also considerably different in many cases. These results provide more support for the notion that important characteristics have been excluded from the matching process. Table 8 reports standard errors of the experimental and propensity-score impacts on the percentage dropped out, based on both the SDDAP and NELS comparison groups. Standard errors of the propensity-score impacts include the two we described above: (1) fixed logit model, and (2) random sample."}, {"section_title": "B. Standard Errors", "text": "These results indicate that the way in which standard errors of propensity-score impacts are computed does not matter much. Standard errors based on the fixed logit model and random sample assumptions are similar in many cases. 20 In fact, some of the standard errors for the propensityscore impacts are smaller than those for the experimental impacts. For example, the standard errors of the NELS propensity-score impacts for the Sweetwater program (2.1 for fixed logit model and random samples) are smaller than the experimental one (2.4). This is consistent with Rubin and Thomas (1992) , who showed that matching can reduce the variance, especially in small samples."}, {"section_title": "VIII. Conclusions", "text": "We find no consistent evidence that propensity-score methods replicate experimental impacts of the dropout prevention programs funded by the SDDAP. In fact, we find that evaluating these programs using propensity-score methods might have led to misleading inferences about the effectiveness of the programs. This is true for propensityscore impacts based on extensive data, as well as those based on less extensive data that researchers are likely to have access to. We also find that impacts based on regression methods, which are easier to implement, are not any more capable of replicating experimental impacts in this setting than are propensity-score methods.\nThe theoretical basis for propensity-score methods rests on the assumption that all the characteristics related to treatment status that are also related to outcomes are observed. This also is the case for many other nonexperimental methods, such as regression methods. The SDDAP programs targeted students who were at risk of dropping out. Our propensity-score impacts are based on extensive data that are not typically available to researchers, and that contain information that can be used to identify the types of students that were targeted by the programs. However, whether even these data contain enough information to capture the extent to which students were interested in receiving program services-a criterion that, in addition to being at risk of dropping out, may have been related to treatment status-is an open question. Our results suggest that even these data, though extensive by most standards, do not contain enough information to produce reliable propensity-score impacts of dropout prevention programs.\nThese findings suggest that evaluators need to consider carefully the process by which programs target individuals and the process by which individuals enter programs. In situations where individuals enter programs of their own volition, unobserved factors such as motivation may be exerting powerful influences on outcomes, influences not easily captured using nonexperimental methods. It would be useful to explore the propensity-score method's ability to replicate experimental results in settings where participation is more directed or mandatory, in which case unobservable factors may be less influential.

Therefore, as described in the main text, we included in the logit model the subset of available characteristics that produced a comparison group that is similar (within each stratum) to the treatment group along all the available characteristics. The main text describes how the strata were defined.\nThe subset of characteristics initially included in the logit model were those that statistical tests indicate are significantly different across treatment and all SDDAP students. A comparison group was then selected and the within-stratum statistical tests conducted-that is, within each stratum, a t-test of the similarity of the estimated propensity score across the treatment and comparison groups, and an F-test of the similarity of the collection of available characteristics across the treatment and comparison groups. If all of the within-stratum statistical tests failed to reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 level of significance, we concluded that the comparison group is well matched to the treatment group along observed characteristics. Otherwise, the logit model was respecified and the comparison group reselected until all the statistical tests failed to reject the null hypothesis.\nThe first comparison group selected from SDDAP students was based on a logit model that included the following baseline characteristics: The collection of treatment and selected comparison group members was large enough to define three strata, so the statistical tests were conducted within three strata.\nThe F-test in the third stratum rejected the null hypothesis, so the logit model needed to be respecified and the comparison group reselected. When we examined the specific characteristics that differed across treatment and comparison group members in the third stratum, we found that the age distribution was significantly different. In particular, the proportion of students that were less than 14 years old was significantly different across the treatment and comparison groups. Therefore, we added to the logit model (in addition to the continuous age variable) a variable that indicates whether the student is less than 14 years old, and reselected the comparison group based on refined logit model.\nThe F-test in the third stratum still rejected the null hypothesis, so the logit model needed to be further refined and the comparison group reselected once again. Age continued to be significantly different across treatment and comparison group members in the third stratum. However, this time, race/ethnicity, educational aspirations, extracurricular activities, and reading score also were significantly different across the two groups. We tried to achieve balance along these and all the other available characteristics by including a variable that interacts race/ethnicity with educational aspirations and, once again, reselected the comparison group.\nHowever, the F-test in the third stratum still rejected the null hypothesis. We continued to refine the logit model by adding other interaction variables, and higher-order terms for continuous variables.
