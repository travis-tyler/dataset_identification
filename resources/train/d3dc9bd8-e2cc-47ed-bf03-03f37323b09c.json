We tested the hypotheses that African ancestry and common genetic variants are associated with prolonged duration of cardiac repolarization, a central pathophysiological determinant of arrhythmia, as measured by the electrocardiographic QT interval. Methods and Results-First, individual estimates of African and European ancestry were inferred from genome-wide singlenucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data in 7 population-based cohorts of African Americans (n=12 097) and regressed on measured QT interval from ECGs. Second, imputation was performed for 2.8 million SNPs, and a genome-wide association study of QT interval was performed in 10 cohorts (n=13 105). There was no evidence of association between genetic ancestry and QT interval (P=0.94). Genome-wide significant associations (P<2.5\u00d710 -8 ) were identified with SNPs at 2 loci, upstream of the genes NOS1AP (rs12143842, P=2\u00d710 -15 ) and ATP1B1 (rs1320976, P=2\u00d710 -10 ). The most significant SNP in NOS1AP was the same as the strongest SNP previously associated with QT interval in individuals of European ancestry. Low probability values (P<10 -5 ) were observed for SNPs at several other loci previously identified in genome-wide association studies in individuals of European ancestry, including KCNQ1, KCNH2, LITAF, and PLN. Conclusions-We observed no difference in duration of cardiac repolarization with global genetic indices of African American ancestry. In addition, our genome-wide association study extends the association of polymorphisms at several loci associated with repolarization in individuals of European ancestry to include individuals of Afr.

Prolongation of the myocardial repolarization time, as measured by the electrocardiographic QT interval, confers increased risk of sudden cardiac death, 7 whereas shortening of the atrial repolarization time has been associated with atrial fibrillation. 8 Furthermore, QT interval has been shown to be highly heritable in individuals of both European 9 and African ancestry, 10 resulting from genetic determination by rare variants, common genetic variants, or both. Thus, ancestral differences in repolarization time might account for the observed pattern of ethnic differences in arrhythmia incidence. We therefore formed a consortium of African American cohorts with information on QT interval duration and genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data.

First, our derivation of ancestry from genome-wide genetic data reduced bias resulting from the ambiguity of self-reported ancestry and allowed treatment of ancestry as a continuous variable. Second, our use of multiple population-based cohorts reduced bias resulting from ethnic differences in access and utilization of health care and allowed consistency in methodology used for ascertainment and measurement of QT interval. Third, our metaanalysis of several large cohorts allowed adequate power to detect strong or modest ancestral effects. Fourth, our use of continuous ECG measurements of QT and RR intervals allowed adjustment for heart rate using regression modeling techniques, which are well known to be more stable across the entire range of QT interval than Bazett formula. 37 Thus, our findings from several large population cohorts that QT interval adjusted for major covariates is not associated with the proportion of African ancestry based on whole-genome SNP suggest that observations in the 2 previous studies might reflect chance, selection bias, measurement bias, or other confounding influences that contribute to between-race comparisons rather than within-race proportion genetic ancestry analyses.

NOS1AP-associate with QT interval in African Americans as well, with the strongest association for the same SNP upstream of NOS1AP conferring a similar QT prolongation as in previous studies (\u22483 ms per minor allele copy). Furthermore, we observed low P-values (P<10 -5 ) for SNPs at 4 additional loci previously reported in populations of European descent. These observations provide additional support for a similar genetic architecture for myocardial repolarization time in individuals of African and European ancestry. For NOS1AP and LITAF, the identical SNP showed the strongest association, whereas top SNPs near PLN, KCNQ1, and KCNH2 were correlated with top SNPs from studies in individuals of European ancestry. In contrast, the 2 SNPs upstream of ATP1B1 of genome-wide significance were not correlated with the SNP from studies in individuals of European ancestry, which itself was not associated with QT interval in African Americans. This finding could reflect ancestry-specific association signals at the locus or different degrees of LD across ancestries with a true, ungenotyped causal variant. In addition, this could also reflect the modest power to detect common variant associations of weak effect. The current study is similar in size to the QTGEN and QTSCD studies, and it is perhaps not unexpected that different equally powered studies will identify different common variants when multiple variants exist at a locus, as has now been observed in many large-scale genetic association studies. Additional studies are needed to identify the causal variants and genes. Although the most significant associations were observed with SNPs in potential regulatory regions upstream of NOS1AP and ATP1B1 (http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/), associations could be mediated by causal variants in longer-range LD blocks or located in regulatory motifs influencing more distant genes. However, NOS1AP and ATP1B1 are strong candidate genes; NOS1AP encodes a protein that may interact with neuronal nitric oxide synthase to accelerate cardiac repolarization by inhibition of L-type calcium channels, 41 whereas ATP1B1 encodes the cardiac \u03b2-subunit of the membrane-bound Na, K-ATPase that is essential in the maintenance of the myocardial resting membrane potential, for which the \u03b1-subunit is targeted by digoxin. 42"}, {"section_title": "Potential Clinical Implications", "text": "QT interval is a strong determinant of arrhythmia risk. Substantial heritability estimates (h 2 ) have been reported for QT interval in individuals of both European and African ancestry, ranging from 0.35 in individuals of European ancestry 9 to 0.41 in African Americans, 10 after adjustment for basic covariates including age, sex, and RR interval. A large proportion of QT variability has been shown to be explained by genetic factors, up to 40%, and about half of this was recently shown to be explained by common genetic variants. 43 In the present and previous studies, 15 we have shown that electrocardiographic markers of conduction and repolarization are not associated with genetic ancestry. These findings suggest that the reported ethnic differences in risk of cardiac arrhythmia GWA indicates genome-wide association; SNP, single-nucleotide polymorphism; and CAF, coded allele frequency.

Indeed, in GWA studies, we identify many of the same genetic associations with QT interval in individuals of African ancestry as have been found among individuals of European ancestry. Ancestral differences in arrhythmia risk might therefore be mediated by differences that do not impact electrophysiological properties of global repolarization or conduction.\nSingle polymorphisms have limited predictive ability individually and are unlikely to individually have clinical use. However, each novel locus can provide novel insights into pathophysiology and potentially therapeutic targets. Our analysis only found 2 genome-wide significant loci even though our sample size was similar to 2 previous studies in individuals of European ancestry, which identified 10 loci each. 32, 33 Such a discrepancy could reflect the greater heterogeneity in populations of African ancestry or that admixed populations have lower effective sample sizes if locus-specific ancestry is associated with differing LD patterns. Individuals of African ancestry have been shown to exhibit greater heterozygosity with more rare variants, lower proportion of common variants, and shorter-range LD patterns, 44, 45 resulting in lower coverage and power of GWA approaches compared with Europeanderived populations."}, {"section_title": "Strengths and Limitations", "text": "In forming a consortium of large, population-based cohort studies of African American participants, our study was well powered to detect substantial ancestral and genetic effects and allowed linear modeling of ancestry on QT interval with adjustment for major covariates. Furthermore, our use of multiple African American population cohorts collected at several different locations makes our study likely to provide a broader coverage of African American populations.\nOur study also has limitations that merit consideration. First, our results cannot rule out a smaller effect of ancestry on QT interval duration. Second, participants with extreme repolarization abnormalities may not have survived to the baseline visit of the cohorts studied. This limitation is likely to be of small impact, as participants of most cohorts were in the early middle age. Third, we did not have information on several clinical factors that are known to influence QT interval, including concurrent medications, myocardial ischemia, heart failure, and time point on the day of ECG recording, which potentially explain a large proportion of QT variation. Although such factors are unlikely to be determined by genotypic effects and thus unlikely to bias our observations, they could potentially dilute the effect of genetic associations.\nIn conclusion, our results establish that QT interval does not differ substantially by ancestry and extended the association of genetic polymorphisms at several loci including NOS1AP and ATP1B1 to populations of African ancestry. Future studies aimed at identifying mediators of excess genetic arrhythmia risk in African Americans should focus on factors other than cardiac conduction and repolarization."}, {"section_title": "Sources of Funding", "text": "The following 4 parent studies contributed parent study data, ancillary study data, and DNA samples through the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Broad Institute (N01-HC-65226) to create the Candidate Gene Association Resource genotype/phenotype database for wide dissemination to the biomedical research community.
