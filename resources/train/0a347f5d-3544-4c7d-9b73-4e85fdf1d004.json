[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In the face of recent damage incurred to coastal populations from severe storms such as Hurricanes Irene in 2011 (NOAA 2012), as well as flood risks from sea-level rise and land subsidence, conservation and restoration of coastal marsh systems have gained ground as potential solutions, especially in combination with engineered structures such as levees and sea walls (US Army Corps of Engineers 2013). While coastal marshes have long been understood to have ecological and environmental benefits (Day et al. 2007;Keddy et al. 2009), the question of the effectiveness of such natural systems in protecting coastal communities from storm surge has only recently gained traction. Among the relevant studies linking wetlands with coastal defenses have been quantifications of wave attenuation by vegetation via field studies and laboratory simulations (Augustin et al. 2009;Dean and Bender 2006;Gedan et al. 2011;Nepf 1999). These suggest an overall positive link between vegetation and attenuation of wind waves and surge waves. Shepard et al. (2011) conducted a systematic review of the literature pertaining to wave attenuation in salt marshes, reporting that vegetation produced significant reduction in wave height per unit distance of marsh, though both marsh and hydrodynamic characteristics affect wave attenuation. Resio and Westerink (2008) support the conclusion that multiple factors must be considered in assessing the effectiveness of coastal marshes, with particular attention to discrete factors impacting the hydrodynamic response, including topography and bathymetry, vegetation characteristics, and storm characteristics. Physically based numerical simulations have enhanced the understanding of the interconnectedness of these effects (Loder et al. 2009;Temmerman et al. 2012;Wamsley et al. 2010;Zhang et al. 2012) and have reinforced the importance of spatial considerations for effective surge attenuation. For instance, the numerical simulations by Wamsley et al. (2010) resulted in a range of attenuation rates derived from decreased water levels observed over varying distances of marsh (1 m per 6 km to 1 m per 25 km of continuous marsh) and concluded that spatial scales of wetlands are expected to impact attenuation capabilities. The assumption that spatial scales are an important factor in attenuation forms a primary basis for the construction of the framework presented here. Results and conclusions from laboratory testing, field studies, and numerical modeling have inspired complimentary analyses from social, management, and economic perspectives (Barbier et al. 2008;Temmerman et al. 2013). For instance, Costanza et al. (2008) evaluated the economic value of protection provided by coastal marsh systems using a regression model of major US hurricanes since 1980, linking the presence of wetlands in the hurricane swath with reduction in cost of damage. They estimated that coastal wetlands in the US provide USD 23.3 billion per year in storm protection service. Arkema et al. (2013) were among the first to target where conservation and restoration of coastal habitats are most critical on a broad scale, by developing a hazard index that incorporates the protective role of natural systems for all US shorelines to model the exposure of coastal populations. Prioritizing these natural systems for conservation and restoration from a surge reduction standpoint requires a multilayered consideration, including where such systems are most likely to be useful for reducing exposure of vulnerable infrastructure and people; where existing wetland systems afford the spatial scales needed for substantial attenuation based on current scientific knowledge; and the extent of typical inundation levels for a specific area based on historical storms. The purpose of this study was to present a framework for assessing the surge protection potential of CMS in a context that accounts for (1) incidence of storm surge inundation based on historical storms, (2) consideration of sufficient spatial scales for attenuation, and (3) the proximity of communities at risk. This framework combines high-resolution hydrodynamic modeling, geospatial characterization of coastal wetlands, and an inventory of populations and infrastructure at risk of damage from storm surge. A necessary step any application of this framework is a regional consideration of the impact and significance of uncertainties in both model results and wetland characteristics as defined in various national databases. Application of the framework presented in this study requires careful consideration of regionally varying inputs such as the characteristics of historical storms applied, wetland type, and exposure to ocean surge and population distribution. Here, we apply the framework to the Virginia (VA) Chesapeake Bay region."}, {"section_title": "Study area", "text": "The study region discussed in this analysis includes the VA mainland coastline and the VA portion of the Delmarva Peninsula (Fig. 1). It was selected due to its coastal exposure, the presence of wetlands of varying size, range of population densities, and history of hurricane impact. The mainland coast includes the three distinct peninsulas (Northern Neck, Middle Peninsula, and Southern Neck) and the more densely populated coastal areas of Portsmouth, Norfolk, and Virginia Beach. The VA portion of the Delmarva is a 124-km stretch often referred to as the Virginia Eastern Shore, bounded by Maryland to the north and the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay to the south. It includes the counties of Accomack and Northampton. The Atlantic coastline of the VA Delmarva is composed of coastal marsh systems protected to varying degrees by a barrier island chain. On the bay side of the peninsula, tidal wetlands are more dominant along the northern Tangier Sound, while a mixture of both tidal and non-tidal wetlands are present on Northampton County's Bay coastlines at elevations \\2 m above high water. On the mainland coast, areas of tidal and low-lying non-tidal wetlands are predominant in the southern portions of both Northern Neck (57 sq. km) and Middle Peninsula (164.5 sq. km), but tidal wetlands are most dominant along the Southern Neck and Virginia Beach coasts. According to the 2013 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) National Coastal Population Report, Virginia's coastal population (aggregated by county) exceeded 4.7 million in 2010 (NOAA 2013a), ranking 8th nationally. The highest density localities identified in that report include Virginia Beach, Norfolk, Hampton, and Poquoson. Ratcliff and McKee Smith (2011) specifically highlight the vulnerability of military installations in these areas of the lower Chesapeake Bay. Kleinosky et al. (2006) examined the vulnerability of the Hampton Roads region, mapping socioeconomic identifiers of vulnerability compared to flood-risk exposure zones, finding that storm surge presents a significant hazard for the region, and future development and seal-level rise will increase the risks of flooding. Fig. 1 Study area comprising the entirety of Virginia portion of the Delmarva Peninsula and the VA mainland coastline. Virginia NOAA stations used for validation of storm tide simulation data are also shown Virginia's coastline has seen notable damage from recent Mid-Atlantic storms. A total of 57 deaths were attributed to Hurricane Floyd in 1999, with damage estimated at USD 4.5-6 billion (NOAA 2000). An estimate of economic losses following Hurricane Isabel in 2003 reached USD 5 billion, $925 million in Virginia alone (NOAA 2004). Hurricane Irene devastated much of the US East Coast in 2011, with an estimated USD 6.5 billion in economic losses, and over 40 deaths. NOAA's Service Assessment for Irene noted significant storm surge damage for the Hampton Roads, VA area, and along the Delmarva Peninsula coastline (NOAA 2012). In 2012, Hurricane Sandy damage estimates exceeded $50 billion, its wide swath impacting 24 states (NOAA 2013b)."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "The proposed framework includes three primary components: (1) A coupled hydrodynamic and wave model is used to simulate the time series water surface elevations (WSE) and maximum water surface elevations (MWSE) for four historical storms, with results exported to a geospatial information systems (GIS) environment for spatial interpolation. (2) The extent of inundated wetlands is characterized based on selections of wetland sources, classifications, and spatial scale limitations. (3) A series of distance buffers are applied to represent proximity from flooded wetlands. A publicly available database of population information is used to quantify populations within that buffer. A flowchart depicting each component is provided in Figure S1 of Supplemental Materials."}, {"section_title": "Hydrodynamic modeling", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Numerical model", "text": "This framework employs the tightly coupled version of the hydrodynamic ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) model (Luettich et al. 1992;Westerink et al. 1994) and the wave model Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) to simulate hurricane storm surge inundation in the study area. SWAN is a third-generation wave model that computes random, short-crested, wind-generated waves in coastal and inland regions (Booij et al. 1999). ADCIRC is a finite-element hydrodynamic model that generates water levels and current velocities, and has been widely used for storm surge modeling in the east coast of USA and Gulf of Mexico (e.g., Bunya et al. 2010;Ferreira et al. 2014;Westerink et al. 2008). We used the two-dimensional, depth-integrated version of ADCIRC (Luettich and Westerink 2004) that solves the vertically integrated generalized wave continuity equation (GWCE) and the momentum equations, and the version of SWAN which has been converted to run on unstructured meshes (Zijlema 2010). In the coupled ADCIRC-SWAN model, detailed and validated by Dietrich et al. (2011), the two are run on the same unstructured mesh, allowing wave-circulation interactions to be resolved correctly in both models, with seamless transfer of energy from deep water to complex nearshore systems within the domain. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Region III (R3) East Coast mesh was used as the computational domain and elevation mesh, relative to NAVD88 (Forte et al. 2012). This is a 1.8-million node unstructured grid that includes increased resolution (50-2500 m) at coastal regions and inland river floodplains, and extends inland to the 15 m contour line to enable modeling of coastal flooding well inland of the shore. To reduce computational costs, this mesh was modified by removing *300,000 nodes from the Delaware Bay region of the mesh, leaving all other areas unchanged. Simulations were performed on the high-performance computing (HPC) stampede cluster at the University of Texas, provided by the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) (Towns et al. 2014). Geospatial model parameters (e.g., bottom friction) were extracted from the FEMA R3 nodal attributes, previously validated as part of FEMA's Region III Coastal Analysis and Mapping study (Hanson et al. 2013). Coastal vegetation present in wetlands is incorporated numerically in the model via wind stress and the consequent effect on momentum transfer to the water column, and via friction resistance at the sea bottom. These are accounted for in ADCIRC by a wind reduction coefficient due to surface-driven frictional drag (C D ), based on the Garratt 1977formulation, and by a quadratic bottom friction formulation, respectively. A detailed description of this methodology was provided by Westerink et al. (2008). The bottom friction formulation applied here computes a coefficient of friction (C f ) based on spatially varying values of Manning's n roughness which are parametrized from National Land Cover Database (NLCD) classifications for the entire study region."}, {"section_title": "Meteorological forcing and validation", "text": "A suit of four historical hurricanes was chosen to represent storms typical of those that have recently impacted the study area. Hurricanes Floyd (1999), Isabel 2003, Irene (2011), and Sandy (2012) cover a range of storm tracks, landfall locations, sizes, and speeds, and allow for the application of multiple inundation scenarios. Storm characteristics are summarized in Table 1, and tracks over the study area are shown in Fig. 2. The wind fields for all storm simulations were generated internally within ADCIRC using a dynamic asymmetric Holland gradient wind model (Holland 1980). Inputs to this wind model were generated based on meteorological data extracted from the National Hurricane Center (NHC) Best Track database. The parametric Holland model is embedded in ADCIRC and is internally coupled to the SWAN wave model (Dietrich et al. 2013;Mattocks and Forbes 2008;Xie et al. 2006). The NHC best track database contains hurricane track and intensity information at 6-h intervals, and ADCIRC was set to interpolate the wind input to 15-min intervals to generate meteorological forcing through the model mesh. Tidal forcing was propagated through the model domain from the ocean boundary, using seven tidal constituents (K 1 , K 2 , M 2 , N 2 , O 1 , Q 1 , S 2 ) extracted from the Le Provost database (Le Provost et al. 1994). Wind forcing for Hurricane Isabel was generated based on the Extended Best Track dataset (Demuth et al. 2006), supplemented with an estimation of radius to maximum winds (Lin et al. 2010). The maximum radial extents for Hurricane Floyd were estimated based on simple calibration using observed water levels at NOAA stations in the study area. Wind forcing for Hurricanes Irene and Sandy were directly extracted from the NHC best track dataset, as that dataset includes complete radial extent information for all storms beginning in 2004. Verified water level data from NOAA stations throughout the Chesapeake Bay was used to validate simulated water levels. In addition to the eight Virginia stations shown in Fig. 1, six additional stations covering the Maryland portion of the bay were included. For model validation, resulting time series water surface elevations and maximum water surface elevations were extracted from the model run at the NOAA monitoring stations."}, {"section_title": "Flood raster generation", "text": "Maximum water surface elevations were converted to an interpolated raster using the Arc Storm Surge toolset (Ferreira et al. 2014). Arc Storm Surge allows for the manipulation of ADCIRC inputs and outputs in a GIS environment. We used it to import mesh nodes and join them with maximum water surface elevation (MWSE) results. It has been noted by Raber and Tullis (2007) and others that traditional inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation methods have shown errors in flood mapping. Here, we use spline interpolation, controlling tension to prevent extrapolation beyond a realistic flood surface (Berenbrock et al. 2009). 3.2 Wetland characterization"}, {"section_title": "Datasets", "text": "While the numerical model represents wetlands using a parameterization of NLCD classifications (as described by Atkinson et al. 2008;Mattocks and Forbes 2008), the geospatial framework incorporates four national databases, from which the spatial extent and characterization of Chesapeake Bay wetlands chosen for this study are extracted (Table 2): 1the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI), (2) the 2011 National Land Cover Database (NLCD), (3) NOAA's 2010 Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP), and (4) NOAA's Wetland Potential (WP) database. As part of a more extensive study on the impact of different land-cover datasets incorporated in storm surge simulations for coastal bays, Ferreira et al. (2014) illustrated the breadth and impact of spatial differences when comparing wetland datasets against one other. The inclusion of multiple sources here is not meant to evaluate variations in hydrodynamic response, but aims instead to account for the inherent variability in each database's characterization of wetland types and geographic representations. Figure 3 illustrates this variability for the Hampton Roads region of Virginia. From each wetland source, classifications were chosen to best represent the majority of wetland types found on the Virginia coastline, thus forming four distinct wetland datasets for this study. For each of the four storm flood maps generated from numerical model results and each of the four wetland datasets, flooded wetlands in the study region are spatially identified in a GIS environment. The result from this step in the framework is a series of maps representing flooded wetlands for each simulated storm, and for each wetland dataset, producing a total of 16 flooded wetland maps."}, {"section_title": "Spatial Scale thresholds", "text": "In order to examine the relevance of spatial scales, as addressed by Wamsley et al. (2010), we apply a series of minimum wetland area thresholds to each map of flooded wetlands. We define a threshold here as the lower limit of square kilometer flooded wetland area. For instance, a threshold of 15 sq. km removes all flooded wetland areas less than 15 sq. km from the geospatial analysis. A series of six thresholds was included in the analysis for the VA Chesapeake Bay region: 5, 10, 15, 25, and 50 sq. km, as well as the 0 sq. km threshold case, wherein all areas of wetland are included. The threshold is a parameter that allows the incorporation of an enhanced understanding of spatial scales expected to yield effective surge attenuation for the study area in question. Based on the understanding that highly discontinuous wetlands will likely afford less protection that a continuous one (Loder et al. 2009). In this introductory application of this framework, we have used the concept of thresholds as an area-based limitation, but use of a distance-based limitation is also possible. As scientific discoveries advance in this area, the thresholds can be adjusted to more realistic values. The result from this step of the framework is a series of maps (hereafter referred to as ''threshold maps'') representing the portion of flooded wetlands above each of the six thresholds, for each simulated storm flooding, and for each wetland dataset, producing a total of 96 threshold maps."}, {"section_title": "Assessing the relevance of wetlands areas", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Buffers: characterizing proximity to storm surge", "text": "To evaluate the potential protection to populations in proximity to storm surge, the framework applies a series of inland buffers at specified distances from inundated Fig. 3 Spatial variability in the four wetland datasets, showing classifications chosen for this study area, as detailed in Table 2: wetlands. For each threshold map (as described above), a spatial buffer is used to expand the analysis area by a specified distance: 200, 400, and 600 m, to represent a reasonable range of flood protection the coastal marshes may provide to inland populations. The result from this step is a series of maps (hereafter referred to as ''buffer maps'') representing each of the three buffers applied to each threshold map, for each simulated storm, and for each wetland dataset: a total of 288 buffer maps."}, {"section_title": "Population protected", "text": "For each buffer map, a simple geospatial accounting of population within that buffer is conducted. We considered the population or infrastructure potentially protected from storm surge by coastal marshes as the population within a census block or point location of a given infrastructure that spatially intersects with the buffer maps. Population is represented by Census Block data extracted from FEMA's HAZUS Multi-Hazard (HAZUS-MH) geodatabase. HAZUS-MH is a GIS-based risk-assessment tool for estimating physical, economic, and social losses from flood, earthquake, and hurricane scenarios. We have extracted relevant information from the HAZUS-MH geodatabase for application in this framework. All census block populations in a specified buffer are defined as ''protected'' for the purposes of this study. We examined the impact of wetland dataset selection by computing the standard deviation from the mean value of population protected over the four datasets. For this study region, we have also conducted a cursory assessment of protected critical infrastructure for each buffer map, wherein the following nine types of infrastructures were selected and extracted from the same HAZUS-MH geodatabase: emergency centers, hazmat facilities, nuclear facilities, ports, care facilities, wastewater facilities, potable water facilities, airports, and schools. The full inventory of protected populations and critical infrastructure is included in Tables S1-S4 of the Supplementary Materials. Most of the discussion to follow is focused only on protected population."}, {"section_title": "Results and discussion", "text": "To demonstrate the functionality of the framework in assessing wetlands based on the criteria described, it is applied here to the Virginia Chesapeake Bay region. We first compare the storm surge model results with measured NOAA data, as well as with  Figure 4 depicts the model-generated time series water surface elevation (WSE) results for each storm, along with historical WSE data at the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel (CBBT) monitoring station. Figure 5 plots model-generated maximum water surface elevation (MWSE) results compared to MWSE's extracted from validated NOAA data, at all stations which had available data for each respective storm. Based on these results, we assess potential protection of inland population quantitatively, evaluating differences due to wetland dataset selection and application of thresholds and buffers. Finally, a spatial examination of all these selections and resulting impacts leads to localized analyses of wetland relevance for the study region."}, {"section_title": "Hydrodynamic model results", "text": "Although the FEMA R3 mesh has been previously applied and validated for Mid-Atlantic storms (Hanson et al. 2013), we have validated the numerical modeling results for the suit of storms simulated using verified data collected at various Virginia and Maryland NOAA monitoring stations in the study region. Hurricane Floyd's track, with the eye of the storm passing just over the mouth of the bay and along the Delmarva's Atlantic coast, resulted in rapid shift in wind field directions over Chesapeake Bay waters. Model MWSE results (*0.8 m) at CBBT station are consistent with results at the same station obtained by Cho et al. (2012) using unstructured 3D SELFE model. Direct comparison of MWSEs with data for all NOAA stations shows an underprediction by the model at all stations, averaging 0.4 m. As the level of detail in available input meteorological data is expected to impact accuracy of hind-cast hydrodynamic model results (Li et al. 2013), we attribute this general under-prediction to limitations of available data for this storm. Shen et al. (2006) also conducted numerical model simulations of Floyd, analyzing the storm's response in the Chesapeake Bay, noting the rapid variation in wind directions seen inside the bay as the storm traveled across the mouth of the bay and parallel to the Delmarva's Atlantic coast. The generated flood map indicates that Floyd generated a max surge in the southern portion of the bay, likely as a result of this phenomenon. Hurricane Isabel made landfall in North Carolina (NC), then moved across the eastern portion of the state in a Northeasterly direction, and continuing through central VA. In comparing model results for this storm with NOAA data at CBBT, we see an underprediction by the model at that station of *0.3 m, with MWSE generated at *1.6 m. A similar discrepancy with collected data was seen by Cho et al. (2012). Figure 5 shows greater overall scatter for the results of this storm than for the others, with a 0.51 m root mean square error (RMSE), owing to larger differences seen for Maryland stations further up the bay and outside the study area. By comparison to Floyd's track, Isabel's westerly path, and resulting adverse winds, generated its max surges in the northern part of the bay (Shen et al. 2005). For Hurricane Irene, which made landfall near Cape Lookout, NC, we see a close agreement of MWSE at CBBT (Fig. 4), as well as at other NOAA stations (Fig. 5). The average residual between model results and collected data over all stations is *0.2 m. Though this storm's path was similar to Floyd's, Irene traveled further from the Delmarva coast, the largest surges occurring on Atlantic coastlines rather than inside the bay. Irene flooding was the greatest in magnitude and extent of the four storms simulated (in all counties), as it travelled further offshore than Floyd, not allowing for the counteracting impact of up-bay and down-bay winds, as described by Shen et al. (2005) and Cho et al. (2012). Hurricane Sandy was steered northwest and made landfall northeast of Atlantic City, NJ. Its impact on Chesapeake Bay flooding is a function of its large size, with radius of maximum winds reaching 120 nm (222 km) near landfall. Model results slightly overpredicted the observed MWSE at CBBT (1.7 m) and were generally consistent with findings from a recent numerical model simulation using the National Weather Service SLOSH model (Forbes et al. 2014). The average residual for this storm was *0.05 m over all stations, with a RMSE of 0.47 m. The generated Sandy flood map indicates inundation focused on northern portions of the Delmarva and Virginia Beach Atlantic coastal areas."}, {"section_title": "Inundation of wetlands by storm surge", "text": "By way of demonstrating the spatial impact of thresholds, we discuss herein the spatial distribution of flooded wetlands falling above the 15 sq. km threshold. Further information on impact of all applied thresholds is available in the Supplemental Materials. Figure 6 gives a visual representation of the extent of storm surge flooding (a) and extent of flooded wetlands (b) common to all four storm simulations. Figure 7 plots the impact of all thresholds quantitatively for all storms. The Delmarva's Atlantic coastal marsh systems, covering both Northampton and Accomack Counties, are inundated by all four simulated storms, with minimal variation in extent of inland flooding in that region, with the exception of the Northern portions of the peninsula approaching the Delaware border.

For each 0-km threshold buffer map, average population protected over each dataset was used to compute the number of standard deviations (r) from the average for each dataset. A high level of variability in results is seen over the four datasets used, with average number of r from the mean Fig. 7 Total area of flooded wetland, with series of thresholds applied, for each storm Table 3 Effect of dataset selection on protected population: number of standard deviation uncertainties from the mean for each 0-km threshold buffer map analysis Buffer(m):  ranging from 0.04 (WP dataset) to 1.37 (NLCD), owing to variability in spatial characterization of wetlands. The WP dataset (NOAA) exhibits the lowest deviation from the average for each buffer map. We attribute this to NOAA's methodology in estimating ''likely'' coastal wetlands, based on the synthesis of multiple sources including CCAP and NWI, and others (Herold 2014). The variability/uncertainty in these results reflects the need for a thoughtful consideration of wetland size or distance as a metric in defining attenuation potential, as wetland delineations vary considerably over datasets. Figure 8 plots the results due to increasing thresholds and inland buffer distances on protected population for each storm, averaged over all wetland datasets. Floyd, the weakest storm, shows the lowest levels of protection overall. For thresholds from 0 to 15 sq. km, Fig. 8 Sensitivity of inland distance from flooded wetlands (buffers) and area thresholds, which define the lower limit of sq. km wetland area included in the analysis increasing buffer distance increased protection by an average 33 %. For 25 and 50 sq. km thresholds, the effect of increasing buffer distances was minimal, and the overall protection all buffers fell to less than 2500 people, indicating that flooded wetland areas from this storm greater than 25 sq. km are only present in low population density areas. The effects of threshold and buffer selection have similar results for Sandy. Though results from this storm show more protection for populations in proximity to smaller (\\5 sq. km) flooded wetlands, as thresholds are increased to 10 sq. km that potential protection drops to levels lower than those seen for Floyd. The effects of these two selections were also comparable between Isabel and Irene flood simulations. These two storms had similar protection results in all threshold selections. Increasing buffer distance for Irene from 400 to 600 m had a less than 10 % effect on potential protection, indicating low population density in that 200-m-wide area. Figure 9 plots percent of total protection offered by each threshold, normalized to the protection offered with no threshold (0 km) applied. The average percentage over all storms is also plotted. Examining the relative protection offered by all thresholds with respect to the zero-threshold condition, we observe that applying a threshold of 5 sq. km limits the potential protection in the study region to 3.4 % (averaged over all storms) of the population protected if all wetlands are considered. Limiting the analysis to flooded wetlands [50 sq. km further reduces that potential to only 0.12 %. Thus, we may note that application of the spatial scale limitations (thresholds) applied here greatly limits the overall relevance of larger wetland areas for Virginia's Chesapeake Bay regions, as few high population density localities are proximate to wetlands of such a spatial scale prone to storm sure flooding. As more information is known regarding appropriate thresholds for spatial scale, this framework can be repeated using a more realistic range of thresholds, to yield a more accurate representation of the range of relative protection possible.

(2011), in an extensive literature review of both field and numerical studies examining surge and wave attenuation by wetlands, illustrated the wide range of spatial scales seen to have a positive effect on attenuation. The framework here provides a cursory wide-lens look, based on historical flooding, from which a more localized analysis can be conducted."}, {"section_title": "Effect of threshold and buffer selections", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Localized analysis", "text": "To demonstrate the effect of thresholds on local-scale potential protection, we have identified localities that meet two sample criteria: containing flooded wetlands greater than 5 sq. km and having high direct population impacts from storm surge. Similar analyses could be conducted for other thresholds applied in this study, or a different series of thresholds based on improved understanding of appropriate spatial scales for attenuation. Also note that for this discussion, we have limited input data to the NOAA Wetland Potential database, and the flooding impact from Hurricane Irene alone, as it resulted in the greatest area of flooded wetlands over the study region. Four localities in the study region met the thresholds and population impact criteria: Hampton Roads, Accomack, Virginia Beach, and Gloucester. Figure 10 illustrates populations directly impacted by Hurricane Irene in each of these counties and surrounding regions, and all flooded wetland areas above the 5 sq. km threshold. The Hampton Roads region in Southern Neck (Fig. 10a) contains the highest populated census blocks in the study region, in proximity to large ([5 sq. km) wetland areas. By contrast, the flooded wetland areas in northern Accomack County (Fig. 10b), though above Fig. 10 Sample application of the 5 sq km threshold for localized analysis. Four localities were identified: a Hampton Roads, b Northern Accomack, c Virginia Beach, d Southern Neck the 5 sq. km threshold, are fairly discontinuous, and these are more predominant on the bay side of the county, where very few populations were affected by Irene flooding. Virginia Beach (Fig. 10c) contains flooded wetlands[5 sq. km that are similarly discontinuous, and of small width (\\4.5 km perpendicular to shoreline), though abutting high population density areas. This indicates support for the results of Temmerman et al. (2013), who classified cities into categories corresponding to their distance from the coast and their potential for protection by marshes and listed Virginia Beach as qualifying for protection primarily by engineered systems. The Middle Peninsula's Gloucester region (Fig. 10d) has flooded wetlands above the 5 sq. km threshold. In the lower portion of the peninsula, these are in proximity to directly impacted areas of high population density. Overall, when a 5 sq. km threshold is applied to VA's Chesapeake Bay, the interaction with coastal populations at risk from Irene-like surges is such that Hampton Roads and Gloucester could be deemed high priority with respect to potential protection. It is evident from such an exercise that the choice of threshold becomes an important factor in prioritizing localities for the incorporation of wetlands as a tool for coastal management."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and further study", "text": "Various limitations of the current iteration of this framework are noteworthy and suggest further research needs. Wetlands in the numerical model employed herein are represented via NLCD parametrization with Manning's n roughness. Furthermore, though storm surges in this study were generated from four historical hurricanes with a broad range of characteristics, exploration of the impact of other storm characteristics is possible. A future study may replicate the work done by Ferreira et al. (2014) to examine surge response under different land-cover scenarios, and different synthetic storm scenarios, and incorporate into the framework presented here. A future iteration of this framework could also incorporate wetland geometries and configurations on a finer scale than those represented in the databases included here, as well as a more refined characterization of vegetation present in coastal wetlands (regionally), such as species. Though the dissipation of wave energies and wave heights by vegetation has been well documented in laboratory and field studies, quantification of the capability of wetlands to serve as flood protection strategies against extreme storms is not fully understood (Anderson et al. 2011). The current iteration of this framework assumes that wetlands offer some level of protection to nearby populations over the selected buffer distances, and does not attempt to quantify the appropriate spatial scales for reliable attenuation of storm surge. Future work may involve bridging this gap in current knowledge by documenting wave and storm surge dissipation by wetlands during extreme wind events via field data to calibrate regional numerical models. A useful tool for such a calibration in ADCIRC is the subdomain modeling approach to evaluate model sensitivities to wetland parameterization and to evaluate the surge response with hybrid protection strategies which integrate marshes with traditional hard coastal structures."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Prioritizing marshes for conservation and restoration for surge reduction requires knowledge of where such systems are most likely to be useful for reducing exposure and protecting vulnerable people and infrastructure. In this study, we presented a methodology for assessing the relevance of the surge protection potential of coastal marshes, combining high-resolution hydrodynamic modeling, geospatial characterization of coastal wetlands, and population at risk from storm surge. We have examined the relevance of spatial scales by applying minimum inundated wetland area thresholds, removing areas falling below each threshold, and we have represented the potential for inland protection using buffer distances from flooded wetlands. For each combination of wetland database, flooded wetland area threshold, and buffer distance, we have estimated the population potentially protected. The methodology supports the evaluation of regionally based relationships between extent of inundation, wetland characterization, and population data to identify where interactions are relevant. As discussed, we do not attempt to suggest an appropriate scale of wetland depth or size, but rather emphasize that, as the growing body of research moves toward more accurate quantifications of spatial scales (and other wetland attributes such as dominant vegetation type, height, and density), it will become increasingly important for decision makers to identify locations where the use of wetlands as coastal management tools is potentially appropriate. Findings from application of this framework to the VA Chesapeake Bay region included both a quantified and spatial determination of the effect of spatial scale thresholds on potential protection of nearby populations. In examining the effects for each storm separately, we saw that the potential for protection decreased for all storms as the necessary thresholds are increased. Hurricanes Irene and Isabel resulted in greater flooding within the bay, as compared to Floyd and Sandy, and we see a greater potential for protection from those storms. In examining the effect of thresholds relative to the zero-threshold case, the potential protection by applying a 5 sq. km threshold is reduced by 96.6 % (down to 3.4 % of the population protected if all wetlands are considered). If thresholds of 25 sq. km or greater were deemed most effective for attenuation in this region, that percentage decreases to less than 1 %. This methodology allows for the determination of a range of protection scenarios based on spatial scale thresholds. For this region, if effective storm surge protection from wetlands is significantly dependent on spatial scales larger than 5 sq. km, emergency managers may use this tool to determine areas of relevance: Hampton Roads and Gloucester coastal marshes, based on the inputs we have applied. The wide range in results obtained over all wetland thresholds and wetland datasets reinforces the importance of consideration of uncertainties and variabilities in the way wetlands are delineated, and their internal geometries represented, for the purposes of defining regionally applicable storm surge attenuation rates over marsh areas. While this methodology does not include determination of the overall impact of wetlands on the propagation of storm surge in the study region (i.e., reduction in wind momentum transferred to the water column), it allows for consideration of direct protection to population and infrastructure in the proximity of wetland areas. As gaps in knowledge continue to be filled regarding spatial scales needed for attenuation, such a context will be critical in assessing the suitability of wetland restoration as part of future coastal protection strategies, either alone or in combination with engineered structures. By modifying wetland dataset inputs, the framework can be used to assess reduction or increase in property damage if wetland areas were allowed to degrade or were restored. It is expected that outcomes of appropriate spatial scales relevant for wetland protection vary greatly based on the demographics and physical characteristics of the coastline to which it is applied, as well as the types of storms included. While findings presented here are specific to the study region, the framework and location-specific variations thereof are transferrable to other regions, with careful selection of parameters including storm inputs, wetland datasets, and characterization of appropriate thresholds for limitations of wetland spatial scales."}]
