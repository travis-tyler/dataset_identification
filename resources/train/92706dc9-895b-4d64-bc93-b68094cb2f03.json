Ynicl (2018),\nObjective: To provide a multi-atlas framework for automated hippocampus segmentation in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and clinically validate the results with respect to surgical lateralization and post-surgical outcome.\nWe retrospectively identified 47 TLE patients who underwent surgical resection and 12 healthy controls. T1-weighted 3T MRI scans were acquired for all subjects, and patients were identified by a neuroradiologist with regards to lateralization and degree of hippocampal sclerosis (HS). Automated segmentation was implemented through the Joint Label Fusion/Corrective Learning (JLF/CL) method. Gold standard lateralization was determined from the surgically resected side in Engel I (seizure-free) patients at the two-year timepoint. ROC curves were used to identify appropriate thresholds for hippocampal asymmetry ratios, which were then used to analyze JLF/CL lateralization.\nThe optimal template atlas based on subject images with varying appearances, from normal-appearing to severe HS, was demonstrated to be composed entirely of normal-appearing subjects, with good agreement between automated and manual segmentations. In applying this atlas to 26 surgically resected seizure-free patients at a two-year timepoint, JLF/CL lateralized seizure onset 92% of the time. In comparison, neuroradiology reads lateralized 65% of patients, but correctly lateralized seizure onset in these patients 100% of the time. When compared to lateralized neuroradiology reads, JLF/CL was in agreement and correctly lateralized all 17 patients. When compared to nonlateralized radiology reads, JLF/CL correctly lateralized 78% of the nine patients.\nSignificance: While a neuroradiologist's interpretation of MR imaging is a key, albeit imperfect, diagnostic tool for seizure localization in medically-refractory TLE patients, automated hippocampal segmentation may provide more efficient and accurate epileptic foci localization. These promising findings demonstrate the clinical utility of automated segmentation in the TLE MR imaging pipeline prior to surgical resection, and suggest that further investigation into JLF/CL-assisted MRI reading could improve clinical outcomes.

Due to the severe nature of the disease, surgical intervention is often required to achieve seizure freedom, and MRI is featured prominently in pre-surgical evaluation. Since 87% of all surgically resected patients have some degree of histopathological change, accurate identification of the epileptogenic focus, aided by radiology reads, is essential and has been associated with improved surgical outcomes, such that up to 83% of patients with a well-identified seizure focus can achieve good surgical outcome [3] [4] [5] .\nAdditionally, further progress in identification of MRI lesions could improve outcomes for lesional (MRI-positive) patients, due to the extent of lesion resection being associated with surgical outcome 6 . Furthermore, it is thought that the inability to adequately visualize the epileptogenic focus prior to potential surgical resection contributes to the worse outcomes nonlesional patients experience following surgery, with lesional TLE patients being 2.7 times more likely to achieve seizure freedom following surgery 7 .\nCurrently, MRI scans of TLE patients are evaluated qualitatively by a neuroradiologist to identify areas of HS and atrophy for presurgical evaluation, findings which are typically associated with better outcomes following successful surgical resection 8 . Additionally, ipsilateral volume loss in HS is correlated with seizure frequency, with medically refractory TLE being associated with progressive hippocampal atrophy 9 . To quantitatively evaluate abnormalities in hippocampal volume requires segmentation, which without automated tools is time-consuming and prone to human error. Despite the availability of automated hippocampal volumetry tools, they are rarely used in the clinical pre-surgical evaluation pipeline, in part due"}, {"section_title": "A C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T", "text": "to limited validation of their efficacy vis-\u00e0-vis the clinical standard of qualitative evaluation 10 .\nHowever, studies have shown that volumetric changes alone in the hippocampus are associated with outcome, particularly in patients with hippocampal sclerosis 11 .\nRecent advances in multi-atlas, patch-based label fusion techniques have led to robust automatic hippocampus segmentation methods that are competitive with expert human segmenters in terms of reliability [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Such methods have been extensively evaluated in the context of Alzheimer's disease and could allow for earlier detection and treatment of the disease 17 . To automatically segment a novel \"target\" image, these methods utilize a set of similar expert-labeled example images, known as atlases. Each atlas image is registered nonlinearly onto the target image, and the warped atlas segmentations are fused to form a consensus segmentation of the hippocampus in the target image. A particular implementation of this strategy, joint label fusion with corrective learning (JLF/CL) , has achieved leading performance in a range of applications, including in international competitions 18 . This JLF/CL algorithm is implemented through the repurposed open-source software tool \"Automated Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields\" (ASHS) for T1-weighted images, available at https://www.nitrc.org/projects/ashs/ under the Penn Temporal Lobe Epilepsy T1-MRI Whole Hippocampus ASHS Atlas: ASHS 1.0 Compatible release entry with the filename ashs_atlas_penntle_hippo_20170915.tar. Despite its name, ASHS can be easily trained to segment structures other than hippocampal subfields, including the whole hippocampus-of note, we are using JLF/CL through ASHS with T1weighted images passed in for both inputs (no T2-weighted imaging used) to segment out the whole hippocampi, and not the subfields.\nOur paper seeks to evaluate the performance of JLF/CL in the context of whole hippocampus segmentation in clinical MRI scans obtained during presurgical evaluation of TLE\npatients. From the methodological perspective, we seek to determine whether the composition of the atlas set in JLF/CL (in terms of the proportion of patients with hippocampal abnormality) significantly affects segmentation accuracy. From the clinical perspective, we seek to evaluate the efficacy of using quantitative measures of hippocampal volume derived by JLF/CL as an alternative or complement to qualitative neuroradiological assessment for lateralization of the TLE seizure focus. Lateralization accuracy by JLF/CL and neuroradiologists is evaluated against the gold standard of seizure-free outcome after surgical resection.\n\n\nFor each cross-validation experiment, JLF/CL was trained using the atlas set and used to segment the images in the test set. The automated segmentation of the test set was compared to the manual segmentation of the test set in terms of Dice similarity coefficient, a measure of relative overlap 23 \nAnalysis was conducted in MATLAB and R with the ggplot2, pROC, and BlandAltmanLeh packages. Statistical significance was set at a p-value of 0.05, unless otherwise noted.\nThe subset of epilepsy patients who received surgery and attained Engel I outcome at two years post-surgery (N=26) was used to define the \"gold standard\" for seizure site lateralization.\nIn other words, the subject whose left medial temporal lobe was resected and who was seizurefree two years after surgery, was considered to truly have left-lateralized TLE. The 2-year time point was used because seizure freedom at two years after surgery is consistently reported to be predictive of long-term seizure freedom 25 . Among these subjects, we distinguish between a subset for whom the neuroradiologists indicated the apparent site of seizure in the radiological read (\"MRI-lateralized\" class, N=17) and a subset where the neuroradiologists were unable to determine the site of seizure (\"MRI-nonlateralized\", N=9). more positive than -0.062482 are considered to have larger right hippocampi, and those that fall within these boundaries are considered to be indeterminate in lateralization. Of note, our subject population was clearly delineated between left and right outside of this threshold range.\n\npathological asymmetry; indeed, several studies have indicated that right hippocampi are slightly larger than left in healthy adults, and such asymmetry is manifested in the dentate gyrus [27] [28] [29] [30] .\nOnly two patients were incorrectly lateralized based on the JLF/CL asymmetry ratio threshold ( Figure 4B ). Of note, the 95% confidence interval is wide (79%-100% for all patients, 11%-100% for MRI nonlateralized), but this is likely due to the small sample of 26 Engel I patients.\nThe radiological reports lateralized 17 of 26 patients (65%), correctly lateralizing seizure onset in all 17 of those cases, leading to a positive predictive value of 100% (Table 2) For the poor outcome patients (Engel II, III, and IV), correct lateralization cannot be determined, since the surgery did not achieve seizure freedom. When looking at the neuroradiology reads of all patients in Table 2 , including both good and poor outcomes, 10 of the\n27 lateralized patients (37%) had poor outcomes, as opposed to six of the 15 nonlateralized patients (45%) who had poor outcomes.\nappearance to the target image. More data with manual segmentations would be needed to test this.\nOverall, however, the Dice coefficients for normal and abnormal phenotypes (0.84-0.87) are within the same range of 0.8 to 0.9 seen in the multi-atlas and patch-based literature, attesting to the robustness of the JLF/CL method with use of T1-weighted imaging [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . In a recent study involving only healthy subjects, the volBrain method demonstrated better segmentation of the hippocampus using 22 subjects with MP2RAGE (2 T1-weighted images with different inversion times) imaging compared to FSL, FreeSurfer, and SPM with a Dice coefficient of 0.892 38 . In other studies investigating automated segmentation in epilepsy without distinction of hippocampal sclerosis severity, the Dice coefficient has ranged from 0.847, with 3T scans using the STEPS method, to 0.78 with ABSS, 0.74 with LocalInfo, 0.67 with FreeSurfer, and 0.65 with Hammer 32,39 .\nOur JLF/CL method, although demonstrating a Dice coefficient of 0.87 for the 12 controls and 11 normal-appearing patients, was able to produce a Dice coefficient of 0.85 for all subjects, with 0.85 for mild hippocampal sclerosis and 0.84 for severe hippocampal sclerosis.\nThis indicates that the JLF/CL method performs with similar accuracy to other methods with normal subjects, but also has the ability to better segment hippocampi in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, including differing hippocampal sclerosis severity. Even with a smaller atlas set (only 20 subjects required) that has been seen in the literature, our method performed similarly to other methods that required 400-subject atlas sets 32, 38 . The comparison between manual and automated segmentations indicated overall good agreement for the asymmetry measurements, allowing us to proceed with clinical validation analysis based on the JLF/CL-derived asymmetry indices.\nWhile there are different methods of automated segmentation, based on our analysis of the accuracy of the JLF/CL compared to that of others (as described previously), the Dice scores were comparable. As a result, the JLF/CL method was implemented for the clinical lateralization experiments. However, this clinical lateralization analysis was also run using the results of FreeSurfer, as a confirmation ( Supplementary Figure 2) . FreeSurfer produced a lower AUC of 0.85 (compared to JLF/CL of 0.92). It inaccurately lateralized 2 of the 9 non-lateralized patients, as the JLF/CL method did, but additionally incorrectly lateralized a right-sided patient to the left (which JLF/CL did not do). Since this study was not powered to detect the superiority of one automated segmentation method over another, futures investigations will be needed to answer that question. Regardless of the method ultimately chosen, the analysis of automated segmentation as it relates to clinical outcomes as opposed to pathology is a novel one, and could hopefully be used to improve patient care."}, {"section_title": "ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT", "text": "\n\n\n\n\nA C C E P T E D M A N U S C R I P T\nA many others, and were not incorporated in this JLF/CL method. Future studies dedicated to incorporating more of these variables into machine learning-based approaches could enable these automated techniques to become an invaluable part of clinical practice.\nAlthough we based good outcome on correct lateralization with corresponding surgical resection, it is possible that some of the patients who were listed as poor outcome were correctly lateralized, but incorrectly localized or incompletely resected on the ipsilateral side to the seizure focus. The lack of additional clinical information in our data set, specifically intracranial EEG recordings, prevents finer resolution of the seizure onset zone. Future studies using patient cohorts with intracranial EEG data confirming seizure onset will further validate our work. In addition, the true extent of resections in cases of anterior temporal lobectomies and newer surgical techniques, such as laser ablation, are required to determine volume and subfields of hippocampus removed and adjust the analysis to account for these confounds in surgical technique."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Population", "text": "The 59 subjects (47 TLE and 12 controls) all underwent 3T T1-weighted brain MRI scans performed for clinical purposes ( Supplementary Table 1 Table 1 ).

This noninvasive, clinically-focused approach (through a neuroradiologist read) to categorizing atrophy was used solely to ensure that the images inputted to the JLF/CL algorithm could be grouped by severity, a metric which was not consistently included in radiologic reports. Due to concerns about the degree of variation in hippocampal sclerosis for clinical patient scans, it was important to be able to create atlases that could work not only in theory, but also in practice. It was thought that, by creating atlases that more closely mimicked the patient population (an atlas with a larger proportion of severe hippocampal sclerosis subjects to segment a target image with severe hippocampal sclerosis), a better segmentation would be achieved. There is also existing research into the various types of hippocampal sclerosis, resulting in the designation of HS ILAE Types 1-3 based on subfield-predominant loss on pathology and are associated with different outcomes; this provides a further impetus towards tailoring the clinical application of our segmentation techniques to the patient's degree of disease 19 ."}, {"section_title": "Segmentation", "text": "All subjects were manually segmented by trained researchers (C.C. and L.C.) using ITK-SNAP 20 .

This is a new and somewhat surprising finding, as intuition and some of the current rationale behind multi-atlas segmentation suggest that subjects with hippocampal atrophy would be best segmented using atlases that also have hippocampal atrophy, by matching the atlas to the population 31 . This result might indicate that there is substantial heterogeneity in the appearance of hippocampal sclerosis, such that patients with sclerosis included in the atlas do not necessarily have appearance similar enough to the target subject to aid segmentation. The observation that normal-appearing patients could produce a better segmentation overall, and when focused on segmenting normal-appearing patients, is likely due to the relative homogeneity amongst the normal-appearing hippocampi patient population; this would create more similarities between the atlas and the subject image, and lead to better segmentations. However, since patients with diseased hippocampi can have more variability in their imaging relative to that of patients with normal-appearing hippocampi, an atlas of diseased patients will not necessarily be representative for a given diseased patient in this heterogenous population, creating a potential mismatch between the atlas and target image and a poorer segmentation. In a similar vein, applying an atlas composed of normal-appearing subjects would likely create a poor segmentation when looking at the subject image of a diseased patient.\nIt is possible that with a larger atlas size, we would have found a relationship between the proportion of subjects with abnormal phenotype and segmentation accuracy for subjects with abnormal phenotype, as such larger atlases would be more likely to include images similar in"}, {"section_title": "Clinical Significance", "text": "It is important to emphasize the translational importance of these findings.
