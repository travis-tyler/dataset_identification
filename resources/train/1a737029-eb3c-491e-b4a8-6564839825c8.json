[{"section_title": "", "text": "I n the U.S. workforce, early career doctorates-persons receiving their first doctorate within the past 10 years-are a diverse group that includes both U.S. and non-U.S. citizens trained either in the United States or abroad. The Early Career Doctorates Survey (ECDS), sponsored by the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) within the National Science Foundation and by the National Institutes of Health, gathers in-depth information about such individuals who are employed at U.S. master's-and doctorate-granting academic institutions, federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs), or the National Institutes of Health Intramural Research Program (NIH IRP). The statistics in this report are from the 2015 ECDS pilot study (see the Data Sources and Limitations section for more information about the pilot). Most of this estimated 228,700 early career doctorates population were employed in academic institutions (96%), and the majority earned their first doctoral degree in the sciences (70%). Approximately 19% earned their first doctoral degree from a foreign academic institution. When asked where they planned to work in the next 10 years, 69% of the early career doctorates planned to work only in the United States, 27% planned to work in both the United States and abroad, and 3% planned to work abroad."}, {"section_title": "Citizenship Status and Origin of Doctoral Degree", "text": "U.S. citizens and permanent residents accounted for 65% of the early career doctorates population in 2015, with 97% earning their first doctorate from a U.S. academic institution.

Citizens of Canada, China, India, Germany, and South Korea constituted nearly two-thirds of the U.S.-trained temporary visa holders and 14% of the U.S.-trained early career doctorates (table 1).

This survey does not cover early career doctorates employed in the nonprofit and for profit sectors. For the ECDS pilot study, the first stage is a stratified sample of institutions in the three sampled employment settings. Of the sampled institutions, 84.7% participated in the pilot study and provided lists of all early career doctorates working at their institution. The total sample size for the second stage was 6,827 potential early career doctorates (5,120 from institutions in the Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering, 1,457 from FFRDCs, and 250 from the NIH IRP). The overall individual response rate was 66%. The ECDS pilot study estimated 228,700 early career doctorates overall, with 218,800 working at U.S. master's-and doctorate-granting academic institutions, 7,500 at FFRDCs, and 2,400 at the NIH IRP."}]
