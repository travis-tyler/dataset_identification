[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Farm income is highly variable, with earnings subject to wide fluctuations in yields and prices. Farmers may try to cope with farm income variation in many ways, including working off-farm, diversifying their farm enterprises, and altering their farm production practices. Because household income volatility influences what, how, and how much a farm produces, it can have important implications for rural household welfare, agricultural production, and environmental quality. Farm households exhibit considerably higher levels of income than typical U.S. household (USDA 2015b). 1 For the nearly 1 million U.S. farmers who consider farming their primary occupation, variability from farm income can be a challenging part of running a farm business. Farm households also tend to have considerable current assets from their farm operation and non-farm holdings which may be used to smooth income, through sale or using a portion of the assets as collateral for a loan. Even for these farms, a sizable portion of annual income is derived from off-farm sources, including wage labor, earnings from other businesses, which can also be sources of farm household income variability. Federal agricultural policies have long sought to shelter farmers from income fluctuations using price supports, direct income support, disaster assistance programs and crop yield and revenue insurance programs. The 2014 Farm Act ended fixed annual payments to producers based on historical production, and created new programs tied to annual or multi-year fluctuations in prices, yields, or revenues. The new programs include those that pay producers when prices fall below a reference price (Price Loss Coverage (PLC) and Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC)), and crop insurance programs aimed at providing support for shallow revenue or yield losses This paper examines farm household income volatility across the United States from 1996 to 2013 using a large national panel dataset collected by the USDA. We look for secular trends in income variability across time and for differences between types of farms. We include three new analyses which contribute to the larger understanding of farm household volatility. First, we use regression analysis to uncover the determinants of an individual farm's volatility. Second, we decompose total household income into farm, non-farm and other components and trace which of these components contribute to the overall volatility. Lastly, we look at the effects of U.S. government programs of farm household income variability and welfare. We use a certainty equivalent measure to see how much a dollar of a particular program is worth to the farmer."}, {"section_title": "Literature Review", "text": "While little is known about the income volatility of farm households, a large body of economics research has examined the income volatility of individuals and households more generallyseeking to identify how volatility varies across income categories and over time. Early studies focused on decomposing the cross-sectional variance in individual earnings into permanent and transitory components and on identifying time trends using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) (Gottschalk and Moffitt, 1994;Haider, 2001) or the Current Population Survey (CPS) (Cameron and Tracy, 1998). More recent studies have examined trends in non-farm income volatility using simpler measures of volatility, which are usually function of the percent change in income over the previous year (e.g., Congressional Budget Office, 2008;Dahl, DeLeire, and Schwabish, 2011;Dynan, Elmendorf, and Sichel 2012;Moffitt and Gottschalk, 2011;Shin and Solon 2011;Ziliak, Hardy, and Bollinger, 2011). Most of these studies find more income variability in the 1980s than in the 1970s and flat trends in variability during the 1980s and early 1990sthough these studies differ in their findings in more recent periods. A more limited number of papers have explored the volatility of farm business income using small surveys of farmers in the United States, Canada or Europe. Most studies focusing on the variability of farm income have used a regression analysis to examine the determinants of variability. In an early study, Schurle and Tholstrup (1989) developed a model to estimate the relationships between enterprise mix and the variance of income. Using panel data on Kansas farms, they regress a measure of business risk on covariates, including enterprise mix, farm and operator characteristics, and government payments per dollar. Schurle and Tholstrup's measures of the mean and variance of returns on equity is used by Purdy et al (1997) who assess the returns to risk specialization in a panel of Kansas farms, finding that certain types of specialization can decrease volatility and that farms with both crop and livestock operations are less volatile. Mishra and Goodwin (1997) showed that increased farm income variability led farm households to work more off-farm, though households were less likely to do so if they received support through government farm programs. More recently, Poon and Weersink (2011) used a panel dataset of Canadian farmers and Enjolras et al. (2014) used a panel of French and Italian farm to estimate the determinants of the variation in farm income. Studies of U.S. farm income variability that have used nationally representative data have relied on cross-sectional surveys, and have estimated income variation across farms at a single point in time. For example, Mishra and El-Osta (2001) used ERS ARMS data to investigate the sources of variability of total farm household income (farm and off-farm) in 1995 and 1999. For each year, they use a normalized variance decomposition to show how farm household income variation differs for farmers who participate in commodity programs compared to those who do not. Since commodity prices, policies and to some extent yields covary across timesometimes resulting in \"boom\" and \"bust\" yearsexamining variation in income across farms at one point in time likely under-estimates individual farm income variation."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "For this analysis, we use matched data from individual years of the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS), an annual USDA survey carried out by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and Economic Research Service (ERS) (USDA, 2015a). Although the ARMS is not a panel survey, some farms are surveyed multiple times due either to random chance or their agricultural importance within their state. 2 There are 38,317 farms which were surveyed more than once in annual ARMS surveys between 1996 and 2013. Of these, 29,488 were surveyed twice, with another 6,647 surveyed three times. Because most observations occurred only twice, the bulk of this analysis uses a \"pairs\" panel dataset, which compares two points in time. For farm households which were surveyed more than twice, we add one pair for each additional year of data. 3 After creating the \"pairs\" dataset, we drop observations where there the span between two years is greater than 5 years. 4 Observations were also dropped if the difference in operator age between two observations was more than 7 years (implying that a different household is operating the farm) or if the household had a negative net worth (to ensure consistency across different volatility measures). For the regression analysis, we use all observations and construct volatility measures using the total number of available years for the particular observation. Because farms with higher number of observations tend to be larger and more variable (and may have other, unobservable characteristics), we control for the number of times a farm household is surveyed, as well as for the number of average number of years between observations. Table 1 shows differences in median income and assets for each year between the panel and full ARMS samples. As compared with the full ARMS sample, the farm households which were surveyed more than once tend to operate larger farms and generate a higher value of production. On average, farms in the panel dataset received less income from off-farm activities, such as wage labor, and significantly more from their on-farm operations."}, {"section_title": "Measuring Farm Household Income Volatility", "text": "One challenge working with farm household data is that in any year a significant proportion of households have negative farm or household income. 5 In the \"pairs\" panel dataset, roughly 30% of households realized negative farm income each year and 14% had negative income in both years. These values are similar to the average number of farms with negative income in the annual ARMS surveys: between 1996 and 2013, 36.5% of sampled farms had negative farm income and 11.0% had negative total household income. 6 Because of these negative values, it is not possible to use some standard measures of income change, such as the percent change or the arc percent change. Instead we develop alternative measures of volatility that allow for negative income values. The first volatility measure is the absolute value of the arc percent change (AAPC). The arc percent change is a measure frequently used in the economics literature to assess changes in income because it has the advantage of being bounded at 0 and 200 (Dyan, Elmendorf and Sichel, 2012;Hardy and Ziliak, 2014). The AAPC provides a measure of the magnitude of income change and when compared to average income, is an indicator of income volatility. The AAPC in income between two years is defined: where is the income earned by household i in year t and \u0305 is the average income over the two years. This measure successfully incorporates negative values. However, in cases where income is positive in one year and negative or zero in the other, the index will always equal 200, regardless of the magnitude the change. 7 A second measure of volatility is the absolute value of the coefficient of variation (ACV) of income across time: Note that the standard deviation of income is calculated independently for each household. A problem can arise with this measure in cases where households realize a very small average income-for instance, if a large loss in one year offsets the other year's income. In these cases, the estimated ACV can be extremely large. 8 To address this, we use a related measure, ACV10, which includes only coefficients of variation below 10 in absolute value. This measure drops 2.9% of observations."}, {"section_title": "Asset-based Measures", "text": "We also use two measures of income volatility relative to assets. Assets provide a convenient base for comparing income changes because they are positive by definition. The first asset measure is the standard deviation of total (or farm) income divided by total (or farm) assets. where \u0305 is the average assets over the number of periods the household is observed. The square of this measure, the variance of income divided by the square of the assets, is sometimes called \"business risk\" (Schurle and Tholstrup, 1989). Because it is right-skewed, we use the log of business risk in our analysis: Many analyses of farm finances use the rate of return on assets (ROA): pre-tax farm income divided by farm assets. This measures how effectively assets are being utilized for profit generation. The final measure, the absolute change in returns to assets (CRA), is similar but uses the two-year absolute difference in income rather than average income. This creates a measure which shows how volatile income is in relation to owned assets. When calculating the CRA for farm income we use farm assets in the denominator. Similarly, for total household income we use total household assets."}, {"section_title": "Aggregate Volatility Measures", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Crop versus livestock farms", "text": "First we categorize farms based on whether most of their total value of production across each two-year period originated from either crops or livestock. 9 Table 2 shows the income, assets, and government payments for crop and livestock farms for all two-year observations within the panel dataset. Crop farms, which constitute 51.6% of all pairs within the dataset, tend to be larger, and receive more income and government payments. Crop farms received a median farm income of $72,322-double that of livestock farms-and they received $34,647 from non-farm income, only 10% more than livestock farms. Crop farms also had 10% more household assets than livestock farms, and similar amount of debt. Crop farms received about four times as many government payments as livestock farm-mostly in the form of commodity payments, such as direct payment, counter-cyclical payments and marketing loan benefits. As would be expected, crop farms also had higher participation in crop insurance programs, paying $17,158 in average premiums, compared to $2,478 for livestock farms. 9 Information on the value of production across roughly 15 different commodities were present in the dataset. The median value of production for crop farms was $73,318 and for livestock farms was $195,666. 134 farms did not record any production value and are excluded from this part of the analysis. These excluded operations do fit the USDA definition of a farm and may have received income from, for instance, sales of stored inventory or conservation payments on non-producing lands. Crop farms experienced higher levels of income volatility, according to most measures (table 3). Crop farms had greater average gains and losses. They also had a larger average absolute arc percentage change (AAPC) absolute coefficient of variation (ACV), change in return to assets (CRA) and business risk for both farm household and total household income. One reason that livestock producers might have less income volatility is that many use production contracts. Production contracts are arrangements where farmers are paid a fee to feed and care for animals. Their fee usually does not depend on the market price of their product; hence they are not exposed to a significant source of farm income risk. Approximate 36.0% of livestock producers in the sample used production contracts, compared to only 5.9% of crop farmers. For crop farms, production contracts amounted to more than 10% of all production value for less than 4% of farms. Conversely, production contracts accounted for over 50% of the value of their production for 90% of livestock farms with a production contract."}, {"section_title": "Farm Type and Asset Class", "text": "In the United States, most farms are small-scale and most farm households obtain most of their income from off-farm sources. However, most agricultural output is produced on large scale operations with operators whose primary occupation is farming. The panel dataset oversamples the larger farms which produce most agricultural products. Hence, aggregate measures of income and volatility based on the panel data do not reflect the circumstances of most farm households. To examine how volatility varies with farm size we categorize crop and livestock farms based on their farm assets. As expected, farms with more assets earned more farm income, and earned a greater share of their total household income from farm sources ( For crop farms, farm income volatility is constant across asset categories. Using income based measures, larger farms do not experience more farm income fluctuations than smaller farms. However, total household income volatility increases as farm size increases. This is because at lower asset levels, farm income represents a relatively small share of total income. As farms grow larger, the portion of total household income coming from farm operations increases. Total income volatility converges to farm income volatility for the largest farms. For example, for crop farms, farm household income volatility (ACV) remains steady between 0.89 and 0.92 across asset categories, but total household income volatility rises monotonically from 0.55 to 0.84. For crop farms, the typical (median) level of total income derived from the farm similarly rises from 48% for farms with less than $750,000 of farm assets to 92% for firms with more than 3 million dollars of assets. The asset based measures of volatility tell a somewhat different story. For livestock, and especially crop farms, asset based volatility measures decline with farm size. This likely reflects the increasing return to scale of larger operations. Large farms are able to produce more output and income per dollar of assets. As a result the absolute value of the change in income per dollar of assets is smaller for larger farms. Hence, while income becomes more volatile as farm size grows, business risk (return on assets) actually declines. "}, {"section_title": "Changes over time", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Regression Analysis", "text": "In this section, we present regressions of various volatility measures on individual farm attributes while controlling for regional variation. The regressions allow us to identify which exogenous farm characteristics, such as size and location are associated with income volatility. By controlling for exogenous factors we are also able to identify time trends in the volatility measures. For the regression we use the full panel dataset, rather than the \"pairs\" dataset used in the previous sections. The full panel includes all farms in the ARMS dataset which have appeared two or more times since 1996, a total of 38,317 farms and 88,269 observations. Each household appears between two and eight times in the dataset as shown in Appendix Table 1. Because more than three-fourths of the observations are only observed twice, we generate one measure of volatility per household. Although this does not allow us to trace an individual household's volatility across time for households that were observed more than twice, it does generate a consistent metric for each farm household. Table 6 shows summary statistics for all households in the full panel. We use three distinct measures of household income volatility, described above: the truncated absolute coefficient of variation (ACV10), and its log; the log of business risk (LN_BRISK); and, the standard deviation of income divided by assets (SD_ASSETS). The typical farm household appears twice in the dataset, roughly 4 years apart. It has average sales of $500,000 and household assets of $1.57 million. Most operators (84%) report farming as their primary occupation, and the mean and median farm age is 55. We include dummy variables for each of the production regions of USDA's Economic Research Service (ERS). The omitted category is the Heartland region, comprising Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, large parts of Missouri and Ohio and smaller parts of Kentucky, Minnesota, and the Dakotas. Volatility in this region is low, relative to the national average. We also include indicator variables for those households which own poultry, cattle, and corn farms producing an average of $10,000 in any one of those categories. As compared with the full ARMS dataset, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. agricultural sector when survey weights are used, the panel dataset contains a skewed sample of farm households (See Appendix Table 2). These farm households own and operate larger farms and derive more of their total household income from farm operations and less (in both relative and absolute terms) from off-farm sources. As the yearly breakdown shows, the biggest discrepancy between the panel and complete datasets is in farm income and becomes most pronounced at the end of the dataset, from 2009-2013. The households in the panel dataset own more farm assets and similar amount of non-farm assets. We use a standard ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model, regressing measures of volatility on farm characteristics using the following equation: where is the volatility measure, the vector contains observational information, such as the number of times a farm appears in the dataset and the distance between observations, both of which contribute to higher observed volatility. contains farm and operator characteristics. We use a time trend to measure change in volatility across the period from 1996-2013 and regional dummies to account for those characteristics. Finally, we use state-clustered standard errors, with groupings for each of the lower 48 states. Table 7 shows the regression results. The first two columns regress income measures of volatility-the absolute value of the coefficient of variation and its log; the second two columns use asset-based measures, business risk and the standard deviation of income divided by mean assets. In each case, the time trend-expressed as the coefficient on the average year variableis negative, indicating that, across all farm households, volatility decreased over this period by approximately 0.6% per year, according to the ACV10 metric. Total household income volatility is lower if the principal operator has more education. This relationship is likely due to the greater importance of off-farm income in total income for better educated operators. While households in the lowest educational category earned roughly $42,000 per year from off-farm sources between 1996 and 2013, those in the highest earned $79,000 each year, on average. Those farms which are more highly leveraged and whose principal operator's primary occupation is farming have considerably higher levels of total household income volatility."}, {"section_title": "Decomposition of Income Variation", "text": "For farm households, total income is comprised of farm income (including payments from government programs) and non-farm income (wage income and non-wage income). To understand the extent to which of these components contributes to total income variation we decompose total income variation into four major components: farm income, agricultural payments, off farm wage income, and other income. Assuming each of these income components, , is a random variable then the variance of household income is the sum of the 4x4 covariance matrix with elements ( , ). That is: , where each covariance term is computed for each observation as: If income components, such as farm income and non-farm wage income, are negatively correlated, then the total variance will be lower than if these income sources were positively correlated. For the case of four income components, the contribution of the \u210e component to total income variability is sum of the elements of the \u210e row of the 4x4 covariance matrix: The sum of the four variance components is the total variance: . So the share of the \u210e component in total variance is: Table 8 shows the covariance matrix for the four main income components divided by the total variance. Hence, the sum of each row (or column) shows the share of each income component in total variance, ( ). Results indicate that for the average farm in the sample, farm income contributes 77% of all income variation, non-farm wage income 10%, non-farm non-wage income 10%, and agricultural payments 3%."}, {"section_title": "Contribution of Income Components to Total Variance", "text": "As shown in the first row (or column) total income risk is substantially mitigated by the negative correlation between net farm income and the other three income sources. The variance of farm income alone is 107% of total income variance. However because farm income is negatively correlated with the other income sources, its total share of household income volatility is only 77%. The covariance of program payments with non-farm income sources are small and negative which slightly reduces total income risk. Similarly non-farm wage income is slightly negatively correlated with non-farm nonwage income."}, {"section_title": "Income component variance shares by farm type", "text": "Next we estimate the variance components shares for all farms and separately for primary crop and primary livestock producers by farm asset quartile (table 9). The table shows the sample means for each component, where extreme outliers have been dropped. 10 The results display several patterns about the contributions of farm income, agricultural payments, and wage and nonwage income to total variance. For all farm types, farm income contributes the largest share of variation to total income and the share of farm income in total variation increases with farm asset class: from 60% to 90% for crop farms, and from 49% to 87% for livestock farms. In each asset category, farm income contributes a larger share to total variance for crop farms than it does for livestock farms. This is likely explained by the fact that crop income is more variable than livestock income, which makes farm income more variable for crop farms. Conversely, the share of non-farm income (both wage and non-wage) in total variance decreases as farm assets increase for both crop and livestock farms. For the largest farms, non-farm income only contributes 9% of income risk compared to 41% for the smallest. This difference likely reflects the greater specialization of household labor in on-farm work for the larger operations. Larger operations also derive relatively more income risk from nonwage income compared to wage income compared to smaller operations. Among the largest farms, wage income contributes 3% of risk compared to 6% for nonwage income. For the smallest farms, wage income contributes 25% of total risk compared to 17% for nonwage income. This pattern reflects the relative importance of nonwage income for larger-scale operations. Agricultural payments contribute only about 3 percent of total income variation despite contributing about 17% to total income. Interestingly, the contribution of payments to risk 10 For some farms, the total income variance (the denominator in (8)) is much smaller than the variance of individual income components (the numerator) causing the component variance share CS to be exceptionally large or small. Because these outliers have a disproportionate effect on the average component variance share, we delete observations with a component variance share larger than 300% or less than -300% of total income variance. declines with farm asset size for crop farms, but increases with asset size for livestock farms. It is possible that the large crop farms receive relatively more payments from risk mitigating sources (e.g. countercyclical payments or disaster relief). Risk mitigating payments might be correlated with crop production rather than with livestock productionso the payments do not diminish total risk as effectively as livestock production increases. Overall, payment levels are much lower for livestock operations (table 4), which explains why payments have a lower contribution to income variation for livestock operations."}, {"section_title": "How do agricultural payments affect household income risk and welfare?", "text": "It is possible to observe how agricultural payments (e.g. commodity, conservation, or net crop insurance payments) affect income risk by estimating the mean and standard deviation (SD) of income with and without the payments. The SD provides an easily interpreted measure of income dispersion. If income varies randomly year to year and is normally distributed, then about 68% of the time realized income will fall within one SD of mean income, and about 95% of the time it will fall within 2 SDs of the mean. The coefficient of variation (CV), which is the SD divided by the mean, provides a unitless measure of variation relative to the mean. If the CV is large, then income varies widely relative to the mean, whereas if it is small then income usually falls within a narrow range around the mean. While changes in the SD and CV provide insight into how payments affect income risk, these changes do not indicate whether a household is better off. Risk-averse individuals care about both their income level and income variationthey would be willing to trade some income for less risk. Neither the SD nor the CV captures this tradeoff -an increase or decrease in either measure does not indicate whether an individual is better off. For example, a program that doubles farm income would also double the SD of income and would clearly make a farmer better off. On the other hand, a program that left average income the same but raised it in good years and lowered it in bad years would also increase the SD of income, but would make a risk-averse farmer worse off. A similar problem can arise with the CV. An increase (decrease) the CV does not necessarily imply a decrease (increase) in welfare."}, {"section_title": "Estimating welfare impacts", "text": "One approach to rank risky alternatives (e.g. to compare income with and without government payments) is to compare the certainty equivalent (CE) for each alternative. The CE is the certain amount an individual would be just as happy receiving compared to the risky income source. Among risky alternatives, an agent will always prefer the one with the highest CE. Estimating the CE requires making assumptions about how individuals' tradeoff risk versus return -that is, assumptions about individuals' utility functions. It is often convenient to assume that individuals display constant absolute risk aversion (CARA)that is, risk aversion does not vary with wealth. The negative exponential is a CARA utility function: where is the coefficient of absolute risk aversion 11 and is income. With a negative exponential utility and with risky income having a normal distribution, it can be shown that the certainty equivalent is a function of the mean and the variance of the income distribution: It follows that the additional certain benefits from having an income with government payments (p) compared to an income with no payments (np) is: where the subscript i has been dropped for clarity. The additional benefit increases with the increase in expected returns (first term in parentheses) and decreases with the increase in 11 The coefficient of absolute risk aversion is defined: = \u2212 \u2032\u2032 ( ) \u2032 ( ) variance (second term).

We can compare programs by comparing benefits per program dollar. For a given expenditure, programs that reduce income variation more will generate greater benefits (CE) per dollar. The average benefit per expected dollar of program p compared to no program (np) is: We can compute the average benefit per expected dollar for each program for each household based on observed average income and income variance with and without the program and an assumed risk aversion coefficient. For the following analysis we use a \"moderate\" risk aversion value computed as: = 2/ , where is household net worth (Anderson and Dillon, 1992 When payments from each category are added to base income separately, income with the payments has a lower CV than income with no payments. This suggests that all types of payments reduce income risk, as measured by the CV. However, the magnitude of the reduction in the CV does not tell us which program is more effective at reducing risk on a per dollar basis. The reduction in the CV is largely proportional to the size of each programcommodity payments are the largest source of payments and they reduce the CV the most, followed by \"other\" payments and then conservation payments. To gain insight into benefits per dollar of program expenditures, we next estimate the CE per program dollar. Among the three categories of payments, \"other payments\" have the highest CE per dollar. This probably reflects the largely counter-cyclical nature of these disaster assistance payment and market loss payments. The CE per dollar for these payments is higher for livestock producers than it is for crop farmers (1.07 versus 1.03), likely reflecting the importance of disaster assistance and market loss payment programs to dairy operations and other livestock producers."}, {"section_title": "Crop insurance", "text": "Because of the way the ARMS questionnaire is designed, it is only possible to examine the riskreducing benefits of net crop insurance payments (indemnity paymentspremiums) for a subset of farms. ARMS asks farmers about their total crop and livestock insurance indemnity payments but only asks farmers about their crop insurance premiumsnot their livestock insurance premiums. Hence, we can only accurately estimate net insurance payments (indemnities minus premiums) for farms with no livestock insurance. To account for this, we focus our analysis on the subsample of operations that are highly specialized in crop production (at least 90% of total sales are from crops). For these highly specialized crop producers (table 11), net crop insurance payments are the second largest source of paymentsabout $8,900 per farm -just slightly larger than the \"other payments\". The CE per dollar of crop insurance payments is 1.29each dollar received from crop insurance is worth $1.29 to the farmer, on average. The benefits per dollar from crop insurance are substantially higher than the other programs because crop insurance is more effective at mitigating farm income risk. For each type of program except crop insurance, a dollar of payments is worth about a dollar to the farmer. This implies that the payments are roughly equivalent in value to a fixed certain payment. However, the payments are worth much more per dollar than farm income. For all farms (column 1, table 10) the average CE per dollar of income is only 0.592 ($104,991/$177,426). In other words, a dollar of farm income is only worth about 60 cents to the farmer because the income is so highly variable."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This study used a newly created panel dataset drawn from the 1996 to 2013 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) to examine how farm income varies over time. The panel dataset allows us to measure how income changed over time for individual farms, and thereby create several measures of temporal income variability. Comparing the variability of farm and non-farm income for crop and livestock farms of different sizes showed that farm income is substantially more variable than non-farm income, and that crop farm income is more volatile than livestock farm income. While farm income risk does not vary substantially across farms of different sizes, total household income risk increases proportionately with farm sizeespecially for crop farms. Larger farms face greater total income volatility because farm income -which is riskier than non-farm income -comprises a greater share of the total income for large farms. While total household income risk is greater for larger farms, income risk relative to assets is actually smaller. In other words, while large farms face more variation in income relative to their average income, they face less variation relative to their assets. This could help explain why large farms generally do not experience a greater probability of farm business failure despite facing more variable income (Key and Roberts, 2006;2007). An examination of average income volatility over time suggests that farm and total income volatility have decreased between 1996 and 2013. This finding was confirmed using a regression analysis that controlled for farm, operator, and regional characteristics. It is possible that the increasing emphasis of Federal farm programs on risk mitigation, including the decade-long expansion of crop insurance programs, has reduced farm income variability and consequently total household income variability. Future work will explore the causes of this apparent trend volatility. This study also examined the extent to which different components of household income (farm income, agricultural payments, non-farm wage income, and other non-farm income) have contributed to, or mitigated, income variation. We find that farm income contributes by far the largest share to total income variationabout 77% for all farms, and up to 90% and 87% for crop and livestock farms with at least $3.0 million of farm assets. We find that for the average farm, there is a negative correlation between net farm income and other sources of income which substantially reduces total income volatility (compared to a situation where the income sources are not correlated). This is strong evidence that the diversification of income sources is an effective strategy for reducing farm household income risk. Finally we examined the effect of different types of government programs on income risk and welfare. We find that all types of agricultural payments (commodity, conservation, crop insurance, or other payments) reduce the coefficient of variation in incomea common measure of income risk. To compare the risk-reducing benefits of these programs, we estimated the certainty equivalent value of the payments per dollar. We find that an expected dollar of commodity, conservation, and other payments are worth about $1.03-$1.07. This indicates that all these programs reduce income risk and provide much higher benefits that an expected dollar of farm income, which we estimate to be worth only $0.60 (in certainty-equivalent terms). We estimate that expected net crop insurance payments (indemnity paymentspremiums) provide the greatest value for farmersworth $1.29 for the average specialized crop farmer.       $42,088 $31,208 $27,665 $27,603 $39,288 $34,408 $31,960 $34,024 Total HHI Median $59,126 $73,576 $103,948 $180,723 $78,542 $109,751 $149,993 $265,648 HH Asst Median $600,469 $1,254,425 $2,297,234 $5,202,371 $657,633 $1,333,948 $2,415,259 $5,115,684 HH Debt Median $59,256 $170,487 $319,082 $780,876 $77,965 $161,204 $296,183 $571,074 Gov.
