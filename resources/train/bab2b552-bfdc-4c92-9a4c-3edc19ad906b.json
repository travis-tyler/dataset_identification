A decline in \u2424-amyloid (A\u2424) levels in the CSF has been reported to help distinguish between patients with AD and elderly individuals without AD. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] In particular, the longer 42amino acid isoform A\u24241-42 in combination with levels of the phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau (p-tau) has been advocated for use in the diagnosis of AD. 8 Perrin and colleagues 9 identified other biomarkers, including neuronal cell adhesion molecule, YKL-40 (YKL represents the first 3 N-terminal amino acids and 40 denotes molecular mass in kilodaltons; also known as human chitin-ase 3-like 1, cartilage glycoprotein 39, and chondrex), chromogranin A, and carnosinase I, which improved the diagnostic accuracy of A\u24241-42 and p-tau. Craig-Schapiro and colleagues 10 used a biomarker discovery method from rules-based medicine (RBM) to identify novel CSF biomarkers that distinguish between very mild dementia, mild dementia, and no dementia.\nCompared with CSF, blood analysis has advantages as an approach to population-based disease screening because it is simpler and less invasive. As such, there has been strong interest in obtaining usable blood-based biomarkers for AD diagnosis. Ray et al 11 identified a panel of 18 biomarkers from a group of 120 signaling proteins and, more recently, O'Bryant and colleagues 12, 13 used a panel from RBM to identify a list of 30 biomarkers to detect AD. Soares and colleagues 14 describe a list of biomarkers identified within the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort in this issue. Herein, we describe a short articulated panel of blood-based biomarker candidates obtained by comparing clinical factors with blood-based measures from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study, a prospective longitudinal cohort study of aging in Australia. 15 This biomarker panel was then validated in the ADNI cohort. The biomarkers identified in this crosssectional analysis of data from the AIBL study may contribute toward the development of a blood-based diagnostic test, which together with appropriate imaging phenotypes may deliver an accurate means to diagnose AD."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "STUDY COHORTS, SAMPLE PREPARATION, AND MULTIPLEX PANEL", "text": "This study refers to initial biomarker screening in 754 healthy individuals serving as controls (HCs) and 207 participants with AD, drawn from the AIBL study. 15 Blood samples were collected from all patients (fasting) on arrival at both Australian sites and were fractionated within 2 hours of collection and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. 15 Full blood pathology testing (Melbourne Health and PathWest Laboratory Medicine) and apolipoprotein E (APOE; OMIM \u03e9107741) genotyping, 16 were performed. The APOE genotype discussed within this article relates to testing all possible APOE genotypes.

All sample results below the lower limit of quantitation were classed as missing data. Plasma A\u24241-40 and A\u24241-42 peptides were measured using a commercial assay (INNO-BIA plasma A\u2424 assay; Innogenetics, Inc) and a well-documented double sandwich enzyme-linked immunoassay technique, 5,17,18 as described previously. 19 Total APOE and APOE4 protein levels were measured in plasma from fasting participants using a commercial assay (APOE4/Pan APOE ELISA; MBL Co, Ltd), as previously described. 20 Total plasma (lithium heparin) metal iron levels were measured by induction-coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Seven metals were measured: chromium (isotopes 52 and 53; Cr), copper (isotope 65; Cu), iron (isotope 57; Fe), rubidium (isotope 85; Rb), selenium (isotope 78; Se), and zinc (isotope 66; Zn).

Comparisons were undertaken between cohorts with respect to HCs, AD cases, and a combined overall grouping. Significant distributional differences were found for age, educational level, APOE genotype, and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score; no significant differences in the distributions of body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) and sex across the 2 cohorts were observed (Table 1) . When the groups were stratified, the proportions of AD participants were very similar for both CDR and APOE genotype, whereas the proportions of HCs for the same demographic variables were significantly different (CDR, P=.0004; APOE genotype, P=.003). On average, the Mini-Mental State Examination score was lower in AIBL AD participants than in ADNI AD participants, whereas HCs in both cohorts had the same Mini-Mental State Examination score. Comparing age between cohorts, the AIBL cohort had a higher proportion of younger (\u03fd70 years) HCs than did the ADNI cohort (35% vs 4%) and also had a higher proportion of older (\u054680 years) participants with AD (68% vs 52%). Healthy controls from the AIBL cohort tended to have more years of education compared with those from the ADNI, and there was a higher proportion of HCs in the ADNI cohort who had a CDR score of 0.5. In addition to the cohort comparisons presented in Table 1 , BMI and educational levels were compared between the AD and HC groups (AIBL sample data).

The protein fold difference between AD patients and HCs was highest for insulinlike growth factor binding protein 2 (IG-FBP2) (1.61-fold). Pancreatic polypeptide was the only other protein that was at least 1.5-fold greater in AD patients compared with HCs (1.54-fold).

The number of biomarkers that were selected by these methods and that were common between the sets is illustrated in Figure 2 . Biomarkers that were selected in at least 2 of 3 methods (21 biomarkers) were subject to statistical analysis pathway 2.

We showed that including demographic and clinical information (educational level and BMI) together with these blood-based biomarkers and adjusting for age, sex, and APOE genotype strengthens the accuracy of disease prediction. The validation analyses using both cohorts demonstrated the strength of the chosen biomarkers. Reducing the number of biomarkers in the signature panel to 8 (B2M, carcinoembryonic antigen, cortisol, epidermal growth factor receptor, IGFBP2 IL-17, PPY, and VCAM1) using the AIBL data reduced the accuracy of the predic-tion by only 2%; the same reduction using the ADNI data as the validation set increased the prediction accuracy over using the full set of 18 biomarkers. Reducing the signature of biomarkers in the diagnostic panel increases its usefulness, initially within the clinical setting and after further validation for population screening. We acknowledge that the differences between the 2 cohorts, such as the reduced number of samples, the ratio of AD patients to HCs, and the differences in age, educational status, CDR score, and APOE \u03b54 allele status, may all play a role in validation accuracy.\nFrom all biomarkers identified, cortisol, IGFBP2, and PPY were the ones most frequently chosen. The elevation of cortisol in AD participants presented herein and its presence as a part of the biomarker signature are in concordance with previously published studies. 25 Moreover, Lupien et al 26 found that prolonged exposure to the adrenal glucocorticoid aligns with reduced hippocampal volume and hippocampus-related memory tasks. Porter and Landfield 27 proposed multiple hypotheses regarding the aging effects of prolonged exposure to adrenal hormones and suggested that the interaction between aging, stress, and glucocorticoids increases vulnerability and cognitive impairment. The effects of chronic glucocorticoid exposure and hippocampal volume in animal models have been summarized by Tata and Anderson. 28 Recently, McAuley et al 29 showed, from an in silico model, a potential 30% to 40% decrease in hippocampal activity with long-term elevated levels of cortisol. They showed that a biological intervention to such a system might reduce the decrease of hippocampal activation by 22%. However, subsequent reports have shown that cortisol is both a putative biomarker, as part of a large panel, for the classification of patients with schizophrenia 30 and is elevated in that population. 31 These data, together with the results from the present study, indicate that further research validating cortisol levels across different neurologic diseases is required to determine its specificity.\nIn addition to the present study on blood-based biomarkers, IGFBP2 was found to be higher in the CSF of individuals with AD in 2 other studies. 32, 33 The second of these studies 33 reported a significant increase in IGFBP2 in both CSF and serum. A more recent study, 10 using the same multiplex panel as in the present study, failed to detect a significant change in IGFBP2 levels in the CSF of patients with AD; however, IGFBP2 was correlated with the levels of CSF tau. To the best of our knowledge, the study of Craig-Schapiro and colleagues 10 has been the only other one to find PPY and IL-17 significantly altered in the CSF of individuals with AD compared with the CSF of HCs.\nDavidsson et al 34 identified B2M along with APOE and others as significantly altered proteins in the CSF of participants with AD compared with healthy controls. Our study showed increased B2M levels among patients with AD compared with controls; B2M is a small component of the major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chain and is involved with membrane turnover and elimination. Furthermore, because there is evidence that B2M is increased in other diseases in which the immune response is elevated, research has suggested that it is a marker of the immunologic state in vivo. 35 To our knowledge, this study is the first to show a relationship between epidermal growth factor receptor and AD. Zhang et al 36 found that the Alzheimer A\u2424 precursor protein intracellular domain (released as a result of \u2425 secretase cleavage) mediated the transcriptional regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor. It is thus possible that in the presence of abnormal A\u2424 amyloid precursor protein there may be a corresponding increase in the transcription of epidermal growth factor receptor and an increase in serum levels of EGFR. Further research focused on the gene expression of EGFR is currently under way to validate this hypothesis.\nCarcinoembryonic antigen has not previously been found to be associated with AD. Carcinoembryonic antigen, like VCAM1, is a cell adhesion molecule and belongs to a large family of immunoglobulins. O'Bryant et al 12 suggested an inflammatory endophenotype of AD from the large proportion of inflammatory markers identified in their study. Our finding of markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen, VCAM1, IL-17, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 \u2423, and B2M is related to immune system functionality and supports the hypothesis that there is an inflammatory endophenotype in AD.\nOur results agree with those of O'Bryant and colleagues 12, 13 in that there is an abundance of inflammatory markers in our findings; however, this may be the result of the high proportion of inflammatory markers in the RBM panel used in both studies by O'Bryant et al 12, 13 and in our study. Certainly, newer RBM biomarker panels have more proteins from multiple pathways represented.\nWe also report considerable overlap with biomarkers identified by Soares and colleagues, 14 in particular with respect to univariate analyses, for which increased lev-els of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), eotaxin 3, matrix metalloproteinase 1, PPY, and tenascin C and decreased levels of IgM and APOE were reported. Furthermore, multivariate analyses identified that APOE and NT-proBNP were of particular importance in contributing to the increased accuracy of the classification of AD. 14 Although we also identified decreased APOE (in biomarker set A), NT-proBNP was not included in the multiplexed panel used in this study; however, its identification in CSF by Craig-Schapiro and colleagues 10 provides evidence of its probable importance in AD. Likewise, there is growing support for the importance of APOE protein levels as a biomarker for disease. 14, 20 We performed rigorous statistical analyses of a large biomarker set from the AIBL study and validated these results using comparable biomarker data from the ADNI study. Using a suite of statistical methods, we found the markers cortisol, PPY, IGFBP2, IL-17, VCAM1, B2M, EGFR, and carcinoembryonic antigen to be part of a bloodbased signature to determine AD. We stress the importance that the biomarkers identified are blood based. Such an improvement in diagnostic predictive power over the base model of age, sex, and APOE \u03b54 allele has identified the combinatorial strength of blood-based markers, in which prior benchmarks are derived from highly sensitive but invasive CSF testing. Selection of these biomarkers after such thorough statistical analysis and validation of these markers using a second cohort provide strong evidence of their importance in AD pathogenesis and, in turn, AD diagnosis. Whether their accuracy can be improved in combination with biomarkers identified in recent studies needs to be determined.
