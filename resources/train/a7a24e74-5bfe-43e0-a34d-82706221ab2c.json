[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Iron deposition in the brain is a prominent feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, peripheral iron measures have also been shown to be associated with AD status. However, it is not known whether these associations are causal: do elevated or depleted iron levels throughout life have an effect on AD risk?\nWe evaluate the effects of peripheral iron on AD risk using a genetic profile score (GPS) approach by testing whether variants affecting iron, transferrin or ferritin levels selected from GWAS meta analysis of approximately 24,000 individuals are also associated with AD risk in an independent case-control cohort (n~10,000). Conversely, we test whether AD risk variants from a GWAS meta analysis of approximately 54,000 account for any variance in iron measures (n~9000).\nWe do not identify a genetic relationship, suggesting that peripheral iron is not causal in the initiation of AD pathology."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Iron is the most abundant metal in the brain, where it is vital for neurotransmitter synthesis, myelination of neurons and energy generation by mitochondria [1] . However excess iron contributes to the generation of reactive oxygen species, and consequent tissue damage [2] . Dysfunctional brain iron homeostasis is believed to play an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) [3] . Iron accumulation is seen in the AD post-mortem brain [4] and iron content correlates with disease duration and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score [5, 6] .\nIndividuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with high risk of AD, showed higher cortical iron in vivo using MRI (measured using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) techniques), which spatially co-localised with A\u03b2 plaques and correlated with higher plaque load [7] . In addition, transferrin (an iron transport protein) and ferritin (an intracellular iron storage protein) are both elevated in AD brain tissue in neurodegenerative regions [8] .\nFerritin levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) negatively correlated with cognitive performance and predicted conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD [9] . Ferritin levels were also associated with CSF apolipoprotein E levels and were elevated by the Alzheimer's risk allele, APOE-\u03b54, suggesting that ferritin may reflect the mechanism by which APOE-\u03b54 is a risk factor for AD.\nIron trafficking across the blood brain barrier is tightly regulated and early studies suggested that the brain is protected from systemic fluctuations in iron, with a lack of correlation between liver and brain iron concentrations post-mortem [10, 11] . Animal studies went on to challenge this view, showing that excess dietary iron increased brain iron levels in specific brain regions [12] . Quantitative MRI studies measuring the proton transverse relaxation rate (R2) now allow iron concentrations to be assessed in the brain in vivo. One such study in cognitively normal elderly men found that iron levels in basal ganglia structures were correlated with serum iron measures [13] . In an investigation in the large Australian Imaging Biomarker and Lifestyle (AIBL) cohort of healthy controls, MCI and AD patients had disturbed brain iron metabolism reflected in the periphery by a decrease in plasma iron and haemoglobin [14] , which was due to a deficiency of iron-loading onto Transferrin [15] .\nSeveral mechanisms have been suggested to cause dysregulation of iron transport across the blood brain barrier in AD including the involvement of amyloid precursor protein (APP) fragments and chronic inflammation [11] . A deficit in brain iron trafficking, which is essential for heme formation, neurotransmitter synthesis, and myelination of axons, could contribute to the pathophysiology of AD. But results are inconsistent, with two meta analyses having differing conclusions on whether differences in circulating iron levels can be detected between AD cases and controls, and reporting heterogeneity between studies [16, 17] .\nIt is clear that iron dysregulation has a role in AD, and that to a limited extent plasma iron might reflect changes in brain iron levels, but there has been little investigation of whether peripheral iron levels over the long term affect risk of AD. Apart from the lack of suitable and adequately powered prospective studies, a limitation of observational studies is the inability to distinguish between causal associations and those due to confounding and reverse causation. A systematic review found that, in a limited number of trials, testing whether depletion or supplementation of iron changed a person's risk of AD provided no conclusive evidence, and that additional studies are necessary [18] .\nDrug development and randomised clinical trials are expensive and take many years to reach fruition, especially for a slowly progressive disease where treatment needs to start early in the disease course. An alternative approach, which overcomes the problem of reverse causation, is Mendelian Randomization (MR). Here the genetic variants affecting the putative causal variable are used as instrumental variables to test for an effect on disease risk. A demonstration that genetic polymorphisms known to modify the phenotype level also modify disease risk provides indirect evidence of a causal association between phenotype and disease. MR analysis has the following assumptions: firstly the genetic variant used is only associated with the risk factor of interest; secondly it is independent of all confounding variables; and finally there is no causal pathway leading from the genetic variant to the disease except through the risk factor of interest. For highly polygenic traits a large number of genetic polymorphisms can be combined to explain a larger proportion of the variance of the trait. The large numbers of variants included means that some are likely to violate the assumptions for a MR analysis. But a lack of association between appropriate SNPs and the outcome, given a dataset large enough to give reasonable power suggests that there is no causal relationship. A shared genetic basis indicates either, pleiotropy where a variant affects multiple traits independently, or a causal relationship between the two correlated traits; with the requirement that any potential confounders must be taken into account. If a shared genetic basis is found then a quantitative MR approach would then be required to compare direct and mediated paths between variants affecting the postulated causal variables and the outcome. This method has been widely used, both confirming and refuting suggested causal relationships based on epidemiological findings [19] . For example, this approach has had significant success in clarifying relationships between lipid levels and ischemic heart disease [20] . In addition a recent study compared 42 traits or diseases with available large GWAS where among other findings the authors found evidence that increased BMI causally increases triglyceride levels [21] .\nMR was recently used to test for an effect of serum iron on Parkinson's Disease (PD) risk, using three genetic variants influencing iron levels (HFE rs1800562, HFE rs1799945, and TMPRSS6 rs855791) [22] . The combined MR estimate showed a statistically significant protective effect of increased serum iron in PD, suggesting that over the course of a life time alteration in tissue iron homeostasis reflected by a decrease in serum iron levels is on the causal pathway in the pathogenesis of PD. Twelve iron associated SNPs identified though GWAS were also used to investigate the role of iron in atherosclerosis, and identified a potential causal role in women [23] .\nSingle genetic variants that influence serum iron levels have not been shown to have a large effect on AD risk. The transferrin genetic variant C2 has been investigated and shown to have a small but significant association (OR=1.11, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.17, in a meta analysis of 19 studies [24] ). Several studies previously reported an increased frequency of the HFE H63D (rs1799945) mutation in AD patients [25] , but these findings have not been replicated in the largest AD GWAS meta analysis [26] . There is evidence of interaction effects, which would not be apparent in GWAS meta analyses, involving H63D and APOE \u03b54 alleles where the combination appears to affect age of onset and, to a lesser extent, risk [27] [28] [29] .\nSince several genes are well characterized for their impact on peripheral iron variation, we sought to determine their combined causal effect on AD risk. We test the effect of a large number of genetic variants affecting the iron-related measures of serum iron concentration, transferrin (the major iron transporter), ferritin (which reflects iron storage in bone marrow) and transferrin saturation (ratio between serum iron and total iron binding capacity) on AD risk, in combination using a genetic profile score (GPS) approach. Variants are selected from an iron GWAS meta analysis discovery cohort [30] (n=23,986) and tested in large independent target AD case-control datasets (n=9,251). In addition we test for the converse scenario, whether those at a high genetic risk for AD have higher peripheral iron levels throughout life, using SNPs identified by the AD GWAS meta analysis discovery cohort [26] (from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project, IGAP n=54,162) in an independent population based target sample with available iron measures (n=8893). Previously an AD polygenic score analysis has shown that disease prediction accuracy is greatest including SNPs with P value <0.5. Including the full polygenic score significantly improved prediction over use of APOE alone where including both APOE and PRS gave AUC=78.2% [31] .\nExamples of the AD PRS based on the IGAP discovery analysis demonstrating genetic overlap with other traits include neuroimaging measures of subcortical brain volumes, plasma C-reactive protein and lipids [32, 33] .\nFinally to confirm our findings using an alternative method we used SNP Effect Concordance Analysis (SECA) with only the discovery datasets, to examine whether SNPs found to be associated with the serum iron measures are enriched within associated SNPs with AD risk, and vice versa."}, {"section_title": "Material and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "The AD case-control cohort comprises the datasets shown in table 1.

Because the analysis is restricted to those SNPs which are most highly associated in dataset 1, we also repeated the analysis with the iron GWAS summary statistics as dataset 1 (in case of a scenario where SNPs strongly affecting iron phenotypes had an effect on AD risk, but SNPs strongly affecting AD risk did not affect iron phenotypes)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Genetic profile score (GPS) analysis", "text": "The discovery GWAS meta analysis datasets used in the study contain large sample sizes (in total 54,162 for AD and 23,986 for serum iron status) and show both AD and serum iron measures to have a strong polygenic components 27, 31 . For serum iron measures using replication cohorts, the lead SNPs at the 11 significant loci explained 3.4, 7.2, 6.7 and 0.9% of the phenotypic variance for iron, transferrin, saturation and (log-transformed) ferritin, respectively [30] . There is large deviation from the expected distribution of association test statistics compared to observed values, with association signals observed far below the level of genome-wide significance (figure 1). Therefore using SNPs below genome-wide significance will increase power to detect an association.\nAssociation analysis conducted in each AD disease case-control data set identified no effect of any serum iron status GPS (serum iron, transferrin, ferritin and transferrin saturation) on AD risk, and the Meta analysis identified no significant between study heterogeneity (Supplementary figure 1) . When combined in a mega analysis no effect of any serum iron status GPS (serum iron, transferrin, ferritin and transferrin saturation) on AD risk was identified with a sample size of 6,381 controls and 2,870 AD cases (Table 3) . Controlling for APOE genotype did not significantly affect the results, and no significant association was identified in separate APOE \u03b54 carrier and non-carrier groups (data not shown). Previously three iron level influencing genetic variants (HFE rs1800562, HFE rs1799945, and TMPRSS6 rs855791) have been shown to be associated with PD risk [22] .

No SNP sets were found to have nominally significant pleiotropy (figure 2). Using Fisher's test we also tested for an excess of SNPs where the effect directions (BETA) are concordant between SNP subsets in each dataset. Again we identified no significant concordance (supplementary figure 2). Additionally no significant pleiotropy or concordant effects were seen when switching the primary dataset, i.e. testing for an excess of SNPs associated with each iron phenotype also associating with AD."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "It is becoming increasingly clear from investigations of iron homeostasis and recent advances in iron imaging methods that iron dysregulation is an important feature of AD, and therefore lowering of iron content in the brain is a potential therapeutic target [39] . But there is limited understanding of the importance of peripheral iron levels in AD risk, and whether prolonged increased or decreased iron levels may be a risk factor for AD. We investigated whether there is a shared genetic basis between AD and peripheral iron levels using a PRS approach. We identified no effect of genetic variants affecting peripheral iron biomarkers (including iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation and ferritin) on AD risk. Nor did we find increased serum iron levels in those who are at increased genetic risk of developing AD, including both APOE \u03b54 carriers and those with a higher load of other common risk variants. In addition, in an investigation of the genetic overlap between AD and each iron measure, we do not find any significant overlap of genetic loci from the results of large-scale GWAS meta analysis studies.\nTaken together, our results suggest that the causes of variation in brain iron that might contribute to AD are distinct from those causing variation in circulating iron (serum iron) or in iron stores in bone marrow or other organs (serum ferritin). Iron retention is complex in different organs, and our current data on peripheral iron measurement cannot exclude causation by other genes that affect iron levels in the brain that are not reflected by serum values. In addition the peripheral iron measurements used are standard clinical pathology measures. Non-standard and possibly more direct measures (such as transferrin saturation using size exclusion chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry) have been shown to be more sensitive to differences in the blood between AD patients and controls [15] .\nIt is also possible that, even if iron is not a primary cause of increase in AD risk, it accumulates after the initiation of cell damage by other mechanisms, and exacerbates it.\nEvidence for this comes from recent work showing that once A\u03b2 forms aggregates they induce iron accumulation [40] . Iron-related therapies could still be relevant for patients who are in the early stages of AD.\nIron accumulation in tissues is a feature of many diseases, and may prove to be causal for some. Our current results for AD are in contrast to previous evidence of a causal association of increased peripheral iron measures with a decreased risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) [22] .\nThe authors hypothesised that low peripheral iron may decrease neuronal iron storage though a reduction in ferritin, resulting in free iron accumulation in the brain. To investigate whether a similar effect exists for AD we tested a larger number of iron-affecting variants against the most recent GWAS meta analysis on AD risk. These explain a larger proportion of the variance and therefore we would expect them to have more power to detect any effect.\nHowever, our analysis has limitations that need to be considered. Firstly, the multi-SNP GPS includes a large number of genetic variants of unknown effect or multiple effects, therefore we cannot rule out that as well as affecting iron levels, some also affect AD risk though other pathways and could potentially do so in opposite directions. To attempt to address this issue we also tested for an effect of three genetic variants (in HFE and TMPRSS6) known to have a direct role in peripheral iron levels and previously shown to have an effect on PD risk [22] , where we also did not find an effect. In addition we cannot rule out the possibility that other genomic variations such as epigenetic dysregulation affect iron levels which are then causal for AD.\nSecondly, as in other complex diseases and phenotypes, discovered genetic variants only represent a small proportion of the variance in both iron levels and AD risk. This study utilizes summary data from the two largest GWAS meta analysis discovery cohorts for both AD and biochemical markers of iron status (total sample sizes of 54,162 and 23,986 respectively [26, 30] ) to compute comprehensive GPS. In addition the GPS were applied to large samples with individual level genotype and phenotype data (For AD cases-control: 2813 AD cases, and 6438 controls (of which 4926 are unscreened for AD, aged 54), and \u22658751 for iron measures). Even so, we cannot rule out a small effect that is not detectable with this sample size.\nThirdly, effects on iron in relevant brain areas may differ from effects on circulating iron or iron in other organs. Previous studies identified an association between iron accumulation in the basal ganglia of elderly men and peripheral iron measures [13] . However, only 9% of the variance of cerebrospinal fluid ferritin can be explained by plasma ferritin [9] , highlighting the separation between these compartments. It is also possible that there are genetic loci more relevant to iron-homeostasis in elderly people, as the sample used to construct the iron phenotypes GPS have a mean age of 47.\nOur results suggest that there is not a causal connection between lifetime peripheral iron measures and increased risk of AD. We did not replicate the previous finding of an effect of HFE SNPs on risk of AD and an epistatic interaction for risk with APOE \u03b54 genotype, but we cannot yet rule out an association of HFE SNPs with AD age of onset or phenotypic interactions [25, 27, 28] .\nIt has been suggested that public recommendations for AD risk reduction should caution the use of iron supplementation for those whom it is not required [18, 41, 42] . Dietary patterns such as a Mediterranean diet and reduced red meat consumption that associate with lower AD risk do tend to have a low iron intake, but also have other unrelated health benefits for example high intake of vegetables and low saturated fat. Consistent with our genetic findings, there is no clear evidence that dietary intervention affecting iron intake alters the risk of AD [18] . More work is needed to assess the effect of iron on the progression (as opposed to the initiation) and age of onset of AD.\nIn conclusion, although iron deposition is an important feature of AD brain tissues, these results suggest that there is not a significant causal relationship between lifetime peripheral iron levels and AD.
