This study examines the effect of number of parents and number of siblings on children's body mass index and risk of obesity.\nWe conducted a secondary data analysis of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study -Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K), which consists of a nationally representative cohort of children who entered kindergarten during 1998-1999. Our analyses included 2 cross-sectional outcomes and 1 longitudinal outcome: body mass index (BMI) calculated from measured height and weight, obesity defined as BMI in the 95th percentile or higher for age and sex, and change in BMI from kindergarten through fifth grade.\nOther things being equal, children living with single mothers were more likely to be obese by fifth grade than were children living with 2 parents (26% vs 22%, P = .05). Children with siblings had lower BMI and were less likely to be obese than children without siblings. We also found that living with a single mother or no siblings was associated with larger increases in BMI from kindergarten through fifth grade.\nChildren from single-mother families and, especially, children with no siblings are at higher risk for obesity than children living with 2 parents and children with siblings. These findings highlight the influential role that families play in childhood obesity. Additionally, they suggest that health care providers should consider the structure of children's families in discussions with families regarding childhood obesity."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "For children, family represents the primary source of social learning, influence, and exposure to and adoption of health habits (1) . Family provides social and interpersonal support that is instrumental in shaping and maintaining children's eating habits and physical activity patterns (1, 2) . Furthermore, physical and compositional characteristics of the family influence family behaviors. One key characteristic is family structure. For example, research suggests that family rules, parental involvement, sibling interactions, and emotional support -all of which are important determinants of health behaviors (1-4) -are integrally linked to family structure.\nMore recently, studies have found that family structure also affects children's health care and physical health outcomes (5, 6) . Studies of childhood immunization have found that mothers who had more children were less likely to bring them for vaccination (7) .

What is known about the influence of family structure on family dynamics (1, 8) suggests that family structure may also affect childhood obesity.\nTraditionally, the term overweight has been applied to children whose body mass index (BMI) is at or above the 95th percentile, on the basis of sex-specific BMI-for-age growth charts (9-13). However, expert committee recommendations (Institute of Medicine and American Academy of Pediatrics) suggest use of the term obesity for children with BMI percentile for age and sex in the 95th percentile or higher to reflect the correlation of high BMI with excess body fat among children and to emphasize the clinical risk of such weight status (14, 15) . The overall risk of becoming an obese adult is 2 to 6 times higher for children with BMI at the 95th percentile or higher (8) , and childhood obesity is associated with increased risk of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease (16) .\nIn this study, we used a nationally representative US dataset that tracks children from kindergarten through fifth grade to examine the effect of family structure -specifically, the number of parents and siblings in the household -on children's BMI and risk of obesity. The findings of this study have implications for health care providers and public health officials concerned about child health and childhood obesity."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data source", "text": "The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study -Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) is conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics using a nationally representative cohort of children who entered kindergarten during 1998-1999.

Sampling was based on a multistage probability sampling design in which counties were selected, then schools, and finally children within schools. The ECLS-K collected information from children, parents, teachers, and schools by using a variety of formats, including face-to-face assessments or interviews, telephone interviews, and questionnaires (26, 27) .

Correspondingly, we defined single-mother families as families in which the child's mother was living with the child but the father was absent. We excluded single-father families because of their small number.\nThe covariates in the models included the following sociodemographic characteristics: indicator variables for the child's age; sex; race/ethnicity, categorized as nonHispanic white (the omitted category), non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, or other; family income, categorized as poor (<1.00 times the federal poverty level -omitted category), low-income (1.00-1.99 times poverty), middle-income (2.00-3.99 times poverty), or high-income (more than 4 times the federal poverty level); mother's education, categorized as high school or less (omitted), high school graduate, some college, or bachelor's degree or higher; and mother's age (at time of child's enrollment in the study), categorized as 24 years or younger (omitted), 25 to 34 years, 35 to 44 years, or 45 years or older. We used the other covariates to capture the child's health at birth: premature birth of more than 2 weeks; birth weight, categorized as less than 2,000 g (omitted), 2,000 to 2,499 g, 2,500 to 2,999 g, 3,000 to 3,499 g, and 3,500 g or more; birth order, categorized as first (omitted), second, or third or higher. We combined birth weight less than 1,500 g with birth weight less than 2,000 g because of the small sample size of very low birth weight children in the ECLS-K cohort (0.9% of the sample had birth weight <1,500 g).\nWe weighted all analyses by using sample weights provided by ECLS-K that reflect the sample design and survey nonresponse, and we adjusted all standard errors for clustering by using the Huber-White sandwich estimator (21, 22) .

Next, we averaged the predictions across all the children in the sample.

The number of parents in the household was not associated with BMI or risk of obesity in kindergarten or third grade, but by fifth grade children from single-mother families (26%, P = .05) were more likely to be obese than their peers from 2-parent families (22%). In every grade we found that children with no siblings had higher BMI and a higher probability of being obese than children with siblings (Table 3) .\nChildren living with no siblings had a larger increase in BMI than children living with siblings. The increase in BMI was 4.7 for children with no siblings; 4.2 for children with 1 sibling (P = .02); 3.8 for children with 2 siblings (P = .01); and 3.7 for children with 3 or more siblings (P = .006) (data not shown).

We found no other mediation effects and no moderation effects."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This is the first US study to link family structure to children's BMI and childhood obesity by using a nationally representative cohort (24) . Previous work has demonstrated that family structure, in addition to being a predictor of educational and developmental outcomes, also affects children's health and health care outcomes (5-7). In this study, we found strong evidence that children who lived with a single mother and especially children who had no siblings were at the greatest risk for childhood obesity. Because of the nature of our study sample, our results are likely to be generalizable to US children from 2-parent or single-mother families.\nThe mechanisms through which family structure affects children's weight may be related to differences across types of families in the amount of time and attention parents can devote to nurturing and providing for their children, and to the nature and extent of interactions among siblings (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) 8, (25) (26) (27) . Single mothers are likely to have fewer resources, including lower availability of time and social supports, to regularly provide homemade meals for themselves and their children. Similarly, single mothers may lack the time or energy to play actively with their children and to encourage physical activities. Parents in 2-parent households may be able to spend more time with their children than single parents (28) .\nWhereas having more siblings has been found to have deleterious effects on other indicators of children's wellbeing, such as cognitive development or educational attainment, we found that having more siblings is associated with lower rates of obesity. Social scientists have observed that additional children in the family may dilute available parental time and resources (26, 27) . Time and resource dilution may reduce the time that parents spend reading to, teaching, or playing with each child, which could affect cognitive development (5, 8, (25) (26) (27) "}, {"section_title": "and may", "text": "The opinions expressed by authors contributing to this journal do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the US Department of Health and Human Services, the Public Health Service, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the authors' affiliated institutions. Use of trade names is for identification only and does not imply endorsement by any of the groups named above.\nmake it harder for parents to attend to their children's health care needs (6, 25, 29) . Time and resource dilution may also lead parents to adopt more convenient routines, such as turning on the television and video games at home, which could result in higher rates of obesity. However, siblings may also serve as a stimulus for child-to-child interactions, cooperative play, or activities that increase the time each child devotes to physical activity. Older siblings may even serve as role models or share the caretaking role with parents. Additional siblings may also decrease the availability of food for each child (thus lowering BMI), particularly for families living in poverty. Studies on the treatment of childhood obesity have demonstrated the roles that parents and family play in children's weight control and behaviors (1, 2, 14) .\nOur study has several limitations. As with any observational study, our findings may be subject to omitted variable bias from unobserved parental or family characteristics. In particular, single mothers may differ from married mothers in their attitudes about family, work, and parenting, and these differences in attitudes may influence a child's home and family environment as well as parent-child relationships. These differences in attitudes could also influence parents' choices regarding food or activity for their children. Second, we did not study singlefather families or other less common family types; thus, our findings cannot be generalized to these families. Third, CDC growth charts and BMI percentiles are based on data collected when BMI-for-age was stable among children, and thus may not accurately depict current distributions of BMI-for-age (19) .\nDespite these limitations, our study sheds new light on the role of families in childhood obesity. Our findings suggest that children are vulnerable to increases in BMI and risk obesity in relation to the makeup of their families. A potential implication is that health care providers who treat children should plan and monitor their care in the context of family circumstances. Policies that provide additional support for single mothers, such as increased family leave time or flexible work hours, may help them to achieve healthier lifestyles for their children. Researchers and advocates should consider intervention and prevention strategies that integrate family dynamics, including the promotion of sibling interactions and collaborative activities. National and local initiatives may be more effective with the provision of additional support for single parents. School-based efforts may consider focusing on the promotion of physical activities among children without siblings. Additional research into the mechanisms underlying these relationships could be helpful in addressing childhood obesity in the United States.
