[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "We used a new method we developed for automated hippocampal segmentation, called the auto context model, to analyze brain MRI scans of 400 subjects from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative. After training the classifier on 21 hand-labeled expert segmentations, we created binary maps of the hippocampus for three age-and sex-matched groups: 100 subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 200 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 100 elderly controls (mean age: 75.84; SD: 6.64). Hippocampal traces were converted to parametric surface meshes and a radial atrophy mapping technique was used to compute average surface models and local statistics of atrophy. Surface-based statistical maps visualized links between regional atrophy and diagnosis (MCI versus controls: P 5 0.008; MCI versus AD: P 5 0.001), mini-mental state exam (MMSE) scores, and global and sum-ofboxes clinical dementia rating scores (CDR; all P < 0.0001, corrected). Right but not left hippocampal atrophy was associated with geriatric depression scores (P 5 0.004, corrected); hippocampal atrophy was not associated with subsequent decline in MMSE and CDR scores, educational level, ApoE genotype, systolic or diastolic blood pressure measures, or homocysteine.

As the disease progresses, there is a relentless decline in memory function, which progresses to impair language, attention, orientation, visuospatial skills, and executive function. Imaging research has focused on detecting the earliest signs of dementia, either by visualizing the characteristic pathology of plaques and neurofibrillary tangles as they accumulate in the living brain [Braskie et al., submitted] or by measuring the resulting neuronal loss observable on brain MRI as cortical and hippocampal atrophy [Thompson and Apostolova 2008, Hampel et al., submitted] .\nAs drug candidates that might slow the progression of Alzheimer's pathology have begun to be developed, the need to develop robust and sensitive imaging methods to quantify progression of Alzheimer's disease has become increasingly important. To this end, the National Institute of Aging and pharmaceutical industry funded the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI), with the goal of developing improved methods based on imaging and other biomarkers, for AD treatment trials. A variety of methods have been used to quantify structural deficits in brain MRI including: region-of-interest measurements (especially of the hippocampus [Frisoni et al., 1999] ), the ''boundary shift integral'' technique which quantifies differences between two successive coregistered 3D MRIs [Fox et al., 2000] , cortical thickness mapping [Burggren et al., 2008; Lerch et al., 2008; Salat et al., 2004; Thompson et al., 2004a] , voxel-based morphometry [Good et al., 2001; Whitwell et al., 2007] , and tensor-based morphometry [Hua et al., 2008; Studholme et al., 2004 Studholme et al., , 2006 Thompson and Apostolova, 2008] .\nBecause of the need to combat the disease before neuronal loss is substantial, scientific interest has also focused on mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a predementia stage that carries a 4-6-fold increased risk of future diagnosis of dementia, relative to the general population [Petersen, 2000; Petersen et al., 1999 Petersen et al., , 2001 . At this stage of the illness, molecular pathology and structural atrophy are most prevalent in the hippocampus and adjacent entorhinal cortex. A common biological marker of disease progression in MCI is morphological change in the hippocampus, assessed using volumetric measures [Jack et al., 1999; Kantarci and Jack, 2003] or by mapping the spatial distribution of atrophy in 3D [Apostolova et al., 2006a,b; Csernansky et al., 1998; Frisoni et al., 2006; Thompson et al., 2004a] .\nParametric surface reconstruction and modeling (hippocampal radial mapping) [Scher et al., 2007b; Thompson et al., 2004a; Xu et al., 2008] visualizes the profile of hippocampal tissue loss in 3D, showing that subregional hippocampal atrophy spreads in a pattern that follows the known trajectory of neurofibrillary tangle dissemination [Becker et al., 2006; Frisoni et al., 2006] . Distinct atrophic profiles have also been associated with those MCI subjects who imminently convert to AD versus those who do not [Apostolova et al., 2006b] , and with other dementias such as Lewy Body and fronto-temporal dementia [Sabattoli et al., 2008] .\nFor all such studies, isolating the hippocampus in a large number of MRI scans is time-consuming, and most studies still rely on manual outlining guided by expert knowledge of the location and shape of each region of interest (ROI) [Apostolova et al., 2006a; Du et al., 2001] . To accelerate epidemiological studies and clinical trials, this process should be automated. Some automated systems have been proposed for hippocampal segmentation [Barnes et al., 2004; Crum et al., 2001; Fischl et al., 2002; Hogan et al., 2000; Powell et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2007; Yushkevich et al., 2006] , but none is yet widely used.\nHere, we use a fully automated segmentation approach that we recently developed [Morra et al., 2008a,b, Morra et al., submitted] , called the auto context model (ACM), which is based on a well-known machine learning approach AdaBoost [Schapire et al., 1998 ]. For an overview of the methodology and validation please refer to an inpress paper located at http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ thompson/PDF/JMorra-MICCAI08.pdf . As ACM can accurately segment the hippocampus, we were interested in using it to assess factors that affect hippocampal morphology in a large database. ACM is a pattern recognition based approach [Duda et al., 2001] , and as such it requires a training set and a testing set. For training, we used 21 hand labeled hippocampi, and we tested the approach on 400 other subjects. All results in this article are only for the 400 testing subjects. After using ACM to segment the hippocampus on our 400 test subjects, we then applied a statistical mapping approach 115  116  117  118  119  120  121  122  123  124  125  126  127  128  129  130  131  132  133  134  135  136  137  138  139  140  141  142  143  144  145  146  147  148  149  150  151  152  153  154  155  156  157  158  159  160  161  162  163  164  165  166  167  168  169  170  171   172  173  174  175  176  177  178  179  180  181  182  183  184  185  186  187  188  189  190  191  192  193  194  195  196  197  198  199  200  201  202  203  204  205  206  207  208  209  210  211  212  213  214  215  216  217  218  219  220  221  222  223  224  225  226  227  228 based on parametric surface meshes Csernansky et al., 1998; Styner et al., 2000; Thompson et al., 2004a; Wang et al., 2007] . We used these statistical maps to answer several biological questions regarding AD. We tested the following hypotheses: (1) that spatial maps would reveal systematic patterns of hippocampal differences between large groups of AD, MCI, and healthy elderly subjects, and factors that affect atrophy; (2) that MCI subjects who deteriorated (and developed) AD during a 1-year follow-up period would show great atrophy than those who did not; and (3) that there would be great hippocampal atrophy in carriers of the ApoE4 (apolipoprotein E4) allele that confers heightened risk for AD [Roses et al., 1995] versus noncarriers. To confirm the clinical relevance of these anatomical measures, we hypothesized that there would be correlations between hippocampal atrophy and several widely used measures of brain function (MiniMental State Exam (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating global scores, and sum-of-boxes scores). We correlated baseline hippocampal atrophy with subsequent clinical decline over a 1-year follow-up period. To examine factors influencing the disease process, we also correlated hippocampal atrophy with depression severity, educational level, cardiovascular measures (systolic and diastolic blood pressure), and serum measures. Finally, to evaluate the statistical power of our mapping methods and provide practical information for users of this technique, we gradually reduced the sample size to determine how many subjects would be required, in future studies, to detect associations between hippocampal atrophy and each of our clinical, behavioral, and genetic measures."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "The ADNI [Mueller et al., 2005a,b] is a large multisite longitudinal MRI and FDG-PET (fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) study of 800 adults, ages 55 to 90, including 200 elderly controls, 400 subjects with mild cognitive impairment, and 200 patients with AD. The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National institute on aging (NIA), the National institute of biomedical imaging and bioengineering (NIBIB), the food and drug administration (FDA), private pharmaceutical companies and nonprofit organizations, as a $60 million, 5-year public-private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials. The Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, M.D., VA Medical Center and University of California, San Francisco.\nAll subjects underwent thorough clinical/cognitive assessment at the time of scan acquisition. As part of each subject's cognitive evaluation, the MMSE was administered to provide a global measure of cognitive status based on evaluation of five cognitive domains [Cockrell and Folstein, 1988; Folstein et al., 1975] ; scores of 24 or less (out of a maximum of 30) are generally consistent with dementia. Two versions of the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) were also used as a measure of dementia severity [Hughes et al., 1982; Morris, 1993] . The global CDR represents the overall level of dementia and a global CDR of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3, respectively, indicate no dementia, very mild, mild, moderate, or severe dementia. The ''sum-of-boxes'' CDR score is the sum of six scores assessing different areas of cognitive function: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. The sum of these scores ranges from 0 (no dementia) to 18 (very severe dementia). Table  T1  I shows the clinical scores and demographic measures for our sample. The elderly normal subjects in our sample had MMSE scores between 26 and 30, a global CDR of 0, a sum-ofboxes CDR between 0 and 0.5, and no other signs of MCI or other forms of dementia. The MCI subjects had MMSE scores ranging from 24 to 30, a global CDR of 0.5, a sumof-boxes CDR score between 0.5 and 5, and mild memory complaints. Memory impairment was assessed via education-adjusted scores on the Wechsler Memory Scale-Logical Memory II [Wechsler, 1987] . All AD patients met NINCDS/ADRDA criteria for probable AD [McKhann et al., 1984] with an MMSE score between 20 and 26, a global CDR between 0.5 and 1, and a sum-of-boxes CDR between 1.0 and 9.0. As such, these subjects would be considered as having mild, but not severe, AD. Detailed exclusion criteria, for example, regarding concurrent use of psychoactive medications, may be found in the ADNI protocol (page 29, http://www.adni-info.org/images/stories/Documentation/adni_protocol_03.02.2005_ss.pdf). Briefly, subjects were excluded if they had any serious neurological disease other than incipient AD, any history of brain lesions or head trauma, or psychoactive medication use (including antidepressants, neuroleptics, chronic anxiolytics or sedative hypnotics, etc.).\nThroughout this article, we show whether or not a linkage exists between hippocampal morphology and different covariates of interest, including diagnosis (normal, MCI, AD), MMSE, global CDR, sum-of-boxes CDR, change (over 1 year) in diagnosis, change in MMSE, change in global CDR, change in sum of boxes CDR, the ApoE genotype, depression severity assessed using the GD (geriatric depression) scale [Yesavage et al., 1982] , systolic and diastolic blood pressure, plasma homocysteine level, and educational level. Based on the available data at the time of writing, only baseline scans were analyzed, to maximize the sample size, but predictions of changes in clinical scores during the year after the baseline scan were also assessed, where available. 229  230  231  232  233  234  235  236  237  238  239  240  241  242  243  244  245  246  247  248  249  250  251  252  253  254  255  256  257  258  259  260  261  262  263  264  265  266  267  268  269  270  271  272  273  274  275  276  277  278  279  280  281  282  283  284  285   286  287  288  289  290  291  292 The study was conducted according to Good Clinical Practice, the Declaration of Helsinki and U.S. 21 CFR Part 50-Protection of Human Subjects, and Part 56-Institutional Review Boards.

The training set consists of a small sample of brain images, representative of the entire dataset, which are manually traced by experts. The testing set is a group of brain images that are to be segmented by the algorithm but have not been used for training the algorithm. Our training set consisted of 21 brain images, from seven healthy elderly individuals, seven individuals with MCI, and seven individuals with AD, and our testing set consisted of 100 healthy individuals, 200 individuals with MCI, and 100 individuals with AD. We chose to train on 21 subjects because this number was sufficient in previous studies that varied the training sample size [Morra et al., submitted] ; smaller training sets degraded segmentation performance. We used 400 testing brains, in three diagnostic groups whose size matched the expected proportions that the final ADNI sample will have, once all the data has been acquired. Each of the three groups (AD, MCI, and controls) was age-and gender-matched as closely as possible as shown in Table I .\nTo visualize the demographics of the dataset used in our experiments, Figure  F1  1 gives an illustration of all subjects in the testing group broken down by age, sex, and diagnosis.

ADNI also collects data at 3.0 T from a subset of subjects, but to avoid having to model field strength effects in this initial study, only 1.5 T images were used. All scans were collected according to the standard ADNI MRI protocol (http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/Research/Cores/ index.shtml). For each subject, two T1-weighted MRI scans were collected using a sagittal 3D MP-RAGE sequence.

Beginning rostrally at the posterior uncus, the hippocampus was outlined with the superior border defined by the alveus, demarcating the amygdala superiorly from the underlying hippocampus, excluding the parahippocampal gyrus medially and its white matter inferiorly. Progressing posteriorly, the head of the hippocampus exhibits its characteristic digitations with its superior and medial border defined by the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle, the lateral border by the transverse (choroidal) fissure, and the inferior border by the hippocampal sulcus. When the hippocampal sulcus is not open, a line was drawn from its indentation to the temporal horn. Ammon's horn takes on its typical appearance at the level of the lateral geniculate through the body of the hippocampus. Measurements at this level include the dentate gyrus, cornu ammonis fields four through one, the subiculum, and the alveus and fimbria. The limit between the subiculum and the transentorhinal cortex of the parahippocampal gyrus was defined by a line from the inferior border of the subiculum to the medial edge of the dentate gyrus as it curves into the hippocampal sulcus. The first section that contains a complete view of the cerebral peduncles is defined as the posterior limit of the hippocampal head. The hippocampal body's posterior limit is defined as the first slice in which all four colliculi are visualized.

Briefly, our algorithm uses a set of expertly hand-labeled segmentations to learn a classification rule for hippocampal versus nonhippocampal regions using a modified AdaBoost method, based on 13,000 features (image intensity, position, image curvatures, image gradients, tissue classification maps of gray/ white matter and CSF, and mean, standard deviation, and Haar filters of size 1 3 1 3 1 to 7 3 7 3 7). Here the training set consisted of 7 age-and sex matched subjects of each of three diagnostic groups (AD, MCI, and normal), yield a total of 21 hand-segmented training images. As all brains have been linearly registered to a standard template, the pointwise summation of all the training masks is used to devise a basic shape before capturing the global shape of the hippocampus. We also included curvature, gradient, mean, standard deviation, and Haar filters of the shape prior as features. During each iteration of ACM-our extension to AdaBoost-the Bayesian posterior distribution of the labeling is fed back in as an input, along with its neighborhood features, as a new feature for AdaBoost to use as a weak learner. In validation studies using a leaveone-out approach and standard overlap and distance error metrics [Morra et al., submitted] , these automated segmentations agreed well with human raters; any differences are comparable to differences between trained human raters; and our error metrics compare favorably with those previously reported for other automated hippocampal segmentations. For this article, we only changed two parameters, relative to the implementation described in [Morra et al., submitted] . First, we used 70 iterations of AdaBoost, an AdaBoost cascade depth of three nodes, and four ACM iterations. These changes were mainly made for speed purposes, as training takes less than 12 h with this formulation (we note that although the training phase is very computer intensive, the segmentation of new hippocampi takes less than a minute per brain). 571  572  573  574  575  576  577  578  579  580  581  582  583  584  585  586  587  588  589  590  591  592  593  594  595  596  597  598  599  600  601  602  603  604  605  606  607  608  609  610  611  612  613  614  615  616  617  618  619  620  621  622  623  624  625  626  627   628  629  630  631  632  633  634  635  636  637  638  639  640  641  642  643  644  645  646  647  648  649  650  651  652  653  654  655  656  657  658  659  660  661  662  663  664  665  666  667  668  669  670  671  672  673  674  675  676  677  678  679  680  681  682  683  684 One problem inherent in any automated segmentation algorithm is how to deal with partial voluming effects. Because the resolution of MRI scans is not sufficient to resolve the exact boundary of the hippocampus, some voxels will contain both hippocampus and a neighboring structure (such as the amygdala or CSF). However, we were not able to cope with these effects because we were focusing on assigning each voxel to a specific tissue class (in the hippocampus or not). If our training set contained probabilities (how much of a given voxel is hippocampus), we could in theory learn a model that incorporates these probabilities, but our training set only consisted of binary labels. One could also derive a post hoc method estimating the volume fraction of hippocampal tissue in partial volumed voxels by removing the thresholding step at the end of our algorithm. Our automated classifier outputs a probability at each voxel (which may be considered as a maximum a posteriori or MAP probability in a Bayesian framework) representing the likelihood that a particular voxel belongs to the hippocampus, and this floating-point value is thresholded. This could be considered as an approximation of the fraction of that voxel containing hippocampal tissue (this obviously only makes sense at the region boundary). If posterior probabilities were retained in the analysis and used for inference, it would require a more in depth study to prove their validity. In other ongoing work [Aganj et al., submitted], we have examined the effects of using a partial volume classification model on cortical thickness segmentation, rather than a binary classification at the voxel level. Even so, in this study, given that we have only binarized data to train with, we did not examine partial voluming effects."}, {"section_title": "Linking Shape and Disease Factors", "text": "After all the hippocampal segmentations had been performed, we correlated hippocampal shape with different disease-related factors using a map-based statistical analysis. To accomplish this, 3D parametric surface models were constructed from each segmentation, and these models were geometrically averaged across subjects within each diagnostic group. This results in 3D average surface maps for each diagnostic group and statistical maps relating morphology to different covariates, such as diagnosis, genotype, clinical scores, future decline, etc. We used a surface averaging approach used in many prior studies [Thompson et al., 2004a] but we also note that there are many other systems under active development by our group and others [Shi et al., 2007; Terriberry et al., 2007; Vaillant and Glaunes, 2005; Wang et al., 2007 ] to establish pointwise correspondence for subcortical surfaces. Some use automatically defined intrinsic geometric landmarks on the subcortical surface to enforce higher-order correspondences across subjects when averaging anatomy across a group.\nTo create a measure of ''radial size'' for each subject's hippocampus, first a medial curve was computed threading through the hippocampus, and the distance from each surface point to this curve was calculated, providing a measure that is sensitive to local atrophy. As in prior work, regressions were performed to assign a P-value to each point on the surface in order to link radial size to different covariates of interest. Finally the P-maps are presented as color coded average subcortical shapes.\nAll our permutation tests are based on measuring the total area of the hippocampus with suprathreshold statistics, after setting the threshold at P < 0.01. To correct for multiple comparisons and assign an overall P-value to each P-map [Nichols and Holmes 2002; Thompson et al., 2003] , permutation tests were used to determine how likely the observed level of significant atrophy (proportion of suprathreshold statistics, with the threshold set at P < 0.01) within each P-map would occur by chance [Thompson et al., 2003 [Thompson et al., , 2004a . The number of permutations N was chosen to be 100,000, to control the standard error SE P of omnibus probability P, which follows a binomial distribution B(N, P) with known standard error [Edgington and Onghena, 2007] . When N 5 8,000, the approximate margin of error (95% confidence interval) for P is around 5% of P; to further improve upon this, we ran 100,000 permutations, with 0.05 chosen as the significance level. We prefer to use the overall extent of the suprathreshold region as we know that atrophy is relatively distributed over the hippocampus, and a set-level inference is more appropriate for detecting diffuse effects with moderate effect sizes at many voxels, rather than focal effects with very high effect size (which would be better detected using a test for peak height in a statistical map).\nWhen reporting permutation test results, one-sided hypothesis testing was used, that is, we only considered statistics in which the AD or MCI group showed greater atrophy than the controls, in line with prior findings. Likewise, the correlations are reported as one-sided hypotheses, that is, statistics are shown in the map where the correlations are in the expected direction, for example, greater atrophy associated with lower MMSE scores, and with higher CDR scores. As a post hoc verification, we also confirmed that the maps in the other direction were indeed null (i.e., they do indeed have null CDFs when evaluated using the FDR method)."}, {"section_title": "False Discovery Rate", "text": "To assess our method's power to establish linkages between morphology and disease, we created cumulative distribution function (CDF) plots of the P-values in our subcortical maps.

As they show the proportion of supra-threshold voxels in a statistical map, for a range of thresholds, these CDF plots offer a measure of the effect size in a statistical map.

Figure  F2 , T2 2 and Table II shows that there is a sequential reduction in volume between AD, MCI, and healthy controls, consistent with many prior studies [Convit et al., 1997] . Figure 2 also illustrates that the right hippocampus is slightly larger than the left, reaching significance in the MCI group, which is also in line with previous studies [Jack et al., 1989; Jessen et al., 2006; Laakso et al., 2000a,b; Pennanen et al., 2004; Ridha et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2003 Wang et al., , 2006 . This shows that the segmentations of the hippocampi from brain MRIs we are working with show the expected profile of volumetric effects with disease progression, and that the segmentation approach is measuring hippocampal volumes accurately enough to differentiate the three diagnostic groups, at least at the group level. Table  T3 III shows strong correlations between hippocampal volume and (1) MMSE score and (2) sum of boxes CDR. Correlations are high (0.30-0.38) when all subjects are pooled, considering the low P-values and the relatively large sample size. Even when the three diagnostic groups are split, MMSE correlations are highest in MCI, and sum of boxes CDR correlations are highest in AD. Also, Table   T4 IV shows the same correlations when controlling for diagnosis, age, and sex. Although the partial correlation values are generally closer to 0, as might be expected when controlling for many variables, the pattern of significance is generally the same. This shows that the detected associations between hippocampal atrophy and MMSE (and sumof-boxes CDR) are not mediated by diagnostic grouping, age, sex, and ApoE status, the associations persist even after adjustment for these other factors."}, {"section_title": "Diagnostic and Clinical Score Differences", "text": "The next test we performed to validate our segmentations is to make significance maps (P-maps) for covariates with known linkages to hippocampal morphology. For example, it is known that regional brain atrophy in AD is linked with diagnosis, MMSE, global CDR, and sum of boxes CDR scores [Hua et al., 2008; Thompson et al., 2004a] . As this is one of the largest studies of AD to date (400 subjects), effects of potentially subtle covariates should be detectable. 799  800  801  802  803  804  805  806  807  808  809  810  811  812  813  814  815  816  817  818  819  820  821  822  823  824  825  826  827  828  829  830  831  832  833  834  835  836  837  838  839  840  841  842  843  844  845  846  847  848  849  850  851  852  853  854  855   856  857  858  859  860  861  862  863  864  865  866  867  868  869  870  871  872  873  874  875  876  877  878  879  880  881  882  883  884  885  886  887  888  889  890  891  892  893  894  895  896  897  898  899  900  901  902  903  904  905  906  907  908  909  910 911 912 Figure  F3 3 shows the P-maps for each pairwise diagnostic comparison (AD/MCI/Normal), and correlations between atrophy and MMSE scores, global CDR, and sum of boxes CDR scores, as the covariates. These results would be anticipated based on previous studies of HP volume in AD; the level of atrophy is strongly associated with diagnosis (with greatest effects for the AD vs. normal comparison), MMSE scores, and CDR scores linkages. The overall significance of these mapping results was confirmed by both the permutation tests of Table VII and the FDR analysis of Figure  F4 4. The MMSE and CDR maps resemble each other in part because in our sample MMSE was relatively highly correlated with global CDR scores (Pearson's r 5 20.694) and sum-of-boxes CDR (r 5 20.594); and, partly by definition, global and sum-of-boxes CDR scores are highly correlated (r 5 0.656).\nAs diagnosis, MMSE scores, and CDR scores correlated with hippocampal atrophy as predicted (Figs. 3, 4 , and F5 5), and because the accuracy of the hippocampal segmentations was satisfactory on independent test data, we went on to explore effects of other more subtle factors that might be associated with atrophy.\nClinical assessments of disease severity (MMSE, CDR) also show associations with morphology that generally have higher effect sizes than categorization based on diagnosis alone. Even so, these maps must be interpreted cautiously, as MMSE and CDR are used to help determine who is control versus MCI versus AD, so significant correlations may simply reflect the diagnostic classification. As such, maps of MMSE effects, for example, are not necessarily revealing regions in which atrophy is selectively associated with MMSE independent of diagnosis, as the possible range of MMSE scores is almost completely determined by diagnosis. We therefore also computed maps of within-group correlations, to assess effects of MMSE, and the two CDR measures (sum-of-boxes and global) within each of the three diagnostic groups as shown by Figure  F6 6 and Table  T5 V. This is a much more challenging effect to detect, as it relies on detecting effects of MMSE within a restricted range.\nIn addition to testing for group differences using univariate statistics, it is also important to adjust for confounding effects of other covariates that might influence the diagnostic and clinical correlations. The best way to do this is to create P-maps while controlling for various other covariates using the general linear model (multiple regression). Figure  F7  7 shows the three diagnostic P-maps and the three clinical score P-maps computed after controlling for effects of age, sex, and ApoE status. The clinical score correlations are also controlled for diagnosis. As shown by the permutation test results from Table  T6 VI, the effects of the primary covariate of interest, in each case, remained significant after controlling for the other covariates, showing the robustness of the associations."}, {"section_title": "Predicting Future Cognitive Decline", "text": "One goal of ADNI is to find measures in brain images that might predict future clinical decline, either for therapeutic planning, or to adjust for factors that influence morphology in future clinical trials. To study this, we correlated hippocampal morphology at baseline with subsequent change, over the following 1 year, in MMSE, global CDR, and sum of boxes CDR scores. Correlation maps were created to identify any regionally specific hippocampal deformations that might predict future clinical decline. Such associations have already been found for volumetric measures [Devanand et al., 2007] and using maps to predict conversion, stability, or recovery from MCI . In our MCI group, 26 out of 200 subjects converted to AD by 1 year after baseline. Fewer than three subjects had other types of conversions (e.g., control to AD), so we only correlated atrophy with a binary variable denoting conversion from MCI to AD versus remaining diagnosed as MCI. Figure  F8  8 shows maps revealing some regions in which atrophy appears to correlate with future outcomes, but these maps were not significant overall after multiple comparisons correction via permutation testing (see Table  T7  VII) . We do not present our FDR analysis of these results, because none crossed the y 5 20x line except at the origin.

Even so, if a more liberal threshold is applied to define the suprathreshold region (P 5 0.05 at each voxel), right hippocampal atrophy was associated with future decline in the sum-of-boxes CDR score (P 5 0.036, corrected). This link requires verification in future samples. No significant correlations were found between baseline atrophy and future conversion from MCI to AD, but this assessment may be underpowered, because only 26 of the 200 MCI subjects had converted 1 year after their baseline scan. However, 1 year may not be enough time to observe drastic effects, and the therapeutic goal is to start AD treatment many years before onset (up to 10 years beforehand).

FDR analysis also showed no correlation. Negative findings have little value in small samples, but our finding of no ApoE4 effect in a sample of 370 subjects suggests that any direct effect of ApoE4 on morphology must be relatively subtle. This lack of an effect could also result from the fact that it has been shown that the effects of ApoE4 diminish with age [Juva et al., 2000] . Because all of our subjects are relatively old, the ApoE4 effects may no longer be present. Also, effects of ApoE4 may be more readily observed in a longitudinal study. Finally, it may be that manual tracing could pick up an ApoE4 effect that automated tracings may miss; even though the automated method is capable of handling 400 scans efficiently, it may be less sensitive than a manual method applied to the same sample if it were feasible to trace all of them.\nIt has been hypothesized that ApoE2 may be a protective allele, guarding against the onset of MCI or AD [Roses et al., 1995] . Even so, we found no appreciable correlation between HP morphology and presence of the ApoE2 allele. In our dataset, only 22 individuals carried the ApoE2 genotype, so its rarity means a statistically significant correspondence would be difficult to observe even in a sample this large."}, {"section_title": "Other Covariates", "text": "We also explored some other covariates previously associated with AD. Higher blood pressure [Skoog et al., 1996] , elevated homocysteine levels [Morris, 2003 ], poorer educational level [Stern et al., 1994] , and measures of clinical depression [Ballmaier et al., 2004 [Ballmaier et al., , 2007 have each been shown to be associated with AD. Therefore, we attempted to detect linkages between these factors and regional hippocampal morphology. Figure  F10  10 shows that there is little evidence of any association between regional HP morphology and blood pressure measures, years of education, and homocysteine levels; none of these maps were significant overall after correction for multiple spatial comparisons. Table VII shows the overall significance of these maps. The only measure that was significantly associated with atrophy was depression scores; an FDR analysis is shown in Figure  F11 11. Greater atrophy of the right hippocampal head was found in those subjects with higher geriatric depression scores (P 5 0.004, corrected), an effect clearly seen in the maps (white colors). The underlying biological explanation for this is not clear, but genotype may be important, because smaller hippocampal volumes in late-onset depression have been linked to the long variant of the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene [Taylor et al., 2005] . One postmortem study showed that the presence of a lifetime history of depression was associated with increases in AD-related neuropathological changes in the hippocampus [Rapp et al., 2006] . Some studies of hippocampal atrophy in elderly depressed subjects have hypothesized that ischemic small-vessel disease in the hippocampus may be implicated in the pathogenesis of elderly depression [Ballmaier et al., 2007] . Even so, the correlation between hippocampal atrophy and depression may be mediated by concomitant atrophy in other limbic regions, such as the anterior cingulate gyrus, where cortical atrophy has been associated with apathy in AD patients ."}, {"section_title": "Reducing the N", "text": "One final avenue that we explored was how many subjects were necessary to detect a statistically significant Figure 4. Cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of significance maps for factors previously associated with hippocampal volumes in AD studies. According to the FDR formulae, the rightmost intersection of the y 5 20x line and the CDF for a significance map, other than the origin, represents the q-value, that is, the highest P-value threshold for which there are at most 5% false positives. When CDFs cross the line y 5 20x at a point other than the origin, there is a significant effect, that is, the map can be thresholded in a way that keeps the proportion of false positives under 5%. If other factors are equal (such as sample size), in general, a larger q-value indicates a more powerful correlation between the covariate and the level of atrophy, in the sense that there is a broader range of statistic thresholds that can be used to limit the rate of false positives to at most 5%. The AD group was powerfully distinguished from controls (blue line) and from MCI (red line), with a q-value of 0.280, which implies that 28.0% of the P-map has significant P-values (less than 0.05), the highest allowable threshold that still controlled the FDR.

Associations with MMSE are weaker than expected (only significant in MCI on the right), perhaps because MMSE was used to help define diagnosis, leading to a very restricted range of MMSE scores in each map. 1255  1256  1257  1258  1259  1260  1261  1262  1263  1264  1265  1266  1267  1268  1269  1270  1271  1272  1273  1274  1275  1276  1277  1278  1279  1280  1281  1282  1283  1284  1285  1286  1287  1288  1289  1290  1291  1292  1293  1294  1295  1296  1297  1298  1299  1300  1301  1302  1303  1304  1305  1306  1307  1308  1309  1310  1311   1312  1313  1314  1315  1316  1317  1318  1319  1320  1321  1322  1323  1324  1325  1326  1327  1328  1329  1330  1331  1332  1333  1334  1335  1336  1337  1338  1339  1340  1341  1342  1343  1344  1345  1346  1347  1348  1349  1350  1351  1352  1353  1354  1355  1356  1357  1358  1359  1360  1361  1362  1363  1364  1365  1366  1367  1368 linkage between diagnosis or clinical scores and morphology. To investigate this, we randomly threw out subjects from our initial sample of 400, yielding groups of size N 5 304, N 5 200, N 5 104, N 5 40, and N 5 24. These numbers were chosen to preserve the 1:2:1 relationship between normal, MCI, and AD sample sizes, while maintaining the gender balance in all groups. All the final sample sizes were therefore multiples of eight, as sets of one normal, two MCI, and one AD subject of each sex (i.e., eight subjects overall) were successively eliminated, to create smaller samples. For each different N, a random number was used to throw out samples; therefore, smaller samples are not necessarily subsets of the larger ones.\nAs shown in Figure  F12 12, reducing the sample size, N, generally decreases the detected effect size, as expected. Clinical assessments of disease severity (MMSE, CDR) also show associations with morphology that generally have higher effect sizes than categorization based on diagnosis alone. This is natural as the clinical assessments are continuous rather than categorical measures. Figure 12 also shows how many subjects are necessary to detect a specific effect reliably (i.e., reject the null hypothesis, if FDR is used to control for multiple comparisons). Forty subjects sufficed to discriminate AD from normal groups and to correlate atrophy with CDR clinical scores (global CDR and sum of boxes CDR). 104 subjects were sufficient to correlate atrophy with MMSE, and 200 and 304 subjects, respectively, were required to distinguish MCI from normal and MCI from AD. In general, more extensive regions of statistical association were detected with larger samples."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "This study is representative of several current research efforts that use automated methods to measure hippocampal atrophy in AD, including large diffeomorphic metric mapping [Csernansky et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2007] , volumetric analysis [Geuze et al., 2005] , and fluid registration [van de Pol et al., 2007] . Clinical measures of disease burden have also been correlated with regional hippocampal atrophy in several surface-based mapping studies of AD and MCI [Apostolova et al., 2006a; Becker et al., 2006; Frisoni et al., 2006] , Lewy body dementia [Sabattoli et al., submitted] and vascular dementia , and of conversion between MCI and AD Apostolova et al., 2006b] .\nFor each surface model, a medial curve was defined as the line traced out by the centroid of the hippocampal boundary [Styner et al., 2005; Thompson et al., 2004a] . The medial curve was defined separately in each individual, before averaging the surfaces. The operations of averaging surfaces and defining the medial curve from a surface are not commutative, because a medial curve derived from an average surface would not be the same as the average of the medial curves derived from each individual. Because we were interested in measuring radial atrophy in each individual, we computed these measures in each subject with reference to their own medial curve, but plotted the resulting statistics on the average surface for the groups being compared.\nOne advantage of using the radial distance measureand computing it in each individual separately-is that it is invariant to overall 3D shifts or translations of the structure. Other methods, such as voxel based morphometry for example, may incorrectly pick up global shifts of the hippocampus as compressions or expansions inside the hippocampus. This is because the nonlinear deformations that register structures across subjects in VBM are spatially regularized (smooth) and may not be precise enough to register the hippocampal boundaries exactly. By contrast, if AD is associated with some shifting of the mean stereotaxic position of the hippocampus, the radial distance measure will not be affected by it, and will only Significance maps for the correlation between hippocampal shape at baseline and subsequent change in clinical scores or diagnosis over the following year, where blue denotes 0.1 or greater. The sample size is smaller for these maps (noted in parentheses for each map), as not all subjects had follow-up scans at the time of this study. For the conversion map, only those who were MCI at baseline and had a one-year follow-up diagnosis were included.\ndetect localized reductions in volume intrinsic to the hippocampus. This also makes the radial atrophy mapping technique somewhat robust to small rotational or translational errors in registering the images across subjects, as the radial distances are always measured with respect to a central line threading down the center of the structure. The radial distance is a reasonable proxy for volumetric loss, mapping its distribution in 3D, but will not be sensitive to some types of volumetric change. As radial atrophy is measured with respect to the medial curve, the distance measure reflects the thickness of the hippocampus in a given section, which may not reflect an overall volume difference. For example, any anterior-to-posterior shortening of the hippocampus would be detected by a volume measure, but the radial distance measure is not sensitive to this type of change-it only measures the radial thickness of the structure relative to a centerline. This may be considered a benefit rather than a limitation, as there are some variations across normal subjects in the anterior-posterior extent of the hippocampus, and these variations will be discounted by the radial mapping approach and will not be a source of confounding variance.\nAlthough an FDR correction for the number of elements in each P-map is performed, no correction for the number of clinical markers is done. Ideally, we should lower our threshold according to Bonferroni principles. However, none of the permutation tests were close to the 0.05 level, so this is not necessary. In a recent study (regarding brain regions other than the hippocampus), we performed a 5-fold cross-validation to assess the predictive power of morphometric measures, for assessing conversion to AD from MCI over a 6 month period, using truly independent subsamples [Zhang et al., submitted] .\nSeveral prior studies used 3D surface-based maps to visualize the profile of hippocampal atrophy in AD and MCI, but they relied almost solely on manual tracing, which is extremely time-intensive. Becker et al. [Becker et al., 2006] found greater hippocampal atrophy in AD versus MCI (in a total of N 5 66 subjects) with greatest differences in the CA1 and subiculum regions. Frisoni et al. [Frisoni et al., 2006] (N 5 68), found greater atrophy in AD versus controls, with the main differences in the CA1 field and parts of the subiculum, with CA2 and CA3 regions relatively spared. Finally, Apostolova et al. [Apostolova et al., 2006a] (N 5 65) found MCI vs. AD differences in CA1 for both hippocampi, and in CA2 and CA3 only on the right.\nAnother approach to automatically relate Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and clinical scores with systematic differences in brain structure on MRI is voxel-based morphometry (VBM). VBM has shown promise in several previous studies, including Chetelat [Chetelat et al., 2005] which tracked gray matter loss in a longitudinal study of 18 MCI patients, Whitwell , who also showed gray matter loss over 3 years in 63 MCI subjects, and Good [Good et al., 2002] compared VBM to ROI analysis and showed that they compare favorably in detecting structural differences in Alzheimer's disease.\nIn our maps, the right hippocampal head shows greater atrophy in MCI versus normal groups; the right hippocampal tail shows atrophy only in the AD-MCI and AD-control comparisons. The finding of right anterior hippocampal atrophy in MCI is consistent with findings by de Toledo-Morrell et al. [De Toledo-Morrell et al., 2000] , who observed that the right entorhinal cortex had greatest atrophy in elderly patients. Some investigators have argued that both the EC and hippocampal formation degenerate before the onset of overt dementia, and that EC volume is a better predictor of conversion .\nCorrelations with symptoms have also been examined using hippocampal maps. Ballmaier et al. [Ballmaier et al., 2007] mapped atrophy of the hippocampal head in depressed versus nondepressed elderly controls. Statistical mapping results, confirmed by permutation testing, showed that regional surface contractions were greater in elderly subjects with late-versus early-onset depression in the anterior aspects of the subiculum, and lateral-posterior aspects of the CA1 subfield in the left hemisphere. Similar studies of patients with Lewy body dementia showed a more restricted pattern of hippocampal atrophy than AD patients at a comparable level of cognitive impairment [Sabattoli et al., 2008] . Hippocampal maps may therefore complement cortical maps in revealing the selective atrophic patterns that characterize different types of dementia.\nWe also aimed to identify regions of hippocampal degeneration that predicted either a change in diagnostic classification or a decline in standard clinical measures of functional decline. Although we correlated atrophy with several measures of subsequent decline, only the 1-year decline in sum-of-boxes CDR scores was close to being 1597  1598  1599  1600  1601  1602  1603  1604  1605  1606  1607  1608  1609  1610  1611  1612  1613  1614  1615  1616  1617  1618  1619  1620  1621  1622  1623  1624  1625  1626  1627  1628  1629  1630  1631  1632  1633  1634  1635  1636  1637  1638  1639  1640  1641  1642  1643  1644  1645  1646  1647  1648  1649  1650  1651  1652  1653   1654  1655  1656  1657  1658  1659  1660  1661  1662  1663  1664  1665  1666  1667  1668  1669  1670  1671  1672  1673  1674  1675  1676  1677  1678  1679  1680  1681  1682  1683  1684  1685  1686  1687  1688  1689  1690  1691  1692  1693  1694  1695  1696  1697  1698  1699  1700  1701  1702  1703  1704  1705  1706  1707  1708  1709  1710 linked with baseline HP atrophy (P 5 0.056; a post hoc test gave P 5 0.036, corrected, but used a less stringent re-thresholding of the data to define suprathreshold statistics). This difficulty in predicting future decline may be due to the shortness of the follow-up interval; other studies also reported difficulties in predicting cognitive decline Figure 9 . Significance maps for ApoE4 as the covariate, with blue being P-values of 0.1 or higher. We ran two tests, first to determine if the ApoE4 allele was linked with hippocampal atrophy in all subjects (including those with AD), and secondly in just the non-AD subjects. None of these maps was significant after permutation testing was used for multiple comparisons correction. Significance maps for other covariates including systolic and diastolic blood pressure, homocysteine levels, years of education, and depression (based on geriatric depression scores), with blue being 0.1 or more. Each map has some areas of significance; however only depression has a correlation with atrophy that is significant after permutation testing (for the right hippocampus).\nr 16 r based on hippocampal volumes alone, especially when concomitant subcortical brain injuries, such as lacunar infarcts were present [Mungas et al., 2002] . By contrast, Apostolova et al. [Apostolova et al., 2006b ] recently used the same surface mapping approach (but based on manual HP segmentation) and predicted subsequent clinical decline in 20 MCI subjects. Over a 2-year follow-up period, six patients developed AD, seven remained stable, and seven improved. Smaller hippocampi and specifically CA1 and subicular involvement were associated with future conversion from MCI to AD, whereas MCI patients who improved and no longer met MCI criteria at follow-up tended to have larger hippocampal volumes and their subiculum and CA1 regions were relatively preserved.\nIn our study, right hippocampal atrophy was associated with depression severity, consistent with several prior studies of elderly depression. In elderly subjects with lateversus early-onset depression, Ballmaier et al. [Ballmaier et al., 2007] found greater HP atrophy in the anterior aspects of the subiculum, and lateral-posterior aspects of the CA1 subfield in the left hemisphere. In that study, hippocampal surface contractions correlated with memory measures in late-onset depressed patients. Our maps and those of Ballmeier et al. [Ballmaier et al., 2007] are consistent with most earlier studies [Bell-McGinty et al., 2002; Hickie et al., 2005; Lloyd et al., 2004; O'Brien et al., 2004; Steffens et al., 2000] , showing smaller hippocampal volumes in elderly depressed patients compared to controls. We detected correlations for only the right HP in this study, consistent with several other reports that have shown differences as being more pronounced for the right than for the left hemisphere [Bell-McGinty et al., 2002; Steffens et al., 2000] .\nNext, we examined other hypothesized correlations between hippocampal morphology and educational level, blood pressure, homocysteine levels, and depression severity. Each of these factors has been associated with AD, but they have not yet been directly linked with hippocampal morphology. Long term high blood pressure has been associated with earlier AD onset [Skoog et al., 1996] , elevated homocysteine levels have been linked with stroke, and to some extent with AD [Morris, 2003] , a lower level of education has been shown to be associated with dementia [Stern et al., 1994] , and depression commonly accompanies AD [Ballmaier et al., 2004 [Ballmaier et al., , 2007 . We showed that a strong linkage is absent in all of these cases except for depression, which has been supported by other studies [Sheline et al., 1996] . Neither ApoE4 nor ApoE2 was linked with morphology, either in those without AD or in the full patient sample, suggesting that it is not a powerful modulator of hippocampal morphology, despite its role as a risk gene for AD that was confirmed to be over expressed in our MCI and AD groups versus the normal controls. The lack of detectable hippocampal differences between ApoE4 groups is also consistent with other cross-sectional MRI studies that used manual tracing of the hippocampus [Jak et al., 2007] .\nFinally, we computed empirically-based estimates of the minimal sample sizes necessary to detect the well-known correlations of hippocampal atrophy with diagnosis and with clinical test scores. When conventional volumetric measures were used, Jack et al. ] estimated Figure 12 . Effects of varying the sample size: CDFs of P-values measuring the effect sizes for correlations between hippocampal atrophy and different covariates, as the sample size, N, decreases. In general, greater effect sizes are shown by CDFs with the most rapid upswings from the origin. In almost all cases, the results based on smaller sample sizes show lower effect sizes than those computed from larger samples. There is not a monotonically increasing relation between ED1 sample size and the height of the CDF computed from the sample, as each sample is the result of random sampling from a population. In general however, as N decreases, the power to detect a given effect is less. The minimal effective sample sizes differ for different effects. Here we found that the more subtle MCI state was difficult to distinguish from either AD or normal aging with fewer than 200-300 subjects overall, but that the four other associations (normal vs. AD, and correlations between atrophy and MMSE scores, global CDR scores, and sum of boxes CDR scores) only required 40 subjects to detect (24 was not sufficient). This finding was unexpected; prior studies, based on manual tracings, required far fewer subjects to differentiate MCI from AD and from controls [Apostolova et al., 2006a] . The manual segmentations previously used may have produced more accurate hippocampal models, but they were time consuming to create (often taking several weeks or months, making large-scale analyses difficult or prohibitive). In our current study, our automated approach greatly reduced our segmentation time for a large sample (requiring less than 1 min of CPU time on a desktop computer). Whether or not this approach would be optimal for very small studies remains to be proven, as the improvement in automation versus the need to trace a small training set of around 20 images may become limiting in very small samples. Another factor that may have led to our higher sample size requirements for group differentiation is that ADNI collects scans at many acquisition sites. Even so, major efforts have been devoted to protocol design and calibration across scanners and sites.\nIn future, we plan to map the progression of hippocampal atrophy over time, once the follow-up (longitudinal) scans are available for the full ADNI sample. Morphometric correlates of disease progression may be easier to examine with longitudinal imaging data. A further avenue of work will apply this method to help distinguish neurodegenerative patterns between AD other types of dementia. In our recent studies of Lewy body dementia [Sabattoli et al., submitted] and vascular dementia , we found a more restricted pattern of hippocampal atrophy than AD patients at a comparable level of cognitive impairment."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "Data used in preparing this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database (www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI).
