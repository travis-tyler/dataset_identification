It has been shown to be expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems, and able to cross the blood-brain barrier in both directions [3] . BDNF has been reported to have critical roles in the survival, growth, maintenance, and death of central and peripheral neurons, and is also present in systemic circulation [4] .\nConsiderable evidence has been presented showing that BDNF has essential roles in energy homeostasis [5] . Heterozygous BDNF deficiency in mice results in hyperphagia and obesity [6] , while peripheral injection of the factor is anorexigenic [7] . Moreover, severe hyperphagia and obesity develop in individuals with BDNF haploinsufficiency, or a missense mutation of the TrkB gene in human [8, 9] . Besides roles in energy homeostasis, BDNF appears to be essential for regulation of the cardiovascular system as it is involved in development and survival of the arterial baroreceptor system [10, 11] , and injection into the rostral ventrolateral medulla increases arterial blood pressure [12] . Furthermore, this factor was recently reported to have important protective roles against atherosclerotic plaque instability [13] and cardiac dysfunction [14] . Plasma BDNF levels are known to increase as a result of neural signals after myocardial infarction and its up-regulation appears to be critical to protect the myocardium against ischemic injury [14] . Thus, BDNF has attracted considerable attention as a key factor linking neuronal and cardiovascular regulation.\nIn spite of accumulated findings from animal studies, evidence for the significance of plasma BDNF level in the human cardiovascular system is quite limited. BDNF expression was found to be significantly increased in atherosclerotic coronary arteries, as compared to non-atherosclerotic coronary arteries from control subjects [13] . One study has shown that plasma BDNF levels are decreased in patients with acute coronary syndromes [15] . Recently, plasma BDNF levels were measured in a cohort of healthy subjects enrolled in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) and found to be correlated with blood pressures [16] . These basic and clinical findings of BDNF led us to examine plasma BDNF in relation to diurnal and nocturnal changes in blood pressure (BP) [17] , as well as cardiac autonomic function determined by heart rate variability (HRV).\nIn healthy subjects, BP falls by 10% to 20% during sleep as compared to awake. However, there are several abnormal nocturnal BP fall patterns, with affected individuals classified as extreme-dippers if the fall is $20%, non-dippers if the fall is $0% but ,10%, and reverse-dippers if the fall is ,0% [18] . Previous studies have shown that non-and reverse-dippers with nocturnal hypertension are associated with elevated risk for cardiovascular diseases including stroke and mortality [18] . As a potential mechanism of nocturnal hypertension, dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system may mediate the influences of stress, sleep disorders, and deterioration of the endocrine system [19] [20] [21] . In the present study, the mutual relationships among plasma BDNF, HRV, as a measure of cardiac autonomic function, and nocturnal BP changes (extreme-dipper, dipper, non-dipper, reverse-dipper) were examined in 250 patients with cardiovascular risk factors."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study design and participants", "text": "This cross-sectional study was conducted from October 2010 to November 2012 and included 250 registered patients who were part of the Hyogo Sleep Cardio-Autonomic Atherosclerosis (HSCAA) Study, which was designed to examine the impacts of sleep, autonomic imbalance, and subclinical atherosclerosis on cardiovascular events.

The latter 24-hour recorded time series of data was analyzed using MemCalc Chiram 3, version 2.0 (Suwa Trust, Tokyo, Japan). Ectopic beats, noisy data, and artifacts were manually corrected or excluded from the calculations. According to the recommendations for clinical use of HRV [29] , the standard deviation of the NN(RR) interval (SDNN), the standard deviation of the average NN(RR) intervals for each 5-minute (SDANN5), and the coefficient of variation R-R interval (CVRR) within the time domain were calculated. SDNN and CVRR were considered to reflect all cyclic components responsible for variability in heart rate [29] .

Within the frequency domain, values for low frequency (LF; 0.04-0.15 Hz) and high frequency (HF; 0.15-0.4 Hz) power, as well as the ratio of LF to HF (LF/HF) were analyzed by the power spectrum method. Frequency domain analyses contributed to understanding of the autonomic background of the RR interval and power spectrum analysis provided information regarding how power is distributed as a function of frequency.

Age was significantly different among the 4 groups, which is in accordance with a previous report [18] . In contrast, other cardiovascular risk factors including gender, smoking, co-morbid conditions (dyslipidemia, diabetes, past cardiovascular diseases) were not statistically significant among the groups, which has been commonly observed in other cohorts [19] [20] [21] . Sleep SBP and DBP were significantly higher in the non-(P,0.001) and reverse-dippers (P,0.001) as compared to the dippers, while awake DBP was significantly lower in the reverse-dippers (P = 0.009) than the dippers.\nPlasma ln(BDNF) levels in the 4 groups are shown in Figure 1  (reverse-dippers, 7 .1860.69, p,0.001; non-dippers, 7.7160.86 pg/ml; Figure 1 .

Plasma BDNF was significantly lower in the reversedippers than the dippers (P,0.001). To determine whether plasma BDNF was independently associated with the reverse-dippers, multiple logistic regression analyses were performed using age, gender, classical cardiovascular risk factors (body mass index, current smoking, cardiovascular disease history, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, eGFR), medical hypertension treatment (calcium-channel blocker, a or b blocker, ACE inhibitor or ARB, diuretic agent), AHI and BDNF as covariates (Table 2) . Although the level of plasma BDNF was not associated with the non-dippers, it was the sole independent factor and significantly associated with the reversedippers when compared with the dippers (as a control). Plasma BDNF level tended to correlate with nocturnal BP fall (r = 0.114, P = 0.072), with the relationship becoming significant when extremedippers were excluded from analysis (r = 0.193, P = 0.003). Plasma BDNF was not significantly associated with the awake (r = 0.028, P = 0.667) or sleep (r = 20.091, P = 0.168) SBP values. In the present cohort, plasma BDNF level was not significantly correlated with age, gender, BMI, smoking status, history of cardiovascular diseases, presence of dyslipidemia, hypertension or diabetes (data not shown).\nTo examine the potential involvement of autonomic function in the relationship between BDNF and reverse-dippers, we next examined the associations between BDNF and HRV parameters (Table 3) . Simple regression analyses showed that plasma BDNF levels were significantly associated with all of the time-domain measurements of HRV (SDNN, SDANN5, CVRR), and the frequency-domain measurements LF and HF. Moreover, all timedomain HRV parameters and LF were significantly (p,0.05) correlated with nocturnal SBP fall in simple regression analysis findings (SDNN: r = 0.140,SDANN5: r = 0.138, CVRR: r = 0.163, LF: r = 0.201). Furthermore, the relationships of SDNN (b = 0.143), CVRR (b = 0.166), and LF (b = 0.201) with nocturnal BP fall remained significant even after adjusted for covariates including age, gender, BMI, smoking, history of cardiovascular diseases, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, eGFR, hypertension treatments, and AHI. Finally, we examined the impact of inclusion of HRV parameters in the reverse-dippers using multiple logistic regression analyses. The relationship between plasma BDNF and the reverse-dippers was still significant or borderline significant even with ln(SDNN), ln(SDANN5), ln(CVRR), or ln(LF) included as a covariate (Table 4 ). In this model, ln(LF) was significantly associated with the reverse-dippers and independent of plasma BDNF level. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed. The covariates included age, male sex, classical cardiovascular risk factors (body mass index, current smoking, cardiovascular disease history, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, eGFR), medical hypertension treatment (calcium-channel blocker, a or b blocker, ACE inhibitor or ARB, diuretic agent), AHI and BDNF.

In this study, we focused on the relationships among plasma BDNF, cardiac autonomic function, and dipping patterns of nocturnal blood pressure in a cohort composed of 250 patients with cardiovascular risk factor(s).\nIn our study, plasma BDNF level was the highest in the dippers, lowest in the reverse-dippers, and intermediate in the non-dippers, with those in the reverse-dippers significantly lower as compared to the dippers. Thus, higher plasma BDNF indicated a greater fall in nocturnal BP in those 3 groups. Indeed, plasma BDNF level was shown to be significantly correlated with nocturnal BP fall in those patients. On the other hand, plasma BDNF level tended to be lower in the extreme dippers, who had the largest nocturnal BP falls, as compared to the dippers. Although it is not clear at present why the extreme dippers did not have a trend for an association between plasma BDNF and nocturnal BP fall, Grassi et al. [32] suggested that contributions of the autonomic nervous system and baroreflex changes in extreme dippers may be distinct from reverse dippers with nocturnal hypertension. Previously, Golden E et al. showed that plasma BDNF level was positively correlated with DBP in 496 healthy middle-age and elderly subjects [16] . In contrast, we did not find a significant relationship of plasma BDNF with ambulatory awake or sleep BP levels. This lack of correlation might have been because of differences in BP measurements, casual or ABPM, or differences in the subjects, as the present enrolled patients had one or more cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, and some were receiving treatment with medication. The present findings suggest that nocturnal change in blood pressure, rather than blood pressure itself, is more associated with plasma BDNF, while other clinical parameters including cardiovascular risk factors barely correlate with plasma BDNF.\nAt present, it is not clear how plasma BDNF level is correlated with nocturnal BP changes in humans, though it may reflect the content of BDNF in the central or peripheral nervous system. In a study of rodents, the cortical level of BDNF was correlated with circulating BDNF concentration [33] , while another study showed that BDNF concentration in plasma was unrelated to levels found in the cortex and hippocampus [34] . In cultured rodent myocytes, BDNF at a concentration of 100 ng/ml readily exerted its action [35] , suggesting the alternative possibility of direct action of circulating BDNF. Another intriguing possibility is that plasma BDNF level oscillates overnight and could correlate with nocturnal BP changes. However, no known studies have reported normal circadian control of plasma BDNF. Our preliminary results (n = 4) showed that plasma BDNF level at 23:00, 1:00, 3:00, 5:00 and 8:00 was 2260.26828. 4, 1913.26983.3, 2907.461233.6, 2889 .561438.5, and 26386611.3 pg/ml, respectively, not indi- cated a dramatic oscillation. Thus, it may be feasible to speculate that plasma BDNF sets a threshold for sympathetic neurotransmitter release [35] , in contrast to direct bursts to regulate autonomic tonus. Based on animal experiments, BDNF appears to play fundamental roles in regulation of the autonomic nervous system. In the present study, we showed for the first time that plasma BDNF in humans is significantly associated with several parameters of HRV representing cardiac autonomic functions. In rodents, BDNF and its receptor TrkB were found to be highly expressed in the nucleus tractus solitarius and microinjection of BDNF into the nucleus increased nerve activity, while microinjection of K252a (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor) as well as immuno-neutralization of endogenous BDNF with anti-BDNF antibody decreased nerve activity. BDNF was also shown to be involved in development and survival of the arterial baroreceptor system [36] . In a rat model, BDNF was identified as a candidate molecule for the mediator of activitydependent changes at baroafferent synapses during hypertension [11] , while it has also been shown to quickly alter the neurotransmitter release properties of sympathetic neuron-myocyte connections in rodent cell cultures, leading to a rapid shift from excitatory to inhibitory cholinergic transmission in response to neuronal stimulation [35] .\nOur findings regarding the relationship between plasma BDNF and HRV parameters suggest evidence for the role of BDNF in regulation of autonomic nervous system, and also suggest that the autonomic nervous system mediates the association between BDNF and the reverse dipper pattern. Sympathetic activation appears to represent a mechanism potentially responsible for daynight BP changes [19, 21] . In our cohort, many of the HRV parameters, including SDNN, SDANN5, CVRR, and LF, were significantly associated with nocturnal SBP fall. A previous limited study also found a relationship between HRV parameters and the nocturnal BP patterns. Takagi et al. [20] investigated the relationship among 24-hour, nighttime, and daytime LF and HF components using spectral analyses in patients with hypertension, and reported that 24-hour and daytime LF/HF and LF were significantly lower in reverse-dippers as compared to dippers, even though the time-domain parameters of HRV were not included in their analyses. As shown in Table 2 , plasma BDNF was the sole significant factor associated with the reverse-dippers in our multiple logistic regression analysis that included age, gender, classical cardiovascular risk factors, medical hypertension treatments, and AHI as covariates. Among the covariates, age was one of the strongest determinants for decreases in HRV parameters, as previously reported [37] . Diabetes [38] , chronic kidney disease [39] , and sleep disorders [40] have also been shown to be related to autonomic dysfunction. Importantly, the association between plasma BDNF and the reverse-dippers was rather weakened, yet remained significant or borderline significant even after further adjustment for all HRV parameters (SDNN, SDANN5, CVRR, LF) which were significantly associated with plasma BDNF in simple regression analyses. Thus, unveiled mechanisms may still exist for the relationship between plasma BDNF and reversedippers, except for the role of autonomic nervous dysfunction in sleep BP fall.\nThe present study has several limitations. First, because of ethical considerations, our subjects were analyzed for patterns of nocturnal blood pressure changes without discontinuation of antihypertensive medication, which is generally performed for ABPM measurements in a healthy population. Second, day-to-day BP measurements might be very much variables, since CV for measuring nocturnal BP changes for 2 consecutive days was relatively high (21.2%), while change in the patterns of dipping of nocturnal BP may also be variable. Thus in this study, to minimize the influence of day-to-day variations, ABPM and HRV were simultaneously measured, with plasma BDNF measured during the corresponding morning. Third, diabetic neuropathy was not included as a covariate in this study, because quantitative nerve conduction velocity were not measured in all of the diabetic subjects. Diabetes neuropathy has been shown to be associated with nocturnal hypertension [41] . Fourth, because of the study design, the potential nocturnal oscillation of plasma BDNF was not considered in this cohort study. Finally, frequency-domain measurements of HRV with spectral analyses of non-stationary ECG recording may be affected by noise sources [29] , and day-today variations can be very large. However, both time-and frequency-domain measurements of HRV showed similar results in our cohort, suggesting a contribution of cardiac autonomic function.\nRegardless of these potential limitations, our findings are the first to show a mutual relationship among BDNF, the autonomic nervous system, and reverse-dippers of nocturnal hypertension, and provide an important first step to answer pressing pathophysiological questions in regard to hypertension."}]
