[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Maintenance of telomeres is essential for preserving T cell proliferative responses yet the precise role of telomerase in human T cell differentiation, function, and aging is not fully understood. Here we analyzed human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression and telomerase activity in six T cell subsets from 111 human adults and found that levels of hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity had an ordered decrease from na\u00efve (T N ) to central memory (T CM ) to effector memory (T EM ) cells and were higher in CD4 + than their corresponding CD8 + subsets. This differentiation-related reduction of hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity was preserved after activation. Furthermore, the levels of hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity were positively correlated with the degree of activation-induced proliferation and survival of T cells in vitro. Partial knockdown of hTERT by an anti-sense oligo in na\u00efve CD4 + cells led to a modest but significant reduction of cell proliferation. Finally, we found that activation-induced levels of telomerase activity in CD4 + T N and T CM cells were significantly lower in old than in young subjects. These findings reveal that hTERT/telomerase expression progressively declines during T cell differentiation and age-associated reduction of activation-induced expression of hTERT/telomerase mainly affects na\u00efve CD4 + T cells and suggest that enhancing telomerase activity could be a strategy to improve T cell function in the elderly."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "T cell differentiation is an essential process for establishing long lasting immunity. During this process, na\u00efve T cells differentiate into effector cells to combat pathogens and become memory T cells for long term protection (1) . As a consequence of differentiation, T cells acquire distinct, and specialized functions in each specific subset of differentiated T cells (2, 3) . Human CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in peripheral blood are composed of mainly naive (T N ), central (T CM ), and effector (T EM ) memory T cells as defined by cell surface expression of CD62L/CCR7 and CD45RA (4) . T CM and T EM are two major types of memory T cells and some evidence suggests that T CM can further differentiate to become T EM in response to antigen and cytokines (5, 6) . Recent transcriptome analyses reveal distinct gene expression changes associated with human T cell differentiation and their functional specialization (7) (8) (9) . In contrast to welldocumented gain of function during T cell differentiation, loss of function during T cell differentiation has not been fully characterized.\nHuman telomerase enzyme consists of two core components: human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and telomerase RNA template (hTERC) (10) . hTERT is a rate-limiting component of telomerase and is regulated at several levels of transcription, post-transcription (alternative splicing), and post-translational modifications (11, 12) . Unlike most mature somatic cells that do not express telomerase, lymphocytes have the ability to regulate telomerase expression during lineage development and activation (13) . Freshly isolated resting human T cells express hTERT mRNA but little to no telomerase activity (14) (15) (16) . Explanations for this hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity discordance include a requirement for post-translational modifications of hTERT for telomerase activity (17) or the exclusive presence of alternatively spliced products (ASP) of hTERT in resting T cells (18) which results in loss of hTERT function (19) . After activation, T cells rapidly upregulate hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity to ensure robust cell division and differentiation (20) . Furthermore, increased telomerase expression extends the replicative lifespan of T cells (21) . However, the extent of hTERT ASP expression in human resting and activated T cells and their role in T cell differentiation and aging have not been fully characterized.\nLoss of telomere length during T cell differentiation has long been recognized, as human T N cells have longer average telomere lengths, greater in vitro proliferative capacity, and higher hTERT mRNA level than memory T cells (22) (23) (24) . Within the memory compartment, T CM cells have greater proliferative capacity, and telomere length than those of T EM cells (4) . These observations suggest that T cell differentiation leads to telomere shortening and reduced cell proliferative potential. But it has not been determined whether hTERT/telomerase is also altered during CD4 + and CD8 + T cell differentiation from T N to T CM to T EM and whether regulation of hTERT/telomerase differs in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells.\nAging has a detrimental impact on T cell generation and function (25, 26) . In vitro long term culture of primary human T cells shows reduced telomere length and reduced levels of hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity (20, 24) . In vivo telomere length attrition in T cells with age has also been reported (27, 28) . T cells with shorter telomeres are not only a biomarker of T cell aging, but also associated with reduced T cell proliferation (29) . Furthermore, reduced telomerase activity in T and B cells with age has been reported (30) . In addition, hTERT expression has been positively associated with an increase in influenza-specific memory B cells in response to influenza vaccination in the elderly (31) . Collectively, these findings suggest that age affects telomere maintenance and telomerase expression in lymphocytes. But whether the agerelated decline in telomerase expression affects all or selected subsets of T cells in vivo and whether it is due to reduced hTERT expression or other post-transcriptional mechanisms are currently unknown.\nTo understand the role of hTERT/telomerase in T cell differentiation and aging, we measured levels of total hTERT mRNA and ASPs, and telomerase activity in freshly isolated as well as in vitro stimulated CD4 + and CD8 + T N , T CM , and T EM cells from 111 human subjects (aged from 17 to 85 years old). We report a differentiation dependent decline in hTERT mRNA expression (both full-length and alternative splicing products) and telomerase activity that correlated with their in vitro cell proliferative capacity and viability after stimulation. Furthermore, we showed knockdown of hTERT mRNA with an antisense oligo modestly reduced telomerase activity and resulted in decreased proliferation of activated CD4 + T N cells. Finally, we found that CD4 + T N and T CM cells exhibited an aged-related reduction in activation-induced telomerase activity. Taken together, our results show that T cell differentiation is associated with progressively reduced hTERT expression and telomerase activity, resulting in reductions in cellular proliferative capacity and viability that are further compounded by aging."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Isolation of Six T Cell Subsets From Human Subjects", "text": "Blood was collected from apheresis packs or buffy coats from healthy human adults from the NIA clinic and NIH blood bank under IRB approved protocols.

Significant upregulation of hTERT mRNA (total, FL, and \u03b2 of ASP) was observed in all six T cell subsets after in vitro stimulation and the differentiation-related reduction of hTERT mRNA levels were retained as in resting T cells (Figure 1C) . Noticeably, the ratio of FL and ASPs of hTERT remains mostly unchanged from resting to activated T cell subsets ( Figure 1C and Table S3 ), suggesting that ASP of hTERT is pegged to the total amount of hTERT mRNA not to T cell differentiation. Next, we wanted to determine whether the different levels of hTERT mRNA are linked to the levels of telomerase enzymatic activity in these T cells. We found that the levels of telomerase activity in activated T cells displayed the same order as hTERT mRNA levels in activated T cell subsets, namely, the highest level of telomerase activity was found in activated CD4 + T N cells and the lowest in activated CD8 + T EM ( Figure 1D ) and indeed the levels of hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity was positively correlated in a linear fashion (Figure 1E) .

We found that CD4 + T N cells had the most cell divisions and highest percentage of live cells whereas CD8 + T EM cells had the fewest cell divisions and lowest percentages of live cells among six subsets of T cells (Figures 2A,B) . In addition, CD4 + T N cells from 43% of subjects (3 of 7 donors) had more live cells (viable cells >50%) at the end of the 15-day culture compared to CD8 + T EM cells from 0% of subjects had a similar percentage of live cells at the end of 15-day culture ( Figure 2C) .

Furthermore, we found that hTERT-AS treated CD4 + T N cells had a modest reduction in live cells and also a modest increase of early apoptotic cells compared to control treated cells ( Figure 3E) . We also examined whether knockdown of hTERT expression would affect the growth cytokine IL2 and found a minor decrease of IL2 mRNA under knockdown conditions of some subjects but the difference was not statistically significant ( Figure S4) . Thus, these results demonstrated that hTERT/telomerase enhances activation-induced proliferation and reduces activation-induced apoptosis of CD4 + T N cells. Age Reduces hTERT mRNA and Telomerase Activity in Activated CD4 + T N and T CM Cells\nOur previous study showed that activation induced telomerase activity in T cells was reduced in old compared to young human subjects (30) . However, it was not known whether this change was a result of reduced hTERT mRNA or other mechanisms post hTERT expression nor whether reduced telomerase activity occurred in all or selected T cell subsets in the old. To address these questions, we compared hTERT mRNA levels and induced telomerase activity between young (\u226440 years) and old (\u226568 years) human subjects. We found that young subjects did not have higher hTERT mRNA (total, FL, and ASP) in resting T cell subsets than did old subjects ( Figure 4A and Figure S5 ). After activation in vitro, the hTERT mRNA in CD4 + T N cells was significantly higher in young than in old subjects, but this was reversed in CD8 + T EM cells which had significantly higher hTERT mRNA in old than in young subjects ( Figure 4B ).\nComparing activation-induced telomerase activity, we found that activated CD4 + T N and CD8 + T EM cells had significantly higher telomerase activity in parallel with their hTERT mRNA changes ( Figure 4C) . As the levels of telomerase activity in CD8 + T EM cells were orders of magnitude lower than that of CD4 + T N cells, the impact of such a change on telomerase activity of total T cells was negligible. Strikingly, CD4 + T CM cells also had significantly higher induced telomerase activity from young than from old subjects without a significant difference in hTERT mRNA levels, suggesting age impairs telomerase expression in T cells of old subjects not only at hTERT mRNA but also subsequent levels. To further determine whether the difference in hTERT/telomerase expression between young and old subjects was correlated with cell growth, we found similar numbers of harvested CD4 + T N and T CM cells after stimulation between young and old subjects ( Figure 4D) . Together, these findings demonstrated that the age-associated reduction of activationinduced telomerase activity affect mainly in CD4 + T N and T CM cells which does not appear to be related to their activationinduced growth. "}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Tight developmental regulation of hTERT/telomerase expression in most normal somatic cells is considered an essential step for preventing uncontrolled growth of differentiated cells (19) .\nOur findings here show that hTERT/telomerase expression is also tightly regulated during differentiation of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells from na\u00efve to memory cells. As T cell differentiation leads to clonal expansion of selected T cells, limiting telomerase expression in these cells could also be a protective measure for limiting uncontrolled or unwanted T cell clonal expansion that takes away space and resources from other T cells which will be detrimental to the host. This differentiation-coupled regulation is also operating at the level of hTERT transcription with unique features: FL hTERT mRNA is present in resting CD4 + and CD8 + T cells without measurable telomerase activity and activation upregulates both hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity in T cells. Interestingly, hTERT ASPs are also detected in both resting and activated T cells but their amounts relative to the FL hTERT remain stable indicating alternative splicing of hTERT is related to the total amount of hTERT mRNA but not T cell differentiation. Furthermore, the level of hTERT/telomerase expression is positively correlated with activation-induced proliferation and cell survival of all six subsets of T cells in response to in vitro activation and reducing hTERT levels results in reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis. Collectively, our findings reveal a differentiation-associated progressive decrease in hTERT/telomerase expression in human T cells, which in turn reduces the capacity of activation-induced T cell proliferation.\nPrevious studies have shown that resting human T cells from blood exhibit low to undetectable levels of telomerase activity despite the presence of hTERT mRNA (14-16). Jalink et al. analyzed a limited number of human subjects (n = 6) and showed that only the \u03b2 ASP, not FL hTERT mRNA, was present in resting T cells (18) . Here we found CD4 + and CD8 + T N cells from approximately half of study subjects had FL hTERT mRNA but no detectable FL hTERT mRNA in CD8 + T EM cells from any study subjects. Although undetectable telomerase activity in the presence of FL hTERT in resting T cells might be explained by the lack of activated kinases required for telomerase activity that are downstream of TCR, such as activated AKT (36) , or the presence of PP2A phosphatase that inhibits telomerase activity via dephosphorylating both AKT and hTERT (37) , the presence of both FL and ASPs in 30% of five T cell subsets (excluding CD8 + T EM ) raises another possibility that the lack of telomerase activity in these resting T cells could also be due to the ASPs outcompeting the FL hTERT for hTERC binding resulting in non-functional telomerase complexes (38, 39) . However, it is worth noting that the measurements of hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity were carried out in bulk cells. It is currently unknown whether hTERT FL and ASPs are present in a single resting T cell, or whether individual cells exclusively express either FL or ASP. To resolve this, assessing hTERT at the single cell level will be needed, but the sparse expression of hTERT mRNA in freshly isolated T cells is currently a major hurdle that will require assays of improved sensitivity.\nT cell generation and differentiation from lineage committed precursor cells are precisely regulated processes (40) . During na\u00efve to effector to memory T cell differentiation, several key transcription factors have been reported in the control of differentiation (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) . Our findings show that hTERT exhibits reduced expression during T cell differentiation in both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and reduction of telomerase activity is associated with decreased activation-induced proliferation and increased apoptosis in vitro. The functions of telomerase in T cell differentiation could potentially involve both telomere maintenance and extratelomeric roles such as cell survival (47) (48) (49) . The influence of telomerase on T cell survival is further observed here in differentiated T cell subsets in in vitro culture as well as in knockdown of hTERT/telomerase in CD4 + T N cells. Roth et al. have shown that blocked endogenous hTERT expression by ectopic expression of dominant-negative hTERT resulted in decreased lifespan of T cell clones in vitro (24) . More recently, Zhdanov et al. used a bacterially derived telomerase inhibitor (Rhodospirillum rubrum L-asparaginase) and show that reduced telomerase results in telomere shortening, reduced lifespan, and increased apoptosis in CD4 + T cells in vitro (50) . Higher telomerase activity in mature CD4 + compared to mature CD8 + single positive thymocytes has been reported (14) . Here we find that peripheral CD4 + T cell subsets expressed more hTERT mRNA and higher activation-induced telomerase activity than their CD8 + T cell counterparts. This suggests that there is a lineage difference in hTERT/telomerase expression between CD4 + and CD8 + T cells from thymus to periphery. Intriguingly, CD4 + T cells have higher levels of activation-induced telomerase activity and longer replicative lifespan than do CD8 + T cells in vitro. Whether and how such differences impact the functions of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in vivo remains to be determined. Importantly, how hTERT expression is regulated during T cell differentiation will require further study.\nT cells with shorter telomeres are found in old humans, which has been attributed to cumulative telomere loss due to cell divisions over time (28) . Our recent report of reduced activationinduced telomerase activity in T cells of old compared to young humans (30) suggests that reduced telomerase enzymatic activity also contributes to telomere shortening with age. Here we show age-associated alterations in activation-induced telomerase activity in T cell subsets. CD4 + T N and T CM cells have significantly reduced telomerase activity in response to in vitro activation in old compared to young humans whereas CD8 + T EM cells have significantly elevated telomerase activity in old compared to young humans. While induced telomerase activities in CD4 + T N and CD8 + T EM cells are closely correlated with hTERT mRNA, CD4 + T CM also showed reduced telomerase activity in old compared to young subjects without significant reduction of hTERT mRNA. This suggests that aging affects activation-induced telomerase not only at hTERT transcription but also in the subsequent levels of telomerase formation. Such age-related alteration of telomerase in activated T cells may explain the impaired activationinduced proliferation of T cells found in old subjects (51, 52) . The difference of hTERT/telomerase expression was not due to better proliferation of young than old subjects. Thus, the precise changes that occur with age underlying the alteration of telomerase induction in CD4 + T N , T CM , and CD8 + T EM cells in old humans remain unclear. A better understanding of hTERT/telomerase regulation and its change in old humans could provide a basis for strategies to enhance telomerase activity for improving T cell function in old humans and in T cellbased therapeutics."}, {"section_title": "DATA AVAILABILITY", "text": "All datasets generated for this study are included in the manuscript and/or the Supplementary Files."}, {"section_title": "ETHICS STATEMENT", "text": "This study was carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the National Institute on Aging and approved by the Institutional Review Board.
