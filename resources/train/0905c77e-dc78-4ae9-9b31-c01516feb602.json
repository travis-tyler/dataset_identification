NASS conducts hundreds of surveys a year to estimate crops and livestock, explore production practices, and identify economic trends. The Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) is a multipurpose national survey conducted annually on varying commodities. ARMS is the primary vehicle by which NASS obtains data on chemical use and production practices for target commodities. ARMS also collects economic information used for assessing the financial well-being of the United States' agricultural sector. Over time the response rates for ARMS and other NASS surveys have been decreasing. To help counteract this decrease, NASS is conducting research to improve its understanding of the reasons for survey nonresponse. This will provide the Agency with the necessary tools for assessing and improving the data collection process. This report focuses on two studies conducted in Louisiana. The first study examines the effect on response rates of providing farm operators with an economic brief created from 2005 ARMS data. By showing the use and importance of the data and the operators' participation, NASS hoped to increase response rates for Phase III. The second study focused on examining the reasons for nonresponse in Louisiana."}, {"section_title": "ARMS", "text": "ARMS data are used by farm organizations, commodity groups, agribusiness, Congress, state departments of agriculture, and the USDA. The USDA uses ARMS data to evaluate the financial wellbeing of farms and ranches. The USDA also uses the data to objectively evaluate government policies and other critical issues related to agriculture and the rural economy. The ARMS is composed of three phases. Phase I is conducted May through July. This first phase is designed to ensure that operations are in business and to determine whether they are currently producing targeted commodities (i.e. rice, soybeans, or broilers). Phase II, conducted October through December, focuses on chemical usage and production practices for target commodities. Phase III occurs February through April of the following year. ARMS Phase III's (ARMS III) data are used to assess the financial condition of the farm sector. This phase collects data on income, expenses, assets, debt, and operator characteristics."}, {"section_title": "ARMS III", "text": "This report focuses on the 2006 ARMS III in Louisiana, where data collection actually occurred in February through April of 2007.

Responses during the screening phase had determined the questionnaire version each operation received in ARMS III."}, {"section_title": "NONRESPONSE", "text": "In general, survey nonresponse negatively impacts data and estimates, and it increases survey costs. Nonresponse in ARMS III affects NASS' income/expense estimates, increases data collection time, and significantly complicates the data editing process.

Therefore, NASS is focusing its efforts on understanding and improving the data collection process in order to reduce survey nonresponse."}, {"section_title": "RESEARCH PROJECT ORIGINATION", "text": "In the summer of 2006, NASS' Louisiana Field Office (LA FO) initiated a survey nonresponse research project with NASS' Research and Development Division (RDD). The original goal was to determine whether or not providing an economic brief, developed using past ARMS data, would increase survey response rates for ARMS III. The study was later expanded to include the recording/documenting of the actual reasons for survey nonresponse. NASS expected the following: 1. Supplying the sampled operators with an economic brief based on last year's data would increase survey response rates and reduce item nonresponse in the Farm Household Section of the questionnaire. 2. Documenting reasons for nonresponse would provide a deeper understanding of nonresponse as it relates to ARMS III, which would, in turn, provide valuable insight in increasing future response rates."}, {"section_title": "THE RESEARCH PROJECT", "text": "For the 2006 ARMS III, 617 operations were sampled in Louisiana, based on income, acreage, and known target commodities. Louisiana's target commodities were rice, soybeans and broilers. The probability of being sampled varied based on the operation's size and its commodities. Four versions of the ARMS III were used to collect data: a general version called the Cost and Returns Report (CRR) and three commodity specific versions (rice, broilers, and soybeans). A pre-survey letter was sent informing operators that field representatives would be contacting them to schedule an interview. Enclosed with the pre-survey letter was an economic brief produced by the Economic Research Service (ERS) titled, \"Economic Well-Being of Farm Households\". This was provided to all NASS ARMS III participating field offices for distribution, to show the value of the data collected the previous year. [See Appendix A for a copy of the economic brief.] The effect of the economic brief on response rates was assessed using an experimental design where operators were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group. Half (308) of the sample received the brief. This group was labeled the \"treatment group\". Those not receiving the brief were labeled the \"control group\". Questionnaires for operations receiving the economic brief had a code value of 1 entered in the 0093 office use box on the back page. This allowed for easy tracking of the group to which the questionnaire was assigned. After the survey, the response rates of the two groups were compared, and differences were tested using the Chi-Square Test of Independence. In the past, NASS has conducted various studies on the effect of both monetary incentives and nonmonetary ones (clocks, hats, etc.) on ARMS III response rates (McCarthy, Beckler, & Ott, 2006;Beckler, Horvath, & Ott, 2005). However, for this study the incentive is an actual document that was created from data collected in the prior year's survey. There are three types of nonresponse: refusals, inaccessibles, and incompletes. Refusals are operators who were actually contacted for data collection but refused to respond. Inaccessibles are operators who were not available and thus were not contacted for data collection. Incompletes occur when, for some reason, the field enumerator was not able to complete all the questions on the questionnaires. In a refusal situation, the field enumerator asked the operator why he/she chose not to participate in the survey and recorded the reason on the questionnaire. In the case of an inaccessible operator, the field enumerator recorded the reason why the operator could not be contacted. For incompletes, the field enumerator would record why the questionnaire could not be fully completed. In all cases, the field enumerator reviewed a handout containing various refusal/inaccessible reasons. Each reason had its own corresponding numerical code. The field enumerator then recorded the appropriate nonresponse code in the 0009 Office Use Box of the questionnaire. [See Appendix B for a copy of the handout.] If a reason did not have a corresponding response code, the staff in the LA FO would allocate a new code number for that reason."}, {"section_title": "ENUMERATOR TRAINING", "text": "Survey workshops are conducted annually to train field enumerators on ARMS III data collection procedures. During the LA FO's survey workshop, field enumerators were informed that only half of the ARMS III sample was receiving an economic brief.

This additional training, in which 30 enumerators participated, took approximately 20 minutes."}, {"section_title": "FIELD ENUMERATION", "text": "Of the 617 operations sampled, only one questionnaire, where the operator is a long time refusal, was held in the office and not enumerated.

Thirteen percent of respondents refused to complete the questionnaire and 8 percent were deemed inaccessible or incomplete by field enumerators.   Table 3 displays the response rates by questionnaire version. A Chi-Square Test of Independence was conducted to compare response rates of the commodity specific questionnaires to the Cost and Returns Report (CRR) questionnaire. The number of refusals significantly varied across the treatment and control groups (X 2 = 39.21, df = 15, p = 0.0006). Thus, response rates varied significantly by questionnaire version, due largely to the substantially lower usable rate for the CRR.  This pattern of differences in response rates between the CRR version and the crop specific versions occurs every year across all participating states. This occurs for several reasons, some of which reflect public relations efforts that are done for the commodity specific versions. First, NASS met with the national rice and soybean organizations to obtain their support. Second, NASS also conducted presentations to producer groups and organizations on how the cost per acre to produce rice and soybeans is derived and how this information benefits the farmer. Third, for broilers, there were bio-security concerns, requiring additional communication with the national and local broiler organizations and contractors to obtain their support and/or permission to approach the contractees. These contacts generated \"buy-in\" for the commodity specific surveys. However, generating \"buy-in\" for the CRR version is difficult since its audience is broadly based. Thus CRR promotions had to be geared towards all farmers. Finally, in 2006, Louisiana had a total of 22,735 farms in their survey sampling population for ARMS III, (2,085 soybean producers, 1,287 rice producers and 444 broiler growers). The LA FO staff theorized that these small numbers of rice and soybean producers are surveyed more often than the average Louisiana farmer. This allowed field enumerators to develop a closer working relationship with these particular farmers and thus may explain the lower refusal rate. This close working relationship also allowed operations' business statuses (in/out of business) to be determined more quickly, and those operations not qualifying for the survey to be screened out before sampling occurred."}, {"section_title": "ECONOMIC BRIEF ANALYSES", "text": "In an effort to improve response rates, the Louisiana Field Office mailed an economic brief, \"Economic Well-Being of Farm Households\", along with a pre-survey letter to half of the sample. The economic brief, which was developed by ERS, summarized data collected from past Agricultural Resource Management Surveys. The other half of the sample served as a control group and received only the pre-survey letter. Table 4 shows the response rates for each group. Twenty-four operations were excluded since they were deemed unusable (out of business, office hold, and nonfarm operations). Response rates did not significantly differ between those who received the economic brief and those who did not (X 2 = 0.38, df = 2, p = 0.82). Therefore, one can conclude that the economic brief did not have an impact on the overall response rates for ARMS III in Louisiana. "}, {"section_title": "ECONOMIC BRIEF'S IMPACT ON SECTION J (FARM HOUSEHOLD)", "text": "The LA FO also wanted to examine whether completeness of Section J (Farm Household) of the questionnaire improved for those receiving the brief. A copy of Section J is included as Appendix C. Section J contains questions pertaining to farm household demographics: race, education, income, farm assets/debt, and farm expenses. Due to the personal nature of these items, farmers often find this section invasive, and thus refuse to answer any or all of the questions. Of all the sections, Section J has the lowest item response rate. If the respondent is unable or refuses to answer this section, the office staff enters a value of \"1\" in Office Use Box 2002. Only four questionnaires had this section coded a complete refusal. Two were from the treatment group and the other two from the control group. Although these are extremely limited counts, it appears operators who received the economic brief were just as likely to refuse Section J as those who did not. However, additional states would need to be studied to truly assess the effect of the economic brief on Section J. If Section J was partially complete, office staff coded each question left unanswered with a \"-1\". The analysis revealed that the response rate to questions in Section J was slightly higher for operators not receiving the brief.

Next, using the nonresponse coding sheet provided, enumerators recorded the code that most closely matched the reason expressed. The results are displayed in Table 6. The primary reason for refusing was \"Would not take time / too busy.\" This was followed by \"Information too personal / none of your business\" and \"Refused but no reason given.\" There were six questionnaires for which the reason expressed for the refusal was \"I will have nothing to do with the Government\". This is unusual since a completed Phase I questionnaire is required to be eligible for Phase III. However, closer examination revealed that the spouse, or someone other than the operator, completed the screener questionnaire in five of these instances. The sixth instance occurred when the operator refused to participate but the field enumerator filled in Phase I's questionnaire using data from the local Farm Service Agency office. Refused, but no reason given. 7 \"I will have nothing to do with the Government.\" 7 Will do other surveys, but not financial surveys. 4 The respondent feels the operation's records are inadequate to complete the interview. 4 Respondent only does compulsory surveys. 4 Contact attempted, but respondent refuses on all surveys, and refused on this one. 4 Family illness / death. 2 The respondent feels that surveys and reports hurt the farmer more than help. 2 Would not keep appointments. 2 \"My farm is too small to count / too small to be representative. 1 \"I just did a different survey for your office.\" 1 \"I do not like surveys / I do not do surveys.\" 1 Does not think the information is kept confidential. 1 Mentions a specific grievance with the state cooperator. 1 \"You contact me too often.\" 1 Farm records are at the tax advisors / lawyers. 1 Spouse / secretary / etc. will not let the enumerator see the operator. 1 Does not want to report due to legal / financial problems. 1 Quitting farming. 1 \"This is not a farm.\""}, {"section_title": "98 Total", "text": "In 1990 and 1991, reasons for refusals and inaccessibles were studied across multiple states in ARMS III, (O'Connor 1991 and1992).
