[{"section_title": "", "text": "For youth to fulfill their potential in school, schools should be safe and secure places for all students, teachers, and staff members. Without a safe learning environment, teachers may have difficulty teaching and students may have difficulty learning. Gauging the safety of the school environment, however, may be difficult given the large amount of attention devoted to isolated incidents of extreme school violence nationwide. Ensuring safer schools requires establishing good indicators of the current state of school crime and safety across the nation and periodically monitoring and updating these indicators. Indicators of School Crime and Safety is designed to provide an annual snapshot of specific crime and safety indicators, covering topics such as victimization, fights, bullying, disorder, teacher injury, weapons, student perceptions of school safety, and others. In addition to covering a wide range of topics, the indicators are based on information drawn from surveys of students, teachers, and principals, and data collections by federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Students ages 12-18 were victims of about 2 million nonfatal crimes of violence or theft at school in 2001, with the majority (62 percent) of all victimizations at school being thefts. However, this report is not only concerned with the safety of students in schools. Where comparable data are available for crimes that occur outside of school grounds, these data are offered as a point of comparison. In fact, as the data in this report show, a larger number of serious violent victimizations (that is, rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault) take place away from school than at school) Data on homicides and suicides at school show there were 32 school-associated violent deaths in the United States between July 1, 1999 and June 30, 2000, including 24 homicides, 16 of which involved school-aged children. In each school year from 1992 to 2000, youth ages 5-19 were at least 70 times more likely to be murdered away from school than at school. Trends in school crime over time are also of interest to researchers, educators, and families. Data show that the percentage of students being victimized at school has declined over recent years. Between 1995 and 2001, the percentage of students who reported being victims of crime at school decreased from 10 percent to 6 percent. This included a decrease in theft (from 7 percent to 4 percent) and a decrease in violent victimization (from 3 percent to 2 percent) over the same time period. In 2001, younger students (ages 12-14) were more likely to be victimized at school than older students (ages 15-18); however, away from school, older students were more likely to be victimized than their younger counterparts (Indicator 2). The percentages of students in grades 9-12 who have been threatened or injured with a weapon on school property2 have shown no measurable differences in recent years (Indicator 4). In 1993In , 1995In , 1999, between 7 and 9 percent of students reported being threatened or injured with a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club on school property in the preceding 12 months. The percentage of students who reported being in a fight anywhere declined between 1993 and 2001, from 42 percent to 33 percent (Indicator 5). Similarly, the percentage of students who reported fighting on school property also declined over this period, from 16 percent to 13 percent. In 2001, 8 percent of 12-through 18-year-old students reported being bullied at school in the last 6 months, up from 5 percent in 1999 (Indicator 6). Both males and females were more likely to report being bullied in 2001 than in 1999 (Indicator 6). In 2001, males were more likely than females to report being bullied (9 and 7 percent, respectively); however, in 1999, no such difference could be detected (5 percent each)."}, {"section_title": "Violence and Crime at SchoolPublic School Reports", "text": "In 1999-2000, 20 percent of all public schools experienced one or more serious violent crimes such as rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault.

This report also provides the number of disciplinary actions taken by school principals for reasons not related to academics. About 54 percent of public schools reported taking a serious disciplinary action in the 1999-2000 school year. Of those disciplinary actions, 83 percent were suspensions lasting 5 days or more, 11 percent were removals with no services (i.e., expulsions), and 7 percent were transfers to specialized schools (Indicator 8). Secondary schools were more likely than other schools to experience a violent incident during the 1999-2000 school year (92 vs. 61-87 percent for elementary, middle, and combined schools). Likewise, larger schools were more likely to experience a violent incident than smaller schools. About 89 percent of schools with 1,000 or more students experienced a violent incident, compared with 61 percent of schools with less than 300 students (Indicator 7). 2Definitions for \"on school property\" and \"at school\" may differ.

From 1997 through 2001, senior high school and middle/junior high school teachers were more likely to be victims of violent crimes (most of which were simple assaults) than elementary school teachers (Indicator 9). Teachers were differentially victimized by violent crimes at school according to where they taught (Indicator 9). From 1997 through 2001, urban teachers were more likely to be victims of violent crimes than suburban and rural teachers. In the 1999-2000 school year, 9 percent of all elementary and secondary school teachers were threatened with injury by a student, and 4 percent were physically attacked by a student (Indicator 10).

In both 1999 and 2001, students were more likely to be afraid of being attacked when they were at school than away from school. Between 1993 and 2001, the percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported carrying a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club on school property within the previous 30 days declined from 12 percent to 6 percent (Indicator 11). Between 1999 and 2001, no differences were detected in the percentage of students ages 12-18 who avoided one or more places at school (about 5 percent in each year) (Indicator 13). These estimates represented a decrease from 1995, when 9 percent of students avoided places at school. In 2001, 12 percent of students ages 12-18 reported that someone at school had used hate-related words against them (Indicator 14). That is, in the previous 6 months, someone at school had called them a derogatory word related to race, religion, ethnicity, disability, gender, or sexual orientation. During the same period, about 36 percent of students saw hate-related graffiti at school. In 2001, 20 percent of students reported that street gangs were present at their schools (Indicator 15). Students in urban schools were more likely to report the presence of street gangs at their schools (29 percent) than were suburban and rural students (18 and 13 percent, respectively). In 1999-2000, public school principals were asked to report how often certain disciplinary problems occurred at their schools. Twenty-nine percent of public schools reported that student bullying occurred on a daily or weekly basis and 19 percent reported student acts of disrespect for teachers occurred at the same frequency (Indicator 16). Additionally, 13 percent reported student verbal abuse of teachers and 3 percent reported occurrences of student racial tensions and widespread disorder in the classrooms with the same frequency. Between 1993 and 2001, no consistent patterns of increase or decrease were found in the percentage of students who had consumed alcohol, both anywhere and on school property (Indicator 17). In 2001, 5 percent of students in grades 9-12 had at least one drink of alcohol on school property in the 30 days prior to the survey. Forty-seven percent of students had at least one drink anywhere during the same period.

Violent deaths in schools are tragic events that affect not only the individuals and families directly involved, but also everyone in the schools and communities where they occur. In the 2001-02 school year, 17 school-aged youth were victims of a school-associated violent death. In this indicator, a school-associated violent death is a homicide, suicide, legal intervention (involving a law enforcement officer), or unintentional firearm-related death in which the fatal injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States. Deaths that occurred while the victim was on the way to or from regular sessions at school, or while the victim was attending or traveling to or from an official school-sponsored event, were also considered a school-associated violent death. Victims of school-associated violent deaths include students, staff members, and other nonstudents. Data were drawn from a number of data sets to enable comparisons of homicides and suicides at school and away from school. Data for school-associated violent deaths during the 1999-2000 through 2000 01 school years are preliminary. In the most recent school year for which data from all sources are available, from July 1, 1999 to June 30, 2000, there were 32 school-associated violent deaths (table 1.1). Of these violent deaths, 24 were homicides and 8 were suicides. Sixteen of the homicides and 6 of the suicides were of school-aged youth (ages 5-19) at school (figure 1.1 and table 1.1). Combined, this translates into less than 1 homicide or suicide of a school-aged youth at school per million students enrolled during the 1999-2000 school year) Away from school, during roughly the same time period, there were 2,124 homicides and 1,922 suicides of youth ages 5-19. From July 1, 1992 to June 30, 2000, 390 school-associated violent deaths occurred on campuses of U.S. elementary or secondary schools. Of these violent deaths, 234 were homicides and 43 were suicides of school-aged youth (ages 5-19). Away from school during roughly the same period,2 24,406 children ages 5-19 were victims of homicide and 16,735 children committed suicide. In each school year, youth were at least 70 times more likely to be murdered away from school than at school. Between July 1, 1992 and June 30, 1998, no consistent pattern of increase or decrease was observed in the number of homicides or suicides of school-aged youth at school (figure 1.2 and table 1.1). During this period, between 28 and 34 homicides and between 1 and 7 suicides of school-aged youth occurred at school in each year. However, from July 1, 1998 to June 30, 2002, there has been a decline in the number of homicides at school, from 33 homicides of youth at school during the 1998-99 school year, to 14 during the 2001-2002 school year. 1The total number of students in grades K-12 enrolled during the Fall of the 1999 school year was 52,020,000 (U.S. Department of Education 2003). 2The estimates include homicides of youth ages 5-19 occurring from July 1, 1992 to June 30, 2000 and suicides of youth ages 5-19 occurring from 1993 to 2000 calendar years.  -94 1994-95 1995-96 1996-97 1997-98 1998-99 1999-20002 2000-012 School year Homicides at schooll Suicides at school' 2Data are preliminary and subject to change.

Theft and violence at school and while going to and from school can lead to a disruptive and threatening environment, physical injury, and emotional stress and can be an obstacle to student achievement (Elliott, Hamburg, and Williams 1998). Data from the National Crime Victimization Survey show that students ages 12-18 were victims of about 2 million nonfatal crimes (theft plus violent crime) while they were at school and about 1.7 million crimes while they were away from school in 2001 (tables 2.1 and 2.3).3 These figures represent victimization rates of 73 crimes per 1,000 students at school, and 61 crimes per 1,000 students away from school (figure 2.1 and tables 2.2 and 2.4). Students ages 12-18 were more likely to be victims of theft at school than away from school between 1992 and 2001, in all but 2 years (1997 and 2000) (tables 2.1 and 2.3). In 2001, about 1.2 million thefts occurred at school, and about 913,000 occurred away from school. In 2001, students ages 12-18 were victims of about 764,000 violent crimes at school (rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated and simple assault), including 161,000 serious violent crimes (rape, sexual assault, robbery and aggravated assault). Away from school, students were victims of about 758,000 violent crimes, including 290,000 serious violent crimes. Although during most of the period between 1992 and 2001, the victimization rates for violent crime and serious violent crime were lower at school than away from school, no difference could be detected in the violent victimization rate for students at school and away from school in 2001. The victimization rate for students ages 12-18 generally declined for thefts, violent crimes, and serious violent crimes at school and away from school between 1 992 and 2001 (figure 2.1 and tables 2.2 and 2.4). Specifically, the violent victimization rate generally declined between 1992 and 2001 from 48 to 28 crimes per 1,000 students at school and from 71 to 28 crimes per 1,000 students away from school. While this trend indicates an overall decline during this time frame, no difference was detected between 2000 and 2001 in the number of violent victimizations. In 2001, the rate of serious violent crime away from school was higher for urban students than for both suburban and rural students (figures 2.2 and 2.3, and tables 2.2 and 2.4). However, no differences were detected in the likelihood of theft, violent victimization, and serious violent victimization at school between students living in urban, suburban, and rural areas. Younger students (ages 12-14) were more likely than older students (ages 15-18) to be victims of crime at school while older students were more likely than younger students to be victimized away from school. No differences could be detected in the rate of theft, violent victimization, and serious violent victimization between males and females both at school and away from school. 3\"Students\" refers to persons 12-18 years of age who reported being in any elementary or secondary grade at the time of the survey. An uncertain percentage of these persons may not have attended school during the survey reference period. These data do not take into account the number of hours that students spend at school and the number of hours they spend away from school.  1Estimate based on fewer than 10 cases.

The most frequently occurring type of nonfatal crime in the United States is theft, though violent crime continues to be of importance in examining school safety (U.S. Department of Justice 2000). Data from the School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey show a decrease in the percentage of students affected by most types of victimization in recent years. For example, the percentage of students ages 12-18 who reported being victims of nonfatal crimes at school during the previous 6 months was lower in 2001 than in 1999 and 1995 (6 percent vs. 8 and 10 percent, respectively) (table 3.1). Student reports of theft at school decreased from 7 percent in 1995 to 4 percent in 2001. In addition, student reports of violence at school decreased from 1995 to 1999 but were not measurably different between 1999 and 2001 (3 percent in 1 995 and 2 percent in both 1999 and 2001). In 2001, male students were more likely than female students to report any criminal victimization (6 vs. 5 percent). Among 6th-12th-grade students, as student grade level increased, reports of victimization generally decreased in all survey years (figure 3.1 and table 3.1). Nonetheless, for students in each grade level, the percentage who reported being victims of nonfatal crimes declined between 1995 and 2001. During this period, reports of victimization dropped from 10 percent to 6 percent for 6th-graders and from 6 percent to 3 percent for 12th-graders. Nonfatal victimization rates varied according to school sector. In each survey year, public school students were more likely to report having been victims of violent crime than their private school counterparts. Public school students were also more likely than private school students to report being victims of theft in 1995 and 2001.

Every year, some students are threatened or injured with a weapon while they are on school property. The percentage of students victimized in this way provides an important measure of how safe our schools are and how this changes over time. In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades 9-12 were asked whether they had been threatened or injured with a weapon on school property during the 12 months preceding the survey. Results show that the percentage of students who were threatened or injured in this way has fluctuated in recent years without a clear trend. In all survey years from 1993 to 2001, between 7 percent and 9 percent of students reported being threatened or injured with a weapon, such as a gun, knife, or club, on school property (table 4.1). The likelihood of being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property varied by student characteristics. In each survey year, males were more likely than females to report being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property (figure 4.1 and table 4.1). For example, in 2001, 12 percent of male students reported being threatened or injured in the past year, compared with 7 percent of female students. Among 9th-12th-grade students, those in lower grades were more likely to be threatened or injured with a weapon on school property than were those in higher grades in all survey years (figure 4.2 and table 4.1). In 2001, 13 percent of 9th-graders reported that they were threatened or injured with a weapon on school property, compared with 9 percent of 10th-graders, 7 percent of llth-graders, and 5 percent of 12th-graders. Finally, students' likelihood of being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property was examined by race/ethnicity. In 2001, Pacific Islander students were more likely than Black, Hispanic, or White students to report being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property. While there appear to be large differences in other racial/ ethnic groups, some of these estimates are associated with large standard errors and should be interpreted with caution.

Schools at which there are numerous physical fights may not be able to maintain a focused learning environment for students. Further, students who are involved in fights on school property may have difficulty succeeding in their studies (Hamburg 1998). In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades 9-12 were asked about their general involvement in physical fights during the preceding 12 months (referred to as \"anywhere\" in this analysis) and their involvement in physical fights on school property. The percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported being in a fight anywhere declined from 1993 to 2001from 42 percent in 1993 to 33 percent in 2001 (table 5.1). Similarly, the percentages of students who reported fighting on school property in these years also declined, from 16 percent in 1993 to 13 percent in 2001. In all survey years, males were more likely than females to have been in a fight anywhere and on school property (figure 5.1 and table 5.1). In 2001, 43 percent of males said they had been in a fight anywhere, and 18 percent said they had been in a fight on school property. In that same year, 24 percent of females reported they had been in a fight anywhere, and 7 percent said they had been in a fight on school property. When looking at different grade levels, students in lower grades reported being in fights more frequently than students in higher grades both anywhere and on school property in all survey years (figure 5.2 and table 5.1). For example, in 2001, 17 percent of 9th-graders reported being in a fight on school property, while 8 percent of 12th-graders reported the same. In 2001, the percentages of students engaging in fights anywhere varied according to students' race/ethnicity. Specifically, Asian students were less likely than Black, White, and Hispanic students to report being in a fight anywhere (22 percent vs. 32-37 percent for Black, White, and Hispanic students). However, a similar pattern could not be detected in the percentages of students who reported being in a fight at school.

Bullying can contribute to an environment of fear and intimidation in schools (Arnette and Walsleben 1998;Ericson 2001). In the School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12-18 were asked if they had been bullied (for example, picked on or made to do things they did not want to do) at school. In 2001, 8 percent of students reported that they had been bullied at school in the last 6 months, up from 5 percent in 1999 (table 6.1). In 2001, males were more likely than females to be bullied (9 vs. 7 percent); however, no differences could be detected according to students' sex in 1999 (about 5 percent each) (figure 6.1 and table 6.1). The percentage of students who reported that they had been bullied increased between 1999 and 2001 for all racial/ethnic groups except Blacks. About 6 percent of Black students in both years reported they had been bullied. During this period, the percentage of students who had been bullied increased from 5 to 9 percent for White students, and from 4 to 8 percent for Hispanic students.

In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, principals of public schools were asked to provide the number of violent incidents, serious violent incidents, thefts, and other incidents that occurred at their school, as well as the number of incidents that were reported to the police. Violent incidents include rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or fight with or without a weapon, threat of physical attack with or without a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon. In 1999-2000, an estimated 1.5 million violent incidents occurred in public elementary and secondary schools (table 7.1). Seventy-one percent of public schools experienced one or more violent incidents and 36 percent of schools reported one or more such incidents to the police (tables 7.1 and 7.2). Twenty percent of schools experienced one or more serious violent incidents (which are a subset of violent incidents and include rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or fight with a weapon, threat of physical attack with a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon) and 46 percent of public schools experienced one or more thefts. These translate into an estimated 61,000 serious violent incidents and 218,000 thefts at public schools in 1999-2000. When looking at reports to police, 15 percent of public schools reported one or more serious violent incidents to the police and 28 percent reported one or more thefts to the police. The prevalence of violent incidents and those reported to the police varied by the school level and size of the school (figures 7.1 and 7.2 and tables 7.1 and 7.2). Schools with students in higher grades were more likely to experience a violent incident than those with students in lower grades. Specifically, secondary schools were more likely to have a violent incident than elementary, middle, or combined schools (92 percent vs. 61-87 percent for the other school levels). A similar pattern was observed for those incidents that were reported to the authorities: 71 percent of secondary schools reported a violent incident, compared with 20 percent of elementary schools, 56 percent of middle schools, and 51 percent of combined schools. Likewise, larger schools were more likely to have a violent incident and report one or more violent incidents to the police than smaller schools. About 89 percent of schools with 1,000 students or more had a violent incident, compared with 61 percent of schools with less than 300 students. When examining violent incidents by the location of public schools, city schools were more likely than urban fringe schools to experience or report to the police at least one violent incident during the 1999-2000 school year (figure 7.3 and tables 7.1 and 7.2). Seventy-seven percent of urban schools had one or more violent incidents and 44 percent reported one or more incidents to the police, compared with 67 and 35 percent, respectively, of urban fringe schools.

The extent to which schools remove students from regular instruction as a result of crime and violence has important consequences for student instruction. In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public school principals were asked to report the number of disciplinary actions taken during the 1999-2000 school year for specific offenses that were not academic infractions.

Students are not the only victims of crime at school. Teachers are also targets of violence and theft in schools. In addition to the personal toll that violence may take on teachers, those who worry about their safety may have difficulty teaching and may leave the profession altogether (Elliott, Hamburg, and Williams 1998). Information on the number of crimes against teachers at school can help show the extent of the problem. Estimates of teacher victimization are drawn from the National Crime Victimization Survey, which obtains information about the occupation of survey respondents. These events are not limited to offenses committed by students; offenses committed by others against teachers at school are also included. Over the 5-year period from 1997 to 2001, teachers were the victims of approximately 1.3 million nonfatal crimes at school, including 817,000 thefts and 473,000 violent crimes (rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault) (table 9.1). Among the violent crimes against teachers during this 5-year period, there were about 48,000 serious violent crimes (accounting for 10 percent of the violent crimes), including rape or sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault. On average, these figures translate into a rate of 21 violent crimes per 1,000 teachers, and 2 serious violent crimes per 1,000 teachers annually.4 During the 5-year period, the annual rate of violent victimization for teachers varied according to their sex and their instructional level (figure 9.1 and table 9.1). Over the 5year period from 1997 to 2001, male teachers were more likely than female teachers to be victims of violent crimes (39 vs. 16 crimes per 1,000 teachers). Also, senior high school and middle/junior high school teachers were more likely than elementary school teachers to be victims of violent crimes (31 and 33 vs. 12 violent crimes per 1,000 teachers, respectively). Teachers in urban areas were mere vulnerable to violent crime victimization at school than others. For example, annually over the 5-year period, urban teachers were more likely than rural and suburban teachers to be victims of violent crimes (28 vs. 13 and 16 crimes, respectively, per 1,000 teachers). Teachers in urban areas were more likely than those in rural areas to experience theft at school (42 and 26 crimes per 1,000 teachers, respectively). 4The average annual rate is the sum of all teacher victimizations across the 5 years divided by the sum of all teachers over those years, multiplied by 1,000."}, {"section_title": "28", "text": "School Crime and Safety: 2003  "}, {"section_title": "TEACHERS THREATENED WITH INJURY OR ATTACKED BY STUDENTS", "text": "Teachers in central city schools were more likely than their peers in urban fringe or rural schools to be threatened with injury or physically attacked. Some of the offenses against teachers are committed by students. Data on the extent to which students make threats or physically attack elementary and secondary teachers can provide a snapshot of this problem. In the Schools and Staffing Survey, teachers were asked whether they had been threatened with injury or physically attacked by a student in the previous 12 months. The survey results indicate that a smaller percentage of elementary and secondary school teachers were threatened with injury by a student at their school in the 1999-2000 school year than in the 1993-94 school year (9 vs. 12 percent) (table 10.1). No difference was detected in the percentage of teachers physically attacked by a student in the 1999-2000 school year compared to the 1993-94 school year (4 percent) (table 10.2). In 1999-2000, few differences could be detected in the likelihood of teachers being victimized by students according to teachers' race/ethnicity (tables 10.1 and 10.2). One such difference was that Black teachers were more likely to be threatened than White teachers in 1999-2000 (12 vs. 9 percent). In both survey years, teachers in central city schools were more likely to be threatened with injury or physically attacked than teachers in urban fringe or rural schools (figure 10.1 and tables 10.1 and 10.2). For example, in 1999-2000, 11 percent of teachers in central city schools had been threatened with injury by students, compared with 8 percent each in urban fringe and rural schools. Five percent of teachers in central city schools had been attacked by students, while 3 percent each of teachers in urban fringe and rural schools had experienced such attacks. In 1999-2000, teachers' reports of being victimized or attacked by a student varied according to the level and sector of their school. Secondary school teachers were more likely than elementary school teachers to have been threatened with injury by a student (10 vs. 8 percent); however, secondary school teachers were less likely to have been physically attacked (2 vs. 6 percent). Public school teachers were more likely than private school teachers to be victimized by students in school (figure 10.2 and tables 10.1 and 10.2): 10 percent of public school teachers had been threatened with injury, compared with 4 percent of private school teachers.

The presence of weapons at school can create an intimidating and threatening atmosphere, making teaching and learning difficult (Ingersoll and LeBoeuf 1997). The percentage of students who report that they carry a gun or other weapon on school property is an indicator of the breadth of the problem of weapons at school. In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students were asked if they had carried a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club in the past 30 days (referred to as \"anywhere\" in this analysis) or carried one of these weapons onto school property in the past 30 days. In 2001, 17 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported they had carried a weapon anywhere, and about 6 percent reported they had carried a weapon on school property (table 11.1). Between 1993 and 2001, the percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere generally declined from 22 to 17 percent. Similarly, the percentage of students who carried a weapon at school also declined during this periodfrom 12 to 6 percent. When looking at the types of students who carried weapons to school, the survey results show that in all years, males were at least two times more likely than females to carry a weaponboth anywhere and on school property (figure 11.1 and table 11.1). For example, in 2001, 10 percent of males carried a weapon on school property, compared with 3 percent of females. For most survey years, the likelihood of students reporting that they carried a weapon anywhere was inversely related to their grade level: students in lower grades were more likely to report that they did so than their peers in higher grades in all survey years except in 1999, at which time no such relationship was found (figure 11.2 and table 11.1). However, no consistent pattern could be detected by grade level for students who reported carrying a weapon at school in almost all of the survey years. In 2001, there were some differences in the percentages of students carrying weapons anywhere and on school property according to students' race/ethnicity. Although there appear to be large differences in the prevalence of carrying weapons among students of various racial/ethnic groups, some of these estimates are associated with large standard errors and should be interpreted with caution.

School crime may lead students to perceive specific areas at school as unsafe. In trying to ensure their own safety, they begin to avoid these areas (Ingersoll and LeBoeuf 1997). Changes in the percentage of students avoiding certain areas in school may be a good barometer of how safe schools are, at least in the minds of those who attend them. In the School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12 18 were asked whether they had avoided certain places in schoolsuch as the entrance, any hallways or stairs, parts of the cafeteria, restrooms, and other places inside the school buildingduring the previous 6 months. This indicator provides estimates of those students who responded that they avoided at least one of these places. No difference could be detected in the percentage of students who avoided one or more places in school between 1999 and 2001 (5 percent in both years) (table 13.1). Between 1995 and 1999, the percentage of students ages 12-18 who avoided one or more places in school decreased from 9 to 5 percent.

Discriminatory behavior in schools can create a hostile environment that is not conducive to learning (McLaughlin and Brilliant 1997). In the School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12 18 were asked if someone at school called them a derogatory word having to do with race, religion, ethnicity, disability, gender, or sexual orientation during the previous 6 months. In the 2001 administration of the survey, they were then asked to specify the characteristic to which the hate-related word was directed.

Behaviors discussed in this indicator include racial tensions, bullying, student verbal abuse of teachers, widespread classroom disorder, and student acts of disrespect for teachers that happened daily or once a week.

However, there was no difference detected in American Indian/Alaska Native students' use of marijuana at school between 1999 and 2001. While students from various racial/ethnic groups appear to differ in their use of marijuana, these estimates are associated with large standard errors and should be interpreted with caution.   1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 Year Total male -Female NOTE: \"On school property\" was not defined for survey respondents.

"}, {"section_title": "STUDENTS' REPORTS OF DRUG AVAILABILITY ON SCHOOL PROPERTY", "text": "In 2001, 29 percent of all students in grades 9-12 reported that someone had offered, sold, or given them an illegal drug on school property in the 12 months before the survey. The availability of drugs on school property has a disruptive and corrupting influence on the school environment (Nolin et al. 1997). In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades 9-12 were asked whether someone had offered, sold, or given them an illegal drug on school property in the 12 months before the survey. In 2001, 29 percent of all students in grades 9-12 reported that drugs were made available to them on school property (table  19.1). No consistent patterns of increase or decrease were found in the percentage of students who had reported that drugs were made available to them from 1993 to 2001, with between 24 and 32 percent of students reporting that this occurred in each survey year. Males were more likely than females to report that drugs were offered, sold, or given to them on school property in each survey year (figure 19.1 and table 19.1). For example, in 2001, 35 percent of males reported the availability of drugs, while 23 percent of females did so. In 1999 and 2001, students' racial/ethnic backgrounds were examined in relation to whether they reported having illegal drugs offered, sold, or given to them on school property (figure 19.2 and table 19.1). In 2001, Black and Asian students were less likely than Hispanic, Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders and students of multiple race/ethnicities to report that drugs were made available to them. While there appear to be other differences among students in various racial/ethnic groups, these estimates are associated with large standard errors and should be interpreted with caution. 1School-associated violent deaths include a homicide, suicide, legal intervention, or unintentional firearm-related death in which the fatal injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States, while the victim was on the way to or from regular sessions at such a school, or while the victim was attending or traveling to or from an official school-sponsored event.

The 1993-94 and 1999-2000 SASS consists of four sets of linked surveys, including surveys of schools, the principals of each selected school, a subsample of teachers within each school, and public school districts. Data were collected by multistage sampling, which began with the selection of schools. This report uses 1993-1994 and 1999-2000 SASS data. Approximately 9,900 public schools and 3,300 private schools were selected to participate in the 1993-1994 SASS and 9,900 public schools and 3,600 private schools were selected to participate in the 1999-2000 SASS. Within each school, teachers were further stratified into one of five teacher types in the following hierarchy: (1) Asian or Pacific Islander; (2) American Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo; (3) teachers who teach classes designed for students with Limited English Proficiency; (4) teachers in their first, second, or third year of teaching; and (5) teachers not classified in any of the other groups. Within each teacher stratum, teachers were selected systematically with equal probability. In 1993-1994, approximately 53,000 public school teachers and 10,400 Appendix ATechnical Notes 133 cross-sectional surveys and bias analyses are called for by NCES when that percentage is not achieved. For YRBS data, a full nonresponse bias analysis has not been done because the data necessary to do the analysis are not available. The weights were developed to adjust for nonresponse and the oversampling of black and Hispanic students in the sample. The final weights were constructed so that only weighted proportions of students (not weighted counts of students) in each grade matched national population projections. In 1999, in accordance with changes to the Office of Management and Budget's standards for the classification of federal data on race and ethnicity, the YRBS item on race/ethnicity was modified. The version of the race and ethnicity question used in 1993, 1995, and 1997  This new version of the question used in 1999 and 2001 results in the possibility of respondents marking more than one category. While more accurately reflecting respondents' racial and ethnic identity, the new item cannot be directly compared to responses to the old item. A recent study by Brener, Kann, and McManus (2003) found that allowing students to select more than one response to the race/ethnicity question on the YRBS had only a minimal effect on reported race/ethnicity among high school students. For additional information about the YRBS contact: Appendix ATechnical Notes 135 1992, the NCVS collects detailed information on the frequency and nature of the crimes of rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, theft, household burglary, and motor vehicle theft experienced by Americans and their households each year. The survey measures crimes reported as well as those not reported to police. The NCVS sample consists of about 53,841 households selected using a stratified, multistage cluster design. In the first stage, the primary sampling units (PSUs), consisting of counties or groups of counties, were selected. In the second stage, smaller areas, called Enumeration Districts (EDs), were selected from each sampled PSU. Finally, from selected EDs, clusters of four households, called segments, were selected for interview. At each stage, the selection was done proportionate to population size in order to create a self-weighting sample. The final sample was augmented to account for housing units constructed after the decennial Census. Within each sampled household, Census Bureau personnel interviewed all household members ages 12 and older to determine whether they had been victimized by the measured crimes during the 6 months preceding the interview. About 76,760 persons ages 12 and older are interviewed each 6 months. Households remain in the sample for 3 years and are interviewed 7 times at 6-month intervals. The initial interview at each sample unit is used only to bound future interviews to establish a time frame to avoid duplication of crimes uncovered in these subsequent interviews. After their seventh interview, households are replaced by new sample households. The NCVS has consistently obtained a response rate of about 92 percent at the household level. During the study period, the completion rates for persons within households were about 87 percent. Thus, final response rates were about 80 percent. Weights were developed to permit estimates for the total U.S. population 12 years and older. For more information about the NCVS, contact:  1989, 1995, 1999, and 2001 to collect additional information about school-related victimizations on a national level. This report includes data from the 1995, 1999, and 2001 collections. The 1989 data are not included in this report as a result of methodological changes to the NCVS and SCS. The survey was designed to assist policymakers as well as academic researchers and practitioners at the federal, state, and local levels so that they can make informed decisions concerning crime in schools. The SCS asks students a number of key questions about their experiences with and perceptions of crime and violence that occurred inside their school, on school grounds, on a school bus, or on the way to or from school. Additional questions not included in the NCVS were also added to the SCS, such as those concerning preventive measures used by the school, students' participation in afterschool activities, students' perceptions of school rules, the presence of weapons and street gangs in school, the presence of hate-related words and graffiti in school, student reports of bullying and reports of rejection at school, and the availability of drugs and alcohol in school, as well as attitudinal questions relating to fear of victimization and avoidance behavior at school. In all SCS survey years, the SCS was conducted for a 6-month period from January June in all households selected for the NCVS (see discussion above for information about the sampling design). It should be noted that the initial NCVS interview is included in the SCS data analysis. Within these households, the eligible respondents for the SCS were those household members who had attended school at any time during the 6 months preceding the interview, and were enrolled in grades 6-12 in a school that would help them advance toward eventually receiving a high school diploma. The age range of students covered in this report is 12-18 years of age. Eligible respondents were asked the supplemental questions in the SCS only after completing their entire NCVS interview. In 2001, the SCS survey instrument was modified from previous collections in three ways. First, in 1995 and1999, \"at school\" was defined for respondents as in the school building, on the school grounds, or on a school bus. In 2001, the definition for \"at school\" was changed to mean in the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to and from school. This change was made to the 2001 138 School Crime and Safety: 2003 c questionnaire in order to be consistent with the definition of \"at school\" as it is constructed in the National Crime Victimization Survey. Cognitive interviews conducted by the Census Bureau on the 1999 School Crime Supplement suggested that modifications to the definition of \"at school\" would not have a substantial impact on the estimates. The prevalence of victimization for 1995, 1999, and 2001 was calculated by using NCVS incident variables appended to the 1995, 1999, and 2001 SCS data files. The NCVS type of crime variable was used to classify victimizations of students in the SCS as serious violent, violent, or theft. The NCVS variables asking where the incident happened and what the victim was doing when it happened were used to ascertain whether the incident happened at school. For prevalence of victimization, the NCVS definition of \"at school\" includes in the school building, on school property, or on the way to or from school. Second, the SCS questions pertaining to fear and avoidance have changed between the 1999 and the 2001 SCS. In 1995 and 1999, students were asked if they avoided places or were fearful because they thought someone would \"attack or harm\" them. In 2001, students were asked if they avoided places or were fearful because they thought someone would \"attack or threaten to attack them.\" These changes should be considered when making comparisons between the 1995 and 1999 data and the 2001 data. Readers should also note that separate estimates were provided in the Indicators of School Crime and Safety 2001 report for the prevalence of fear at school and on the way to and from school. This year's report provides one estimate that combines at school with on the way to and from school and compares it to those students who report fear away from school. Third, the SCS question pertaining to gangs has changed in the 2001 SCS. The introduction and definition of gangs as well as the placement of the item in the questionnaire changed in the 2001 SCS. Because of these changes, the reader should be cautioned not to compare results presented in this report with those estimates of gangs presented in previous reports. Total victimization is a combination of violent victimization and theft. If the student reporfed an incident of either violent or theft victimization or both, he or she is counted as having experienced \"total\" victimization. Serious violent crimes include rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault. Violent crimes include serious violent crimes and simple assault. A total of 9,728 students participated in the 1995 SCS, 8,398 in 1999, and8,374 in 2001. In the 2001 SCS, the household completion rate was 93 percent. In the 1995 and 1999 SCS, the household completion rates were 95 percent and 94 percent, respectively; and the student completion rates were both 78 percent. For the 2001 SCS, the student completion rate was 77 percent. Thus, the overall SCS response rate (calculated by multiplying the household completion rate by the student completion rate) was 74 percent in 1995, 73 percent in 1999 and 72 percent in 2001. Response Appendix ATechnical Notes 139 rates for most survey items were hightypically over 95 percent of all eligible respondents. The weights were developed to compensate for differential probabilities of selection and nonresponse. The weighted data permit inferences about the eligible student population who were enrolled in schools in 1995, 1999  The School Associated Violent Death Surveillance System (SAVD) is an epidemiological study developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice. SAVD seeks to describe the epidemiology of school-associated violent deaths, identify common features of these deaths, estimate the rate of school-associated violent death in the United States, and identify potential risk factors for these deaths. The surveillance system includes descriptive data on all school-associated violent deaths in the United States, including all homicides, suicides, and unintentional firearm-related deaths where the fatal injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school, while the victim was on the way to or from regular sessions at such a school, or while attending or on the way to or from an official school-sponsored event. Victims of such events include nonstudents as well as students and staff members. SAVD includes descriptive information about the school, event, victim(s), and offender(s). The SAVD Surveillance System has collected data from July 1, 1992 through June 30, 2002. SAVD uses a four-step process to identify and collect data on school-associated violent deaths. Cases were initially identified through a search of the Lexis/Nexis and Dialog newspaper and media databases. Then police officials are contacted to confirm the details of the case to determine if the event meets the case definition. Once a case is confirmed, a police official and a school official are interviewed regarding details about the school, event, victim(s), and offender(s). If police officials are unwilling or unable to complete the interview, a copy of the full police report is obtained. The information obtained on schools includes school demographics, attendance/absentee rates, suspension/expulsions and mobility, school history of weapon carrying, security measures, violence prevention activities, school response to the event, and school policies about weapon carrying. Event information includes the location of injury, the context of injury (while classes held, during break, etc.), motives for injury, method of injury, and school and community events happening around the time period.

Both types of error affect the estimates presented in this report. Several sources can contribute to nonsampling errors. For example, members of the population of interest are inadvertently excluded from the sampling frame; sampled members refuse to answer some of the survey questions (item nonresponse) or all of the survey questions (questionnaire nonresponse); mistakes are made during data editing, coding, or entry; the responses that respondents provide differ from the \"true\" responses; or measurement instruments such as tests or questionnaires fail to measure the characteristics they are intended to measure. Although nonsampling errors due to questionnaire and item nonresponse can be reduced somewhat by the adjustment of sample weights and imputation procedures, correcting nonsampling errors or gauging the effects of these errors is usually difficult. Sampling errors occur because observations are made on samples rather than on entire populations. Surveys of population universes are not subject to sampling errors. Estimates based on a sample will differ somewhat from those that would have been obtained by a complete census of the relevant population using the same survey instruments, instructions, and procedures. The standard error of a statistic is a measure of the variation due to sampling; it indicates the precision of the statistic obtained in a particular sample. In addition, the standard errors for two sample statistics can be used to estimate the precision of the difference between the two statistics and to help determine whether the difference based on the sample is large enough so that it represents the population difference. Most of the data used in this report were obtained from complex sampling designs rather than a simple random design. These features of complex sampling require different techniques to calculate standard errors than are used for data collected with a simple random sample. Therefore, calculation of standard errors requires procedures that are markedly different from the ones used when the data are from a simple random sample. The Taylor series approximation technique or the balanced repeated replication (BRR) method was used to estimate most of the statistics and their standard errors in this report. Table A-3 lists the various methods used to compute standard errors for different data sets. Standard error calculation for data from the National Crime Victimization Survey and the School Crime Supplement were based on the Taylor series approximation method using PSU and strata variables available from the data set was employed. For statistics based on all years of NCVS data standard errors were derived from a formula developed by the Census Bureau, which consists of three generalized variance function (gvf) constant parameters that represent the curve fitted to the individual standard errors calculated using the Jackknife Repeated Replication technique. The formulas used to compute the adjusted standard errors associated with percentages or population counts can be found in table A-3."}, {"section_title": "Appendix ATechnical Notes 143", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "157", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Statistical Procedures", "text": "The comparisons in the text have been tested for statistical significance to ensure that the differences are larger than might be expected due to sampling variations. Unless otherwise noted, all statements cited in the report are statistically significant at the .05 level. Several test procedures were used, depending upon the type of data being analyzed and the nature of the statement being tested. The primary test procedure used in this report was the Student's t statistic, which tests the difference between two sample estimates, for example, between males and females. The formula used to compute the t statistic is as follows: ( 1)where Ei and E2 are the estimates to be compared and sel and se2 are their corresponding standard errors. Note that this formula is valid only for independent estimates. When the estimates are not independent (for example, when comparing a total percentage with that for a subgroup included in the total), a covariance term (i.e., 2*se1*se2) must be added to the denominator of the formula: Once the t value was computed, it was compared with the published tables of values at certain critical levels, called alpha levels. For this report, an alpha value of 0.05 was used, which has a t value of 1.96. If the t value was larger than 1.96, then the difference between the two estimates was statistically significant at the 95 percent level. A linear trend test was used when a statement describing a linear trend, rather than the differences between two discrete categories, was made. This test allows one to examine whether, for example, the percentage of students using drugs increased (or decreased) over time or whether the percentage of students who reported being physically attacked in school increased (or decreased) with their age. Based on a regression with, for example, student's age as the independent variable and whether a student was physically attacked as the dependent variable, the test involves computing the regression coefficient (b) and its corresponding standard error (se). The ratio of these two (b/se) is the test statistic t. If t is greater than 1.96, the critical value for one comparison at the .05 alpha level, the hypothesis that there is a linear relationship between student's age and being physically attacked is not rejected. When using data sets in which multiple years of data are available, a Bonferroni adjustment to the significance level was used when one year's estimate was compared to another. The Bonferroni adjustment to the significance level was used to ensure that the significance level for the tests as a series was at the .05 level. Generally, when multiple statistical comparisons are made, it becomes increasingly likely that an indication of a population difference is erroneous. Even when there is no difference in the population, at an alpha of .05, there is still a 5 percent chance of concluding that an observed t value representing one comparison in the sample is large enough to be statistically significant. As the number of years, and thus the number of comparisons increase, the risk of making such an erroneous inference also increases. The Bonferroni procedure corrects the significance (or alpha) level for the total number of comparisons made within a particular classification variable. For each classification variable, there are (K*(K-1)/2) possible comparisons (or nonredundant pairwise combinations), where K is the number of categories. The Bonferroni procedure divides the alpha level for a single t test by the number of possible pairwise comparisons in order to produce a new alpha level that is corrected for the fact that multiple contrasts are being made. As a result, the t value for a certain alpha level (e.g., .05) increases, which makes it more difficult to claim that the difference observed is statistically significant. While many descriptive comparisons in this report were tested using t statistic or the F-statistic, some comparisons among categories of an ordered variable with three or more levels involved a test for a linear trend across all categories, rather than a series of tests between pairs of categories. In this report, when differences among percentages were examined relative to a variable with ordered categories, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a linear relationship between the two variables. To do this, ANOVA models included orthogonal linear contrasts corresponding to successive levels of the independent variable. The squares of the Taylorized standard errors (that is, standard errors that were calculated by the Taylor series method), the variance between the means, and the unweighted sample sizes were used to partition total sum of squares into within-and between-group sums of squares. These were used to create mean squares for the within-and between-group variance components and their corresponding F statistics, which were then compared with published values of F for a significance level of .05. Significant values of both the overall F and the F associated with the linear contrast term were required as evidence of a linear relationship between the two variables.

BEST COPY AVAILABLE Cluster sampling Cluster sampling is a technique in which the sampling of respondents or subjects occurs within clusters or groups. For example, selecting students by sampling schools and the students that attend that school. Crime Any violation of a statute or regulation or any act that the government has determined is injurious to the public, including felonies and misdemeanors. Such violation may or may not involve violence, and it may affect individuals or property. Incident A specific criminal act or offense involving one or more victims and one or more offenders. Multi-stage sampling A survey sampling technique in which there is more than one wave of sampling. That is, one sample of units is drawn, and then another sample is drawn within that sample. For example, at the first stage, a number of Census blocks may be sampled out of all the Census blocks in the United States. At the second stage, households are sampled within the previously sampled Census blocks. Prevalence The percentage of the population directly affected by crime in a given period. This rate is based upon specific information elicited directly from the respondent regarding crimes committed against his or her person, against his or her property, or against an individual bearing a unique relationship to him or her. It is not based upon perceptions and beliefs about, or reactions to, criminal acts. School An education institution consisting of one or more of grades K through 12. School crime Any criminal activity that is committed on school property. School year The 12-month period of time denoting the beginning and ending dates for school accounting purposes, usually from July 1 through June 30. Stratification Stratification is a survey sampling technique in which the target population is divided into mutually exclusive groups or strata based on some variable or variables (e.g., metropolitan area) and sampling of units occurs separately within each stratum. Unequal probabilities A survey sampling technique in which sampled units do not have the same probability of selection into the sample. For example, the investigator may over-sample minority students in order to increase the sample sizes of minority students. Minority students would then be more likely than other students to be sampled. At school (students) Inside the school building, on school property (school parking area, play area, school bus, etc.), or on the way to or from school. At school (teachers) Inside the school building, on school property (school parking area, play area, school bus, etc.), at worksite, or while working. For thefts, \"while working\" was not considered, since thefts of teachers' property kept at school can occur when teachers are not present. Aggravated assault Attack or attempted attack with a weapon, regardless of whether or not an injury occurs, and attack without a weapon when serious injury results. Rape Forced sexual intercourse including both psychological coercion, as well as physical force. Forced sexual intercourse means vaginal, anal, or oral penetration by the offender(s). Includes attempts and verbal threats of rape. This category also includes incidents where the penetration is from a foreign object such as a bottle. Robbery Completed or attempted theft, directly from a person, of property or cash by force or threat of force, with or without a weapon, and with or without injury. Rural A place not located inside the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). This category includes a variety of localities, ranging from sparsely populated rural areas to cities with populations of less than 50,000. Serious violent crime Rape, sexual assault, robbery, or aggravated assault. Sexual assault A wide range of victimizations, separate from rape or attempted rape. These crimes include attacks or attempted attacks generally involving unwanted sexual contact between the victim and offender. Sexual assault may or may not involve force and includes such things as grabbing or fondling. Sexual assault also includes verbal threats. Simple assault Attack without a weapon resulting either in no injury, minor injury, or in undetermined injury requiring less than 2 days of hospitalization. Also includes attempted assault without a weapon. Suburban A county or counties containing a central city, plus any contiguous counties that are linked socially and economically to the central city. On the data tables, suburban areas are categorized as those portions of metropolitan areas situated \"outside central cities.\" Theft Completed or attempted theft of property or cash without personal contact. Victimization A crime as it affects one individual person or household. For personal crimes, the number of victimizations is equal to the number of victims involved. The number of victimizations may be greater than the number of incidents because more than one person may be victimized during an incident. Victimization rate A measure of the occurrence of victimizations among a specific population group. school authority, failure to attend assigned detention or on-campus supervision, failure to respond to a call slip, and physical or verbal intimidation/abuse. Intimidation To frighten, compel, or deter by actual or implied threats. It includes bullying and sexual harassment. Physical attack or fight An actual and intentional touching or striking of another person against his or her will, or the intentional causing of bodily harm to an individual. Rape Forced sexual intercourse (vaginal, anal, or oral penetration). Includes penetration from a foreign object. Robbery The taking or attempting to take anything of value that is owned by another person or organization, under confrontational circumstances by force or threat of force or violence and/or by putting the victim in fear. A key difference between robbery and theft/larceny is that a threat or battery is involved in robbery. Serious violent incidents Include rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attacks or fights with a weapon, threats of physical attack with a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon. Sexual battery An incident that includes threatened rape, fondling, indecent liberties, child molestation, or sodomy. Principals were instructed that classification of these incidents should take into consideration the age and developmentally appropriate behavior of the offenders. Sexual harassment Unsolicited, offensive behavior that inappropriately asserts sexuality over another person. The behavior may be verbal or non-verbal. Specialized school A school that is specifically for students who were referred for disciplinary reasons. The school may also have students who were referred for other reasons. The school may be at the same location as the respondent's school. Theft/larceny (taking things over $10 without personal confrontation) The unlawful taking of another person's property without personal confrontation, threat, violence, or bodily harm. Included are pocket picking, stealing purse or backpack (if left unattended or no force was used to take it from owner), theft from a building, theft from a motor vehicle or motor vehicle parts or accessories, theft of bicycles, theft from vending machines, and all other types of thefts. Vandalism The willful damage or destruction of school property including bombing, arson, graffiti, and other acts that cause property damage. Includes damage caused by computer hacking. Violent incidents Include rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attacks or fights with or without a weapon, threats of physical attack with or without a weapon, robbery with or without a weapon. Weapon Any instrument or object used with the intent to threaten, injure, or kill. Includes look-alikes if they are used to threaten others."}]
