The pattern of cortical 18 F-THK523 retention did not correlate with A\u03b2 distribution as assessed by 11 C-PIB and followed the known distribution of tau in the AD brain, being higher in temporal and parietal areas than in the frontal region.

Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the pathological accumulation of aggregated tau. AD is the most common tauopathy and the leading cause of dementia [1] , but tau deposits are also found in other variants of FTLD, such as progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA) or in some cases of behavioural frontotemporal dementia (bFTD) [2] . Other tauopathies include Down's syndrome, Guam parkinsonism-dementia complex, frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17, corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy and chronic traumatic encephalopathy [3] [4] [5] . Definitive diagnosis of these neurodegenerative conditions can only be established after death. While these tauopathies share tau immunoreactivity in post-mortem brain examination, these tau aggregates can be composed of different tau isoforms displaying very distinct histopathological and ultrastructural differences [3, 6, 7] . In AD, these tau deposits can be recognized histologically as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuropil threads as well as dystrophic neurites in senile plaques, whilst ultrastructurally they aggregate in paired helical filaments (PHF) [3, 4, 8] . While the underlying mechanisms leading to tau hyperphosphorylation, misfolding and aggregation remain unclear, tau aggregation and deposition follows a stereotypical and spatiotemporal pathway both at the intraneuronal level [8, 9] as well as in its topographical and neuroanatomical distribution in the brain [4, 10, 11] .\nThe notion that tau dysregulation is a key mediator of neurodegeneration [12, 13] has stimulated the development of therapeutics for the treatment of AD and non-AD tauopathies [14] [15] [16] . Given these treatments are currently being developed, a non-invasive method of determining the tau burden in the brain would allow a better understanding of the pathophysiology of AD, FTLD and other tau-related neurodegenerative conditions. It will also lead to improvements in differential diagnostic accuracy and accelerate drug discovery by facilitating patient selection and monitor efficacy in novel anti-tau therapeutic trials. It would assist in the early and differential diagnosis of AD and non-AD tauopathies, while helping ascertain the relationship between the spatiotemporal distribution of tau aggregates in the brain to cognition and brain volumetrics. Development of tau imaging probes poses several more challenges than those associated with A\u03b2 imaging, and these are mainly related to the idiosyncrasies of tau aggregation and deposition. In contrast to A\u03b2, most tau aggregates are intracellular, there are six tau isoforms and the different combinations of these isoforms manifest as different clinical phenotypes. Tau aggregates undergo a wide spectrum of post-translation modifications that, in addition to the combination of different isoforms, lead to diverse ultrastructural conformations and typical pathological lesions. Furthermore, tau aggregates coexist with other misfolded proteins sharing the same \u03b2-sheet secondary structure, as is in the case of AD where tau and A\u03b2 are both co-localized in grey matter areas, where the concentrations of A\u03b2 are, depending on the brain region, \u223c5-20 times higher than those of tau (for an in depth review see Villemagne et al. [17] ).\nIn recent years, the main focus has been the development of selective ligands that allow early detection of A\u03b2 deposition [18] . Among these tracers, 18 F-FDDNP was reported to nonselectively bind to both A\u03b2 deposits and NFTs [19] . Phenylquinoline derivatives binding with high affinity and selectivity for tau aggregates have been developed as candidates for tau imaging agents at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan [20] . Among them, 18 F-THK523 (THK523) was the first reported selective tau imaging tracer that can noninvasively detect tau deposits in a transgenic mouse brain [21] . This report was recently followed by several other potential tau tracer candidates [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] .\nAfter a careful in vitro evaluation, the initial in vivo characterization of a novel positron emission tomography (PET) neuroligand candidate requires to fulfill certain conditions such as safety at low tracer doses, possess high affinity and selectivity for the target, ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, display low non-specific binding with adequate regional distribution and its relation to parameters known to be associated with the intended target, suitable brain kinetics, lack of problematic radiolabelled metabolites [28] before it is applied to research or clinical use ( Supplementary Fig. 1) .\nTherefore, the main objective of the present study was to characterize the in vivo suitability of THK523 for tau imaging in humans. The in vivo assessment comprised: (a) comparing the global and regional THK523 binding in healthy controls (HC), AD and SD patients, (b) assessing the relationship between THK523 retention and cognition, (c) assessing the relationship between THK523 retention and brain volumetrics and (d) comparing the regional brain distribution of THK523 with that of 11 C-Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) in the same participants."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

THK523 retention was also significantly higher in subcortical white matter in AD ( Table 2 ). The spillover from the high retention in white matter was likely to contribute substantially to the radioactivity measured in grey matter; therefore, PVC of the images, correcting for both cortical grey matter atrophy and for white matter spillover, was performed. The PVC SUVR derived from the summed 60-90 min were subsequently used to assess THK523 retention as well as comparison with PIB and for correlation with brain volumetrics and cognitive parameters (Table 2 ). After PVC, while little or no THK523 retention was observed in cortical areas in HC, THK523 retention in AD patients was most prominent in cortical association areas, where only the temporal, parietal, hippocampal, orbitofrontal, and posterior cingulate regions ( Supplementary Fig. 2b ), brain areas known from postmortem studies to contain substantial amounts of tau deposits in AD [10, 11] , remained significant (Table 2) .

In order to avoid this issue, the associations with cognition and brain volumetrics were assessed in each clinical group separately.\nIn the case of THK523, there were no associations between cortical THK523 retention and cognitive parameters in HC, with the exception of the insula associated with episodic memory scores (r=\u22120.70, p=0.026). In the AD group, hippocampal THK523 retention was significantly associated with MMSE (r=\u22120.75, p=0.01) and episodic memory (r=\u22120.63, p=0.05) (Fig. 3) . In the AD group, a strong trend was also observed between hippocampal THK523 retention, CDR SOB (r = 0.62, p = 0.055) and non-memory scores (r=\u22120.60, p=0.056). In regard to brain volumes, only hippocampal THK523 retention was significantly associated with hippocampal volume in both the HC (r =\u22120.69, p=0.03) and AD (r= \u22120.86, p=0.001) groups (Fig. 3 ). There were no correlations between global THK523 retention and cortical grey matter volume in any of the groups.\nIn the case of PIB, there were associations between PIB retention and MMSE in the orbitofrontal (r=\u22120.67, p=0.034), anterior (r=\u22120.65, p=0.04) and posterior cingulate (r=\u22120.78, p=0.007) regions of HC. In AD, there were some associations between PIB retention and cognitive parameters, but these correlations were, in every case, in the opposite direction as expected, where PIB retention in the anterior cingulate gyrus was positively associated with MMSE (r=0.63, p=0.049), F-THK523 retention is strongly associated with hippocampal volume in both HC and AD patients.

There were no significant associations between global PIB retention and cortical grey matter volume in either HC or AD patients. In contrast to what was observed for hippocampal THK523 retention, there was no association between hippocampal PIB retention and hippocampal volume in any of the groups examined (Fig. 3) ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a selective tau imaging agent has been thoroughly evaluated in human volunteers, assessing its associations with cognition and brain volumetrics, as well as a direct comparison with A\u03b2 imaging using PIB.\nGlobal cortical THK523 binding provided a very robust separation of AD patients from healthy elderly subjects (Cohen's d=3.4). Furthermore, cortical THK523 retention in AD patients followed the reported histopathological brain distribution of PHF-tau in AD [10, 11] . Examination of the brain kinetics of THK523 showed that it presents reversible binding kinetics, reaching apparent steady state about 50 min after injection of the radiotracer. Visual inspection of the THK523 images was hampered by the very high retention in white matter. In addition to the high non-specific binding, previous reports have demonstrated substantial concentrations of PHF-tau in white matter in AD [34, 35] , suggesting THK523 retention in white matter might not solely reflect marked non-specific binding, but also some small degree of specific binding. Several factors were taken into account for the selection of the reference region. To date, no report has described tau deposition in the cerebellar cortex in sporadic AD [36] . There were no group differences in cerebellar cortex THK523 SUV, and there was no association between cerebellar cortex THK523 SUV with age in the whole cohort, or with dementia severity in the AD group, further supporting the use of the cerebellar cortex as reference region.\nThe regional brain distribution of THK523 showed a marked contrast when compared to that of PIB. While the highest PIB retention was observed in frontal, posterior cingulate, caudate and temporal cortices, the highest THK523 retention was observed in the inferior temporal, orbitofrontal, hippocampus, insula and parietal cortices. This was further confirmed by a lack of correlation between PIB SUVR and THK523 SUVR (r=0.04, p=0.90).\nSD patients were included in the evaluation of THK523 as pathological controls [31] . Rather than tau aggregates, the vast majority of SD cases have been associated with the aggregation of TDP-43 [2, 31] . SD patients showed neither THK523 nor PIB retention in the brain (Supplementary  Tables 1 and 2 ), suggesting the absence of both A\u03b2 [37] and tau deposits in SD.\nThree HC showed high cortical PIB retention (PIB+HC), consistent with previous PIB studies that have reported positive scans in 25-35 % of normal elderly individuals [38] . Despite the limited subsample size the finding is interesting because while cortical THK523 retention in PIB+HC was not significantly different from the cortical retention in PIB\u2212 HC, THK523 retention in the hippocampus and insula was significantly higher than in PIB\u2212 HC, but not significantly different from AD, suggesting that tau deposition in these regions might precede the dementia of AD [6, 39] . These findings might indicate that the combination of widespread cortical A\u03b2 plus hippocampal tau deposition might not be enough to lead to significant cognitive impairment, requiring tau deposition in polymodal and unimodal association areas of the brain for objective cognitive impairment to be manifest [7, 10, 11] .\nAs with A\u03b2 imaging [40] , longitudinal studies will assist in establishing the spatiotemporal patterns of tau deposition and help determine whether or not apparently healthy individuals with substantial hippocampal tau deposition will develop the AD phenotype, thus allowing very early, even preclinical diagnosis of AD, or if hippocampal tau deposits are just an age-associated process and only cortical tau deposition leads to cognitive impairment [39, 41] .\nIn AD, hippocampal THK523 retention was associated with cognitive parameters. Similarly, hippocampal THK523 retention was associated with hippocampal volume in both HC and AD patients. Human post-mortem studies have shown that the density of NFTs strongly correlates with neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits, while A\u03b2 plaque density does not [42, 43] , a finding that was further confirmed through A\u03b2 imaging studies [18, 32] . Furthermore, in stark contrast with A\u03b2 plaques, NFTs are usually not present in associating cortical regions in cognitively unimpaired individuals [11, 18, 39] .\nAs was previously reported in vitro [21, 44] , several lines of evidence support the notion that THK523 selectively binds to PHF-tau and not to A\u03b2 in vivo: (a) cortical THK523 retention is significantly higher in AD, following the known distribution of PHF-tau in the AD brain; (b) PIB and THK523 show different brain regional distribution patterns; (c) there is no correlation between PIB and THK523 retention; and (d) while hippocampal THK523 retention significantly correlates with cognitive parameters and hippocampal atrophy, hippocampal PIB retention does not.\nWhile this was a first-in-human study, the limited sample size requires cautious interpretation of the findings. Furthermore, while our results suggest that 18 F-THK523 can reliably quantify PHF-tau deposition in vivo, there are serious limitations associated with the tracer itself. The high white matter THK523 retention, even if it might reflect some small degree of specific binding, precludes simple visual inspection of the images and requires additional careful PVC even for a simple semi-quantitative analysis, preventing the use of THK523 in research or clinical settings."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This study has shown that despite selective, non-invasive in vivo assessment of PHF-tau in humans being possible, a single aspect of the in vivo behaviour of a tracer can derail its further development. This highlights the need for careful in vivo proof of concept studies at the initial stages of the development before embarking on more complex quantification approaches involving invasive procedures such as arterial cannulation or engaging in costly phase II studies. Better tau tracers, some of them already being evaluated in humans [23, [25] [26] [27] , will be required for applications such as monitoring disease progression and assessing efficacy of anti-tau therapy. The development of 18 F-THK523 has shown to be a significant step towards the integration of tau imaging with A\u03b2 imaging, moving us towards meeting the desired goal of earlier diagnosis of AD to assist the development of preventative treatments as well as identifying subjects for early therapeutic interventions."}]
