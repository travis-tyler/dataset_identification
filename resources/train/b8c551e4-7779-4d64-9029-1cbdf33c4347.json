[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Introduction: Suspected non-Alzheimer's pathophysiology (SNAP) is a biomarker driven designation that represents a heterogeneous group in terms of etiology and prognosis. SNAP has only been identified by crosssectional neurodegeneration measures, whereas longitudinal measures might better reflect \"active\" neurodegeneration and might be more tightly linked to prognosis. We compare neurodegeneration defined by crosssectional 'hippocampal volume' only (SNAP/L\u2212) versus both cross-sectional and longitudinal 'hippocampal atrophy rate' (SNAP/L+) and investigate how these definitions impact prevalence and the clinical and biomarker profile of SNAP in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Methods: 276 MCI patients from ADNI-GO/2 were designated amyloid \"positive\" (A+) or \"negative\" (A\u2212) based on their florbetapir scan and neurodegeneration 'positive' or 'negative' based on cross-sectional hippocampal volume and longitudinal hippocampal atrophy rate. Results: 74.1% of all SNAP participants defined by the cross-sectional definition of neurodegeneration also met the longitudinal definition of neurodegeneration, whereas 25.9% did not. SNAP/L+ displayed larger white matter hyperintensity volume, a higher conversion rate to dementia over 5 years and a steeper decline on cognitive tasks compared to SNAP/L\u2212 and the A-CN group. SNAP/L\u2212 had more abnormal values on neuroimaging markers and worse performance on cognitive tasks than the A-CN group, but did not show a difference in dementia conversion rate or longitudinal cognition. Discussion: Using a longitudinal definition of neurodegeneration in addition to a cross-sectional one identifies SNAP participants with significant cognitive decline and a worse clinical prognosis for which cerebrovascular disease may be an important driver."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have generally been divided into two classes: molecular (e.g. amyloid PET, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b2) and neurodegenerative (e.g. volumetric MRI and FDG PET). Neurodegeneration is by definition a dynamic process; however, most studies classify individuals on this dimension with cross-sectional measures. While a static measure captures past neurodegeneration, other factors may confound these measurements, for example, some individuals may have smaller hippocampal volumes for developmental or other reasons not related to neurodegeneration. A measure of declining volume over time, on the other hand, is likely a more specific indicator of a neurodegenerative process.\nHow we define neurodegeneration is gaining importance, as neurodegeneration is often used for classification in staging models. For example, the presence of atrophy or hypometabolism in the absence of cerebral amyloid defines the recently labeled category of suspected non-Alzheimer's pathophysiology (SNAP). A significant proportion of patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) have received this classification based on cross-sectional measures of neurodegeneration (Caroli et al., 2015; Petersen et al., 2013; Prestia et al., 2013) . However, the clinical implication of SNAP-MCI status remains unclear, as previous reports have shown widely varying results with regard to progression to dementia and cognitive decline. The reported progression vary from 0% to 56% in 2-3 years of follow-up (Caroli et al., 2015; Prestia et al., 2013; Wisse et al., 2015; Schreiber et al., 2017) and one study even reported a higher dementia progression rate in SNAP than in an amyloid and neurodegeneration positive, or prodromal AD (pAD), group (Petersen et al., 2013) . Similar inconsistent findings are present for cognitive decline in these groups, with some studies showing almost similar cognitive decline in SNAP and pAD (Caroli et al., 2015) , whereas others showed significantly less cognitive decline in SNAP as compared to pAD (Schreiber et al., 2017; Knopman et al., 2015; Chung et al., 2017) . It is possible that these mixed results are partly attributable to heterogeneity in underlying 'active' neurodegeneration in SNAP, but also in pAD. While extant studies have investigated longitudinal change in neurodegeneration markers in SNAP ( (Knopman et al., 2015) , also note (Burnham et al., 2016; Gordon et al., 2016) in CN older adults), no prior study has utilized a longitudinal measure of neurodegeneration to define this group.\nWe therefore compare cross-sectional evidence of neurodegeneration using hippocampal volume only (L\u2212) versus evidence of both cross-sectional and longitudinal neurodegeneration using hippocampal atrophy rate (L+) in the classification of MCI patients. As a conceptual study, we aim to examine the impact of these definitions on progression to dementia and cognitive decline. We hypothesize that the SNAP/L+ group will be enriched in individuals with a higher rate of progression to dementia and more cognitive decline than the SNAP/L\u2212 group. Additionally, we compare these groups on a number of biofluid and imaging markers aiming to gain understanding in the underlying pathology, e.g. the role of subthreshold amyloid or vascular pathology. We hypothesize that these groups have different biomarker profiles reflecting differences in the presence of more rapid neurodegeneration."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "We used data from ADNI-GO/2 (see Supplementary material) from 276 MCI participants with florbetapir and MRI scans at baseline and within 7-18 months after.\nTo establish cut-off points for neurodegenerative measures, we used data from amyloid positive (A+) participants (see Group definitions) with AD dementia for whom a baseline and follow-up (7-18 months after baseline) MRI scan were available (n = 66).

Most importantly, SNAP/L+ had a worse prognosis with a higher conversion rate and steeper decline on cognitive tasks. The SNAP/L\u2212 group showed no differences in terms of conversion rate or cognitive decline as compared to the A-CN group."}, {"section_title": "Snap", "text": "As has been pointed out previously, SNAP is likely a heterogeneous group with regard to their etiology (e.g. (Mormino et al., 2016) ). This heterogeneity is reflected in the wide range of reported outcomes in those with SNAP-MCI (Caroli et al., 2015; Prestia et al., 2013; Wisse et al., 2015; Schreiber et al., 2017) . We hypothesized that utilizing a longitudinal definition of neurodegeneration in addition to a crosssectional one might partly explain this observed heterogeneity. Indeed the SNAP/L+ group had a poorer prognosis while there was no clear difference between SNAP/L\u2212 and the A-CN group. This may indicate that part of the \"noise\" in the SNAP construct may be due to individuals who do not have evidence of 'active' neurodegeneration and their structural abnormalities (e.g. small hippocampi) may be related to developmental factors or slow aging effects that may have made their memory vulnerable to fall within the MCI category (see below). In that context, this group would not be expected to demonstrate clinical progression beyond that of controls, as was observed. Alternatively, SNAP/L+ likely represents a group with a more pathological, or active, process and would be expected to be at greater risk for clinical progression. This distinction supports the potential added value of using a dynamic measure of neurodegeneration in addition to a cross-sectional one in staging models (see (Jack Jr et al., 2016) ). Alternatively, these findings also may support the idea that one neurodegeneration measure serves as confirmatory test for the other and that having positivity for both is the most rigorous way of testing neurodegeneration with the least likelihood of false positives. It is worth noting that FDG-PET values were also abnormal in SNAP/L+, but less so in the SNAP/L-group. While this difference was not significant, it may suggest that FDG-PET may be somewhat sensitive to individuals with active neurodegeneration as measured by longitudinal hippocampal atrophy rate.\nBesides the impact of using these cross-sectional and longitudinal neurodegeneration definitions on outcomes, we also aimed to gain understanding in the potential underlying etiology of SNAP. Interestingly, the SNAP/L+ group had significantly more WMHs compared to the SNAP/L\u2212 group. Although cause and consequence cannot be disentangled here, it seems likely that cerebrovascular disease is a major driver of the ongoing hippocampal atrophy and cognitive decline observed in this group. In a posthoc correlation analysis, we found an association of WMHs with hippocampal atrophy rate in A-MCI patients (r = 0.25, p = 0.01; for A+ MCI patients: r = 0.03, p = 0.76), indeed confirming this hypothesis. It would be interesting to see if future larger studies can replicate this finding with other measures of cerebrovascular disease or the degree to which there is a pattern of atrophy that can be distinguished from a more typical one of prodromal AD. Finally, a hint of lower levels of CSF A\u03b2 can be observed with both measures of neurodegeneration as compared to the A-CN group. However, this difference with the A-CN group was not observed for the other measure of amyloid, florbetapir, and it is therefore unclear what the significance is of this finding. Previous findings on the role of subthreshold amyloid in SNAP have also not been straightforward (Wisse et al., 2015; Mormino et al., 2016; Mormino et al., 2014; Vos et al., 2016) .\nGiven that neurodegeneration is generally conceptualized as a dynamic process, what is the explanation for the SNAP group that only showed abnormality on the cross-sectional measure? One possibility is that they simply had developmentally smaller hippocampal volumes which crossed the threshold of abnormality in the context the \"normal\" volume loss associated with aging. This may make these individuals more susceptible to age-associated memory decline. Alternatively, this group may have experienced previous neuronal injury or a very slow rate of neurodegeneration thatgiven the relatively short imaging follow-up period (mean~317 days)resulted in our longitudinal measure being insensitive. Such a slow rate of progression may be consistent with the hippocampal neurodegeneration expected with primary age-related tauopathy (Jack Jr., 2014) in which neurofibrillary tangle pathology is thought to accumulate at a slower rate than in the setting of cerebral amyloidosis. Tau PET imaging will ultimately be helpful in determining if those with smaller cross-sectional hippocampi are more likely to have tangle pathology in the absence of amyloid. Although it should be noted that one recent study did not find elevated tau levels in CN SNAP participants measured with AV-1451 PET (Mormino et al., 2016) . It seems unlikely that vascular pathology explains the neurodegeneration and memory impairments in this group given the normal values on this marker. Interestingly, this group also had a surprisingly high rate of APOE-\u025b4 carriers, which has been associated with smaller hippocampi even in young adults (O'Dwyer et al., 2012) , potentially supporting a developmental hypothesis. With regard to the amyloid markers, in this group also a hint of lower CSF A\u03b2 levels was observed as compared to the A-CN group, but with normal florbetapir levels. It therefore remains to be determined if there is a role for subthreshold amyloid deposition in this group as well. Regardless, the finding of a lack of significant progressive atrophy in this group should give pause as to the conceptual meaning of neurodegeneration."}, {"section_title": "pAD", "text": "We also investigated the impact of using a longitudinal measure of neurodegeneration in addition to a cross-sectional one in the context of amyloid. As for SNAP, a considerable portion of~20% of pAD patients as defined by a cross-sectional measure of neurodegeneration displayed no longitudinal hippocampal atrophy (pAD/L\u2212). This indicates that the pAD group might also be heterogeneous in terms of the driver of current cognitive symptoms or disease stage and prognosis. Indeed, the pAD/L+ group showed a significantly larger conversion rate to dementia over five years as compared to the pAD/L\u2212 group, 55.8 vs 26.3%. This was also supported by a steeper increase in CDR and decline on the delayed recall task compared to pAD/L\u2212 group. Interestingly, the groups did not differ on most of the other biomarkers, except that the pAD/L\u2212 group somewhat paradoxically had smaller cross-sectional hippocampal volumes as compared to the pAD/L+ group. As with SNAP/L\u2212, it is possible that pAD/L\u2212 includes individuals with smaller hippocampi due to other factors, such as developmental differences and/or age-related effects that make this group vulnerable to memory loss, but that they have concomitant AD pathology that may reflect an earlier stage of disease pathophysiology than the pAD/L+ group. It is also possible that these groups simply differ in the aggressiveness of the disease or the spatial distribution of neurodegeneration. One possibility that seems unlikely in light of the slower rate of clinical decline is that the pAD/L\u2212 group are at a later stage of disease and that we are observing \"floor effects\".\nLimitations of the current study are the lack of a definitive approach for defining thresholds, the small sample size and the potential differences in the noise of the measures. That is, while both neurodegeneration markers are subject to measurement error, longitudinal measures of neurodegeneration inherently have greater variability due to the additional processing required. This may have affected the precision of the determination of neurodegeneration status. An additional limitation is that the follow up time to determine atrophy rate is somewhat arbitrary (1 year). It is unclear whether atrophy rate is constant over time and whether a longer or shorter follow-up time would have resulted in different group designations. Finally, while this study is investigating the conceptual meaning of neurodegeneration by comparing a cross-sectional measure with a longitudinal one, it might be impractical in clinical practice to obtain longitudinal imaging and certainly less desirable than being able to provide more definitive prediction at baseline. That said, our results indicate that WMH volume is related to higher longitudinal atrophy rates and might potentially be a useful cross-sectional biomarker to aid in predicting which SNAP subjects will worsen over time.\nIn conclusion, this study showed that defining neurodegeneration by both a cross-sectional and a longitudinal measure of hippocampal volume leads to the identification of a SNAP group enriched in individuals with significant cognitive and clinical decline over time, for which cerebrovascular disease could be an important driver. Indeed, conceptually a longitudinal measure of neurodegeneration is more in keeping with the dynamic and progressive nature of this process. Placed in the context of the recent ATN staging model (Jack Jr et al., 2016; Jack Jr et al., 2017) in which neurodegeneration is generally measured in a cross-sectional manner, the current results suggest that such a designation may be limited and that those with concomitant evidence of both an accelerated rate of atrophy and reduced volume may represent a distinct group in the presence or absence of cerebral amyloid. Future studies will need to confirm these results in larger cohorts and with other measures of neurodegeneration, such as FDG-PET or CSF markers of neurodegeneration.\nDisclosures B. C.
