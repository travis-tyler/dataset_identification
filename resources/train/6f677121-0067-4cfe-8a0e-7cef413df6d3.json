[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "This report presents the results of a study investigating inflation in high school grade point average (HSGPA). Inflation was measured by comparing HSGPA to ACT Assessment ( iii"}, {"section_title": "", "text": "The ACT tests were used as objective measures of student achievement across schools and over time. The ACT is an achievement test designed to measure skills taught in typical collegepreparatory high school curricula. ACT regularly conducts national curriculum studies to ensure that the content of the ACT is consistent with the high school curriculum. Different forms of the ACT tests are used at the same time and over time. However, the test development process incorporates procedures to ensure that all forms measure the same content and have the same difficulty and variability. Statistical adjustments also are employed to ensure that scores on all forms are comparable.\nThe hypothesis under investigation in this study was that, unlike ACT scores, high school grades have been subject to inflation. The present study was a follow-up to a previous study by Ziomek and Svec (1995) . They studied ACT Composite scores and HS overall GPA from 1990 to 1994. They used data similar to the data used in this study, but they divided schools into deciles based on their average ACT Composite scores. They then computed HS overall GPA and ACT Composite score statistics for the students attending the schools in each decile for the five years. They found evidence for modest grade inflation in all deciles. Koretz and Berends (2001) also investigated high school grade inflation with an emphasis on grades in mathematics. They collected test and HSGPA data for 1982 high school seniors from the High School and Beyond study and similar data for 1992 high school seniors from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988. They did not find evidence for widespread high school grade inflation during the ten years from 1982 to 1992, but they did find some evidence for a modest amount of grade inflation for high-income high school students.\nAttention also has been focused on college grade inflation. Stuart Rojstaczer, a professor of environmental science at Duke University, wrote a newspaper article about no longer giving C's in his courses (Rojstaczer, 2003) . This led him to compile a database of college GPA data from a variety of four year colleges and universities and publish it on his Web site, http://gradeinflation.com. His analysis, which extends back to the late sixties, suggests grade inflation has occurred in college grading. Johnson (2003) has written a book describing an extensive study of college grade inflation at Duke University. He found that student evaluations of instructors are affected by the instructors' grading practices, that course grading affects course enrollment, and that grading practices differ in different departments. He concludes that grade inflation is a serious problem, and he offers a number of suggestions for dealing with it. Collins (2002) attributes high school and college grade inflation to credential inflation. First, he notes that in 1900 only 10% of the U.S. population had high school diplomas, while now more than 25% of the U.S. population have college degrees. This increase in the education level of the population has led to an increase in the requirements necessary for a wide variety of jobs.\nIncreasingly higher levels of education have become necessities for employment. This has led to high school grade inflation to enable entry into college and college grade inflation to enhance competitiveness in the job market or enable entry into graduate school."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The data used for the analysis was drawn from students who graduated from public high schools between 1991 and 2003, and who took the ACT in the eleventh or twelfth grade of high school. If a student took the ACT more than once then only the student's scores from the most recent testing were included in the analysis. ACT collects course information on 30 different courses when students register to take the ACT. Because some students do not report their grades, there is a modest amount of nonrandom missing data. HS Overall GPA is based on the students' self-reported grades in 23 of these 30 courses. Four foreign language and three art courses are excluded. HS English GPA is based on self-reported grades in five courses, and HS mathematics GPA is based on self-reported grades in seven courses. The 23 courses are listed in Table 2 and Table 3 . Sawyer, Laing, & Houston (1988) studied the accuracy of these selfreported grades and found them sufficiently accurate for research purposes."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": "First, demographics for all 13 years of data are presented. Next, proportions of students completing each of the 23 courses at the time of ACT testing are presented for each year. This is followed by average grades for the 23 courses over the 13 years. Then, three different areas are analyzed. One area is the ACT Composite score and HS overall GPA derived from students' grades in the 23 courses. Another area involves the ACT English score and HS English GPA derived from students' grades in 7 English courses. The last area uses the ACT Mathematics score and HS mathematics GPA derived from students' grades in 5 mathematics courses.\nTwo sets of analyses were done. First, a marginal analysis was done for each area. The variation in HSGPA means and ACT means over the 13 years were compared. Then conditional analyses were undertaken. For each conditional analysis, the mean HSGPA for students with the same specific value of an ACT score was computed; this was done for all ACT score values from 13 to 32. (Though the ACT score range is from 1 to 36, stable results could only be obtained for values from 13 to 32.) These conditional HSGPA means (conditional on specific values of ACT scores) were computed for all 13 years from 1991 to 2003. The students taking the ACT differed from year to year. It was assumed that students with the same ACT score had the same average level of achievement across all 13 years. An increase in these conditional HSGPAs over time would indicate grade inflation. The student samples were so large as to make formal statistical hypothesis testing unnecessary, because even the smallest difference would result in statistical significance. Instead, descriptive results are presented in several tables and graphs, and effect sizes are used to judge the practical significance of the results. Table 1 contains gender, ethnicity, and grade at time of ACT testing proportions for the 13 years. Over the time period studied, there was a small decrease in the proportion of white students and a small increase in the proportion of African-American and Hispanic students. The proportion of males also decreased. The results in Table 1 Table 2 . There are several differences worth noting. The first is twelfth-grade English."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Demographics", "text": "The proportion of students who completed twelfth-grade English steadily declined from 0.62 in 1991 to 0.52 in 2003. The group of three mathematics courses, algebra 2, geometry, and advanced mathematics, shows substantial increases over the 13 years. Computer science shows a 0.10 decline over the 13 years. Finally, the proportions of students having completed chemistry, world history, and geography increased from 0.06 to 0.10 over the 13 years. Changes in completion proportions for other courses are smaller and less significant.\nThe changes over time in the proportion of students completing certain courses at the time of ACT testing could have affected ACT test scores over time. The ACT is an achievement test designed to measure the content of many of these 23 courses. From the proportion changes noted, one might have expected over time a very slight decrease in ACT English scores, an increase in ACT Mathematics scores, and a small increase in ACT Composite scores. As shortly will be seen all of the ACT scores increased over time, though not in a steady manner, and the increases were small relative to the increase in HSGPA. However, the ACT Mathematics score shows the greatest increase, while the ACT English score shows the smallest increase. It also is of interest to examine average grades in the 23 courses over the 13 years. Table 3 contains average grades on a scale of 0 to 4 for the years 1991 to 2003 for each of the 23 courses used in computing HS overall GPA. In the second column of Table 3 is the 2003 average grade minus the 1991 average grade for each course. These average grade differences do not appear to be particularly unusual for the courses that had substantial changes in the proportion of students completing them. Twelfth grade English has the largest grade increase of all courses, but its grade increase is not that much greater than that observed in other courses. Advanced mathematics has the second lowest grade increase after calculus, but it is a specialized course taken by only a moderate proportion of students. Though significant changes in the proportion of students completing 8 of the 23 courses did occur over the 13 years, those 8 courses did not display unusual grade increase. All 23 of the courses in Table 3 show positive grade increases, and all but 3 show grade increases greater than 0.20 over the 13 years. Marginal Analyses Table 4 contains sample sizes, means, standard deviations, and correlations for HS overall GPA and ACT Composite score for all students and all 13 years. Only students with ACT Composite scores between 13 and 32 are included in the analysis. This is done to keep the marginal and conditional analyses consistent with one another. This range of ACT scores includes most of the tested students; as can be seen, the sample sizes for all years are large.\nWhile the HS overall GPA means increased steadily from year to year, The last column in Table 4 contains the correlations between HS overall GPA and ACT\nComposite score for the 13 years. The correlations are very stable from year to year; they are essentially equal for all years. The values of the correlations are fairly typical for HS overall GPA and ACT Composite score (Woodruff, 2003a) . The values of the correlation are high when one considers the wide variability in grading standards from high school to high school (Woodruff, 2003b ). It appears that the grade inflation that is occurring is not decreasing the correlation between HS overall GPA and ACT Composite score. (Cohen, 1988) , and 0.25 is 6.25% of the 0 to 4 HSGPA range.\nThe correlations between HS English GPA and English ACT score are smaller than their overall and Composite counterparts, and they do slightly decrease over the 13 years. Their smaller size is likely due to the shorter length of their components. Table 6 contains similar statistics as Table 4 and Table 5 but for HS mathematics GPA and ACT Mathematics score. Again, while the HS mathematics GPA means increased steadily from year to year, the ACT Mathematics means vary up and down, but end the 13 years with a gain. The sample sizes for the various years differ slightly in Table 4, Table 5 , and Table 6 . In selecting the students for the three analyses the condition that the ACT score be between 13 and 32 was applied to the specific ACT score for each analysis. This resulted in small differences in the sample sizes for the three different analyses."}, {"section_title": "Conditional Analyses", "text": "The conditional analyses track over time the HSGPA of students with specific ACT score values. It is assumed that students with the same ACT score have, on average, the same level of achievement in different years. Therefore, any increase in their HSGPA over time is evidence of grade inflation, and no adjustments for changes over time in achievement have to be made. Such an approach yields a simpler analysis of grade inflation. It does have a limitation. Students with high ACT scores tend to have high HSGPA's, and this produces a ceiling effect on grade inflation. As will be seen, because grades cannot exceed 4.0, grade inflation for students with high ACT scores is less than that for students with low ACT scores. This is a result of the ceiling effect of HSGPA. The lines also tend to be steeper between 1991 and 1995 indicating that this was a period of greater grade inflation as compared to the latter years. Figure 3 and Figure 4 present the results of the analysis involving the ACT English score and HS English GPA. Figure 3 is similar to Figure 1 but is for English. The vertical axis in Figure 3 goes from 2.55 to 3.85, whereas the vertical axis in Figure 1 goes from 2.30 to 3.85. The curves in Figure 3 are not as smooth as the curves in Figure 1 . HS English GPA is based on only 5 courses whereas HS overall GPA is based on 23 courses, and the ACT Composite score is the average of 4 tests whereas English is just one test. HS English GPA and ACT English are shorter measures than their composite counterparts, and so are somewhat less stable; hence their curves are not as smooth as the curves in Figure 1 , even though the sample sizes are as large as in The lines also tend to be steeper between 1991 and 1998, though this trend is not as pronounced as it is with HS overall GPA, indicating that this was a period of greater grade inflation as compared to latter years. "}, {"section_title": "Summary and Discussion", "text": "Because the ACT is an objective measure of high school academic achievement, unvarying over time, and equally applicable to all students, one can conclude from this study that a moderate amount of high school grade inflation occurred between 1991 and 2003. The marginal analyses indicated the average amount of grade inflation for this 13 year period to be about 0.25 on the 0-to-4 HSGPA scale. The effect sizes for this average amount of grade inflation varied for the three areas due to differences in their standard deviations: HS overall GPA 0.43, HS English GPA 0.37, and HS mathematics GPA 0.33. These effect size are in the moderate-to-small range (Cohen, 1988) . For grades on a scale with a range from 0 to 4, 0.25 represents 6.25% of that range, so in that sense high school grades have inflated by 6.25% between 1991 and 2003. This inflation in HSGPA is over and above any concomitant increase in average high school achievement as measured by the ACT, except, perhaps, for mathematics. ACT Mathematics had an effect size increase of 0.087 between 1991 and 2003. In terms of effect sizes, the ACT Mathematics effect size increase is about 26% of the HS mathematics GPA effect size increase.\nIn these terms, one could attribute 26% of the HS mathematics GPA increase to an increase in mathematics achievement as measured by the ACT Mathematics test. This small increase over time in mathematics achievement would agree with the increase over time in the proportions of 25 students completing courses in algebra 2, geometry, and advanced mathematics at the time of ACT testing. If one only attributes 74% of the increase in HS mathematics GPA to grade inflation, then its effect size is reduced to 0.24, and its increase on the grade scale of 0 to 4 is reduced to only 5%.\nThe conditional analyses presented in Figure 1 through Figure 6 confirm the results of the marginal analyses. The magnitude of grade inflation is in the 0.20 to 0.34 range for ACT scores in the low to middle region of the ACT score range. In the upper region of the ACT score range, grade inflation decreases, but this is due to a ceiling effect. Students with high ACT scores tend to have high HSGPAs, and because HSGPA cannot exceed 4.0, this limits the amount of grade inflation that can occur for students with high ACT scores. The score range where grade inflation was highest also was the score range with the largest number of examinees. The number of examinees with high ACT scores was much less than the number of examinees with low and moderate ACT scores.\nVarious procedures are included in the development of the different forms of the ACT to ensure that it is measuring the same content from year to year, and that it has the same statistical properties from year to year. The ACT scores tended to vary up and down over the 13 years, though with an overall gain, but the HSGPAs tended to steadily increase from one year to the next. These characteristics support the conclusion that the increase in HSGPA between 1991 and 2003 is due to grade inflation, rather than to an increase in the average level of achievement.\nFurther, the conditional analyses completely controlled for any gain in achievement as measured by the ACT."}]
