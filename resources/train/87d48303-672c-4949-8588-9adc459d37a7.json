[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Corona viruses are giant viruses with positive single stranded RNA genomes with characteristic crown like structures called spikes (Adhikari, et al., 2020) . These viruses are widespread in animals and bats, but very few are reported to affect humans. By the end of December 2019, there was a cluster of pneumonia-like severe respiratory illnesses in Wuhan, China, and it is reported that a novel coronavirus is responsible (Binnicker,2020) . The recent emergence of a novel coronavirus is named as SARS-CoV2 due to its similarities with the past pandemics of coronaviruses, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (2002) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (2012) (Guo, et al., 2020) . On March 11 th 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the coronavirus disease (CoViD-19), a pandemic and as per the situation reports on June 10 th , 2020, there stands 7, 145, 539 confirmed cases and 408, 025 deaths across the world (www.who.int.) The virus is airborne and the symptoms include fever, cough, gastrointestinal disorders, causes cytokine storm, and ultimately death. Spread of the virus is due human to human transmission and thereby community transmission at an alarmingly increased rate (Bedford, et al., 2020; Balaji, 2020) Research is growing in leaps and bounds across the world to investigate effective interventions to considerably stop the spread of contagious novel coronavirus (Selvaraj, 2020) . Currently studies including reverse vaccinology (Enayatkhani, 2020) , deep learning networks in the diagnosis [8] , are proposed. There are 2,251 studies under evaluation by clinical trials (clinicaltrials.gov/) including dozens of antiviral drugs like ramdesvir, and favipiravir (ElAsnaoui, 2020) (www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov) mRNA therapies (Thanh Le et al. 2020) , and diagnostics for CoViD-19. To deal with the difficult situation advancements of computational biology techniques, offer fast paced diagnostics and solutions (Hendaus, 2020) whereas a combination of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics approaches will join the dots to arrive at the key to curb the viral pathogenesis from all possible directions (Gupta, 2020 , S\u00f6derholm, 2016 . Pan-genome analysis is a method to enumerate from the entire repertoire of genomes or coding sequences, the core genes that are shared by all the strains and accessory genes that are shared in the subset of genes. The core genomes summarily contain the majority of genes involved in viral life cycle and multiplication whereas dispensable or accessory genes are minimally essential to the viral pathogenesis (Xiao, 2015) . Small interfering RNAs are exogenous, which have an external origin and enter the cell during an RNA viral infection (Ding, 2011) . They are recognised by dicer-drosha complex systems as exogenous nucleic acids, which are processed by the argonaute protein and initiate cleavage of the exogenous RNAs such as the viral genome or viral mRNA (Kemp, 2009 ). Hence the viral amplification and pathogenesis are restricted. As we already know molecular docking, quantitative structure activity relationships and molecular dynamics altogether offer an excellent source of drug screening and development. The decisive aspect of the computational approaches is dependent on the analysis of large datasets and arriving at an accurate conclusion (Hasin, 2017 ). Viral pathogenesis is multifaceted and hence the investigation adhered in the study would be the need of the hour. This study aims to identify the promising core genome fragments from the complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and small RNA transcripts that can target the core genes. A comprehensive analysis of conserved genes across multiple isolates proposes to reveal potential protein targets. The research as well focuses on drug repurposing of already available drugs using high throughput molecular screening protocols, in addition we intend to identify potent natural compound inhibitors of the chosen target protein. The present study has extensively evaluated the SARS-CoV2 geneome to curb and evade viral pandemic."}, {"section_title": "Pan genome analysis", "text": "A total of 942 sequences representing all the countries were retrieved and pan genome analysis was performed using the Nucmer algorithm of the Spine webserver, and predicted the conserved core genome fragments along with the accessory genome fragments (Wu et al., 2018) . The top ten core genome fragments were clustered using clustage tool (Ozer et al. 2018) . Genes coded by both core and accessory fragments were predicted based on the ab initio gene finding program FGENESH (Salamov, 2020) .

The siRNAs with ~20 base pairs are exogenous and are proven to suppress viral pathogenesis (Levanova, 2018) The preliminary step was to identify the siRNAs already available in the database VirSiRNA (Thakur, 2011) with the core fragments being the query sequences due to the fact that off target effects are reduced and strong antiviral activity (Fakhr, 2016) . From the resultant 196 hits of siRNA predicted for SARS virus, mutually efficient against SARS COV-2, only those with high silencing efficiency above the threshold of 85% were filtered. The guide strands and the 3' UTR matching seed regions were predicted with high scores and matches above 4, respectively. Few additional siRNAs were modeled from the core genomes using InvivoGen's siRNA wizard software. Understanding virus host interaction is the most significant feature in any viral pathogenesis (B\u00f6sl, 2019 ) and so predicting the host genes targeted by the viral core genes.

All the retrieved 3-D compounds were prepared and optimized with the ligprep module using OPLS 2005 force field.

Pharmacokinetic properties such as atom-based LogP, Molecular weight, membrane permeability, intestinal absorption, skin permeability levels, P-glycoprotein substrate or inhibitor are significant in determining the absorption levels of drugs. The distribution of drugs depend on the blood-brain barrier descriptors. Drugs acting as substrates or inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 enzymes represent their metabolism ability whereas toxicity can be predicted based on AMES toxicity, hERG inhibition and LD50 parameters (Han et al. 2019 ). These properties were predicted computationally to deduce the druggability of natural compounds."}, {"section_title": "Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) using python", "text": "QSAR based virtual screening predicts a large set of active molecules with the desired activity.

This method is more useful in understanding the structure activity relationships. Feature selection was done for the predicted variables by removing the null values and the insignificant variables less than the threshold of 0.1% (Kurdekar, 2014) . The molecules that adhered to the Lipinski's rule of five were filtered to create training and test sets.

This target is one of the vastly studied protein targets is the SARS-CoV2 main protease which is also called M PRO and 3CL Pro which is essential for processing of polyproteins from viral mRNA (Jin, 2020; Enmozhi, 2016 ) . Though there are enormous silico studies performed with main protease as target, the same protein is again taken as target because it is the predominant core gene obtained from pangenomics and has lots of significance in the viral pathogenesis (Gyebi, 2020; Friesner, 2006) .
