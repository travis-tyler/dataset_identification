[{"section_title": "", "text": "For approximately a decade, an optimistic attitude concerning demand for political scientists, particularly teachers of political science at all levels, has prevailed. 1 It was part of a wider set of attitudes shared by the higher education community generally, encouraged by the governmental education agencies and helped along by the attitudes of legislators, public educators, parents and citizens. But recent indications have raised questions about this view. 2"}, {"section_title": "The Survey and Its Findings", "text": "To provide information on the employment supply and demand situation for political scientists, a survey of graduate departments in political science was conducted for the Association's Committee on Program Planning and Review, Council, and members. The survey consisted of a brief questionnaire sent out with a covering letter from the Chairman of the Committee, Frank J. Sorauf, to graduate department chairmen. The questionnaire requested information on political science Ph.D.'s or candidates entering the job market, new graduate student admissions, and positions being filled in the graduate departments. 3 The first mailing took place on February 18 and the second mailing was made a month later. Of the 93 doctorate-granting departments, 76 or 82% responded. 4 The results can be summarized as follows. 1. After an increase of 40% over the past two years in the number of people entering the job market, 1970 and 1971 appear to be a period 2 One indicator of concern about employment in political science has been registration in the Association's Personnel Service. Normally membership in the service falls off abruptly from over a thousand, after January (when all memberships expire) to a few hundred as those who have found jobs or lose interest in following the job market drop out of the service. The buildup of new members then takes place slowly, reaching a peak toward the end of the year. In 1970, this trend was dramatically reversed, with no drop-off in membership at all at the end of the membership year. 3 See Appendix for questionnaire. 4 Since the non-responding institutions were known adjustments could be made for them in the tabulation of responses for questions 1 and 2. of peak supply for political scientists emerging from professional training, over 1100 each year. There is virtually no increase (3%) expected from 1970 to 1971, with an 8% decline in market entry the following year. (Figure 1) 2. New graduate students admitted for the academic year 1970 were approximately 2500, while departments anticipated admitting 2100 for 1971. This 16% drop would represent a return almost to the 1966 level of 2000 entering political science graduate students. 5 ( Figure 2 The survey included only doctorate-granting departments. Thus it did not cover M.A. granting departments and the four year colleges with political science departments (about 1000), nor did it include the less defined market of colleges without political science departments, the expanding number of junior and community colleges, or non-academic employment. 6 The master's degree and four year college departments were surveyed separately by Martin O. Heisler, Director of Graduate Placement at the University of Maryland, in cooperation with the Association. 7 The Survey of Earned Doctorates shows that the number of Ph.D.'s awarded in political      "}, {"section_title": "\"Prestige\" and Other Departments", "text": "To trace the effects of the market situation on the internal structure of the discipline of political science, separate tabulations were also made for departments rated \"distinguished\" and \"strong\" in the Cartter survey. 9 Those institutions, numbering 18, were compared with all other institutions. The prestige schools as a group have normally produced about 40% of political scientists coming onto the market although this group of institutions is only Vs of the total number of departments. The difference between the two groups of schools can be seen in Figure 1 with the peaking taking place this year among prestige schools, while for others the momentum continues through next year. On the admissions questions, the difference is more marked. Among prestige schools, admissions will drop about 25% from this year to next as projected by the chairmen, while for other institutions the drop is less than 10%. (Figure 2) The prestige schools account for about 25% of the graduate school openings each year, 50 or so, with the same proportion as among all institutions -half -being new positions. This is true for last year, this year and 1971, a stable prediction given the trends in admission and production. (Figure 3) which will be created by the entry of students admitted during the high admissions era will make new job situations in political science. What could happen would be the movement of trained political scientists into the junior and community colleges, secondary schools and non-academic employment such as private and non-profit policy research or governmental program analysis. This would include the \"enrichment\" model for higher education now being forecast Dy Falk and others in the light of tightening academic markets. 12 It raises the question of the adequacy of a \"filter-down\" or \"bumping\" process, since oversupply is now being recognized in the secondary teaching field, with the possibility of a \"floor\" being established below which Ph.D.'s are not welcomed, or will not be satisfied."}, {"section_title": "Information on the Marketplace", "text": "As most of the information on employment in higher education, the results of this exploratory survey should be used with some restraint. One of the side-effects of a slack job market is the lack of attention to its operation, and the kind of information needed to detect change is not highlighted. Another lack in information on political science is the propensity of some statistical sources to classify all social sciences in one category. For instance NDEA Fellowships are now approximately one third of the number of such fellowships two years ago, yet the changes this means in political science must be inferred from aggregate figures. Office of Education statistics on the demand for college teachers suffer from the same deficiency. The recent National Research Council study on the academic employment situation, which indicated \"unemployment\" of 1969 Ph.D.'s in social sciences as .7%, used that same inclusive, thus somewhat uninformative, category.' 6"}, {"section_title": "Note on the Survey", "text": "The questionnaire used in the APSA survey called for some choices on the part of chairmen which the language of the questionnaire did not define for them. \"Ph.D. candidates or new Ph.D.'s seeking academic employment\" could be interpreted according to the formal categories of the institution or vary from those who must find a job to those who are \"looking around\" and not certain of market entry. Asking for candidates \"admitted\" left open the possibility that admissions and enrollments differ. And those questions that call for estimates of future numbers are obviously just that. "}, {"section_title": "A Survey of the Graduate Academic Marketplace in Political Science", "text": "Residual differences between market entry and graduate student admissions figures in the APSA survey are assumed to be caused by attrition. Tabulations were adjusted in Figure 1 for partial information (no response for a year while providing information on another), and for the non-responding institutions in Figures 1 and 2. A continuity model was used to adjust partial information, using comparable data for nearest subsequent year, with 1969-70 as a base since there was complete response information for it. This adjustment builds in a slight static bias. Non-response in Figure 1 was adjusted by projecting from the National Academy of Sciences doctoral survey data, 1960-1966, a factor which (accounting for growth and non-degree market entry), when compared as a possible check, agreed with the proportion of nonresponding departments. These limits on the survey information mean the figures should be used carefully. Since the purpose of the survey, however, was to provide information fairly rapidly on a subject on which almost no data has been available, the value of the survey is that it 1) emphasizes the importance of collecting and distributing such information on the discipline in as complete a form as possible, 2) illustrates several trends affecting supply and demand which converge in the market of any given period, and 3) contains information for establishing some idea of where we are now."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In the face of a great deal of doubt about the direction of the present job market in political science, it may be well to remember that the employment market is cyclic, and there have been other periods when jobs seemed scarce. In one year during the 1930's, for instance, there were only four openings for teachers of political science in graduate schools in the United States. But there was balance, in that there were also only four new Ph.D.'s, and each was interviewed for each job!\"The nomi-nee for President-Elect of the APSA, Heinz Eulau, has written of his entry onto the political science job market. In June, 1941, when I was issued my walking papers by the University, properly certified as a Ph.D., there were no teaching jobs to be hadat least none of the kind I might have cared for. 1 * He was voicing a similar reaction to a restricted market situation which illustrates that it may not be the jobs that are scarce, but the jobs the individual expected to obtain. Thus instead of widespread unemployment in political science, what we are likely to see -and are now seeing -is a widespread readjustment of expectations about the type of jobs with which one will be satisified. Hans Rosenhaupt, President of the Woodrow Wilson Foundation discussing those trained as scholar-teachers, has said: Sooner or later, many will have to accept jobs which, while socially useful and intellectually challenging -and, incidentally, decently paiddo not carry the prestige of academic appointments at the leading institutions.\" The prospects for political science are not bleak, but cautionary, and the trends indicated in the survey are problematic enough to suggest that we are just beginning to see the structure of political science as a profession."}]
