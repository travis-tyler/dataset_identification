[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Award Number: N00014-11-1-0122 http://www.ametsoc.org/amsedu\nThe Maury Project is an oceanography-based, graduate-level, teacher professional development program designed to promote the scientific literacy of young people by improving the background of pre-college teachers on the physical foundations of oceanography. This is accomplished through a process of training the trainers at a two-week workshop held at the U.S. Naval Academy and subsequently via single-topic modules that Maury peer trainers present in sessions throughout the United States. By increasing the scientific knowledge of teachers, the Maury Project is ultimately directed towards attracting precollege students, including underrepresented minorities, to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics studies. This is in close alignment with the ONR mission to \"nurture the next generations of researchers for the future of the Navy and Marine Corps.\"\nThis project was designed to meet the following objectives:\n(a) Master teachers will be trained to be peer trainers and resource persons on the physical foundations of selected oceanographic topics and/or issues.\n(b) AMS will prepare and provide self-contained, single-topic, teacher-enhancement instructional modules for use by Maury peer trainers in 1-to 2-hour training sessions.\n(c) Maury peer trainers will arrange and conduct training sessions for other teachers, with support from the AMS.\n(d) AMS will develop and maintain a national network of oceanography peer trainers and resource persons.\n(e) AMS will prepare and disseminate a variety of instructional resource materials on the physical foundations of oceanography and related topics, which will be adapted by teachers for use in their own classrooms."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "(b) AMS will prepare and provide self-contained, single-topic, teacher-enhancement instructional modules for use by Maury peer trainers in 1-to 2-hour training sessions.\n(c) Maury peer trainers will arrange and conduct training sessions for other teachers, with support from the AMS.\n(d) AMS will develop and maintain a national network of oceanography peer trainers and resource persons.\n(e) AMS will prepare and disseminate a variety of instructional resource materials on the physical foundations of oceanography and related topics, which will be adapted by teachers for use in their own classrooms. "}, {"section_title": "APPROACH", "text": "There are three major components to this program: an annual summer workshop for master pre-college teachers, the production of teacher enhancement instructional resource materials, and the peer-training of additional teachers. The intent is to provide a core group of teachers with the knowledge and instructional resources to enable them, in turn, to train a large number of their peers on selected oceanography topics. In-class use of these topics by those peer-trained will enhance learning experiences for K-12 students. Maury peer trainers receive three graduate-level credits through the State University of New York's College at Brockport upon completion of program requirements."}, {"section_title": "WORK COMPLETED", "text": "In summer 2012, a two-week workshop for 24 pre-college teachers on the physical foundations of selected oceanographic topics was held at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD. The USNA Oceanography Department makes available to the Maury Project essentially all of its outstanding facilities for the workshop, including an oceanographic research vessel and the Hendrix Oceanography Laboratory, which features a NOAA Tide Station, and a wet laboratory, which circulates water from the Chesapeake Bay. Participants have an intensive, hands-on experience in oceanography, which they are excited to share with others via peer-training workshops they conduct in their local school districts and communities."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "End-of-workshop survey questionnaires are administered on the last day of each Maury Project summer workshop. Data collected at the end of the summer 2012 workshop is summarized below from the 22 participants who completed the survey. (Two participants could not complete the survey.)\nWhen the 22 participants were asked for:\n\u2022 their overall rating of the Maury Project in terms of its educational value, all 22 gave the highest response of \"excellent.\"\n\u2022 the long-term effect on their teaching, 21 reported \"great deal\" and 1 \"some.\"\n\u2022 the long-term effect on their curriculum development, 20 reported \"great deal\" and 1 \"some\"\n\u2022 the long-term effect on training of colleagues, 21 reported \"great deal\" and 1 did not respond\nWhen asked \"Has your perception of the value of the Navy changed as a result of your workshop participation?\" 21 reported \"increased\" and 1 reported \"remained the same.\"\nWhen asked \"Has your perception of the value of NOAA changed as a result of your workshop participation?\" 17 reported \"increased\" and 5 reported \"remained the same.\"\nWhen asked how they would rank the Maury workshop with other summer workshop experiences they have had since becoming a teacher, all participants indicated it was the best or among the very best.\nWhen asked if they would recommend that the Maury Project USNA workshop be offered in the future to other teachers, all participants responded affirmatively. To see the multiplying effect of this program, consider that since its inception about 2100 workshops have been conducted by Maury peer trainers across the country, reaching over 33,000 teachers, each of whom reaches about 100 students daily. Originally funded by the NSF for 3 summers starting in 1994, the existing Maury Project Summer Workshops at the Naval Academy received additional NOAA, Navy, and AMS support. Funding from ONR assures the continuation of the workshops through summer 2013. ONR has committed substantial support towards this continuation and is now its major sponsor."}, {"section_title": "TRANSITIONS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "RELATED PROJECTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "AMS Ocean Studies", "text": "Building on the experiences gained in the Maury Project and the DataStreme Ocean distance-learning teacher enhancement course, the AMS developed an introductory college-level oceanography course, entitled AMS Ocean Studies. Since national implementation in fall 2005, 152 undergraduate institutions and 19 high schools have offered the course to more than 18,000 students. AMS Ocean Studies would not exist without the experiences gained from the Maury Project, including materials development. A major benefit of the AMS Ocean Studies course is that it is reaching hundreds of preservice pre-college teachers."}, {"section_title": "AMS Diversity Projects", "text": "The AMS Ocean Studies Diversity Project, an offshoot of our work with the AMS Ocean Studies undergraduate course, was a direct result of an NSF grant and NOAA support to provide special workshop opportunities for faculty at institutions serving significant numbers of minority students. "}, {"section_title": "Consortium for Ocean Leadership Partnership", "text": "In fall 2010 and spring 2011, PI Brey attended School of Rock workshops for educators on the JOIDES Resolution ocean-drilling ship. At the 2011 workshop, Brey presented the idea for formal collaboration on a grant to bring minority-serving institution faculty members who offer AMS Ocean Studies and/or AMS Climate Studies to a special School of Rock. The goal is to train MSI faculty to infuse curricula involving paleoclimate data from ocean cores, thereby providing MSI students with opportunities to use real research data in the classroom. The idea came to fruition in 2012 when Consortium for Ocean Leadership was awarded an NSF OEDG planning grant to collaborate with AMS and other partners. The School of Rock workshop was held at the Texas A&M University Gulf Coast Repository in June 2012 for 12 MSI faculty, and the group is planning a more extensive grant submission."}]
