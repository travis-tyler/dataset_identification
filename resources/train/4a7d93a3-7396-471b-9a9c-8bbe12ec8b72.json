Introduction", "text": "In this paper we analyze the system of pre-entry coaching before going to the university and its impact on the final results of the recently introduced national exam in Russia.\nThe Russian system of admission to higher education is undergoing a major institutional transformation: during the Soviet period and up to 2009 each university set its own specific entry exams, thus forcing university hopefuls to pass through exams both at high school and at higher education institution. Since 2009 all Russian universities are obliged to admit students on the basis of results of the Unified State Examination (USE), which is a system of standardized tests on different subjects.\nThe main idea of introduction of the USE was to make admission procedures more transparent and to give more educational opportunities for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Besides, prospective students can now prepare for the USE without specific investment concerning any particular university, and make the choice of where to apply at a later time. This simplifies the access to university as it decreases transaction costs of pre-entry coaching. Pre-entry coaching still exists however, but now it is done for the centralized test, rather than for and by each university separately. The goal of this paper is to find out to what extent such pre-test training pays off in terms of higher test scores on the centralized test.\nThe literature (e.g. Juerges, Schneider and Buechel, 2005) predicts positive effects of centralized exams on student achievement as well as on teacher effort, because under this system the results are more valuable signals on the labor market than those of non-unified exams (Bishop, 1995 (Bishop, , 1997 . Second, such systems provide a set of incentives both for teachers and students for cooperation \u00abtoward the goal of students' academic progress\u00bb (Schiller, Muller, 2000, p. 74). Third, standardized tests lower the costs of monitoring associated with school performance as they can serve as indicators of the quality of teaching as well. Hence, teaching quality can be monitored, compared across schools and (possibly) rewarded. Finally, standardized testing can raise competition between high schools, because educational outcomes allow making comparisons across schools and students due to the fact that it provides uniformity across exam programs and the grading system. As a result, competition can lead to increase in quality of secondary education. Consequently, uniform requirements and scale of grading are powerful tools of analysis student achievement throughout the country, as uniform test score are comparable and avoid biases which existed before introduction of the USE.\nThis paper is devoted to the study and evaluation different factors that determine real USE scores. Since higher achievement in terms of scores is positively associated with the probability of successful admission, factors which determine the USE results can affect final educational outcomes.\nInformation about real scores can be interpreted as an output of educational production function. As the Unified State Examination and its unified scores can be considered as the 'output', we can measure and evaluate factors which determine such 'output' and compare the results among students from different socio-economic backgrounds. There is a lot of research concerning empirical evaluation of educational production function, i.e. assessment of factors which determine academic achievement (e.g. Polachek, Kniesner, 1978 Powers and Rock, 1999).\nIn this work we will examine the significance of pre-entry efforts as factors of educational production function. In other words, the main question is \"Does investment in pre-entry coaching improves the results of the USE?\" The next question is concerned with family inputs. Which factors concerning family characteristics (for instance, parental education, family income, and current academic achievement) affect students' actual USE scores? If the impact of those variables is positive, as a consequence, these factors can influence college choice via actual scores, so college choice can be determined by family factors (inputs) as well.\nIn our analysis we use the data from the questionnaires of first year university students and their parents who live in 16 biggest Russian cities. Questions contained information on SEScharacteristics, abilities, high school features, patterns of pre-entry coaching, USE results as well as characteristics of the chosen university.\nOur results show that parental education, family income, student's abilities and whether or not the student graduated from a gymnasium or magnet school are significant predictors of USE results in Russian, Mathematics and the average USE score. Characteristics of pre-entry courses (duration of a program as well as total fee) have a positive influence on USE scores, but the effect of this kind of pre-entry training is moderate (coached students can gain approx. 3 points out of 100 compared to uncoached ones). Attending classes with tutors has a significant (but still moderate) effect only on the USE score in Russian.\nThis remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes advantages of the USE as an external mechanism for evaluating student achievement, as well as the educational production function approach towards estimation factors which determine academic success.\nLiterature on effects of pre-entry coaching is analyzed. Data and methodology are described in Section III. Section IV describes results of regression analysis. Section V includes concluding remarks."}, {"section_title": "II.", "text": "The Unified state examination, educational production function and"}, {"section_title": "effects of coaching", "text": "The Unified state examination is an external examination system (an analogue of the SAT system in the U.S. or matriculation exams in Finland). This examination is uniform and intended for all Russian school graduates. Every school graduate can sit the set of exams and apply to different universities (in 2010 the maximum number of applications that one person can complete was 5, but this limitation is formal only as there are no legal authorities which monitor the application process).\nEvery high school graduate may sit the set of USE tests only once a year. If he (she) fails, he (she) can attempt to do this next year for free. Note, that only two subjects are obligatory:\nRussian (National language) and Mathematics. Other subjects are required by different universities according to their specific field of study. After collecting the requests, education institutions (universities) rank the applications on the basis of the sum of required exam scores and take a decision on matriculation. The process of admission to the university has two stages.\nFirst, the universities rank all the requests from prospective students and draw a line. After that those students who are admitted have to present to the university their certificates (scripts).\nTypically there will be vacant places after that, because one student can apply to several universities, so he (she) can be admitted to more than one institution as well. Having received the scripts, the universities rank students again and draw a line for the second time. Hence, there is a chance for those prospective students who were not admitted on the first stage to enter a university of their choice.\nBefore introduction of the USE every Russian university had its own admission procedure.\nThe universities' autonomy in admission procedures often led to high selectivity, and school graduates were forced to adjust their strategies in regard to the specific institution in which they were interested. Graduates, who wanted to enter a university with specific entry requirements, were advised that they should be aware of the program of examinations of that university. In order to prepare for the examination properly and meet entry requirements (e.g, program and\nformat of entry exams), prospective students were required either to attend special coaching courses provided by the university or to have additional classes with tutors, who usually worked in the same institution. In other words, they chose the direction of specific investment (both financial and temporal) in the moment when they were hardly aware about what university to attend (up to 1 year before matriculation). This process was inefficient (in terms of timing of college choice, as students had to decide on where to attend, as well as the direction of specific investment in pre-entry coaching early before the exams) and imposed restrictions on college choice. Moreover, it created opportunities for corruption in universities, as members of admission board could influence the result of admission.\nActual test scores can be considered as values of the educational production function (Hanushek, 1971; Polachek, Kniesner, Harwood, 1978 and other authors, we will use exam scores as a proxy. Second, which level of aggregation should be chosen: city, school, class, or student? In this paper we will rely on microdata on individual students, as we should capture direct links between student achievement and resources spent as investment in pre-entry coaching (Hanushek, Rivkin and Taylor, 1996) .\nDepending on the structure of the sample and the particular dataset, researchers have drawn different conclusions. Most of this research is concentrated on impact of schooling resources on student achievement. Hanushek (1997) summarized the results on schooling resources and academic achievement and draw a conclusion that only 9 to 29 percent of articles reveal positive effects of schooling resources on student achievement. Fowler and Walberg (1991) examined this issue using data from 293 schools of New Jersey. As a result, such factors as percentage of students from low-income households, size of school, number of schools in a district, percentage of teachers with bachelor's degree, number of teachers per pupil, average teacher's salary, and socio-economic status of a district, were significant. In contrast, Ehrenberg and Brewer (1994), using panel data from High School and Beyond, found no relationship between teachers-per-pupil ratio and achievement. Gamoran (1996) examined effects of different types of school on final scores. It was shown from National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 data that students from private schools perform almost the same as students from public schools. Students from catholic schools scored higher than those of public schools only in Mathematics. Students from magnet schools got higher scores than other students. However, the relationship between schooling resources is still ambiguous.\nOne of the problems concerning evaluation of educational production function is endogeneity, as students' assignment to schools is not random, because parents can choose schooling institutions and corresponding resources. In order to avoid biases the method of instrumental variables is commonly accepted (Woessmann, 2005; H\u00e4kkinen et al, 2003) , however it is not always possible to find proper instruments. One of attempts to get data without endogeneity effects was Project STAR (the Tennessee Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio experiment). During this natural experiment, cohorts of pupils were randomly assigned between classes of different sizes and teachers. The result of this experiment was that students who studied in small classes performed better than those of bigger classes (Krueger, 1999) .\nDespite the ambiguity of results concerning schooling resources and student performance, there is evidence that achievement can be related to the family inputs, i.e. social background, income and level of parental education (H\u00e4kkinen et al, 2003; Woessmann, 2005) , so final results and, consequently, college choice can be determined by family factors. Hanushek and Woessmann (2010) argue that cross-country data can reveal significant institutional effects, which do not exist within country. Moreover, such analysis helps to avoid biases because of endogeneity problem. Another comparative study devoted to differences in schooling quality in Eastern European Countries (Ammermueller et al, 2005) . It draws significant differences in achievement between countries explained by different institutional settings. However, this study neglects the effects of pre-entry coaching. While cross-country analysis can be very useful, this paper focuses on Russian high school graduates' achievement.\nHowever, this could be a promising extension of the current research.\nPre-entry coaching is widespread not only in Russia, but in other countries with welldeveloped and highly competitive systems of higher education. The problem of the effect of coaching is not new. There is not so much literature on the effects of coaching, however there are some articles about significance of coaching process on achievement, where the measure of achievement is SAT score (as it was stated above, the USE in Russia has almost the same format as SAT in the U.S.). The most general conclusion is that coached students do perform better than their uncoached counterparts: on average, those students who attend special coaching programs get 15-25 SAT-points on the verbal and on the mathematical blocks more than other students (Powers, 1993) . In the review of results from a meta-analysis of a set of papers concerning effectiveness of coaching it is stated that in most cases effects of coaching are positive (although there are several studies which show negative effects), but the effect is small (Bangert-Drowns et al, 1983). However, longer programs have greater effects compared to shorter ones. Drill and practice on such tests yield greater returns as well. Becker (1990) Hence, even though most of the researchers conclude that the effects of coaching are positive, the importance of coaching (and its real influence) varies from study to study and depends on the concrete dataset (Kulik et al, 1984) . This fact drives towards the study of the effect of pre-entry coaching in Russia under new institutional conditions and standardized requirements."}, {"section_title": "III. Methodology and data description", "text": "The empirical data was obtained through the inquiry of first year university students (who were successfully admitted) and their parents in the fall 2010, i.e. at the moment when school graduates have passed all the exams and were admitted to the universities. During the inquiry 1600 households were interviewed.\nThe inquiry took place in 16 big Russian cities (with population more than 800 000 people): Moscow, St. Petersburg, Volgograd, Voronezh, Yekaterinburg, Kazan, Krasnoyarsk, Nizhny Novgorod, Novosibirsk, Omsk, Perm, Rostov-on-Don, Samara, Saratov, Ufa and Chelyabinsk. The number of households interviewed in every city was 100. After removing profiles with missing answers (to the questions about family income, as well as characteristics of pre-entry coaching, which are crucial for our goals), the size of the sample diminished to 1165 households 1 . Then the sample was weighted proportionally to the number of school graduates in the above cities in 2005.\nThere were two different questionnaires for children (school graduates) and their parents.\nOne prospective student and one parent in each household were interviewed. They answered proposed questions separately from each other in order to avoid biases in their answers.\nAs it was stated before, family, student and school characteristics can affect scores. \nDependent variables: T i -USE scores of student i in Russian, Mathematics, and the average USE score."}, {"section_title": "Independent variables:", "text": "A i -academic achievement before pre-entry training (measure of abilities); \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03bb, \u03bc -coefficients of the regression, \u03b5 -error term.\nWhen running the regression, we use sample weights.\nWe do not have the direct measure of abilities.

These marks are those from exams which pupils pass at the end of the 9 th grades. The program of the exam is uniform, although unlike the USE, it is taken at the same schools where pupils study, but still we can compare the results of 9 th graders across schools. Schools and student body are different, thus grading standards in more selective high schools can be stricter. However, the validity of the comparative analysis across different types of high schools can be justified, as we control for the type of school.\nType of school. Most of high school graduates attended comprehensive schools (61.7%).\nMore than 17% of students graduated from gymnasiums, colleges of lyceums. More than 11%\nhave Certificates from comprehensive schools with special classes, rest of students attended magnet schools. "}, {"section_title": "IV. Results", "text": "Results of the analysis of distributions of dependent variables. Before estimation the effects of different factors on USE results, we can look at the distributions of dependent variables (USE scores in Russian, Mathematics and the average score on all the subjects passed) depending on characteristics of pre-entry coaching, as well as student's socio-economic background, his (her) abilities, and type of high school. The analysis of distributions of USE scores sheds light on a number of significant relationships between student achievement and SES characteristics, as well as schooling and coaching.\nFirst of all, the type of pre-entry coaching determines the distribution of the USE results. Table 3 represents the distribution of final USE scores depending on the coaching program: preentry courses, classes with tutors, other types of coaching, self-coaching, as well as no coaching at all. We can see that enrollees, who attended pre-entry courses and classes with tutors, gain more than other high school graduates. Lowest results are for those respondents, who stated that there was no coaching for the USE at all (even no self-coaching). Total 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0%\nFamily factors, such as parental education, parental income, complete/incomplete family, as well as gender, vary between different levels of achievement. The first factor of significance is the level of parental education. In the households where parents have higher education, children get higher USE scores than in households where parents do not have higher education, i.e. they have only secondary education. Furthermore, the proportion of school graduates who get only \u00abgood\u00bb (61-80 points) and \u00abexcellent\u00bb (81-100 points) scores is higher in well-educated households and lower in other households.\nThe next significant factor of distinction between different groups of enrollees is family structure (complete or incomplete family). In households where both parents live with their children, high school graduates are more successful in terms of the USE results than those who live only with one parent. Indeed, the proportion of students who got \u00abgood\u00bb and \u00abexcellent\u00bb scores is higher in complete families (for example, more than 74% of children from complete families get more than 61 points in Russian, while only 63.4% of children from incomplete families reach the same result).\nThe USE results positively depend on parental income: the higher is the income of the household -the higher are the scores. If the majority of school graduates from low-income households received \u00abpoor\u00bb (1-40 points) and \u00abfair\u00bb (41-60 points) marks as the average USE score, approximately a half of the students from high-income families received \u00abgood\u00bb marks.\nThe same relationship is true for test results in Russian and Mathematics. Moreover, the proportion of school graduates who get only \u00abgood\u00bb and \u00abexcellent\u00bb marks is very high in \u00abwealthy\u00bb households and substantially lower in \u00abpoor\u00bb ones. Hence, as higher USE scores represent better chances to enter the university, prospective students from high-income households have more chances for successful admission to the universities of high quality.\nGender is another factor of significance. Girls are more successful in Russian, and boys get higher scores in Mathematics. For example, more than 75% of girls get 61-100 points in Russian, while only 67.4% of boys achieve the same result. Hence, USE results of high school graduates can be determined by methods of pre-entry coaching, family inputs (parental education, structure of family, family income), ability (school achievement) and school inputs (type of school), as well as gender and city. In order to measure the impact of different inputs we run regression models."}, {"section_title": "Results of regression analysis.", "text": "A. Educational production function. The results of regression analysis are represented in Table   4 .\nTo evaluate the effect of different inputs on the USE results, with the special emphasis on characteristics of pre-entry coaching, we propose different linear models, where we will use the USE scores in Russian, Mathematics and the average USE score as dependent variables. The following characteristics of pre-entry programs will be included in corresponding models:\n( Table 4 ). Hence, the effects of pre-entry coaching are small (compared to variables of achievement and type of school, see below). The main type of coaching that can improve USE results is preentry courses. But even though the effect is moderate, at the same time it is similar to effect of parental education or gymnasium effect -so in relative sense it is not that small. more than girls) and average result (boys score up to 1.9 points more than girls). Type of family 4 Here we use average meanings for duration and frequency of pre-entry courses. 5 These values represent approximated means for corresponding variables. 6000 rubles equal 200 US dollars approx.\nhas significant effect in all presented models only on average USE score: children from complete families are more successful in the terms of average score and get up to 2.2 points more than children who live either only with mother or with father. In the previous models we have described the impact of the fact of attending pre-entry programs, duration of program, as well as total fee on the USE results. Models 1-3 do not reflect neither temporary nor monetary investment in pre-entry coaching, models 4-6 deal only with temporary expenditures on courses or classes with tutors, while models 7-9 regard total fee for preparation (this indicator includes duration and monthly fee, but their effects are not separated from each other). That is why we offer an alternative specification of regression model, where we include total number of classes (at pre-entry courses or with tutors) and fee per class (that is, monthly fee divided by number of classes per month). This specification allows for analysis of temporary and monetary investment separately. The results of regression analysis are presented in Table 5 . Table 5 . The coefficients show that total duration (number of classes) of pre-entry courses as well as total duration of classes with tutors (overall effect) positively affect USE scores in Russian, Mathematics and the average USE score, although the effects are small and correspond with the previous findings. Fee per class at pre-entry courses is statistically insignificant, while monetary investment in lessons with tutors positively affect scores. We can explain this fact in the following way: usually pre-entry courses are offered by the universities, and tuition fees are almost independent of the quality of preparation program, while the fee charged by the tutor can reflect teaching quality. However, the effects of pre-entry coaching are modest.\nControl variables (family characteristics, achievement, and type of high school) have the same impact as it was described above. Such variables, as parental education, level of income, achievement (GPA in the 9 th grade), and the fact of graduation from gymnasium or magnet school positively affect all regarded USE scores. Gender is significant for USE results in Russian and Mathematics, and incomplete family matters for the average USE score. Coefficients for cities are shown in Table A2 in the Appendix.\nB. The net effect of pre-entry coaching. Real abilities of high school graduates are unobservable. That is why in previous models we used their achievement in the 9 th grade as a proxy for ability. However, one can argue that scores before starting preparatory process can be regarded not as independent variables, but as an output of educational production function, because they can be related to family inputs, school resources and so on. That is why we have constructed the variable that represents difference in achievement during the preparatory period:\ne. difference between USE score and GPA in the 9 th grade. This measure can be described as gain in achievement, and education production function in differences can provide more precise effects of pre-entry coaching. Next we run 9 regression models in specifications described above.\nAs we can see in Table 6 6 , the net effects of pre-entry coaching are almost the same as described before. The most relevant models are those where dependent variable is the difference between average USE score and GPA, because (1) it describes average improvement in results,\nand (1) we do not know the scores in Russian and Mathematics in the 9 th grade for more precise comparison (models 12, 15, 18) .\nIn these models the fact of attendance of pre-entry courses can improve the average result Table 6 . Other types of coaching have significant negative (but moderate) effect on the gain in achievement.\nAgain, control variables have significant effect on the fact of improving the result. Parental education and income are significant factors which positively affect the gain in achievement in all models. Family structure (complete or incomplete family) matters only for the difference in results in Russian (students from incomplete families perform better), while gender matters for the gain in Mathematics and average score (boys perform better than girls). Studying in gymnasiums can improve the gain in all models, while studying in magnet schools can raise the result in Mathematics as well as the average result.\nHence, we did not found any significant contradiction with the previous models of educational production function. "}, {"section_title": "V. Conclusion", "text": "The Unified State Examination is a new institution of admission to higher education.\nBefore its introduction, in the absence of national testing system each university had its own admission procedure. That system of exams was highly selective and forced students to make additional efforts in specific pre-entry coaching in order to improve their chances of successful admission. Nowadays the need for pre-entry coaching should be caused by other factors then before, as the exam is uniform (standardized) and there is a lot of literature on this test. However, the majority of high school graduates still attends extra classes and pay tuition for them. We have made an attempt to measure the effectiveness of such preparation strategies under the new examination system by estimating the influence of pre-entry coaching on final USE results.\nIn this paper we have identified and evaluated the set of factors which affect actual USE scores, with special emphasis on characteristics of pre-entry coaching. USE results are primarily determined by high school achievement before beginning of additional preparation. However, there are other significant factors but their magnitude on the final result is moderate. Pre-entry coaching matters, but only investment in pre-entry courses can improve USE results in Russian, Mathematics and the average score. However, the effect of courses is rather small and varies (on average) from 1.5 to 3.6 points.\nIn the models of educational production function there can a problem of endogeneity. One can argue that coaching choices are not random: for example, brighter students feel more secure about their final result, so they need less coaching than low-achievers. Hence, weaker high school graduates would tend to attend pre-entry courses or classes with tutors more often than high-achievers. On the other hand, brighter students can be more motivated for extra training than weaker ones. That is why they will have more incentives to attend pre-entry courses and classes with tutors. Our data show that there is no significant difference in choice of patterns of pre-entry coaching between different groups of students (some of preparations are similar regardless of scores in the 9 th grade). Hence, we can say that endogeneity effect is potentially overestimated, as the distributions of students by their achievement before starting the preparation between different types of coaching programs look similar 7 .\nUSE scores are determined by family inputs, as well as by type of school. Gender matters for USE results in Russian in Mathematics. The same results were obtained in the models, where temporary and monetary efforts were estimated separately.\nWe have built models where we estimated the gain in achievement between the 9 th and 11 th grades (during the period of pre-entry coaching). The results are almost the same as in analysis of educational production function: pre-entry courses matter and have a positive impact on the increase in achievement, but the effect is not large, and it is comparable to the effects obtained when analyzing the initial specification.\nAs a consequence, such factors as investment in pre-entry coaching, abilities, SES as well as type of high school can influence college choice via scores, so college choice can be determined not only by student abilities. However, we cannot say that those who invest more in pre-entry coaching have far more chances for successful matriculation. "}, {"section_title": "VI.
