[{"section_title": "", "text": "My first ever scientific paper was published in Bird Study. It was written with three undergraduate colleagues while I was studying botany at Cambridge University and described the results of a population survey of Slavonian Grebes Podiceps auritus at Myvatn, Iceland (Clase et al. 1960). Now, 45 years later and looking back as an ornithologist who has spent half his life on each side of the Atlantic Ocean, I have been asked by the Editor to write another contribution. I have always been intrigued by the similarities and differences in the structure of ornithology in Europe and North America and here I explore some of those differences, with emphasis on the historical development of the discipline in North America and its progress during the past 50 years. This is a personal assessment and draws more on Canadian than US examples, but considers not only the academic discipline but also the ways in which ornithology influences the broader community through bird management and conservation, a theme which has always been central to the British Trust of Ornithology (BTO). The major thesis of this presentation is that the relatively recent European settlement of North America has resulted in major differences in attitudes towards birds, their study and conservation/management, relative to those in the European countries, which the settlers had left behind. The consequences of these differences are still evident today, and are reflected in the institutions and organisations involved in ornithology. I explore some of those institutions in North America, and compare and contrast them with their equivalents in Britain, as summarized by Colin Bibby (Bibby 2003) elsewhere in this issue. My paper covers a broader period of time than his, in order to set the stage for the comparisons, but on many issues we are dealing with similar topics."}, {"section_title": "Origins of North American ornithology", "text": "It is not my intention to document in detail the origins of ornithology in North America, but rather to give a few examples of the ways in which knowledge of birds was developed and made available to ornithologists in Europe in the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries. In Europe, knowledge of birds was part of the culture of the local people and, through observation and folklore, our understanding was gained and fostered by observant members of the community. Sir Thomas Browne, a Norwich doctor of the 17th century was able to build on a considerable local knowledge when he wrote, for example, of nesting Avocets Recurvirostra avosetta and Spoonbills Platalea leucorodia in Norfolk, UK (Browne 1682). Contemporaneously, Samuel de Champlain, Governor of New France and stationed in Quebec City was writing some of the first European accounts of the avifauna of the Great Lakes of North America. Grant (1907) quotes Champlain in translation as seeing 'a large amount of game as Swans Cygnus sp., White Cranes Grus americana, Outardes [Canada Geese (Branta canadensis) FC], Ducks, Teal Anas carolinensis and Anas discors, Song Thrush, Larks, Snipe, Geese and several other kinds of fowl too numerous to mention. Of these I killed a great number which stood us in good stead while waiting for the capture of a deer'. In North America, these early explorers and settlers depended heavily on a detailed local knowledge of wildlife among the various aboriginal communities. Much of this information was shared with the early explorers and settlers, but it took many years before it became available to the European scientific culture and its North American equivalent. The ways in which this acquisition of knowledge of the North American avifauna entered the mainstream of scientific thinking can be illustrated by the activities of the Hudson's Bay Company in the 18th century. The Company, several of whose Directors were Fellows of the Royal Society in England, controlled a large part of the fur trade in the northern part of the continent and much of the early knowledge of Canadian avifauna came from their employees who worked at the various trading posts along the coast of Hudson Bay. The Hudson's Bay Company was interested not only in trade but also in science and exploration, and a few of the Factors (the men in charge of the settlements) gave considerable time to the documentation of local natural history, including the collection of bird specimens. Each settlement comprised a few European traders and local 'home' Indians, mainly Cree who camped on the outskirts of the 'factory'. A few of the employees, men such as Andrew Graham, Samuel Hearne and the physician Thomas Hutchins collected specimens, kept extensive diaries (Graham/Hutchins 1769) and/or made extensive journeys of exploration (Hearne 1795). Their knowledge of the local birds was remarkable considering the conditions of the time, and much was learned from the local Cree. Hutchins and Graham for example were aware that three distinct populations of Canada Geese Branta canadensis occur on the Hudson Bay coast of Canada, a large one, 'the large grey goose', now referred to as B. c. interior, that comprised two groups, one that nested locally and another that migrated into the area in June to moult (this was referred to as the barren goose) and a smaller race B. c. hutchinsii which nested further north and migrated along the Hudson Bay coast in spring and fall. Such knowledge shows a remarkable ability to observe and understand. Of the three men mentioned above, the most scientifically trained was Hutchins and he is the one whose name is preserved for posterity through the scientific name of a small race of Canada Goose. Hutchins worked closely with Andrew Graham (Houston 2003) and together they sent specimens and notes to Pennant, Britain's leading zoologist of the day and author of both British Zoology and Arctic Zoology with 19 species new to science. These early North Americans would never have described themselves as ornithologists but their knowledge and scientific skills were profound. While many European ornithologists, e.g. Gilbert White author of Natural History of Selbourne, were debating the relative merits of hibernation and migration as an explanation of the disappearance of many bird species in the winter months, Hutchins and Graham, seeing the massive movements of birds along the Hudson Bay coast in spring and fall had no such doubts about the primacy of migration. Through these and other routes, most North American birds were first described and became known to the centres of ornithology in Europe in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Only later was there a concerted move to a more systematic study of birds. There were two major streams of ornithology in these early days, one deriving from the museum and collecting tradition, well known and developed in Europe, and one less formalized, deriving from the need to exploit the natural resources. The museum-orientated approach, similar to that in Europe, was the earlier of the traditions in North America and derived from that in Europe. In the 18th and 19th centuries, naturalists, often themselves or their forebears from Europe, carried on the avian exploration of the continent and added to our knowledge of the local avifauna. John James Audubon, born in France, is perhaps the best-known example of this tradition. Whereas many of the specimens of the day were shipped back to European museums, the early establishment of the Smithsonian Institution by an act of Congress in Washington in 1846 (and the associated United States National Museum in 1859) showed that ornithology as a discipline in its own right was alive and well. Through the setting up of other centres such the American Museum of Natural History in New York and the National Museum of Canada in Ottawa, as well as a host of others in state and provincial capitals, the study of ornithology spread throughout the continent. In these institutions and in university zoology or biology departments that arose throughout the 20th century, ornithology as an academic discipline was fostered, with its emphasis initially on the more traditional aspects of ornithology: systematics and taxonomy, anatomy, morphology, physiology, field studies (descriptive natural history) and distribution, but later including more formally defined ecology and ethology. Organizations such as the Nuttall Ornithological Club founded initially in 1873 by two young ornithologists in Cambridge, Massachusetts, fostered this interest. Nuttall himself lived in Cambridge and was the author of A Manual of Ornithology of the United States and Canada. From the start there was the recognition that ornithology in North America depended on the USA and Canada working together. In 1876, the fledgling society produced a journal, the Bulletin of the Nuttall Ornithological Club, later to become The Auk. In August 1883, 23 members of the NOC and others met in New York and the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU) was founded. The Auk has been the official journal of the AOU since then. Although based in the USA, the AOU served amateur and professional ornithologists throughout the continent. The first article of the Bulletin of the Nuttall Ornithological Club was written by William Brewster, one of the leaders in North American ornithology, whose name is still recalled in the prestigious Brewster Award of the AOU, awarded annually for outstanding research in North American ornithology. The Wilson Ornithological Society based in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, produced its first journal under the title of Wilson Bulletin, the Ornithologists' and Oologists' Semi-Annual in 1889, showing the early connection between ornithology and the now unacceptable practice of egg collecting. Now affectionately known as the Willy Bully, the journal is still a leading outlet of scientific ornithology. The Cooper Ornithological Society, based in California and founded in 1899 initially served mainly the western part of the continent. Its first journal was called the Bulletin of the Cooper Ornithological Club of California. The next year it was transformed into The Condor and has since become a strong voice in ornithology throughout North America and beyond. Because of its proximity to Mexico and Central America, the Cooper Society has usually given a higher priority to ornithology in the southern and western parts of the North American continent, particularly Mexico. Although the museums had a high profile, the other ornithological tradition was also developing. Whereas much of Europe was fed by its agricultural produce, in North America much of the settlement of the continent depended on the abundance of wild game. As settlement progressed and institutes of higher learning and science were being established, a prime concern was for the teaching of agriculture. In order to use the resources of the continent effectively, universities established departments of agriculture, an early example being the Ontario Agricultural College (now the University of Guelph) in Guelph, Ontario, established in 1874. Most, however, were established in the first half of the 20th century. One of the important faculties of such colleges was a department of wildlife management, which provided studies designed to exploit more effectively the abundant but often declining populations of fish and wild game. These departments of wildlife management played an important role in setting the agenda for ornithological studies in North America in the 20th century. Birds were valuable to the expanding human populations of the continent and were subject to the same sorts of analysis as cattle, maize or potatoes; hence we often hear words such as harvest and resource to describe the animals and birds that were shot. Subjects of study would consist of what would later be called population ecology, distribution, capture and collecting methods as well as topics more familiar in Europe such as anatomy, nomenclature and a small amount of physiology and pathology. Because of the utilitarian nature of wildlife studies in North America there was a need to study the animal in its natural surroundings and so ecology (though not called that in the early days) and behaviour played a role in ornithological studies from the outset. There was also a strong concern about declining species if they were of economic importance, and a need to understand wildlife diseases and how to control predators. There were two important corollaries of this aspect of the development of ornithology in North America. First there was a strong bias in the types of birds thought to be important to governments and departments of wildlife management. Three types of birds were the major focus of study. Waterfowl, (Anseriformes and some Rallidae) were a prime source of food as were the Upland Game, comprising mainly Galliformes, but also including Columbidae and those Charadridae, such as Woodcock Scolopax minor, Snipe Capella delicata and plovers Charadrius sp. that were regularly hunted. The third group was the predators, comprising the Falconiformes, Strigiformes and Corvidae, species considered important for their depredation of livestock and wild game. Ornithology viewed in this way had a strong sense of good and evil. The first two groups were 'good' birds in need of our wise harvesting, the predators were 'evil' and targeted for elimination. Taverner (1934), author of the first comprehensive handbook of the birds of Canada typifies this view in describing an altercation between American Crows Corvus brachyrhynchos and a Great Horned Owl Bubo virginianus, with the quote 'When knaves fall out, honest men prosper.' The second corollary was that, unlike in Europe, birds in North America were of national economic significance. As such they were of concern to elected governments. In Europe one tends to think of North America as being more committed to free enterprise and less regulated by governments than Europe, but in the field of ornithology the reverse is true. Governments at federal, state (US and Mexico) and provincial (Canada) levels had an economic incentive to manage wild game efficiently for their citizens, and no private bodies had the resources or organizational ability to act for the benefit of wildlife. Wildlife, as one component of the natural resources of the region, was under the jurisdiction of state governments in the US and provincial governments in Canada. At a later stage, there was a federal involvement in wildlife primarily because of the Migratory Birds Convention Act of 1917. This was passed as a result of widespread concern at the disappearance or severe declines of many species of birds that were widely hunted. These included many species of shorebirds, including Eskimo Curlew Numenius borealis, Lesser Golden Plover Pluvialis dominica and both native species of Crane Grus canadensis and G. americana. Since these birds migrated through several states and provinces, it was decided they should be under federal jurisdiction. Initially the treaty was between the USA and Great Britain on behalf of Canada, and resulted in the establishment of a bureaucracy. The first Migratory Bird Officer in Canada, Hoyes Lloyd was hired in 1918 and attached to the agency responsible for Canada's National Parks. The Dominion Wildlife Service was established in 1947 as a separate entity with a staff of fewer than 30. In 1950 it became the Canadian Wildlife Service, and as such has played a leading role in ornithological research and management in Canada. In the USA there were similar developments with the establishment of what is now the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), although it has perhaps played a smaller role in research than its Canadian equivalent. Much more recently, Mexico, also a country with a federal system, became the third North American country to participate in the Act. Departments of Wildlife or, as they were more often called, Departments of Fish and Game exist in most states and provinces and exert much influence in the management of species of birds, mainly non-migratory but until recently concentrating almost exclusively on game species and predators (hawks and owls). Whereas in Europe, game management is mainly the prerogative of private landowners, in North America it is the subject of intensive government activity. Birds in Canada are the property of the Crown and thus belong to the people of Canada. All 'migratory' birds as defined by the Migratory Bird Convention are federal responsibility. The so-called vermin -such as crows, blackbirds (i.e. Icteridae), cormorants Phalacrocorax sp., hawks and eagles -were left to the provinces and are legislated under Provincial acts. In the second half of the 20th century and often with federal funding, many states in the USA created Cooperative Wildlife Units, attached to state universities, which were designed to provide an academic link with the training and research needs of game management. In Canada, a similar link was made only in the 1990s when the research needs of government agencies such as the Canadian Wildlife Service had broadened to include habitat management, endangered species and biodiversity. The Chair of Wildlife Ecology (CWE) at Simon Fraser University, British Columbia was the first established in 1993, closely followed by ACWERN (Atlantic Cooperative Wildlife Ecology Research Network) in 1994. A journal that attracts many ornithologists studying topics with a management emphasis is the Journal of Wildlife Management (JWM) founded in 1936. It and its later off-shoot Wildlife Monographs, produced by the Wildlife Society, is dedicated mainly to issues of birds of economic or conservation importance. The two major formative trends in North American ornithology described above, which for convenience I will refer to as academic-focussed and management-focussed, have a long history and have persisted to some extent to the present day. It would be a mistake to consider them as in any sense antagonistic to one another. Rather they have complemented each another and with time the boundaries have become less and less distinct. Nevertheless they help to explain why, in North America, most studies involving waterfowl and game species relate to applied and practical questions, whereas more theoretical topics are more likely to involve other taxonomic groups. The long-term study of the population biology of Lesser Snow Geese Anser caerulescens, initiated in 1968 and still continuing (Cooke et al. 1995) seemed arcanely theoretical to many wildlife biologists in North America and misguided in its choice of study organism to many classical ornithologists. Nevertheless, although the original intention of studying the species was to understand the basis and consequences of the plumage polymorphism in this species, data from this work formed the basis for decisions on one of the most widespread recent debates on bird management in North America, namely whether or not to attempt to drastically reduce the Snow Goose population through hunting. Much more typical of North American ornithology were, from the academic tradition, the classic long-term studies of the Florida Scrub Jay Aphelocoma coerulescens by Glen Woolfenden and associates (Woolfenden & Fitzpatrick 1984), and from the management tradition, the series of monographs on the population characteristics of the Mallard Anas platyrhynchos by David Anderson and associates (e.g. Anderson & Henny 1972, Anderson & Burnham 1976. The two trends in ornithology had other contrasting characteristics. The management-focussed research tended to be short-term, better funded and more localized in its application. It was also more likely to be published in government reports than in the peerreviewed literature and be less available to a wider audience. On the other hand, it had a greater impact on policy and management and as a consequence waterfowl and game bird research had the potential for influencing natural habitats and conservation programmes. Many of these programmes led to policies such as the establishment of National Wildlife Areas, whose major objective was the management and conservation of hunted species, but which nevertheless had beneficial effects on birds in general. Academicfocussed ornithology, based in museums and university biology departments, was probably less influential on government planning but through connections with amateur ornithologists contributed to the rise of environmental awareness and the increasing realization that birds of all kinds were a key to healthy environments. With this realization, new scientific journals such as Conservation Biology and Biological Conservation have emerged, many of whose papers deal with bird-related topics."}, {"section_title": "The last 50 years", "text": "In this section I explore two main questions. First, how has the focus of ornithological research changed from the 1950s to the present? What branches of the discipline have increased or decreased and what were the key triggers for these changes? Second, how has ornithological research contributed to bird conservation on the continent? More specifically, since this is a huge topic, how have ornithologists contributed to the organization of bird research in a way that effectively enables us to conserve bird populations? In order to illustrate some of the trends in the last 50 years, I have examined the topics of research interest as illustrated by four North American journals with major or exclusive interest in birds, three coming from the academic-focussed tradition (Auk, Condor and Wilson Bulletin) and one from the managementfocussed tradition (Journal of Wildlife Management) for the analysis. I have used publications from 1952-54 for my early period sample and from 2001-03 for the recent data. The first comparison (Table 1) relates to the taxonomic groups studied in the two types of journal. In the Journal of Wildlife Management, 94% of 102 papers analysable according to species group studied related to waterfowl or gamebirds, only two dealt with raptors and four with other types of birds. A typical paper of the time is by Lyon (1954): 'Pheasant winter roosting cover preference in North-central Colorado'. The emphasis on species with an obviously practical benefit for hunting was overwhelming. From Auk, Condor and Wilson Bulletin, the opposite was true: 78% of the 210 papers sampled were on non-game species, 14% were on game species and 8% on raptors. A typical paper is by Skutch (1953): 'Life history of the Blue and White Swallow'. This distinction is probably even more pronounced than the figures reflect since the species in the latter sample of predators and game species often reflected species of little or no interest to the hunter. Averaging the samples from all the journals examined, 40% of the publications were studies of species of two bird taxa traditionally associated with hunting, Anseriformes and Galliformes. Undoubtedly if I had been able to sample all publications in ornithology during this time period, which would have included papers of more general scientific interest, the percentage would probably have been lower, but nevertheless it shows the important role that economically important species had in North American studies in the 1950s. From the present-day samples, the difference in emphasis between publications in the Journal of Wildlife Management and those in the others is much less obvious: 51% of the 110 Journal of Wildlife Management papers examined were concerned with game species, 8% with raptors (though not necessarily with their role as predators) and 41% with non-game birds. This dramatic change during the past 50 years from almost 95% to just over 50% reflects an increasing awareness of the importance of all birds as indicators of habitat change, of birds as a conspicuous element of biodiversity and as an interesting group of organisms in their own right. It also reflects the relative decline of hunting as part of the way of life as North American society became more affluent. A typical Journal of Wildlife Management paper at the present time might be that by Fletcher & Koford (2002) 'Habitat and landscape associations of breeding birds in native and restored grasslands'. By contrast there was little switch in the species studied in Auk, Condor and Wilson Bulletin: 83% of 264 papers sampled were unrelated to gamebirds and predators, 7% had game species as the study organism and 10% concerned raptors. Overall, the proportion of papers using gamebird species as their main focus has now dropped to 27%, a drop of 13% in 50 years, most of this drop due to change of emphasis in Journal of Wildlife Management papers. This no doubt partly reflects government responsiveness to changing conservation priorities. It probably also reflects a gradual realization that practical questions may be solved more effectively using facts learned and ideas explored in other, less 'useful' species. This shift occurred in parallel with the emergence of ecologically trained biologists in government posts."}, {"section_title": "Research topics", "text": "The second comparison relates to the aspects of avian biology covered by the papers. In collaboration with Colin Bibby, I chose to classify papers according to the following broad categories: population dynamics, population surveys, general ecology, behaviour, movement and migration, methods, classification and taxonomy, physiology, disease and pesticides, anatomy and morphology. They were chosen to make comparisons of the importance of the topics in North America relative to Europe (see Bibby 2003). Some papers naturally covered more than one category. In the sample of 50 years ago, 47% of the papers in the Journal of Wildlife Management had a broadly ecological focus, with food studies and population dynamics being the most frequent. Then, 29% was concerned with methods of studying wildlife, such as trapping techniques and statistical sampling techniques. Physiology, pathology and pesticides were the topic of 18%, whereas taxonomy, genetics, morphology, migration and behaviour each comprised less than 7% of the papers. Population surveys and topics pertaining to population change were surprisingly infrequent, occurring in only 7% of the publications, and some of these discussed survey methods rather than the results of the surveys. In the 1950s, Auk, Condor and Wilson Bulletin had a more even spread of subdisciplines. Then 31% had a broadly ecological focus, two-thirds of which dealt with population dynamics. Some were little more than accounts of some aspect of the breeding biology of the species, and would now be classified as natural history. A further 17% of the papers dealt with behaviour, considerably more than in the Journal of Wildlife Management. Taxonomy, nomenclature and systematics were also more heavily represented (14%), and a surprising number dealt with distribution (16%). Anatomy and morphology accounted for 10%. A typical paper of the age might be Bailey (1953) 'The incubation patch of passerine birds'. As with the Journal of Wildlife Management, population surveys were rarely of interest, with only 4% of the papers relating to this topic. Evolution was seldom the subject of publica-tions, and questions were seldom posed in an evolutionary framework. Although Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection had been published almost a century earlier, the implications of Darwin's ideas for ornithology and many other branches of biology were only beginning to be appreciated. There were subtle differences in emphasis between the two groups of journal. Papers dealing with population dynamics usually emphasized survival in the Journal of Wildlife Management whereas in Auk, Condor and Wilson Bulletin fecundity studies predominated. Fifty years later in the Journal of Wildlife Management, there was an increasing emphasis on ecology (68%), mainly at the expense of methodological (11%) and physiological (7%) papers. Surprisingly, given the fact that long-term survey data now existed, there was actually a reduction in publications on the topic of population surveys (4%), relative to the earlier period. In Auk, Condor and Wilson Bulletin there was also a considerable increase in ecological topics (52%), mainly at the expense of taxonomy, morphology and distributional studies. Surprisingly there was no real increase in behavioural papers, although there was an increased emphasis on behaviour in ecologically based papers. There was an increased interest in physiology and in migration and movement. In both the early and late samples there was comparatively little emphasis on population surveys (4% and 5% respectively). Despite the accumulation of many long-term data sets and the increasing concern over declines in bird populations, the publication of scientific work pertaining to population changes is still relatively rare in North America. In both groups of journals and in contrast to the earlier samples, the central paradigms of evolutionary theory are now well understood. Most of the papers start with an evolutionary question. Another difference is that most papers combine two or more of the categories used for my initial classification. Papers drawing on several different aspects of ornithology, such as ecomorphology or behavioural systematics were the norm. A representative paper is Dunn (2002) 'A cross Canada comparison of mass change in birds during migration stop-over'."}, {"section_title": "Study and author locations", "text": "An obvious change in the past 50 years is reflected in the location of the studies (Table 2). Only three of the 237 studies (1%) examined in the early Journal of Wildlife Management issues were related to work carried out outside North America, whereas 50 years later the figure had risen to 20 out of 252 (8%), still a surprisingly small proportion. By contrast in Auk, Condor and Wilson Bulletin during the 1950s, there were 53 studies out of 220 (24%) carried out away from the USA or Canada, although only seven (3%) of these were by authors from outside the region. Most of the studies away from the USA or Canada were within the western hemisphere, with only 14 from other parts of the world. Amongst the present-day sample, the proportion has risen from 24% to 39% (102 out of 262). These were equally divided between the western hemisphere and the rest of the world. The increase in the proportion of non-US and Canadian authors is much more pronounced, from 3% to 28%. The world of ornithology has become much more cosmopolitan, but less so in the management-based branch of the discipline. Perhaps this reflects the more localized nature of management issues and funding."}, {"section_title": "North American-UK comparisons", "text": "One of the interesting differences in emphasis in subject matter between North America and the UK, at least as expressed through an examination of Bird Study, is the paucity of North American publications dealing with population survey data. In the 50 years of Bird Study, 25-40% of the papers were concerned with this topic compared with 5% for the North American journals. There are a number of explanations for this. First, Bird Study itself is not typical of UK bird journals insofar as it is published by the BTO whose major mandate is bird population studies. Secondly, bird populations are less well studied, for reasons presented below. Thirdly, there seems to be some underlying prejudice in the ornithological community of North America that survey and population trend papers represent a less rigorous type of ornithology. Surveys were and still are to some extent thought of as activities of government agencies and consulting companies, 2003 British Trust for Ornithology, Bird Study, 50, 211-222  and they tend to appear in the 'grey' literature. As a result there is no regularly produced journal in North America equivalent to Bird Study which focuses on bird population questions, although in recent years the Journal of Field Ornithology has moved in this direction. In my opinion there is an unoccupied niche that could be filled by such a journal."}, {"section_title": "Birds and conservation", "text": "As scientific ornithology increased in North America, it was inevitable that more thought would be given to the conservation of birds and their habitats. In the following section, I compare North American approaches to bird conservation with those carried out by organizations such as the BTO whose pioneering work in the UK has set an admirable standard for the world. In my lifetime, the public awareness of birds as an important element of the environment as a whole has increased enormously. In the 1950s, who would have thought that by the turn of the millennium, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) would have a larger membership than the combined membership of the Labour and Conservative Parties in UK? Who would have imagined that UK Government guidelines monitoring improvements in the quality of life would use a measure of changing numbers of farmland and woodland birds as part of their index? Much of the ornithological research allowing such an index to be used originates from the co-ordinated efforts of members of the BTO -a trust established in 1933. The strength of the BTO has depended on a strong bond between professional and amateur ornithologists. The latter are mainly recruited from the birdwatching community, who contribute time and data. Many of these have a strong commitment to bird conservation. These data, often analysed with the help of professionals, can be used to monitor trends in bird populations. By the use of integrated population monitoring (Greenwood et al. 1993), not only can changes (particularly declines) in bird populations be reliably demonstrated, but often the demographic causes of those declines can be elucidated, leading hopefully to conservation measures to counteract the causes of the declines (Greenwood 2003). In the USA and Canada, there have been a number of major long-standing initiatives designed to increase our quantitative knowledge of bird populations and their distribution. The first of these was started through the National Audubon Societies. Frank Chapman is credited with their introduction in 1900. Being aware that a common practise at the time was a hunt, where people shot as many birds as possible during the Christmas period, he decided instead that he would recommend to his friends and colleagues an annual Christmas bird count where individuals would spend one day counting all the birds they could find within a circle of 15 miles diameter of some self-selected location. The first count resulted in 27 people taking part in 25 counts from Toronto, Canada in the north to Pacific Grove, California in the south, and yielded a total of 18 500 individual birds. Since that time Christmas bird counts have been an annual tradition, and although often statistically difficult to interpret have nevertheless provided a longterm data set, widely used for analysing population and distributional trends (e.g. Root 1988). The results were published in Bird Lore, the official publication of the Audubon Societies, and in its later reincarnations as Audubon Field Notes, American Birds and National Audubon Field Notes. Many professional ornithologists are still reluctant to place too much reliance on the data generated by Christmas bird counts because of their lack of quality control, their slightly competitive basis, lack of randomness of the locations and focus on species tallies rather than counting. They are still individually carried out mainly by amateurs, but are currently co-ordinated in the USA through the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology (CLO), which organizes several of the bird surveys in the USA. In Canada they are co-ordinated by Bird Studies Canada (BSC). Both the CLO and BSC model themselves to some extent on the BTO. Other major initiatives involving amateur/professional collaboration were initiated by government agencies. The first of these, developed in 1937 by the US Bureau of Biological Survey, was the Breeding Bird Census, designed to monitor nesting species of North America. Areas of various sizes were chosen by interested amateurs or professionals and all the breeding birds within the area were counted. The results were also published in Bird Lore and its successors. Both these approaches had one very serious drawback -the areas surveyed were chosen by the participants themselves and, as with the Common Bird Census run for several years by BTO (Bibby 2003), they are concentrated in areas where birdwatchers frequent and are often chosen for their attractiveness to birds. To counter this criticism and to establish a continent-wide bird monitoring procedure, Chandler Robbins of the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in collaboration with officials of the Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS) set up the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) in 1966. Note that, in contrast to the UK, the initiative came from government, albeit with a dedicated birdwatcher and ornithologist at its head. This survey consists of road surveys of 25 miles in length, and chosen randomly from the road networks of the continent. Each survey is carried out by car with a fixed starting time (relative to dawn) during the early part of summer, and comprises 50 two-minute stops at intervals of 0.5 miles where all birds seen and heard are counted at each stopping location. As in the UK, most of these surveys are carried out by dedicated amateur birdwatchers. One major drawback of the North American BBS is its emphasis on birds nesting in settled parts of North America, but despite this, population trends for most of the commoner North American breeding species can be assessed through appropriate statistical techniques. These analyses are mainly conducted by a team of statisticians from the Bird Banding Laboratory at Patuxent, Maryland, formerly a branch of the USFWS, but because of bureaucratic and political changes is now bizarrely a branch of the US Geological Survey, another US federal agency. These data form a strong part of the ornithological information used to assess population trends. In turn these data are utilized by non-governmental organizations and government agencies for conservation work. There are now several methods available for monitoring bird populations in North America, as described above. The origins and effectiveness of such monitoring are very different from those in UK. In a few cases, knowledge of population sizes and distributions is greater, such as in many waterfowl and game species, but for most North American birds there is much less information on population trends and demographic processes. There are five reasons for this. First, because of the long-standing governmental involvement in managing birds, federal, state and provincial agencies exist with a mandate to understand and manage bird populations. Historically this management concentrated overwhelmingly on waterfowl and gamebirds, but during the past 20 years the attention has increasingly included non-hunted species. Non-gamebird biologists are on the staff of many of these agencies. Secondly, much of the land in North America in contrast to Europe is under government ownership. While this in no way ensures the conservation of bird populations, at least there is the possibility of public input to the management of these lands. Thirdly, there is less of a tradition of collaboration between amateurs and professionals. This partly reflects the different history of the two continents and partly the fact the there are a much larger ratio of professional to amateur ornithologists in North America compared with the UK. Fourthly, the geography of North America with more decentralized government and greater distances between settlements has resulted in fewer national efforts and more regional and local ones. Fifthly, human population densities are much lower than in Europe and vast areas of prime avian breeding habitat, home to many species of birds, are out of normal reach of ornithologists. The Canadian boreal forest and arctic tundra regions are virtually free of human settlements and roads are absent, yet approximately 110 species of bird breed only in these habitats. Any attempt to estimate bird populations in these areas relies on indirect approaches, notably the Migration Monitoring Programme, which consists of a network of bird observatories across Canada, where regular and standardized bird ringing occurs throughout the spring and fall in order to assess populations and productivity of northern breeding birds that migrate through the region. Even in those parts of North America where human populations are greater, the tradition of birdwatching, more specifically by committed amateurs is not as well established as it is in the UK. Although many US states and Canadian provinces have produced Breeding Bird Atlases, often of extremely high quality, the level of coverage has inevitably been less intensive than in the UK and most parts of Europe. The Atlas of the Breeding Birds of Ontario (Cadman et al. 1987), for example, covered the whole of southern and settled parts of the province in units of 10-km squares, but in northern Ontario where road access was in most cases impossible, 100-km square units were used instead with volunteers often flying into remote lakes using float planes. Canada has the second largest land mass of any country in the world yet its population is small and this results in a relatively small group of ornithologists. In order to have maximal impact for bird conservation, therefore, it is important that ornithologists work effectively together in order to be able to understand their bird populations and factors involved in their conservation. Scientific ornithology in Canada has three main components. The first is represented by governmentemployed scientists. The Canadian Wildlife Service, established in 1947 is a division of the federal govern-ment's Environment Canada, which now administers the Migratory Birds Protection Act, the Species at Risk Act, Canada Wildlife Act and other legislation relevant to federally defined 'migratory birds'. It has several research scientists, studying habitat and population issues in all regions of Canada. It also has a larger group of biologists who are also involved in bird conservation and management. Some of the larger provinces, such as Ontario, also employ provincial government research scientists. The second component is the academic community and the museums. As in most parts of the world, museum ornithologists are becoming an endangered species. Taxonomy and systematics are not favoured by granting agencies, and despite the importance of novel molecular ways of investigating evolutionary relationships, most museums and universities find it difficult to cover these fields adequately. Many Canadian universities do, however, have resident ornithologists and they, along with the government scientists, represent the major component of the membership of the Society of Canadian Ornithologists (SCO), the organization most associated with the professional and academic element of ornithology in Canada. As in the UK, many scientists working with birds are likely to classify themselves according to the subject of their study (ecologists, ethologists, physiologists) rather than as ornithologists. Although many of this group currently carry out research with a conservation emphasis, it is seldom the major focus of the group. The third component is the body of dedicated amateurs, who in the UK would probably become members of the BTO. Because of the huge distances between major cities and communities, most of these would become members of local birding or natural history societies. In a continent with such distances between communities, national organizations are more difficult to create and maintain. St John's Newfoundland is further from Vancouver than it is from London. Thus it is not surprising that the first attempt in Canada to create an organization dedicated to the study and conservation of bird populations in Canada had initially a much more local focus. This was the Long Point Bird Observatory (LPBO), founded in 1960 initially as a committee of the Ontario Bird-banding Association (OBBA) mainly for the study of bird migration through ringing (banding) of the huge numbers of migrants that passed through southern Ontario each spring and fall. In the early 1980s, due largely to the vision of David Hussell and Erica Dunn, the focus of interest expanded to include a variety of other bird-monitoring programmes such as the Canadian Lakes Loon Surveys and Project Feeder Watch, the latter a parallel to the BTO Garden Bird Watch. Initially most of the participants in these programmes were from Ontario, but in the early 1990s the vision became nation-wide and LPBO expanded to become Bird Studies Canada (BSC). Modelled broadly on the BTO, BSC now has a large number of bird-monitoring programmes, a professional staff of ornithologists and regional offices in most regions of Canada, in addition to a dedicated band of amateur ornithologists. The Migration Monitoring Programme, mentioned above, is co-ordinated by BSC. Other programmes include habitat-specific ones such as the Marsh Monitoring Programme and the Coastal Waterbirds Surveys and species-specific ones such as the Owl Monitoring Survey. As with the BTO, a major role of BSC is the collection of high quality data on bird population trends, collected mainly by amateurs and analysed by professionals. But how are the data used? Recall that, historically in North America, this was a function of government agencies. BSC has been effective in working closely with CWS at a time when there has been a decline in the ability of government agencies to monitor and manage bird populations. As government resources decline and as the number of conservation issues increase, the Canadian taxpayer is unwilling or unable to pay civil servants to monitor and manage bird populations. There also is a political climate that encourages partnerships, such as that between CWS and BSC. As a consequence, unpaid amateurs have tried to fill the niche. As the British rely heavily on the RSPB to wage the political campaigns for bird conservation, largely using information supplied by the BTO, the Canadian Nature Federation (CNF) and several provincial naturalist federations play similar roles in Canada. Both BSC and CNF represent Canada on BirdLife International. Although I have concentrated on the Canadian ornithological scene, there are institutions in the USA parallel to those described above. The National Audubon Society is active both in bird population monitoring and bird conservation. At least three institutions, the Point Reyes Bird Observatory (PRBO), Manomet Bird Observatory and the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology (CLO) have taken on national roles in the USA analogous to BSC in Canada. They too are dedicated to involving amateurs in bird population monitoring in various forms and in making the results available for conservation initiatives. At the opening of this article, I stressed the importance of ornithology at a continental rather than a national level. This is more self-evident in a continent where for most ornithologists a large proportion of the birds are migratory, than it is in the UK, where many non-migratory species occur and where insular thinking has a long history. Although there are many European examples of international collaboration, often with BTO playing a significant role, these are probably in general more recent than those in North America. The earliest North American Christmas Bird Counts had participants from Canada and the USA, and now there are counts throughout Central and North America. The AOU has always considered itself a North American rather than a US organization and its current president and secretary are both Canadians. Bird conservation in the New World has also to be tackled at a hemispheric level and there are currently a number of exciting initiatives taking place between Mexico, USA and Canada, and I will end with an example of some of these. North America has a long history of international collaboration in the field of waterfowl management. The flyway system was developed to provide an equitable 'harvest' of ducks and geese for hunters in all the states and provinces through which the birds passed on their annual fall migration. For example, Snow Geese that nest in the mid-Canadian Arctic pass through Manitoba, North and South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska and Arkansas on their way to the wintering grounds in Texas, Louisiana and northeast Mexico. If hunters from each state and province were to kill as many geese as they wanted, regardless of the kill in other states then it is easy to see that over-hunting and potential extirpation could occur. Only by agreement on the 'bag' limits among the political jurisdictions can there be effective management of the populations. This collaboration, spurred by reported drops in waterfowl numbers, led to the realization that it was possible to set population objectives for the various waterfowl species. If a population was declining, it might be possible to increase the population through reduction of the bag limit or even an outright ban on hunting. Similarly, if a population was increasing it might be possible to kill more birds without jeopardizing the population. This then led to the concept that for management to be effective, one should define population goals for each species, and manage the species according to those goals. The result of this approach was the birth of the North American Waterfowl Management Plan in 1985 with the non-euphonious acronym NAWMP, usually pronounced 'Narwump'. NAWMP was no less than a continental plan for bird conservation within a particular group of birds. Of course it was driven by an interest in exploiting the species and it stemmed from the management-focused ornithology referred to earlier, but nevertheless it provided a vision for bird conservation beyond anything previously envisioned. Moreover, through partnerships between government agencies and non-governmental organizations it provided a mechanism for maintaining these populations. If a population problem is identified through the monitoring process, priorities can be established, solutions can be sought and put in place and resources found through a combination of government and private agencies. This large-scale planning is more prevalent in North American ornithology than it is in Europe, where bird conservation is more often left to individual organisations such as the RSPB and the World Wildlife Fund, and this again reflects the governmental involvement which has been present since early settlement of North America by Europeans. The NAWMP concept took a further step in the 1990s with the expansion to migratory land birds and then through several initially separate initiatives to all groups of birds. Partners in Flight (PIF) was established in 1990 under the rallying cry of 'keep common birds common' (Fitzpatrick 2002). Other public/private partnerships included the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network (WHSRN) whose concept stretched to include wader conservation throughout North, Central and South America, the North American Colonial Waterbird plan, focussing mainly on Ardeidae and Laridae and the Important Bird Area (IBA) programme which was initially developed in Europe through the ICBP (later BirdLife International) but which was adopted in Canada and the USA through the Commission on Environmental Cooperation (CEC), an environmental arm of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), North America's equivalent to the European Union (EU) and with similar legislative powers. Finally these various semi-independent initiatives came together in 1998 when the North American Bird Conservation Initiative (NABCI) was launched, again with financial backing and organizational support from CEC. This ambitious plan was no less than a management plan for all North American bird species, and involved federal governments of Mexico, USA and Canada, provincial and state governments and an array of non-governmental organizations such as Ducks 2003 British Trust for Ornithology, Bird Study, 50, 211-222 Unlimited, National Audubon Society, Bird Studies Canada, Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology and many more. An initial organizational meeting took place in Puebla, Mexico in November 1998 involving representatives of all these groups, and ideas for objectives and organization were discussed. NABCI is still in its infancy, and has yet to prove itself. It may become a bureaucratic nightmare or it might provide the framework for bird conservation throughout North America and beyond. It is too early to say, but the signs are promising. Federal governments have made substantial commitments of funds and the initiative has already led to a dramatic increase in awareness of bird conservation. NABCI gives an obvious rationale for bird population monitoring. It provides a possible tool for effecting the management needed to halt bird population declines and a mechanism for prioritizing the conservation needs. It is not designed to replace existing bird conservation initiatives but provides a broader spectrum by which they may be judged. There is an obvious role for scientific ornithology, although whether the scientists will respond or whether the bureaucrats will dominate is still uncertain. In conclusion, there are many differences between the organization of ornithology in Europe and North America, reflecting the very different histories of the two continents. Each has much to learn from the other. Only in the UK could an organization like the BTO have arisen. Its careful approach to population monitoring through an army of amateur naturalists working in collaboration with professionals is unique and vital to ornithology and bird conservation. It has provided a model for North American organizations such as BSC and CLO. At the same time, co-ordinated initiatives such as NAWMP and NABCI provide an example of governments working with ornithologists (a sort of public/private partnership?) which is much rarer in the UK and the rest of Europe than it is in North America.
