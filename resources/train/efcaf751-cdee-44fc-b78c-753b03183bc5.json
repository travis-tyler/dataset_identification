[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Mitochondrial function in human skeletal muscle declines with age. Most evidence for this decline comes from studies that assessed mitochondrial function indirectly, and the impact of such deterioration with respect to physical function has not been clearly delineated. We hypothesized that mitochondrial respiration in permeabilized human muscle fibers declines with age and correlates with phosphocreatine postexercise recovery rate (kPCr), muscle performance, and aerobic fitness. Mitochondrial respiration was assessed by high-resolution respirometry in saponin-permeabilized fibers from vastus lateralis muscle biopsies of 38 participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA; 21 men, age 24-91 years) who also had available measures of peak oxygen consumption (VO 2max ) from treadmill tests, gait speed in different tasks, 31 P magnetic resonance spectroscopy, isokinetic knee extension, and grip strength. Results indicated a significant reduction in mitochondrial respiration with age (p < .05) that was independent of other potential confounders. Mitochondrial respiratory capacity was also associated with VO 2max , muscle strength, kPCr, and time to complete a 400-m walk (p < .05). A negative trend toward significance (p = .074) was observed between mitochondrial respiration and BMI. Finally, transcriptional profiling revealed a reduced mRNA expression of mitochondrial gene networks with aging (p < .05). Overall, our findings reinforce the notion that mitochondrial function declines with age and may contribute to age-associated loss of muscle performance and cardiorespiratory fitness."}, {"section_title": "| INTRODUCTION", "text": "Mitochondrial function declines with age across multiple tissues, especially those with high energy demand such as skeletal muscle, brain, and heart (Gonz alez- Freire et al., 2015; Newgard & Pessin, 2014; Peterson, Johannsen & Ravussin, 2012) . This functional decline is associated with substantial reduction in various biochemical properties including respiratory capacity, ATP production, and calcium handling capacity and content, as well as increased apoptosis (Gonz alez-Freire et al., 2015) . Part of the age-related decline of mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle is due to a reduction in physical activity and can be rescued by exercise (Broskey et al., 2014; Kent and Fitzgerald, 2016; Larsen et al., 2012; Menshikova et al., 2006) . However, physical fitness, which is strongly connected with mitochondrial respiration, declines with aging even in individuals who remain physically active (Distefano et al., 2017; Robinson et al., 2017) . Therefore, the mechanisms and the extent by which chronological age \"per se\" affects the mitochondrial energy production remain unclear.\nIn previous studies, we assessed muscle mitochondrial function in a relatively large group of participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) using 31 P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and showed that muscle bioenergetics, assessed as postexercise phosphocreatine recovery rate (kPCr), declines with aging and correlates with poorer performance in mobility tasks, especially those performed at fast pace or on long distances (Choi et al., 2016) . Consistent with this study and using the same in vivo measurements, Zane et al. (2017) demonstrated that muscle strength significantly mediates the relationship of mitochondrial function with walking performance. However, studies that assessed mitochondrial electron transport chain respiration \"ex vivo\" by performing assays in permeabilized muscle fibers yielded controversial results concerning the effect of aging as well as correlations with physical capacity tests Coen et al., 2013; Distefano et al., 2017; Tyrrell et al., 2015) . This discordance in the literature may be related to inherent methodological differences.\n31 P MRS assesses mitochondrial capacity to generate ATP following muscle contraction in vivo and integrates all aspects of mitochondrial content and function including oxygen consumption, efficiency, and Ca 2+ handling, which together contribute to produce ATP. 31 P MRS may be sensitive to factors external to mitochondria such as adequate perfusion and oxygen delivery during and after exercise, changes in intracellular pH and other characteristics of the microenvironment. Therefore, it is unclear whether the decline in oxidative capacity observed in our previous studies is a direct consequence of an intrinsic impairment in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) with aging. Ex vivo respiration assays in permeabilized muscle fibers may address this problem as they specifically assess ETC function and are conducted in highly controlled conditions including saturating levels of oxygen and substrates.\nTo explore whether aging is associated with a primary intrinsic dysfunction of mitochondrial ETC respiratory capacity, we performed ex vivo mitochondrial respiration in permeabilized fibers from vastus lateralis muscle biopsies obtained from 38 BLSA participants who also had data available on treadmill peak oxygen consumption (VO 2max 2 | RESULTS"}, {"section_title": "| Participant characteristics", "text": "The main characteristics of the study population, including demographics, physiological, and mitochondrial respiration parameters, are summarized in Table 1 and Table S1 ."}, {"section_title": "| Mitochondrial respiration and its association with aging and body composition", "text": "Mitochondrial respiration was carried out with permeabilized muscle fiber bundles from 38 participants using the Oxygraph-2k. The correlations and partial correlations between the different mitochondrial respiration measurements and age are summarized in (Figure 2 ). Results were similar when calculating AUC of the entire titration curve from every participant using the trapezoidal formula (see method section). The AUC represents total mitochondrial oxygen consumption over time, for example, the ability to the mitochondria to produce ATP. A statistically significant negative association existed between mitochondrial oxygen consumption and aging that was independent of sex or BMI (r = \u00c0.381, p = .018). Table S4 . A list of all GO Terms in the two pairwise comparisons is presented in Table S5 ."}, {"section_title": "| DISCUSSION", "text": "In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the intrinsic capacity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain declines with aging. Furthermore, we attempted to link such decline with clinically important measurements of muscle and physical function. Indeed, we found that, independent of sex and BMI, the capacity of the muscle mitochondria to produce energy is significantly lower at older ages.\nThese results are consistent with an age-associated decline of \"in vivo\" energetic capacity observed previously in BLSA participants (Choi et al., 2016; Zane et al., 2017) . Specifically, we found that at incremental concentrations of ADP, the ability of the mitochondria to produce ATP was diminished in older adults (Figure 2 ), suggesting that with age mitochondria might lose ability to step up energy production when maximal performance is required, but show relatively normal function when the energetic demand is lower. Such a decline of energy efficiency at a high portion of the energy demand spectrum was previously hypothesized and is consistent with the results of this study, although the molecular mechanisms that explain this observation remain unknown (Porter et al., 2015) . Further, we did not find any changes with age in the number of mitochondria (Figure S4) ; therefore, we believe that the reduction in mitochondrial respiration with age could be due to reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation efficiency rather than a reduction in mitochondrial number. Although controversial, these mechanisms have been proposed to explain the inability of old mitochondria to step up energy production while showing relatively normal function when the energetic demand is lower. These findings have been already observed in small series of muscle biopsies and may explain the inconsistencies across studies (Coen et al., 2013; Distefano et al., 2017; Tyrrell et al., 2015) . We note that the observation of lower energetic capacity at the highest levels of demand is more consistent with intrinsic defect in oxidative phosphorylation when challenged above a certain threshold. For example, studies in mice have found that skeletal muscle mitochondria are organized in a highly reticular structure around the myofibrils (Glancy et al., 2015; Patel, Glancy & Balaban, 2016; Porter et al., 2015) . Glancy et al. (2014) have hypothesized that this structure is essential to ensure that mitochondrial function is preserved at the center of the muscle fiber in condition of high energetic demand. A loss of integrity and connectivity of the mitochondrial network would lead to the observed age-related decline of energetic efficiency and adaptability to challenging conditions. vidual, and therefore, the aging effect could be hidden by the heterogeneity of fitness across age in the studied sample. Thus, we believe that some of the age-related changes in mitochondrial function might be likely the result of changes in behavior, such as reduced physical activity, and might be muscle type dependent, as it is known that aging affect or modify the movement patterns, and therefore, the different muscles may be affected differently. Previous studies have shown that the tibialis anterior is one of the muscles that is more affected by changes in the gait pattern during aging (Kent and Fitzgerald, 2016) .\nMitochondrial respiration was positively associated with muscle strength in both the upper and the lower extremities. In particular, the 5 ADP titration or Submaximal State 3 was the metric most highly correlated (grip strength: r = .360, p = .026; left knee extension isokinetic strength: r = .411, p = .010). However, this association was no longer statistically significant when the analysis was We did not find any association between mitochondrial respiration and gait speed, with or without adjustment for covariates.\nThese findings contrast with those reported by Tyrrell et al. (2015) who showed that mitochondria respiration parameters from isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria were associated with gait speed. Also, Choi et al. (2016) found that kPCr, a measurement in vivo of mitochondria function, is a predictor of gait speed in BLSA participants.\nAgain, our findings could be due to the heterogeneity of the effect in the analyzed samples. For example, it has been shown that the mitochondrial function is associated with walking performance in higher functioning active older adults, but not lower functioning sedentary adults (Santanasto et al., 2016) . Interestingly, we found a significant negative correlation of respiration in State 4, Submaximal\nState 3, and State 3 with the 400-m walk test, a proxy of mobility and fatigability. Similarly to the association between mitochondrial function and muscle strength, the Submaximal State 3 was the parameter most highly correlated with the time needed to complete the 400-m lap (r = \u00c0.435, p = .007). After adjustment by sex, age, and BMI, these associations were no longer statistically significant, possibly because of the limited sample size of this study.\nSimilarly to previous studies, we found a nonsignificant negative trend of mitochondrial respiration with BMI, suggesting that mitochondrial respiration might be negatively affected by adiposity or, alternatively, may contribute to increased adiposity Coen et al. 2015) . This trend supports the findings from Moore et al. (2014) that muscle quality declines progressively with age and is negatively affected by obesity. Other studies performed in a much larger population should further test the hypothesis that obesity is associated with muscle mitochondrial dysfunction.\nFurther supporting the idea of a decline in mitochondrial function with aging, we found an underrepresentation of mitochondrial gene expression in skeletal muscle of old BLSA participants. Specifically, pathways enriched in genes involved in mitochondrial respiratory chain and mitochondrial genome maintenance were among the most downregulated during aging. Previous studies have shown reduced expression of genes involved in energy metabolism and essential metabolic pathways as a result of aging, particularly in skeletal muscle (Reznick et al., 2007; Sandri et al., 2004; Su et al., 2015; Zabielski et al. 2016) . Notably, the age-related underrepresentation of the spliceosome pathway in the MA_Y and O_Y pairwise comparisons is of significance as this pathway has been recently found to be negatively impacted in the myonuclei proteome of old mice (Cutler et al., 2017) . Interestingly, the upregulation of pathways related with muscle structure and remodeling was also found in our study. Sarcopenia is a process whereby age- A noteworthy feature of this study is that measurements focused on several aspects of mitochondrial function were found to be significantly correlated. In Figure 4 , it is quite clear that all the measurements related to oxidative capacity are well-clustered together. Although our data should be replicated and confirmed in a larger population, we believe that our study strongly suggests that in the search for interventions to slow down muscle aging and to delay or prevent its negative physiological consequences, we should focus our efforts on those interventions that help to maintain or even enhance mitochondrial function in order to prevent its functional decline as we age.\nThe authors acknowledge the limitations of the study to assess mitochondrial function. However, the substrates and protocols used here (i.e., evaluating State 4 without using oligomycin) are commonly used in the published literature (Oroboros Oxygraph Bioblast: http:// wiki.oroboros.at)."}, {"section_title": "| EXPERIMEN TAL PROCED URES", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "| Participants", "text": "The Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (BLSA) is a study of human aging established in 1958 and currently supported by the National Institute on Aging (NIA).

Composition of buffer Z and BIOPS buffer was the same as previously described by Distefano et al. (2017) . The wet weight of the fiber bundles was measured for data normalization. The fiber bundles were placed into the chambers of the Oxygraph-2k (O2k, Oroboros Instruments, Innsbruck, Austria) after air calibration. A summary of the protocol is shown in Figure S1 .\nThe light in the chambers was turned off, and blebbistatin (Bleb), a myosin II ATPase inhibitor, capable of blocking spontaneous contraction of fiber bundles and mitigating the effects of contraction in respiratory kinetics (Perry et al., 2011) , was added to each chamber.\nAfter signal stabilization (~10-15 min), malate (5 mM), glutamate (10 mM), and succinate (10 mM) were added followed by the addition of 8 ADP titrations in increasing amounts (starting at 31.25 lM) until a final concentration of 2 mM, a concentration that we previously tested is saturating and elicits maximal State 3 respiration. Finally, cytochrome C (10 lM) was added at the end of the ADP titration curve to check the integrity of the outer mitochondrial membrane.\nThe fact that respiration did not increase by more than 15% indicated the lack of damage of the outer membrane.
