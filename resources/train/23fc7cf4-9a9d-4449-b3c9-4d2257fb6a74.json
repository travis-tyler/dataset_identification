Beyond APOE \u03b54, numerous singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have now been shown to be associated with small increases in AD dementia risk [16] . Based on a combination of APOE and 31 other genetic variants, we have developed and validated a 'polygenic hazard score' (PHS) for quantifying AD dementia age of onset [8] . Importantly, PHS was associated with in vivo biomarkers of AD pathology such as reduced CSF A\u03b2 and elevated CSF total tau across the AD spectrum (in older controls, MCI and AD dementia individuals). Further, using a large prospective clinical cohort, we have recently shown that PHS predicts time to AD dementia and longitudinal multi-domain cognitive decline in cognitively normal older (CN) individuals and in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [27] .\nHowever, the value of combining PHS with in vivo biomarkers of AD pathology to predict cognitive and clinical progression among nondemented MCI and CN older individuals remains unknown, and may improve the ability to identify nondemented individuals most at risk for short-term decline.

In these analyses, we controlled for age at baseline, sex, education, and APOE \u03b54 status (binarized as having at least one copy of the \u03b54 allele versus none). We further ascertained the 'enrichment' in amyloid and total tau positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for clinical progression to AD dementia, as a function of PHS percentiles. Next, we used linear mixed-effects (LME) models in CN and MCI individuals to investigate whether a statistical interaction between PHS and amyloid or total tau status significantly predicted longitudinal cognitive decline and clinical progression (mean follow-up time = 4.01 years, SD = 2.20 years, range = 0.24-10.26 years). We conducted LME models separately for amyloid and total tau. We defined cognitive decline using change scores in two domains, namely executive function and memory, based on composite scores developed using the ADNI neuropsychological battery and validated using confirmatory factor analysis [10] . We defined clinical progression using change scores in cognitive dementia rating sum of boxes (CDR-SB). We examined the main and interaction effects of PHS and biomarker positivity on cognitive decline and clinical progression rate, controlling for age, sex, education, APOE \u03b54 status, using the following LME model:\nHere, \u2206c = cognitive decline (executive function or memory) or clinical progression (CDR-SB) rate, \u2206t = change in time from baseline visit (years), biomarker_status = positive or negative for amyloid or total tau, and (1|subject) specifies the random intercept. We were specifically interested in PHS \u00d7 biomarker_status \u00d7 \u2206t, whereby a significant interaction indicates differences in rates of decline, as a function of differences in PHS and biomarker status. We then examined the simple main effects by comparing slopes of cognitive decline and clinical progression over time for individuals who were biomarker positive or negative, and with either high (~ 84 percentile) or low PHS (~ 16 percentile). We defined high and low PHS by 1 standard deviation above or below the mean of PHS, respectively [5] . To assess the added utility of PHS in predicting cognitive and clinical decline, we used likelihood ratio tests to compare the LME models with and without PHS.\nUsing a survival analysis framework, we next investigated the value of combining PHS with amyloid and total tau biomarker status to predict time to AD dementia progression. Specifically, we examined the effects of (1) PHS, (2) PHS in individuals who were amyloid positive, and (3) PHS in individuals who were amyloid and total tau positive, on time to AD dementia progression using a Cox proportional hazards model. We resolved 'ties' using the Breslow method. We covaried for sex, education, APOE \u03b54 status, age at baseline, and also age at baseline stratified into quintiles to adjust for violations of Cox proportional hazards assumptions by baseline age [27] . We restricted survival analyses, which involves AD dementia censoring, as well as the PPV/NPV analyses (see above) to the combined CN and MCI groups only as the CN individuals had low conversion rates during the observation period (< 5%).\nBuilding on our prior work [8] , we assessed whether amyloid and total tau status could inform PHS-predicted annualized incidence rate of AD dementia age of onset. We examined the influence of amyloid status, total tau status, and both in combination on the PHS-derived annualized incidence rate of AD dementia age of onset, based on previously established AD dementia incidence estimates from the United States population [4] .\nFinally, we evaluated the relationship between PHS and neuropathology (specifically, amyloid beta protein and tau-associated neuronal neurofibrillary tangles identified through molecularly specific immunohistochemistry and quantified by image analysis) in the community-based ROSMAP cohort using linear models, controlling for age at death and sex. Amyloid and tangle measures are mean of the square-root of the percentage area occupied by amyloid or tangles in eight brain regions, namely hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, midfrontal cortex, inferior temporal cortex, angular gyrus, calcarine cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and superior frontal cortex [1, 2] . We also assessed this relationship in APOE \u03b54 noncarriers. All statistical analyses were conducted using R version 3.4.2.

In APOE \u03b54 noncarriers, we also find similar results in combined MCI and CN cohorts, and in MCI individuals alone (Supplemental Results).\nIn addition, using likelihood ratio tests, we found that these full LME models resulted in a better fit than a reduced, non-PHS model with only amyloid status (executive function: \u03c7 ). Specifically, amyloid or total tau positive individuals with high PHS showed greater cognitive decline and faster clinical progression than individuals who were amyloid or total tau positive, irrespective of PHS (Fig. 4 ).

See Supplemental Figure 6 showing the distributions of PHS with amyloid and tangles for all individuals in the ROSMAP cohort. "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this study, we show that the predictive value of AD biomarkers of amyloidopathy and tauopathy increases systematically as a function of PHS among individuals without clinical dementia; for MCI and CN individuals in greater than the 50th percentile PHS, the positive predictive value for amyloid approached 100%. Even after controlling for APOE \u03b54, we found that PHS identified biomarker-positive nondemented older individuals at highest risk for AD dementia progression and longitudinal cognitive decline. Crucially, the combination of PHS, amyloid and total tau best predicted time to AD dementia progression and cognitive decline further indicating the value of stratifying by PHS, beyond amyloid or total tau alone. Furthermore, we found that amyloid and total tau positive individuals with high PHS will likely experience the highest annualized AD dementia incidence rates. In the community-based ROSMAP cohort, we found that higher PHS was associated with higher amyloid load and neuronal neurofibrillary tangles, even in APOE \u03b54 noncarriers. Collectively, our findings indicate that among nondemented older individuals, PHS can serve as an 'enrichment' marker for the presence of amyloid and tau deposition that is predictive of future progression to clinical dementia.\nFrom a clinical trial perspective, PHS may be useful in AD secondary prevention and therapeutic trials. Building on prior work [6, 28] , our PPV results indicate that PHS can be used to enrich clinical trial cohorts by identifying those nondemented individuals with amyloid or tau pathology who are at highest risk of progressing to AD dementia. Given that, progression to AD dementia among biomarker-positive nondemented individuals is slow, especially among clinically normal populations [21] , enriching for individuals at greatest risk of decline may improve the statistical power to detect treatment effects in prevention trials. As PHS strongly predicted both amyloid and total tau positivity, PHS may also serve as an initial screening tool for in vivo AD pathology; for cohort enrichment in trials, it may be helpful to pursue a stratified approach [7, 19] where costlier secondary assessments using CSF or PET biomarker assays are obtained only in those individuals with a high PHS. We note that the PPV was higher for amyloid compared to total tau indicating that PHS provides more enrichment in amyloid compared to tau pathology. However, this may in part be due to the disease stage examined in our analyses. Given that extensive tau deposition occurs in closer proximity to clinical symptoms [20] , we may have had limited power in detecting associations with tau given our focus on nondemented individuals. In contrast, we found that NPV was highest in individuals with low PHS percentiles, especially for total tau, indicating that individuals who tested negative for total tau and had low PHS were very unlikely to progress to AD dementia subsequently.\nFrom a clinical perspective, PHS likely represents a measurement of risk for AD dementia progression that is similar conceptually to other AD-associated risk factors that can influence an individual's age-specific annualized incidence rate. Thus, PHS may be useful for risk stratification of nondemented older individuals. In our linear mixed effects and survival analyses, we found that PHS considerably improved the ability of amyloid and total tau to predict time to AD dementia progression and longitudinal cognitive decline. Importantly, the combination of PHS, amyloid and total tau best predicted clinical and cognitive decline. Together, these findings highlight that a PHS-stratified approach may be clinically useful. Rather than evaluating all individuals, amyloid and tau assessments may be most helpful only in those individuals with a high PHS. Conversely, among individuals with a low PHS, it may be less effective to pursue additional evaluation with amyloid biomarkers.\nBuilding on prior work evaluating polygenic risk in preclinical AD [12, 18, 22] our findings indicate that PHS may be useful for predicting clinical and cognitive decline among asymptomatic older individuals. Among CNs, we found that significant interactions between PHS and amyloid or total tau predicted longitudinal change in CDR-SB. The general lack of a significant three-way interaction between PHS and amyloid/tau in predicting longitudinal change in executive function and memory in CNs may reflect the challenges involved in finding cognitive effects that may be suppressed by practice effects in serial cognitive testing for preclinical AD [11] . Furthermore, PHS predicted amyloid positivity even in CN individuals. Together, these results indicate that the utility of using PHS for cohort enrichment and screening may extend into preclinical AD. In other words, PHS can 6 Annualized cumulative incidence rates depicting instantaneous hazard based on an individual's age and polygenic hazard score (PHS), stratified based on individuals who were amyloid positive (red), amyloid negative (orange), total tau positive (blue), total tau negative (purple), and both amyloid and total tau positive (black) identify cognitively asymptomatic individuals who are more likely to show AD pathology and who may be at greatest risk for short-term clinical progression.\nAcross multiple lines of evidence, our results demonstrate that PHS provides independent information beyond AD pathological status. These results suggest that mechanistically, PHS may, in part, be capturing influence from other AD pathological pathways beyond amyloid and tau, a reflection of the complexity underlying AD pathogenesis involving neuroinflammation and immune regulation [3, 26] , neurovascular [30] , mitogenic and oxidative stress signaling pathways [29] . Alternatively, our findings may reflect that risk factors for pathology are not equivalent to pathology. That is, although strongly predictive of, PHS may not be a surrogate for amyloid or tau pathology.\nWithin both the biomarker (ADNI) and autopsy (ROS-MAP) datasets, although high PHS was predominantly associated with elevated pathology, we found individuals with low CSF/PET or post-mortem amyloid and tau, despite having high PHS (Supplemental Figures 1 and 6 ). These individuals highlight that genetic markers are not synonymous with pathologic markers, and suggest that non-genetic factors likely play an important role in modulating Alzheimer's neurodegeneration. Further, elucidating these lifestyle or environmental factors in individuals with elevated genetic risk may offer valuable insights into preventing and treating AD.\nIn conclusion, we show the utility of integrating PHS with in vivo biomarkers of amyloid and tau pathology for cohort enrichment in clinical trials and risk stratification for MCI and preclinical AD. Even after accounting for APOE \u03b54 effects, our findings indicate that stratification by PHS considerably 'boosts' the predictive value of amyloid. Among nondemented older individuals of European ancestry, the combination of both PHS and biomarker status best predicts cognitive and clinical decline. Future work should evaluate the value of PHS as an AD-associated risk stratification and cohort enrichment marker in diverse, non-Caucasian, non-European populations."}]
