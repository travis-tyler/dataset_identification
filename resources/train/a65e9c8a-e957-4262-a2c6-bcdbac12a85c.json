[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Iowa has led the U.S. in swine production and pig inventory since the 1880s. Pig production has been a reliable value-added enterprise on many Iowa farms for generations. In spite of this 120-year national leadership, Iowa's swine industry has been changing profoundly within the state. This article looks at the Iowa swine industry using U.S. Census of Agriculture data that was last taken in 2002 and USDA Hogs and Pigs Report data for 1997 and 1978, respectively. Other information sources were included at those dates or as close as possible.\nIowa agriculture from 1978 to 2002 endured many changes. During the 1980s, Iowa endured the Farm (debt) Crisis. In the 1990s industrialization of the swine industry became widespread in the U.S. and Iowa. In 1997 and 1998, hog prices plummeted to historic lows. In the face of all of these changes, Iowa has continued to lead the U.S. in pig production, but major changes in the industry's structure have caused remarkable shifts in the location of Iowa's pigs and the numbers of people involved in pig production. For example, in 25 years, the number of Iowa farms with pigs declined 83% from 59,134 farms in 1978 to 10,205 farms in 2002."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": "U.S. Census of Agriculture data and USDA Hogs and Pigs Report data were used to plot maps by county in Iowa and to compare the Iowa swine industry of 2002 to prior years. Additional information was added to help tell the story of change in the Iowa swine industry."}, {"section_title": "Results and Discussion", "text": "The national maps of pig inventories by state for 1997 and 2002 look quite similar (figures 1 and 2). Iowa continues to have the most pigs and North Carolina has the second most in the nation. In 2002, Iowa had about 15.5 million pigs; in 1997, 14.5 million pigs; in 1987, 13.0 million pigs; and in 1978, 14.7 One way to look at the data is to look at the total inventory of pigs per county. In 1978, there were two Iowa counties with less than 50,000 pigs. Twenty-five years later in 2002 there were 24 counties with less than 50,000 pigs. In 1978, there were no Iowa counties with more than 400,000 pigs but in 2002 there were nine Iowa counties with more than 400,000 pigs. Two of those counties -Hardin and Sioux -had more than 800,000 pigs. The pig inventory of Iowa has become increasingly concentrated into a few areas.\nWhen the data is presented as pigs per square mile or pig density, the shifts are even more pronounced. In 1987, the entire state of Iowa was still a relatively pig dense state ( Figure 6 ). In 2002, Iowa is a state with very high and also low pig densities (Figure 7 \u2022 The total number of pigs in Iowa has remained about the same. The total number of pigs has increased only 4.8% in Iowa in 25 years.\n\u2022 Interestingly, the number of pigs sold in Iowa has increased from 22.1 million in 1978 to 26.7 million in 2002. This is a 21% increase in the finishing phase of pig production in 25 years. The increase is a reflection of more feeder pigs imported into the state and more intensive management of pigs that results in rapid growth, fewer days to market, and more pigs produced per sow. Additionally, market hogs are 10% heavier (264 lbs per pig in 2001) than 25 years ago (240 lbs per pig in 1978). The finishing phase of pig production consumes the most feed, produces the most manure and is usually viewed as the least management intensive.\n\u2022 The average size of pig farms has dramatically increased 6 fold in 25 years. In 1978, the average Iowa pig farm had about 250 pigs. In 2002, the average Iowa pig farm had more than 1,500 pigs.\n\u2022 The number of pig farms has decreased by \u2022 Iowa's pig production culture has shifted to be more industrial and more mobile. Examples of mobility are feeder pigs from Canada, custom manure applicators, professional pig loading crews, and mobile swine managers that oversee thousands of pigs fed at multiple contract sites.\n\u2022 Risk has changed. In the past, many pig farmers had to deal with the risk of market swings. As more pigs are fed on contract, and the size of pig units increase, the risks facing Iowa farmers are often related to regulations, legal contracts, pig flow, and neighbors' perceptions.\n\u2022 A traditional proven entry path for beginning Iowa farmers -pig production -has greatly changed. Rather than independent entrepreneurs, many pig farmers are contract growers. Contract feeding of pigs may offer an alternative entry path for beginning Iowa farmers, but it has distinct characteristics.\n\u2022 A source of rural community leadership -pork producers -may be drying up. There are simply many fewer pig farmers in Iowa's rural areas. Pigs once viewed positively across Iowa may now be viewed negatively. Pigs in rural Iowa were once called \"mortgage lifters\" and pig manure odor was the \"smell of money.\" But in 2004, the ISU Rural Life Poll found th rural Iowa residents were asked their preferences about rural development activity, hog confinements ranked below prisons, solid waste landfills, slaughter plants, an treatment plant development. As pigs become concentrated in certain and vacate other areas of the state, the environmental impacts of pig production are more concentrated. Will statewide reg apply to all areas of Iowa equally? In the summer of 2005, the city zoo in Des Moines added two sows ready to farrow in a new agricultural display with ISU ag students to answer questions.
