Although the origin of the pools is unknown, it has been suggested that the supply of allochthonous mineral sediment from tidal waterways to the marsh platform may be a contributing factor. To investigate whether vertical accretion of Refuge marshland is limited by sediment accumulation, a study was conducted to measure rates of mineral sediment and organic matter accumulation (mass/area/time) and accretion (length/time) using 137 Cs and 210 Pb chronologies developed for 19 marsh sites throughout the Refuge. To establish patterns and rates of recent historical marsh loss, an analysis of historical aerial photographs was undertaken. Results indicate that Bombay Hook NWR has lost a total of ~8.6 million m 2 of marsh area since 1961. This loss was mostly caused by the formation of inland pools (~50% of area lost) and shoreface erosion along the Delaware Bay boundary (~35%), with a smaller contribution by waterway channel widening (~15%) Salt marsh accretion and mass accumulation rates measured for this study fall within the middle to upper range of similarly determined rates for undisturbed marshes of the Delaware Estuary, and rates based on 137 Cs and 210 Pb methods were largely in agreement. Accretion rates ( 137 Cs) for low marsh sites averaged 0.65 cm/yr and were significantly higher than rates at high marsh sites, which averaged 0.42 cm/yr. Combined mineral and organic mass accumulation rates ( 137 Cs) exhibited a similar difference between low and high marsh sites, averaging 0.31 g/cm 2 /yr and 0.13 g/cm 2 /yr, respectively. Mineral and organic mass accumulation rates correlated strongly with rates of accretion (R 2 = .85 and .79 respectively), revealing that both mineral sediment and organic matter drive marsh accretion at the Refuge, and that belowground biomass accumulation and aboveground mineral sediment deposition set the minimum and maximum rates of accretion, respectively. Marsh accretion rates measured in this study met or exceeded the rate of recent relative sea-level rise for the middle Delaware Estuary, based on the NOAA tide gauge record for Reedy Point (0.35 \u00b1 0.05 mm/yr, 1956Point (0.35 \u00b1 0.05 mm/yr, -2015. This result, in combination with the high rates of mineral accumulation measured throughout the Refuge, makes clear that there is not a marsh accretionary deficit related to insufficient mineral sediment. Moreover, the marsh soil record provides no evidence that the formation and expansion of marsh pools since the 1960s is related to low rates of marsh accretion or sediment supply. Additional research on historical changes in tidal inundation, marsh accretion, and elevation change is needed to better understand the nature of pool expansion and marsh loss at the Refuge."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Tidal wetlands of estuaries and deltas worldwide are threatened by a wide range of natural and anthropogenic influences ranging from accelerated sea level rise to changes in coastal land use (Coleman et al., 2008;Kirwan and Megonigal, 2013). Tidal wetlands provide important habitat for juvenile fish and seabirds, sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide, and protect coastal infrastructure from storms, thus loss of these ecosystem services has significant environmental and economic implications. Some projections on the survivability of tidal wetlands are bleak (Nicholls et al, 1999). For example, in the case of mid-latitude salt marshes, historical rates of wetland loss suggest near complete marsh loss in regions like the Chesapeake Bay (Reed et al., 2008). On the other hand, some authors paint a more optimistic picture, suggesting that ecosystem-scale feedback mechanisms have potential to provide sufficient defense against accelerated sea-level rise provided there is sufficient sediment availability for marsh accretion (Stralberg et al.,2011;Schuerch et al., 2013;Kirwan et al., 2016). Salt marshes can be divided into two types, estuarine and coastal, based on their geomorphic setting and soil properties (Darmody and Foss, 1979). Estuarine marsh soils are often very minerogenic, by reason of their proximity to fluvial sediment input, erosion within the estuary and marine sources. Consequently, estuarine marshes exhibit higher rates of sediment accumulation and accretion than coastal marshes (Boyd et al., 2017) and may be less prone to inundation by accelerating relative sea-level rise. Since the last glaciation much of the U.S. Atlantic Coast has been undergoing marine transgression caused by global sea level rise and regional land subsidence. In estuaries, transgression is characterized by landward and upward migration of the shoreline in advance of an eroding shoreface (Dalrymple et al., 1992). As the estuary widens and the tidal prism increases, the head of tides and saltwater intrusion migrate progressively landward. Shoreface erosion by wind-waves and tidal currents destroys tidal wetlands along transgressive coasts, whereas new wetlands are gained by landward migration of wetland plants into higher-elevation lowlands. Although wetland loss is a natural outcome of the lifecycle of estuaries and deltas (e.g., Wells and Coleman, 1987), the processes and patterns of loss are complex and difficult to predict. Superimposed on natural processes of wetland loss are anthropogenic factors including conversion of marshland to upland and hydrologic alteration (Gedan et al., 2009). This superposition of natural and human-driven change greatly complicates wetland management and restoration strategies. In this study, Bombay Hook National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) is presented as a case study of a human-altered tidal wetland complex on a rapidly transgressing estuarine coast. The Refuge is located on the western shore of the Delaware Estuary at the transition between wave-dominated sandy shorelines to the south and muddominated wetland shorelines to the north (Fletcher et al., 1992). Since the late 19 th Century, the shoreline at the open boundary of the Refuge has been retreating at a mean rate of ~2 m/yr, and within the Delaware Estuary is a hotspot of shoreface erosion (Pijanowski, 2016). Additionally, marsh pond expansion during the past ~75 years has significantly decreased the area of vegetated marsh. Refuge managers and the State of Delaware are concerned about the rapid loss of the salt marsh platform and in recent years have taken measures to better understand the underlying processes. The observational study described in this thesis 1) quantified lost marsh area over the past 55 years, and 2) measured marsh accretion and sediment accumulation rates to provide context for ongoing Refuge management and research efforts. Chapter 2"}, {"section_title": "BACKGROUND", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Marsh Accretion and Elevation Change", "text": "Conceptual models of salt marsh development have been proposed by numerous researchers and adapted into predictive models that assess marsh vulnerability to changes in tidal hydrology and sedimentation conditions (e.g., French, 2006). The stability of the marsh platform depends on its elevation within the tide frame. To maintain an elevation between mean tide level and mean high water, the zone of maximum belowground biomass production (Morris et al., 2002), the elevation of the marsh platform must rise, or accrete, at a rate greater than or equal to the rate of relative sea level (RSL) rise. This equilibrium is maintained by the accumulation of mineral sediment and organic matter (Redfield, 1972;Allen, 2000); the former is transported in suspension to the marsh platform, while the latter is deposited as organic detritus or produced in situ as roots, rhizomes, stems, and leaves. Sediment accumulation is offset by subsidence, including autocompaction of surface sediment layers and deeper isostatic adjustment, which lowers the elevation of the marsh platform. A simplified view of this relationship was described by French (2006) and is given by: where elevation change (\u2206 ) of the marsh relative to RSL in a period of time equals the amount of vertical sediment accretion (\u2206 + \u2206 ), minus sediment compaction (\u2206 ), minus the rise in RSL (\u2206 ) over the same time period. Interactions among local hydrodynamics, sediment supply, elevation, and ecologic processes control soil volume which drives vertical accretion of the marsh platform ( Figure 1). Pethick (1981) proposed that rates of sediment accumulation and accretion are influenced by the depth and frequency of flooding. Because lower elevation areas are flooded more frequently and for longer durations, suspended particles have more time to settle. As elevation within the tidal frame increases, the rate of accretion decreases, eventually reaching an equilibrium value at or near the rate of RSL rise. This relationship has been observed in some marshes over short time scales (French and Spencer, 1993;Cahoon and Reed, 1995), but not all marshes exhibit this pattern Boyd et al., 2017). Elevation and tidal hydroperiod also play a role in determining the volume and structure of organic matter present in marsh soil. For every species of plant on the marsh platform there is an optimal elevation where primary production and biomass formation are maximal (Morris et al., 2002). When the marsh elevation falls above this optimal elevation, marsh flooding occurs infrequently and evapotranspiration increases soil salinity to levels lethal to plants. When the elevation is too low, sulfide accumulation and hypoxia in the soil decrease productivity, biomass formation, and soil volume. When excessive these processes may result in marsh dieback and cause the marsh to revert to a pan or unvegetated mudflat."}, {"section_title": "Processes that Control Marsh Boundaries", "text": "Observations and numerical modelling of salt marshes have shown that the seaward marsh boundary is unstable, retreating landward and extending seaward under variation conditions of wind waves and sediment supply (van der Wal et al., 2008;Mariotti and Fagherazzi, 2010). Areas that are regularly flooded and maintain an elevation that approaches mean high water will remain marshland. As RSL rises, an established marsh will increase its surface elevation by accreting at approximately an equal rate to maintain the optimal position within the tide frame (Morris et al., 2002). Saltwater intrudes into upland areas, killing freshwater plants and allowing for the upland migration of marsh vegetation\uf0bethis influences the landward boundary of the marsh. As the marsh migrates landward, hydrodynamic and meteorological processes cause platform loss in other sections of the marsh. The most common of these processes is edge erosion by waves, the chief mechanism of marsh loss in coastal environments (Marani et al., 2011). Edge erosion often occurs at the shoreface where fetch and water depth allow for maximum wave power. The presence of wetland plants in the intertidal zone has been suggested to reduce rates of wave erosion (M\u00f6ller et al., 2014), however, other studies have refuted this claim (Feagin et al., 2009). Another mechanism of marsh deterioration is the formation of inland pools, which are unvegetated depressions filled with salt water throughout the tidal cycle (reviewed by Mariotti, 2016). These pools form when marsh vegetation dies, either through physical processes, such as ice rafting or wrack deposition, or biogeochemical processes related to root waterlogging or high soil salinity (Van Huissteden and Van de Plassche, 1998). When waterlogging occurs, anaerobic decomposition of organic matter and sulfate reduction may destroy soil structure created by living roots and rhizomes, causing local subsidence and increasing pool depth. This has been observed by DeLaune et al. (1994) who attribute ponding to peat porosity collapse. Studies have noted that the area of pools in salt marshes worldwide has increased (Pethick, 1974;Kearney et al., 1988;Hartig et al., 2002), which some authors attribute to sea level rise and accretionary deficits. Alternatively, Wilson et al. (2014) suggest that the formation of pools may be related to the drainage characteristics of the salt marsh complex, independent of marsh platform accretion. Wilson et al. (2009Wilson et al. ( , 2010 describe marsh pools as temporary, cyclic features that form, enlarge, and infill as plants revegetate. As pools enlarge and deepen, they become more susceptible to erosion by locally derived wind waves, which in some cases may cause irreversible marsh erosion (Mariotti and Fagherazzi, 2013;Mariotti, 2016).  (Kauffman et al., 2011). The Refuge fringes the confluence of the Leipsic River and the western shore of the Delaware Estuary, which formed in the incised valley of the ancestral Delaware River (Figure 2). Tidal marsh wetlands, including salt, brackish, and freshwater marshes, have fringed the estuary since early Holocene times (9-7 ka). Following the collapse of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and ensuing deglaciation, thermosteric expansion of ocean water caused sea levels to rise globally. Coupled with rising global sea level was regional subsidence related to relaxation proglacial forebulge and compaction of coastal plain strata (Horton et al., 2013;Nikitina et al., 2015). Together, rising sea level and sinking land caused Delaware Estuary submerge and widen during the Holocene (Knebel et al., 1988). According to Nikitina et al. (2015), between 2200 and 150 yr BP the average rate of RSL rise in the Delaware Estuary region was 1.25 \uf0b1 0.27 mm/yr, mostly due to subsidence. Land elevation surveys by Holdahl and Morrison (1974) Nikitina et al. (2003) report that Bombay Hook began to experience transgression 5 ka with the formation of brackish marsh within the Leipsic River Valley. These brackish conditions continued until about 1 ka when salt marshes began to replace brackish marshes as the dominant facies. This timeline is consistent with the one described by Fletcher et al. (1992), which places the turbidity maximum depocenter at the confluence with the Leipsic River between 6 ka and 4 ka. Today, the turbidity maximum zone of the estuary extends from the mouth of Christina River seaward to Artificial Island, approximately 22 km north of the study area (Sommerfield and Wong, 2011 Rivers (~11 m at their deepest points), which are connected by a series of smaller tidal channels. Prior to the mid-19 th Century, the Leipsic and Simons rivers converged at a single inlet to the east of the current shoreline. Since that time the shoreline has eroded landward of the confluence of these rivers to form two tidal inlets. Spring tide range in Refuge waterways ranges from 2.0 to 2.5 m (DNREC unpublished data), somewhat larger than the tide range in adjacent estuary waters (1.9 m at Ship John Shoal)."}, {"section_title": "Human Intervention", "text": "Human occupation of the Delaware coast has resulted in rapid changes to the   Young (1985) calculated a loss of 539 acres of salt marsh between 1980 and 1984. Her study concluded that \"eatouts\" cause delayed maturation of and a reduction in plant height, however, no change was found in belowground growth. In the year following \"eatouts\", ungrazed plants have been able to restore the marsh platform demonstrating an ability to rapidly recover. Monitoring of geese populations in at the Refuge between 1976 and 1993 indicated an increasing trend of snow goose foraging at the Refuge. However, a comparison of Spartina alterniflora cover over the same time period indicated that the marsh appears to be able to recover (Smith, 1994). The purpose of the present study was to investigate salt marsh sedimentation conditions at the Refuge to provide context for ongoing studies of marsh loss by inland pooling and estuary shoreface erosion. Following observations of marsh loss by pooling in other tidal wetland systems (e.g., Day et al., 2011), it was hypothesized that pooling after ~1950 is a consequence of a marsh accretionary deficit caused by insufficient mineral sediment supply from adjacent tidal waterways. To test this hypothesis, marsh accretion and sediment accumulation rates were measured by 137 Cs and 210 Pb chronometry at 19 sites throughout the Refuge and compared to local tide-gauge records of RSL rise. Additionally, patterns and rates of marsh loss were quantified through an analysis of historical aerial photographs. The findings from this study will be used to guide the management and restoration decisions of refuge managers moving forward.

The depth of the peak divided by years elapsed between 1963 and the year of core collection provides the accretion rate. Error bars for the 137 Cs-derived accretion rates were calculated by considering 1 cm of vertical error in the depth of the peak. In cases where the uncertainty in 137 Cs activities caused an ill-defined peak, both intervals were considered in depth calculation errors. Downward \"tailing\" of 137 Cs was observed in some cores, so the first occurrence of 137 Cs in the profile, consistent with the environmental onset of 137 Cs in 1954, was not used as a chronological marker (DeLaune et al., 1978). Rates of marsh accretion and accumulation were also measured using 210 Pb in an attempt to develop a longer (~100 year) chronology. Whereas the 137 Cs peak provides an absolute date, 210 Pb is a relative dating method with a variable dating range dependent on the initial surface activity. The relationship between 210 Pbxs activity and accretion rate at steady state is given by: where \u03bb is the decay constant for 210 Pb (0.0311 y -1 ), AR represents the accretion rate (cm/yr), A0 is the initial activity of 210 Pbxs (mBq/g) at the surface of the core, and Az is the activity of 210 Pbxs (mBq/g) at depth z (cm).

Based on the analysis of aerial photographs, in 1961 the area of salt marsh at the Refuge was 47,936,000 \u00b1 2,714,000 m 2 .

To further characterize patterns of marsh extent at the Refuge, locations of marsh loss or gain were classified according to their proximity to the waterways ( Figure 6, Panel 4). Areas of loss or gain adjacent to the estuary shoreface were classified as shoreline change, whereas changes along tidal creeks were classified as tidal creek widening or migration. Inland pooling was classified as expansions in nonchannelized areas, which could either be attached or unattached to tidal creeks. Landward extension or loss of salt marsh along the western boundary of the Refuge was classified as upland change. Of the 8.6 million m 2 of lost marsh, approximately half was due to inland pooling (Table 2).

In general, bulk density was uniform with depth in cores, and in only three of the cores (discussed below) were there noteworthy down-core changes. Previous studies have shown that bulk density increases with depth because of compaction (Ward et al., 1998;Bricker-Urso et al., 1989, Kearney et al., 1994, but this was not observed for soil profiles measured for this study. Overall, organic matter concentration (Eq. 5) was uniform with depth at ~0.1 g/cm 3 with a slight increase in the top 5-10 cm. Since the organic matter concentration was more-or-less consistent among the sampling sites, differences in the total dry bulk density were mostly related to differences in mineral sediment concentration (see Eq. 4). Results of a Welsh's t-test indicated that the mean bulk density of low marsh soils (mean bulk density = 0.44 g/cm 3 , \u03c3 = 0.08) was significantly higher than that of the high marsh soils (mean bulk density = 0.29 g/cm 3 , \u03c3 = 0.06). Two exceptions were soils at sites characterized by mixed high-marsh (STEAM03) and low-marsh (KENT01) vegetation which had relatively high and low bulk densities, respectively (Figure 7). Cores LTHB01, INT2, and AFA02A displayed marked down-core decreases in bulk density. For example, at a depth of 33 cm in core LTHB01, there was a decrease in bulk density from ~1.5 g/cm 3 to ~0.4 g/cm 3 mostly due to an increase in mineral sediment concentration. Similarly, soil profiles for sites AFA02A and INT2 display a down-core decrease in bulk density, again, due to a decrease in mineral sediment concentration from top to bottom. Since these decreases were not observed at the other coring sites, it evokes localized changes in the supply or trapping efficiency of allochthonous mineral sediment. Another way of presenting the marsh soil properties is in terms of soil volume composition (Figure 8). Volume composition may be more meaningful than mass concentration because it conveys the relative contributions of organic matter, mineral sediment, and pore space on soil volume and marsh accretion rate. Overall, soil volume at the coring sites is composed of mostly water (73 \uf02d 96%) with lesser contributes by mineral (2 \uf02d 20%) and organic (2 \uf02d 12%) solids."}, {"section_title": "Radionuclide Activity Profiles and Inventories", "text": "Radionuclide inventories and accretion rates are listed in Table 3, and core profiles are presented in Figures 9, 10, and 11.

These results fall within the range of reference inventories established for Mid-Atlantic region soils by Graustein and Turekian (1986) (82-250 mBq/cm 2 ); however, some of the higher inventories at the Refuge fall near the upper end of the reference range, perhaps due to a non-atmospheric source of 137 Cs. In all but three of the cores 137 Cs activity was detected at the surface, which, given that atmospheric fallout of 137 Cs has been negligible since the 1980s, suggests that there is a reworking of previously deposited 137 Cs. A 137 Cs peak was detected in 17 of the 19 cores ( Figure 9). The depth of the peak ranged from 9 cm at STEAM03 to 49 cm at SD2. INT1 and SD1, the two cores lacking a 137 Cs peak, were both longer than 50 cm.

Accretion rates for each core were also calculated using profiles of 210 Pbex following Equation 7. These rates ranged from 0.29 \u00b1 0.2 to 1.33 \u00b1 0.06 cm/yr. Although there can be methodological differences in measured accretion rates, a Welsh's t-test found no difference between the means of the 137 Cs and 210 Pb rates determined for this study (p-value = .56, n = 17). Results of a Welsh's t-test indicated that the average 137 Cs-derived accretion rate at low marsh sites (mean accretion rate = 0.65 cm/yr, \u03c3 = 0.21) was significantly higher than those at high marsh sites (mean accretion rate = 0.43 cm/yr, \u03c3 = 0.09). These average rates are similar to those reported in a meta-analysis of North American and European salt marsh accretion rates by Kirwan et al. (2016). In general, lower accretion rates at high marsh sites has been interpreted to reflect less frequent tidal flooding that low marsh sites and less mineral sediment deposition (Redfield, 1972). This interpretation is consistent with results of the present study, which indicate higher concentrations of mineral sediment in the low marsh soils. Cesium-137 derived rates of mineral sediment and organic matter accumulation calculated using Equation 8 are listed in Table 3 and presented in Figures 13 and 14. A Welsh's t-test indicated that the average 137 Cs-derived total mass accumulation rate at low marsh sites (mean mass accumulation rate = 0.31 g/cm 2 /yr, \u03c3 = 0.13) was significantly higher than those at high marsh sites (mean mass accumulation rate = 0.13 g/cm 2 /yr, \u03c3 = 0.05). Mineral and organic mass accumulation rates correlated strongly with rates of accretion (R 2 = .85 and .79 respectively) ( Figure 15). These strong correlations imply that both mineral sediment and organic matter contribute to accretion of Refuge marshes, and that belowground biomass accumulation and above ground mineral sediment deposition set the minimum and maximum rates of marsh accretion, respectively. Previous studies have demonstrated that marsh accretion and accumulation rates have an inverse relationship to elevation on a transect scale as increased flooding frequency and duration allows for more sediment to be deposited on the marsh platform (Pethick, 1981;French, 1993). In this study, regression analysis indicated no apparent relationship between marsh surface elevation and measured accretion or mass accumulation rates, consistent with prior studies of marsh accretion in the Mid-Atlantic region (Boyd et al., 2017).

Based on the regression analysis, about 85% of the variation in accretion rate at Bombay Hook NWR can be explained by variation in mineral sediment accumulation ( Figure 15). In other words, aboveground processes of mineral sedimentation (sediment supply, canopy density, particle trapping) play a larger role in moderating accretion rates than belowground processes (root-rhizome productivity, biomass formation). Previous research by Pethick (1981) suggests that the depth and duration of tidal flooding at a location promote the sedimentation of allochthonous sediment by settling. In studies of marsh transects, spatial variability has been widely documented with channel-adjacent sites having a higher sediment availability, and thus sediment accumulation rate, than interior marsh areas (DeLaune et al., 1983;Hatton et al., 1983, Stoddart et al., 1989. However, in this study, no refuge-scale relationship between radionuclide-derived sediment accumulation rate and core site elevation was observed (R 2 =.05), and there were no relationships between the sediment accumulation rate distance to nearest waterway channel. "}, {"section_title": "Sediment Production by Marsh Edge Erosion", "text": "Mariotti and Carr (2014) and Reed (1989) identified marsh edge erosion as an important source of mineral sediment and particulate organic matter to interior marsh platform. In modelling studies linking horizontal marsh loss with vertical marsh accretion, Mariotti and Carr (2014) found that edge erosion can provide a short-term mechanism for marsh resilience, by providing sediment to the marsh platform in times of reduced external sediment input. To quantify the mass of internally produced sediment at the Refuge, the mass of mineral sediment accumulated on the marsh platform between 1961 (the year of the aerial survey) and present day was compared with the mass of sediment lost through erosion along the shoreface, expansion of inland pools, and adjustment of waterway channels over the same time period. The mass (kg) of marsh soil gained since 1961 was estimated by multiplying the mineral sediment inventory (kg/m 2 ) at coring sites by the current area of the marsh platform (m 2 ). The sediment inventory is the product of the mineral sediment accumulation rate (derived from MAmin in Table 3 and converted to kg/m 2 /y) and the number of years between 1961 and the year of core sampling (y). To improve the accuracy of the calculation, the marsh area was binned into high and low marsh zones (as shown in Figure 3), with Phragmites marsh considered high marsh, multiplied by mean sediment inventories of 137 kg/m 2 and 45 kg/m 2 , respectively. The volume of marsh soil lost since 1961 was calculated by multiplying the area of marsh platform loss (Table 2, Figure 6) by a representative soil column height (Table   4). Marsh loss due to inland pool formation was separated into either high marsh or low marsh pools by the surrounding vegetation. Pools surrounded by low marsh vegetation were, on average, deeper and thus were assigned a larger column of lost soil (1 m compared to 0.5 m). Soil loss due to shoreface erosion was assumed to remove a soil column that approximates the spring tide range (2 m), whereas loss along tidal channels were assumed to remove a 1 m column. To estimate the corresponding loss of mineral sediment mass, the soil volumes were multiplied by a mean mineral concentration for high marsh (190 kg/m 3 ) and low marsh (360 kg/m 3 ) soils based on the core physical properties data. Over the past 55 years the mass of mineral sediment added to the marsh platform was an estimated 3.55x10 9 kg, whereas the amount lost was 3.2x10 9 kg. If these values are considered equivalent given the large uncertainties involved, then it would appear that the marsh sedimentary system is more-or-less balanced despite the extent of marsh edge erosion. Hence, this result argues against the hypothesis that there is a deficiency in sediment supply to Refuge marshes. Moreover it suggest that, even if there were no external inputs of mineral sediment from the Refuge watershed or Delaware Bay, sediment produced internally by edge erosion could sustain the measured rate of marsh sediment accumulation."}, {"section_title": "Spatial Variability of Salt Marsh Platform Loss", "text": "Over River may be protected from waves generated from southerly winds, while the inverse is true for the shoreface south of the Mahon River. This wave climate would cause the southern shoreface of the Refuge to be subjected to a higher average yearly wave power, resulting in higher shoreline retreat rates. The expansion of large inland pools is concentrated in the northern half of the refuge between the Leipsic River and Sluice Ditch. Previous studies have demonstrated that pools can form as a result of disturbances that stress vegetation, and expand through biogeochemical processes that reduce or preclude production of belowground biomass, or physical processes such as ice rafting or wrack deposition (Redfield, 1972; van Huissteden and van de Plassche, 1998;Mariotti, 2016). Some studies have alluded to waterlogging following storms or land subsidence as culprits for pool formation (Warren and Niering, 1993;Kelley et al., 1995;Hartig et al., 2002). Although the initiation and expansion of pooling at the Refuge is unknown, results of this study strongly suggest that a marsh accretionary deficit related to low mineral sediment supply can be ruled out. As observed in many North American coastal marshes (e.g., Jefferies et al., 2003), goose herbivory is a cause of vegetation stress at the Refuge. Previous studies at the Refuge have demonstrated that goose herbivory and marsh loss have coincided in the past (Young, 1985), yet more recent work suggests that the marshes within the Refuge and elsewhere in the mid-Atlantic region are able to quickly recover and even gain vegetated platform area, despite increased grazing rate from growing geese populations (Smith, 1994). This indicates that herbivory is most likely a secondary stressor and not the primary cause of pooling. Wilson et al. (2014) proposed that the formation of inland pools may be related to the drainage density of the salt marsh complex. Drainage density in a salt marsh is calculated by dividing total channel length of all creeks and rivers within a marsh complex subbasin by the total subbasin area. Mariani et al. (2003) found that the channel length of salt marsh basins within the Venice Lagoon are defined by basin area. They also observed a correlation between channel length and tidal prism volume, however, this relationship differed among basins. From these two relationships, they suggest that a salt marsh channel configuration is \"frozen\" once the marsh platform develops vegetation and can only undergo minor changes in response to future hydrodynamic forcing. In her study, Wilson et al. (2014)  Poor drainage could have led to waterlogging stress and die off in marshes immediately adjacent to the impoundment. Ongoing hydrodynamic studies and numerical modeling may offer insight into the processes behind this pooling at the Refuge (Abdolali et al., 2016). If this process is occurring at Money Marsh and Leatherberry Flats, geese herbivory may be slowing or preventing the recovery process but remain unrelated to initial pool formation."}, {"section_title": "Salt Marsh Loss and Estuarine Transgression", "text": "I hypothesize that the formation of inland pools in the Refuge is driven by a combination of natural (estuary transgression) and anthropogenic (marsh impoundment) factors that influence water exchanges between tidal waterways and marsh platform. In general, transgression is characterized by shoreface erosion and marsh loss on the seaward boundary as the shoreline migrates landward and upward, along with an increase in estuarine surface area. Estuary widening increases the tidal prism of the estuary provided the tidal range remains the same (Pethick and Lowe, 2000). The increase in estuarine tidal prism will extend into the salt marsh complex, because water levels within the marsh channels are driven by the rise and fall of coastal tides. The tidal prism of a salt marsh complex is contained within tidal channels most of the time (undermarsh tides), but extends over the marsh during spring tides and storm tides (overmarsh tides). During overmarsh tides, the water level within tidal channels increases, until all channels within the network are completely filled. This volume of water is known as the \"bankfull tidal prism\" of the marsh (Allen, 2000). When water height continues to increase, water floods low elevation marsh platforms adjacent to channels and creates the \"overmarsh tidal prism\". The size of this prism determines the flooding and inundation characteristics of the marsh platform, which may be better described by the term \"hydraulic duty\" (Allen, 1997). Hydraulic duty is calculated by dividing the overmarsh tidal prism by the catchment area, and describes the average difference between the mean marsh platform elevation and high water level. In cases where the hydraulic duty is too large, the marsh platform may become \"over-inundated\" and drown vegetation, or the marsh complex may respond through increased connections to its creek network (Allen, 1997). Hydraulic duty may be limited by either reducing the overmarsh tidal prism (through lessening the overall tidal prism or increasing the bankfull tidal prism) or increasing the surface area of the salt marsh. Thus, the lengthening, deepening, or widening of tidal creeks will reduce the amount of water needing to be drained from the marsh platform. Marsh platform accretion provides the dual benefit of maintaining a conducive elevation for plant survival, while increasing the elevation of the marsh platform relative to tidal channels, which contributes to an optimal balance between the bankfull and overmarsh tidal prism. The surface area of the marsh can be increased through upland migration, which may also permit the lengthening of tidal creeks. Following the processes described above, the formation and growth of inland pools in the northern section of Bombay Hook NWR could be a response to an increase in hydraulic duty of the marsh. Specifically, there was a decrease in marsh surface area as a result of transgressive erosion of the estuary shoreface and marsh impoundment on the seaward and upland boundaries, respectively, but the tidal prism remained the same, at least temporarily. Since channel length (bankfull tidal prism) and salt marsh area would have both decreased during this period of marsh loss, the hydraulic duty would have increased, over-inundating the marsh platform. Moreover, the tide range may have even increased somewhat over the past several centuries as transgressive erosion destroyed the former confluence of the Leipsic and Simons Rivers, and created two tidal inlets from one. The former confluence would have presented more hydraulic resistance to the propagating oceanic tide, perhaps reducing the former tide range in the marsh interior. In response, areas of marsh platform connected to tidal creeks drowned, creating mudflats that flood during high tides and are left exposed during low tides, effectively increasing the bankfull tidal prism, and reducing the hydraulic duty. In summary, when landward migrating salt marshes encounter natural or anthropogenic barriers, they lose their ability to increase their surface area to maintain an optimal hydraulic duty for drainage and plant growth."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 7 CONCLUSIONS", "text": "This study investigated the rates of accretion and mineral sediment accumulation at Bombay Hook NWR to determine whether vertical accretion at the Refuge is limited by insufficient mineral sediment supply. To accomplish this, a comparison of historical aerial photographs was undertaken to establish patterns and rates of marsh loss over the last ~50 years. 137 Cs and 210 Pb chronologies were developed for 19 marsh sites throughout the Refuge to measure rates of mineral sediment and organic matter accumulation (mass/area/time) and vertical accretion (length/time) of the current marsh complex.

This study concludes that the current marsh complex at Bombay Hook NWR is not experiencing an accretionary deficit related to insufficient mineral sediment supply. Furthermore, the marsh soil record provides no evidence of changing sedimentary conditions over the past 50-80 years. While recent marsh loss along the shoreface can be attributed to high wave energy in the Delaware Bay, the expansion of inland pools in the northern section of the Refuge in the past 75 years remains a mystery. This study suggests that neither marsh accretion rates nor insufficient mineral sediment supply are causes of pool formation. Additional research on historical changes in tidal inundation, marsh accretion, and elevation change is needed to better understand the nature of pool expansion and marsh loss at the Refuge.
