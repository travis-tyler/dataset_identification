[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is the second virus to cause a human pandemic in the 21 st century and the third novel betacoronavirus to emerge as a human pathogen in the last 18 years. 1 As of this writing, over 13 million cases have been identified worldwide, and almost 600,000 deaths have been reported. 2 These are certainly underestimates, in part related to the now-apparent wide spectrum of disease ranging from asymptomatic individuals, to severe disease, to death, as well as the dearth of diagnostic testing and standardized reporting. In a mere 28 weeks, we have learned much, but far more remains to be learned. The genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was solved very quickly, and within weeks the sequence was widely available, identifying it as a betacoronavirus with close genetic similarity to SARS-CoV-1. We have learned the cellular receptor used by this virus and the concomitant inflammatory cytokine storm that can result from infection. We have identified the approximate reproductive number and the infection fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 and are witnessing the wide spectrum of clinical and human immune responses to infection with the virus. We have also learned that severe disease and death vary by patient age, comorbidities, smoking status, BMI, when in the context of a localized epidemic one presents for medical care, and other factors. At this time, there are no validated point-of-care assays for rapid diagnostics that have been widely deployed, no licensed antivirals, and no licensed vaccines for use in civilian populations. Absent a safe and effective vaccine, safe achievement of herd immunity will prove elusive. While multiple vaccine candidates were developed against the SARS-CoV-1 and MERS viruses, no vaccine candidates progressed past phase I studies. This review will focus on the current development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and address issues relevant to devising a safe and effective vaccine. To gather material for this review, we scanned the PubMed database from 1963-2020 for all publications using the following search terms in various combinations: SARS, MERS, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, vaccine, clinical trial, coronavirus, pandemic, vaccine development. We also did a web search for these same terms. We also examined the World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other public health authority websites."}, {"section_title": "SARS-CoV-2 Disease/Outbreaks", "text": "In December 2019, a cluster of atypical viral pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was reported to the World Health Organization (WHO). It was reported that most patients exhibited respiratory symptoms consistent with severe acute respiratory disease (SARS) and had previously visited the Huanan seafood wholesale market, suggesting an animal origin of SARS-CoV-2. Subsequently, person-to-person transmission through droplets or direct contact occurred, resulting in the early January 2020 declaration by Chinese health authorities that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) had been identified and isolated from patients in Wuhan. [3] [4] [5] Within a month, the full-length genomic sequence of the new coronavirus was made available to the WHO and became publicly available. 6 SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread across the globe. 7 On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic a global health emergency. By March 11, 2020 , the WHO declared a pandemic. The rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has caused fear, panic, economic disruption, morbidity and mortality, and significant public health concerns. 8 Recent data have demonstrated that the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 disease can be very heterogeneous with a broad spectrum of severity, including illness resulting in death. 9 Data demonstrate that asymptomatic individuals can transmit SARS-CoV-2 infection. 10 Individuals over 65 years of age, individuals of all ages who have serious underlying medical conditions, and those who are immunocompromised are at higher risk of serious COVID-19 illness and complications.\nAlthough COVID-19 has been detected in equal numbers of confirmed cases between males and females, there appear to be sex-based differences in severity and mortality to the disease (i.e., higher mortality in older male patients). 11, 12 Considering the alarming outcomes of the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical to develop safe and effective vaccines and antiviral agents to prevent, control, and treat COVID-19. 13 The SARS-CoV-2 virus shares up to 82% nucleotide identity with human SARS-CoV-1 and utilizes the same host cellular receptor as SARS-CoV-1, called the ACE2 (angiotensinconverting enzyme 2), 14 as an entry receptor into host cells. 15 Data from initial COVID-19 studies revealed that ACE2 is differentially expressed in many human tissues, such as lung (alveolar cells type 2), liver (cholangiocytes), stomach (epithelial cells), ileum (enterocytes), kidney (proximal tubules), and colon (colonocytes). 16 Notably, the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 (also a host cell factor for influenza A and other coronaviruses) has recently been demonstrated as critical for activation of the SARS-CoV-2 trans-membrane spike (S) glycoprotein (i.e., the main target of neutralizing antibodies), priming, and viral cell entry. 17 Little is known about SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses during COVID-19 infection.\nHistopathology, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and electron microscopy data from SARS-CoV-1-infected human lung tissue revealed that SARS-CoV-1 can infect and replicate in alveolar macrophages, type I and type II pneumocytes, and bronchiolar epithelial cells. 20, 21 Both Th1-type (IFN\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IP10, MCP1 and IL-6) and Th2-type (IL-4 and IL-10) cytokines are produced in high concentrations in plasma in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating that the host immune response itself is involved in disease progression and pathogenesis. 22\nIn silico study results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 S protein induces an innate inflammatory immune response via NF-kB activation and possibly thru TLR4 ligand. 23 High concentrations of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1) have been detected in serum samples from severe cases of COVID-19 disease compared with levels in serum from moderate cases. This suggests that a massive cytokine storm likely contributes to disease severity. 24 Other factors that have been reported to be associated with disease severity outcomes (e.g., lymphopenia, decrease in CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte counts, suppressed IFN-\u03b3 secretion by CD4+ T lymphocytes, and lower counts of CD16+CD14+ monocytes) may also be potential significant immunologic markers of severe and moderate COVID-19. 24, 25 As per a recent case study report, the increased frequency of antibody-secreting cells, follicular helper T cells, activated CD38+ HLA-DR+ CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes, together with SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM antibodies, detected in the blood of a patient with nonsevere COVID-19 prior to symptomatic recovery, suggests that early adaptive immune-related biomarkers may be predictors of better clinical outcomes. 25 Given SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and tissue tropism, and the significant morbidity and mortality at the public health level, it is essential to develop an effective vaccine to protect against SARS-CoV-2. nucleotide substitution per base per year). 32 33 The SARS-CoV-2 genome exhibits a mutation rate of <25 mutations per year, which is much slower than seasonal influenza virus, but it is virtually certain that further mutations and recombination events will be identified."}, {"section_title": "SARS-CoV", "text": "The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein is a critical factor for binding to ACE2 and to determine tropism and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. 14 Previous mutagenesis studies have suggested that the cross-neutralization resistance between SARS-CoV and palm civet-CoV may result in mutations within the RBD of the S protein. 34 Recent structural analysis of S protein-ACE2 receptor complexes identified several amino acid substitutions and deletions in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD of S protein (i.e., S1 subunit) compared to those of SARS-CoV and Bat-CoV. 35 These mutations resulted in a higher affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to the human ACE2 in comparison with SARS-CoV and Bat-CoV. 35 This is likely associated with the dynamic of viral spreading. Another genetic study examining amino acid mutations in circulating SARS-CoV-2 RBDs has found eight mutation types (from a total of 18 mutant strains) that were divided into two different groups of amino acid mutations in SARS-CoV-2 RBD domain based on human ACE2 affinity to the S protein (i.e., the \"similar affinity\" group: V341I, F342L, R408I, A435S, V483A; and significantly \"higher affinity\" group: N354D, D364Y, V367F, W436R). 36 The study investigators proposed that the \"higher affinity\" group of mutated amino acids (specifically, amino acid mutation V367F) demonstrated an enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity to human ACE2 and may have allowed for increasingly significant infectivity and more severe virus transmission. 37 A pipeline data analysis of real-time mutations in SARS-CoV-2 identified 14 mutations in S protein (including mutation D614G) and a viral recombination event. Recent reports have demonstrated that the D614G mutation increases infection of human cell lines, [38] [39] [40] with mounting evidence that it also influences disease severity. 41 A study published by Fehr and Perlman 42 demonstrated that the human SARS-CoV-2 genome is similar to that of other RNA viruses and encodes for four major structural proteins, including the surface spike (S), small envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The CoV genome also encodes for 5'nonstructural (n=16) and lineage-specific accessory genes (n=6, functionally not well characterized). The Betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been found to encode for an additional structural hemagglutinin esterase (HE) protein that may enhance the S protein-mediated viral infection and generation of infectious virions. 43 The S protein is implicated in host cell invasion and is cleaved by furin-like enzymes into two functional subunits or regions, S1 and S2, which are responsible for host cell receptor binding and host receptor membrane fusion, respectively. 44, 45 The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is primed/activated by the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2, which is essential for viral entry and spread in the infected host. 17 The main factor determining SARS-CoV-2 tropism is the RBD of S protein, which binds to the host receptor ACE2 and can only interact with the RBS when it is in the hinge-like \"up\" conformation in SARS-CoV-2. 46 Notably, SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share a conserved epitope in the RBD that may be an important consideration in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine antigenicity and cross-protective antibody responses. This remains to be further elucidated."}, {"section_title": "Issues in Vaccine Development", "text": "The WHO is coordinating an international group of experts (e.g., scientists, physicians, and industry leaders) who are working to create vaccine candidates and has released a Target Product Profile. 47 that includes both critical and preferred characteristics -the ideal vaccine will have the features outlined in Table 1 . The FDA has recently issued a guidance document on COVID-19 vaccines. 48 This document is primarily focused on regulatory requirements and key considerations for licensure data such as the following: pre-clinical data, characterization of immune responses in animal models, toxicity, minimum efficacy requirements, and the potential for vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease. Despite the relatively mild disease seen in most infants and children and given the relative ease of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, vaccines targeting this audience must also be developed.\nIt is likely that multiple vaccine candidates, each geared toward specific population groups at increased risk, will be necessary. Because we have never had a coronavirus vaccine, it is also likely that we will need long-term data on multiple vaccines in order to identify products that Data from studies on SARS and MERS vaccine candidates have shaped much of the early vaccine development efforts to SARS-CoV-2. 50 Preclinical studies, animal models, and other data have been used to accelerate vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2. These data indicate the following: 1) the S protein is the major target of neutralizing antibodies; 51 2) many of these antibodies target the RBD of S protein; 52-54 3) neutralizing antibodies generated by vaccination or adoptively transferred are protective in animal models (e.g., mice, rabbits, and non-human primates); 55, 56 4) clinical trials of two MERS vaccines, a DNA-based vaccine consisting of the S protein and a replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus expressing the S protein, both elicit robust antibody responses; 5) an MVA-based vaccine expressing the S protein has been used to vaccinate camels and significantly reduces viral loads and virus secretion; 57 and 6) most of the vaccine candidates also induced cellular immunity, which is thought to be critical to viral clearance. [58] [59] [60] Work in these areas continues with an expanded scope that now includes this latest novel coronavirus.\nThis same body of work with SARS and MERS has demonstrated that there are also obstacles that we must carefully navigate. One serious issue is antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection and disease that has been noted in SARS. 61 Interestingly, antibodies targeting the S protein were found to mediate ADE, 62 which results in enhanced infection of macrophages and B cells; 63, 64 therefore, S only protein-based vaccines must be carefully evaluated in terms of safety.\nAnother obstacle facing vaccine development is the fact that animal studies of SARS and MERS vaccines (including formulations that moved into phase I clinical trials) found evidence of lung and/or liver pathology after live-virus challenge. [65] [66] [67] [68] Eosinophilic infiltration, enhanced Th2 responses, and increased infectivity have been noted with both whole virus vaccines and with full-length S protein-based vaccines. 69 The ability of a vaccine to elicit a robust, Th1 type T helper response is considered ideal, given the antiviral properties of this type of response and its suppressive effect on Th2 responses. 70 Yet another issue is the observed lack of durable protective immunity to seasonal coronaviruses. It remains to be seen if the appropriate use of adjuvants and highly immunogenic vaccination platforms are able to overcome this problem. A number of studies have begun to examine immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and have found that antibody responses (IgM, IgG, IgA) appear 1-2 weeks after infection, peak several weeks later, and then decline. Humoral immunity targets the S and nucleocapsid proteins, with neutralizing antibody primarily directed against the receptor binding domain of the S protein. [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] Similarly, infection induces T cell responses (primarily Th1) against a broad range of viral proteins. [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] It has also been shown that T follicular helper responses occur and are correlated with the magnitude of the humoral response. 83 T cell repsonses have also been detected in individuals lacking humoral immunity. 84 Despite these initial findings, our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 immunity is far from complete; therefore, further studies examining innate, humoral, and cellular immune responses to this new virus are necessary in order to fully understand mechanisms of protection that need to be activated by COVID-19 vaccines."}, {"section_title": "Computational Approaches to Accelerate Vaccine Development", "text": "As the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been fully characterized, we have a very limited understanding of the viral proteins that may be important targets of the immune system, which could beuseful for developing effective vaccine candidates. In this respect, predictive computational algorithms may prove to be beneficial tools for the identification of immunogenic T cell and B cell epitopes that can accelerate the rational design of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine formulations. Computational algorithms offer the distinct advantage of rapidly screening the entire amino acid sequence of viral proteins to predict peptides with high antigenicity or binding affinity for HLA molecules-a task that would take countless hours to accomplish in the laboratory while consuming valuable biological specimens. Advancements in machine learning, artificial neural networks, and other computational fields have led to the continued development and refinement of epitope prediction algorithms with improved accuracy, 85 identified both T cell and B cell epitopes from the MERS-CoV S protein that were conserved across clinical isolates, suggesting these epitopes may be used to develop broadly protective vaccines. 96 A similar study focused on the MERS-CoV N protein as a potential vaccine target, identifying candidate B cell (15 linear, 10 conformational) and T cell (10 T-helper, 10 cytotoxic) epitopes for further study. 97 Once individual peptide epitopes have been identified by immunoinformatic approaches, they can be computationally modeled as larger polypeptide assemblies for immunologic evaluation. Srivastava and colleagues employed such an approach to identify cytotoxic and helper T cell epitopes from the MERS-CoV proteome and design two vaccine constructs, both of which were predicted to provide broad global HLA population coverage (94%) and dock with Toll-like receptors. 98 Applying similar immunoinformatic approaches, we comprehensively analyzed 10 SARS-CoV-2 proteins to identify potential targets for inclusion in COVID-19 vaccines. 99 Similar studies detailing the in silico prediction of T cell and B cell epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 began to rapidly emerge following publication of the viral genome sequence.

[106] [107] [108] We have pursued a similar approach, stringently applying combinations of in silico approaches to identify subsets of T cell (CD4 + and CD8 + ) and B cell (linear and conformational) epitopes from the SARS-CoV-2 proteome to serve as candidates for peptide-based vaccine development (unpublished results). These studies demonstrate the utility of bioinformatics and computerbased predictive modeling for designing vaccines against rare and emerging diseases when immunological data and biological samples are limited."}, {"section_title": "Current Status of Vaccine Development", "text": "Some of the first vaccines are already in clinical trials 4-5 months after the start of the outbreak.\nAs of the time of this writing, one vaccine has been licensed in China only for use in Chinese military, three vaccines are in phase III trials, eight are in phase II trials, 11 are in phase I trials, and the remainder in preclinical studies. This amazingly rapid development cycle is due to several factors: existing vaccine candidates, data, and animal models from SARS and MERS; the early publication of the full-length genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2; the striking sequence similarity in the S protein between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2; the use of DNA and RNA \"plug and play\" vaccine platforms; and reduced regulatory burdens due to the urgent nature of the outbreak (Figure 1 ). Examination of the T cell responses in the two lower vaccine-dose (25ug and 100ug) groups and identified the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4+ T cells with a Th1 phenotype. Virusspecific CD8 T cells were detected in the 100ug vaccine group. With regard to safety, no serious adverse events were noted; however, fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, and pain at the injection site were common (i.e., reported in >50% of recipients). Local adverse events were typically mild, although severity was more pronounced at higher doses. Of the five grade-two adverse events noted, only two were deemed to be related to the vaccine. Both (elevated lipase and decreased hemoglobin) occurred seven days after the second vaccination. NIH is now recruiting two additional age groups (51-70 years old and \u226571 years old) to evaluate the vaccine in older populations in a phase II clinical trial and is seeking regulatory approval for a much larger scale Phase III trial to begin during the Summer of 2020. Inovio has developed a DNA-based vaccine that is injected and then electroporated into muscle cells in order to induce host cell production of the S protein.\nThere are over 120 additional vaccines in various stages of preclinical development, and the number increases weekly. [110] [111] [112] This vaccine uses a saponin-based adjuvant, which is a formulation that has been shown to enhance adaptive immune responses to recombinant Ebola glycoprotein vaccines and MVAbased influenza vaccines. 119, 120 CEPI has also partnered with the University of Queensland to develop a protein-based vaccine that uses a \"molecular clamp\" to lock the coronavirus proteins into the correct three-dimensional shape, allowing humoral immune responses to develop against appropriate conformational epitopes. 121 Vaxart is developing an oral tablet-based vaccine that uses a replication deficient Adenovirus 5 vector to deliver recombinant S protein and a TLR3 adjuvant to the mucosal epithelium. 122 An Israeli company, MigVax, is also developing an oral subunit vaccine against COIVD-19. This product is based on their existing vaccine against poultry coronaviruses 123 "}, {"section_title": "causing infectious bronchitis.

VLPs retain the three-dimensional structure and repetitive antigenic nature of viral particles and have been found to be extremely immunogenic. 128 Nearly a dozen groups are working on VLP platforms expressing S protein or RBD. The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center has developed a microneedle skin-patch vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 that induced neutralizing antibody production in mice. 129 Nucleic acid vaccines Nucleic acid vaccines can be rapidly and inexpensively produced and contain no live virus; however, DNA vaccines require complicated delivery systems, generally higher doses, and are more difficult to produce.
