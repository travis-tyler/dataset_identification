Plausible mechanisms explaining the link between LCS consumption and metabolic dysregulation have begun to emerge. A recent study found that LCS consumption induced dysbiosis and altered the composition and function of intestinal microbiota to those associated with weight gain and glucose intolerance. 6 One possible pathway linking dysbiosis and metabolic dysregulation could be the interactions between intestinal microbiota and the enteroendocrine system.\nWhether the dysbiosis induced by LCS affects enteroendocrine physiology has not been systematically investigated. Most human studies have been single-exposure experiments in which LCSs are given once in the form of diet soda, which has not been found to induce any increase in glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide tem is indeed part of the causal pathway involving LCS use and dysbiosis, the potential effects of LCSs on the enteroendocrine system would only emerge after regular exposure. In the present study, we focus on the effects of LCS intake on GIP because it promotes triglyceride storage in adipocytes, enhances lipoprotein lipase activity in human adipocytes, and promotes preadipocytes differentiation. 8 Circulating GIP levels are also significantly higher in obese individuals. 9 We hypothesized that regular LCS consumption would lead to higher postprandial GIP secretion. To test this hypothesis, we used stored plasma samples from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) to compare plasma GIP levels in LCS users vs non-users during 75-g oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT)."}, {"section_title": "| RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "| Study population", "text": "The BLSA is an ongoing observational continuous-enrolment cohort study of normative aging in community-dwelling volunteers aged "}, {"section_title": "| Assessment of LCS use", "text": "In the BLSA, between 1984 and 2008, dietary intake was assessed using a 7-day dietary record. 5 Participants were designated as LCS users if they reported consuming any food or drink containing LCS (aspartame, saccharin, acesulfame potassium, or sucralose) at the visit during which the OGTT was performed or the most recent visit preceding the OGTT if no concurrent dietary record was available.

Table 1 shows that LCS users were more likely to be white (P = .04). No other differences were observed with respect to smoking, physical activity, age, body mass index, year of recruitment, or time between diet diary assessment and first OGTT. No differences were observed for fasting glucose, insulin or GIP using either the first OGTT visit or considering all person visits (135 person-visits among LCS users, 190 person-visits among non-users; Table S1 in File S1). Figure 1 shows the association of LCS use with 2-hour OGTT glucose, insulin and GIP responses after adjustment for covariates. Glucose peaked at 40 minutes within both groups then declined and was virtually identical over the 2-hour assessment (P = .98). By contrast, insulin peaked at 60 minutes then plateaued and began declining at 80 minutes among LCS users and peaked at 40 minutes among nonusers and began declining at 80 minutes; however, the 2-hour change in OGTT did not significantly differ between the groups (P = .18)."}, {"section_title": "| Association of LCS consumption with 2-hour glucose, insulin and GIP responses", "text": "Lastly, GIP increased at 20 minutes and stayed essentially constant over the remainder of the 2 hours in both groups; however, the LCS users had a greater increase in GIP than non-users (P = .037)."}, {"section_title": "| DISCUSSION", "text": "Using data on 325 visits from 232 men and women without diabetes, we found that regular LCS consumption was associated with a greater increase in glucose-induced GIP secretion over 2 hours. GIP promotes triglyceride storage in adipocytes, enhances lipoprotein lipase activity in human adipocytes and promotes preadipocytes differentiation. Another possible mechanism linking LCS consumption and metabolic dysregulation may be through effects of LCS on gut microbiota.\nSuez et al 6 reported that LCS consumption in mice and humans altered the composition and function of intestinal microbiota to those associated with glucose intolerance and obesity; however, incretins were not measured. Emerging evidence links gut microbiota with enteroendocrine function. 13 In mice, 11 weeks of LCS consumption resulted in altered gut microbiota with over-representation of glycan degradation pathways leading to increased formation of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). 6 Petersen et al 14 showed that SCFAs, through increasing expression of transcription factor neuronal differentiation The same group also showed that blocking the NOTCH signalling pathway with dibenzazepine, a \u03b3-secretase inhibitor, led to elevated expression of Neurod1 and subsequent increase in L and K cell numbers as well as increased GLP-1 and GIP secretion. 15 The present study has several strengths including a wellcharacterized cohort with detailed dietary records collected over multiple visits and carefully characterized metabolic profiles. Despite these strengths, some limitations must be acknowledged. First, the BLSA is an observation study, therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility of unmeasured confounders; however, we mitigated this possibility by including many relevant covariates. Second, classification of LCS users and non-users was made using dietary data collected up to 5 years before OGTT samples were obtained; however, previously reported data show that 79% of BLSA participants with multiple diet diaries did not transition between use and non-use. 5 Our findings of an association of regular LCS consumption with greater increases in nutrient-stimulated GIP secretion corroborate and weave together findings from the in vitro and animal studies presented above. 6, 14, 15 One plausible pathway by which LCS consumption may lead to weight gain and obesity is as follows: (1) LCS alters the composition of gut microbiota, resulting in increased SCFA formation, (2) a greater amount of SCFAs in the intestine leads to increased\nNeurod1 expression, which ultimately leads to greater K and K/L cell numbers, and increased GIP secretion, and (3) increased GIP secretion promotes more triglyceride storage in adipocytes, enhances lipoprotein lipase activity in human adipocytes, and promotes preadipocytes differentiation and ultimately weight gain and obesity. This hypothesis needs to be tested in intervention studies."}]
