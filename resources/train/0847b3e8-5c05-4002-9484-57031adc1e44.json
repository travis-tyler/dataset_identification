[{"section_title": "", "text": "Harmonizing DTI measurements across scanners to examine the development of white matter microstructure in 803 adolescents of the NCANDA study "}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "White matter continues to grow in volume and mature in microstructural constituents from birth to late adolescence and early adulthood, as evidenced by convergent in vivo neuroimaging Im et al., 2008; Jernigan et al., 2001; Pfefferbaum et al., 1994; Sowell et al., 2004; Hasan et al., 2010; Lebel et al., 2008; Yeatman et al., 2014; Bava et al., 2010b) and postmortem (Benes et al., 1994; Yakovlev and Lecours, 1967) anatomical studies. The expansion of white matter, measured with structural MRI as increasing volume, and extension of tracts and myelin, measured as increasing fractional anisotropy (FA), decreasing axial diffusivity (L1), decreasing radial diffusivity (LT), or decreasing mean diffusivity (MD) with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) (Barnea-Goraly et al., 2005; Lebel et al., 2008; Snook et al., 2005) , complements the decline in developmental trajectories of cortical gray matter volume (e.g., Pfefferbaum et al., 2013; Raz et al., 2010) and thickness (Chen et al., 2013; Hogstrom et al., 2013; McKay et al., 2014; Schmitt et al., 2014; Sowell et al., 2007; Storsve et al., 2014) . Consistent with these inverse relations, a multi-modal, cross-sectional imaging study of 932 youth, age 8 to 21 years, reported a correlation between lower mean diffusivity in white matter subjacent to regions of cortical thinning (Vandekar et al., 2015) . Similarly, an inverse relation was observed between local FA and gray matter density in 42 adolescents (Giorgio et al., 2008) and cortical thickness in 168, 8 to 30 year olds (Tamnes et al., 2010a) . These complementary dynamic growth patterns are presumed to reflect gray matter pruning of \"unused\" neurons (Chugani et al., 1987; Feinberg, 1974 Feinberg, , 1990 Feinberg et al., 1990; Huttenlocher, 1979; Huttenlocher and Dabholkar, 1997) and newly forming, extended, and increasingly complex fiber connections (Lenroot et al., 2007; Sowell et al., 2004) , likely in response to interaction with the environment.\nAdding to the complexity of neurodevelopment is heterochronicity in regional timing of maturation that characterizes gray matter volume decline and white matter volume increase (Bava et al., 2010b; Raznahan et al., 2010 Raznahan et al., , 2012 ) (for review, Giedd et al., 2014; Stiles and Jernigan, 2010; Toga et al., 2006) . The DTI metrics are especially useful in characterizing the major constituents of white matter, tracking changes through developmental periods, and identifying the maximum or minimum of diffusion MR-based measurements regressed with respect to age (Beaulieu, 2002) . In particular, FA, a measure of local fiber organization, increases with age, from birth (Sadeghi et al., 2013) through late adolescence (Lebel et al., 2008) and beyond (Lebel et al., 2012; Tamnes et al., 2010a; Yeatman et al., 2014) . Some studies report FA of the corpus callosum to be generally highest in early adolescence (Lebel et al., 2008) , whereas others report later-occurring maxima in callosal FA (Asato et al., 2010; Hasan et al., 2009 ) and a posterior-toanterior gradient of development (Asato et al., 2010; Cancelliere et al., 2013; Qiu et al., 2008) . A fiber system showing continued development in adolescence is the superior longitudinal fasciculus (Peters et al., 2012) . In summary, growth patterns estimated from cross-sectional study of children to older adults depict FA as increasing to late adolescence or early adulthood, with growth maxima differing by region (Hasan et al., 2010; Lebel et al., 2012; Yeatman et al., 2014) .\nThe age and region of highest FA and lowest diffusivity vary substantially across reports and are likely attributable to many study differences, including scanner magnet field strength and manufacturer (Papinutto et al., 2013) , acquisition protocol (Basser and Pierpaoli, 1996; Jones, 2004) , quantification method, and participant factors such as age range (Yeatman et al., 2014) , sex (Bava et al., 2011; Hasan et al., 2010; Herting et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012) , ethnicity, head motion (Kreilkamp et al., 2015; Yendiki et al., 2013) , and even exercise (Herting et al., 2014) . One way to confirm characterization of multifaceted dynamics of neurodevelopment is through longitudinal DTI study of adolescent white matter development. The few longitudinal studies currently published are consistent with cross-sectional observations in showing increasing FA throughout adolescence (Bava et al., 2010a; Giorgio et al., 2010; Treit et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2012) (review Paus, 2010) . For example, one study examined 25 boys and girls, age 5 to 11 at baseline with about 2 to 4 years between scans, and observed continued FA increase in the callosal genu, superior and inferior frontooccipital fasciculi, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and uncinate fasciculus (Treit et al., 2013) . Sex differences were detected in FA trajectories of 16 youth, age 13 to 17 years old, examined twice over one year, where boys showed continued increases in FA, whereas girls' trajectories were flat (Wang et al., 2012) . The developmental increase in FA and axonal caliber has been linked to increase in testosterone with advancing puberty in boys (Herting et al., 2012; Perrin et al., 2008 ) but a decrease in FA with increasing estradiol in girls (Herting et al., 2012) .\nTo date, longitudinal studies have been limited in scale with respect to sample size, subject factors, geographical representation, and age distribution. Large-scale, multi-site, cross-sectional studies are an alternative to reconcile published cross-sectional findings on the growth patterns of microstructural white matter as they can provide critical steps to enhance consistency in across-site data collection (cf., Bartsch et al., 2014; Groves et al., 2012) . To harmonize findings across sites, the Pharmacog Consortium developed a multi-site brain diffusion imaging protocol for 10 clinical 3T MRI sites distributed across four countries, whose reproducibility was comparable to those reported in studies using a smaller number of MRI scanners (Jovicich et al., 2014) . Several studies (Bartsch et al., 2014; Kochunov et al., 2015) also proposed to normalize the measurements extracted from the diffusion MRI across sites. Specifically, the intensity values of a single gradient direction of a diffusion MRI are relative scores, whose meaning are defined in relation to the intensity values across all gradient directions. Normalizing the MR values directly requires solving a highly complex and nonlinear mathematically framework that models the relation between those gradient directions. Instead, those studies proposed to normalize scores extracted across the diffusion directions contributing to diffusion metrics. For example, the ENIGMA-DTI consortium harmonized FAbased and genetics measurements collected from multiple sites by combining single-site heritability estimators with a multi-site correction model (Kochunov et al., 2015) . Applied to five datasets containing a total of 2248 children and adults (ages 9 to 85 years), the model showed that genetic factors explained over 50% of intersubject variance in FA values across most regions .\nHere, we proposed a 2-step approach to harmonize FA, MD, L1, and LT maps of multi-center DTI data by first accounting for differences potentially attributable to MR system manufacturer and then participant demographics and clinical scores. We harmonized DTI data acquired on scanners of two different manufacturers based on human-phantom data, i.e., repeated scanning of three non-participants on GE and Siemens scanners. Specifically, we inferred a scanner-specific correction factor from the human-phantom data and applied this correction factor to the DTI-derived maps of the study participants. The second step of data harmonization was based on statistical modeling with covariates defined by demographic and clinical markers. Specifically, skeletons were inferred from the manufacturer-corrected FA maps through Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) (Smith et al., 2006) , which enabled a quantitative survey of white matter of the entire brain. A General Additive Model (GAM) with age, sex, self-described ethnicity, supratentorial volume, socioeconomic status, and pubertal development as covariates was applied to the regional FA, MD, L1, and LT skeleton mean values, which were computed by overlaying the skeletons onto the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) DTI atlas (Mori et al., 2005) . In parallel, permutation testing was applied to the DTI metrics derived skeletons using sex and demeaned age as covariates.\nBased on this 2-step approach, we present baseline findings on DTI data acquired in 803 adolescents (12-21 years old) through the multisite National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA). The study is designed to follow adolescents annually for four years, an age range of significant neurodevelopment and high risk for initiating drinking, often at hazardous levels (MacArthur et al., 2012; Swendsen et al., 2012) . The sample of 803 adolescents comprises two groups with useable DTI data: 671 adolescents who fell within established criteria for no to low alcohol and drug consumption history, and 132 recruits who exceeded alcohol or drug consumption history at baseline. An extensive description of the total NCANDA sample (Brown et al., 2015) , structural MRI baseline findings (Pfefferbaum et al., 2015b) , and neuropsychological results (Sullivan et al., 2016) appear elsewhere.\nUsing these cross-sectional DTI measurements, we tested three hypotheses: 1) Corrected DTI metrics in the no/low-drinking group would reach extreme values at different ages in different fiber systems; specifically, FA would be highest at an earlier age in inferior and posterior fiber systems but at later ages in superior and anterior fiber systems. 2) Given that girls typically undergo pubertal development earlier than boys and that brain maturation has been shown to parallel pubertal stages, the highest FA and lowest diffusivity metrics would be at younger ages in girls than boys in the no/low-drinking group (cf., Herting et al., 2012; Hill et al., 2013; Perrin et al., 2008) . 3) Although adults with a history of alcohol dependence and heavy or binge drinking are reported to have abnormally low FA and high diffusivity measures, the effects on white matter microstructure in youth with heavy alcohol exposure are less clear (for review, Elofson et al., 2013 ). Finally, we tested the hypothesis that youth who exceeded criteria for alcohol or other substance dependence would have lower FA or higher diffusivity measures in later-developing fiber systems than the no/low-drinking group."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Herein are presented brief descriptions of the subject samples, the MR acquisition, the generation of the DTI-derived skeleton values harmonized for scanner difference, and the statistical models used for further harmonization of the data and analysis.

Participants were 333 male and 338 female adolescents, ages 12 to 21 years (Table 1 and Fig. 1 , top) who met basic alcohol and drug use criteria (Fig. 2) for history of no/low consumption in the NCANDA study (Brown et al., 2015) . An additional 132 adolescents exceeded entry criteria for alcohol and drug use, having initiated moderate-to-high alcohol consumption (exceedscriteria group); 9 of this group met criteria for DSM-IV Alcohol Abuse, and 1 met criteria for DSM-IV Alcohol Dependence. Using DSM5 criteria, 36 adolescents in the exceeds-criteria group were endorsed having had alcohol symptoms; 19 met criteria for DSM5 Alcohol Use Symptoms in 12 month, and 13 meet criteria for DSM5 mild Alcohol Use Disorder Diagnosis. Thus, most participants in the exceeds-criteria group did not have a diagnosis of alcohol or substance use. The total group of 803 youth had useable DTI data and passed screening for anatomical anomalies determined by a clinical neuroradiologist (for clinical summaries, Pfefferbaum et al., 2015b) .\nParticipants were characterized by age, sex, pubertal stage using the self-assessment Pubertal Development Scale (PDS) , socioeconomic status (SES) determined as the highest education achieved by either parent (Akshoomoff et al., 2014) , and selfidentified ethnicity (Table 1) . Most subjects reported a single ethnicity (Caucasian, African-American, Asian, Pacific Islander, or Native American) with some reporting dual heritage. There were adequate numbers of the first three types to assign categorical ethnicity with dual-heritage identifications assigned to the minority ethnicity group (e.g., Asian-Caucasian was categorized as Asian) (Fig. 1, bottom) ."}, {"section_title": "MRI acquisition", "text": "T1-weighted, 3D images were collected on the 803 adolescents in the sagittal plane on systems from two manufacturers: 3T General Electric (GE) Discovery MR750 at three sites (209 from UCSD; 157 from SRI; 171 from Duke) and 3T Siemens TIM TRIO scanners at two sites (118 from University of Pittsburgh; 148 from Oregon Health & Sciences University). The GE sites used an Array Spatial Sensitivity Encoding Technique (ASSET) for parallel and accelerated imaging with an 8-channel head coil and acquired an Inversion Recovery-SPoiled Gradient Recalled and a reverse-phase acquisition (Acquisition Time: 1 m 22 s) with b = 0/ 500 and 6 directions (TR = 8000 ms, TE = 89 ms, Thick = 2.5 mm, Number of Slices = 64, FOV = 24 cm, xy_matrix = 96 \u00d7 96, GRAPPA, Acceleration = 2, Resolution = 2.5 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 2.5 mm).

Specifically, the T1-and T2-weighted images were bias field corrected and the T2-weighted images were rigidly aligned to the corresponding T1-weighted scans via Computational Morphometry Toolkit (CMTK) (https://www.nitrc.org/ projects/cmtk/). The T1-weighted images were skull stripped, which was the result of majority voting (Rohlfing et al., 2004) applied to the maps extracted by the Robust Brain Extraction (ROBEX) method (Iglesias et al., 2011) and FSL Brain Extraction Tool (Smith, 2002 ) run on both T1-and T2-weighted scans. Finally, baseline skull-stripped T1-weighted images were registered to the T1-weighted channel of the SRI24 atlas (http://nitrc.org/projects/sri24) (Rohlfing et al., 2010) , the standard space for group-wise analysis of SIBIS, via nonrigid image registration (http://nitrc.org/projects/cmtk) (Rohlfing et al., 2003a (Rohlfing et al., , 2003b .\nAs part of quality control, the pipeline excluded bad single shots, which were defined by the root mean square power deviation, based on all 60 directions for a given slice. Echo-planar structural distortion was corrected using the b = 0 reverse and forward readout data, i.e., the \"pepolar\" procedure (Holland et al., 2010) , also implemented in CMTK. Eddy-current-induced image distortions for each direction were then minimized by first aligning each of the 60 directions of the pepolar-corrected data to the pepolar-corrected b = 0 image using a 2D, 6-parameter affine correction (translation and shear) on a sliceby-slice basis. Each distortion-corrected direction was rigidly aligned to the average across all 60 directions to correct for motion. For quality control, the pipeline recorded the average magnitude of the translational components and the average absolute value of the rotational components of all rigid transformations. Omitted from further analysis were those directions whose combined rotational motion across the three axes was larger than 3 degrees. The remainder of the pipeline confined analysis to the forward acquisition corrected with respect to distortion and motion.\nTo compute FA, MD, L1, and LT maps from the DWI, we first skullstripped the images by non-rigidly aligning the T1-weighted image to the b = 0 image of the corrected forward acquisition with CMTK (Rohlfing et al., 2003a (Rohlfing et al., , 2003b and applying the resulting deformation field to the brain mask of the T1-weighted image. At this point, the pipeline checked again the quality of the data by searching for clear outliers in regional intensity ranges of the skull stripped DWI images and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the corresponding b = 0 scans with respect to the corpus callosum. We then computed the diffusion tensor image from the DWI by applying CAMINO's linear single tensor model approach (Cook et al., 2006) and inferred from the resulting Diffusion Tensor images the FA, MD, L1, and LT maps.\nTo achieve common anatomical coordinates across subjects, each subject's DWI derived data set was registered to the FA channel of the SRI24 atlas (Rohlfing et al., 2010) . Alignment of subject FA to SRI24 atlas space was initialized by concatenating the previously computed atlas-to-subject T1-weighted transformation with the subject T1-tosubject DTI transformation. To this concatenation was fit a single, coarse B-spline nonrigid transformation, which was then refined using intensity-driven registration of the SRI24 atlas FA to subject FA image. The resulting non-rigid transformation was then also applied to MD, L1, and LT maps to align them with the SRI24 atlas."}, {"section_title": "Phantom-based normalization of tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS)", "text": "To compute the TBSS skeletons (Smith et al., 2006) , we first corrected the DWI derived maps for scanner-specific differences across the sites. Accordingly, we acquired 26 DWI scans (University of California, San Diego: 5 visits; SRI International: 6 visits; Duke University Medical Center: 6 visits; University of Pittsburgh: 3 visits; Oregon Health & Science University: 6 visits) from three human phantoms, not part of the study participant group, that traveled to all five sites, two or more times each. Specifically, two women (age 30 and 64) and one man (age 41) visited at least one and no more than two times each site. The average time between baseline and follow up visit for each site was 357 days with a standard deviation of 37 days. We then computed the mean FA, MD, L1, and LT values of each scan with respect to the fullatlas parcellation defined by the JHU DTI Atlas (Mori et al., 2005) . To do so, the FA image of the JHU atlas in FSL was registered to the FA channel of the SRI24 atlas, both at 1 mm 3 pixel size, using a linear, affine registration, based on the normalized cross-correlation similarity measure. Next, the two FA images were nonrigidly registered based on a coarse B-spline grid, which avoids overfitting. Labels from the JHU-ICBM atlas were then mapped into SRI24 space via reslicing of the JHU label map using the nonrigid transformation and partial volume interpolation. Left and right unilateral atlas locations were combined, resulting in 21 bilateral and 6 midline regions from which the mask was inferred. For each scan, we computed the mean FA, MD, L1, and LT values of this mask (Fig. 3) . With the exception of L1, Fig. 3 shows for each subject two clusters (red and blue) clearly separated according to the associated manufacturer type. We therefore corrected each map of the NCANDA sample associated with Siemens scan by applying the ratio between the two scanner types with respect to the mean values across the 26 human phantom visits: Mean FA GE/Mean FA Siemens = 0.916; Mean MD GE/Mean MD Siemens = 1.035; Mean L1 GE/Mean L1 Siemens = 0.996; Mean LT GE/Mean LT Siemens = 1.077). Fig. 3 shows the corrected Siemens scores of the human phantoms in green, whose clusters after correction now better align with the GE ones, especially for FA, LT, and MD. To estimate the error associated with these correction factors, we recomputed the correction factor for each phantom visit at a Siemens site paired with all its visits at GE sites. Based on the result 51 factors per modality, the mean and standard deviation for FA = 0.901 \u00b1 0.029; for MD = 1.046 \u00b1 0.024; for L1 = 0.999 \u00b1 0.015; and for LT = 1.096 \u00b1 0.037. Computing the correction ratio based on the maps of all 803 subjects resulted in a similar outcome to the ratios based on the three human phantoms: Mean FA GE/Mean FA Siemens = 0.916; Mean MD GE/Mean MD Siemens = 1.040; Mean L1 GE/Mean L1 Siemens = 0.999; and Mean LT GE/Mean LT Siemens = 1.085. All of these scores were within one standard deviation of the human phantom based ratios so that the difference in age between the human phantoms and the NCANDA samples was statistically insignificant for these computations. Notably, using the ratio based on the non-NCANDA phantom data rather than on NCANDA samples avoided using the dependent measures to correct themselves. Furthermore, the error between scanner types substantially dropped from before to after correction for FA, MD, and LT. We inferred the error by pairing each phantom visit at a Siemens site with the closest visit within 30 days of the same phantom at a GE site (average number of days between visits was 14.9 days) and then computed the absolute difference between the paired mean values. The average error between the resulting 7 paired FA mean values without correction was 0.04668, which was almost 6 times higher than the error after applying the ratio to the Siemens scans (average error: 0.0078). For the other modalities the error dropped from 0.000032 to 0.000015 for MD, from 0.000019 to 0.000018 for L1, and from 0.000106 to 0.000028 for LT. Finally, the FA-corrected maps of the 803 subjects were transformed into FA skeletons via TBSS, omitting the standard registration step of TBSS as the FA maps were already aligned to the SRI24 atlas. Applying the result template of a skeleton to the other modalities, we created the MD, L1, and LT skeletons according to TBSS protocol. For each modality, we reduced each skeleton to the skeleton mean values of 28 regions, which were defined according to the JHU atlas and its mask. The data presented in Results are mean values for the FA, MD, L1, and LT skeletons for the JHU regions of interest, but referred to simply as \"FA, \"MD,\" \"L1,\" and \"LT.\" Finally, we checked the quality of the data by investigating outliers in average regional scores, which all scans passed."}, {"section_title": "Data release", "text": "To create the data release for this publication, all entries in the NCANDA REDCap database and the previous image processing steps were manually checked for entry errors.

Finally, this archived set of files was then assigned a permanent name for reference and identification."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis of manufacturer-corrected FA skeletons", "text": "Based on the data release, the predictive value of the main effect of age was tested with selected covariates within the no/low drinkers using GAM Tibshirani, 1986, 1990; Wood, 2006 Wood, , 2011 and permutation testing. A second set of analyses examined the differences between the no/low alcohol-use and the exceeds-criteria groups.\nTo test the predictive value of the main effect of age with respect to the region-specific, manufacturer-corrected mean skeleton values, the GAM was complemented with analysis of variance (ANOVA) from the \"mgcv\" package in R Version 3.1.0 [http://www.r-project.org/] separately for each DTI metric. Values of each dependent brain measure were potentially modulated by sex, supratentorial volume (svol), ethnicity, pubertal development (measured with the Pubertal Development Scale (PDS, Brown et al., 2012) ), and Socioeconomic Status (SES, estimated as highest parental education achieved (cf., Akshoomoff et al., 2014) ). We chose supratentorial volume (svol) over intracranial volume (ICV) as a covariate in our model because although these volumes highly correlated (r = 0.993), the inferior boundary of ICV is generally poor defined and includes pouches of CSF that can incorporate anomalous volumes, as occurs with mega cisterna magna (incidence of these anomalies was 22 (~3%) in the total sample of 803 participants (Pfefferbaum et al., 2015b) .\nThe contributions of these covariates were examined in a step-wise manner with sub-models excluding various covariates and categorical predictions. The initial GAM tested the predictive value of age alone. Visual inspection of the data suggested a nonlinear function with maximum FA achieved prior to the oldest age. Therefore, differences in regional, manufacturer-corrected Skeleton Mean values (FA-SM, L1-SM, LT-SM, MD-SM) associated with age were modeled with a thinplate spline (TPS).\nSubsequent GAMs tested age with one or more covariates to enable assessment of the influence of each covariate on the distribution of the dependent measure for each ROI with the full GAM model with respect to region 'r' and subject 'i' being defined for (X = FA,L1,LT,MD) as\nFor each region, we fitted GAMs confined to a subset of covariates to the X-SM values of all subjects. The sample sizes varied slightly across models tested because not all participants had data for SES, PDS, or fell into the three major ethnicities. Restricting the analysis from the full model to covariates shows a significant effect on the FA-SM values (age, sex, ethnicity, and svol); thus we compared the outcome to the GAM model for FA without covariates and, inspired by PING (Bartsch et al., 2014) , applied our proposed GAM with additional covariate manufacturer to the original FA Skeleton Mean values (without correction). For each of the FA-based GAM models, we computed the 99% confidence interval of the age associated with the maximum value of the thin plate spline function TPS(r,\u00b7) by bootstrapping (using 1000 iterations) the fitting of TPS(r,\u00b7) to the residuals of the models (excluding age). We interpreted the resulting age range as the highest degree of fiber organization of the no/low alcohol drinkers in the 12-21 age group. For the diffusivity metrics, we similarly investigated the 99% confidence interval of the minimum of their thin plate spline function TPS(r,\u00b7). In this analysis, the age associated with the highest degree of fiber organization is limited to the age range of the NCANDA study, i.e., 12-21 years, and thus makes no inference about effects outside of that range. Finally, we use the GAM to investigate differences between the no/low and the exceeds-criteria groups.\nIn parallel with the GAM-based analysis, we investigated for each DTI metric differences between the groups on the manufacturerharmonized skeleton scores via FSL's method for permutation testing, \"TFCE Randomize\" (Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement). The testing was confined to 500 permutations, used no/low group vs. exceedscriteria group as the contrast, and included the covariates sex and age, with the latter demeaned. Statistical inference was performed with the TBSS \"corrp\" option (fully corrected for multiple comparisons across space), hereinafter referred to as \"tfce_corrp\" (Smith et al., 2006) . To confirm findings, the analysis was repeated on a subgroup of 101 adolescents in the no/low-drinking group and 116 from the exceedscriteria group. The two subgroups were matched with respect to age, sex, and ethnicity. Furthermore, we repeated the analysis on the no/ low group using sex as contrast and demeaned age as covariate to investigate the effect of sex and age."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Effect of manufacturer harmonization on the no/low-drinking group (N = 671) Fig. 4 (left) shows the distribution of the mean of the uncorrected skeleton values (Global Mean FA, MD, L1, and LT) across the 671 no/ low-drinking adolescents plotted against age. For each adolescent, the mean was computed from the uncorrected values inside the mask defined by the JHU atlas. Blue shows the mean value of samples scanned on 3T Siemens TIM TRIO scanners. For any age group, the mean FA values are generally higher and for MD and LT lower than those acquired on 3T General Electric Discovery MR750 scanners (brown circles), which is also reflected by the average SNR with respect to the corpus callosum of the Siemens data (SNR: 2.8514) being lower than those of the GE data (SNR: 3.1962).

With the exception of L1, which was not related to manufacturer, the variance within these samples with respect to FA, MD, and LT became substantially smaller; the standard error of the regression (i.e., the standard deviation after removing the regression on age) of FA was reduced from 0.0246 to 0.0138, for MD from 0.0000265 to 0.0000230, for L1 from 0.0000261 to 0.0000260, and for LT from 0.0000628 to 0.0000491. Table 2 presents the age associated with the maximum of the regressed spline function for the proposed GAM model applied to the manufacturer-correct FA skeleton mean values and the PING-inspired GAM model applied to the original skeleton FA means. The difference between the maximum of the age-regressed curves computed by both models was within one year for 20 out of 28 regions, and for 23 regions the difference was less than 2 years. For one region, our regression did not report a maximum, but the PING-inspired model did with corresponding ages in the late adolescence (age 19). For the remaining 4 regions, ages below 19 were associated with the maximum of our proposed regression model while the PING-inspired model did not report a maximum within the age range. Table 3 of age on those measurements was less pronounced, with L1 only showing age differences in 3 regions, LT only 4 regions, and MD only 5 regions that peaked with 99% confidence within the age range of 12 to 21. These regions were also identified by our FA-based model with the exception of the corticospinal tract, for which both MD and LT identified the minimum of the regression model at age 16, and the pontine crossing fibers, for which L1 identified the minimum of the regression model at age 18. The age associated with 8 out of the remaining 9 regions was within one year of our FA regression model.\nPermutation testing applied to the no/low-drinking group (N = 671)\nTo investigate the contributions of sex and age, permutation testing was limited to the skeletons of the 671 no/low-drinking participants (338 girls, 333 boys) using sex as a contrast and age as a covariate. Our analysis detected significantly higher skeleton values (p b 0.01), corrected for manufacturer, for boys (voxels with significant higher skeleton are shown in blue in Fig. 5, left) for FA, MD, and LT. Furthermore, testing discovered higher FA and lower MD, L1, and LT along almost the entire skeleton with older age (Fig. 5) .\nGAM applied to the no/low-drinking group (N = 671)\nThe dependent measures were regional and global FA skeleton mean values of the 671 no/low-drinking adolescents and the primary independent measure was age.

This analysis partly reversed the sex effects, such that the FA of the girls was significantly higher than that of the boys in 3 regions (pontine crossing, inferior cerebellar peduncle, and stria terminalis). Whereas girls had significantly higher L1 in the inferior cerebellar peduncle, pontine crossing fibers, and 2 other regions (external capsule and retrosplenial internal capsule), boys had higher L1 values in the splenium and higher LT values in the stria terminalis and in the pontine crossing fibers.

This pattern held for FA in the whole atlas and regionally in the middle cerebellar peduncle, anterior corona radiata, corticospinal tract, internal and external capsule, anterior middle cingulum, and superior frontal occipital fasciculus. In these regions, African-Americans had higher L1 in the anterior corona radiata and lower LT and MD in the middle cerebellar peduncle and internal capsule relative to Caucasians.

In no case did the exceeds-criteria group have lower FA than the no/low group. Rather, FA was higher in the exceeds-criteria than the no/low drinkers in 5 regions: middle and superior cerebellar peduncle, callosal body, medial lemniscus, and posterior internal capsule.\nAmong the 132 adolescents in the exceeds-criteria group, 112 reported one or more binges in the past year, ranging from 1 to 137 episodes. A GAM, testing the predictive value of age, ethnicity, and sex plus the number of binges in the past year, was conducted for each brain metric among the 132 exceeds participants. In no fiber system was the FA skeleton mean value significantly related to the number of binges in the previous year.\nWe applied FSL's \"TFCE Randomize\" technique to the skeletons of the manufacturer-corrected FA values of a data set where 101 no/lowexposure participants had been matched to 116 adolescents from the exceeds-criteria group with respect to age, sex, and ethnicity. Covariates of the permutation model were demeaned age and sex. The comparison resulted in no significant group differences (p b 0.01).

Harmonizing FA, MD, L1, and LT maps across manufacturers entailed the use of human-phantom data to determine a scanner-specific correction factor. In addition, statistical analyses accounted for potential demographic and clinical effected by covariation in the statistical models. Specifically, GAMs tested for age and sex differences in mean FA, MD, L1, and LT skeletons in regions defined by the JHU DTI atlas (Mori et al., 2005) .\nThe results supported the primary study hypothesis that FA in the no/low-drinking group reached maximum values at different ages, and when differences in supratentorial volume were covaried, FA skeleton means reached their highest values at younger ages in girls than boys in the no/low-drinking group.

The permutation testing of the diffusivity metrics complemented FA findings, where diffusivity was lower in older adolescents and L1 and MD was generally higher in boys than girls. By contrast, our results did not support the hypothesis that youth who exceeded exposure criteria would have lower FA or higher diffusivity than the no/low-drinking group; instead, the exceeds group had modestly higher FA than the no/low-drinking group, in several fiber systems. These findings are discussed next."}, {"section_title": "Data harmonization across MR system manufacturers", "text": "The systematic difference in FA, MD, and LT values produced by the two MR system manufacturers of the NCANDA study precluded combining DTI data without devising an adequate correction factor given that FA from the Siemens scanners was significantly higher than FA from the GE scanners and LT and MD from the Siemens scanners was significantly lower than the corresponding measures from the GE scanners. This difference occurred despite installation of equivalent image acquisition parameters between platforms and use of two acquisitions with opposite diffusion gradient polarity (\"pepolar\") (Bodammer et al., 2004; Holland et al., 2010) to minimize spatial distortion induced by B0 susceptibility as the average SNR of the GE scans (SNR: 3.1962) was substantially higher than that of the Siemens scans (SNR: 2.8514). Further, given the known effects of spectral spatial pulses versus fat saturation on slice profile and, therefore, voxel volume, we chose to use fat suppression on both scanner systems, eliminating slice profile as one explanation of scanner differences (Glover et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2010) . Traditionally, acquisition differences due to site differences have been incorporated as a covariate in the statistical model, such as in the PING inspired GAM and other published models (Bartsch et al., 2014; White et al., 2011) , thus decreasing the model's degree of freedom. Instead, we introduced a correction factor determined from measurements acquired from human phantoms whose standard deviation for the FA-based correction factors bracketed the one based on the ratio between the SNRs of the scanner types (SNR of Siemens/SNR of Scatterplots showing the subject specific means of the whole-atlas skeleton FA, MD, L1, and LT, each corrected for sex, race, and svol differences in addition to type of manufacturer based on our correction ratio. Bar graphs of predicted FA, MD, L1, and LT values for a 16-year old by sex and ethnicity (boys in blue; girls in red). GE = 0.892). Lower SNR can lead to higher FA and lower MD and LT estimates, especially for TBSS, which searches for the highest FA values in a region. Imaging phantom data, such as from the ADNI phantom [http:// www.phantomlab.com/products/magphan_adni.php], are also acquired by the NCANDA sites along with structural MRIs of humans to capture spatial distortion and variability across time and scanner platforms for harmonization of structural data. Beyond spatial distortion, designing imaging phantoms to capture fully and accurately the variation in diffusion-weighted, human brain measures across manufacturers remains an open challenge in biomedical engineering. One can, however, use human phantoms, such as in the NCANDA study, which acquired MR imaging data on the same three non-NCANDA participants repeatedly at all five collection sites. For this analysis, we used these data to determine manufacturer-specific correction factors for FA, MD, L1, and LT values. The resulting corrected data produced ageregression slopes that were similar to the slopes produced with the uncorrected data, indicating that the adjustment did not introduce an emergent effect. Critically, the distributions of corrected scores from the two different scanner manufacturers were essentially overlapping. Furthermore, the standard error of the regression was reduced by almost a half for FA, by 13% for MD, and by 22% for LT, but correction only had a minor effect on L1. Thus, the human phantom data proved crucial for harmonizing the FA, LT and MD measurements derived from this multi-site DTI set.\nHeterochronicity in the ages associated with maximum FA skeleton means of major fiber systems Globally and regionally, the FA age regressions of JHU atlas-defined fiber tracts (Hua et al., 2009) were generally better fit with a spline than a linear function, which was also the case for LT-and MD-based regressions. This approach enabled identification of the age at which the spline reached a maximum value within a 99% confidence interval. For FA, exceptions in identifying a peak value were the pontine crossing fibers, fornix, and uncinate fasciculus, suggesting continued development of FA in these fibers beyond the age range of the current sample, which ended at 21.9 years. These findings were also confirmed by the PINGinspired GAM model and less pronounced for the diffusivity metrics. The spline-fit age regression of the global FA skeleton revealed evidence for continued fiber organization in boys and girls up to 18 years."}, {"section_title": "Commissural fibers", "text": "Regionally, the age at which the regressed FA values reached their maximum varied by fiber system but seldom by sex. For commissural fibers of the genu, body, and splenium, the ages associated with the maxima were around the age of 17 years. The PING-inspired GAM model confirmed maxima for the genu and body but at a later age. For the tapetum, the spline of our GAM model did not have a maximum. Early development of commissural tracts (also reported by Lebel et al., 2008 Lebel et al., , 2012 Schneiderman et al., 2007) is essential for robust interhemispheric communication and coordinated functions, including integration of semantics and prosody in speech and language (Fryer et al., 2008) and bilateral motor control (Barral et al., 2006; de Boer et al., 2012; Marion et al., 2003; Muetzel et al., 2008) as also required in sports, which advances during adolescence."}, {"section_title": "Brainstem projection fibers", "text": "Of the five brainstem projection fibers, only the middle cerebellar peduncle had a highest regressed FA mean value at an age (approximately 18 years) that was younger than the maximum studied (cf., Simmonds et al., 2014) . This finding was supported by MD, whose lowest regressed mean value was also at that age. In the second set of projection fibers, 8 of the 10 corticospinal tracts had the highest FA skeleton mean values in the late teen years, 5 of which were confirmed by the PING-inspired GAM within one year. The two exceptions that had no maximum FA skeleton mean value were the principal corticospinal tract, serving postural stability, and the medial lemniscus, which also failed to identify minimum skeleton values for MD, L1, and LT, serving touch, vibratory, and pressure sensation through connections with the thalamus (Ross, 1991) .\nAssociation fibers A common focus of developmental studies of brain microstructure is the system of association fibers because of their role in high-order, cognitive functions that require integration of far-reaching cortical systems (cf., Dick and Tremblay, 2012; Martino and De Lucas, 2014) . All four of the limbic tracts were characterized by a continued rise of FA into young adulthood, which was also confirmed by the GAM. The fornix is a principal connector of limbic circuitry, including Papez circuit, underlying components of declarative memory. Similarly, the inferior cingulum, which makes up the temporal stem, is a conduit to medial temporal, hippocampal function, including memory consolidation (Squire and Zola-Morgan, 1991) , in addition to communication with posterior parietal sites. Disruption of these limbic fiber systems in Alzheimer's disease (AD) contributes to the episodic memory (Nowrangi et al., 2013; Salat et al., 2010; Zhuang et al., 2013) and visuospatial dysfunction common in AD patients (Jacobs et al., 2015) , characteristic of a disconnection-like syndrome (O'Sullivan et al., 2001; Sullivan, 2003) . The anterior/middle cingulate bundle supports communication relevant to high-order, attentional processing, which continues to mature into young adulthood (for review, Stiles and Jernigan, 2010) . The stria terminalis provides structural connectivity among the amygdala, septal nuclei, hypothalamus, and thalamus and intersects with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. These regions and systems are involved in pubertal development, stress modulation, threat monitoring, and addiction (e.g., Koob, 2009 )."}, {"section_title": "PROJECTION FIBERS: Brainstem Tracts", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Association fasciculi", "text": "The superior longitudinal fasciculus and superior frontal-occipital fasciculus exhibited the highest regressed FA mean values around age 18, which was confirmed by the PING-inspired GAM, and around age 19 for the sagittal stratum, which the GAM moved to age 20.

These late-developing fiber systems included the superior longitudinal fasciculus, which has been identified in meta-analyses as the tract most consistently reported to be associated with continued development (Peters et al., 2012) and integral to selective functions of verbal fluency, reading (Hoeft et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2014) , vocabulary (Tamnes et al., 2010b) , and working memory (Ostby et al., 2011; Vestergaard et al., 2011) . Other late-developing tracts were the superior frontal occipital fasciculus (for background, Schmahmann and Pandya, 2007) , damage to which has been found in spatial neglect (Shinoura et al., 2009 (Shinoura et al., , 2010 , and the sagittal stratum, which intersects with language areas (Menjot de Champfleur et al., 2013) and, along with other association fasciculi, can sustain microstructural damage with functional ramifications following traumatic brain injury (Farbota et al., 2014) ."}, {"section_title": "Factors modulating FA in adolescence Sex", "text": "Few sex differences were forthcoming when age was controlled for as a factor. Observation of sex differences, where boy had higher FA than girls, depended on whether supratentorial volume was considered in the GAM. Exceptions were the stria terminalis, inferior cerebellar peduncle, and pontine crossing fibers, where FA was higher in female than male groups. The girls also had higher LT in the stria terminalis and higher L1 in the inferior cerebellar peduncle and pontine crossing fibers than the male group. The earlier maturity of girls compared with boys was evident in longitudinal study of mid-adolescents that showed the regressed FA mean values to be highest at younger ages in girls than boys (Wang et al., 2012) . A 4-year longitudinal study of healthy youth, 12-14 years old at initial DTI, found that in general girls showed earlier FA increases in motor-related tracts than boys, whereas boys showed greater changes in projection and association tracts, although these sex differences were not statistically related to pubertal status (Bava et al., 2011) . A larger-scale, longitudinal DTI study also focused on white matter microstructural development in adolescence and observed that, whereas girls exhibited evidence for white matter maturation through mid-adolescence, boys' changes continued through early adulthood (Simmonds et al., 2014) . As observed in the current study, later-developing fiber systems included corticolimbic tracts."}, {"section_title": "Alcohol use", "text": "Although in our structural MRI study of regional white matter volumes in the NCANDA cohort did not detect deficits in youth who exceeded criteria for drinking compared with the no/low-drinking youth (Pfefferbaum et al., 2015b) , we pursued the hypothesis that regional FA deficits would be apparent in the exceeds-criteria group for two salient reasons: 1) other studies identified FA deficits in heavydrinking youth Jacobus et al., 2009 Jacobus et al., , 2013 ) (for review, Elofson et al., 2013) and 2) FA deficits have been found in adult alcoholics who did not have white matter volume deficits (Pfefferbaum et al., 2014; Pfefferbaum and Sullivan, 2002) . Further, because our structural MRI study of NCANDA youth found that smaller central white matter volumes were modestly correlated with greater numbers of lifetime drinks, we proposed the hypotheses, which were not supported herein, that DTI metrics in the exceeds-criteria group would be related to amount drunk. In the current study, the amount of alcohol consumed was less intense and less frequent than in youth in previous studies, who were commonly recruited from treatment facilities and drank at rates warranting a DSM diagnosis. By contrast, all NCANDA youth, despite excessive alcohol-or drug-use history, were recruited from the community and none from treatment centers. Disruption of microstructural integrity may require greater and more intense alcohol exposure in a larger sample of youth than examined herein. Further, although TBSS has the advantage of surveying white matter of the entire brain, modest compromise of fiber organization might be below detection with TBSS, which is based on tracking the highest FA values along the white matter skeleton. Larger subject samples would also be required to identify shifts in the age of the maximum regressed FA mean values related to excessive alcohol consumption. Another consideration is the plasticity of brain fiber integrity with respect to development and trauma (Dennis et al., 2014; Peters and Sethares, 2003) . If, for example, hazardous or binge drinking does exert an untoward effect on white matter microstructure, disruption might require examination soon after multiple, binge episodes. In support of this speculation is a controlled, longitudinal DTI study of a rodent model of binge drinking (Pfefferbaum et al., 2015a) . Rats were exposed to 4 days of alcohol binge by oral gavage and underwent DTI before alcohol exposure, immediately following the 4-day binge, and after one week of recovery. Whereas control rats showed no FA differences across the 3 scanning sessions, the alcohol-exposed rats showed a significant decline in FA from DTI 1 to DTI 2, succeeded by a return to normal FA following a week of no alcohol."}, {"section_title": "Limitations, considerations, and conclusions", "text": "Inferences about developmental patterns must be made cautiously given the cross-sectional nature of these data and the limited age range. Confirmation of the patterns of the age associated with the highest regressed FA mean values awaits the longitudinal arms of the NCANDA study and higher-order diffusivity measures, which were outside of the foci of this paper. In accordance with the literature (Fischer et al., 2012; Jahanshad et al., 2013; Teipel et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2011) the present analysis identified significant scanner manufacturer differences influencing quantification of the DTI data. Critically, we successfully used traveling human phantom data to correct for these differences. As also noted by (Bartsch et al., 2014; Kochunov et al., 2015) , harmonization of data is an essential step in ensuring that data collected across multiple sites and systems are equivalent, thereby enabling quantification on a common metric. Further, human phantom data will also be invaluable for harmonization of longitudinal data.\nIn conclusion, our cross-sectional analysis of DTI data from a large cohort of adolescents supports the concept that regional heterochronicity characterizes neurodevelopmental patterns of white matter fiber systems. Indeed, evidence was forthcoming with respect to asynchronous development of association fibers that connect cortical brain regions supporting high-order, cognitive functions. The continuing development of fiber bundles suggested herein may render them vulnerable to environmental insult, including hazardous drinking. This apparent plasticity noted in white matter microstructure might also enable speedy recovery of fiber system mildly damaged by such insult.\nSupplementary data to this article can be found online at http://dx. doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.01.061.
