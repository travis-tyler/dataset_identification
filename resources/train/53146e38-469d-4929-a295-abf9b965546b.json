To the first issue, it is important that RTI continues to communicate willingness to schedule test days to fit the schools' schedules and times that minimize the loss of instructional time. With an increased time frame to recruit schools and schedule test dates, RTI In-person visits prior to test day. RTI learned that schools that were visited in person prior to test day were better prepared for the session and generally had higher student participation rates than those that were not visited prior to the session. RTI recommends asking schools to schedule a visit prior to the scheduled session to test the computer equipment; review logistics; and, when possible, work with the students to encourage student participation in the scheduled session. Assistants for session administrators. RTI also learned that setting up the computer equipment takes time and that the RTI-provided equipment can be quite heavy. RTI recommends having an assistant onsite at each session to assist with the computerized administration. An assistant also can help monitor the room when students have a considerable number of questions. Engage an IT coordinator. During the field test, RTI found it invaluable to enlist the support of an IT person onsite at the school to test the computer capabilities and help the session administrator troubleshoot computer problems in the school computer lab on test day. Three of the schools that backed out of the study did so because of problems with the computer labs. Often, the person designated as the school coordinator is not technically savvy and is unable to troubleshoot technical issues that may be encountered in the testing of equipment either prior to the session or on test day. Based on the field test experience, RTI recommends designating an IT coordinator at each school, in addition to the school coordinator, and offering a small honorarium Introduction"}, {"section_title": "Historical Background: The NCES High School Longitudinal Studies Program", "text": "In response to its mandate to -collect and disseminate statistics and other data related to education in the United States\u2016 and the need for policy-relevant, nationally representative longitudinal samples of elementary and secondary students, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) instituted the Secondary Longitudinal Studies program. The aim of this continuing program is to study the educational, vocational, and personal development of students at various stages in their educational careers and the personal, familial, social, institutional, and cultural factors that may affect that development. The secondary longitudinal studies program consists of three completed studies: the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72), High School and Beyond (HS&B), and the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88). In addition, base-year and first and second follow-up data for the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002(ELS:2002, the fourth longitudinal study in the series, are now available. Taken together, these studies describe the educational experiences of students from four decades-the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s-and also provide bases for further understanding of the correlates of educational success in the United States. Figure 1 includes a temporal presentation of these four longitudinal education studies in relation to the expected design for the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09) (at least through 2015), and highlights study components and comparison points.    1979 1972 1980 2000 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 PST ELS:2002 NELS:88 HS&B:10th-grade cohort HS&B: 12th-grade cohort NLS-72 2007 2008 2FU"}, {"section_title": "National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972", "text": "The Education Longitudinal Studies program began more than 35 years ago with the implementation of NLS-72. 1 NLS-72 was launched with a survey of a national probability sample of 19,001 seniors from 1,061 public and private schools.

Base-year data collection took place in the spring term of the 1979-80 academic year with a two-stage probability sample. Some 1,015 schools served as the first-stage units, and 35,723 sophomores and 34,981 seniors within these schools were the second-stage units and eligible to participate (of whom about 58,000 total participated in the base year). Subsamples of both cohorts of HS&B were resurveyed in 1982, 1984, and 1986; the sophomore cohort was also surveyed in 1992. High school transcripts were collected for a subsample of approximately 15,941 sophomore cohort members in the 1982 first follow-up, when most were seniors. As in NLS-72, postsecondary transcripts were collected for both HS&B cohorts. With the study design expanded to include a sophomore cohort, HS&B provided critical data on the relationships between early high school experiences and students' subsequent educational experiences in high school. For the first time, national data were available that showed students' academic growth over time and how family, community, school, and classroom factors were associated with student learning. Researchers were able to use data from the extensive battery of achievement tests within the longitudinal study to assess growth in subject-specific concepts and skills over time.

The sample was also surveyed after scheduled high school graduation, in 1994 and 2000. 3 The NELS:88 base year (1988) successfully surveyed 24,599 students, out of some 26,432 selected eighth-graders, across 1,052 public, Catholic, and other private schools.

HSLS:09 has both deep affinities with and important differences from the prior studies, both of which will be highlighted in the discussion of study design below. Distinctive and innovative features of HSLS:09 include the following: use of a computer-administered assessment and student questionnaire in a school setting; a focus on algebraic reasoning; use of computerized-only (web/computer-assisted telephone interview) versions of the parent, teacher, administrator, and counselor questionnaires; inclusion of a counselor survey to document school course and program assignment policies and procedures; starting point in the fall of ninth grade, the traditional beginning of high school; enhanced emphasis on the dynamics of educational and occupational decisionmaking; enhanced emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and math trajectories; follow-up in spring of 11th grade, including follow-up math assessment; concern with general trends in youth transition, not grade-based specific comparisons with prior spring cohorts of eighth-graders, sophomores, and seniors; extraction of eighth-grade administrative records in selected states; and linkage to selected state administrative data systems and augmentation of selected state public school samples to render them state-representative. At the same time, there are major points of continuity with all or several of the past studies: commitment to collecting high school transcripts as in HS&B, NELS:88, and ELS:2002; nationally representative sample with an oversample of private schools and student numbers that are sufficient for subgroup reporting by major race/ethnicity categories, including Asians; commitment to following the cohort beyond high school; commitment to identifying and following high school dropouts; contextual samples of parents as in HS&B, NELS:88, and ELS:2002; contextual samples of teachers as in HS&B, NELS:88, and ELS:2002; school administrator survey as in HS&B, NELS:88, and ELS:2002; ability-adaptive assessment battery as in NELS:88 and ELS:2002; and like the earlier cohort studies, HSLS:09 will produce a general-purpose dataset that will support a broad range of descriptive and interpretive reporting."}, {"section_title": "Relationship Between Field Test and Main Study", "text": "The purpose of the HSLS:09 field test was to test and revise instruments, forms, and procedures, including items needed to create a two-stage main study longitudinal mathematics assessment; questionnaire content for the main study, across student, parent, administrator, teacher (mathematics and science), and counselor instruments; new approaches to data capture, in particular computer-based tests and questionnaires; school recruitment and data collection methods; and overall study design. In particular, it was important to test new materials and procedures, to reflect the ways in which HSLS:09 may differ from its predecessors. HSLS:09 marks, for the study series, a transition from paper-and-pencil to electronic student questionnaires and tests. It also represents a fall ninth-grade starting point that differs from that of the spring-based 8th-, 10th-, and 12thgrade cohorts of the earlier high school longitudinal studies. HSLS:09's deeper emphasis on understanding choice behaviors and their timing, moreover, must be achieved within reduced student questionnaire time-a 35-minute questionnaire with 30 minutes of substantive and 5 minutes of contact information. Compared with prior studies, HSLS:09 encountered much more severe problems in recruiting schools because schools today feel that they are already overtested and instructional time is correspondingly more limited. This issue pervasively affects the study, from school recruitment to the amount of time given to student tests and questionnaires, and must be viewed as a central constraint that affected the form and content of the field test as a trial run for the main study. The field test was primarily a trial of the main study procedures, methods, and content, but there are important respects in which the field test and main study will differ. One major difference is that the field test included 12th-and 9th-grade students. To select assessment items that are likely to show gain and support the vertical scaling of the tests, it was necessary to assess both 9th-graders and 12th-graders, using the initial mathematics item pool. This doubled the size of the field test sample in each school, which required more computers to administer HSLS:09 in the same time frame, and which posed more challenges in recruiting schools to participate in the field test. The fall 12th-graders are in fact a proxy for the spring-term 11th-graders who will comprise the sample for the HSLS:09 first follow-up in 2012. Another important difference between the field test and the main study is that only the main study sample will be nationally representative. Analyses of the field test data are purely methodological in their character and intent, and the field test data are not suitable for producing population estimates. Consequently, the data have not been edited, composite variables have not been constructed, and sample weights have not been generated-in contrast to what will be done with the main study data that will be released to analysts."}, {"section_title": "Organization of This Report", "text": "Chapter 2 discusses the field test design and sampling procedures, beginning at the school level, then encompassing the sampling of students within schools, and finally, selection of parents and teachers as providers of contextual information on the student. Administrator and counselor data constitute both student contextual data, and data to support school-level analyses. Chapter 2 also discusses the development of a data security plan. Chapter 3 focuses on another aspect of field test preparation-securing the cooperation of schools, often at multiple levels (for example, public school district or Catholic diocese and the specific school) and enlisting in the study all other HSLS:09 respondent populationsstudents, parents, administrators, teachers, and school counselors. The subject of chapter 4 is data collection. It provides information about the recruitment and training of data collection staff, the data collection procedures used in and outside of schools, and the results-in terms of participation rates-of the various field test surveys. Chapter 5 takes as its subject the various student data collections-the mathematics assessment, the student questionnaire, and the collection of student eighth-grade administrative data. The results for the assessment item pool are reported on the basis of both classical and item response theory (IRT) methods. Chapter 6, in contrast, examines and analyzes the data collected in the teacher, school administrator, and counselor surveys. Attention is given to questionnaire experiments, scale reliabilities, closing of open-ended response options, and interview timingtopics that are also examined in the analysis of the student questionnaire. Chapter 7 takes the parent questionnaire data as its focus (including the parent reliability reinterview), while chapter 8 evaluates coding procedures, chapter 9 provides information about the survey control system and data processing, and chapter 10 concisely states conclusions.

To begin the student sampling process, RTI requested from the school representatives at the 41 participating schools an electronic list containing the following information for all enrolled 9thand 12th-grade students: student ID number; full name; sex; race/ethnicity (Hispanic, White, Black, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, American Indian or Alaska Native, other); and whether an Individualized Education Program (IEP) was filed for the student. RTI asked that the electronic file be formatted as either a column-formatted or comma-delimited ASCII file or a Microsoft Excel file to expedite processing of the within-school sampling frames. Additionally, schools were strongly encouraged to upload their lists directly to the HSLS:09 website, and 39 of 41 schools did so. Enrollment lists encrypted using FIPS 140-2 verified encryption software were accepted via e-mail; five schools sent information via e-mail. This process was vetted and approved by the NCES Disclosure Review Board/Data Review Board, and RTI provided schools with instructions to download and use approved encryption software when needed. Even though the enrollment-list protocol was emphasized, RTI accepted from the schools whatever sampling information was available for the students to minimize burden of participation. In general, RTI sampling staff processed the lists within the first 24 hours of receiving the information to ensure no delays in the in-school data collection. Most important, the list processing included a series of quality assurance (QA) checks. Lists that failed the QA checks were reviewed internally with project staff and externally with the school representative. Three checks were of particular importance for sampling: (1) Any school that sent a list of only 9thgraders or only 12th-graders failed the QA checks. (2) Lists that did not include race/ethnicity, the within-school stratification variable, failed the QA checks. (3) RTI also compared the school counts of 9th-and 12th-grade students, overall and by race/ethnicity, against the NCES sampling frame information to verify that the school provided a complete list of eligible students. An absolute difference in the school and frame counts of fewer than 100 students was deemed acceptable. Larger differences-those that exceeded 25 percent of the frame counts-were flagged for additional review. Schools with lists that failed the QA check were recontacted by the school recruiter to resolve the discrepancies. Study protocols were reviewed with the school representative who prepared the student lists to ensure a clear understanding of the study's purpose. For most schools, the representatives either confirmed the correctness of the current list or provided a replacement roster of students. In a small number of cases, the representative was unable to provide additional information such as race/ethnicity; students for these schools were sampled as having a race other than Hispanic, Asian, or Black. (Two schools did not give any race/ethnicity information; one school gave race/ethnicity information for the 9th-graders but not for the 12thgraders, and one school gave race/ethnicity information for the 12th-graders but not the 9thgraders.) RTI randomly selected a stratified systematic sample of approximately 30 9th-graders and 30 12th-graders from each of the 41 participating schools (see table 1) by the four-category race/ethnicity strata within grade. Note that more student participants were requested from the field test schools than will be requested for the main study schools because (a) students from two grades were assessed in the field test in comparison to only ninth-graders in the main study; and (b) lower participation rates among the field test schools resulted in higher student-level sampling rates to achieve sufficient sizes for the analyses. For each school, students were sampled using overall sampling rates specific to their race/ethnicity category to minimize the variation in the student sampling weights, as required for the main study, while attaining the overall desired number of students by race/ethnicity for the analysis task. However, fluctuations in the size of the schools introduced variability in the number of student participants, and in the workload for the schools and project team. Therefore, the sampling rates were adjusted so that no more than 40 students per grade would be selected for the study. This number was set to facilitate the group administration within a single classroom. Additionally, a minimum size of 10 was selected for small schools."}, {"section_title": "Eligibility and Exclusion", "text": "RTI requested information for all 9th-and 12th-grade students enrolled at the school except for foreign-exchange students. Once the sample was selected, students were identified as ineligible for the study if the school determined that they could not participate because of either a language issue or a disability. Students whose native language was not English and whose English language proficiency was limited were deemed eligible to participate in HSLS:09 if either (a) they had received academic instruction primarily in English for at least 3 years, or (b) school administrators determined that the student could meaningfully respond to the questionnaire and to the assessment. For students with an IEP whose mental or physical disabilities constituted a potential barrier to participation, the following guidelines were used: (a) If a student's IEP indicated that the student should not be tested, the student was excused from the HSLS:09 assessment battery. (b) If the student's IEP indicated that the student could be tested with accommodations that were feasible to implement, then the student was included in the HSLS:09 participant pool. The following accommodations were used in prior studies and were made available to the HSLS:09 field test participants: extra time; instruments administered in multiple sessions (split session); instructions in sign language for students with hearing impairments; and one-on-one session (if the student could not participate in group settings). In the field test, 94.2 percent of 9th-graders and 95.2 percent of 12th-graders sampled for the HSLS:09 were classified as eligible. 85 1 The percentage of the expected number is greater than 100 percent when (a) the students within a particular stratum are oversampled, as with Asian and Hispanic students, or (b) the increases in the frame counts are somewhat large.

Schools were asked to provide all three pieces of information within 1 week of receiving the request. The 1-week deadline was too short for most schools to provide this information, with just two schools submitting the list within 8 days. On average, schools needed 30.5 days from the date of receiving the request to prepare parent contact information for sampled students. Parent contact information was received from 35 schools, although one of those schools submitted its lists too close to the end of data collection to be loaded into the system and used.

The 1-week deadline was too short for schools to provide the lists and no school was able to provide the requested teacher and related course information in the timeframe allotted. Teacher lists were received from 39 schools. One school provided a teacher list without linking it to the students, and this school's list could not be used. Schools provided teacher lists in a range of 10 to 83 days from the date of the list request, with an average of 30 days between the date of the list request and receipt of the list. Six of the lists were received too close to the end of data collection to be processed and used for teacher data collection. It was intended that the teacher list would be loaded into the student questionnaire so students could select their teacher from a dropdown box in the questionnaire. Unfortunately, most lists were received too late to be preloaded into the student instrument. Analysis of teacher-student linkages was conducted after data collection concluded. When a teacher list was received it was checked for the following items to determine whether it would pass a quality check: first and last name of teacher; current math or science course; and period of the course.

The list collection process for the field test involved first collecting a student enrollment list, then sampling the students from this initial list, and subsequently requesting a second list containing the parent and teacher information for sample students, as well as eighth-grade administrative data. School staff felt overburdened with multiple list requests, often resulting in major delays in receiving the parent, teacher, and eighth-grade information from schools. These delays had a negative impact on the staff and parent data collections, which had a compressed data collection window and a firm end date. RTI recommends consolidating the list collection for the main study and requesting the parent and teacher information in the initial list. A single list collection would reduce the burden on the school. Schools would still have the option to provide the information separately if they choose to do so. RTI would discard contact, teacher, and course information for any student not selected for the HSLS:09 sample. Other NCES studies, such as the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), have had success collecting parent contact information on a student enrollment list, and HSLS:09 is prepared to follow this model.\nDuring the field test RTI learned that the level of complexity in data collection is such that several changes are recommended to facilitate a more successful administration of the main study: 1. Consolidate the lists collections into a single request of the school. 2. Promote the use of passive parental consent whenever possible. 3. Encourage each school to schedule a pretest day visit to test the computer equipment and review the logistical arrangements. 4. Allow for an assistant to accompany the SA to each session, at each school with 15 or more sampled students. 5. Enlist the support of an IT coordinator at each school to ensure that all technical components of the study are in place and fully functional. 6. Contact staff directly rather than enlisting the support of the SC for staff prompting. Consolidate list collections. Data collection activities commenced with the collection of the student list, from which the students were sampled. The parent list, teacher list, and eighthgrade records were requested after the students were sampled from the original enrollment list. School staff felt overburdened with multiple list requests, often resulting in major delays in receiving the second set of information from schools. These delays had a negative impact on the staff and parent data collections which had a compressed data collection window and a firm end date. In addition, there were numerous issues with the availability, timing, and quality of the eighth-grade administrative records (see section 5.3 for details). For the main study, RTI recommends a single unified list collection. RTI will request a ninth-grade enrollment list with each student's parent contact information and ninth-grade math and science teacher and course information. A single list collection will reduce the burden on the school coordinator. In addition, many field test school coordinators indicated that it would be easier for them to provide the detailed information, up front, for everyone on the roster, than to provide it later for a subset of the students. For the subset of schools that can more easily respond with a totally inclusive list, RTI will accept such augmented lists and will discard contact, teacher, and course information for any student not later selected for the HSLS:09 sample. Encourage passive consent. In an effort to improve student response rates within schools, RTI also needs to encourage as many schools as possible to allow passive consent. RTI's recruitment staff will be trained to explain to schools the four reasons passive consent is preferred: There is no risk to the participants. There is no known physical or psychological risk associated with students completing the assessment and questionnaire. Using implied consent will not affect the rights and welfare of the subjects. We will mail the parental consent forms to parents to ensure that parents are aware of the study and informed that they have the right to remove their child from the study at any time without penalty. Parents will be allowed to refuse their consent even after the teenager has participated by contacting RTI and requesting to have their teenager's information removed from the data file. Using explicit consent in schools requires the use of labor-intensive techniques to obtain written parental consent from each parent. Because school staff would be asked to distribute multiple forms and follow up with parents and students, this increases the burden on school staff. Our goal is to minimize the burden on school staff as much as possible. The potential knowledge from the study is important enough to justify the waiver. HSLS:09 will provide invaluable data to researchers and education policy makers. In-person visits prior to test day. RTI learned that schools that were visited in person prior to test day were better prepared for the session and generally had higher student participation rates than those that were not visited prior to the session. RTI recommends asking schools to schedule a visit prior to the scheduled session to test the computer equipment, review logistics, and, when possible, work with the students to encourage high student participation in the scheduled session. Assistants for session administrators. RTI also learned that setting up the computer equipment takes time and that the RTI-provided equipment can be quite heavy. For other than extremely small schools (<15 students in the session), RTI recommends having an assistant onsite at each session to assist with the computerized administration. An assistant also can help monitor the room when students have a considerable number of questions. Engage an IT coordinator. During the field test, RTI found it invaluable to enlist the support of an IT person onsite at the school to test the computer capabilities and help the session administrator troubleshoot computer problems in the school computer lab on test day. Three of the schools that backed out of the study after initially agreeing to participate did so because of issues with getting the computerized assessment to work in the computer lab. Often, the person designated as the school coordinator is not technically savvy and is unable to troubleshoot technical issues that may be encountered either in the testing of equipment prior to the session or on test day. Based on the field test experience, RTI recommends designating an IT coordinator at each school, in addition to the school coordinator, and offering a small honorarium to the IT coordinator. Many spend time working with RTI programmers, making changes to their computer lab or providing assistance during the session. It was a strong recommendation of the session administrators that IT coordinators be compensated for these efforts. Contact staff directly. Once the student session was completed, RTI found that the school coordinators felt their role had been completed and they were not overly helpful in prompting school staff to complete their questionnaires. For the main study, RTI recommends contacting and prompting staff respondents individually and directly. By collecting parent and staff information earlier, RTI would be able to initiate parent and staff questionnaires earlier. This would enable the session administrators to prompt school staff in person while they are at the school to conduct the student session. It would also allow ample time for follow-up by telephone interviewers, thus improving response rates for the staff and parent questionnaires. The main study data collection for parents and school staff will extend 2 months beyond the student data collection, ending February 11, 2010. These additional 2 months will allow time to effectively work all of the cases, even when parent and staff lists are sent separately from students and are subsequently delayed from schools, resulting in anticipated higher response rates for parents and school staff. Chapter 5.\nBased on the field test results (or, in the case of the textbook question, design considerations), BTMTHCOL and BTSCICOL will be edited, as described above, to prevent any teachers misunderstanding the questions. For BTMTHCRS and BTSCICRS, upper-level course options will be dropped and remaining options, especially in mathematics offerings, will be clarified. Two response options will be added to BTMCLPCT and BTSCLPCT: -materials developed by other teachers\u2016 and -resources from the Internet.\u2016 Finally, for BTMGRPCT, and BTSGRPCT (the percentage of test items from various sources), the recommendation is to add the most frequent responses reported in the open-ended analysis: -were developed by other teachers,\u2016 -come from state/national assessments released items\u2016 and -come from the Internet.\u2016 The current wording of option (b) on both items should be changed to -come from other commercially available materials, including test generators, and test prep materials\u2016; while option (a) on BTSGRPCT is to be changed to -from primary textbook/program, including ancillary materials\u2016 to clarify what the item is requiring.\nThe analyses of responses to the HSLS:09 school administrator survey did not uncover any questions or sub-items that were so problematic and beyond repair as to be summarily deleted from the survey. For the main study, questions must be short, to the point, and include instructions on how to answer. If the questionnaire promises to be only 30 minutes in length, it must be 30 minutes in length or principals will take shortcuts to finish or stop the session before finishing. One analysis that was performed but not discussed was a review of the distribution of responses to assess response variance. Survey items that are part of a hypothesis or conceptual model explaining or predicting an outcome(s) must show response variation, otherwise there is no point in retaining the question or item. Questions or items for which their whole purpose is to describe the nature and scope of schools and their practices and policies are not subject to the same need for wide variation in responding. The review of response distributions (i.e., variance) revealed that responses varied for predictive variables and descriptive variables alike. No questions could be deleted because of a lack of variation. Based on the results of the analyses presented above, the following recommendations are offered for the main study: BATYPA/B-Add a respondent instruction: -Indicate \u2017Yes' or \u2017No' per each characteristic\u2016 if the administrator questionnaire is shortened; otherwise allow -indicate yes/mark all that apply.\u2016 Also, consider winnowing the list to preserve only the most analytically usable of the school types. BARACE-Add the respondent instruction to -Enter 000, if none.\u2016 BA12LAST-Combine response options as in ELS, and add the respondent instruction to -Enter 000, if none.\u2016 BANUMTCH-Delete all part-time teacher items and reduce the list of subjects asked about for full-time teachers as recommended by the HSLS TRP. For the sub-items that remain, add the respondent instruction to -Enter 00, if none.\u2016 BADEGREE-Make the response options consistent with the question wording by combining the separate response options of -minor\u2016 and -second major\u2016 as in ELS:2002. BAGRAD-Same as above or ask for only principals' major graduate degree. BAEXPTCH-Consider adding an automatic, programmed check, that would prompt respondents who fail to enter a valid response for all sub-items to -Enter 0, if none, or a value greater than 0, if teaching experience.\u2016 BAPRTCH-Same as above. BASPENT-Consider shortening the list of activities, but if shortening the list, retain the -other activities\u2016 response option, and add the respondent instruction to -Enter 000, if no time is spent on the activity.\u2016 Additionally, return to the form in which this item has been asked in prior NCES studies, and elicit units of time (hours) instead of percents. In addition to the recommendations above, some additional changes, brought up by the HSLS TRP, should be seriously considered. The HSLS TRP recommended the deletion of various sub-items and whole questions from the school administrator survey and the shifting of additional items to the school counselor survey. Together these approaches should reduce item nonresponse to below 15 percent by shortening the length of the survey and providing instructions on how to respond to the question. See appendix D for a list of TRP members and meeting minutes.\nAfter analyzing the field test results, the changes needed to the counselor survey involve closing the items with open-ended text fields. These recommended changes are described in section 6.3.1 of this report. These changes primarily involve simplifying current wording or adding additional response options to address frequently cited alternatives.\nAnalyses conducted with field test parent survey data suggest the need for a number of changes. To at least moderate potential social desirability biases, parent reports of discussions with their child and reports of making contact with the school, should be expressed in terms of behavioral frequencies, rather than in more subjective terms such as -sometimes\u2016 or -often.\u2016 The IEP item's disability categories reflect the federal classifications, but parents' experience did not always align with these categories (for example, attention deficit disorder is not a federally defined disability, but was regarded as a disability by many parents). An alternative question on disability type may be desirable for the main study questionnaire. Parental monitoring and rules questions showed little variance; for example, 94 percent of parents reported that the family had rules about doing homework. Consideration should be given to whether such items might be dropped because they seem uninformative. Some further modifications are necessary in terms of closing open-ended questions. Finally, although the reliability reinterview found a goodly amount of temporal stability in responses, a number of (in particular) newly written items fell below the 85 percent agreement threshold and should be rewritten (e.g., vague quantifers should be replaced) to improve their reliability if they are to be employed in the full-scale study. Chapter 8.\nThe following improvements will be made for the main study: new monitoring reports for augmented states and reports based on school type, locale, and region; automation of list files downloaded to the SCS from the NCES servers and auto e-mail to appropriate staffs to increase efficiency in list processing; trigger the counselor and administrator survey tasks independent of teacher survey readiness; new tools for field staff to verify that they have all the information for test day; increased automation of mailing process related to survey notification; automation of the preload process for the parent CATI-CMS; and early monitoring of the data collected from surveys and math assessment. Chapter 10."}, {"section_title": "Instrumentation Development: Guiding Principles", "text": "Several general principles were followed in developing the questionnaires. First, the development and review process for each questionnaire consisted of the following steps: 1. Meetings of Experts. Prior to and immediately following contract award, NCES convened meetings of experts on a variety of assessment and instrumentation and study design topics, including computerized assessment and the construction of student interest and decisionmaking inventories that could capture both the internal attributes of students and external influences. These materials were drawn on in instrument development. 2. Technical Review Panel (TRP) Review. The TRP, a specially appointed, independent group of substantive, methodological, and technical experts, reviewed the questionnaires, in a role advisory to the contractor. Two TRP reviews took place before the field test, to evaluate proposed field test content, and one, to examine results, took place after the field test. 3. Questionnaire Revision. The draft survey instruments were revised based on TRP, NCES, and other reviewer comments. 4. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Review. OMB reviewed the instruments and the study design, as a condition of approval for the field test."}, {"section_title": "Field Testing and Revision", "text": ". The instruments were field tested and revised based on field test results. A second OMB review will occur post-field test. Second, a number of content and design considerations influenced the development process. These considerations include the following: severe time and burden constraints; need to balance breadth of coverage with more intensive focus on STEM issues; need to work within a longitudinal design; opportunity to employ some number of new constructs and items; desirability of adhering to a larger theoretical framework; stress on student as the primary unit of analysis; need to cognitively pretest new items; need to ensure articulation across the different questionnaires; administrative records and external data should be used to limit respondent burden; and desirability of experimenting with a large student questionnaire item pool in the field test. Each of these content and design issues merits further discussion. Time constraints. The number of questionnaire and test items that could be asked was severely limited. All questionnaires (student, parent, teacher, administrator, counselor) and the test were limited to about 30 minutes in length. This constraint affected both the number of items that could be asked and the formats of items (for example, using multiple choice rather than constructed response test items, use of -mark all that apply\u2016 [rather than yes/no] survey formats). Breadth of coverage and content focus. HSLS:09 will be a general-purpose dataset. It is designed to serve a broad constituency and to fulfill a variety of needs, but will place special stress on STEM antecedents and outcomes. An important aspect of the instrument development process was therefore balancing depth and breadth of topical coverage. Longitudinal design. The primary research objectives of HSLS:09 are longitudinal in nature-cross-sectional findings (including time series data across cohorts) will have value, but the design must give priority to longitudinal research. The baseline antecedents to be collected should in large measure be determined by the ultimate outcomes that will be measured in later rounds. New constructs. Precise cross-cohort comparisons with prior studies are a low priority: HSLS:09 will not give overriding priority to the goal of maximizing comparability with the itemlevel content of the earlier studies (NLS-72, HS&B, NELS:88, ELS:2002). The study will collect data at new time points as defined by student's grade, and seeks to ask new questions. Nonetheless, it will capture the general transition out of high school in a largely comparable way. Theoretic framework. The starting point for sources of constructs to be measured was a general framework for the student survey (figure 2). From this framework broad research domains were identified as relevant, and from each domain, key constructs were drawn. Items to measure the constructs were subsequently sought as well. For example, student background/ demographic characteristics is a research domain, nested in it is the construct of English language status, which in turn is tapped by specific items (e.g., items asking about whether a language other than English is spoken in the home)."}, {"section_title": "Unit of analysis.", "text": "The individual student is the fundamental analytic unit for HSLS:09, although the base year will also provide a representative sample of schools, that can also be reexamined 3 years later, in pursuit of school effects on learning over the first 3 years of high school. In general, the nonstudent components-parent, school administrator, teacher, and school counselor-provide data for understanding students in their school and social context.  Item selection and new items. Preference was given to items with known measurement properties, especially those used in large-scale national surveys, particularly NCES studies. However, where items were dictated by the framework or key constructs that were unavailable from national studies, items were taken from smaller, more local studies, and in a few instances, it was necessary to write new items. For new items, the evaluation process involved, first, cognitive interviews, and second, the field test to which all HSLS:09 candidate items were subjected. Articulation between data sources. Articulation between the various questionnaires is a key issue for HSLS:09. First, some redundancy across contents is desirable to permit analyses of item validities, perceptual differences, etc.-in the tradition of -triangulation.\u2016 Second, redundancy should be minimized to limit burden and permit more topics to be explored-for any given item, the best source should be identified. In some instances, one may have to wait for the best source (e.g., archival transcripts of coursetaking and grades are of higher quality than student self-reports, but will not be collected until fall 2013). Use of ancillary data. Burden to respondents can be minimized and a broad ecological perspective achieved by merging in records from available sources such as academic transcripts, state administrative data systems, and later to student loan records, SAT and ACT scores, and postsecondary transcripts. High school transcripts will help fill gaps and achieve cross-wave articulation by providing term-by-term continuous information for grades 9-12. While most of these are future measures, the 2008 field test did attempt to obtain eighth-grade course and grades records from high schools, and the main study will include several state supplements that will link HSLS:09 data and state longitudinal records. But eighth-grade records often proved difficult to collect from the field test schools, and the data collected were sometimes of questionable utility (see section 5.3 for details). Testing a large pool of student survey items. Field test sample sizes were driven by item response theory (IRT) requirements for analysis of the assessment item pool. Given, therefore, the comparatively large sample sizes (more than a thousand ninth-graders), some matrix sampling of questionnaire items was possible to increase the number of items that could be evaluated. This opportunity was utilized in the field test so that many more student survey items, and in particular scales whose reliability could be assessed, could be tested, than could have been included in a single main study version of the questionnaire. In addition, split-sample experiments were identified and embedded in the questionnaire (to allow different versions of Likert scales, certain gender items, and time estimation items)."}, {"section_title": "Developing the Data Security Plan", "text": "HSLS:09 has been designated moderate risk according to Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) as set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

The PII collected on HSLS:09 includes names of sampled schools, names of sample members within schools, contacting information for sample members, and questionnaire response data. RTI developed a data security plan to document the procedures to be used to secure PII on HSLS:09.

Two of the public schools were determined to be ineligible (one school was a temporary school for juvenile offenders and another did not have ninth-grade students).

This ensured that sufficient response was achieved to conduct item performance analyses by IRT methods on all of the assessment items."}, {"section_title": "School Responses to Incentives and Burden", "text": "An incentive experiment was conducted at the school level for the field test to help offset some of the challenges associated with obtaining school cooperation. The field test experiment compared the effect of a $500 technology allowance against no incentive. The technology allowance was in the form of a check written to the school to be used at the school's discretion, although HSLS:09 field staff recommended that it be used toward technology for the school to align with the focus of the study. RTI determined that the technology allowance did not have an impact on the schools' decisionmaking process. Some school staff reported that the $500 allowance did not offset their concerns about available time, other high-stakes assessments, and meeting AYPs. Anecdotally, based on several refusal conversion contacts, it can be said that some schools reported that the allowance was simply too small, while others reported that no amount of money would suffice. Of the 41 participating sample field test schools, 20 were offered the $500 technology allowance and 21 were not offered the technology allowance. The equal distribution of schools receiving and not receiving the technology allowance leads to the conclusion that this was not an effective tool in gaining cooperation. In addition, a student incentive of $10 was offered to participating students. The student incentive was paid in cash to the student upon completion of the questionnaire, although a $10 gift card to Barnes & Noble was offered to students in schools that did not permit the distribution of cash to students. Barnes & Noble was selected because it is an educational vendor with numerous stores across the country and an online shopping option. Fifteen schools allowed their students to receive the cash incentive and 21 schools allowed the provision of gift cards. Another six schools required that we donate the money to a school fund such as a class trip or student council. The remaining six requested a custom option for the student incentive. The most common objections voiced during the recruitment process were concern about lack of time to devote to HSLS:09, overtesting of students, and not meeting AYPs. Six schools refused to provide a reason for not participating, other than to say -we are not doing this.\u2016 While attempting to address district and school concerns, RTI emphasized that the school coordinator and the session administrator would coordinate the majority of the logistics for the session so that a minimum amount of time would be required of school staff. RTI offered a tiered school coordinator honorarium based on student response rates, a procedure that was successfully used in ELS:2002 and NELS:88. The procedure provides higher honoraria for higher response rates. RTI also offered flexibility in scheduling to the schools. The field test was conducted from September through the middle of December so schools could choose a date that was most convenient for their schedules."}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for the Main Study", "text": "To reach target response rates, it is clear that RTI must be able to recruit a higher percentage of sampled schools to participate in the main study. RTI's main recommendations for school recruitment are commencing school recruitment a year prior to the scheduled data collection, addressing district/school concerns, and increasing the schools' perceived benefits for participation. The recruitment period for the HSLS:09 field test was particularly compressed given the complexities of the study. School recruitment for the field test began in March 2008. RTI recommends commencing the main study recruitment efforts about 1 year prior to the start of data collection to help schools find room for the study on their calendars. During the field test recruitment period, many schools asked about the direct benefit to the school district or school. In response to this inquiry, RTI recommends providing school-level test results to main study schools. Because of the nature of the field test, we were unable to provide school-specific results. There were eight districts and five schools whose participation hinged on the receipt of school-specific results. These school districts and schools participated but explicitly requested that they receive a copy of the First Look report, which will be available in late 2010. As a mechanism for protecting student confidentiality, school-level results would be provided in aggregate form and only to schools that achieve a high student participation rate within the school. School-level test results also would offer a tangible response to schools' concerns about the benefits of their participation. Although it is appealing to provide school-level estimates that would be representative of all ninth-graders in a given school, further analysis shows that school-level representative results would not be very precise in the majority of the schools because of minimum participating sample size requirements: If we assume that the sample within a school is composed of independent observations, alpha = .05 (2-tailed test), power = .80, and the minimum detectable effect size equal to .50, then the required minimum sample size to report school results is n = 32. If we change the alpha criterion to alpha = .10 (2-tailed test) then the required minimum sample size per school is n = 26. Our average expected sample size within school is 25, which falls below either threshold although it approaches the more liberal requirement. It is quite feasible, though, to provide reports to schools that would represent the participating students at the given school. Even though the results would not represent all students in the grade, results would provide interesting information to schools that would be a help in convincing some additional schools and school districts to agree to participate in the study. An alternative plan for delivering data to schools would be to deliver weighted schoollevel test estimates only, with confidence intervals for the estimates, and extensive caveats concerning the limits of generalizability and precision. Essentially, this is the strategy used successfully in ELS:2002. In employing this strategy in HSLS:09, we could make the following stipulations: if schools have a participating sample of some minimum (to be determined in simulations from ELS:2002 data, but provisionally set at 25) and a minimum response rate (85 percent unweighted), the schools could receive a report with 3 data points (assessment mean above, at, or below national averages), weighted results, along with confidence intervals and explanation of data limits. With the increase of high-stakes testing, many public schools communicated a reluctance to have students lose any more instructional time for the study. Some also voiced concern that the students were being overtested. It is important that RTI continue to communicate willingness to schedule test days to fit the schools' schedules and times that minimize the loss of instructional time. With an increased time frame to recruit schools and schedule test dates, RTI will have more flexibility to schedule test days earlier in the semester when schools tend to be less overtaxed. RTI will empathize with schools and communicate to schools that NCES took steps to avoid having schools be selected for multiple NCES studies being conducted in the same school year (PISA:09, NAEP:10). Schools will be informed that, unlike other types of testing, the HSLS:09 study requires no advance preparation of students. This limits their lost instructional time to just 90 minutes on test day. RTI would also offer accommodations to minimize loss of instructional time, such as breaking the 90-minute session into two 45-minute sessions or conducting a student session after school hours. RTI further recommends that, in limited cases, RTI offers to drop study components if this is an obstacle to participation. Catholic and other private schools had more concerns about being too understaffed to take on the survey. RTI will be in a position to send staff to schools to assist with activities such as the preparation of enrollment lists. Other concerns of private schools included a mistrust of the government and difficulty in understanding how they would benefit from the study. The provision of school-level results will address the question of benefit, assuming that the school produces a large enough sample for results to be provided. In addition, RTI will emphasize the need for information from private schools for the study to be representative of all types of schools. It is crucial to the response rate that as many schools as possible be encouraged to allow passive parental consent. The field test clearly demonstrated that active consent is more laborintensive and results in a lower student response rate. To encourage schools to allow passive consent, RTI will reiterate the high standards of confidentiality and the strict data security procedures for HSLS:09. \nIn addition to dropping scales that did not meet minimum reliability levels, and items within scales that made only marginal, or negative, contributions to overall reliabilities, it is recommended that the embedded experiments be used to determine the issue of best format for asking about time use, and whether the middle position should be used in Likert scales. In terms of the time use recommendations, the running total on the entry screen did not seem (although with certain minor qualifications at the subgroup level) to support statistically significant differences in estimation, but did have the undesirable characteristic of increasing completion time. In light of this, it is not recommended that the running total form be used, although concern about the cognitively taxing nature of open-ended time estimation across a wide array of activities does seem to suggest the prudence of switching from an open continuous format to a categorical format-an approach consonant with time use items on the prior high school cohort studies, except for the ELS:2002 base year. In terms of the Likert scale choice of whether to include or exclude a middle position, conclusively strong evidence was not uncovered, such that this issue could be settled definitively. However, the 4-point scale is recommended for three reasons: it was not associated with higher item nonresponse (as might be expected, if students were frustrated by the absence of a neutral value in the middle of the scale); it took longer to complete each scale in a 5-point format; and finally, the 4-point scale has been used successfully in the prior studies (not always used in NLS-72, but consistently used in HS&B, NELS:88, and ELS:2002)."}, {"section_title": "Telephone Interviewers and Help Desk Staff", "text": "Parent interview help desk agents. In September 2008, RTI trained 10 telephone interviewers (TIs) to staff the parent interview help desk and to conduct computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) with parents who did not complete the web-based interview. Two of these interviewers were bilingual interviewers who were also able to conduct interviews in Spanish. All of the interviewers had worked previously on National Center for Education Statistics studies at the RTI Call Center. The interviewers were scheduled to work either the day shift or night and weekend shifts. Eight of the interviewers were scheduled for the night and weekend shifts because of an anticipated greater likelihood that parents could be contacted during these times. TIs were trained over three evenings for a total of 12 hours. The agenda for TI training is displayed in figure 6. In addition to learning about their specific roles on the High School Longitudinal Study, they received an overview of the entire project, the implications of the increased security requirements, and answers to frequently asked questions. The interviewers spent a significant portion of the training sessions becoming familiar with the parent questionnaire and learning how to conduct the interview. Additionally, telephone interviewers were trained to use a help desk application, which was a web-based application that allowed interviewers to log all incoming contacts from sample members which did not result in an interview, such as questions about the study, password/ID requests, and problems completing the self-administered interview. Prior to their first shift, interviewers were paired with a Quality Control Supervisor to conduct a mock interview to determine whether they were ready to begin working on HSLS:09. testing had been completed and to ask the SCs to remind nonresponding school staff members to complete their interview. After the initial verification call, ICs continued to prompt school staff members as needed. Initial prompting contacts were conducted through the SC. However, SCs were somewhat unreceptive and often tardy in prompting on our behalf while IC prompts, in contrast, were timely and effective. Second, ICs were trained to help school staff members troubleshoot and resolve problems that prevented them from completing their interview. The ICs were trained to use a help desk application within the Institutional Contacting System that allowed them to track all contacts with school staff members. The help desk also served as a gateway to the informed consent text and to each sample member's instrument. This allowed help desk agents to quickly obtain informed consent over the phone and conduct the interview by phone upon request of the sample member. During the training, ICs were instructed on resolving many of the common problems RTI has seen while conducting other web-based studies. Finally, ICs were trained to administer interviews when requested by staff members. In addition to receiving overviews for each of the three instruments, ICs learned CATI -best practices\u2016 such as administering informed consent, using active listening techniques, probing, and maintaining neutrality. At the end of the training each IC was certified on each of the three instruments. The training agenda for the third day of the IC training can be found in figure 7. or passive (implicit) consent in which a form is only returned if the student is not permitted to participate. Schools were encouraged to use the passive consent form when possible because it presents a lesser burden for the school and results in higher student participation rates. Sixteen of the field test schools (39 percent) required active parental consent. This percentage is considerably higher than in years past."}, {"section_title": "Active Consent", "text": "For schools that required active parental consent, RTI sent information packets to the school for the coordinator to distribute to sampled students. Each packet contained a letter about the study, a consent form, a brochure about the study, a flyer to inform the parent and student about the $10 incentive, and an envelope bearing the school coordinator's name so parents could return the consent form approving or refusing permission for their child to participate. The packets were sent 4 weeks prior to each school's scheduled test day when lists were received in time. If list receipt was delayed, consent packets were sent within 24 hours of list collection. It was planned that parent contact information would be supplied to session administrators to be used for calling parents to encourage the return of consent forms. Delays in receiving the parent contact information from schools made it not possible to get the information to session administrators in advance of the session for the majority of schools. Prior to test day, the session administrators checked with the coordinators to obtain the names of parents who had not yet sent back a consent form. If they were given telephone numbers, the session administrators telephoned the parents to prompt them to return the forms and answer questions about the study. Very few parents returned forms expressing their refusal to let the student take part. However, many parents did not return the form at all. As a result, only 347 of the 515 eligible ninth-grade students (67.4 percent) sampled at schools requiring active permission took part in the study. At the 12th-grade level, the participation rate was even poorer. Only 304 of the 530 eligible students (57.4 percent) participated."}, {"section_title": "Passive Consent", "text": "For schools that allowed passive parental consent, RTI sent the parental packets to the school for the coordinator to distribute.

Session administrators contacted the school coordinators prior to test day to determine whether any parents had sent back forms that refused consent. For those parents, the session administrators attempted refusal conversion if the school was willing to provide telephone numbers. As with the active consent schools, very few parents returned forms expressing refusal to let their students take part in the study. As a result, 688 of the 761 eligible 9th-grade students (90.4 percent) and 642 of the 761 eligible 12th-grade students (84.4 percent) from passive consent schools participated in the study."}, {"section_title": "Finalizing the Data Collection Logistics", "text": "The school recruitment team arranged all of the session logistics prior to transferring the school to the session administrator. The session administrator began contacting the school coordinator within 48 hours of the school receiving its package containing the parental consent forms. This typically occurred about 3 weeks prior to the scheduled student session. At that time, the session administrator contacted the school coordinator to confirm that the consent materials had been distributed, answer questions that the school coordinator may have, and confirm the logistical arrangements agreed on by the school. Cooperation levels of school coordinators varied greatly. Where there were concerns about preparations in advance of the student session, the session administrator arranged for an inperson visit to the school in advance of the session. An in-person visit was attempted when the session administrator experienced difficulty in reaching or working with the SC, when the school requested that the session administrator assist with presession activities, or when overnight travel was required to get to the school. Pretest day visits were conducted in 11 schools. During the visit, the SA would check on the status of parental consent forms, distribute additional forms and reminders as needed, meet with the sampled students if possible to encourage participation, and test the computer equipment in preparation for the session. Each of the session administrators who conducted at least one presession visit to a school reported that the student sessions seemed to proceed more smoothly after a visit had taken place, compared with schools that were not visited in person in advance of the student session. Prior to the student session, the session administrator worked with the school coordinator to determine the eligibility of the students sampled to participate in the study. Student eligibility criteria are discussed in section 2.1.3.3. Some students were eligible to participate but had Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) which require that they receive particular accommodations. When accommodations were necessary, RTI made every effort to comply. In the field test, the only accommodation required was to provide extra time on the assessment. However, none of the students who required the extra time as part of their IEP needed or used the extra time in practice. As a result, no accommodations were made for students during the administration of the HSLS:09 field test."}, {"section_title": "Mode of Testing for Student Sessions", "text": "Of particular importance was the mode of testing. HSLS:09 includes a computerized assessment of students conducted on school computers when possible. When school computers were not compatible with RTI's computerized assessment, RTI-provided laptops were used in their place. When school computers were compatible and a computer lab at the school was available, RTI used a custom Linux distribution called Sojourn to launch the survey and math assessment software. Using Sojourn allows for a high degree of interoperability with hardware based on i486 compatible processors, creates a controlled testing environment, and secures the computer against key loggers, viruses, or other malicious code. This ensures that any sensitive information entered by the student is not compromised. Prior to conducting the session at a school, a test copy of Sojourn was sent to the school coordinator, who was asked to test the CD in a computer in the school's computer lab that would be used for the student session. School coordinators enlisted the assistance of an IT person at the school who spent considerable time and effort to ensure that the Sojourn CD was operational in the school and that the computers were set up in time for the students' arrival on test day. This proved to be a critical role in the field test, because ensuring the compatibility of the equipment with the Sojourn bootable CD prior to test day was fundamentally crucial to the success of the in-school sessions. When it was not possible to use school computers, either because school computer systems were incompatible or because facilities were unavailable at the school, some schools used RTI-provided laptops to administer the session. Each session administrator brought five laptop computers to the school, resulting in the need for multiple small group sessions to administer the session to each sampled student. As discussed in section 2.1.3, larger numbers of students were sampled at each school for the field test than is planned for the main study. As a result, some schools did not have enough computers in the computer lab to allow all sampled students in a given grade to participate in the same session. In addition, more time was taken in the schools for the field test than will be realized for the main study because an average of 30 students from each of two grades (9th and 12th) participated in the field test while 9th-grade students will be the sole participants in the main study. To minimize the number of sessions required and the amount of time spent in each school, the session administrator used the laptop computers to supplement the school computers when needed. This maximized the number of students who could take part in a session simultaneously. The distribution of schools by test mode is shown in table 5. Thirty-six schools successfully used Sojourn in the school's computer labs for the administration of the student session. Of those 36 schools, 25 used a combination of school computers and laptops to accommodate more students in each session. Five schools were unable or unwilling to use Sojourn and conducted small group sessions on laptop computers provided by RTI. "}, {"section_title": "Conducting the Student Session", "text": "On the test day, session administrators checked in at the school, proceeded to the session location, set up for the session, and confirmed the status of parental consent forms before the students arrived for the session. As students arrived at the session, the session administrator took attendance and distributed login credentials for accessing the electronic questionnaire and assessment. Students also received a pencil and scratch paper. In specific situations, session administrators were authorized to bring an assistant to the school. Situations that warranted an assistant included schools that required multiple sessions to be conducted simultaneously in different rooms, assistance required with the setup and supervision of computers, or a school mandate that school personnel were not to work on outside studies. An assistant was particularly paramount to helping to set up the school computer labs with Sojourn in time for the student session. The recruitment team attempted to schedule the computer lab starting 30 minutes prior to the start of the session. Loading Sojourn on each computer was a time-consuming process that required at least two people to ensure that the start time of the student session was not delayed. An assistant was also available to help monitor the classroom during the session, especially while the session administrator was answering student questions about the computerized questionnaire and assessment. Assistants were also charged with helping to locate students who did not show up for the scheduled session and encourage them to report to the computer lab for the session. Once all the students had arrived, the SA would read a script (see appendix E) to all the students, which prompted students to log in and begin the test. There were two parts to the session: the background questionnaire and the math assessment. For the ninth-graders the background questionnaire was timed to take a maximum of 35 minutes. Twelfth-graders, who would not be followed longitudinally, were asked for their race, ethnicity, and sex before launching into the mathematics assessment. The mathematics assessment was timed at 40 minutes for both 9th-and 12th-graders. At the end of the session, both the 9th-and 12th-graders received a $10 incentive for their participation. Make-up sessions were conducted if needed to ensure the highest response rates. Two of the 41 schools in the field test preferred not to forfeit additional instructional time and in consequence had no make-up day. Make-up sessions were conducted following the same procedures as were used for the initial session. Session administrators recorded student participation information into the Case Management System on their laptop computer. Participation information was compared against data received from students at the school and discrepancies were resolved as appropriate. Once all student data were collected at the school and data discrepancies were resolved, the school was reassigned to the recruiter to begin the verification process. Verification interviews were conducted by the recruitment team. Recruiters asked the school coordinator a series of questions to determine how the session went from the school's perspective and to resolve any outstanding issues. During the verification interview, the recruiters confirmed that data collection took place on its scheduled date; ensured that SAs behaved professionally in their dealings with both school administrators and students; confirmed that the coordinator was paid the honorarium; confirmed that the students received their incentives; and responded to any questions or concerns that the school coordinator had. Of the 41 schools, 35 participated in verification interviews. Four schools were prompted for verification interviews but the recruiters were not able to contact the appropriate person before the end of the field test period. An additional two schools were never contacted because they completed sessions late in the data collection cycle."}, {"section_title": "Student Response Rates and Other Results", "text": "RTI collected data (background questionnaires, mathematics assessments, or both) from a total of 1,981 9th-and 12th-grade students from 41 high schools in 5 states: California, Florida, Illinois, New York, and Texas. From the ninth-grade sample, RTI collected 1,035 background questionnaires and 1,026 mathematics assessments (81.1 percent of eligible students sampled). From the 12th-grade sample, RTI collected 946 mathematics assessments (73.3 percent). Twelfth-grade participants only completed the math assessment, not the questionnaire, because RTI will not follow up with 12th-grade students in the 2011 follow-up. Overall, participation rates were 81.1 percent for 9th-grade students and 73.3 percent for 12th-grade students. In addition to the primary 41 schools, RTI collected only mathematics assessment data from 11 supplemental schools. Supplemental data were collected to further validate the math assessment items. Table 6 gives a breakout of the number of completes based on primary and supplemental data collections. RTI offered a $10 incentive (cash or a Barnes & Noble gift card) to all students for their participation, subject to the approval of the school. Most schools allowed students to receive the cash or gift cards. Others, however, preferred that the incentive be given directly to the school at the end of data collection. Table 7 shows the number of completes, based on student incentives. Of the 41 schools, 15 (36.6 percent) required active consent and 26 (63.4 percent) required passive consent. The average participation was 59.6 percent for active consent schools and 81.3 percent for passive consent schools.

Included in each mailing was the promise to pay the teacher a base incentive of $25. If a teacher reported on more than one class, that teacher was paid an additional $5 for each class reported in the interview.

Delays in receiving the parent lists and test days late in the data collection period resulted in low response rates from parents. Parent data collection will be extended 2 months beyond the student data collection in the main study, allowing for time to achieve higher parent response rates. Because the field test's large sample sizes are driven by IRT assessment needs, and a yield of 400-500 was deemed adequate for purposes of analyzing parent data in the field test, it would not have been a useful investment to pursue more parent cases. Parents received a letter informing them that their ninth-grader had been selected to participate in HSLS:09 and that their participation would also be needed. Parents were invited to complete a self-administered web survey. Interviewers began calling sample members 10 days after the initial mailing was sent to initiate a telephone interview. Out of the 1,290 eligible parents, 656 (50.9 percent) completed an interview. As with staff data collection, parent data collection ended on December 19, 2009, just 2 days after the last school's data collection was conducted. Parent response rates by student response status is shown in table 10 and parent response rate by contact information loaded is shown in table 11. Again, the comparatively low parent response rate reflects the decision to not expend money collecting more cases, when a sufficient analytic sample had been achieved. As such, the parent response rate in the field test should not be reflective of the likely response rate in the main study. Also, note that for the purpose of the field test, parent data were included regardless of whether a student participated. For the main study, parent participation will only count if a student questionnaire is also completed.  Some households were not located at the telephone number which had been provided by their ninth-grader's school or by the student. These cases were first sent to Accurint. 6 Cases that did not yield new contacting information for the household were then sent to RTI's intensive tracing. Seventy parents who completed an interview were also randomly selected to participate in a quality control reinterview. The reinterview included a small subset of substantive questions from the main interview and took approximately 5 minutes to complete. Of the 70 parents selected, 54 (77.1 percent) completed the reinterview."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Student Survey Results:", "text": "Tests, Questionnaires, Records"}, {"section_title": "Mathematics Assessment", "text": "There are important similarities and differences between the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09) assessment component and the assessments used in the prior studies in the series (National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 , High School and Beyond [HS&B], National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988[NELS:88], and Education Longitudinal Study of 2002[ELS:2002). All the assessments seek to be predictive of future outcomes. In addition, from HS&B forward an additional objective of the various assessments has been to measure achievement growth over time-specifically, gains in knowledge and skills over some span of the high school years. To minimize floor and ceiling effects which threaten to distort gain measurement, adaptive procedures have been built into the tests, starting with NELS:88, and including a two-stage testing strategy in ELS:2002 that has also been adopted for HSLS:09. The HSLS:09 assessment, however, differs from the prior test batteries in several critical respects. First, it is a computerized test. All the former assessments were in paper-and-pencil form. Second, its focus is narrower. Prior test batteries have tested in two to six areas or subjects. HSLS:09 tests only in mathematics, and within mathematics, it provides a focus solely on algebraic reasoning, a critical K-12 strand of the mathematics curriculum. Third, HSLS:09 does not share with the prior studies the objective of supplying a common scale with prior cohorts for purposes of inter-cohort comparison. No attempt is made to link via an equated score because of the comparatively narrower HSLS:09 content framework favoring algebraic reasoning and difference in testing times (spring 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-grade cohorts have been tested in prior studies; HSLS:09 will test in fall of 9th grade and spring of 11th grade). Two additional differences should be noted: while the prior studies borrow heavily from National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), nearly all of the HSLS:09 items are newly written specifically for the study; and while the prior studies vertically scaled across a 2-year span, HSLS:09 must bridge a span of about 3 academic years.\n"}, {"section_title": "Specifications and Development of Test Items and Field Test Forms", "text": "The item development process began with the development of a set of test and item specifications (see appendix F) that described the importance of algebra and defined the domain of algebraic reasoning for the Mathematics Assessment of the HSLS:09. This task entailed internal AIR individual review and revision of each item to ensure alignment, clarity, appropriateness of distracters, and rationales for each distractor; editorial review to ensure accuracy, clarity, and grammatical correctness; senior content review to ensure that each item met all specifications; and Math Advisory Panel review to ensure that each item was properly aligned and of high quality. After all necessary and recommended revisions were made, the entire pool was reviewed one final time by Steve Leinwand at AIR, by John Dossey, and by project staff at RTI. The outcome of this development, review, and revision process was a field test pool of 266 items, of which 264 unique items were selected to populate the field test forms. Of the 266 items, 234 were -new\u2016 items (106 developed by John Dossey and 128 developed by AIR) and 32 were released NAEP items selected to fill remaining gaps particularly for low-complexity items. It was decided to create new items after a review of existing released item pools (e.g., NAEP and Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study) were deemed inadequate in size or composition to meet the demands of HSLS:09. As seen in figure 8, on the field test, each student was given 40 items. Each ninth-grader was assigned one of Forms A, B, C, or D consisting of 14 High items (that are also linked to forms E, F, G, and H); 13 Moderate items; and 13 Low items. Total items = 14 + 13 + 13 = 40. Each 12th-grader was assigned one of Forms E, F, G, or H consisting of 14 Low items (that are also linked to forms A, B, C, and D); 18 Moderate items; and 8 High items. Total items = 14 + 18 + 8 = 40.   The entire set of 264 unique field test items consisted of 32 Grade 11 high-complexity items; 72 Grade 11 moderate-complexity items; 56 Grade 11 low-/Grade 9 high-complexity items; 52 Grade 9 moderate-complexity items; and 52 Grade 9 low-complexity items. Finally, to maximize student access to the items, each of the eight linked forms was cloned by reversing the order of the first half and second half of the items within the second and third block of items that consisted of each of the eight forms to ensure that there were sufficient responses to all items. Figure 9 shows the number of students who took each block of the field test. There were 332 to 351 students per form and no fewer than 310 students per unique item and 669 students for each linking item.

Accordingly, both classical and item response theory (IRT) statistical analyses were conducted on the field test student response data. Classical test theory postulates that a test score can be decomposed into two parts-a true score and an error component; that the error component is random with a mean of zero and is uncorrelated with true scores; and that observed scores are linearly related to true scores and error components. IRT postulates that the probability of correct responses to a set of questions is a function of true proficiency and of one or more parameters specific to each test question."}, {"section_title": "Classical Item Analysis", "text": "To provide information about the quality of the items, traditional item statistics were calculated for each of the items by form. Item statistics include p-value, the proportion of students who obtained a correct answer to the item; adjusted item-test biserial correlations, correlation coefficient between the item score and the total test score with the item in question deleted; omit rate, the proportion of students with omitted (skipped) responses; proportion of students who selected each of the non-key options (distractors); adjusted biserial correlations for the distracters; and Differential Item Functioning (DIF) statistics. DIF analyses were conducted to detect potential item bias across major racial/ethnic and gender groups. In DIF analyses, the performance on each item by subgroup members (black students, Hispanic students, and female students) was compared with the performance of the appropriate reference group (white students or male students), resulting in three sets of comparisons: black/white, Hispanic/white, and female/male. The purpose of these analyses was to identify items that may favor students in one group over those of similar ability in another. The DIF analyses of the field test items were based on the Mantel-Haenszel chi-square procedure (Mantel and Haenszel 1959). The procedure tests the statistical hypothesis that the odds of correctly answering an item are the same for two groups of students with similar ability. For each item, an estimate of the Mantel-Haenszel common odds ratio, expressed as \u0394MH, was produced. Positive values indicate items that are differentially easier for the focal group than the reference group after making an adjustment for the overall level of proficiency in the two groups. Similarly, negative values indicate items that are differentially harder for the focal group than the reference group. It is common practice to categorize each item into one of three categories: -A\u2016 (items exhibiting no DIF), -B\u2016 (items exhibiting a weak indication of DIF), and -C\u2016 (items exhibiting a strong indication of DIF). Items in category -A\u2016 have Mantel-Haenszel common odds ratios that do not differ significantly from 0 at the alpha = .05 level or less than 1.0 in absolute value. Category -C\u2016 items are those with Mantel-Haenszel values that are significantly greater than 1 and larger than 1.5 in absolute magnitude. Other items are categorized as -B\u2016 items. In RTI's analyses, items in the -C\u2016 category were flagged for additional fairness and sensitivity reviews. Table 16 presents a summary of the p-value, adjusted biserial correlations, and omit rate for all students, 9th-grade students and 12th-grade students respectively. The mean percent correct for the item pool was 43 percent with a range of 11 percent correct on the most difficult item and 84 percent correct on the easiest item. The p-value, adjusted biserial correlations, omit rate, and DIF statistics for each of the field test items are presented in appendix G. Based on the item statistics described above, items were flagged for review for the following reasons: p-value is less than .25 or greater than .95. Adjusted biserial correlation statistic is less than .10. Adjusted biserial correlations for distractors are greater than .05. Omit rate is greater than .15. The item falls into the C category for any DIF contrast. The C category indicates evidence of significant DIF and is defined as MH\u03c7 2 is significant and | \u0394\u02c6 | MH \u2265 1.5. Table 17 shows the number of items that were flagged on the basis of each of the flagging criteria. Given items with multiple flags, a total of 68 unique items received one or more flags. Flagged items were first reviewed to ensure that the data were accurate, properly analyzed, had correct response keys, and had no obvious problems with the items. The items were further reviewed for content appropriateness and then for fairness and sensitivity reviews on the basis of DIF statistics."}, {"section_title": "Item Response Theory Scaling", "text": "Prior to the scaling procedures, the student response data were scored as follows: \uf0b7 The correct key for the item were considered Right. \uf0b7 Nonresponses that were followed by valid responses to other items in the test were considered Omitted. Items scored as Omitted were treated as though they were Wrong. \uf0b7 Nonresponses that occurred after the last item in the test with a valid response were considered Not Reached. Items scored as Not Reached were treated as though they had never been presented to the respondent. This was done so as not to underestimate the proficiency of respondents who did not complete an entire test. The three-parameter logistic (3PL) model from item response theory (Hambleton and Swaminathan 1985) was used to estimate item parameters for the HSLS:09 field test. The 3PL model is a mathematical model for estimating the probability that a person will respond correctly to an item. This probability is given as a function of a parameter characterizing the proficiency of a given person, and three parameters characterizing the properties of a given item. The model is as follows: is the locator parameter of item i, characterizing its difficulty; and i c is the lower asymptote parameter of item i, reflecting non-zero chances of correct response by guessing. To place all items from the grades 9 and 12 tests on a single vertical scale, a joint calibration of all items was conducted using the AM (Cohen et al. 2000) software. The AM software produces IRT item parameters and uses maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) procedures to estimate examinee proficiency on the theta scale. In the joint calibration, grade 9 was used as the base grade, and separate, normal population distributions for each grade level were estimated so that achievement differences at the grade levels were clear in the item parameters and examinee proficiency means. Table 18 shows the mean, minimum, and maximum values for each of the three IRT parameters for all students, 9th-grade students, and 12th-grade students, respectively.  Table 19 shows the mean and variance of theta for grades 9 and 12 and reveals that, appropriately, the mean proficiency of grade 12 students was approximately one standard deviation higher than that of grade 9 students. Table 19. Descriptive statistics for theta: Observed scores using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), grades 9 and 12 Model fit for each item was evaluated by examining the AM fit statistics and by inspecting residuals from fitted item response curves from AM. The item response curves were visually examined by comparing the empirical item response functions with the theoretical curves. An example of item response curve is presented in figure 10. After removing 7 items that had negative adjusted biserial correlations based on classical item analyses and an additional 20 items as a result of poor item-fit, 237 items were successfully calibrated.

The large sample sizes required for assessment development also supplied more than a thousand ninth-grade student questionnaire observations. Some split ballot experimentation, and matrix sampling to increase the number of scales and individual items administered, were major opportunities to be exploited with this comparatively large sample. But because the main study design presupposed the administration of the same items to all students in the sample-and within severe time limits (35 minutes, 5 for locating data and 30 for substantive education issues-very substantial winnowing of field test items was required. An analysis of the timing suggested that for 95 percent of students to reach the final items, the instrument (defined as the totality of field test items) needed to be cut by about 40 percent. Winnowing of items was therefore critical to instrument revision for the main study. Because the included items were tried-and-true questions from past major national data collections, problems such as poor levels of item response were neither expected nor seen. In the end, most cuts or deletions were made on conceptual rather than empirical grounds. Within the conceptual framework for the student questionnaire (as discussed and illustrated in chapter 2), choices had to be made about the most important constructs to measure. Nevertheless, empirical analysis of the field test data provided evidence of the overall quality of the questionnaires. The minimum distributional criterion for any item is normally 7 that it exhibits non-zero variability. Additionally, response categories can be examined in relation to the frequency with which they are chosen so that the optimal categories for an array of response options can readily be identified. The codebooks were reviewed for distributional problems but, probably because the items had been used successfully before, distributional problems were but infrequently seen. However, in most instances in which poor distribution was exhibited (BSMGIMP will serve as an example), the problem could not readily be repaired by revising the categories of the response option. The pair of items (importance of good grades in math class, importance in science class) is therefore recommended for deletion. On a three-point scale of not at all important, somewhat important, and very important, only 7 students out of more than a thousand chose the negative pole, with 800 indicating that good math grades were very important and 179 that they were somewhat important. The same uninformative pattern was seen in science on a similar item with a 4-point scale (BSSMTV7) worded similarly (in terms of wanting to -keep up my grades\u2016 in science class.\u2016 There were 456 strongly agree, 399 agree, 11 disagree, and 7 strongly disagree. Likewise, on the item concerning why the student was taking his or her particular math or science course, there were excellent distributions for some items (e.g., for science, -It was assigned to you\u2016 split 466 -no\u2016 and 415 -yes\u2016 in BSSRSN12, with similar distribution for math), the item -You heard it was the easiest science class\u2016 (BSSRSN11) was dropped on the basis of its performance (only 26 -yes\u2016 and some 855 -no). The same pattern was observed in math."}, {"section_title": "Reliability of Scales, Item Scaling Properties", "text": "Some 13 scales were included on the student questionnaire. These scales are conceptualized, and analyzed, as simply the sum of the respondent's answers to a series of related questions. They provide a useful way to concatenate information about a particular dimension of interest for analysis purposes. Indeed, the intent of these scales is to provide a more reliable measure than could be achieved through use of a single item. For each scale, the following measures were computed: each item's correlation (Pearson's r) with the overall scale, each item's correlation with a scale computed without that item, and the overall reliability (i.e., internal consistency) of the scale (Cronbach's coefficient alpha;Cronbach 1951). The reliability coefficient, alpha (\u03b1), is the square of the correlation between the scale and underlying dimension or factor; \u03b1 thus represents the expected correlation of the scale with a scale formed from the same number of alternative items. Although this chapter provides a concise summary of findings concerning scale reliability, a far more detailed statement of reliability data may be found in appendix I. Scale reliabilities are displayed in table 24 below. An objective of the study was to have moderate to high reliability for all scales, and 0.80 or above was taken as the standard for high reliability, with reliabilities between 0.60 and 0.79 denoting moderate reliability (Nunnally and Bernstein 1994). 8 The range of reliabilities for the 13 scales extended from a high of 0.905 down to a low of 0.491. On the basis of the reliability criteria, of the 13 scales, 5 were highly reliable, another 6 were moderately reliable, and 2 failed to meet the standard even for moderate reliability. It was recommended that both of the low-reliability scales be dropped. In addition, some items within scales were recommended for deletion, based in part on item-to-total correlationsitems were identified that made only a small positive (or even negative) contribution to the scale as a whole.\n\nThe validity of the -school climate\u2016 scale in the HSLS:09 school administrator survey was evaluated through two methods. First, a principal component factor analysis (PCA) with orthogonal rotation (Varimax) was run to confirm the scale's underlying structure, that of a single dimension or component upon which all 14 items of the scale should load measuring the climate of the school, whether a chaotic and disruptive climate or a calm and harmonious one. The analysis produced three components; however, given the small sample size of the school administrator survey and the number and distribution of loadings above .60 and at or below .40, only one component was deemed reliable. Table 30 presents the results of the PCA. Most items loaded on the initial factor. A Cronbach's (Reliability) coefficient alpha with item-to-total statistics was performed as the second method for evaluating the validity of the School Climate scale. Overall, based on all 14 items, the scale rendered a .91 reliability coefficient. The item-to-total statistics showed that the scale would not increase in reliability if an item were deleted. Table 31 and table 32 show the results of the reliability and item-to-total correlation analyses, respectively. Three additional School Administrator Survey items that also contribute to the measurement of a school's climate were not included in this analysis, because they used a different survey response scale (a 4-point scale: serious, moderate, minor, no problem) than the response scale used with the other 14 items measuring school climate (5-point scale: daily, at least once a week, at least once a month, on occasion, never happens). The three items measured the extent to which tardiness, absenteeism, and class cutting were problems in a school.  "}, {"section_title": "Results of Questionnaire Experiments", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Time Budgets", "text": "Methodological work on the measurement of time use has shown that accurate reporting on time allocation to different activities is contingent on the span of recall and the type of activity. The most effective way to measure time use is to use a time diary approach, which for obvious reasons is not possible within the context of HSLS:09. Time use questions have been highly used in previous longitudinal studies, and there have been inconsistencies in student responses. In NELS:88, for example, high school sophomores were asked how much homework they did in total in all courses each week, then were asked to report homework time by subject. The sum of the subject-based answers considerably exceeds the initial total that 10th-graders reported. Likewise, open-ended continuous estimates in ELS:2002 seemed not always to blend well with category-based time estimation. It was therefore decided to use the HSLS:09 field test to experiment with how these questions are administered. To this end, two forms were created for the following question: About how many hours do you spend in a typical 7-day week during the school year doing each of the following? The first form was asked as it appears above. The second form used a -running total\u2016 display, such that each time the respondent filled in a response for each item in the series, the total was displayed at the bottom of the screen. This was done as a visual cue to prevent respondents from overreporting time spent on each. Responses from the two forms were compared overall and by subgroup. The subgroups employed were sex (male versus female), combined race-Hispanic ethnicity (Hispanic, Blacks, and Whites/other), educational attainment expectations (less than a BA degree, BA or higher), English language background (English mother tongue versus not), and whether the respondent completed the interview. The two formats supported 11 comparisons corresponding to the hourly estimate of time spent. Means and standard errors were computed, and the differences between the groups were examined for statistical significance through a t test procedure. Looked at overall, there were no statistically significant differences between the two formats. This finding was largely repeated for subgroups, with no detectable mode differences for males or females. There were no detectable differences for non-Hispanic Blacks, for those who aspired to less than a bachelor's degree, for a BA or higher, or to those from an Englishonly language background. Partial exceptions to this generalization were encountered for a handful of comparisons: some borderline significance for Hispanics (p = 0.07 for 8 hours spent); borderline significance for Whites/other at 1 hour spent (0.052) and 2 hours spent (0.084), and a significant difference for Whites/other at 9 hours (0.049). In addition to the student cases that were analyzed, a smaller set of cases (n = 385) was analyzed in which there was both a student report and a parent report. This was done so that parent education could be used as a subgroup category. However, there were no detectable differences based on having a parent with a BA or higher. The -running total\u2016 format took about 20 seconds longer in mean completion time for the series. Given this fact, and the high degree of similarity in the estimates produced by the two formats, the -running total\u2016 display is not recommended for the main study. On the other hand, although not based on empirical analysis of the field test data but on anecdotal sources, continuing concern about the cognitive processing load of open-ended time questions suggests that closed categories might be used in the main study."}, {"section_title": "Likert Scales With Versus Without the Middle (Neutral) Position", "text": "Some of the scales borrowed for the HSLS:09 field test were originally 5-point Likert scales and others 4-point. Although sometimes different response formats are needed for questions that differ in subject and intent it is preferable to have as much consistency of response format as possible, within a given questionnaire, to minimize the cognitive demand on the respondent. (In a longitudinal study, consistency is also needed across rounds.) Prior NCES high school cohort studies such as NELS:88 and ELS:2002 have typically used a 4-point Likert scale in agree/disagree formats. Normally the scale has been arrayed from positive to negative: strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree. A specific rationale for avoiding a neutral or -middle position\u2016 for agree-disagree questions is provided by Converse and Presser's Sage monograph (Survey Questions: Handcrafting the Standardized Questionnaire, 1986) on how to write survey questions: -Do not explicitly provide the middle category, and thereby lose information about the direction in which some people lean.\u2016 However, this is a debatable issue, with no conclusive evidence that shows that a neutral or middle position leads to a loss of information or results in biases. Moreover, the advantages or disadvantages of the middle position may conceivably vary with question content and the maturity or education level of the target survey population. An argument against the 4-point scale with no neutral position is that limiting options diminishes variation. More response options produce more variability and a better distribution for analytical purposes. An electronic administration allows for assigning a subset of alternatively scaled items to a random subset of survey completers so that comparisons of response formats can be undertaken in the field test analyses. This technological advantage was exploited in the field test instrumentation to test and compare 4-point versus 5-point response options. The results of this experiment may readily be summarized. Because there is no validity criterion, direct comparison is not a promising technique. However, one could hypothesize that if some students were truly neutral, when asked to choose only from non-neutral alternatives, their response would be to omit an answer for that item. One reasonable point of comparison, then, is whether the 4-point scale had a substantially higher rate of item nonresponse. The answer to this is -no.\u2016 Item nonresponse was low and for the two formats, comparable-a difference on the order of 1 percent. Moreover, as often as not the item nonresponse rate is higher for the 5-point scale, although only trivially so (for example, BSUTIL2X has item nonresponse of 23 out of 437 cases while BSUTIL2 has 18 illegitimate skips out of 411-thus item nonresponse is 5 percent for the 5-point scale and 4 percent for the 4-point). Clearly the hypothesis that not offering a middle position will result in higher item nonresponse finds no evidence in the field test data. Another criterion for judging the 4-versus 5-point scales has nothing to do with the intrinsic worth of either alternative in terms of analytic quality but rather reflects the practical time constraints on the survey and the penalty on how much can be asked that is imposed by questions that take longer to answer. Timings were examined for two groups: the 4-point form (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree) was taken by one set of randomly assigned students while the 5-point form (strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, strongly disagree) was taken by the other. Table 25 compares completion time for the two forms. In all six cases the 4-point scale took less time to answer. Although sometimes the differences were trivially small, in one instance the extra time for the 5-point form approached 10 seconds. In the case of the 4-versus 5-point Likert scale, it is clear from the data that the 5-point scale takes slightly longer to answer. Very often time constraints influence or even outright dictate survey or assessment format. Given the severe time limit on the student survey-35 minutes, as opposed to about an hour in HS&B and NELS:88 and 45 minutes in ELS:2002-the timing data for the two forms may point to a preference, all other factors being equal. In HSLS:09, -mark all that apply\u2016 formats were therefore often used in the field test student instrument in preference to an explicit yes/no choice, to save time, even though the data quality argument would slightly favor the explicit yes-no format (vide the classic NELS:88 field test analysis, Rasinski, Mingay, and Bradburn 1994). Likewise, the mathematics assessment employs multiple choice items exclusively and avoids constructed response for the same reason-not because the format is superior, but because it is adequate, and quicker."}, {"section_title": "Administrative Records (Eighth Grade)", "text": "During the collection of parent and teacher lists, discussed in section 2.1, schools were also asked to provide administrative records for eighth-grade coursetaking for sample ninthgrade students. Schools were specifically asked to provide the name of the mathematics and science course taken in the eighth grade and the grade earned in each grade. Eighth-grade administrative records were provided by 31 of the 41 participating schools."}, {"section_title": "Eighth-Grade Records Recommendations for Main Study", "text": "RTI recommends eliminating the eighth-grade administrative records collection. Ninthgrade schools varied widely on what information they had available from their feeder schools, and the format in which it was available. Many high school staff complained that it was time consuming to pull the requested information together from the feeder schools. The lists that RTI received were inconsistent between schools (or even within ninth-grade schools, since a given high school may have many public and private feeder schools) on the course titles and grading schemes. For course titles, some schools were able to report that students took specific courses such as Algebra I, but many schools reported relatively opaque course titles such as -Math 8\u2016 or -eighth-grade math.\u2016 The lack of standardization among grading systems between eighth-grade schools was also problematic. Schools varied in providing numeric grades, letter grades (some including +/-and others not), and indicators of pass/fail. In the main study, RTI will be collecting administrative records data from the state for participating schools in 10 predetermined states, and recommends gathering this information as part of that records collection from the state. However, this only covers a subset of the schools, and provides a resource to states, not a national resource. HSLS:09 should therefore attempt to collect eighth-grade administrative information from student transcripts at the end of high school for all sampled students. Although not all high school transcripts will have information about eighth grade, experience of past transcript studies (NELS:88, ELS:2002) suggests that many will. Although coverage from transcripts will be quite incomplete, at least some missing information can eventually be filled in from one of two additional sources: (1) inference from ninth-grade course, based on standard prerequisites that would normally have been completed in eighth grade; and (2) student questionnaire self-report (for both math and science, students were asked about eighth-grade course title and grades). Generation of a composite variable will thus eventually be possible that provides coverage on this item through all or almost all of the participating sample. The disadvantage of this is the long wait for the information from high school transcripts. However, in the meantime, questionnaire self-report data will be available."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Teacher, School Administrator, and Counselor Survey Results", "text": "This section discusses results obtained from methodological analysis of the teacher, school administrator, and counselor questionnaires.

The overall average time for mathematics teachers to complete the field test survey was 29 minutes; the average time for science teachers was 28 minutes (table 26). Based on their responses in the Introduction section of the survey, teachers were guided to sections A, B, and D if they taught mathematics, and to sections A, C, and D if they taught science. A few teachers taught both mathematics and science and were asked to respond to all four sections. The Introduction section asked teachers to confirm the list of preloaded courses they taught and took respondents fewer than 10 seconds to complete. Indeed, the teacher course preloads worked well. Few teachers had a third (six cases) or fourth (two cases) math class with HSLS:09 students, and there were zero with five, so we report only on those who taught one or two classes. In mathematics, for the first preloaded class, about 4 percent (8) were disconfirmed and 96 percent (179) confirmed. For the second preloaded class, 7 percent (4) were disconfirmed and 53 (93 percent) confirmed. Results were similar in science: the first preloaded class was disconfirmed 2 times and confirmed in 139 instances; the second preloaded science class was disconfirmed 0 times and confirmed in 20 instances. There were only a total of four teachers in the three and four preloaded science classes category, and one teacher with five classes. The items in section A focused on demographic data (e.g., sex, race/ethnicity), and education and professional background, including certification. The mathematics teachers who took the survey responded to 62 items in this section, with an average completion time of 9.26 minutes. The science teachers responded to 64 items and, on average, they took 9.47 minutes to complete this section. Sections B and C focused on teachers' instruction in the targeted class(es) and their opinions about the mathematics or science departments in their schools. These two sections had almost the same number of items; mathematics teachers took an average of 12.24 minutes and science teachers took an average of 11.03 minutes to complete this section. Section D was the final section, taking an average of 7.38 minutes across all respondents. This section asked teachers' opinions about their principal and fellow teachers in the school. Teachers were also asked how various factors influence their teaching.\nThe following analysis is based on data from 36 counselor surveys. The overall average time to complete the field test counselor survey was 23.24 minutes. The time to complete the individual sections ranged from 4.97 minutes to 12.58 minutes (table 33). The items in section A focused on staffing, counselor responsibilities, and services offered by the school's counseling department. Overall, respondents took 12.58 minutes to complete the 83 items in this section. Section B focused on the factors associated with students' mathematics and science course placement. Overall, respondents completed this section in 5.69 minutes. The shortest section to complete was section C, taking an average of 4.97 minutes. This final section asked counselors' opinions about the principal, teachers in the school, and the counseling department itself. In addition, counselors were asked several questions about their education and professional background.\nOn average, the parent interview took 29.7 minutes to complete, just under the targeted duration of 30 minutes. Although the identical instrument was used in both modes of administration, telephone interviews lasted 2 minutes longer on average than self-administered interviews (30.4 minutes versus 28.4 minutes). Approximately 65 percent of interviews were conducted over the telephone, and 35 percent were web self-administrations. The interview was divided into seven sections. The first two sections collected data on family structure, country of origin, and language. These sections were brief for most respondents, each taking an average of 2.3 minutes to complete. Section C collected information on the educational background and occupations of the respondent and a spouse or partner. 9 This section was relatively lengthy because the parents' major fields of study and occupations were coded. Telephone interviewers administered this section in 5.4 minutes on average, 1 minute faster than parents who completed the interview on their own. Telephone interviewers' familiarity with the online coding systems probably contributed to this difference. An alternative explanation may be that parents who were able to interact with the online coders spent more time looking for the best code. Section D gathered factual data on the ninth-grader's previous educational experiences. Its completion averaged about 3 minutes. Section E, which asked about parents' involvement in their ninth-grader's formal and informal education, was one of the longest, particularly for telephone interviews. Section G collected information about parents' hopes and expectations for their ninth-grader's future education. Although this section was brief in both modes, it took longer to administer over the telephone. The last section, which collected locating information for future follow-up, was the longest, averaging about 8 minutes. This was 3 minutes longer than the targeted duration of 5 minutes.

However, there were two items where the distribution of responses indicated that some of the response options did not make sense for the target audience. The following is an analysis of these items.\nOverall, responses to the items were well distributed. Seven items in which the distribution was limited are described below.

(d) discipline? (e) participation in enrichment programs? (f) college preparation? There was little (or in the case of course placement, no) variation in participants' responses; the direction of response was, for each option, positive; that is, indicative that consultation does occur. As a result, it is recommended that this item be removed from the survey. Even though the distribution of responses to this item centered on the same side of the scale for each response option, there is variation in the strength of agreement (for example, for -Counselors in this school set high standards for students' learning\u2016 47 percent strongly agree and 53 percent agree; for -Counselors in this school believe all students can do well\u2016 some 33 percent strongly agree and 67 percent agree).

Similar to the previous item on counselors' opinions, there is some variation in the strength of agreement, even though the distribution of responses centered on the same side of the scale for each response option. It is recommended that this item be retained to understand counselors' perspectives of their fellow counselors.\nThe frequencies for all questions in the parent interview were reviewed for distributional properties. Subjective questions with highly skewed distributions may be candidates for elimination. Factual questions with unexpected distributions may indicate that respondents are not interpreting the question as intended or are not the best source for the information. A discussion of questions from the parent interview with undesirable distributions follows. Parents who indicated that their ninth-grader had an Individual Education Plan (IEP) were asked to identify the disability category. Close to half of these parents (42.4 percent) selected the -other\u2016 category. When asked to provide further information, 6 of these 25 parents indicated that their teenager had a learning disability, one of the response options provided. Another six of these parents reported that their child had ADD or ADHD; it is unclear how this should be classified. This question seems to be difficult for many parents to answer given the response options provided. School administrative records data may be a better source than parent report for disability type. Parents were asked -In the past year, how often did you discuss the following subjects with your ninth-grader?\u2016 Response options were -never,\u2016 -rarely,\u2016 -sometimes,\u2016 and -often.\u2016 Seven topics of discussion were presented. As seen in table 36, for all seven topics of discussion presented to respondents, only a small percentage of parents answered -never\u2016 or -rarely.\u2016 This suggests that the question may be subject to social desirability bias. The subjective response options, as opposed to behavioral options (e.g., once a week), may be a contributing factor. Parents were also asked how often they had been contacted by their ninth-grader's school about his or her problem behavior, poor attendance record, and poor academic performance. Response options were subjective categories; -never,\u2016 -rarely,\u2016 -sometimes,\u2016 and -often.\u2016 The response distributions were skewed toward -never\u2016 and -rarely.\u2016 This would be the expected response distribution given the response options, but behavioral response options anchored in number of instances would be a better measure of actual frequency (table 37). Another question addressed whether there were rules for the ninth-grader about earning acceptable grades and doing homework. The vast majority of parents reported that there were such rules (table 38). The analytic utility of these data is questionable. Similarly, parents who reported that they believed their ninth-grader would continue his or her education after high school were asked if they planned to help their ninth-grader pay for this postsecondary education. The vast majority of respondents reported that they planned to help (89.4 percent). Finally, all parents were asked how important various academic subjects were for their ninth-grader to meet his or her educational goals. Response options were -extremely important,\u2016 -very important,\u2016 -not very important,\u2016 and -not at all important.\u2016 The vast majority of parents believed that these four subjects were extremely or very important. Only science elicited -not very important\u2016 or -not at all important\u2016 responses from more than 5 percent of parents (table 39). Closing open-ended responses. There were six questions in the parent interview for which an -other\u2016 response was followed by a request for specific information. The verbatim responses to these follow-up requests were evaluated to determine whether the addition of new response options was warranted. In most cases, the answer provided matched a response option that was provided. At times the responses suggested new response categories or rewording of questions for clarity. Parents who did not live with their ninth-grader all of the time were asked with whom their ninth-grader lived the rest of the time. All but two respondents indicated that their children lived with another parent or an adult relative. The other two parents selected the -other\u2016 option. When asked to specify with whom the ninth-grader lives at other times, one parent provided an answer that could be coded into the -adult relative\u2016 response option. The other parent provided a response which was too vague to interpret. Parents who reported that a language other than English is regularly spoken in their home were asked to identify the other language(s). Nine parents chose the -other\u2016 option. Five of these parents reported languages for which an appropriate response option was not provided in the close-ended list. Three reported that language to be Creole, one Latin, and one American Sign Language. The other activities specified in response to -During the last 12 months, has your ninthgrader participated in any of the following activities outside of school?\u2016 identified some gaps in the list provided. For example, 15 parents reported that their ninth-grader had done volunteer work or community service, an activity not listed. Membership in youth organizations such as 4-H and FFA was reported by six parents. Eight parents indicated that their ninth-grader participated in church-related activities that may not have precisely fit within -Religious youth group or religious instruction\u2016 (e.g., -church camp,\u2016 -altar serving at church\u2016). Some common responses suggest that not all parents were interpreting the question as intended. Fifty-eight parents indicated that their ninth-grader participated in sports. Many of the sports activities were clearly not taking place outside of school (e.g., -high school cheerleading\u2016 and -sports in school\u2016). While some of the sports activities cited could be classified as -organized sports supervised by an adult\u2016 in many instances they were not (e.g., riding bike). Music and performing arts were the second most frequent activity; reported by 36 parents. In most cases these appeared to be out-of-school lessons that would have fit within the -Music, dance, art, or theater\u2016 option in the list provided. Parents who indicated that their ninth-grader had an IEP were asked to identify the disability category. Twenty-five of these parents selected -other\u2016 and provided further information. Six indicated that their teenager had either ADD or ADHD. Six other parents reported a learning disability. While at the federal level, IEPs are limited to disabilities, in a number of states, IEPs may also be drawn up to reflect special educational plans for gifted students. Although only three parents reported that their children were gifted, it may be advisable to add a response option for this because it is markedly different from the other choices. Parents whose teenagers had academic instruction outside of school were asked about the subject areas of that instruction. The subjects listed were reading, writing, math, science, and other. When -other\u2016 was chosen, further information was requested. The two most frequently reported subjects were history/social studies and foreign languages. These should be added to the subject areas listed. Two parents indicated -keyboarding\u2016 and another two -computers.\u2016 It may be advisable to add these in a single category such as -computers/keyboarding.\u2016 The last question with an open-ended -other\u2016 response category asked parents: -In the last year, which of the following activities have you or another family member done with your ninth-grader?\u2016 The activities listed were all related to science, technology, engineering, or math. The last option on the list was -Another science, technology, engineering or math-related activity.\u2016 More than 100 parents provided another activity. Almost all of the responses suggest that parents understood that the question pertained only to STEM activities even though the question was not qualified in this way. Many of the responses were ones that would have belonged in one of the options provided. Also, many of the responses appear to be school activities such as helping with homework or a school science project; in many instances these can be explicitly added in for the main study."}, {"section_title": "BTMTHCRS:", "text": "Which of the following best describes the content of [mathematics course title]?

Although such a question series is relatively burdensome, it should elicit valuable information in many contexts. Nonetheless, within the HSLS:09 design, one may question the value of textbook information. Because the study takes a measurement early in the fall ninthgrade term, questions about use, percentage of the book to be used, and so on, tap plans, hopes, and expectations, rather than reports on a stable historical reality. In addition, the longitudinal character of HSLS:09 would seem to militate against a textbook information collection at the start of ninth grade. This is the case because to relate textbook use to mathematics achievement growth and other outcomes would require term-by-term textbook data up to the testing point in first follow-up. Given the high burden and limited value of a cross-sectional elicitation of textbook name and use, it may be prudent to drop the textbook questions for the main study."}, {"section_title": "Reliability of Scales", "text": "The survey included items that were intended to form five scales: Perceptions of Teacher Expectations; Perceptions of a Professional Learning Community; Teacher Self-Efficacy; Perceptions of Principal Support; and Perceptions of Collective Responsibility.

In terms of timing, the school administrator instrument fielded 372 items (68 whole questions comprising sub-items) and averaged 42 minutes in length, 12 minutes longer than the time desired for the main study. Timings by section were section A, 9.17 minutes; section B, 11.5 minutes; section C, 6.43 minutes; section D, 6.16 minutes; and section E, 9.09 minutes. Results of the analyses were used to improve and winnow items. Poorly performing items were candidates for deletion. Other criteria used to winnow items were the recommendations of HSLS:09 Technical Review Panel (TRP) members and the decision that the school counselor is a better respondent for an item than the school principal. The primary analyses performed were an analysis of item nonresponse and an analysis of scale reliability. The school administrator survey included one scale on school climate. A principal component factor analysis was performed to confirm the scale's underlying structure followed by a reliability analysis (i.e., Cronbach's Coefficient Alpha) with item-total statistics. The results of all analyses are presented below. It is important to keep in mind when interpreting the results of the field test and recommendations for the main study that 36 school administrators (out of 41 schools that agreed to participate) from 5 field test states responded in the field test. Table 28 shows the characteristics of responding schools. Although participating schools represented a range of school types and locations, the field test sample was purposive and small, and thus may not indicate problematic items well. When it was difficult to interpret why items performed poorly, when possible, comparisons were made to how similar items from other National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) studies with nationally representative samples performed. Many of the HSLS:09 field test items were taken from previous NCES and other large-scale nationally representative surveys. "}, {"section_title": "Item Nonresponse Analysis", "text": "This section examines item nonresponse for the HSLS:09 school administrator survey. A total of 36 school administrator surveys were completed online. Two respondents terminated their online session approximately one third and two thirds, respectively, of the way through the survey. Additionally, only two surveys were completed by someone other than the school principal. Item nonresponse was calculated by dividing the number of administrators who inappropriately skipped a question by the number of administrators who were eligible for that question. Skips are legitimate if the respondent was routed around the question, for example, through a gate or filter question. Skips are illegitimate if the respondent fails to answer a question addressed to the respondent. -Don't know\u2016 is treated as a legitimate response, when an explicit option is offered. The following formula was used: Number of illegitimate skips (# of questionnaire respondents -# of legitimate skips) Each case missing data has a relatively large impact on the overall nonresponse rate because there are only 36 completed questionnaires. Nonetheless, NCES deems an item nonresponse rate greater than 15 percent as -high.\u2016 All -high\u2016 nonresponse items are required to undergo an item nonresponse bias analysis (Seastrom 2002;Standard 4-4). Based on NCES Statistical Standard 4-4, all field test items that registered greater than 15 percent nonresponse (n = 6) were flagged as problematic and considered for revision or deletion. Table 29 presents all field test items that registered an item nonresponse rate of greater than 15 percent. Overall, item nonresponse ranged from 2.8 percent (n = 1) to 66.7 percent (n = 24 unit). Of the 372 items on the school administrator survey, 13.4 percent (n = 50) had a nonresponse rate over 15 percent. These 50 items comprised only 9 survey questions; that is, all problematic items were subparts (i.e., sub-items) of a single, whole, question and if one of the subparts showed problems, chances were fairly high that other subparts also showed problems. The results of the item nonresponse analysis are presented for each question.  BATYPA/B asked -What type of school is this: Would you say. . .\u2016 and followed with 21 school characteristics that were presented to respondents on two screens (A/B) in the online field test survey. Of the 21 school-characteristic sub-items that principals could select to describe their school, 20 registered a nonresponse rate of over 15 percent, ranging from a low of 25.0 percent (n = 9) to a high of 41.7 percent (n = 15) with the majority of nonresponse rates hovering around 33 to 36 percent. Although this was a long and tedious question, and no doubt should be shortened, the difficulty may not primarily be a matter of length. This item was taken with minor modification from the Education Longitudinal Study of (ELS:2002) base-year school administrator questionnaire. In that nationally representative survey, nonresponse for this item averaged 2 percent. Therefore, it was surprising to find item nonresponse so high in the HSLS:09 field test. Indeed, there is a format-based explanation for the high nonresponse. Closer scrutiny of the nonresponse rates across all 21 sub-items suggested that a solid block of 13 principals engaged in a response pattern of -clicking\u2016 only -Yes\u2016 when a characteristic applied rather than -Yes\u2016 when a characteristic applied and -No\u2016 when it did not. An array of the responses of all 36 principals to all sub-items confirmed this hypothesis. Thirteen principals consistently responded only -Yes\u2016 when a characteristic applied and did not respond -No\u2016 when a characteristic did not apply. Further comparison of the ELS:2002 question, which was administered primarily through a self-administered questionnaire, with the HSLS:09 online survey question revealed that the HSLS:09 question did not include the respondent instruction to -Mark one response-Yes or No-for each characteristic listed.\u2016 The high nonresponse for all 21 sub-items is attributed to absence of this respondent instruction. Assuming reduction in length of the main study questionnaire, instructions should be added to mark one response (yes or no) for each listed characteristic. Alternatively, if the final length is at the high end of the acceptable range it may be prudent to let administrators check the -yes\u2016 option only; that is, to effectively change the format to -mark all that apply.\u2016 Finally, reduction of the number of subitems-to preserve only the school type variables that have actually been used in analysis in prior studies such as ELS:2002, or that are thought to have sufficient numbers to be analytically usefulshould also be considered. Winnowing of these items will be important regardless of the final decision about -mark all that apply\u2016 versus -explicit yes/no\u2016 formats. BARACE asked -What percentage of the total student body in your school are members of the following groups? Count each student only once. Do not count students for whom race is unknown. Round to the nearest whole number.\u2016 Information was sought for five racial categories: White, Black, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and American Indian or Alaska Native. Three of the five sub-items that comprised this question registered a nonresponse rate over 15 percent. A similar question was asked in the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) first follow-up school administrator questionnaire, for which item nonresponse averaged 2.6 percent for the same three sub-items. As with BATYPA/B, the NELS:88 question included the instruction to respondents to -Enter 000, if none.\u2016 No such instruction was provided to HSLS:09 online survey respondents. Additional challenges in answering this question may derive from administrators' not knowing the ethnicity or mixed ethnicity of their students, especially when asked to -count each student only once\u2016 and from the concentration of these students in particular areas or schools; a large proportion of schools probably do not have Asian, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and American Indian or Alaska Native students in attendance. The high nonresponse for the three sub-items is attributed to the absence of the instruction to -Enter 000, if none\u2016 and the cognitively demanding instructions to -Count each student only once. Do not count students for whom race is unknown.\u2016 Recommendation: add the respondent instruction to -Enter 000, if none.\u2016 BA12LAST asked \u2016What percentage of last year's 12th-grade class went on to. . .\u2016 and followed with five sub-items, four of which are presented in table 29 with over 15 percent nonresponse. The question was taken from the ELS:2002 first follow-up school administrator questionnaire with modifications. The two sub-items of -went on to 2-year institution\u2016 and -went on to technical/trade school\u2016 were decoupled in HSLS:09 and asked separately. So too were the two sub-items of -entered the workforce\u2016 and -joined the military.\u2016 Additionally, the ELS question asked respondents to mark one of five prespecified percentage ranges, such as -1-10%,\u2016 -11-24%,\u2016 etc., whereas the HSLS:09 question allowed respondents to enter a percentage. The ELS question also included a -None\u2016 response option, whereas the HSLS:09 question included no instructions to respondents to -Enter 000, if none.\u2016 The ELS:2002 question averaged a nonresponse rate of 9.7 percent for the similar sub-items. Even for the sub-item that most schools track, -went on to 4-year institution,\u2016 the item nonresponse rate in ELS was 8.6 percent. Clearly, no matter how well the question is structured, principals have a difficult time answering it; they just -don't know.\u2016 However, the inclusion of the respondent instruction to -Enter 000, if none,\u2016 should help decrease item nonresponse, as should combining sub-items as was done in ELS:2002. BANUMTCH asked -For each of the areas listed below, please indicate the number of full-time teachers and part-time teachers in your high school. Please give your best estimate. (If a teacher works full-time in your school, but divides his/her time between two or more subject areas, consider that teacher as part-time in each subject or area.),\u2016 and followed with 12 subject-specific sub-items (e.g., math, history, physical education) each for full-time teachers and part-time teachers. All 12 subject-specific sub-items for part-time teachers employed at the school registered nonresponse rates of over 15 percent. Two subject-specific sub-items for fulltime teachers had nonresponse rates of over 15 percent. A similar question on number of fulltime teaching staff only was asked in ELS; no previous NCES secondary-school longitudinal study has asked about numbers of part-time teaching staff by specific subjects. As with other items in the HSLS:09 online school administrator survey with nonresponse rates over 15 percent, respondents were not instructed to -Enter 00, if none.\u2016 While such an instruction would surely help limit item nonresponse, clearly asking about the number of full-and part-time teachers in 12 subjects, for a total of 24 entries, is extremely time-consuming and burdensome and would prompt even the most meticulous of principals to skip one or more sub-items. Indeed, one of the two respondents who terminated his or her survey partway through his or her session terminated it at this question. High item nonresponse for this question is attributed to the absence of the instruction to -Enter 00, if none\u2016 and the burdensome list of subjects being asked about. BADEGREE asked -What were your major and minor (or second major) fields of study for your undergraduate degree?\u2016 and followed with three sub-items: -major,\u2016 -minor,\u2016 and -second major.\u2016 Only the sub-item -second major field of study\u2016 had a nonresponse rate of over 15 percent. Prior NCES secondary-school studies did not collect these data from principals; however, such data were collected from teachers. In the ELS:2002 math and English teacher questionnaires, undergraduate -minor\u2016 and -second major\u2016 were represented by one sub-item (minor/second major), which averaged an item nonresponse student-coverage rate of 4 percent. A crosstab of the HSLS:09 separate -minor\u2016 and -second major\u2016 sub-items revealed that of the 19 principals who did not respond to the -second major\u2016 sub-item, 14 responded to the -minor\u2016 sub-item. Only five principals (13.8 percent) failed to answer both sub-items. Perhaps, the wording of the main question that asked principals to indicate their major and minor (or second major) confused them, despite the fact that all three sub-items included a -does not apply\u2016 response option. After indicating their major and minor, principals skipped the -second major\u2016 sub-item, since they were instructed to indicate either their minor or second major field of study and they had already indicated their minor. The high rate of nonresponse for this item is attributed to the confusing wording of the main question relative to the way the sub-items are presented to respondents. BAGRAD asked -What were your major and minor (or second major) fields of study for your graduate degree?\u2016 and followed with three sub-items: -major,\u2016 -minor,\u2016 and -second major.\u2016 The two sub-items of -minor\u2016 and -second major\u2016 registered nonresponse rates of over 15 percent. Like BADEGREE, respondents may have been confused by the wording of the main question that asked them to indicate either their minor or second major. A crosstab of the separate -minor\u2016 and -second major\u2016 sub-items showed that 19 respondents (52.7 percent) failed to answer either sub-item. In ELS:2002, the average nonresponse student-coverage rate for math and English teachers to a similar item was 5 percent. Again, in ELS:2002, -minor\u2016 and -second major\u2016 fields of study were combined into one sub-item (minor/second major). The confusing wording of the main question, however, is probably not solely responsible for the 52.7 percent item nonresponse rate. A minor and second major in graduate school are rare. Principals may be skipping this item because they do not have a graduate minor or second major and they failed to mark -does not apply.\u2016 This item also appears at the end of the online survey and respondents may have become fatigued. BAEXPTCH asked principals -Before you became a principal, how many years of elementary, middle, or secondary teaching experience did you have?\u2016 and followed with three sub-items: -elementary,\u2016 -middle,\u2016 and -secondary.\u2016 Two of the three sub-items, years of experience teaching -elementary\u2016 and -middle,\u2016 produced nonresponse rates of over 15 percent. It is difficult to conclude why item nonresponse is high for these two sub-items. A three-way crosstab of -elementary\u2016 by -middle\u2016 by -secondary\u2016 teaching experience revealed that most principals had teaching experience at one or more of these levels. The pattern of responding suggested that only four principals had no prior teaching experience at any of these levels. These principals either correctly entered -0\u2016 (as instructed) if no teaching experience (one principal), or did not enter a valid response for any sub-item (three principals). The remaining principals entered a valid response for a least one sub-item. Perhaps for reason of efficiency or owing to fatigue, since this item appeared at the end of the survey, principals only entered a valid response for the sub-items that applied. BAPRTCH asked principals -Since becoming a principal, how many years of elementary, middle, or secondary teaching experience do you have?\" and followed with three sub-items: -elementary,\u2016 -middle,\u2016 and -secondary.\u2016 As with BAEXPTCH, two of the three subitems, -elementary\u2016 and -middle,\u2016 registered nonresponse rates over 15 percent (but somewhat lower than the nonresponse rates for these same sub-items under BAEXPTCH). A three-way crosstab of -elementary\u2016 by -middle\u2016 by -secondary\u2016 teaching experience after becoming a principal showed the same -efficient\u2016 pattern of responding as with BAEXPTCH. Only 2 principals failed to provide a valid response to any sub-item (these two principals terminated their survey session at some point earlier), 14 principals had no teaching experience after becoming a principal (they correctly entered -0\u2016 for all three sub-items), and the remaining 20 principals entered a valid response for at least one sub-item. As with BAEXPTCH, the length of the survey and fatigue probably played a role at this point and exacerbated principals' tendency toward expedience. BASPENT asked principals -What percentage of your work hours do you spend on the following activities in an average week?\u2016 and followed with a list of 10 activities, including -other activities.\u2016 Two sub-items, -hours spent on principal's own teaching assignment\u2016 and -hours spent on other activities\u2016 registered nonresponse rates over 15 percent. An array of all 36 respondents' responses to the 10 sub-items revealed, like question BATYPA/B above, a response propensity to skip a sub-item when it probably did not apply. It appears -other\u2016 was skipped by most principals because it did not apply; in these cases, it was not needed to account for 100 percent of their time. This item, like other items in the online survey, also did not include an instruction to respondents to -Enter 0, if no time was spent on the activity.\u2016 Apart from changes in instructions, it should be considered whether this item should be asked in its original form (as on the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Cohort base-year school administrator questionnaire), which elicited units of time, or asked in percentage units instead of hours, as was done in the HSLS:09 field test. The problem with the percents approach is having to calculate, on a base of 10 subitems, the percentage for each, constrained to a sum of 100 percent (although it is arguable whether all the categories are tightly mutually exclusive). Because it seems cognitively less demanding to ask for hours, hours may also supply a more accurate measure."}, {"section_title": "Closing Open-Ended Responses", "text": "Twenty-one of the survey's 68 questions included an -other, please specify\u2016 response option. The option was included to validate and refine the field test question and its list of response options, and build an exhaustive set of options for the main study. Write-in responses offered insight into respondents' understanding of the question as intended by the survey's developers, and vice versa, whether the question as worded or structured captured the survey developers' intent (i.e., was valid; the question measured what it was supposed to measure). For example, respondents were invited to write in the names of other math courses the school offered after first responding to a list of 21 closed-ended math courses. Sixteen respondents, or 44 percent of principals, wrote in at least one additional math course, none of which were the same across respondents. This reinforced for developers that the intent of the item was not to collect an exhaustive list of all math courses schools offer, but to collect only those universal, marker courses that measure students' opportunity to learn. A review of the write-in responses to all 21 open-ended items revealed that respondents understood the survey's questions as developers intended. Additionally, for almost all questions, all write-in responses were unique, which indicated that the field test response options were fairly exhaustive (since a large percentage of respondents did not write in the same response), but that schools vary considerably in their offerings and practices. However, respondents' openended responses identified two questions that as worded would not capture developers' intent. One was the previously mentioned question on math courses offered at the school and the second was a question on which specific math courses, if any, schools required for high school graduation. Although respondents understood the question, it was not structured in a way that captured accurate responses. In some cases, respondents' write-in responses indicated that the field test response options need to be broadened, made more global and generic to capture the many variants of, for example, offering tutorial assistance to struggling ninth-graders. In other cases, respondents' write-in responses suggested the opposite; that is, that the field test response options needed to be more specific. The write-in response options will be used to refine the field test list of response options on a case-by-case basis. Because of the small size of the school administrator sample, it is recommended that all 21 questions discussed here, if kept in the main study survey, continue to offer an -other,\u2016 but closed-ended, response option. It is highly likely that the refined list of response options to these 21 questions will not be exhaustive for a number of main study schools, leaving these schools no option to mark and forcing them to skip the item and increase item nonresponse.\nThere were 14 questions on the field test survey that solicited an open-ended response.

Analyses conducted to evaluate item performance are reported below."}, {"section_title": "Reliability Reinterview Results", "text": "A subsample of computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) respondents was selected at random to complete a reinterview designed to assess the temporal stability of selected questions from the parent interview. Reinterviews were conducted in CATI at least 2 weeks following the completion of the first interview. By the end of data collection, 55 parents had completed a telephone reinterview. The reinterview consisted of questions for which clarity was uncertain because they were newly written for the HSLS:09 base-year field test parent instrument, were lengthy, or used terminology that may not have been familiar to parents. Items were not selected if it was anticipated that the correct response may in fact change within a period of several weeks or not enough respondents would be administered the item to yield sufficient data for analysis. Thirtyone items associated with 13 questions were selected for the reinterview. These are displayed in table 40. Percent agreement was based on cases where a response was provided in both interviews. Percent agreement ranged from 65 to 100 percent, with 21 of the items having matched responses in at least 85 percent of the cases. A discussion of the 10 items which had interview-reinterview agreement in less than 85 percent of the cases follows. Number of times ninth-grader has changed schools 75.5 p < .0001 \u2020 Not applicable. NOTE: IEP = individual education plan. STEM = science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Invalid: chi square for this item could be invalid; 83% of the cells have expected counts less than 5. SOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, HSLS:09 Base-Year Field Test. The first two items that did not meet the 85 percent threshold were sub-items to the following question: -During the last 12 months, has your ninth-grader participated in any of the following activities outside of school?\u2016 Most of the sub-items to this question had high temporal reliability. One item that did not was -organized sports supervised by an adult.\u2016 It may be that parents are interpreting the item differently at different points in time. Some ambiguity may stem from the qualifiers -outside of school,\u2016 -organized,\u2016 and -supervised by an adult.\u2016 For example, it may be unclear whether -outside of school\u2016 means outside of school hours or unaffiliated with the school. The other qualifiers may be open to interpretation as well. The other item with relatively low agreement was -any other regular activities or lessons.\u2016 If a parent reported that there was another activity a follow-up question asked them to provide specific information. While some of these verbatim responses identified gaps in the list of activities provided (discussed in section 7.1), other responses suggested that the question was too general for a catch-all -other\u2016 item. Five of the items that fell below the 85 percent agreement threshold were associated with the following question: -In the last year, which of the following activities have you or another family member done with your ninth-grader?\u2016 All of the sub-items were activities related to science, technology, engineering, or math. This question was written for the HSLS:09 base-year field test. Given the relatively poor reliability of five of its seven items, this question is a candidate for elimination in the main study. The next three questions that fell below the desired threshold of 85 percent agreement were also newly written. The first of these asked: -How much influence do you think you have on the choices your ninth-grader makes about school?\u2016 The response options were -none,\u2016 -a little,\u2016 -some,\u2016 and -a lot.\u2016 Almost all parents responded -some\u2016 or -a lot\u2016 in the first interview. It is likely that the distinction between these two categories is too subjective. Another newly written question asked: -Between the start of eighth grade and now, has your ninth-grader had any academic instruction outside of school such as from a Saturday Academy, learning center, personal tutor, or summer school program?\u2016 In 8 of the 11 inconsistent cases, parents answered -no\u2016 in the main interview and -yes\u2016 in the reinterview. It may be that completing the interview primed parents to think about their ninth-grader's educational experiences and helped them later recall some out-of-school academic instruction that went unreported in the first interview. The final new question asked -In the past year, how often did you talk with other parents about school events, courses, or teachers at the school your teenager attended last year? The response options were -never,\u2016 -rarely,\u2016 -sometimes,\u2016 -often.\u2016 The five parents who answered -never\u2016 were consistent in their responses. Most of the shifts in responses came from parents who answered -often\u2016 or -sometimes\u2016 in the first interview and adjusted their responses one level downward to -sometimes\u2016 or -rarely.\u2016 Vague quantifiers like these response options are subjective and therefore more susceptible to instability. The last question that did not meet the 85 percent threshold for reliability is one that has been used on National Center for Education Statistics high school cohort studies in the past (e.g., ELS:2002, NELS:88): -How many times has your ninth-grader changed schools since [he or she] first entered school? Do not count changes that occurred as a result of promotion to the next grade or level (for example, a move from an elementary school to a middle school or from a middle school to a high school in the same district).\u2016 The cognitive burden for this question is apparent from the timing analysis; it took 24 seconds on average for parents to respond. Of the 13 parents who supplied a different number of school changes in the reinterview, 10 parents were off by only 1 school change, indicating only a moderate discrepancy between interview and reinterview."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Context Effects", "text": "Because females are less likely than males to persist in the STEM pipeline, there is research interest in identifying the causes of this disparity (Huang, Taddese, and Walter 2000). Gender stereotypes about ability in science and math may play a role. Therefore, parents were asked about how they compare boys and girls in their math and science ability. Parents were also asked about reading and writing, domains stereotypically favorable to women, with the intent of providing balance to the question and to minimizing social desirability biases. An analysis was conducted to determine if the order in which the four items (math, science, reading, and writing) were presented influenced parents' responses. It was hypothesized that parents would be more likely to admit that they believed boys are better than girls in math or science if they were first able state their belief that girls are better in other academic areas such as reading and writing. The four academic domains were presented in one of four ways; the first domain listed was randomly selected and the remaining three domains followed in the prescribed sequence. Overall, parents' gender stereotypes about girls' and boys' abilities in math, science, reading, and writing were in the predicted direction. Although the majority of parents indicated that girls and boys have the same ability in math and science, about 28 percent believed that boys were better in math and 22 percent believed boys were better in science (table 41). In contrast, 44 percent of parents indicated that they believed that girls were better in reading; 58 percent believed that girls were better at writing. Overall, the data do not support the hypothesis that the order in which the subject areas are presented in the question influenced parents' responses. Parents' comparisons of boys' and girls' abilities in math, science, and writing were not significantly different across the four variations on order. Reading was the exception. Parents who were questioned about reading first (followed by math, science, and writing) or last (preceded by math, science, and writing) were significantly more likely to report that girls were better in this skill than boys (p<.05)."}, {"section_title": "A Note on the Spanish Translation", "text": "The purpose of instrument translation is to produce instruments that maintain equivalence of measurement across languages, to achieve a functionally equivalent and culturally appropriate version of the original instruments. In the case of instrument translations into Spanish, one concern is to produce a translated version that works equally well for people speaking different national varieties or dialects of Spanish. The parent interview was translated into Spanish by Research Support Services. When the specifications for the question wording and response options were stable in English, they were downloaded from the Hatteras survey system into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and provided to Research Support Services. At Research Support Services, translations were carried out under the supervision of Alis\u00fa Schoua-Glusberg, an expert in instrument translation into Spanish for health and social research. She followed a committee approach, in which three translators work simultaneously and independently, translating the items. After they completed their translations, they met to reconcile discrepancies, and agreed on a version that combined the best of their independent translations. This -reconciliation\u2016 meeting was chaired by Schoua-Glusberg who acted as a referee in the team discussions. The committee was made of translators who are native speakers of some of the main varieties of Spanish spoken in the United States and included a Mexican, a Puerto Rican, and a South American translator. The translations produced by the committee were suitable for the wider Latino population of the United States. When the translation was returned to RTI, the spreadsheet was uploaded into the Hatteras survey system. Two bilingual telephone interviewers tested the translated interview.

Parents were asked to identify their own job and the job of their spouse or partner. Parents who had completed a bachelor's degree were asked to report their field of study for their most advanced degree. Field of study was also coded for the respondent's spouse or partner. Coders first entered text to describe the occupation or the field of study. Coders were presented with a customized list of occupations or fields of study based on the text string they entered. Coders could choose one of the options listed, or choose -none of the above.\u2016 In the occupation coding application, selecting -none of the above\u2016 presented the coder with a set of three sequential dropdown menus, each with choices increasing in their level of specificity. The first dropdown menu contained a general list of occupations. The options presented in the second dropdown were dependent on the code selected in the first. Some selections from the second dropdown required coders to make a selection from a third even more detailed dropdown menu. In the field of study coding application, selecting -none of these\u2016 brought the coder to a twotiered dropdown menu that operated like the triple dropdown menu of occupations. For both the occupation and field of study coders, interviewers were provided coding guides and trained to use probing techniques to assist in the online coding process. Self-administered web respondents were provided supporting text on screen. However, because, overwhelmingly, the field test cases were done in computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI), modality (web versus CATI) is not distinguished in the table below. Coding experts evaluated coding quality. A 10 percent sample of the pairs of verbatim strings and codes was selected for analysis. Expert coders who were unaware of the codes selected during the interview evaluated the verbatim strings and assigned codes. Cases were not coded when the verbatim string lacked sufficient clarity or specificity. Table 42 shows the results of the recode analysis overall and for each coding system. Overall, 62 percent of the codes selected during the interview were determined to be correct. Coding accuracy ranged from 51 percent for spouse/partner's occupation to 69 percent for respondent's field of study. Coding accuracy was greater when the respondents were reporting on their own occupation or field of study than when reporting for their spouse or partner. Also, coding accuracy was greater for fields of study than for occupations. Taken together, about 11 percent of the text strings were too vague to evaluate. When the respondent was providing data for his or her spouse or partner by proxy, the text strings tended to be less specific. More of the occupation text strings were deemed too vague to recode by the expert coder than the field of study text strings. These results are best characterized as unsatisfactory. Although overall the rate of uncodables was about 11 percent in the HSLS:09 field test, a reasonable comparison point-ELS:2002 occcupation and field of study coding-shows a rate of 1.9 percent in CATI (1.3 percent in web mode) and also shows a percent original code correct of 82 percent in CATI (Ingels et al. 2007, table 51). ELS:2002 results are similar to recode results obtained by RTI for the NCES postsecondary studies. It is uncertain why recoding results for HSLS:09 were subpar. One possibility is that the results are an artifact of having a small sample, which was not representative, and may, by chance, have been extremely unrepresentative. Another possibility is poor interviewer performance. For ELS:2002 and the postsecondary studies, specialized training was provided on how to use the coding systems. This was not done for the HSLS:09 field test because the telephone interviewers had each been trained at some point for one of the other NCES studies. Nonetheless, the telephone interviewers might have benefitted from a refresher training. Although results may reflect atypical characteristics of the sample, just to be sure that coding reaches the proper level, the recommendation is that HSLS:09 main study telephone interviewers be given specialized coding training, regardless of whether they have been trained before."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 9.", "text": "Survey Control System and Data Processing"}, {"section_title": "System Design, Development, and Testing", "text": "All systems were designed and developed to test systems in smaller scope for the field test in preparation for the main study.

Hatteras provided specification, programming, and testing interfaces for the HSLS:09 field test instruments. Hatteras provided the tools and user interface for developing interview specifications. Specific capabilities of the Hatteras system allowed users to review skip logic and item documentation and to search a library of survey items. Once the web survey had been programmed, testers could enter comments into Hatteras, which included a comprehensive comment tracking system to ensure resolution. Hatteras also facilitated importing and exporting information associated with instrument development. For simple instrument questions and items, Hatteras automatically translated specifications into web page scripts when the web page was called to executable form for directly rendering content during survey execution. For questions involving complex routing, varying question and response content, or unusual page layout or behavior, programmers entered custom programming code (hypertext transfer markup language [HTML], Javascript, and C#.NET script) into the Hatteras custom code interface. This code was stored in the SQL Server database along with the instrument specifications for compilation by the instrument execution instrument. The Hatteras system's survey execution engine allowed immediate testing of specification and code content as it was entered and updated, displaying web content as respondents would see it.

New ground was broken for the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) high school cohort longitudinal studies in data collection method-an in-school administration with computerized student questionnaires and assessments rather than the traditional paper-and-pencil instruments. Nor was innovation limited to the student survey because parents (some of the time) and (most of the time) school staff (teachers, principals, and counselors) completed web-based surveys. The traditional paper documents were not used even in follow-up, which comprised computer-assisted telephone interviews for those who did not provide a web-survey response. Although the computerization of the base-year data collection presented technical and logistical challenges, these were overcome, and the field test demonstrated the viability of its new approach. The HSLS:09 field test also differed from the four prior cohort studies in the amount of new material that was tested. Although earlier studies often drew heavily on items from the National Assessment of Educational Progress and other national assessments, it was determined that few existing items fit the HSLS:09 algebraic reasoning framework's requirements. In consequence, of the 264 mathematics items employed in the field test, 234 were newly written specially for HSLS:09. Similarly, a large part of the student content was new, reflecting in part the volume of extra items that were fielded, but also reflecting the fact that the move to a ninth-grade fall starting point freed the study of the need to repeat some trend items that had lost overriding relevance outside their time-series comparison context. The difference in content also reflects a shift of emphasis. The aim of this shift is to obtain more complete data on influences on student motivation and choice in relation to critical actors such as parents and teachers and peers. Further, HSLS:09 seeks to pursue this theme with a well-developed STEM context. A major intensification of focus for the HSLS:09 is, therefore, to maximize the amount of useful data gathered about student interests, motivation, and choice. These subtle shifts in emphasis and purpose had a strong impact on the questionnaires and marked a departure from prior studies. In addition, the counselor questionnaire was the first in the study series since High School and Beyond in 1984. A number of new questions were asked in the parent, administrator, and teacher surveys, to contextually support the theme of student choice behaviors and learning in science and mathematics. Thus in both data collection design and instrument content, HSLS:09 innovated, attempting to preserve what was best in prior studies but also extending NCES into new areas. Securing the cooperation of school districts and schools is always a challenge. Multilevel longitudinal studies are especially burdensome. In the context of the 2008-09 and 2009-10 school years, however, this challenge has grown, largely owing to demanding state and federal assessment requirements. One of the lessons of the field test was the need for more tools to help recruit schools. One very important tool is the ability to return data to individual schoolsespecially a school's assessment scores, with comparison to national norms and major groupings of schools (for example, by sector and region). A second important tool would be the ability to pay the information technology specialist an honorarium. Given use of the school's hardware and facilities, technical assistance from such individuals is critical if computer-assisted in-school sessions are to be successful. Finally, attention should be paid to a unique and promising feature of HSLS:09, agreement and funding for which became available only after the field test was well underway. This is the linkage of longitudinal administrative data from selected states with HSLS:09 statelevel data (in many cases, with augmented school samples, to increase the precision of state estimates using HSLS:09 data). Apart from effecting the records linkage itself, all aspects of this cooperative effort with the states-recruiting, data collection, and data preparation and processing-will draw directly on the knowledge and experience gained in the HSLS:09 field test."}, {"section_title": "Target Universe and Sampling Frames", "text": "The target population for the HSLS:09 full-scale study consists of 9th grade students in public and private schools that include 9th and 11th grades; their parents; and corresponding math and science teachers, school administrators, and high school counselors. (School eligibility in the field test sample, however, is based on schools that have both a 9 th and 12 th grade, since fall 12 th graders are a psychometric proxy for the spring 11 th graders of the HSLS:09 first followup.) The needed respondent samples will be selected from all public and private schools with 9th and 11th grades in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. 1 Excluded from the target universe will be specialty schools such as Bureau of Indian Affairs schools, special education schools for people with disabilities, area vocational schools that do not enroll students directly, and schools for the dependents of U.S. personnel overseas. The primary sampling units (PSU) of schools for this study will be selected from the two databases of the U.S. Department of Education. The Common Core of Data (CCD) will be used for selection of public schools, while private schools will be selected from the Private School Survey (PSS) universe files. To eliminate overlap between the field test and full-scale study samples, the full-scale study sample of schools will be selected prior to the field test sample. However, the early selected full-scale study sample will be -refreshed\u2016 by a small supplemental sample of schools that will become eligible in the time between the administration of the field test and of the full-scale study.

Given that these two sample sources provide comprehensive listings of schools, and that CCD and PSS data files have been used as school frames for a number of other school-based surveys, it is particularly advantageous to use these files in HSLS:09 for comparability and standardization across NCES surveys. As mentioned earlier, the survey population for the full-scale study of HSLS:09 consists of all ninth-graders in the 50 states and District of Columbia enrolled in A-3 \uf0b7 regular public schools, including state department of education schools, that include 9th and 11th grades; and \uf0b7 Catholic and other private schools that have 9th and 11th grades.

As illustrated in table 10, the starting sample of selected schools will be proportional to the number of ninth-grade students within each stratum, based on information from the CCD and PSS. When enrollment information was unavailable for certain schools, missing enrollment counts was imputed as the median value of the enrollment for ninth-graders within race/ethnicity categories in each school stratum.

For this purpose, frame comparison will be conducted between the 2005-2006CCD and the 2006-2007 CCD to determine the frequency of new public high schools. Moreover, districts associated with the refresher subsample of schools will be contacted to identify eligible schools recently opened in their jurisdiction. The districts will be provided with a list of all public schools on the sampling frame in their district to help them identify the appropriate schools. Analogous activities will be carried out for private schools using available information from relevant sources such as Quality Education Data (QED), since the 2006-2007 version of the PSS will not be available in time for refreshing the sample of private schools. However, there is a possibility that NCES will be able to secure an early release copy of the next PSS to include in this investigation. Should such a copy be available, it will be used for sample refreshing and related quality control activities. Obviously, a sample size larger than 800 schools is necessary to compensate for the anticipated nonresponse and ineligibility. As per NCES standards, a weighted response rate of at least 70 percent at the school level will be targeted. In unweighted terms, this means that a sample of size 1,143 schools will be required to secure 800 (or, 1,143 \uf0b4 0.7) participating schools. Based on experience with the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002(ELS:2002, about 4 percent of sampled schools will emerge as ineligible for this study. Consequently, the projected size for the starting sample will be 1,190 (or, 1,143 \u00d7 1.04) schools. Moreover, based on ELS:2002 response rates, the expectation is that an additional sample of 159 schools will be needed to secure 800 participating schools, for a grand total of 1,349 (or, 1,190 + 159) schools. School recruitment activities will be closely monitored and additional schools will be released as needed to ensure that the goal of 800 participating schools is reached. To this end, in addition to the above sample of 1,349 schools, a reserve pool of 251 schools will be selected should observed yield rates fall below expectations. Operationally, the entire sample of 1,600 (or, 1,349 + 251) schools will be randomly partitioned within each stratum into two release pools and a reserve pool. The two release pools will compose the basic sample of 1,349 schools, and schools in the second pool will be released in waves as needed to achieve the sample size goal. The reserve pool will be released selectively in waves by simple random sampling within stratum for strata with low yield rates, when necessary. Once the school sample has been selected, data from QED will be used to obtain principal and district superintendent names along with related information that will be needed for contacting schools. Contacted schools will be asked to provide student rosters for those expected to participate in the field test and the full-scale study, accordingly. For refusing schools, an abbreviated questionnaire will be used to obtain important school-characteristic data to complement frame information. The resulting information will enable a more effective analysis of nonresponse bias."}, {"section_title": "Field Test School Sample", "text": "Using probability-based selection of the full-scale study sample of 1,600 schools from the complete CCD and PSS sampling frames, sample schools will be removed from the frames so that a purposive sample can be selected from among the remaining schools to yield 55 participating schools for the field test study. This sample will be divided into 44 public and 11 private schools and will be selected from schools that have both 9th and 12th grades in the states of New York, California, Florida, Illinois, and Texas. To the extent possible, the stratification plan to be used for selection of this sample will be similar to the one used for the full-scale study sample. Given the small sample size for the field test, however, a somewhat coarser stratification might become necessary to avoid empty strata. As illustrated in table 11, a slightly larger sample of 84 schools will be selected to ensure that at least 50 schools will provide student lists for the field test. Moreover, an additional sample of 20 schools will be selected and kept in a reserve pool should yield rates fall below expectations.  "}, {"section_title": "b.

Moreover, a backup option will allow schools to provide their student lists via e-mail of zipped/password-protected files. If the school cannot provide electronic lists, paper lists will be requested to be faxed to a fax machine in a locked room. For data security reasons, it will be requested that paper lists not be mailed. Each sample school will be asked to provide the following information for each eligible student: Race/ethnicity will be needed to guide oversampling of minority students. Moreover, race/ethnicity along with gender and IEP indicators often serve as effective variables for nonresponse adjustments in the full-scale study. No students will be excluded from the sampling frame because of disabilities or language problems. Specifically, the HSLS:09 field test and full-scale study will include students with severe mental disabilities, those with limited command of the English language for understanding the survey materials, and students with physical or emotional problems. Schools will identify such students from those sampled and identify possible accommodations for these students to complete the survey and assessment. Students who cannot complete the survey or cognitive tests will be excused from doing so; however, contextual information about such students will be collected from teachers, principals, high school counselors, and parents. The student lists will be reviewed for quality, and schools whose lists fail the quality checks will be recontacted by the school recruiter to resolve observed discrepancies. 2 Selecting sample students will proceed when confirmation has been obtained that the list received is correct or when corrected list is received. Students will be sampled on a flow basis as student lists are received. The lists will be stratified by race/ethnicity and select a systematic sample of students from the resulting lists. For schools that provide paper lists, a two-stage process will be used that has been used effectively to select systematic samples from paper lists.

Instead, only information for sampled students will be data-entered."}, {"section_title": "Field Test Student Sample", "text": "A random sample of 29 students from the 9th grade and 30 students from the 12th grade will be selected in each of the 55 sample schools, for a total of 1,595 (or, 55 \uf0b4 29) students in 9th grade and 1,650 (55 x 30) students in 12th grade.

This sample has grown from the original design of 50 schools and 25 students per grade to ensure that the sample size is adequate for needs of the field test math assessment and has been further increased from 55 schools and 27 students per grade to ensure adequate sample size.

One math and one science teacher will be selected for each ninth-grade student. Where sample students have more than one math or science teacher in fall 2008, one of the teachers will be randomly sampled. On the other hand, a number of sample students may not have any math and/or science teachers-a possible reflection of block scheduling-so such students will have no sample teacher. Moreover, for each sample school there will be one sample high school counselor. Where there is more than one counselor at the school, the lead/head/senior counselor will be selected to be in the sample. Experience with this procedure in previous NCES studies, such as the HS&B Administrator and Teacher Survey, suggests that the senior counselors are the most familiar with the school's counseling infrastructure. If this counselor declines to respond, a different counselor, if available, will be substituted. Lastly, for each sample student there will be one sample parent.

Moreover, this base sample will be augmented by selecting 1,800 additional Asian/Pacific Islander students for a total sample of 21,800 students. 3 This augmentation is required to ensure that this subpopulation meets the minimum sample size needed to achieve the following general precision requirements: \uf0b7 detect a 15 percent change in proportions across waves of the study; \uf0b7 detect a 5 percent change in means; \uf0b7 produce relative standard errors of 10 percent or less for proportion estimates based on data from a single wave of data collection; and A-10 \uf0b7 produce relative standard errors of 2.5 percent or less for estimated means based on data from a single wave of data collection.

Plan and Purposes", "text": "RTI's HSLS:09 contract was formally modified in 2008 to support design and implementation of a pre-field-test pilot testing program to (1) examine student response to the mathematics item pool as delivered in an electronic format and (2) evaluate the computerized testing system itself under diverse natural conditions. Facets of the assessment to be evaluated in the pilot included the administration of the computerized test, the feasibility of the data collection methods, logistical issues to consider in preparation for the field test, amount of time spent on the test and items, intensity of testtaker effort, flow of test administration, and students' cognitive responses to test procedures and items. In the original plan, the pilot was to be implemented as a single phase of activity in a total of five schools. However, the original plan was modified such that the implemented plan was a pilot in two phases. In phase 1, RTI visited four schools to conduct pilot tests of the math assessment prototype using the live disc. Participating students were then debriefed at the end of the sessions. In phase 2, RTI contacted school personnel at four schools to ask them to test out the CD in computer labs in their schools. More specifically, the implemented plan for the pilot specified the following Phase 1 and Phase 2 activities: \uf0b7 In Phase 1, test a bootable-CD approach (with Linux-based operating system on the CD) if school equipment is available \uf0b7 Evaluate feasibility vis-\u00e0-vis: \uf0b7 Whether the requisite equipment is in working order and available \uf0b7 Whether assessors can boot from CDs to bypass the computer's operating system \uf0b7 Whether the bootable-CD approach works on the network-access card/equipment at the school \uf0b7 Bandwidth testing --whether there are performance issues \uf0b7 Include a test of bringing laptop PCs to the school \uf0b7 Evaluate: \uf0b7 Whether there are any difficulties with setting up the equipment such as access to power sources, desks/tables to put the laptops on, etc. \uf0b7 Other issues \uf0b7 Recruit 4 schools --and up to 9 9th graders per school --to test the math assessment prototype \uf0b7 Schools should be diverse in terms of urbanicity and income or SES levels of families of the student, if practical to do so \uf0b7 The IT feasibility of school-based computers should be evaluated at all of the recruited schools, including those using laptop PCs for the actual prototype testing with students \uf0b7 The on-site observation and evaluation team should be broadly based, and include, at minimum, the RTI project director, principal investigator, instrument programming task leader, and data collection task leader; the AIR assessment development director; and the NCES project officer. \uf0b7 Beyond the 4 schools recruited for the Phase 1 evaluation of the prototype, RTI, in Phase 2 of the pilot, pursued telephone/mail contacts with a further 4 schools to have them test the feasibility of the bootable-CD approach at their schools-no personal visits would take place in these schools."}, {"section_title": "II. Findings", "text": "Phase 1 Findings: Pilot testing HSLS Live CD in four high schools"}, {"section_title": "Overview", "text": "Testing the computerized assessment in the four pilot schools was a generally very positive experience. The live discs and laptops worked at every site and students were enthusiastic about taking a test by computer rather than paper and pencil. Overall our impression is that a computerized assessment is an effective and user-friendly system that works in varied and complex environments. Most students were able to complete the 10 minute pilot test with little to no technical difficulty and in a timely manner. This speaks to the prospect for a successful field test this fall.\nWe arrived at 9am, one hour before the session was to start, and there was a power outage at the school. In meeting and talking with the Principal, we decided to leave and come back a little while before the session. The room wouldn\"t be available until 10am anyway. We left and returned at about 9:45am. Once we arrived in the room, there were several issues to work through before we could begin. Below is an overview of those issues and some general information about the session. \uf0b7 There were 13 computers in the lab \uf0b7 There were 9 students in the session \uf0b7 It took about 20-30 minutes for the three of us to begin the test. We began about 10:20. At that time we had o 6 students using laptops (2 boys and 4 girls) o 3 students using desktops (2 boys and 1 girl) \uf0b7 Prior to the test, the internet connection had to be reestablished since the power outage. The principal informed us that one of their servers had to re-boot. \uf0b7 The computers were a little slow to re-boot, which was also an issue when we had to re-boot them with the live discs. \uf0b7 Once the computers were up, some internet connections worked some did not \uf0b7 Some computer cables had to be reconnected. (Students were plugging and unplugging cables on a couple of computers as we first arrived in the room) \uf0b7 The desktop computers in the lab were several years old (2000 based on the sticker on the computer) \uf0b7 The monitors were small, one was 13\" the others were 15\" (estimate). \uf0b7 The fonts were large, 640x480 (estimate), this made considerable horizontal and vertical scrolling was necessary. The following issues were a result of the small monitors and or the large font size: \uf0b7 Presentation of content on the screen did not adjust for smaller screen size \uf0b7 The \"time remaining\" information was not visible. Desktop users were not able to tell how much time was remaining until the 3 minute remaining dialog box appeared \uf0b7 The calculator took up approximately 40-45% of the screen, which made it harder for students to navigate the test. The screen size probably did not create issues with the calculator, but contributed to the horizontal and vertical scrolling \uf0b7 The questions were displayed with horizontal scrolling in addition to the vertical scrolling. \uf0b7 The yellow bar when displayed with horizontal scrolling was blocking the horizontal scrolling \uf0b7 Final review screen buttons were not aligned \uf0b7 We also observed one student dealing with the 3-minute-remaining dialogue box by trying to answer a question rather than click the \"ok\" button. Once that was unsuccessful, the student clicked the \"ok\" button instead. Should we consider allowing any selection to remove the dialogue box --as well as the \"ok\" button --(if that's possible) \uf0b7 As we were working to boot up the machines, a couple had to be reconfigured to boot from the CD drive (those machines were configured back to their original settings). We noticed that a few machine were configured to boot from CD drive as a last bootable option and so never booted from CD, Also some computers were set with an F2 function key to see the boot option. \uf0b7 One computer\"s disc drive did not work, another computer\"s \"S\" key did not work so that student could not enter the proxy server name \uf0b7 During the debriefing, one student seemed to do much of the talking. About 4-5 of the students said at least one thing, while the others did not comment during the debriefing section. After we read the instructions, the students began the assessment. After the test, we set up chairs in a circle and began the debriefing. This set up seemed to facilitate a good discussion.\nWe arrived at 2pm, one hour before the session. We were met in the office by the person who was coordinating logistics at the school. She signed us in, gave us visitor badges and walked us to the computer lab where we met the technology person. He helped us set up. We brought in 4 or 5 laptops but only set up two. We didn\"t end up using laptops at all. We used 8 desktops for all 8 students. A group of three students came in around 3:15. Then another five came arrived about 10 minutes later. At that time, were ready and began reading the instructions at about 3:25-3:30. One question that has emerged in completing these pilot tests is will it be enough to have only Session Administrator (possibly alone) to set up the session? Some points about the session and the set up: \uf0b7 There were 32 desktop computers in the media lab (media lab doubled as a library): Computers were all Pentium 4, 512-1gb RAM, all with Windows XP Pro and Service Pack 2 \uf0b7 School is in the process of implementing a one-to-one student to computer ratio, mostly Macs. We were told there are carts that each hold 40 G4 Macs. The school has wireless throughout and we saw a number of students sitting in different parts of the media lab/library on their laptops. Though the desktops we used in the media lab were PCs and were not connected by wireless. \uf0b7 It was agreed that we will have live discs for Macs during the field test \uf0b7 There were 8 students in the session (4 boys and 4 girls) \uf0b7 It took about 15 minutes for the three of us to get set up. We set up two laptops but did not end up using them \uf0b7 There was a staff meeting at the same time as the session, though it was in another part of library and we didn\"t seem to disturb each other at all. \uf0b7 All eight students were freshman \uf0b7 There were no questions before we began the test \uf0b7 The screen resolution was good on the desktops. There were no issues with screen or font size or resolution. Everything was visible and easy to navigate After we read the instructions, the students began the assessment. During the test we set up chairs in a semi-circle for the debriefing. All of the students completed the assessment before the 10 minutes were up. One raised his hand \uf0b7 Concern was expressed over the ordering of the administration of the survey questionnaire and the assessment. The proposal presented to the panel is to have the survey first, followed by the assessments. The following concerns were expressed: 1. Some were concerned that students may not perform as well as they could on the assessments because they are tired from completing the questionnaire. Also, answers to questions (e.g., race/ethnicity) may have a priming effect on the assessments. 2. It was mentioned that the priming effect could occur on the questionnaire if the assessments were administered first. For example, if the student performed poorly on the assessment, then their answers on the questionnaire could be influenced. 3. One alternative mentioned was to administer the demographic and critical questionnaire items first, then administer the assessments, and conclude with the remaining questionnaire items. 4. Another recommendation was to divide the session into two 45-minute blocks and allow parents and/or students to choose which class period(s) to forgo to take part in HSLS:09 (e.g., study hall, physical education). Concern was expressed about adding burden on the school with this approach. 5. It was suggested that different orderings could be tested during the field test (e.g., survey first, then assessment; or assessment first, then survey, etc.) \uf0b7 Don Rock recommended adding some questions at the 7 th grade level because at the beginning of 9 th grade, students are still essentially 8 th graders. Need 7 th grade items to distinguish the lowest achievers. \uf02d Be sensitive to overall floor and ceiling and the ability to estimate change \uf02d Concern was expressed about using the schools' computers. A suggestion was made to try to avoid technical problems by bringing laptops to schools."}, {"section_title": "Setting up for each session", "text": "One challenge was setting up for each session in a timely manner. Each pilot school had at least 3 people who were somewhat familiar with how CDs function. Two of the four schools had the opportunity to test the CD before the pilot test. Still it took all of us 10-25 minutes to get the sessions fully ready for the students. To address this uncertainty, session administrators will be fully trained on the CDs functionality, and we will send CDs to the school coordinators in advance of the session and ask them to test it in their labs before we arrive."}, {"section_title": "Adapting to technical specifications and other complexities at each site", "text": "Another challenge was to apply the technical specifications and address the complexities that occurred at each site. For example, at one of the pilot test schools there was a blackout that occurred just before the observation team arrived and the school's internet connection was slow to boot up. Also, in trying to help, some of the students disconnected some of the cables in the back of the computers and that had to be fixed. The observation team was able to resolve these issues and conduct a test session on time with 6 students on laptops and 3 students on desktops. Based on these uncertainties, we are designing the field test operations to be as flexible as possible. The plan to flexibly accommodate various circumstances includes these four measures: 1. Make the discs easily usable on different operating systems with varied internet protocols; 2. Provide clear instructions for what to do with all known internet protocol scenarios; 3. Provide support for direct telephone access to IT specialists to help with set up; and, 4. Send discs to the school coordinator before test day to check the functionality (when possible)"}, {"section_title": "Instructions and General Impressions", "text": "Students generally felt the instructions were clear and the directions for the computer test were good.

Some indicated that they are not used often, so many students would not be familiar with them. Also, allowing the use of a graphing calculator could be an equity issue if some students have used them and others have not. \uf02d Some wondered what the correlation is between understanding math concepts and how well a student uses a graphing calculator. \uf02d It was pointed out that if students are not allowed to use graphing calculators in 9 th grade, but are then allowed to use them in 11 th grade, the 9 th -11 th grade linking items would no longer be comparable. \uf02d It was noted that the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) allows the use of 4-function calculators. \uf0b7 The recommendation from the majority of the panel was not to use graphing calculators with the 9 th grade test (the assumption is that even if used at 11 th grade, no 11 th grade test items requiring or benefiting from graphing calculators will appear on the 9 th grade assessment). \uf0b7 There was no clear consensus on allowing use of a graphing calculator in 11 th grade. It was suggested that an experiment in the field test may be helpful in determining the best approach. \uf0b7 A middle-ground alternative supported by some was to allow the use of a 4-function calculator in both the 9 th and 11 th grades. \uf0b7 There was a question as to what incentive students have to take the test seriously. \uf0b7 Concern was raised about a ceiling effect given the small number of items. The concern was that the test in 11 th grade may not show much growth, especially for those pursuing STEM. \uf0b7 Concern was raised about being able to make distinctions at the lowest levels. Items that apply algebra to real-life situations are needed. \uf0b7 Don Rock indicated that since the math test would be adaptive, one minute per item was reasonable because students would be getting items appropriate for their level. \uf0b7 There was a question about the race/ethnicity/gender of the math advisory group and the item writers. Concern was raised about the items, given the lack of racial/ethnic diversity of the math advisory group. It was noted that the item writers were racially diverse. Also, men and women are both well represented among the advisory group and item writers. \uf0b7 Three other possibilities that remove the measurement error and could potentially be used with HSLS:09 are: (1) plausible values (using Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study [TIMSS], NAEP methodology), (2) Marginal Maximum Likelihood (NAAL Methodology), and (3) Murray Aitkin's 4-level hierarchical linear model. \uf0b7 Don Rock expects that scores with a 2-stage adaptive math test would be as reliable as NAEP's plausible values because there are more items per student and the selection of items is based on a routing test. \uf0b7 RTI needs to determine what statistical analysis will be used.\n\uf0b7 Don Rock recommended starting off with the easiest items. \uf0b7 Instructions about when to leave a question blank and when to guess need to be carefully written in order to maximize the number of items completed. \uf0b7 The following concerns were expressed about the use of a graphing calculator: \uf02d will the calculator impact the amount of time allotted for the test?; \uf02d will the calculator create an expectation on how/if students will use the calculator?; \uf02d the test should include a direction along the lines of -a calculator may help you to answer these questions, feel free to use one if you wish\u2016. \uf0b7 Language in the instructions needs to reflect that students are not required to use the calculator.\n\uf0b7 Insert a question for the student and parent questionnaire that asks if parents use math/science on the job. \uf0b7 Family structure domain \uf02d Panelists did not understand what was meant by -change in family situation.\u2016 \uf02d Panelists want information on divorce, whether there is a parent outside the home involved in the student's life, and death of a parent. \uf02d It was suggested that change in family structure between the 9 th grade and the 11 th grade surveys can be measured by comparing household rosters and asking for reasons a parent is no longer in the household. This approach has been used in ECLS. \uf02d It was recommended that a question about the number of people in a household be added. \uf0b7 Demographic characteristics domain \uf02d Concern was expressed that undocumented immigrants may not want to answer questions about immigrant status. \uf0b7 Socioeconomic Status domain \uf02d Some panelists wanted to ask parents (and students) how much they use math and science in their job. Others were concerned that parents who use very basic math (e.g., cashiers) would say they use it a lot. These items are candidates for cognitive testing. \uf02d A panelist suggested asking college graduates from which college they received their degree. \uf02d The value of the question about assets greater than $10,000 was questioned. It is used on postsecondary studies because it is one variable used to calculate expected family contribution for financial aid. Panelists agreed that $10,000 was too low. \uf0b7 Previous educational experiences domain \uf02d The questions about behavior problems need a time period as a frame of reference. The past year was suggested. Also, it would be more helpful to know how many times the school contacted the parent about a behavior problem rather than whether they did or did not. \uf02d There was some debate about the merit of the question about stopping out of high school. Some panelists thought it was more important to have an estimate of the number of days absent although other panelists indicated that parents may not know if their teenager is skipping school. Others thought the stopout question was more appropriate for the 11 th grade questionnaire. \uf02d The question about academic classes outside of school should refer to science and math. A distinction should also be made between remedial and enrichment. \uf02d The question about tutoring should be expanded to include Saturday academies, learning centers, and after school programs. Need information on the subjects studied in these programs and whether they were remedial or for enrichment. \uf0b7 Current education/activities domain \uf02d Must ask about whether the student has an IEP even if in a Gifted and Talented program \uf02d There was some debate about whether parents should be asked whether their 9 th grader has a disability. Some thought the question was too subjective, but others thought the parent's perception was important. Also, some said that students with disabilities may not have an IEP. \uf02d Some wanted to know what disability the parent believed the teenager had, while others just wanted to know whether it was a learning disability. \uf02d The wording of the question about exchanging knowledge with other parents needs to be simplified. It was suggested that HSLS ask parents how often they talk with other parents about classes, schools, and teachers. \uf02d There was some discussion about whether the question should be limited to discussions with parents of the student's friends in keeping with Coleman's concept of social closure. But since the friends may attend other schools than the 9 th grader, a more general question was suggested. \uf02d The question about conversations with other parents should not be limited to advice. Many parents may be willing to exchange helpful information but not comfortable advising other parents. Or acknowledging receipt of advice \uf02d Throughout the domain, refer to the past year \uf0b7 School choice \uf02d -Career academies\u2016 should be -Career and technical programs\u2016 \uf0b7 Parent-school relationship domain \uf02d Parents recommended cutting the question about frequency of contact with school teachers and counselors because it will be too early in the school year to be meaningful. Also, the question does not capture why the parent is talking to the teacher. \uf02d Panelists recommended splitting the question about requesting a particular teacher or course into two questions. \uf02d Panelists thought it was more important to know if the parent know what math and science course the student is taking in 9 th grade than in the next school year. If ask this question, ask them for the course name (verbatim), not just yes or no. \uf02d The panelists suggested eliminating the question about satisfaction with teachers because it will be too early in the school year for them to assess this. \uf0b7 Home environment domain \uf02d Consider adding a question about what subjects the student prefers \uf073 Some panelists suggested adding question about whether the parent encourages the student in some subjects more than others, but there was also concern about social desirability biases with such a question \uf02d Some panelists suggested considering adding the question from NELS about decision-making to characterize parenting style. Others did not think this was a priority given the limited length of the interview.\n\n\uf0b7 Remove the school size and grade span construct; that information may be found in the CCD, which in future will be more timely than in the past. \uf0b7 Ask the department chair (if surveyed) about student/teacher ratios. \uf0b7 Include a question that asks about the length of the school day and class period. \uf0b7 Include an item on teacher absenteeism. \uf0b7 Teacher staff characteristics domain \uf02d In the staffing construct, remove the -do you find that it is easier to hire qualified math teachers and science teachers if they WHO? enter alternative certification programs?\u2016 \uf02d Insert the word -district\u2016 at the top of page 4. \uf02d In the qualifications construct, remove a -successfully completed postsecondary period\u2016 from the -what are the requirements for employment as a full-time math teacher in your school\u2016 item. \uf02d In the qualifications construct, remove a -successfully completed postsecondary period\u2016 from the -what are the requirements for employment as a full-time science teacher in your school\u2016 item. \uf02d Remove the first two items under the retention/turnover construct. In remaining items, change -this year\u2016 to -last year\u2016. This survey had no page # so refresh uswhat's this about? \uf02d In the last question in the retention construct, insert the option \u2017left teaching' or \u2017retired'. \uf0b7 School, policies, practices and programs domain \uf02d Remove the flexibility of course assignment practices construct; the counselor is asked that question. \uf02d For the last question in the accountability construct, remove the phrase -when a student fails a competency test\u2016. \uf02d Remove the first item in the extracurricular activities offered construct. Add the following options to the second item: -career exploration and internship programs\u2016 and -tutoring opportunities\u2016. \uf02d For the dropout prevention program, include a question that asks how many schools are transferred out into alternative programs. \uf02d Include a question that asks how schools support struggling students. \uf02d Include a question that asks how schools support students who excel. \uf02d In the next to last item under transition construct, remove the -full or part time\u2016 from the item.

One study mentioned paid schools $1,200 to $1,500. Another study mentioned found that $1,000 is greatly appreciated by urban schools, but not as much by suburban schools in more affluent communities. \uf02d A panelist recommended giving the $500 incentive to the math department. \uf0b7 One suggestion is to consider offering school-level results as an incentive for schools to participate (results should describe how they fit into the national or regional performance even if not school level). \uf02d If offered at the school-level, principal would need to agree not to distribute the information outside the school to comply with regulations. \uf02d Concern was expressed that parents may be disinclined to let their student participate if they know that this information would be shared with the school. Parents would need to be notified. Also, results may bias performance in 11 th grade. \uf0b7 There was some question as to how many teachers would respond using the Web survey. The Schools and Staffing Survey found that the Web survey was not used often by teachers. However, more schools have computers now so it may be more successful now. \uf0b7 It was noted that half of Asian students live in second-language households. HSLS:09 needs to translate for these populations, especially given the oversampling of Asians. \uf0b7 It was noted that year-round schools start in July. In these schools, the assessment will be administered 3 months into the school year so these students may have higher scores than students in schools on traditional calendars. \uf0b7 There is a need to plan for multiple sessions in multitrack schools. \uf0b7 One panelist asked if block scheduling had been taken into account when designing the data collection strategy. This is one reason for the 1 \u00bd hour session.\n\uf0b7 Link external data sources that will enrich data without having additional burden on students. \uf0b7 Is there a linkage with state database for student level data? \uf0b7 How will you choose the teachers selected to participate? \uf02d Will you do a census of all math and science teachers? There was a motion to survey all math and science teachers to get a sense of school climate. \uf073 There was an additional suggestion to ask all math teachers, but all have a question about whether they teach 9 th grade and that it would be important to ask the teachers about the class in which they have the student. \uf02d Do they have to be math or science teachers? \uf02d There was a suggestion that it was still important to get the science teachers, even if the science assessment is cancelled. \uf02d Will they be the teachers of the students sampled? \uf0b7 Concerns were expressed that if students cannot be linked to a particular classroom, the value of those type of questions is diminished.\n\uf0b7 RTI agreed to send out a diagram of the conceptual model with a list of domain priorities. The panel members are going to send responses to RTI about the diagram and domains to remove or rethink. \uf0b7 Immigration module issues are the following: \uf02d The question, What is your first language? should be considered. Prepared December 14, 2007 \uf02d Rather than asking about years in the United States, it may be better to ask students what grade they started in school in the United States. \uf02d To measure language domination, it may be better to ask the students how often they speak a specific language with their peers or with their mother. \uf02d The discrimination item should not be just asked of immigrants-if only for immigrants, it should be removed. \uf0b7 9 th grade retention domain: \uf02d Consider including these options -I don't know\u2016 or -my parent made me.\u2016 \uf0b7 Interests and Goals Module: \uf02d Differentiations should be made among aspirations and expectations, ideas, and plans. \uf02d The sequence of the questions are important and should be considered when organizing the instrument. \uf02d The interest and goals section should be decreased because there are too many items. Though Vinetta Jones commented that the attitude questions are key, especially considering that minority students often have fewer opportunities for action \uf02d Include as responses: positive responses, neutral, negative, just don't care \uf02d There is interest in the consistency of expectations across time. \uf02d There is a desire to figure out if students are thinking about the future. \uf02d Rather than asking about the -certainty\u2016 of future plans, it may be better to get at expectations unobtrusively. For example, -What do you plan to do the year after graduation?\u2016 and -Would you be disappointed if you were not a college graduate after age 30?\u2016 \uf02d There was a suggestion that the pair of items about aspirations and expectations from the High School and Beyond study (HS&B) may be better measures than those proposed (used in NELS and ELS). \uf02d Interest in school: \uf073 What are students' perceptions of course offerings? How do students perceive their placement in the school? There is often a dissonance between students' location in the school and the track they are on based on records. \uf073 May need to cut aspirations a bit to make sure we get behavior. Behavior is important from a policy perspective.  November 28-29, 2007Prepared December 14, 2007 \uf0b7 Social and cultural experiences: \uf02d This construct was felt to be redundant with others and they suggested removing it. \uf0b7 Family and home life: \uf02d The panelists felt that all the questions in this construct are high priority. \uf0b7 Positive/negative experiences with STEM: \uf02d Get some STEM-related questions from the National Math Panel. \uf0b7 Remove the regulated learning and locus of control data elements. \uf0b7 Remove the engagement in school item since there are better measures of this. \uf0b7 A question about homework should be included. \uf0b7 Consider reviewing Henry Treisman's study on how Asian and Black students interact with their respective groups; reviewing this might provide more information on the STEM material. 1. Distinguish Southeast Asian from East Asian etc. (cultural identity is key to much of this) \uf0b7 The perceived obstacles construct include items that deal with the obstacles the schools put in the student's way (zero tolerance policies, teacher and counselors, school rules). \uf0b7 For the next meeting you may want to consider how the data will be analyzed.\n\uf0b7 General \uf02d Due to the oversampling of Asian students, consider translating the parent questionnaire into Asian languages, particularly Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese. \uf02d Limit the number of items. One panelist answered all the questions including immigrant questions. It took him 54 minutes to complete. \uf02d Consider adding an item about residential mobility. Refer to the Census' study of migration. \uf02d Consider adding an item that asks if the child participates in a gifted and talented program. \uf02d Consider adding questions about social capital (e.g., whether parent knows friends, parents of friends). \uf02d Consider adding questions about parenting (e.g., monitoring). \uf02d Consider adding a question about how far in school curriculum they want the student to go? How far do they think they will go? D-27 HSLS:09 Technical Review Panel Meeting Summary November 28-29, 200720 Prepared December 14, 2007 \uf02d Consider adding questions about the degree to which parents are informed about the immediate and future paths in high school (e.g., whether a high school preparation night was offered in 8 th grade if the parent went; parent's knowledge of IB, AP, GATE) \uf02d Consider adding question about how parents learn to negotiate the system (e.g., has school done anything to inform them of what their student needs to do to get into a 4year college) and whether they understand the consequences of decisions. \uf02d Consider asking parents about their ideas about coursetaking. \uf0b7 Family structure domain: \uf02d Panelists suggested reducing the number of questions on family structure. Advised to refer to the American Community Survey or ECLS for examples as to how to collect this information efficiently. \uf02d The panelists agreed that family size is important. \uf02d Stability of family structure over time is important. Proposed family structure questions are just a snapshot. \uf02d Consider adding an item that asks for the total number of siblings of the students and student's birth order. \uf02d Distinguishing among full, half, and step-siblings is not important. \uf0b7 Race/ethnicity \uf02d Use the current OMB race/ethnicity categories. \uf02d Consider not asking for Hispanic subgroups if there will not be enough students in each subgroup to be analytically useful. \uf0b7 Language: \uf02d It is important to know if the household is monolingual or bilingual, and if bilingual, what the dominant language is. Language proficiency is also important. \uf02d Some felt the proposed questions work. Others thought there were too many questions on language. \uf02d The absence of the task-oriented language questions (from NELS:88 and ELS:2002) was questioned. \uf0b7 Religion: \uf02d Most panelists recommended eliminating the questions about religious denomination. However, it was noted that analysts may be interested in the religious denomination in the context of school choice (e.g., denomination of students in Catholic private schools). \uf02d Some felt that religiosity is more important than denomination. \uf0b7 Respondent's occupation: \uf02d Interested in getting a sense of whether parent is using STEM on their job. Some thought it was better to ask for parent's opinion. Others were concerned that some parents who use basic math skills (e.g., cashier) may indicate that they use STEM on the job. \uf02d Ask for industry to understand the context of the occupation. \uf02d There was a suggestion to ask immigrants about their occupation in their country of origin. Others felt that the highest level of education and the field in which the degree was earned was all that was needed. \uf0b7 Wealth: \uf02d Recommended using items on wealth from the NCES postsecondary study instead of the proposed items (e.g., assets $10,000 or more). \uf0b7 Stop-out: \uf02d The utility of the item about reasons for dropping out was questioned. \uf0b7 Changing schools: \uf02d The utility of the item about reasons for changing schools was questioned. \uf0b7 Academic classes outside of school: \uf02d The question about whether the student has taken any courses outside of school was considered very important. \uf02d A suggestion was made to add tutoring to the question about education outside of school. \uf0b7 Disability: \uf02d The panelists suggested asking about whether or not the child has ever had an IEP. \uf02d Collect data on the type of disability from the school not the parent. \uf0b7 Siblings as role models: \uf02d For the sibling as role models construct, consider prefacing the questions with the following phrase, -Of the siblings mentioned previously\u2026\u2016 or move this question into the family structure section. \uf0b7 Parent-school relationship: \uf02d The panelists suggested that the focus should be on parent advocacy and knowledge of the appropriate avenues for advocacy \uf073 How does the parent learn to negotiate the school system? \uf073 Does the parent know how to be an effective advocate for his/her child? The question about whether the parent has ever requested a particular teacher speaks to this. Ask why or why not as a follow up to this item. \uf02d Consider limiting the question about requesting a particular teacher or course to the 8 th and 9 th grades; also, consider adding a why or why not follow-up question \uf0b7 Availability/exercise of school choice: \uf02d Consider trimming the school choice section. \uf02d At a bare minimum, want to know if parent chose the school or not. \uf02d Some thought reasons for choosing the school were less important. \uf02d Ask about school satisfaction in the 11 th grade since in the fall of 9 th grade parents may not have an opinion yet. \uf0b7 Parents attitudes about math and science: \uf02d Trim these items. \uf0b7 Religion and science: \uf02d Eliminate the questions about evolution, intelligent design, and global warming. They are off-putting. \uf0b7 Encouragement of STEM careers D-29 HSLS:09 Technical Review Panel Meeting Summary November 28-29, 2007Prepared December 14, 2007 \uf02d pick one class: select class with most 9 th grade students in general such as algebra; if the teacher doesn't teach algebra select geometry. \uf02d classroom practices \uf073 Look at work of Valerie Lee about linkages between achievement and teacher self-reported instructional practices. \uf073 Content versus how it is taught is an important distinction. \uf0b7 Consider adding items about: \uf02d the student's ability to learn; \uf02d the teacher's ability to teach non-English speakers; \uf02d the highest course in math taken by the science teachers; \uf02d school climate (the Schools and Staffing Survey may have items that would work well for this) \uf02d questions such as: -What percentage of your students do you believe will pursue science careers?\u2016 and -Do you think your students like science and math?\u2016 \uf02d textbooks used; \uf02d suspension; \uf02d absenteeism; and \uf02d substitutes with college degrees ( *a question about qualifications of substitutes was also suggested for the school questionnaire)."}, {"section_title": "November 29, 2007", "text": "Instrument Design: Plans and Issues"}, {"section_title": "Steven Ingels", "text": "\uf0b7 HSLS:09 will serve two primary functions: 1.

Some, but still working on technology (e.g., the computer needs an Intel chip to work properly). \uf0b7 Did students have ID and login? Yes. \uf0b7 Live CD use: interviewers inserted disk on PCs, rebooted, and the CD takes over the computer system. Some schools will have to use laptops locally and then the data will be transferred securely. \uf0b7 Problem of collecting parent and teacher list data-schools said it was easier to just give RTI all data for school as opposed to pulling out the specific information needed. One confidentiality concern is giving information out before obtaining parental consent. \uf0b7 Will 8 th grade information be available on high school transcripts? May pose a problem. We know from NELS and ELS that this information can be obtained through high school transcripts, though only 7% of ELS:2002 transcripts included 8 th grade information. More frequent use of electronic records should facilitate this collection. In addition, 8 th grade algebra coursetaking will be collected on the student questionnaire and missing data will be imputed as was done on NELS:88. \uf0b7 It was asked what percentage of parents are not native English speakers? Dan Pratt stated that the parent questionnaires are translated into Spanish, but consent forms and instructions have been translated into additional languages as well. Only a small percentage (6-7%) did not participate due to language barriers. Debbie Herget stated that RTI is working on ideas for obtaining better participation rates. For example, parent contacting information will be collected as part of the initial student list, facilitating an earlier start to the parent data collection. \uf0b7 School coordinator role did not work as well as hoped for distributing materials to and prompting staff, so midway through the field test, RTI started contacting staff directly. This method proved effective and will be used in the main study. RTI is also expecting Prepared February 5, 2009 that parent response rates will increase in the main study and will be linked to student data. \uf0b7 Some parents and staff had problems with pop-up blockers and passwords. \uf0b7 Russ Rumberger, a panelist from the University of California, Santa Barbara, suggested going to monthly county meetings of school districts in California to try to increase participation rates as superintendents talk to each other about topics of mutual interest at these meetings. \uf0b7 Some oversampling of Catholic/private schools, but will be taken care of by weighting. \uf0b7 In order to verify self-reporting of 9 th grade students-ask teachers. Though Dan Pratt claimed that while teacher data are linked to students, in order to keep burden down, the emphasis is not on asking teachers to report on individual students. It was suggested that teachers be asked: -Is it assumed that students taking this course have taken algebra?\u2016 Dan Pratt responded that student level data will link to teacher data including classroom. \n\uf0b7 Theta distribution-don't want to have too much lack of overlap. There was some discussion of this distribution both at the high end (needing discrimination at the top) and also at the low end (to be able to show gain, avoiding a floor effect). \uf0b7 Another issue broached was how 12 router questions are being chosen and whether 12 is the optimal number. \uf0b7 Discussion of router and high/medium/low questions on tests. Gary Phillips says there are two decisions to be made: 1) Which math items should go on router and which should be placed on each level (high/medium/low) of the second-stage of the assessment; and 2) How will cut points (based on patterns of response on the router) be determined for assignment of different levels of the \n\uf0b7 Question asked about how instructions are provided to students.

Suggest: reducing household roster; reducing stem; perhaps verify through parent questionnaire (but what if you don't get that information? Impute?); one concern is that you won't obtain family size-could you obtain from parent questionnaire? \uf0b7 Item 35 on language. Concern over fluency versus frequency. Question doesn't really get to whether students/parents are fluent in English. Could you ask parents? In addition, extra burden of what type of language spoken. \uf0b7 Item 40. One group suggested looking at frequencies in field test results to reduce sets. Another group questioned the use of -church groups\u2016 as opposed to -religious.\u2016 \uf0b7 Item 41. One group recommended deleting the entire item. Others suggested making response options -yes/no\u2016 to save time but then it would be an untested item. Another Recommendations for Parent Questionnaire: \uf0b7 Discussion of where household information might be better gleaned, from parents or from students. RTI expects a coverage rate in the mid-80s for parents. Marilyn Seastrom is not in favor of deleting from student survey. The questions in the parent survey may not really be getting at household composition, and may not satisfactorily address the issue of stability (though this is somewhat addressed in Items 7 and 8). One suggestion was to translate Student Questionnaire Item 31 to the perspective of the adult. \uf0b7 Item 7. Change. \uf0b7 Item 8. Consider changing to -mark all that apply\u2016 with an adjusted stem. \uf0b7 Item 16. Consider adding additional Hispanic categories (e.g., Puerto Rican), like ELS and if changes made in this questionnaire, make consistent with student questionnaire. \uf0b7 Would it be beneficial to ask country or region of origin if not born in the United States? \uf0b7 Changes made to Language section of Student questionnaire should be repeated in Parent questionnaire. \uf0b7 Subtlety of usage/frequency versus fluency. Can you really disentangle without increasing burden? Examine a little more. Options to look at include NHES Parental Involvement Survey, Adult Literacy Survey, and the Department of Education's shorthand list of questions that try to get to ESL need (i.e., -how well do you\u2026\u2016 though these may be too subjective). Item 32 is closer than Item 31 at getting to whether language is a barrier to parental involvement. \uf0b7 Item 35. Change to Associate's and Bachelor's, and include started and completed subitems. Make these changes consistent among all questionnaires. \uf0b7 Item 36. Discussion regarding amplifying this item to include bachelor's levels of education. Also of adding question (to perhaps replace this one): -Do any of your completed degrees \uf0b7 Use clear, familiar contexts: \uf0de Select contexts that are -real world\u2016 and to which students can relate. Avoid contrived contexts and questions. Pose questions that could reasonably be encountered in the workplace, daily life and school settings. \uf0de Consider using tables and diagrams to clarify information when the problem situation involves multiple types of information and/or abstract mathematical contexts. \uf0de Avoid questions in which the description of the problem situation requires a lengthy set-up. NOTE: The item bank and test forms should include items that are set in context-both daily life and formal mathematical. \uf0b7 Use clear, familiar expectations: \uf0de Use -friendly numbers\u2016 when appropriate. For example, limit fractions to those that would commonly be encountered in Algebra books or daily usage. \uf0de Avoid unnecessary steps in a problem situation when those steps are not key to the assessment of the target benchmark; e.g., requiring students to convert cubic feet of sand to pounds of sand when this is not related to the target benchmark being assessed. \uf0de Make sure that questions pose a clear, coherent question or task. Do not ask students to do two different things in two different sentences within an item. Ask the question directly and as concisely as possible. \uf0de If more than one part is required for an answer, identify all components of a question or task, e.g., use an obvious signal (such as a bullet or a paragraph break) to indicate separate components or questions for which a response is expected. \uf0de Include problem situations that can be solved in multiple ways.

For students whose mental or physical disabilities constituted a potential barrier to participation, the following guidelines are offered: \uf0b7 If a student's individualized education program (IEP) indicates that the student should not be tested through standardized pencil-and-paper assessments, the student will not be asked to complete the HSLS:09 assessment battery. \uf0b7 If the student's IEP indicates that the student can be tested with accommodations, and the student is deemed to be capable of taking a computer delivered assessment, the following accommodations are acceptable, if it is possible (in practical terms, in cooperation with the school) to implement them: \uf0b7 extra time; \uf0b7 split session; \uf0b7 instructions in sign language for hearing-impaired students; \uf0b7 one-on-one session (if the student could not participate in group settings)."}, {"section_title": "Test Framework", "text": "The study of algebra occupies well over fifty percent of the time devoted to mathematics at the high school level and has often been cited as being a major pump, or filter, in the pipeline to success in fields of study or occupational preparation. In the study of algebra, students learn to reason with expressions, equations, inequalities, and functions to model and solve problems in linear settings and to investigate nonlinear settings (exponential and quadratic) in order to further their understanding of linear and nonlinear relationships and their applications in mathematics and other subject matter areas. Students' initial contacts with the formal study of algebra provide them with skills and understandings of linear relationships represented in both equation, and function-based, settings. Their understandings and skills grow from working with sequential patterns and formulas to using variables and expressions to describe, investigate, and represent linear and nonlinear relationships. From these experiences they develop strategies for conceptualizing, representing, reasoning, and solving problems involving linear relationships. Symbolically, students recognize that there are many different-but equivalent-representations of expressions, equations, and functions, and that these representations differ in their efficiency in representing, interpreting, or solving a problem depending on the context. Along with the development of the understanding of conceptual foundations for algebra, students must become fluent in applying properties of algebra and in manipulating and translating among different representations of linear situations, as well as between different forms of the same type of representation. As students interpret algebraic expressions relating change (time, speed, distance, and value) their conception of algebraic expressions and the contexts they represent expands to include exponential and quadratic expressions. Comparing and contrasting these expressions and their related equations and functions and their properties allows students to better understand constant rate of change as a defining feature of linearity as well as develop a basis for understanding and interpreting the role of nonlinear functions in future mathematics courses and other disciplines. Continued study of algebra as a field in itself, along with its applications to representing major concepts in analysis, geometry, data analysis, and probability leads to the development of properties and applications of polynomial, exponential, and logarithmic functions. This development and understanding of algebraic relationships and skills helps expand the scope of students' capabilities to apply polynomial, absolute value, rational, radical, logarithmic, and exponential functions-their solutions or zeros, their behavior, and their applications to other situations inside and outside of mathematics. They also develop an understanding and ability to equations and linear inequalities representing mathematical and real-world contexts. Students analyze and explain the reasoning used to solve linear equations and linear inequalities. Nonlinear expressions, equations, and functions. This domain focuses on students' growth from working with simple exponents and their related properties to the development of student capabilities to identify and classify quadratic and other nonlinear relationships (polynomial, exponential, logarithmic) and the sums, differences, products, quotients, and compositions of these. Students should be able to recognize, interpret, and model simple mathematical and realworld phenomena using nonlinear functions and solve equations related to these functions with a variety of techniques. The development of the concepts and properties related to nonlinear equations and functions brings with it the development of new techniques for analyzing and solving the related equations and interpreting the graphs and properties of these functions. Students grow in their understanding of the solutions and zeros and methods of finding them, ranging from factoring and applications of the zero-product property to use of the quadratic formula and interpretation of the roots of quadratic equations. Students develop graphical, numerical, and technology-based methods of finding or estimating the solutions to equations describing polynomial, exponential, and logarithmic relationships."}, {"section_title": "Systems of equations and inequalities.", "text": "This domain focuses on interpreting and solving problems represented by systems of linear, quadratic, or a mixture of these equations and inequalities. Beginning with systems of linear equations, students develop both properties which guarantee solutions, number of solutions, or relationships (parallel and perpendicular). With this comes the construction, interpreting, and solving of 2 x 2 and 3 x 3 systems of equations. Students also analyze and explain the reasoning used to solve systems of linear equations in two variables. In a like manner, students construct systems of linear inequalities in two or three variables to represent a given context. Using methods of solving equations and systems of equations, students develop methods of representing and solving systems of inequalities and providing graphical interpretations of the resulting solutions. Sequences and recursive relationships. This domain focus on representing, analyzing, and solving problems which can be represented sequentially or recursively. Starting with growth patterns in linear and geometric patterns, students abstract and generalize rules for extending arithmetic and geometric sequences with given initial values and growth patterns. They also explore and solve problems dealing with the related series and sums of terms in them. Such patterns are then extended to more general recursive relationships and their use in modeling the long-term behavior of the situations they represent. Students develop and apply methods for linking the recursive and closed form representations for linear recursive relationships and use them to discuss long-term behavior based on initial values, rates of change, and intuitive concepts of the roles of convergence, divergence, and fixed points."}, {"section_title": "Algebraic Processes:", "text": "In a similar manner to the delineation of content growth, students are expected to acquire mathematical habits of mind or knowledge of algebraic processes. Four of these have been targeted for assessment as part of the HSLS:09 assessment. They are as follows. Demonstrating algebraic skills. This process domain refers to students' capabilities to display fluency in interpreting, manipulating, and making sense of symbolic expressions in a numerical or formal situation. This process category applies to situations from simple calculations to very complex procedures involving a variety of transformations of format and representation to produce desired results. The demonstrating of skills focuses on students' capabilities to perform manipulations correctly and with fluency based on definitions, rules, and properties of formal systems. It includes the interpretation of representations that students have studied as well as the recall and application of well-known formulas, definitions, and graphical representations to produce results. Using representations of algebraic ideas. This process domain refers to students' capabilities to interpret and translate among representations of numerical or algebraic concepts or relationships. They should be able to make, select, or modify representations to capture the essence of a situation. Such process related actions span the gamut from selecting and interpreting one standard or familiar representation to translating between or among a number of representations with possible modification or development of a simple representation to understanding and applying a non-standard representation that requires substantial decoding and interpreting. The use of representations at the high end of the spectrum can also involve comparing, contrasting, or evaluating the effectiveness of a representation. Performing algebraic reasoning. This process domain refers to students' reasoning and argumentation in algebraic settings. Particular focus is given to making inferences, checking a justification, or developing a justification. Stages of reasoning range from thinking about and interpreting inferences, separating steps in an argument into a sequence of discrete statements, and the application of direct reasoning to one aspect of an argument. At a higher level, the arguments become more extended with analyses now encompassing several variables and the following or creating of a multi-step argument based on different information sources. At the highest level, students are expected to evaluate, use, or create chains of reasoning to justify inferences, make generalizations, and combine multiple elements of information in a sustained and cohesive communication. Solving algebraic problems. This process domain refers to students' selecting or devising, as well as implementing, a mathematical strategy to solve problems arising from the task or context. To assess the extent to which this identity formation process shapes later educational and occupational decisions, we used a set of new items developed in part by Marie Claire-Shanahan at the University of Alberta.   98.

How many times has [9th grader] changed schools since he/she first entered school? Do not count changes that occurred as a result of promotion to the next grade or level (for example, a move from an elementary school to from a middle school or from a middle school to a high school in the same district). Please enter zero if your 9th grader has not changed schools except for promotion.                 o None of the above 20.
