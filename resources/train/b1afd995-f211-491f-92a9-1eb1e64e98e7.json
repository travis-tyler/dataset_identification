[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Mean sea level rise (MSLR) scenarios are helpful to quantify and envision what levels of inundation and flooding may occur in the future and what the consequences may be. As the public, policy makers, and coastal infrastructure managers are coming to better appreciate the range and magnitude of possible future risks associated with MSLR, engineers are being tasked to assess the threat to the coastal infrastructure. Therefore, they need to know how to usefully apply either regional or global MSLR projections at any specific location. Dozens of possible future MSLR scenarios have been published. Their number will grow as global projections are refined and revised based on better understanding of the processes, especially the role and capacity of the ice caps in causing rapid MSLR (Vermeer and Rahmstorf 2009;Nichols et al. 2011), and as regional processes are included to assess risks associated with future extreme sea levels (Cayan et al. 2008). Current MSLR projections are all concave upward-that is, with some initial rate of rise and acceleration as time goes on-and are varyingly quoted as for the next 100 years or for this century with total mean sea level (MSL) increases ranging from about 0.2 to 2.0 m with a central range of 0.5-1.5 m by 2100 (Rahmstorf 2010;Pfeffer et al. 2008). Extreme projections up to 5.0 m predicated on rapid ice sheet collapse have been proposed by Hansen and Sato (2012) based on paleoclimate considerations. A factor that confuses the practical application of MSLR projections is their varying starting years. The National Research Council (NRC 1987) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE 2009) use 1986, but USACE (2011) uses 1992. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2008) and Rahmstorf (2007) projections start in 1990, whereas Cayan et al. (2008) and Chadwick et al. (2011Chadwick et al. ( ) use 2000 For MSLR considerations in the abstract, it is sufficient to specify a start year and some rise trajectory with an end point value (say, 1.0 m by 2100). However, if specific geodetically referenced future MSLR scenario values are needed to quantify actual future sea level relative to the ground, these general specifications are inadequate. Two problems arise: (1) accounting for the interannual variability of sea level at a particular location and (2) obtaining the correct relationship between local MSL and a geodetic datum or other tidal datums. These two issues are closely related. Local or regional MSL in any given year may be substantially higher or lower than the average value around that start year. Therefore, starting a future MSLR trajectory at a given single year could significantly bias the projections as high or low. For example, at La Jolla, California, and Sewells Point, Virginia, interannual variations range up to about 0.10 m. To solve the first problem, a suitable average of annual MSL values needs to be calculated from which to start the future MSLR trajectory. To deal with the second issue, the local datum relationships must be determined and applied. The clearest engineering guidance to accomplish this is USACE (2009) and its update USACE (2011), which give a detailed recipe for calculating the MSLR between any given past or future year using some simple assumptions. The method is based on NRC (1987), which introduced three global scenarios (0.5-, 1.0-, and 1.5-m rise by 2100) spanning low, medium, and high rates of possible future MSLRs using quadratic forms with start-year 1986. (Quadratic MSLR projection curves require specification of a starting year and two constants that are equivalent to an initial rate of rise at the start year and an acceleration term.) Revision of expiring USACE (2009) to produce USACE (2011) was partly prompted by conversations among the authors to address these problems. The USACE (2011) solution was to set the start year for future MSLR scenarios at 1992; the middle of the current National Tidal Datum Epoch (NTDE) (1983)(1984)(1985)(1986)(1987)(1988)(1989)(1990)(1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001). This way, the tidal and geodetic datum relationships already published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for the NTDE can be used directly (http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/station_ retrieve.shtml?type=Datums). The USACE (2011) guidance shows how to adjust the NRC (1987) scenarios of MSLR at any future time relative to any other time after 1992. The technique also includes steps to account for differences in local MSLR rates, for example, as a result of subsidence. Therefore, USACE (2011) provides a method to reference the NRC (1987) projected future MSLR scenarios to the usual local tidal datums, and NAVD88 or any other local geodetic reference, such as the San Francisco Vertical Elevation Datum. This paper extends and generalizes the USACE (2009, 2011) guidance by offering a method that consistently ties future proposed MSLR trajectory values relative to any start year to local tidal or geodetic datums. This method accounts for both local annual sea level variability and alternative scenario starting years by calculating averages over the appropriate 19-year interval centered on the scenario start year. This also represents a generalization of the NOAA and National Ocean Service (NOAA/NOS) NTDE methodology that preserves the all-important 19-year averaging process, which removes the interannual fluctuations. Calculations using actual sea level data from La Jolla and Sewells Point (Hampton Roads) are used to demonstrate the method (see Fig. 1)."}, {"section_title": "Tidal Datum Epochs", "text": "On the U.S. ocean coasts, floating tidal datums and fixed land-based local geodetic reference elevations are traditionally related by using various water level averages calculated over a specific 19-year interval (the NTDE) currently set at 1983-2001 and are subject to periodic review and revision. This length is the closest integral number of years that accommodates the 18.61-year lunar node tidal cycle (Cartwright and Tayler 1971); the longest of practical significance. It also averages over both the interannual climate variability and the 8.85-year lunar perigee cycle, which contributes important fluctuations in the range of tides at a period of approximately 4.4 years (Cartwright 1974;Zetler and Flick 1985;Flick et al. 2003;Haigh et al. 2011). NOAA's NOS calculates and publishes the NTDE tidal datum averages, including the mean lower low water, mean high water, and MSL, among others. NOS, along with the National Geodetic Survey (NGS), determine and publish the relationships between these floating sea level datums and the land-based geodetic reference, NAVD88. Local datums can, in turn, be referenced by their relationships to NAVD88. The 19-year averaging used in the specific-interval NTDE solves the problem of accounting for interannual variation in MSLs. However, to accommodate scenarios with differing start years, the NTDE 19-year epoch can simply be generalized by using a 19-year interval with the proposed MSLR scenario start year at its center. For example, if a MSLR scenario has 1990 as the start year the appropriate 19-year averaging interval would span 1981-1999, where 1990 is the center year. For a start year of 2000 the epoch would be 1991-2009, in which 2000 is central. The only drawback to this approach, or any other using 19year averages, is that the MSLR scenario start years must be at least nine years in the past in order for sufficient subsequent data to be available for the averaging. Both global and regionally tuned MSLR scenarios can be equally well accommodated using this procedure. The process to accomplish the MSLR scenario adjustments is detailed in the subsequent section using the two examples from La Jolla and Sewells Point."}, {"section_title": "Scenario Adjustment Procedure", "text": "The following paragraphs present the step-by-step recipe for calculating future MSL values from any given projected MSLR scenario Fig. 1. Annual MSL at La Jolla, California (1927-2011; triangles), and Sewells Point (Hampton Roads), Virginia (1928-2011; squares), both adjusted to zero at 1928: straight solid lines indicate respective linear trends (4.5 mm/year at Sewells Point and 2.0 mm/year at La Jolla); broken line is the Church and White (2006) global MSLR reconstruction (1928 also set to zero), which closely coincides with the overall La Jolla trend relative to an arbitrary start year. The first six steps involve determining the proper start-year epoch MSL elevation relative to the desired datum. In these steps, reference is made to Table 1, which contains the numeric values used in the examples. 1. Determine the start year of the scenario(s) being considered. In the subsequent examples, the start year is 2000. 2. Determine the 19-year epoch that has the start year as its midpoint. The first year of the epoch is simply the start year minus 9, and the last year is the start year plus 9. Thus, in the examples, the epoch years are 1991 (2000 2 9) to 2009 (2000 1 9). As this step implies, the procedure only works for start years at least nine-years old; otherwise, the needed annual MSL values will not be available for one or more of the later years of the 19-year epoch. 3. Obtain or calculate the 19-year average sea level for the desired (1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009) epoch from an applicable water level (tide gauge) station relative to its station datum. This may be accomplished by downloading monthly MSL data from NOS (http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/) and calculating the average, or by consulting NOS or other experts. The averages calculated in this way for La Jolla (NOAA Tide Gauge Station 941-0230) and Sewells Point (NOAA Tide Gauge Station 863-8610) are 2.167 and 1.791 m, respectively, as given in Table 1. 4. Obtain the datum relationships for the station from NOS or the NGS (http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/). In the examples, the elevations of NAVD88 are 1.389 and 1.837 m relative to the respective station datums (Table 1). These values do not change over time, at least for oceanographic reasons, because the station datum is fixed relative to the local geodetic reference elevations, unlike in the floating tidal datums, such as the MSL. 5. Adjust the start-year centered 19-year epoch MSL value to the appropriate datum by subtracting the datum elevation. In the examples for La Jolla and Sewells Point, the results are 0.778 and 20.046 m relative to local NAVD88, respectively (Table 1). The remaining step involves calculating any desired future-year MSL elevations relative to the geodetic datum, where reference is made to Table 2. 6. Add the future MSLR value relative to the given start year to the adjusted start-year elevation. In the examples illustrated, the MSL elevations relative to NAVD88 resulting from a MSLR of 0.432 m by 2050 and 1.500 m by 2100 relative to 2000 are desired ( Table 2). The results of adding these relative MSLR values to the respective start-year elevations are also given in Table 2, and these are the desired values. Any other future projected MSL values relative to NAVD88 can be computed using this recipe. The results of the aforementioned procedure for the examples of La Jolla and Sewells Point are illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. Fig. 2 shows the annual MSL data from La Jolla (connected triangles) and the global MSL reconstruction (broken line, left) developed by Church and White (2006), as well as four future MSLR scenarios (four broken lines emanating at the right) with respective rise end points of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 m by 2100 relative to start-year 2000. The 19-year (1991-2009) average MSL is shown as a horizontal line (at 0.778 m, NAVD88) (Table 1) with disks at each end (1991 and 2009) and in the middle (2000; arrow). All elevations are adjusted to the local NAVD88 geodetic datum using the steps set forth; note the 6 0.05-m annual MSL fluctuations are especially apparent during the El Ni\u00f1o MSL enhancement in 1997. Fig. 3 shows the same information as Fig. 2 but with the MSL data (connected squares) from Sewells Point (Hampton Roads) adjusted to local NAVD88; similar 60.05-m annual MSL fluctuations also exist. Trends in local MSL are an added complication. However, the method herein proposed to adjust future MSLR projections to the local tidal or geodetic datum elevations does not depend on the trends in either the regional sea level or the projections. Selecting the proper trends to produce reasonable regional projections is important and is considered in the USACE (2009, 2011) methodology. However, the adjustment procedure to tie these projections to local elevation datums is the same regardless of any trends. The importance of accounting for regional or local trends is coincidentally well illustrated in the examples from La Jolla and Sewells Point. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the Church and White (2006) pre-2000 global MSLR trend coincides closely with the MSL data at La Jolla but not at Hampton Roads. This is consistent with the notion that the ground elevation at La Jolla is relatively stable and that Sewells Point is subsiding. Regardless of the cause(s), the overall MSLR rate since the records began was about 2.0 mm/year at La Jolla but 4.5 mm/year at Sewells Point. The same considerations would apply to locations where the relative MSL is falling. For example, the MSL at Juneau, Alaska, has dropped steadily at a rate of 213 mm/year from 1936 to 2011 because crustal isostatic rebound from glacial unweighting is causing the land to rise much faster than the sea level (Peltier and Andrews 1976). Obviously, these various background rates of MSLR should be taken into account when considering future MSLR projections, assuming that the local underlying processes causing the differences between local and global MSLR rates will stay the same. Additional complexities arise when the rate of the MSLR varies over decadal periods, which is well illustrated at La Jolla. The MSLR rate at La Jolla from 1980 to 2011 was only about 0.5 mm/year, a factor of 4 smaller than the overall rate, as a result of the dynamical suppression caused by large-scale wind patterns over the Pacific Ocean (Bromirski et al. 2011). Meanwhile, at Sewells Point the MSLR rate over the same period was an order of magnitude higher at about 6 mm/year. Figs. 2 and 3 (the curves emanating at the right) each show a set of four future scenarios with respective MSLR end point values of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 m by 2100 relative to start-year 2000. The four curves at La Jolla (Fig. 2) are based on an initial rise rate of about 3 mm/year, corresponding to the current global rate (AVISO, http:// www.aviso.oceanobs.com/duacs/), with acceleration terms calculated such that each curve reaches its desired end point by 2100. The four curves at Sewells Point (Fig. 3) used start rates of 6 mm/ year corresponding to the rate of rise observed there over the past 30 years merely for the purpose of illustrating the method; the 0.5 m by 2100 scenario actually requires a slight deceleration from this recent initial MSLR rate. This shows that if the rates over the  immediate past merely continue, the MSLR at Sewells Point will exceed 0.5 m by 2100 relative to 2000. While not affecting the procedure proposed herein, these scenario curves are nevertheless illustrative of the range of MSLRs that may occur. They are instructive and useful for assessing potential damages assuming that future MSLR follows the assumed scenarios (Chadwick et al. 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "A step-by-step method is presented to consistently calculate future MSL scenario elevations relative to a local geodetic datum, given a start year at least 9 years in the past, and the appropriate projected MSLR values relative to that start year. It is important to use the 19year epoch average MSL with the start year at the center as the beginning of the projections owing to the variability of annual MSL values from year to year and to properly account for various start years. The proposed methodology extends and generalizes the guidance provided by USACE (2009USACE ( , 2011 while preserving and also generalizing the 19-year averaging method long used by NOAA (2001) for NTDE calculations.
