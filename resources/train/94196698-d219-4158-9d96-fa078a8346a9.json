A common perception about immigrant assimilation is that association with natives necessarily speeds the process by which immigrants become indistinguishable from natives. Using 2000 Census data, this paper casts doubt on this presumption by examining the effect of an immigrant's marriage to a native, a measure of social integration, on dropout rates of children from these marriages. Although second-generation immigrants with one native parent generally have lower dropout rates than those with two foreign-born parents, the relationship reverses when steps are taken to control for observable and unobservable background characteristics. That is, immigrants that marry natives have children that are more likely to dropout of high school than immigrants that marry other immigrants. Moreover, gender differences in the effect of marriage to a native disappear in specifications which control for the endogeneity of the marriage decision.\nJEL Classification: J12, J61, Z13"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Immigration policy has sparked many heated debates in the US, and the question of how fast today's immigrants are assimilating lies at the forefront of this debate. A possible explanation for the lack of consensus is that assimilation, the process by which immigrants and their descendents become indistinguishable from natives, occurs through many di\u00a4erent dimensions. Rapid convergence to certain native trends may in fact impede the speed at which immigrants become similar to natives in other aspects. In this paper, I examine the relationship between two di\u00a4erent types of assimilation: marital assimilation, or marriage of an immigrant to a native, 1 and human capital accumulation of children as measured by high school dropout rates.\nAs discussed in Bean and Stevens (2003) , immigration policy has important e\u00a4ects on the marital decisions of immigrants. The 1965 Immigration Reform Act relaxed the quota system in the US, replacing it with a system favoring family reuni\u2026cation. Because spouses are considered immediate family members, marriage to a citizen may have become a particularly attractive method for attaining legal immigrant status. In fact, about 25 percent of immigrants entering the US each year are admitted as spouses of citizens (Bean and Stevens 2003) .\nAside from any direct e\u00a4ects on marriage patterns, the law changed the ethnic composition of immigrants making it relatively more di\u00a2 cult for them to \u2026nd native born spouses of the same race. In contrast to the historically white foreign born population, according to the 2003 Current Population Survey, a little over half of the foreign born today are Latin American and a quarter are Asian (Larsen 2004) . Meanwhile, only about 13 percent of the US population is Hispanic and four percent Asian, according to the 2000 Census (Grieco and Cassidy 2001) . Qian and Lichter (2001) argue that this change in the racial composition of immigrants decreased the percentage of immigrants married to the native born.\nThe law change is also believed to be responsible for the decline in the relative education levels of immigrants. Although they are just as likely to have a bachelors degree or above, immigrants are much less likely to have a high school diploma and are signi\u2026cantly less likely to have graduated the 9th grade (Larsen 2004) . Given the importance of assortative matching on education in the marriage market (see, for example, Furtado 2006) , di\u00a4erences in education may also lead to fewer marriages between the foreign born and the native born.\nAn important question then is whether an immigrant's marriage to another immigrant slows assimilation. Concerned about this very issue, the country of Denmark recently passed legislation which limits the ability of immigrants to import their spouses from their countries of birth. Using this policy change to instrument for immigrants' marriages to other immigrants, Nielson et al. (2007) \u2026nd that marriage to a native increases the probability that the immigrant is enrolled in school. Employing a di\u00a4erent identi\u2026cation strategy, I examine the e\u00a4ect of immigrant-native marriages on high school dropout rates of children from these marriages.\nIt is particularly important to study outcomes of the second-generation because the native born children of immigrants spend their entire lives in the country. Since they acquire schooling, work, pay taxes, and participate in welfare programs all in the US, their success needs to be carefully considered when calculating the long run costs and bene\u2026ts of immigration (Card 2005) . In this paper, the academic achievement of second-generation immigrants is measured by whether the [16] [17] year old children of immigrants have dropped out of school. Although chosen mainly for practical purposes, this is a critical measure of academic success given its impact on later labor market outcomes. High school dropouts, even those who hold a General Educational Development (GED) certi\u2026cate, have substantially lower earnings than high school graduates (Murnane, Willett, and Tyler 2000) . They are also signi\u2026cantly more likely to be unemployed: In 2006, the unemployment 3 rate for the general population was 3.6 percent while it was 6.8 percent for high school dropouts (National Center for Educational Statistics 2007).\nStudies have shown that the native born, grown children of cross-nativity marriages have better educational outcomes than children of two foreign born parents. After controlling for age, sex, and race, Ramakrishnan (2004) \u2026nds that compared to having two foreign born parents, having a native born parent and a foreign born parent decreases the probability of dropping out of high school and increases educational attainment. Similarly, Chiswick and DebBurman (2003) \u2026nd that children of cross-nativity parents have more years of schooling than children with two foreign born parents.\nIt is di\u00a2 cult to interpret these \u2026ndings because it is unclear whether the positive e\u00a4ects of having a native born parent are coming from individual characteristics of the immigrant parent that chooses to marry a native, characteristics of the native born parent that chooses to marry an immigrant, or attributes of the marriages themselves including the communities surrounding these marriages. Using 2000 Census data, this paper presents preliminary evidence consistent with the \u2026ndings of Ramakrishnan (2004) and Chiswick and DebBurman (2003) that second-generation immigrants with a native born parent perform better than those with two foreign born parents.\nHowever, after controlling for even the most basic parental background variables such as education and income, the relationship reverses. In order to control for the endogeneity of the marriage decision, this paper takes the approach common in the intermarriage literature which is to exploit information on the availability of foreign born potential spouses in one's marriage market. Ordinary least squares estimates with a full set of controls and instrumental variable estimates both suggest that an immigrant's marriage to a native as opposed to another immigrant results in higher dropout rates for children from these marriages.\nThis study also investigates whether the e\u00a4ects of an immigrant's marriage to a native di\u00a4ers by gender. Least squares regressions which control for a variety of family characteristics suggest that a foreign born female's marriage to a native has no signi\u2026cant impact on her child's probability of dropping out while a foreign born male's marriage to a native increases the probability that his child drops out. However, in IV speci\u2026cations, there are no signi\u2026cant di\u00a4erences in the e\u00a4ects of marriage to a native by gender: For both immigrant males and females, marriage to a native increases the probability that a child drops out of high school by about 10 percentage points. 2 The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, I discuss the theoretical underpinnings of the analysis. Section 3 describes the data and presents preliminary descriptive analyses. Section 4 provides an empirical strategy for identifying the causal impact of intermarriage on children's dropout rates and discusses results. Gender di\u00a4erences in the e\u00a4ects of marriage to a native are also explored in this section. Section 5 concludes with a discussion of the signi\u2026cance of the \u2026ndings."}, {"section_title": "Theoretical Background and Empirical Approach", "text": "There are two main types of causal mechanisms through which an immigrant's marriage to another immigrant could a\u00a4ect child outcomes. First, even if marriage partners are randomly assigned, parents born in the same country may have a di\u00a4erent technology for producing child human capital and this could lead to either positive or negative outcomes for their children. For example, the second-generation immigrants with a native born parent are more likely to have English as a \u2026rst language and even only language (Stevens and Swicegood 1985) when compared to children with two foreign born parents. Since English pro\u2026ciency is positively correlated with academic outcomes even after controlling for a number of household characteristics (Glick and White 2003, 2 In a study exploiting the plausibly random allocation of Moluccan immigrants across the Netherlands, van Ours and Veenman (2008) \u2026nd that children from marriages with a Moluccan father and a native mother have a higher educational attainment than children from ethnic homogeneous Moluccan couples and children from a Moluccan mother and a native father. Our results suggest that immigrants in the US do not seem to assimilate via the same processes as Moluccans in the Netherlands. used to \u2026nance better schools, tutoring services, and other educational resources, then this could explain why children with two foreign born parents have worse educational outcomes than children with one native born parent. Also, the classic quantity/quality trade-o\u00a4 in children suggests that families with more children cannot a\u00a4ord to invest as much in their human capital. If immigrants that choose to marry other immigrants have a higher relative preference for quantity of children as opposed to quality or alternatively, face a higher relative price for quality of children, they will choose to have more children but invest less in their human capital (see Chiswick 1988) . There is also evidence that the labor supply of female immigrants di\u00a4ers depending on whether they are married to immigrants or natives (Baker and Benjamin 1997) . 4 Although the literature has not produced a conclusive answer as to how mother's labor supply a\u00a4ects child outcomes, it is important to take it into account. The present study controls for all of these avenues which could be generating a spurious correlation between intermarriage and child outcomes.\nIt is also necessary to consider the locations where the immigrants that are most likely to marry other immigrants live. The foreign born that reside within close geographic proximity to other immigrants are less likely to marry natives, but are more likely to bene\u2026t from ethnic networks.\nThere is a large literature on the bene\u2026ts of ethnic networks for \u2026nding jobs (Edin et al. 2003 , Munshi 2003 , and these same networks could bene\u2026t children's educational attainment. Moreover, studies have shown that attachment to an ethnic network is more useful when the network is larger (Gang and Zimmerman 2000) . To account for these issues, the empirical analysis in this paper controls for both the size of the immigrant population in the immigrant's state as well as whether or not the immigrant lives in a metropolitan area. Also, because there is substantial regional variation on immigrant's earnings in Australia and France respectively, Kantarevic (2004) fails to \u2026nd a causal e\u00a4ect for immigrants in the US. 4 Baker and Benjamin (1997) conclude that family composition is an important correlate of assimilation for immigrants in Canada. They present evidence consistent with the family investment model, which predicts that foreign born women accept dead-end jobs in order to provide liquidity for their immigrant husbands' investment in human capital. Blau et al. (2003) \u2026nd no such evidence for the US.\nin both educational outcomes and the size of the immigrant population, region of residence is also controlled for in the empirical analysis.\nThere is tremendous variation in average educational attainment by ethnic group. In fact, 30 percent of the variation in the education of immigrants can be explained simply with country of origin dummy variables (Card 2005) . Certain ethnic groups, for many reasons, may invest less in their children's education and have low intermarriage rates. For example, foreign born males in ethnic groups with strict gender roles may \u2026nd it more di\u00a2 cult to \u2026nd native women accepting of traditional gender roles and may also place less value on children's education. As another example, immigrants in groups with a long history of migration to the US may \u2026nd it easier to \u2026nd natives with similar values. If these groups have unusually high or low levels of education, then the estimate of the e\u00a4ect of marriage to a native will be signi\u2026cantly biased. To deal with these concerns, country of birth \u2026xed e\u00a4ects are accounted for in the analysis.\nBecause even within ethnic groups and controlling for a relatively extensive list of observable characteristics, immigrants that choose to marry other immigrants may be di\u00a4erent from immigrants that choose to marry natives, endogeneity bias remains a concern. To address endogeneity issues, an instrumental variables approach is taken in this paper. Since one's spouse choice and decisions regarding child raising are very much intertwined, it is di\u00a2 cult to \u2026nd a variable correlated with whether or not one's spouse is foreign born but excluded from a child outcome equation. Meng and Gregory (2005) deal with this problem by instrumenting for the intermarriage decision using ethnic group size and sex-ratios within ethnicity-age-religion cells. Building on this technique, I instrument for marriage decisions of foreign born males (females) using the size of the foreign born never-married female (male) population of a similar age when and where immigrants were most likely searching for spouses. 8 "}, {"section_title": "Data Description", "text": "The main analysis in this paper utilizes data from the 5% Public Use Samples of the 2000 US Census on families with at least one foreign born parent, while the excluded instrumental variable is constructed using the 5% sample of the 1980 US Census. Both sets of data were obtained from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) (Ruggles 2003) . These samples contain detailed information on household and person level characteristics yet are large enough to construct accurate measures of the size of foreign born population in relatively narrow gender-age-state cells. A major disadvantage of these data is that parental information on issues such as country of birth and years of schooling, is only available for children residing with both parents. 5 For this reason, only the outcomes of native born children who are between the ages of 16 and 17 and residing with both biological parents are considered in the analysis. In families with more than one child in this age range, only the eldest is used. Because it is important to control for earnings when examining the e\u00a4ect of marital decisions on child outcomes, families in which both mothers and fathers have zero earnings are dropped from the sample. Lastly, we consider only the e\u00a4ects of marital decisions of immigrants between the ages of 35 and 64 that are either household heads or their spouses.\nBecause adult children living with both parents may be a very selected sample, the outcome of interest used in the analysis is whether a child, aged 16 or 17, is still enrolled in school. Since the structure of the US economy has shifted towards skill-intensive jobs, high school dropouts face particularly strong barriers to economic progress. Thus, even if immigrant intermarriage decisions have only a small e\u00a4ect on high school dropout rates of their children, this can imply substantial di\u00a4erences in intergenerational assimilation patterns.\nThe independent variable of interest is whether an immigrant is married to a native, or from a di\u00a4erent perspective, whether the 16-17 year old child has one as opposed to two foreign born parents. It is important to keep in mind that when two immigrants marry each other, they need not have the same country of birth. For example, a Mexican-born immigrant married to a German immigrant is classi\u2026ed as belonging to an immigrant-immigrant marriage in this study.\nMeanwhile, a Mexican immigrant marrying a second-generation Mexican immigrant is classi\u2026ed as marrying a native. The \u2026rst issue proves not to be much of a concern, since 92 percent of all of the marriages between two immigrants in the sample involve immigrants with the same country of birth. Moreover, most of the eight percent from di\u00a4erent countries are from countries with the same cultural background, such as a Mexican marrying someone from Central America (Author's own calculations).\nBecause parents'countries of birth was not asked in the 2000 Census, it is di\u00a2 cult to measure the extent to which immigrants marrying natives are marrying the native born children of immigrants from the same country of birth. The Census does contain information on ancestry, but responses to the ancestry question have been found to be inconsistent (Farley 1991) . 6 According to the 1970 Census, the last Census to ask for parents'countries of birth, of the immigrants that marry natives, only about ten percent marry children of immigrants from their country of birth (Furtado 2006 US born mother and foreign born father have the highest dropout rates (2.4 percent) and children with a US born father and a foreign born mother have the lowest dropout rates (1.7 percent).\nAs discussed in the previous section, there are many parental characteristics which may a\u00a4ect both intermarriage rates and dropout rates of children. The foreign born have fewer years of schooling than the native born. 9 Consistent with the literature on assortative mating on education, immigrants that marry other immigrants have fewer years of schooling than those that marry and Bleakley and Chin (2008) \u2026nd similar dropout rates using a similar sample. Also, The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) has data on whether parents are native or foreign born regardless of coresidence. Based on the author's calculations, the relationships between 8th grade grades and family type using NELS:88 data closely mirror the relationships for dropout rates by family type using Census data. 9 The 2000 Census contains information on educational attainment. To construct a continuous years of schooling variable from last grade completed and degree achieved, I used the mapping in Kalmijn (1996) . natives. The native born males married to foreign born females have the highest levels of education.\nIncome patterns mirror education patterns, with households composed of two immigrant parents having signi\u2026cantly less income than any of the other categories. Families with two foreign born parents have more children than families with a native parent. Similarly, mothers are more likely be in the labor force if they are married to a native. Not surprisingly, the foreign born married to the foreign born have lived in the US for fewer years and are less likely to speak English than those married to natives. They are also more likely to live in metropolitan areas and in states with large immigrant populations."}, {"section_title": "Analytical Strategy and Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Least Squares Speci\u2026cation", "text": "The purpose of this study is to disentangle the e\u00a4ects of marriage to a native on children's academic outcomes from the characteristics of the immigrants and the natives that choose to intermarry.\nConsider the following equation for estimating the probability that an immigrant's teenager is a high school dropout, where i denotes the immigrant and j the country of birth:\nD is a dichotomous variable taking the value of one if the immigrant's teenager is not enrolled in school and does not have a high school degree and zero otherwise, N B S is a dichotomous variable equal to one if the immigrant's spouse is native born and zero if he/she is foreign born, X is a vector of the immigrant's characteristics such as education, language ability, and years in the US, X S is a vector of the spouse's characteristics, and X C is a vector of child or neighborhood characteristics such as child age and whether the family lives in a metropolitan area.

In column 2, controls for own and spouse years of schooling as well as income, whether the mother works outside of the home, and number of children in the household are added.\n1 0 To check robustness, I ran speci\u2026cations which classi\u2026ed the person of interest as the immigrant that has been in the US longer. I also conducted the analysis only on foreign born household heads, de\u2026ning the spouse to be the spouse of the head. Lastly, I randomly assigned the husband to be the person of interest and the wife to be the spouse for half of the couples. For the other half, I assign the wife to be the person of interest and the husband to be the spouse. For all methods of identifying the person of interest, the main results were robust."}, {"section_title": "13", "text": "The coe\u00a2 cient on marriage to a native reverses in sign and remains statistically signi\u2026cant suggesting that the lower dropout rates of children with a native born parent can be entirely explained by characteristics of parents that choose to intermarry. In fact, controlling for the education variables alone is su\u00a2 cient to generate a positive relationship between marriage to a native and children's probability of dropping out of high school.\nColumn 3 adds to the model measures of immigrant assimilation, speci\u2026cally whether both spouses speak English, size of the immigrant population in the immigrant's state of residence, and maximum years since migration. Years since migration is set to zero for natives. When both spouses are foreign born, the variable takes the value of the spouse that has been in the U.S. for the most time. The coe\u00a2 cient on native born parent increases further when these variables are added to the model. Lastly, column 4 incorporates country of birth \u2026xed e\u00a4ects. Although the coe\u00a2 cient on marriage to a native is no longer signi\u2026cant at the 10 percent value (p-value of .11), the magnitude of the coe\u00a2 cient remains similar to the other speci\u2026cations. In speci\u2026cations which control for parental characteristics, the least squares estimates suggest that an immigrant's marriage to a native increases his or her child's probability of dropping out by half or a little less than a half a percentage point."}, {"section_title": "An Instrumental Variables Approach", "text": "Further di\u00a2 culty in this type of analysis arises from the unobserved characteristics of the immigrants that choose to marry natives and the natives that choose to marry immigrants. In equation 1, the unobserved characteristics in \" could potentially be correlated with N B and thus lead to biased estimates of 1 : From a theoretical perspective, the bias cannot be signed. On the one hand, higher ability immigrants may be both more likely to marry natives and have higher ability children, regardless of whom they marry. This would lead to a negative bias on 1 , meaning least squares estimates would suggest that native born parents decrease dropout rates of children more than they actually do. On the other hand, if immigrants prefer to marry natives, for example because natives can give them citizenship status, then at equilibrium, the unobserved characteristics of the natives that immigrants marry be worse than the unobserved characteristics of the immigrants that immigrants marry. 11 Moreover, if immigrants that choose to marry other immigrants are more optimistic about their children's success, then children with two immigrant parents may have higher academic aspirations than children with only one immigrant parent. This would also lead to a positive bias on 1 : That is, least squares estimates would imply that native born parents increase dropout rates more than they actually do:\nTo deal with these issues, an IV approach is taken. The excluded instrument used is the percent foreign born of the never married population of the opposite sex within the immigrant's desired age group in the state in which he or she was most probably searching for a spouse. Age groups are established using \u2026ve year intervals and males are assumed to search for females two years younger than them. 12 Also, when the state of current residence is di\u00a4erent from the state of birth of the immigrant's teenager, immigrants are assumed to have been searching for a spouse in the state of birth of the child. Theory suggests that the larger the share of foreign born potential spouses, the less likely it is that an immigrant marries a native even just by random matching. 13 1 1 This is a special case of Merton's exchange hypothesis (1941). Celikaksoy et al. (2006) \u2026nd that Pakistani marriage migrants to Denmark have higher education levels than the Danes that marry Pakistani immigrants. This suggests that Pakistani marriage migrants are willing to pay a premium in order to live in Denmark. However, Turkish marriage migrants have lower education levels than the Danes that marry Turks suggesting that Turkish immigrants are willing to pay a premium for the \"unspoiled traditional norms\" possessed by potential spouses in their home countries. Column 2 of table 3 presents second stage results from the instrumented regressions. Compared to the least squares estimates, the coe\u00a2 cient on native born spouse increases in magnitude suggesting that it is the foreign born that are mostly likely to have dropout children that marry immigrants. After correcting for this selection, it is even more bene\u2026cial for children's educational outcomes for immigrants to marry other immigrants. 14 Part of the identi\u2026cation arises from cross-state variation in the size of the foreign born population. There could, however, be other factors correlated with the size of the foreign born population which vary by state. For example, perhaps immigrants tend to live in states with better education policies. For this reason, average years of schooling, computed using all adults aged 25 and above, by state is included in the empirical speci\u2026cation shown in column 3. The coe\u00a2 cient on native born spouse is not a\u00a4ected suggesting that state di\u00a4erences in education are not driving the results. 1 4 Because IV strategies only recover local average treatment e\u00a4ects (LATE), it is important to consider which immigrants would be most a\u00a4ected by the instrument. One can imagine that if marriage decisions were at least partly determined by random matching (see Furtado 2006 for a simple model of interethnic marriage incorporating random matching), the marriage decisions of all foreign born males are a\u00a4ected by an increase in the percentage of foreign born potential spouses. However, certain immigrants should be more sensitive to the availability of foreign born spouses than others. For example, some immigrants will marry immigrants, perhaps by importing a spouse, regardless of how di\u00a2 cult it is to \u2026nd an immigrant spouse. This could be due to language barriers or their \"unattractiveness\" to natives. These immigrants would not be a\u00a4ected by the IV and so the results in this paper do not apply to this group. This table reports first and second stage regression coefficients. The sample consists of intact married couples involving at least one foreign-born parent with a biological, native-born 16 or 17 year old child residing in the household. The sum of husband and wife's wages is greater is posiitve for all families. Immigrants and their spouses are between the ages of 35 and 64. The excluded instrument is the percent foreign of the opposite sex in the immigrant's age group in the state in which he or she was most likely searching for a spouse. Standard errors adjusted for state-age group clustering are reported in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.10. immigrants that arrived before the age 18. In the sample of couples arriving in di\u00a4erent years, the coe\u00a2 cient on marriage to a native remains at around 0.12. However, the coe\u00a2 cient on marriage to a native is smaller and less precisely estimated using the sample of immigrants arriving as children. This is presumably due to a signi\u2026cantly smaller sample size coupled with the possibility that the children of young arrivers are slightly less sensitive to marriage decisions of their parents. In all speci\u2026cations and samples, immigrants married to natives have children who are more likely to be high school dropouts.\nAs another robustness check not shown in the table, I conducted the analysis only on immigrants from English-speaking countries. 15 Because immigrants from English-speaking countries share many cultural attributes with Americans and do not face language barriers, we can learn whether it is being a migrant that a\u00a4ects child outcomes or it is something related to language and the places from which immigrants migrate. The coe\u00a2 cients of interest were all insigni\u2026cant when the sample was restricted to immigrants from English-speaking countries suggesting that the "}, {"section_title": "Gender E\u00a4ects of Intermarriage", "text": "Another interesting question is whether the e\u00a4ect of marriage to a native di\u00a4ers by gender of the immigrant. Ramakrishnan (2004) \u2026nds that conditional on race and age, second-generation immigrants with a native born father have lower dropout rates than those with native born mothers. Similarly, although it is unlikely that the di\u00a4erence is statistically signi\u2026cant, Chiswick and DebBurman (2003) \u2026nd that children with a native father and foreign born mother have slightly higher levels of educational attainment than children with a foreign born father and native mother.\nNeither of these studies control for education of parents. However, there is evidence that the relationship between education and marriage to a US citizen di\u00a4ers by gender: Among married couples formed by a US citizen sponsoring an immigrant spouse, US citizen husbands and their wives have substantially more schooling than citizen wives and their husbands (Jasso and Rosenzweig 1990, Jasso et al. 2000) . This section of the paper explores whether the e\u00a4ect of marriage to a native di\u00a4ers by gender of the foreign born parent when steps are taken to control for both observable and unobservable characteristics of immigrants and their spouses. Table 4 presents regression results from speci\u2026cations which allow for gender di\u00a4erences in the e\u00a4ects of marriage to a native. Just like in the previous sets of regressions, the immigrant residing in the US for the least amount of time is considered the person of interest in immigrant-immigrant couples, but results were robust to the di\u00a4erent classi\u2026cation schemes discussed in footnote 10. The \u2026rst column shows regression results from a very basic least squares speci\u2026cation which includes an interaction between marriage to a native and being a foreign born male. The estimates suggest that while a foreign born female's marriage to a native decreases her child's probability of dropping out by almost one percentage point, a foreign born male's decision to marry a native has no e\u00a4ect on the probability that his child drops out of high school. This di\u00a4erence between males and females is statistically signi\u2026cant at the ten percent level. However, given the evidence provided by Jasso and Rosenzweig (1990) and Jasso et al. (2000) discussed above, one may suspect that the reason it is bene\u2026cial for immigrant females to marry natives is simply that these couples have more years of schooling on average.\nTo examine this issue, a richer set of controls is added to the model. The estimates in column 2 of Table 4 imply that a foreign born female's marriage to a native has no signi\u2026cant impact on her child's dropout probability, but a foreign born male's marriage to a native increases his child's dropout probability. Results from an F test of the sum of the coe\u00a2 cients on marriage to a native and its interaction with being male suggests that the e\u00a4ect of marriage to a native for a foreign born male is statistically signi\u2026cant at the \u2026ve percent level.\nThere are many potential explanations for the seemingly di\u00a4erent impacts of marriage to a native by gender. These \u2026ndings are consistent with the large literature documenting that mother's characteristics are more in \u2021uential than father's characteristics in determining child outcomes. If the foreign born are more optimistic than the native born (Kao and Tienda 1995) and what really matters for child human capital acquisition is the mother's optimism, then the only important factor should be whether a child's mother is foreign born. This implies that a foreign born male's decision to marry a foreign born female should decrease dropout rates of his children while a foreign born female's decision to marry a foreign born male should have no e\u00a4ect on dropout rates. Similar stories can be told if children are more likely to be bilingual or have positive ethnic role models if their mothers are foreign born.\nTo examine whether these gender di\u00a4erences re \u2021ect causal relationships, I turn to the instrumental variables strategy discussed in the previous subsection. The same instrument is used, but because there are two endogenous variables in this model, the second excluded instrument is simply the interaction between being male and the proportion foreign born of the never married opposite-sex population in the immigrant's age group and state. Column 3 of Table 4 shows the IV estimates. The coe\u00a2 cient on native born spouse becomes positive and signi\u2026cant for foreign born females. Although the e\u00a4ect for males is slightly larger in magnitude, the di\u00a4erence between males and females is not statistically signi\u2026cant. This suggests that the di\u00a4erential impact of marriage to a native by gender can be explained by unobservable characteristics of either the foreign born females that choose to marry natives or the native born males that choose to marry immigrant females. These unobservable characteristics may be ambition or optimism in the child's future.\nWhen the endogeneity of the intermarriage decision is taken into account, marriage to a native has roughly the same e\u00a4ect on dropout rates of children regardless of whether the immigrant is male or female. "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This paper attempts to shed some light on the relationship between immigrants'marital assimilation and their children's academic success by examining the role of intermarriage in determining children's dropout rates. Previous literature suggests that an immigrant's marriage to a native improves children's academic outcomes, but the literature typically does not consider the fact that immigrants that marry natives have other characteristics which may a\u00a4ect child outcomes. This paper \u2026nds that although second-generation immigrants with one native parent generally have lower dropout rates than those with two foreign born parents, the relationship reverses when controls such as education and income are added to the model. The positive e\u00a4ect of marriage to a native on dropout probabilities of children increases slightly when controls for assimilation and country of birth \u2026xed e\u00a4ects are added to the model. Instrumental variables estimates also suggest that immigrants that marry natives have children that are more likely to dropout of high school than immigrants that marry other immigrants. It was also found that gender di\u00a4erences in the e\u00a4ect of marriage to a native disappear in speci\u2026cations which control for the endogeneity of the marriage decision.\nThese results can be interpreted as evidence that immigrants' association with natives is not unambiguously bene\u2026cial for assimilation. This is consistent with many newer theories of assimilation which, contrary to traditional \"straight line assimilation\" theories, posit that the ways in which immigrants assimilate depend on their speci\u2026c family and community circumstances (Alba and Nee 2003). Perreira et al. (2006) \u2026nd that Hispanic, Asian, and African immigrants that arrive in the US as children obtain more education than their parents, but that the second and higher generations do not do as well. They interpret this with a model in which cultural capital and immigrant optimism protect the young from the unfavorable community and school environments to which immigrants are typically exposed.\nCountries often explicitly place refugees in speci\u2026c parts of the country speci\u2026cally to hasten the speed of assimilation. Denmark recently enacted a policy which restricts the ability of immigrants to import spouses from their home countries. These types of policies may lead to more assimilation in some aspects such as language acquisition and earnings mobility. However, this paper suggests that marriage to a native, one measure of social integration, actually increases children's dropout rates when steps are taken to control for the characteristics, observable and unobservable, of the parents that choose to intermarry. This implies that resources should be spent on improving the community and school environments of immigrants and their children as opposed to spending resources trying to integrate immigrants into predominantly native communities. One caveat, however, is that this paper only considers one academic outcome of children. It may be that while native parents increase the probability that children drop out of high school, they may also increase the probability that children graduate from college. Examining the e\u00a4ects of intermarriage on other measures of child success remains an area ripe for future research."}]
