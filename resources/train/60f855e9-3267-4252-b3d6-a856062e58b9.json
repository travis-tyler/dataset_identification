In 'Toward Improving the Outcome of Pregnancy III,' Freda et al. 1 recommend that all mothers be screened for both postpartum depression (PPD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the first postpartum year.

In contrast, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology does not endorse universal screening but recommends that such screening should be strongly considered. 2 Both the American Academy of Pediatrics 3 and the American College of NurseMidwives 4 recommend screening for depression in women.

In many studies, NICU parents have reported elevated distress compared with parents of full-term, healthy infants. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Other studies without control groups have reported that substantial percentages of NICU parents exceed clinical cutoff scores on measures of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] This emotional distress generally decreases over time. 15 There is evidence, however, that there are different trajectories of recovery from potentially traumatic events. 5, 14 Social effects on mothers include financial strain and fewer years of subsequent education. 20 Most of these studies have involved only mothers. NICU fathers have also reported elevated distress. 16, 18, 21 PREVALENCE ESTIMATES Estimates of prevalence rates vary depending upon methods of assessment and populations surveyed. Our review is limited to depression and PTSD. Studies using interviews generally report lower prevalence rates than studies using questionnaires (Unless stated otherwise, prevalence figures reported in this paper reflect the percentage of mothers scoring above a cutoff on a questionnaire). Studies have used both general questionnaires (expressions of symptoms in general) and perinatal questionnaires."}, {"section_title": "DEPRESSION", "text": "The US National Comorbidity Survey-Revised (NCS-R) 22 reported 1-year estimates of prevalence rates for major depression in the general population of 8.6% for women and 4.9% for men.\nMothers can develop PPD at any time during the year after birth, although most cases occur in the first 6 months.\n1 A metaanalysis of 59 studies reported maternal PPD rates of 14% by self-report questionnaire and 12% by interview. 23 The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reviewed 30 studies of maternal depression. 24 This review, which used both depression questionnaires and interviews, reported point prevalence estimates for major depression from 1.0-5.9% during the first postpartum year. Studies that reported point prevalence rates for both major and minor depression found that the estimates ranged from 6.5 to 12.9%. Studies in this review also reported the average incidence estimates of a new episode of major depression during the first 3 months postpartum to be 6.5% (and 14.5% for a combination of major and minor depression).\nA recent meta-analysis 25 of 43 studies of depression in fathers during the prenatal and an 1-year postnatal period reported a depression rate of 10.4%, similar to the 10.0% PPD prevalence for fathers extracted from the large Early Childhood Longitudinal Study. 26 Studies of NICU mothers have reported higher prevalence rates of PPD. Two studies using the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) 27, 28 reported that 39% of NICU mothers scored above cutoff within the first week postpartum 10 and 40% at 1 month postpartum. 18 A study using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depressions scale (CES-D) 29 reported that 63% of NICU mothers had scores above cutoff at a time period in the NICU when their infant was off the ventilator. 15 A study using the Postpartum Depression Screening Scale 30 at 1 month postpartum reported that 39% of mothers scored above cutoff, whereas an additional 16.9% of mothers scored in the subclinical range. 18 A recent study of NICU fathers reported that 60% of fathers scored above cutoff on the CES-D at 7 days postpartum. 21 This rate declined to 36% on day 27."}, {"section_title": "POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS", "text": "The NCS-R 22 reported estimates of 1-year prevalence rates for PTSD (related to all potentially traumatic events; for example, terrorist attacks, serious vehicle accidents, and so on) using diagnostic interviews. These rates were 5.2% for women and 1.8% for men. A recent review of 12 studies used questionnaires to measure maternal PTSD symptoms from 1 to 14 months postpartum. 31 Some studies excluded high-risk births; other studies used unselected samples. The percentage of women scoring above cutoff on the questionnaires ranged from 0 to 14%, with a median of 2.05%. 31 This median is very close to the 2% postpartum PTSD prevalence rate considered by some as reflecting a consensus in the literature. 32 Three studies from different laboratories have reported larger percentages of NICU mothers scoring above cutoff on the Perinatal Post-traumatic Stress Questionnaire (PPQ) 6, 7 at different postpartum intervals: 23% shortly after birth, 10 24% at 6 months postpartum 17 and 26% at 18 months postpartum. 8 One study using the general Davidson Trauma Scale 33 reported that 9% of NICU mothers (and 33% of NICU fathers) attained scores reflecting a likely diagnosis of PTSD at 4 months postpartum. 16 An additional 55% of these mothers (and 67% of the fathers) scored at risk for PTSD. Another study using an interview assessment found that 53% of NICU mothers reported symptoms of all three PTSD symptom groups: re-experiencing, avoidance and heightened arousal. 13 A study using the PTSD Symptom Checklist 34 at 1 month postpartum reported that 15% of NICU mothers (and 8% of fathers) scored above cutoff, and an additional 11.7% of mothers (and 4% of fathers) scored in the subclinical range. 18 With the increased recognition of emotional distress in NICU parents, researchers have investigated the intergenerational consequences to the developing infant."}, {"section_title": "DEPRESSION CORRELATES", "text": "Maternal PPD in general has been shown to increase the risk of poorer cognitive development, disrupted behavioral functioning, impaired feeding and growth, and inappropriate use of healthcare services. 35 Other unfortunate correlates include disruptions in maternal interaction style, right frontal electroencephalograph asymmetry in children (a characteristic of adult depression) and insecure attachment. [36] [37] [38] A recent longitudinal study reported that 42% of the children of mothers with PPD during the early postpartum period were also evaluated as depressed through interviews by the age 16 years. 39 PPD in fathers has correlated with greater partner disharmony and higher rates of school-age oppositional defiant/conduct disorders. 40 Depressed fathers are also more likely to spank their 1-year-old children and less likely to consistently read to them. 41 Pervasive effects of PPD are seen in NICU mothers. Persistent PPD at 9 months postpartum predicted lower cognitive functioning in children at 16 months. 42 Negative maternal recollections of birth experiences predicted greater reports of internalizing and total problems at 5 years of age for preterm (but not full term) children. 43 In NICU parents, the impact of PPD may be heightened due to the increased medical and environmental risks. Subclinical depressive symptoms increase the risk of insecure attachment relationships in preterm infants, but not in term infants. 44 Maternal PPD (a) directly affects the quality of the infant-maternal interaction in preterm dyads, (b) leads to greater rates of insecure attachment and (c) increases the rate of distorted attachment representations in the mother. [45] [46] [47] POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS CORRELATES Prenatal PTSD symptoms predispose mothers to having high-risk infants who are lower in birth weight and gestational age. 48 Prenatal anxiety has also been associated with poorer cognition at 12 months in a general pregnancy population. 49 Maternal PTSD symptoms related to premature birth are associated with more controlling and less sensitive maternal behaviors.\n14,50 A maternal history of emotional distress may result in adverse caregiving, which could exacerbate later behavioral problems seen among preterms. Prematurity dyads in general show lower rates of both sensitive maternal style and cooperative infant interaction style at 6 months. These dyads were also at higher risk for sleeping, eating and behavioral problems at 18 months. 51 "}, {"section_title": "METHODS OF SCREENING", "text": "Psychometrically, all questionnaires for depression and PTSD described in this paper have adequate levels of reliability and validity. 52, 53 DEPRESSION SCREENING A quick screen from the US Preventive Services Task Force 54 involves asking parents two questions: \"Over the past 2 weeks:\nHave you ever felt down, depressed or hopeless?\" and Have you had little interest or little pleasure in doing things?\" 3 One 'Yes' answer constitutes a positive screen. One study of the quick screen reported a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 44%. 55 The CES-D 29 is a general screening tool that has been used in the postpartum period. 56 The CES-D is a 20-question instrument on which a score X16 (out of 30) is considered indicative of depressive symptoms.

Sensitivity and specificity have been reported to be between 84 and 94%, and 72 and 98%, respectively. 58, 59 Identifying the most appropriate screening instrument requires an assessment of population needs, as no single test is universally accepted. It may be important to consider cultural receptivity to the test. A review of the depression screening tools for adolescents concluded that there was no ideal instrument. This review recommended using both the CES-D and the EPDS because that combination could be used to evaluate the response to treatment and track the mental health status of women into adulthood. 60 "}, {"section_title": "POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS SCREENING", "text": "A quick Primary Care PTSD Screen has four general questions related to each symptom groups of PTSD.

[73] [74] [75] Multiple sources have advocated for such screening. 1, 3, 4 NICU parents are at higher risk for depression and PTSD than the general population. NICU parents are also more available for developing relationships that encourage screening, supportive interventions in the NICU and referral for treatment (if necessary). 35, 75 A difficulty often encountered is the lack of appropriate resources for managing NICU parents with elevated symptoms. If referral services are not available, then screening should not be initiated. It is important, however, to explore potential options for treatment resources thoroughly. NICUs are hospital-based, giving them access to other hospital services. Some NICUs have recruited unit-based psychologists, which has been especially helpful in children's hospitals where parents cannot be the patients. NICUs have also been able to work with the managed care organizations or government-supported safety net programs to identify mental health providers."}, {"section_title": "TIMING OF THE SCREENINGS", "text": "Advocates of family-centered NICU care recognize the benefits of creating a NICU environment that openly recognizes, normalizes and supports the heightened levels of emotional distress. 76 This atmosphere addresses the issue of stigma and communicates a commitment to the well-being of the whole family. In many of the studies mentioned above, questionnaires for PPD and PTSD have been administered in the NICU from 2 days postpartum through discharge. We advocate screening both mothers and fathers at intake, as this may be the only opportunity to screen parents with short NICU stays. Recent studies have shown that parents with short NICU stays report elevated levels of depression and anxiety. 11, 12 Ideally, the intake should also inquire about the physical and mental health histories of the parents.\nEarly screens may increase the risk of false positives (for example, potentially mistaking 'baby blues' for major depression), but false positives are much less costly for both the infant and the parents than false negatives (or failures to screen and intervene when necessary). It may be difficult to intervene for short-stay NICU parents, but the screening information can be communicated to subsequent caregivers. For NICU stays more than 10 to 14 days, we advocate re-screening both parents as part of the discharge planning process. Additional screenings should be done (a) when deemed appropriate, (b) during NICU infant follow-up visits and (c) during subsequent obstetric, pediatric and family practice visits."}, {"section_title": "INTERVENTIONS", "text": "Interventions should be adapted to the level of distress, which may change. In reviewing research on all potentially traumatic events, Bonanno et al. 5 identified four primary trajectories of recovery that likely apply to NICU parents: 'resilience', 'chronic', 'recovered' and 'delayed'. 'Resilience' is characterized by minimal symptoms and a relatively stable course of healthy functioning. "}, {"section_title": "Risk References", "text": "Prior mental health problems and traumas 10, 18, 65 Low social support (including marital status and level of partner support) 15, 66 Young age and less education in the mother 10, 15, 18 Non-white race and poverty (including recent immigration) 67, 68 Multiple births 69, 70 Objective measures of poor infant health [6] [7] [8] [9] 14, 17, 19, 67 Screening parents of high-risk infants MT Hynan et al 'Chronic' involves initial high-intensity symptoms and persistent major impairments. 'Delayed' and 'recovered', respectively, refer to immediate symptoms of moderate intensity that, over time, either increase in severity or decrease to normal. Re-screening during longer NICU stays is helpful in identifying a particular trajectory.\nIn longitudinal research on NICU mothers, Holditch-Davis et al.\n14 reported similar 'resilient' and 'chronic' trajectories across 6 data points over 2 years postpartum. Thirty-two percent of the sample followed the 'resilient' trajectory, with CES-D and PPQ scores over 2 years that would be expected from mothers who had delivered only healthy, term infants. At the other extreme, 20% of these mothers displayed 'chronic' levels of extreme distress in the NICU and afterward. Of this group, 44 to 57% had clinical-range CES-D scores from 6 through 24 months. At least 65% of this group had elevated PPQ scores at all the 6 data points. Holditch-Davis et al.\n14 speculated that this extreme group may have had undiagnosed mental health issues. The fact that Holditch-Davis et al.\n14 excluded mothers with a previous mental health history from their sample suggests that 420% of NICU mothers may need professional help for mental health problems. Twenty-seven percent of mothers in the Holditch-Davis et al.\n14 study followed the 'recovered' trajectory on the CES-D and a measure of state anxiety, whereas most of the remaining mothers displayed symptoms of moderate intensity for 2 years.\nIn our opinion, an initial positive screen may not require referral to a professional mental health provider. Clinical judgment accompanied by a consideration of other risk factors (for example, interruption of antidepressant medication during pregnancy) should determine the course of action. NICU parents with positive screens should be actively monitored in an emotionally and socially supportive environment. In general, positive shortinterview screens should be followed up with questionnaire screens or more thorough screens, such as the CLIP 46, 62 or PAT-NICU. 63, 64 A first screen with a highly sensitive instrument (such as the two-question depression screen) could be followed by a questionnaire with high specificity, which would reduce false positives.\nAll NICUs should have active psychosocial referral mechanisms for the B20 to 30% (or higher) of NICU parents likely to experience a diagnosable mental disorder in the first postpartum year. (The overall 1-year prevalence rate for a diagnosable mental disorder for individuals over 18 years of age in the United States is B26%. 77 ) Some NICUs provide counseling by NICU social workers or psychologists. In some instances, outpatient psychotherapy occurs in the NICU with therapists from the hospital's Behavioral Health program or other departments. After discharge, parents most at risk can be referred to other units of the hospital or outside clinics. Psychology departments in many cities have clinics that provide psychotherapy on a sliding fee scale. For high-risk infants qualifying for public insurance based on medical severity, the family may be able to obtain collateral services through infant-parent dyadic therapy.\nMost NICU parents will not require professional help, but do need increased levels of emotional support. Family-centered care, when delivered at high levels, can provide sufficient support to inoculate many vulnerable parents from psychopathology. There is ample support to recommend that the following be widely implemented: breastfeeding and kangaroo care, 78 education in developmental care and parenting competencies, [79] [80] [81] support networks (buddy systems) staffed by veteran NICU parents 82, 83 and counseling/therapy programs in the NICU. 84, 85 A recent systematic mapping review of a variety of NICU-based support programs cited in this paragraph reported that many had effective outcomes. 86 Moreover, a recent randomized control trial showed that outcomes for PPD were improved when management and treatment occurred within the practices that conducted the screening. 87 "}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "The discussion sections/conclusions of many of the research studies cited above have endorsed the need for screening, psychosocial support and referral (when necessary) for NICU parents. An implementation of their consensus may involve working backward. That is, both referral networks outside the NICU and psychosocial programs in the NICU should be functioning before the routine screening begins. We advocate taking these steps. We also recognize that implementing a screening program is likely to be easier in smaller NICUs. Larger NICUs may require staff dedicated to screening and referral.\nWe also offer a cautionary note. The NICU experience should not be portrayed as pathological for parents. Some NICU parents may feel that they are standing on the cliff of insanity. This notion should not be reinforced. One goal of establishing a screening program can be a normalization of emotional distress. Parents can be told that although very unfortunate, feelings of trauma, upset and hopelessness are typical in NICU. Cast in this manner, screening can be communicated as a commitment to the emotional well-being of parents both during the NICU and in their later family life.\nAdditional references are available as Supplementary Material with the online publication"}]
