[{"section_title": "", "text": "I n 2013, an estimated 837,900 individuals in the United States held research doctoral degrees in science, engineering, and health (SEH) fields, an increase of 4.0% from 2010. 2 Of these individuals, approximately 735,900 were in the labor force, which includes those employed full time or part time and those actively seeking work (i.e., unemployed). The unemployment rate for SEH doctorate recipients in the labor force was 2.1% in February 2013, down from 2.4% in October 2010 (table  1). Moreover, the 2013 unemployment rate of the SEH doctoral labor force was one-third of the February 2013 unemployment rate for the general population aged 25 years or older (6.3%). 3 These and other findings in this Info-Brief are from the 2013 Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR), which collects information from individuals who have earned research doctorates in SEH fields from U.S. academic institutions."}, {"section_title": "Employment Status", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Field of Doctoral Study and Years since Doctorate", "text": "Of the approximately 735,900 SEH doctoral degree holders in the labor force in 2013, about one-quarter (25.5%) had earned a doctorate in the biological, agricultural, or environmental life sciences; 18.5% had doctorates in engineering; 17.1% in physical sciences; 14.5% in psychology; 12.3% in social sciences; 4.6% in health; 4.5% in mathematics and statistics; and 3.0% in computer and information sciences (percentages derived from table 1). Unemployment rates of SEH doctorates in the labor force ranged from 1.2% for those who received doctorates in mathematics and statistics to 2.7% for those who received doctorates in the physical sciences. Of the total SEH doctoral population in February 2013, 87.8% was in the labor force, with 76.0% working full time and another 10.1% working part time (table 2). An additional 10.4% of the SEH doctoral population was retired in 2013, whereas the rest was not seeking work (1.7%). Across SEH degree fields, full-time employment ranged from 64.5% for psychology doctorates to 90.0% for computer and information sciences doctorates. Retirement and part-time work status differed by years since doctorate award. Those who earned their doctorates more than 25 years ago were, as expected, more likely than the younger cohorts to be retired and out of the labor force (32.1% in 2013) and to be working part time (15.9%) (table 2). 4 In contrast, years since doctorate award had no significant relationship with the unemployment rate. 5"}, {"section_title": "Demographics", "text": "Women continue to represent a growing share of doctorate holders, rising to 32.9% of all SEH doctorate holders in February 2013, from 31.5% in October 2010 and 30.2% in October 2008. In 2013, the labor force participation rate among SEH doctorate holders was 89.1% for women, compared with 87.2% for men (table 3). Female SEH doctorate holders were less likely than their male counterparts to be employed full time in 2013 (72.7% of women, 77.5% of men) and more likely not to be seeking work (3.7% of women, 0.8% of men). Female SEH doctorate holders, who as a group are younger than male SEH doctorate holders, were also less likely than their male counterparts to be retired (7.2% of women, 12.1% of men). In contrast, the proportions of female and male doctorate recipients  who reported themselves as unemployed in February 2013 were not significantly different (2.0% of women, 1.7% of men). A majority of the SEH doctoral population is white (73.0%), with Asians constituting the next largest group (19.0%). Within the SEH doctoral population, Hispanics or Latinos were employed full time at a higher rate than those who are not Hispanic or Latino (81.9% versus 75.7%). Among those who are not Hispanic or Latino, Asian doctorate holders exhibited a higher level of full-time employment (87.6%) than blacks or African Americans (79.9%), whites (72.4%), and those who reported more than one race (76.3%). Whites were more likely to be retired (12.7%) than were Hispanics or Latinos (4.5%), Asians (4.1%), blacks or African Americans (4.6%), and those reporting more than one race (8.2%) (table 3), reflecting the younger ages of the individuals in the SEH doctoral population who are not white. 6 In 2013, 3.4% of the SEH doctoral population held temporary visas (derived from table 3). As might be expected based on U.S. visa require-ments, almost all of these individuals (96.9%) were working full or part time; a small fraction was not in the labor force in February 2013 (1.7%).

For a listing of science, engineering, and health fields included in the 2013 Survey of Doctorate Recipients, see technical table B-1 at http://ncsesdata.nsf.gov/ doctoratework/2013/#tabs-2. 3. Unemployment statistics for the general population aged 25 years or older are published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and were obtained from http://www.bls.gov/news.release/ archives/empsit_03082013.htm (accessed 8 April 2014). The civilian unemployment rate for the population aged 16 years or older-the labor force measure as defined by BLS (http://www.bls.gov/ cps/cps_htgm.htm#concepts (accessed 7 May 2014)-in February 2013 was 7.7%, which is available at http://data.bls. gov/timeseries/LNS14000000 (accessed on 8 April 2014). Persons are classified as unemployed if they do not have a job, have actively looked for work in the prior 4 weeks, and are currently available for work. 4. The length of time since doctorate receipt is associated with age: the median age of those with more than 25 years since doctorate receipt is 65 years, and the median age of those with 25 or fewer years since doctorate receipt is 44 years. 5. Two measures of unemployment are used in this InfoBrief: (1) the unemployment rate as noted in table 1, which is based on the count of doctorate recipients in the labor force, and (2) the percentage unemployed as noted in tables 2 and 3, which is based on the count of all doctorate recipients, regardless of whether they are in the labor force. 6. Because of the small sizes of the populations of (1) American Indians or Alaska Natives and (2) Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders, statistically reliable comparisons between these two groups and others were not possible."}]
