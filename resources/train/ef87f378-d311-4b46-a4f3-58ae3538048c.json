This thesis seeks to characterize the impacts of storms on coastal ponds and marshes along the eastern coast of the United States. Tropical cyclones and other storms have been shown to cause a spectrum of effects on these coastal systems, ranging from widespread erosion to deposition of thick sediment deposits. Sediments deposited and preserved in coastal ponds and marshes can provide a proxy for tropical cyclone landfall, the development and interpretation of which is imperative to understanding past climate trends and informing decisions for the future. This thesis uses a variety of methods to quantify the spatiotemporal signatures of tropical cyclone events in coastal, marsh, bay, and pond systems in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Virginia. Trends in grain-size distribution and sediment coarse fraction are used to broaden our understanding of deposition and sediment sources during tropical cyclone events. The complexity of how storms interact with these systems requires a process-based, whole-site analysis to adequately develop a storm record. Given the many nuances to storm deposition in these systems (including reverse grading trends and apparent spatiotemporal variation in sediment source), the potential utility and caveats to inversely modeling storm intensity from deposit grain-size characteristics is discussed. Finally, the question of whether hurricanes can produce widespread erosion of marsh platforms is addressed through both field and modeling techniques. While storms typically deposit sediment, field evidence suggests that marshes have the potential to be eroded by a series of storms over time-a deviation from our traditional understanding of marsh evolution. Deposition and erosion of sediment during major storms remain complex, emphasizing the importance of contextualizing storm signatures within a broader view of the study area. This provides an opportunity to strengthen both paleo-reconstructions of storm activity and our ability to make informed decisions for coastal management in response to potential future changes in storminess.

The tropical cyclone dataset for the Atlantic basin extends quantitatively to the 1850s (Jarvinen et al., 1988) and qualitatively as far as 1492 C.E. through historic ship logs and personal accounts (Boose et al., 2001). Proxy records also can be used to reconstruct tropical cyclone activity, extending our understanding of tropical cyclone frequency and intensity millennia past historical records. Storminduced overwash deposits in coastal ponds and salt marshes, the primary signature explored in this thesis, are a reliable proxy for hurricane strikes along the eastern coast of the United States (Boldt et al., 2010;Donnelly et al., 2015;Woodruff et al., 2008). This thesis seeks to characterize the signatures of past tropical cyclones in coastal ponds and marshes along the eastern coast of the United States. A process-based interpretation of proxy records is imperative to understanding past climate trends and informing decisions for the future. This thesis uses a variety of methods in several different locations to: 1) quantify the spatiotemporal signatures of tropical cyclone events in these locations, 2) explore the potential for determining intensity from the grain sizes of these events, 3) investigate potential erosional signatures associated with hurricane events, and 4) model the accumulation and erosion of sediments during storm events. Chapter 3 explores the spatiotemporal trends of event beds in a coastal kettle pond in Falmouth, MA. Previous work has focused on a 2,000-year, event-frequency record from one sediment core in the basin (Donnelly et al., 2015). This chapter expands and updates the record using multiple cores along a -100m transect, as well as determines variations in grain-size distribution for several key events. Research questions guiding this chapter include: Donnelly et al. (2015)  Chapter 5 assesses the potential to inversely model storm intensity from the maximum grain size present in a deposit. The chapter presents an updated inverse modeling technique from those proposed by Woodruff et al. (2008) and Brandon et al. (2014), incorporating synthetic storm data for calibration. Data from the study sites of chapters 3 and 4 are used to explore both the utility and caveats of this approach. Research questions for this chapter include:\nMarshes have long been considered useful for their ecosystem service of coastal protection. Their roles in protection from storms and floods are seen as necessary and important to many coastal communities (Barbier et al., 2011;Butchart et al., 2005;Costanza et al., 1997;Morgan et al., 2009). Understanding the impacts that storms have on coastal ecosystems and adjacent coastal communities is imperative to increasing coastal resilience in the face of future increases in coastal flooding and associated damage (Pielke et al., 2008;Mendelsohn et al., 2012). Salt marshes have been lauded as buffers to storm surges, wind-generated waves, and elevated water levels (French, 2006;M61ler, 2012). The ecological restoration economy, which includes salt marsh restoration, in the United States alone generates $9.5 billion in annual economic output and employs an estimated 126,000 workers (BenDor et al., 2015). After Hurricane Sandy, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service spent more than $40 million on salt marsh restoration projects in response to this single event, including $11 million toward restoring a series of salt marshes along Long Island (US F&WS, 2017). Recent research reviewed in this chapter explores the impacts of storms on salt marsh erosion and accumulation, with an eye toward the utility of salt marshes for coastal protection in the face of rising sea levels and increasing storminess. Our review is primarily focused to the East and Gulf Coast of the United States as well as Europe. This is in part due to the concentration of researchers and the prevalence of marsh systems in these regions, compared to mangrove wetlands that tend to dominate the tropics (Fig. 2.1). Our review highlights the processes that occur in marshes resulting from storms ( Fig. 2.2), and provides insight into the future response of marshes to changes in storminess. The variability in storm impacts to marshes is largely based on both intensity and circumstance, with the potential for a spectrum of effects to be seen at a single marsh ( Fig. 2.3; Cahoon, 2006;Morton & Barras, 2011). Though marshes may be generally resilient to coastal flooding on larger spatial and temporal scales, storms may have more subtle impacts, causing cascading effects on a variety of smaller scales. A single storm may result in overwash that provides sediment to build the marsh in some sections, while wave activity and higher channel velocities increases marsh-edge erosion/retreat in other sections due to scarping, undercutting, and slumping ( Fig. 2.3). Given the prevalence of marshes worldwide and the likelihood of changes in storminess as climate changes (Walsh et al., 2016), it is important to understand the effectiveness of marshes in flood mitigation, as well as the role of storms in controlling marsh morphology. Our review begins with a discussion on the depositional record of storms in marshes, followed by an overview of modem storm impacts on marshes, and marsh attenuation of waves and storm surge.\nAs coastal populations continue to grow in both size and wealth, hurricanes pose a growing Hurricane Katrina was responsible for more than 1,100 deaths (Rappaport, 2014). The most comprehensive tropical cyclone dataset exists for the Atlantic basin, with quantitative records dating to the 1850s (Jarvinen et al., 1988) and historic records from ship logs and personal accounts dating back as far as 1492 C.E. (Ludlum, 1963). In New England, historic accounts of tropical cyclone landfalls extend as far as 1620 C.E. (Boose et al., 2001). To better understand tropical cyclone frequency and intensity before historic records, however, we must turn to proxy records. Proxy records can be used to reconstruct millennia of tropical cyclone activity and are imperative for understanding the climate drivers that result in changes in tropical cyclone activity. Storm-induced overwash deposits in coastal ponds and salt marshes have been used as a proxy for hurricane strikes in southeastern New England (Boldt et al., 2010;Donnelly et al., 2001a;Donnelly et al., 2015;Woodruff et al., 2008). Large storms produce wave heights, storm surge, and run up significant enough to overtop sandy barriers. Coarse sediment is transported and deposited in relatively deep coastal basins or on top of salt marsh peat as an overwash layer. This layer is then preserved as a stratigraphically-distinct allochthonous layer after it is covered by finer-grained organic material or peat as part of background accumulation. Other studies have also identified storm-induced overwash sequences in the geologic record, including deposits in Florida (Davis et al., 1989) and Alabama (Liu & Feam, 1993), as well as in southern New England (Emery, 1969;Boothroyd et al., 1985;). Recent research has identified a series of active intervals in southeastem New England over the past 2,000 years, with the last few centuries among the most quiescent intervals (Donnelly et al.,  Understanding grain-size and sorting characteristics and trends is necessary to characterize hurricaneinduced deposition at the study site. Exploring historic and prehistoric intervals of increased hurricane frequency and the grain-size dynamics associated with their events illuminates a process-based understanding of how these event beds were deposited, which in turn enables more robust interpretations of paleo-hurricane records.\nAs coastal population continues to grow in both size and wealth, hurricanes pose a growing threat to livelihood and infrastructure along the coast. Recent research has explored the influence of a changing climate on hurricane frequency, intensity, genesis location, and track. While most assessments agree that an increase in sea surface temperatures should indicate an increase in the intensity of tropical cyclones (Emanuel, 2008;Holland & Webster, 2007;Sobel et al., 2016;Walsh et al., 2016), natural variability and confounding factors complicate the hurricane-climate connection.  (Jarvinen et al., 1988), making it the most comprehensive tropical cyclone dataset. Historical records for the Atlantic extend as far back as 1492 C.E. (Ludlum, 1963). In New England, the historical record extends as far back as 1620 C.E. (Boose et al., 2001). Since our instrumental and historical records are too short to understand interactions between tropical cyclones and climate on a longer (multidecadal to centennial to millennial) scale, proxy records are imperative for reconstructing millennia of tropical cyclone impacts. Storm-induced overwash deposits in coastal ponds and salt marshes have been used to augment our understanding of hurricane strikes in southeastem New England (Boldt et al., 2010;Donnelly et al., 2001a;Donnelly et al., 2015;Woodruff et al., 2008). Large storms can produce storm surge and wave heights significant enough to overtop sandy barriers, transporting and depositing coarse sediment in deep coastal basins or on top of salt marsh peat. This overwash layer is then covered by finer-grained organic material or peat, preserving the storm event as a stratigraphicallydistinct allochthonous layer. Donnelly et al. (2001a)  Other studies have also identified sequences in the geologic record as due to large storms, including deposits in Florida (Davis et al., 1989) and Alabama (Liu & Feam, 1993), as well as in southem New England (Boothroyd et al., 1985). 2) examine lateral sorting trends, and 3) compare the grain size characteristics of historic event beds with prehistoric event beds. Understanding these characteristics and trends is imperative to further exploring the complexities inherent in hurricane-induced sediment deposition.\nRecords of hurricane-induced overwash deposits have long constrained tropical cyclone frequency (e.g. Boldt et al., 2010;Donnelly et al., , 2015van Hengstum et al., 2014;Liu & Fearn, 1993), revealing varying trends in hurricane activity both regionally and historically. More recent research has attempted to estimate the intensity of the storms responsible for these deposits (Brandon et al., 2013(Brandon et al., , 2014Woodruff et al., 2008). The inverse hurricane modeling techniques developed by Following the advective-settling model described by Woodruff et al. (2008), a relationship exists among the maximum grain size of a storm deposit, the distance the grain traveled inland from the barrier, and the wind and resulting wave conditions necessary to cause that travel. As waves overwash the barrier during large-scale inundation events, observational and experimental data (C. Donnelly et al., 2006) suggest that flow on the backside of a barrier can becomes supercritical-the flow velocity is larger than the wave velocity. During extreme inundation conditions, the sediment transport may also be dominated by suspended load (C. Donnelly et al., 2006). Given a sizable reduction in turbulence between the barrier and the area behind it, it is thought that advective settling of the sediment plays a larger role in the ultimate transport of the sediment grains than turbulent resuspension at a critical distance landward (Woodruff et al., 2008). Through a series of settlingvelocity equations and empirically derived relationships between wave-runup and off-shore winds, it is possible to tentatively reconstruct the offshore wind and wave characteristics of a given storm. These inverse modeling techniques make several assumptions in their various applications. The advective-settling model proposed by Woodruff et al. (2008) assumes that transport occurs as inflow from a tidal bore travelling over a sandy barrier and into an adjacent pond or lagoon, at which point there is a significant reduction in both velocity and turbulence. For this reason, settling of siliciclastic sediment is considered more important than turbulent resuspension in the system. There still remains, however, a distance from the barrier before which the influence of settling overtakes the influence of turbulence. This does not account for changes or differences in sediment supply or source, such as deposition from aeolian transport or sediment sourced from marsh channels or pond edges. The model also does not account for the influence of a surge-dominated wave regime during storms (such as if the surge completely inundates the barrier) and assumes that majority of the sediment transport occurs during wave-dominated regimes. Here, we test the applicability of this inverse modeling approach applied to overwash deposits in two different environments in coastal New England. An updated inverse modeling technique from Further investigation suggests that grain-size and deposition trends in these environments are more complex and nuanced than originally assumed. Application of the inverse modeling technique, therefore, needs to be assessed on a site-by-site base and potentially for a variety of storm conditions. The inverse modeling technique, even in its updated form presented here, has several caveats that must be considered before extending its use beyond the sites considered.\nIn 2006, van de Plassche et al. posited that intense storms may be responsible for a curious stratigraphic sequence found in Pattagansett Marsh, Niantic, CT. Through extensive coring of the marsh, the authors identify an approximately 900-year hiatus associated with a widespread portion of the marsh that appears to be quickly infilled with tidal mud, which then transitions to low and high marsh peat-a small-scale complete transition from original marsh system to mud flat to marsh system. The authors dated the hiatus along one transect to the mid-seventeenth century, consistent with the timing of the 1635 Great Colonial Hurricane. Despite limited replication in other New England salt marshes (van de Plassche et al., 2004) and lack of a modern analog, the authors ruled out the influence of a variety of factors known to cause erosion in salt marshes, including an increase in tidal range (Long et al., 2006), gradual migration of tidal channels (Stumpf, 1983), background rates of marsh-cliff retreat (McLoughlin et al., 2015), marsh pond formation (Wilson et al., 2009), and changes in sea level (Schwimmer & Pizzuto, 2000). Here, we test the hypothesis presented by van de Plassche et al. Given the storm-buffering capacity of salt marshes and their tendency to accumulate sediment during storms (Castagno et al., 2018), the pervasive erosion seen at this site may mark a departure from our current understanding of 's model of salt marsh evolution, form, and function. This is of particular importance as intense hurricanes, augmented by rising sea levels, are expected to pose a greater threat of property damage and loss of life over the next century (Sobel et al., 2016;Walsh et al., 2016;Woodruff et al., 2013).\nCoastal bays and barrier island systems provide a variety of ecosystem services and play an integral role in protecting coastal communities from flooding and other destruction associated with coastal storms, including hurricanes and extratropical cyclones (Barbier et al., 2011). Communities are growing increasingly vulnerable to flooding from tropical cyclones and other storms due to increases in sea-level rise (Woodruff et al., 2013), and continuing greenhouse gas-forced warming may augment tropical cyclone intensity and frequency (Sobel et al., 2016;Walsh et al., 2016). Coastal bays must trap sediments so that tidal flats and salt marshes can accrete and maintain the same elevation with respect to mean sea level, allowing the system to keep pace with sea-level rise and avoid drowning (Fagherazzi et al., 2014). Though marshes have been shown to be resilient to periods of moderate sea-level rise (Kirwan et al., 2010(Kirwan et al., , 2016, accelerated sea-level rise can cause marsh drowning and destruction (FitzGerald et al., 2008;Kirwan et al., 2010). Wave attack from intense storms has been shown to cause significant erosion (Barras, 2007;Howes et al., 2010;van de Koppel et al., 2005;Morton & Barras, 2011), but overwash and other deposition from intense storms have also been suggested as a major source of resilience-building sediment (Donnelly et al., 2001a;Morton & Barras, 2011;Turner et al., 2006;Walters & Kirwan, 2016). Developing a sediment budget for these coastal bays is imperative to understanding how storm events in a regime of accelerated sea-level rise affect the resilience of the system, where net import of sediment indicates growth and increasing stability of the system and net export of sediment indicates deterioration (Fagherazzi et al., 2014;Ganju et al., 2015). In this study, we quantify the sediment fluxes into and out of coastal bays during storms to test the hypothesis that more frequent and intense storms will erode and deteriorate these valuable ecosystems. We focus this study on the Virginia Coast Reserve (VCR), a system of salt marshes and shallow back-barrier tidal bays along the Atlantic side of the Delmarva Peninsula (Fig. 7.1a) because this reach is one of the longest expanses of undeveloped mixed-energy barrier islands worldwide (which controls for anthropogenic impacts) and experiences high rates of relative sea-level rise (which provides an upper-bound for expected marsh demise) (Fenster et al., 2016). The VCR is composed of a system of shallow bays fringed by Spartina alterflora marshes, which cover approximately 30% of the total surface area of the system (Fagherazzi & Wiberg, 2009;Oertel, 2001). The system has a mean tidal range of 1.2m, and storms are a primary cause of short-term disturbance in the area (Fagherazzi & Wiberg, 2009;McLoughlin et al., 2015). The system lacks a significant riverine sediment source. Previous research in the VCR has included quantifying the main contributors to salt marsh erosion, a major threat to marsh ecosystem services. Though wave action is the main contributor to erosion (Fagherazzi & Wiberg, 2009;McLoughlin et al., 2015), vegetation changes and invertebrate burrowing also play a large role (Thomas & Blum, 2010). Previous geomorphic modeling in this location has focused on developing numerical models for marsh evolution (Fagherazzi et al., 2012;Mariotti & Carr, 2013), detailing how waves shape marsh form and function (Leonardi & Fagherazzi, 2014;, and quantifying how barrier islands and marshes interact (Deaton et al., 2016;Walters et al., 2014). Given the robust nature of previous research in the VCR, it is an ideal location to formulate a sediment budget to determine the supply of sediment to the tidal bays and their resilience in the face of sealevel rise and increasing storminess."}, {"section_title": "Is the hurcane recordpresented by", "text": "1.

With respect to accretion, storm-induced overwash deposits in salt marshes have been used to augment our understanding of hurricane strikes (e.g., Boldt et al., 2010;Donnelly et al., 2001aDonnelly et al., , 2001b. Elevated water levels from storm surge and waves can be significant enough to overtop sandy barriers, transporting and depositing coarse sediment on top of salt marsh peat. During the years following the storm, organic material accumulates/grows over the associated overwash layer, thus preserving the storm event as a stratigraphically-distinct allochthonous layer. Donnelly et al. (2001b) described this sedimentary pattern in a salt marsh in southern Rhode Island (Fig. 2.4a). At this salt marsh, aerial photos after major hurricanes in 1938 and 1954 confirm overwash fans deposited by the events. These overwash fans, along with four older deposits, were confirmed in a series of 14 sediment cores, suggesting that several intense hurricanes had impacted the area since 1635. Other studies have also identified storm-induced deposits in marsh, including in the Gulf of Mexico (Williams, 2012), South Carolina (Hippensteel, 2008;Hippensteel & Martin, 1999), and Georgia (Kiage et al., 2011). For a complete database of paleo-storm reconstructions from marshes and other back-barrier environments please see recent reviews by Oliva et al. (2018) and Muller et al. (2017). van de Plassche et al. (1999, 2004 proposed that intense storms (under a specific, yet unknown, combination of conditions) may be the cause of preserved stratigraphic evidence of widespread erosional events in a Connecticut salt marsh. At Pattagansett River Marsh, two distinct erosional events were discovered (van de Plassche et al., 2006), where the portion of the marsh that had been eroded appeared to have been quickly infilled with tidal mud, which then transitioned to low and then high marsh peat. This was interpreted to represent a small-scale complete transition from marsh to tidal creek/mudflat system then back to a low-to-high marsh again. Though storms have been shown to cause smaller, localized erosional events, the large-scale unconformities observed by van de Plassche et al. (on the order of >100m 2 ) were surprising. Erosion of this scale has not been documented in modem salt marshes, and did not appear to have deposited large blocks of excavated peat elsewhere. van de Plassche et al. (2006) found that the dates of their two identified erosional events corresponded with the age ranges of known hurricane deposits found at another salt marsh approximately 60 kilometers away (Donnelly et al., 2001a), including a hurricane in 1635, which is considered by many to be the most intense hurricane in the historical record to impact southern New England (Boose et al., 2001;Ludlum, 1963). Nikitina et al. (2014) expanded on the van de Plassche et al. (2006) research with sedimentary evidence of potential storm erosion from more than 200 gouge cores along seven transects in a salt marsh in New Jersey. The authors documented similar depositional sequences as those seen by van de Plassche et al. (2006) across great swathes of marsh: in at least seven sequences, there were abrupt contacts between salt marsh peat and overlying intertidal mud, suggesting that the underlying peat was eroded and then rapidly infilled by tidal mud (Fig. 2.5f). Though the authors suggested several different processes that may produce these sequences, they developed a chronology that suggested that these events may have correlated with historic and prehistoric tropical cyclone events observed previously in the northeast (Donnelly et al., 2001b). The authors proposed that the most recent episodes of marsh erosion may correlate with tropical cyclones in 1903 AD, 1821/1788 AD, and 1635"}, {"section_title": "AD.", "text": "Erosional features in marsh stratigraphy are attributed to storms largely through the discrediting of other potential mechanisms (Nikitina et al., 2014). Alternative explanations for the intertidal mud deposits overlying high marsh peat include an increase in tidal range (Long et al., 2006), gradual migration of tidal channels (Stumpf, 1983), background rates of marsh-cliff retreat (McLoughlin et al., 2015), marsh pond formation (Wilson et al., 2009), and changes in sea level (Schwimmer & Pizzuto, 2000). Migration of tidal channels was ruled out in the Nikitina et al (2014) study since tidal creeks are generally considered stable over long timescales , and the process of tidal creek migration in the case of stabilizing vegetation loss is a slow time-transgressive process that would not result in the observed sharp contacts (Stumpf, 1983). Though many marshes have been extensively ditched for mosquito control since the 1800s and the erosive contacts may represent infilling of ditches, the authors suggest that would limit those contacts to post-1800, which is not observed in the record. Such erosive sequences would then also be common across many marshes-an observation also not seen as yet. Salt pans, which form either from marsh growing around a tidal depression or after significant vegetation disturbance (Wilson et al., 2009), have a similar stratigraphic signature to that seen by Nikitina et al. (2014) and van de Plassche et al. (2006). The authors assert, however, that the stratigraphic sequences seen in their study site appear to be laterally continuous across large areas of the marsh. This observation is more consistent with a major erosional event than a localized salt pan. Additionally, while most of these ruled-out processes occur over longer timescales, higher-energy events could also be responsible for more rapid changes in tidal range, channel geometry, or cliff erosion, among others. It is important to consider why the Nikitina et al. (2014) and van de Plassche et al. (2006) studies observed evidence of wide-spread marsh erosion that they attribute to hurricanes when other marshes in the vicinity do not (e.g. Donnelly et al., 2001a;Donnelly, 2004;Miller et al., 2009). A variety of factors-including sampling biases, marsh geomorphology, marsh composition, storm track, and storm intensity-may play roles in observing eroding or depositing sediment in different locations or at different times. Indeed, sediment cores from marshes in New England suggest that a given location can experience both depositional and erosional events ( Fig. 2.6). While the extensive erosion of marsh platforms by intense hurricanes remains an explanation for the features mapped in these marshes, the physical processes of erosion and the character and magnitude of the storms potentially responsible remains elusive. Smaller scale erosional processes have been observed historically and therefore the mechanisms responsible for them are better understood. Analysis of paleorecords shows that salt marshes and intense storm events have coexisted for thousands of years. Boldt et al. (2010) identified 30 distinct storm events (including seven historical severe landfalling hurricanes) over the past 2,000 years in a sediment core collected from a salt marsh in Mattapoisett, MA (Fig. 2.7). Though there have been periods of increased hurricane activity and quiescence in the last two millennia (Donnelly et al., 2015), cores from Mattapoisett suggest continuous marsh development. Despite significant variability in both storminess and storm impact over the past millennia ( Fig. 8a and 8c), sea levels have remained relatively stable (Fig. 2.8b and 2.8d), with the most notable increase in global sea levels occurring in the last 150 years (Donnelly et al., 2015;Kemp et al., 2014Kemp et al., , 2015Kopp et al., 2016;Lane et al., 2011;Fig. 2.8e). Tandem increases in sea levels and storminess may serve to multiply marsh vulnerability. The paleorecord shows that patterns of and mechanisms for erosion or deposition from intense storms are complex. These pattems and mechanisms will be explored in more detail in the following section on modern processes."}, {"section_title": "Modern storm impacts on marshes", "text": "To determine the modem impacts of storm events on marshes, one must first consider the factors that contribute to marsh stability ( Fig. 2.9). Here, we provide an abbreviated review on the topic specific to storm impacts. A series of biological and physical feedbacks allow marshes to vertically keep pace with sea-level rise. Following Redfield's bi-directional model of salt marsh evolution (Redfield, 1965), as sea level rises and organic material and clastic sediment accumulates on the marsh, the marsh accretes vertically over basement material or mudflats (Fig. 2.2). Following the model described by Stumpf (1983), deposition of sediment on the marsh occurs predominantly with tidal flooding. As water from tidal currents floods the marsh surface, marsh vegetation slows the currents, trapping suspended sediment (Postma, 1961). In addition to regular tidal flooding, storms can be a major source of sediment for the marsh (Donnelly, 2004;Donnelly et al., 2001a;Turner et al., 2006;Walters et al., 2014;Walters & Kirwan, 2016;Fig. 2.4). Large storms can produce storm surge and wave heights significant enough to overtop sandy barriers, transporting and depositing coarse sediment on top of salt marsh peat. Highly turbid water from storms can also be carried into the marsh via creek networks along the back side of the marsh (Schuerch et al., 2013). Kolker et al. (2009) found a strong correlation between short-term sea-level change (e.g., storms) and increased accretion in marshes in Long Island, NY. Stumpf (1983) proposed that total sedimentation is from a combination of tidal and storm sources, with storms controlling sediment supply and movement on smaller time scales than daily tidal flooding, when considered over decades or centuries. Though flooding during storms has documented impacts on marshes, in some cases very high storm surges over a marsh may actually help protect its surface from both erosion and accumulation of sediment. Elsey-Quirk (2016) measured the impacts of Hurricane Sandy (2012) on salt marshes in New Jersey, finding only localized and temporary marsh elevation changes and disturbances, despite Sandy making direct landfall. Similar conditions were seen after Hurricane Hugo (1989) in a salt marsh in South Carolina (Gardner et al., 1992). In both cases, the perpendicular coastal approach by both storms resulted in significant storm surges. The surge completely inundated the marsh, such that sediment associated with the surge was deposited more inland, being transported over and bypassing much of the marsh surface. Storm waves on top of the deep surge caused minimal erosion along the marsh surface or edge. The marsh edge is subjected to constant stress from wind, waves, and currents. Field and model observations confirm that how a marsh edge erodes depends largely on the type of waves to which it is exposed. Leonardi and Fagherazzi (2014) found that, on small spatial scales, high storm wave energy conditions erode marsh boundaries uniformly, whereas low wave energy conditions result in a jagged erosion pattern-largely due to the influence of local marsh resistance. On larger, wholemarsh scales, boundaries of rapidly-eroding marshes are significantly smoother than those of sheltered or slowly-eroding marshes, though marshes experiencing low-wave energy conditions may be more susceptible to increased large, isolated failures Priestas et al., 2015). There does not appear to be a threshold of wave power over which marsh erosion accelerates drastically. For example,  identified a linear relationship between salt marsh erosion and wave power and determined that wind speeds associated with moderate storms (1.6-10.7 m/s) are associated with the greatest amounts of marsh deterioration due to their higher frequency of occurrence. In contrast, extreme wind speeds associated with rarer and more violent storms and hurricanes (>28.5 m/s) contribute less than 1% of long-term marsh deterioration along the lateral plane. Due to short observational periods, however, studies such as  may miss more intense (e.g., > 50 m/s), relatively rare events. Morton and Barras (2011) explored patterns of wedand erosion and deposition following major hurricanes in southern Louisiana. The authors determined-through analysis of aerial photography, satellite imagery, and on the ground mapping-several depositional features associated with major storms, including wrack zones, interior-marsh deposits, and shoreline deposits. If a storm does not deposit an extremely thick wrack or sediment layer, which would kill supportive vegetation, Katrina and Rita, for example, increased the water area in coastal Louisiana by 230 km 2 and 295 km 2 , respectively (Barras, 2007). Most substantially, ponds expanded or created by hurricane erosion tended to become permanent features-increasing the open water area substantially across southern Louisiana. Contrary to the previously mentioned findings of , Barras (2007) asserts that storm-related erosion is the primary natural process by which marshes in southern Louisiana degrade, especially since the self-healing capabilities of marsh systems using sediment and nutrients from the Mississippi delta system have been hindered since land development in the late 19* century. Barras (2007) suggests that increased wetland loss will increase overall vulnerability of southern Louisiana marshes to extreme storms, particularly in seasons with multiple storms, but the difficulty in predicting where and when extreme landfalls will occur makes it challenging to predict loss in specific areas at specific rates. Many of these marshes experiencing losses were fresh to brackish marshes, also emphasizing the importance of salinity for storm resilience (Howes et al., 2010). Howes et al. (2010) determined that 2005 Hurricanes Katrina and Rita eroded more than 500 km 2 of wetlands within coastal Louisiana. Higher-salinity marshes were found to be more resilient to erosion than lower-salinity marshes, with lower-salinity marshes preferentially failing. Using field and lab measurements of soil strength, lower-salinity marshes were found to have a weak zone approximately 30 cm below the marsh surface (with shear strengths between 500 and 1450 Pa). Higher-salinity marshes had no documented weak zones, with shear strengths greater than 4500 Pa throughout the entire soil profile. Though controlled by a variety of factors, the difference is likely due to vegetation-S. alterflora marshes are more tolerant to increased salinities, with more substantial, deeper root systems than less-saline marshes dominated by S.patens. The authors suggest that this research may have broader implications for current freshwater diversion plans. For example, the introduction of freshwater to marsh systems may decrease their resilience to large storms by creating weak zones within the marsh soil more susceptible to erosion. As seen in the Howes (2010) study, variations in vegetation assemblage influence both sediment capture and platform stabilization, and such differences in vegetation are controlled by several factors that include salinity, tidal range, wave energy, and climatic setting (Frey and Basan, 1978). In addition to the findings of Howes et al. (2010), Snedden et al. (2014) found a negative relationship between the duration of flood inundation during an experimental mesocosm study of above-and below-ground Spartina biomass in the Mississippi deltaic plain, as did Watson et al. (2017) in southern New England marshes. M611er (2012) explored how individual plants can act as erosional agents, discovering that a stand of Salicornia spp. within a Sparina marsh may be responsible for largescale bank failure in Tillingham, Essex, UK (Fig. 2.5b). These individual plants can interact with waves, causing small scale erosion at the plant scale, which, when extended to each individual plant within a stand, can lead to erosion on massive scales. Goodbred and Hine (1995) explored the impacts of the March 1993 \"Storm of the Century\" in a J. roemeianus-dominated marsh in west-central Florida, where despite storm surges nearing 3 m and deposition of up to 2 cm of sediment on the marsh, there was minimal marsh shoreline erosion. The authors attribute this to increased sediment stabilization from dense J. roemeranius root mats, as well as decreased surface erosion from a reduction in near-bed flow velocities by its canopy (L. A. . Tate and Battaglia (2013), however, found J. roemaranius to be vulnerable to storm surge and wrack deposition in an experimental set up in a marsh on the Florida panhandle. Using a three-dimensional hydrodynamic and sediment transport model for a salt marsh in the Netherlands, Temmerman et al. (2005) found that vegetative impacts on flow velocity may influence The positive feedback between vegetation growth and sediment accumulation, such as that described by Temmerman et al. (2005) among others, continues until the marsh reaches a critical state where marsh edge grows so steep that it is particularly vulnerable to erosion by storm waves. As the marsh collapses, it forms a scarp, which can retreat inland even in the absence of storm stress. The composition of the marsh sediment also plays a role in scarp retreat. Allen (1989) explored how sandy and muddy marsh scarp systems in west-coast British estuaries responded to wave attack. They found that muddy marsh systems in the Severn Estuary were more resilient to storm waves due to increased cohesion, often reach 5-10m in height, and only experience small cantilever failures after strong storms. Sandier marsh systems in Solway Firth and Morecambe Bay more frequently experience toppling and cantilever failures, with much of the soil strength limited to the first 10-20 cm of rootdominated sediment. Baustian and Mendelssohn (2015) analyzed the recovery rate of plant cover in coastal Louisiana salt marshes following Hurricanes Gustav and Ike (2008). To determine marsh resilience in the absence of stabilizing vegetation, the study followed control and experimentally-disturbed plots (treated with herbicide), and quarterly monitored rate of recovery-both prior to and after the impact of the 2008 hurricanes. The authors found that hurricane-induced sedimentation was highly correlated with above ground primary vegetative production and increased recovery rates after the disturbance. The sedimentation from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike was found to increase the vigor of the vegetation in the experimental plots and, overall, increase marsh resilience. Though the authors acknowledge marsh destruction from the two hurricanes studied, they suggest that increased sedimentation may be beneficial in locally increasing marsh resilience to long-term sea-level rise and future storms. A marsh requires sediment to accrete fast enough to ensure resilience to rising sea level. Walters and Kirwan (2016) suggest that overwash from hurricane waves actually may be responsible for increasing marsh resilience, citing an optimal thickness of deposit to maximize vegetation productivity, above which vegetation death begins to occur. Using a series of mesocosms to simulate a range of burial scenarios of Spartina alterniflora in a marsh in the Virginia Coast Reserve, the authors found that, though major overwash events (>10 cm) may cause marsh loss, smaller, more regular storm events (between 5-10 cm of overwash) contribute to the continued resilience of these marshes. Turner et al. (2006) investigated the accumulation of inorganic sediment on coastal wetlands of Louisiana from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and found that accumulation exceeded 131 x 10metric tons over more than 38,500 km 2 , with an average thickness of 5.18 cm. Sediment was not equally distributed throughout the marshes, with almost 5 m of storm surge depositing >10 cm of inorganic mud in some regions. Analyzing the spatial distribution and amount of sediment, the authors determine that major storm action is the dominant pathway by which offshore inorganic sediment moves inshore onto the coastal marshes of Louisiana. Burkett et al. (2007), however, suggest that this study fails to take into consideration the significant erosion that also occurred during these major storms, and did not adequately discern the true fluvial source of sediment sampled. elsewhere (Allison & Kepple, 2001;Hu et al., 2018) remains well documented and modeled, and attempts at developing a sediment budget of a marsh system over the course of a storm are necessary to understand the dynamics and impacts of major storms on these systems (Ganju et al., 2015). Storm sediment dynamics play a large role in the elevation of a marsh, which ultimately determines its resilience. Marsh elevation is a controlling factor in several ecogeomorphic feedbacks, including vegetation establishment, growth, and survival (Cahoon, 2006 Orton et al. (2015) found that the presence of these deep channels effectively short circuited the ability of the marsh to reduce storm surge, and that channel infilling would be far more beneficial for storm surge attenuation than the restoration of surrounding marshes, particularly for fast-moving events. Marsooli et al. to play a significant role in shoreline stabilization. Although many studies focus on the utility of vegetation to attenuate high wave energy, a study by Feagin et al. (2009) suggests that soil type may be more influential than vegetation cover, with humic soils richer in fine-grained organics more resistant to erosion than soils rich in coarse-grained organics like roots or other plant debris. This is also consistent with the earlier mentioned study by Allen (1989), which showed a higher degree of stability for mud-dominated when compared to sand-dominated marshes. Vegetation, however, does play a major role in these soil parameters, so it is important to consider how marsh ecosystem maintenance, restoration, and creation can continue to develop sustainable and ecologically-sound coastal protection (Temmerman et al., 2013)."}, {"section_title": "Marsh attenuation of storm waves and surge", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Regional setting", "text": "Storms are a natural component of most ecological systems. Though paleorecords show significant variability in both storminess and storm impact, coastal salt marshes have thrived since their development over the Holocene (Engelhart et al., 2009;Shennan & Horton, 2002). Intense storms have the capacity to dynamically impact marshes-particularly at meso-and microscales-but marshes also have the capacity to adapt and adjust to storm-induced changes, provided they have room to migrate. These dynamic impacts may be erosion of the marsh, accumulation of sediment on the marsh, or, more likely, a combination of both. Through the last several millennia, storm climate has varied considerably (Brandon et al., 2013;Donnelly et al., 2015), sea level has remained relatively stable (Kemp et al., 2014(Kemp et al., , 2015 interplay among all of these properties dictate the impact of a particular storm on a given marsh, and different impacts from the same storm may be seen at the same marsh or proximal marshes."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "The appreciation of marshes for their storm protection and erosion control services continues to grow and is largely responsible for over an order of magnitude increase in the appraised value of tidal marshes in recent decades (e.g. from $14k to $194k /ha/yr between 1997 and 2014; Costanza et al., 2014). Critical to this increase in value is the perceived effectiveness of marshes in storm protection. Marsh sediments preserve evidence of storm-induced erosion and deposition that has and should continue to be utilized to gain more insight on both early historic and pre-historic storm events. This sedimentological evidence of past storm events also exhibits a high degree of spatial variability, both in terms of deposition and erosion. Studies of modern marsh processes confirm the spatial temporal variance in marsh response to storms. When depositional conditions occur, recent research indicates that storms can be a valuable mechanism for marsh resilience to sea-level rise. However, erosion primarily on the marsh edge causes systems in open water to be in a continued state of flux. Minor and moderate storms have been found to largely be responsible for most marsh edge erosion, although catastrophic loss from more intense events has the potential to significantly modify a marsh system. The diversity of responses and rates of erosion and accretion of different marshes during storms also highlight the importance that vegetative species and sediment composition play. The effectiveness of marshes as a form of flood mitigation is an area of active research. It is clear that marshes provide an effective means of wave attenuation; however, the capacity of these systems to reduce storm surge varies significantly from site to site. As investments in ecosystemdefenses continue to grow, so should research on marsh-storm relationships. Of particular importance are the spatial and temporal factors that determine a marsh's effectiveness in storm flood mitigation, as it is likely that costs and benefits will vary widely depending on the specific setting.

Sieved samples were analyzed using a Horiba Camsizer digital image processing particle, size, and shape analyzer at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Since there is potential for variability in each run, each sample was run 3-5 times and averaged after removing inconsistent runs. Do, the size for which 90% of the particles in the size distribution are smaller, is used as a metric for the maximum grain size. As discussed by Brandon et al.

The 64-acre marsh is connected to Long Island Sound via the Pattagansett River (Fig. 6.1). Located too far upstream (~2 km) for storm waves to leave overwash deposits directly by overtopping a sandy barrier (Boldt et al., 2010;Donnelly et al., 2001a) The marsh has several shallow ponds and was anthropogenically ditched prior to the mid-twentieth century, likely for mosquito control or salt marsh haying (Griswold et al., 1975). identified an erosional contact ~75cm deep, which dated from 1640-1670 C.E. This erosional contact was marked by a single layer of tidal mud (-10-15 cm thick) at its base, topped by a low-marsh peat layer (-50 cm thick), and then a transition to high-marsh peat (Fig. 6.1). After a series of reconnaissance cores using a 1-m-long core auger and a 0.5-cm-long Russian corer, five locations along the transect were chosen for vibracores ( Fig. 6.1).

This event bed was substantially thicker than most other deposits (>2cm), and therefore was sampled at 1cm resolution to determine if a peak in coarse fraction aligns with a peak in Do.\nCores were split, photographed, and described in the lab. Distinctions between high and low marsh were determined through visual analysis of plant assemblages within the core (Niering & Warren, 2006;Richard A. Orson et al., 1987;Warren & Niering, 1993). To further test the hypothesis of van de Plassche et al. (2006), two cores were chosen for additional organic and coarse fraction analysis, one with the hiatus sequence (C15, -50m from the channel), and one with continuous deposition (C20; -15m from the channel). The amount of organic content throughout the cores can be used to further distinguish among high marsh, low marsh, and event layers, with lower organic percentages indicating more minerogenic input from tidal inundation (Donnelly & Bertness, 2001). Both cores were sampled at 1-cm resolution, after which samples were combusted at 550\u00b0C for 1.5 hours to determine organic loss on ignition (LOI; Dean, 1974) The remaining ash was then sieved at 63pm, the distinction between very fine sand and silt. Coarse fraction of each sample was determined by comparing the sieved weight of the sample to its original dry weight. Two different methods were used to determine ages of storm event deposits and the hiatus. Peaks in 1 3 7 Cs activity within the cores are the result of global fall-out from nuclear weapons testing, which began in 1954 and peaked at 1959 and 1963 C.E. (Dunphy & Dibb, 1994). The first 50 cm of both cores were sampled using a high-resolution Canberra gamma detector to determine 1 3 7 Cs activity. Thirteen radiocarbon dates were obtained from vegetation preserved within the cores. These dates were obtained using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon techniques at the National Ocean Sciences Accelerator Mass Spectrometer (NOSAMS) facility at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI). Age models and 95% uncertainties were developed using Bacon (Bayesian accumulation histories for deposits) software (Blaauw & Christen, 2011). Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH), a regional-scale surge model, was used to determine storm surge levels at the mouth of the Pattagansett River for several known historic storms (Jelesnianski et al., 1992), using the same storm tracks as those used in Boldt et al.

Averaging cumulative sediment flux spatially over all 52 storms, erosion is focused primarily along the ocean-side shorelines of the barrier islands, and sediment largely accumulated on the marshes, in the bays, and along the inlets (Fig. 1b). Using values for bed porosity consistent with Wiberg et al. (2015), net accumulation of sediment within the domain from the modeled storms ranged from 2.0 -5.3 mm/yr. Wind speed, wave height, and storm surge displayed statistically significant negative relationships with cumulative sediment flux ( Fig. 7.2; Table 7.S2). This suggests that there is increased sediment accumulation in the study region as each parameter increases in intensity. Cumulative sediment flux also displayed statistically significant negative relationships (net accumulation of sediment into the system) with the amount of time each parameter remained over the following thresholds: wave height > 2 m at Station 44096 or 44014 (dependent on data availability; Fig. 7.S2), wind speed > 10 m/s, and storm surge > 0.5 m. Relationships were determined using the product of the total time over the threshold and the magnitude of the corresponding variable for each storm. The product of magnitude (> 0.5m) and duration of storm surge alone explains most of the variance in cumulative sediment flux (Fig. 7.3; Table 7.S2). A multiple regression analysis of the three variables indicates that, similarly, the storm surge threshold-time product contributes the most to the relationship (p<0.001, R 2 =0.66). As a result, the influence of storm surge, particularly its duration and magnitude, appears to control the sediment budget of the bays. While the total cumulative flux indicates that more intense storms tend to result in net import of sediment to the study area, this result varies by sediment type. For all three study parameters, mud and very fine sand (20 m and 63 m, respectively) display the same significant negative relationship with cumulative flux, where increased storm intensity results in increased import of sediment to the back-barrier basin ( Fig. 7.4; Table 7.S3). Fine sand (125ym), however, tends to be exported from the tidal basin. Almost all storms (96%) exhibit net export of fine sand, regardless of intensity. The spatial variation in percent changes in bottom sediment grain-size distributions provides insight into storm-induced sediment dynamics (Fig. 7.1). Following a storm, back-barrier marshes accumulate medium-grained silt, herein defined as mud (20 m), from the ocean side of the inlets.

An updated event chronology and frequency analysis was also developed for SAP2, the core analyzed in Donnelly et al. (2015). From these event frequencies, a series of individual active intervals were determined for each core, when event frequency is greater than 1.2 events per century ( Fig. 3.4; Table 3.3).

These fifteen events were chosen as representative samples because they were easily identifiable and covered portions of both active intervals identified by Donnelly et al. (2015). Grain size was analyzed for particles > 32ptm, with focus on three levels: Dio, D 5 o, and D 9 o (Table 3.4). D 1 , the size for which 10% of the particles in the size distribution are smaller, was set through experimental design at >32 m by removing fines through sieving. Values for D 5 0 , the median grain size, and D 9 o were not adjusted for the removal of the finegrained ash. Since only 26% of the total variance in Do is explained by the coarse (>32 m) fraction of the sample (Fig. 3.6D, R 2 =0.26), the unadjusted D 9 value will give a more accurate estimate of the intensity of a given storm event than the coarse (232 m) fraction. D 9 0 values for SAP1, the core closest to the barrier, averaged 546 jm, with a range from 220 m to 919 m for the 15 events sampled ( Fig. 3.6A). D 9 values for SAP8 averaged 460 m, with a range from 182 m to 729 m for the 15 events sampled (Fig. 3.6B). D 9 0 values for SAP9, the core farthest from the barrier, averaged 577 im, with a range from 375 m to 894 m for the 15 events sampled (Fig. 3.6C). The variability in Do among different runs of the same sample was also considered. SAP8 had the least variability between individual runs (average standard deviation 71 m), whereas SAP9 had the most (average standard deviation 121 im).\nGrain size was analyzed across the entire spectrum, with focus on three levels: Dio, D 5 0 , and D 9 . Dio, the size for which 10% of the particles in the size distribution are smaller, was set through experimental design at >32 m by removing fines through sieving. Values for D3 0 , the median grain size, and D 9 0 were not adjusted for the removal of the fine-grained ash. Since only 11% of the variance in D 9 o is explained by the coarse (>32 im) fraction of the sample (Fig. 4.4, top, R 2 =0.11, p<0.05), the unadjusted D 9 0 value will give a more accurate estimate of the intensity of a given storm event than the coarse ( 32 m) fraction alone.

Do values for Matt6, the core closest to the barrier, averaged 450 m, with a range from 175 im to 699 m for the 14 event samples (Fig. 4.5, top). Do values for Matt7a averaged 580 m, with a range from 193 m to 1601 m for the 30 event samples (Fig. 4.5, middle). Do values for Matt8, the core farthest from the barrier, averaged 514 im, with a range from 194 m to 832 m for the 20 event samples (Fig. 4.5, bottom). The variability in Do among different runs of the same sample was also considered. Matt6 had the least variability between individual runs (average standard deviation 140 im), whereas Matt7a had the most (average standard deviation 338 im).\nAs discussed in Chapter 3, fifteen events were identified across three different cores from Salt Pond and sampled and analyzed for grain-size trends both spatially and temporally. Events from the core furthest from the barrier (SAP9) had consistently larger minimum and maximum grain sizes, a deviation from expected settling rates. This suggests that events recorded in the core further from the barrier may be influenced by other variables (e.g. wave breaking and erosion on back side of pond during event) and, as such, are not appropriate for application of this inverse modeling technique. Due to its high standard deviation and poor sorting, we exclude SAP9 and focus our analysis to events in the remaining two cores, which are further away from the back end of the pond (SAP1 and SAP8). Of those 15 events, the Do values of 10 followed a landward-or marginally landward-fining trend. Five followed a landward-or marginally landward-coarsening trend (Fig 5.3a). Four historic events were identified in the cores (1991, 1938, 1675, and 1635per Donnelly et al., 2015). Two historic events followed a landward-fining trend, one followed a landward coarsening trend, and one followed a marginally landward-coarsening trend. Of the 11 prehistoric events (-1600-1400 CE and ~600-500 CE), eight events followed a landward-fining or marginally landward-fining trend, and three followed a landward-coarsening or marginally landward-coarsening trend. As seen in Chapter 4, twelve events identified across three different cores from Mattapoisett were sampled and analyzed for spatial and temporal grain-size trends. Events from the cores furthest from the barrier (MATT7 and MATT8) consistently overestimate wind speeds by at least an order of magnitude, suggesting that their position behind the tidal creek may influence their sedimentation. Due to the location of the cores furthest from the barrier, only events from the core closest to the barrier (MATT6) were considered for analysis. Of those 12 events, the Do values of six followed a landward-fining trend, five followed a landward-coarsening trend, and one event had similar grain sizes throughout the transect. Seven historic events were identified in the cores (1991, 1960, 1954, 1938, 1815, and 1635per Boldt et al., 2010), of which all but the 1635 event followed a landwardfining trend. The 1635 event did not follow either trend, and the remaining five historic events (~1600-800 CE) followed a landward-fining trend (Fig. 5.3b).  (Fig. 5.6a). This is consistent with observed wind speeds associated with major historic storms in the study location ( m/s) to category 3 storm (-52m/s) ( Fig. 5.6b). This is also consistent with observed wind speeds associated with major historic storms in the study location ( Fig. 5.6b, Table 5.2). Error was higher in this location, with an average standard deviation of 14.9 m/s. Standard-deviation values for landwardfining events ranged from tropical storm (-18 m/s) to a strong category 4 storm (-69 m/s)."}, {"section_title": "Trends in deposition", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Spatial trends in deposition", "text": "The three cores in the event bed grain-size analyses are along a transect, with SAP1 closest to the barrier and SAP9 farthest from the barrier.

Events with a ratio larger than one half standard deviation from the historic mean were considered relatively longer in duration (Fig 3.8A). Those events included the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635, as well as events 7, 11,12, 25, and 26. Analysis of event beds associated with the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635, a substantially thicker deposit than most other deposits (>2cm), revealed that peaks in coarse fraction do not always correspond with peaks in D 9 0 value ( Fig. 3.9). For SAP1, the peak in coarse fraction occurred at 55.5 cm depth, whereas the peak in D 9 0 value occurred at 53.5 cm.

Previous research into tropical cyclone event deposits has identified a fining-landward trend, consistent with an inundation/run-up overwash regime (Brandon et al., 2014;C. Donnelly et al., 2006;Woodruff, 2008). The fall velocity of a given grain determines the sorting trends seen in deposition. Fall velocity is dependent on several factors. Stokes' Law applies to small particles, where the settling is impeded by the drag associated with the laminar flow surrounding the grain (Ferguson & Church, 2004). Settling of small particles is slow, and fall velocity increases with the square of the diameter of the particle. Larger particles settle far more rapidly, since the drag associated with the wake behind each particle accelerates their settling. As such, their fall velocity increases with the square root of the diameter (Ferguson & Church, 2004). In both cases, larger particles have larger fall velocities and settle sooner, resulting in a landward-fining overwash deposit. This trend, however, is present in only 36% of the 22 events identified, suggesting a more complicated sediment transport and deposition relationship. Of particular interest is the difference between historic and prehistoric deposits. The first seven events identified in the study sediment cores are correlated to hurricanes dating from the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635 to present. Of those events, all seven follow a landward-fining trend, where, at the very least, the maximum grain size of the event bed closest to the barrier is larger than the maximum grain size of the event bed furthest from the barrier. The mean maximum grain size of the historic events is also significantly higher than the mean maximum grain size of the prehistoric events. The prehistoric events, however, display a landward-coarsening trend, which is seemingly at odds with our understanding of particle fall velocities. The simplest way to explain this difference between historic and prehistoric events is a migration of the barrier separating the marsh from the ocean. static. This suggests that deeper events may actually have been deposited further from the barrier than they would today. As such, it is not surprising that the mean maximum grain size for the historic events is significantly higher than the mean maximum grain size for the prehistoric events. The transition from landward-coarsening to landward-fining deposition occurs by 1750 C.E., when the town of Mattapoisett was settled. This suggests that anthropogenic changes in sediment supply and coastal stabilization may be influential. The transition also occurs not long after the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635, which devastated southeastem New England with category 3 winds (Jarvinen, 2006). It is possible that surge and winds associated with this massive storm substantially changed the geomorphic layout of the area.\n\n"}, {"section_title": "Updated Salt Pond chronology", "text": "From the identification of these events, it becomes clear that the last few centuries of the historic record indeed represents an interval more active than that proposed by Donnelly et al. (2015). The cores along the study transect are in the deepest part of the basin, whereas SAP2 is approximately 30 m east of the transect, in a slightly shallower location. SAP2 is also at least 60 m southeast of SAP8 and SAP9 but only 30 m southeast of SAP5. The difference in location may play a role in the different events recorded, further emphasizing the need for a broader, whole-site view for storm reconstruction. Several additional events, below the event threshold for the Donnelly et al. (2015) core, were identified and traced across several study cores. These events often had lower coarse-fraction values and were not associated with known historic tropical cyclones. As such, they are likely the result of a different source. Nor'easters and other winter storms typically cause storm surges on northeast-facing shorelines (Donnelly et al., 2001a), and they produce deposits on south-facing shores largely through wave-interaction within the basin-not surge overtopping a sandy barrier. In the case of a colder past climate, where Salt Pond would be frozen for much of the winter (as opposed to days to weeks in today's climate), it is possible that a thin layer of sediment could accumulate on top of the ice through aeolian transport of sand throughout the winter. As the pond warmed, the layer of sediment could settle to the bottom and be relatively indistinguishable from a short-term event. It is important to consider, however, that we do not have historical analogs for this kind of deposition in Salt Pond, and our limited historic record suggests that overwash from tropical cyclone surge is a more likely source of the sediment in the event deposits. Ultimately, the events identified by Donnelly et al. (2015) are consistently replicated across six cores at least 20m apart ( Fig. 3.2). This suggests that the storm signal at Salt Pond is robust across both large spatial and temporal scales, with only minor refinements to the prehistoric chronology, well within age uncertainty. The additional historic events identified in the study cores suggest that the historic period from 1850 C.E. to present is also an active interval. The additional events identified at the deepest points of study cores SAP5, SAP8, and SAP9 also warrant further investigation to properly constrain the deepest time recorded at this location."}, {"section_title": "Assessment of deposition trends", "text": "Previous research into tropical cyclone event deposits has identified a fming-landward trend, consistent with an inundation/run-up overwash regime (Brandon et al., 2014;C.

Within distributions of both small >32tm Surface waves caused by winds have been shown to be a player in increased bottom stress and resulting sediment resuspension (Booth et al., 2000;Carper & Bachmann, 1984;Luettich et al., 1990). Luettich et al. (1990) describe the influence of strong winds on surface waves in Lake Balaton, an inland lake in Hungary. The authors found that surface waves related to episodic wind events were the dominant cause of sediment resuspension in the system. Since Salt Pond is adjacent to a coastal barrier, surface-wave resuspension of sediment across the pond is likely not the most influential factor in storm deposits, but it may still play a role in explaining landward-coarsening events. Increased interaction of surface waves with the shallowing, far edge of the pond may result in increased sediment input from the pond edge and increased resuspension of deposited sediment during high-energy events. These interactions may have resulted in increased grain-size values for SAP9, the core farthest from the barrier in the transect. Though most storms to impact Salt Pond have large surge components, wave energy is required to transport sediment from the sandy barrier into the basin. As such, the same wind conditions that cause both surface and offshore waves are necessary for deposition of sediment and responsible for an element of resuspension. Inundation and overwash regimes in a back-barrier coastal pond setting generally assume that the majority of the sediment deposited during storm events is sourced directly from the adjacent barrier. A variable sediment source, however, also may explain landward-coarsening deposits. Rodriguez et al. (2013) found that aeolian sand contributed substantially to the sedimentation of the first 20m of back-barrier marsh. The authors suggest that aeolian transport may also be a potential mechanism for emplacement of sand beds. Since aeolian deposits are often finer than overwash deposits (Rodriguez et al., 2013), storms with longer-duration or stronger wind components may deposit fine grains closer to the barrier, causing a landward-coarsening trend. It is also important to consider that deposition at Salt Pond is subaqueous, so grains transported by aeolian means will also be subject to influences of settling and resuspension in the pond prior to their deposition. The lower maximum grain-size values in the oldest events analyzed (25 and 26; ~500-600 CE) may be due to migration of the barrier linked to sea-level rise. Nearby reconstructions indicate a linear increase in mean sea level of approximately 1.0\u00b10.2 mm/year from ~1300 C.E. to -1850 C.E., with that rate increasing almost more than twofold in the mid-19th century (Donnelly, 2004 (Bruun, 1988). Research indicates that barriers less than 200 m in width migrate landward primarily through overwash (Bruun, 1988 events, if sourced from barrier overwash, may actually have been deposited further from the barrier than they would be today."}, {"section_title": "Relationship between grain size and coarse fraction", "text": "The 1635 test case explored the relationship between coarse (>32 m) fraction and maximum grain size in a thick (>2 cm) event (Fig. 3.9 may beinfluenced by barrier migration, there is a substantial peak in coarse fraction for event 26 in SAP1.

In-depth grain-size and coarse-fraction analysis of 15 event beds in three study cores reveals the importance of expanding reconstructions beyond one study core. Grain-size analysis of the pond on a larger scale reveals significant variation both spatially and temporally, suggesting that event bed sediment sources are not uniform. Future sediment-based reconstructions must consider the impacts these differences in sediment source may have, including challenging the traditional assumptions that hurricane-induced event beds in these locations are largely directly from sandy-barrier overwash. Coarse-fraction values do not always align with grain-size values, emphasizing the importance of approaching event sedimentation from both angles, especially when events may vary significantly in duration. A broader, whole-site approach to tropical-cyclone reconstruction in coastal ponds will both bolster and illuminate trends in event deposition, which is imperative to painting more accurate portraits of past tropical cyclone activity.             to decrease as distance from the barrier increases, not all study events followed this trend within uncertainty. Analysis of the storm event beds revealed a significant difference between historic and prehistoric deposits, suggesting that complex sedimentation or geomorphic dynamics may be at play in this area. This in-depth, whole-site approach has implications for improving future storm reconstructions.\nMattapoisett Marsh presents a unique environment to study grain-size trends in hurricaneinduced storm deposits. Previous reconstructions of storm frequency have assumed relatively straight-forward overwash and deposition dynamics, but a deeper look into the intricacies of both spatial and temporal grain-size trends requires a more nuanced technique. While many reconstructions focus on one core from one location, a whole-site approach is necessary to properly constrain the sediment dynamics. While the incongruity between historic and prehistoric deposits may be unique to Mattapoisett Marsh, the breadth of variation in grain-size trends likely apply to back-barrier marshes throughout New England. Back-barrier marshes provide a valuable location for preserving storminduced overwash events, but the complexity of deposition dynamics must be considered in future reconstructions.   Figure 4.4 Top, the relationship between sample Doo and coarse (232 m) fraction suggests that the unadjusted Do value will give a more accurate estimate of the intensity of a given storm event than the coarse (>32 m) fraction alone (coarse fraction explains only 11% of the variance in Do, p<0.001).\nThe intensity from prehistoric deposits.

This has major implications for coastal inundation risk to lives and property, as well as the resilience of these coastal wetlands to a changing climate. This study investigates a stratigraphic sequence in a salt marsh in Niantic, CT, associated with an erosional unconformity and a 600-year sedimentary hiatus, followed by a period of recovery and a change in vegetation. van de Plassche et al. [Geology,34(10), 829-832 2006 \nOur study tested the hypothesis presented by van de Plassche et al. The widespread erosion at this site may mark a departure from our current understanding of salt marsh evolution, form, and function. This has significant implications for coastal communities and infrastructure relying on the surge-buffering properties of marshes. If a series of intense hurricanes is capable of degrading marshes to the point of massive erosion, then the increasing frequency of intense hurricanes in the coming century (Bhatia et al., 2018;Emanuel, 2013;Korty et al., 2017), augmented by sea-level rise (Woodruff et al., 2013), may pose an even greater threat. This also has implications for marshes that are already degraded, since New England salt marshes have continued to become increasingly vulnerable to both anthropogenic and climate impacts (Gedan et al., 2011). Future work should continue to better understand the erosional potential of New England salt marshes in the face of such increasing storminess.    Figure 6.7 Proposed mechanism for the sequence at Pattagansett. A) The originally proposed mechanism, where erosion from one storm creates accommodation space that is rapidly infilled by sandy mud and then recolonized by marsh (modified from Nikitina et al., 2014). B) A proposed mechanism where the root zone of the marsh is weakened by multiple storm events through deposition of sediment; a storm (or storms) can then erode a great deal of the marsh, after which it recovers. C) A proposed mechanism where ice rafting removes a portion of the marsh, then a highenergy storm leaves a sandy deposit, after which the marsh recovers. \nThis thesis characterizes the varied signatures of past tropical cyclones in coastal ponds and marshes along the eastern coast of the United States. This work deviates from traditional one-core, one-site analysis, instead exploring the benefits of a more expansive, process-based approach in both site selection and grain-size analysis. This extensive literature review of Chapter 2 reveals a high degree of spatial variability, both in terms of deposition and erosion, during both past and modem storm events. Our extensive analysis of storm events along the eastern coast of the United States confirms this finding. Given the spectrum of potential impacts of tropical cyclones on salt marshes (Chapters 2, 4, 5,6, and 7) and coastal ponds (Chapters 3 and 5), in-depth analysis of complex sedimentary signatures is necessary to build better paleo-reconstructions of storm frequency and intensity. This is of particular importance as the frequency of intense hurricanes, augmented by sea-level rise (Woodruff et al., 2013), is expected to increase in the coming century (Bhatia et al., 2018;Emanuel, 2013;Korty et al., 2017). that event deposits occur from relatively straight-forward overwash dynamics, but a deeper look into the true intricacies of these event trends requires a more nuanced, process-based technique. Where Chapters 3 and 4 focus on reconstructing storm frequency, Chapter 5 assesses the utility of inverse modeling to reconstruct storm intensity from the maximum grain size of a deposit. Here, we present an approach updated from that proposed by Woodruff et al. (2008), which uses synthetic storm results to generate location-specific storm wave characteristics. Though model results were consistent with historic values, error was sizeable due to the model's sensitivity to natural variations. As with the previous chapter, a whole-site approach, including in-depth analysis of sediment transport trends, aids in smart selection of cores and events for further intensity analysis. Though analysis of prehistoric storm intensity remains difficult to quantify (Chapter 5), Chapter 6 explores the potential for salt marshes to be eroded by one or a series of high-intensity storms. Through testing the van de Plassche et al. (2006) hypothesis that a -600-year hiatus in a Connecticut salt marsh was associated with erosion from the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635, we find that, though the hiatus and associated stratigraphic sequence are likely due to a high-energy event such as a hurricane, the intensity of the 1635 storm alone was not enough to cause such pervasive erosion. If the erosion is from degradation by storms over a longer time period, as posited, it suggests that periods of increased storm frequency of intense storms may have detrimental effects on the resilience of marshes. Again, this finding and subsequent interpretation was only possible through extensive analysis of a transect of several sediment cores throughout the marsh to determine how storm signatures vary across spatial and temporal scales. To geographically expand our analysis of storm impacts to an entire coastal system, we turn to the high-resolution, three-dimensional modeling in Chapter 7. Chapter 7 uses this modeling to determine the impacts of storms on the sediment budget of a system of coastal marshes and bays in Virginia. While the real storm data simulated in the system were largely marked by lower wind speeds (<24 m/s), model results show that intense storms import more sediment into the system than less intense storms. This suggests that the resilience of these systems may actually increase as storm intensity increases, but it remains to be seen if a certain threshold of intensity exists at which sediment erosion overpowers accumulation. Viewed as a whole, this thesis explores the sedimentary signatures of storm events along the eastern coast of the United States through a variety of methods. Deposition and erosion of sediment during a major storm remain both nuanced and complex, emphasizing the importance of contextualizing storm signatures within a broader, process-based view of the study area. Future work in this area should delve deeper into these processes and their impacts on sediment signatures with the aid of both expanded field campaigns and hydrodynamic modeling, with particular focus on the potential for these systems to be severely damaged by intense storms. Improving our understanding of these signatures and the processes behind them strengthens both paleo-reconstructions of storm activity and our ability to make informed decisions regarding coastal management in the face of future changes in storminess.

The eight cores represent two transectsbeach parallel and beach perpendicular. The cores (Mattl-Matt8) were composed primarily of organic-rich high-marsh peat, punctuated by coarser-grained, denser sand layers (Boldt et al., 2010). For each core, sand layers were identified using high-resolution (200 im) digital radiographs, where a sharp contrast in sediment density indicated the presence of a sand layer (Boldt et al., 2010). The thickness of each event layer was determined using the pixel count of the high-resolution radiographs. Previous research focused extensively on grain-size analysis of Matt2, a core in the beachperpendicular transect, taken 83 m from the beach. Peaks in Matt2 Do grain size were identified using a Beckman-Coulter LS13320 laser diffraction particle size analyzer, after combusting the organic material of each contiguous centimeter at 550\u00b0C for one hour (Boldt et al., 2010). Following the inferred correlation lines previously published by Boldt and colleagues (2010), 30 correlative events were identified in Matt7a, the longest core recovered at ~250cm of sediment, and 20 correlative events were identified in both Matt6 and Matt8 (Fig. 4.2). The chronology of these events was constrained in Matt2 and then inferred across cores using a variety of techniques, including C-14 radiocarbon dating and gamma analysis of cesium isotopes. These dates and their uncertainties were used in conjunction with a Bayesian age-depth modeling program (Bacon) to produce age models and associated 95% uncertainties (Blaauw & Christen, 2011), an update from the chronology presented by Boldt et al. (2010). The first seven identified storm events have been correlated with known historical storms, from 1991 (Hurricane Bob) to 1635 (The Great Colonial Hurricane) ( Fig. 4.3). In the current work, a new approach was used to determine the grain size distribution of other cores in the beach-perpendicular transect. Using the event correlations established by Boldt and colleagues (2010), identified storm events were sampled in three vibracores, Matt6, Matt7a, and Matt8 (50 m, 100 m, and 115 m from shore, respectively). The samples were combusted at 550\u00b0C for 1.5 hours to remove organic material and then sieved at 32 m to isolate grains coarse silt-sized and larger. Coarse fraction of each sample was determined by comparing the sieved weight of the sample to its original dry weight. This represents a departure from the 2010 procedure, where the samples were not sieved prior to grain size analysis-the sieving removes the fine-grained ash and the larger sample sizes provide more material for quantifying grain size distributions. Sieved samples were analyzed using a Horiba Camsizer digital image processing particle, size, and shape analyzer at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Since there is potential for variability in each run, each sample was run three times and averaged. Do, the size for which 90% of the particles in the size distribution are smaller, is used as a metric for the maximum grain size. For Matt8 and Matt7a, all correlative events were analyzed for particle size distribution. For Matt6, only events with a coarse fraction (32 rm) above a threshold value of 5% were analyzed. As discussed by Brandon et al. (2010), the unadjusted distribution (which does not consider the fine grains removed by the sieving process) is best suited for use in sediment transport calculations, since the unadjusted D 9 0 value is more representative of the largest grains transported during a major flood event. Following the advective-settling model described by Woodruff et al. (2008), storm deposits from tropical cyclones often exhibit landward-fining trends, such that coarser grains are found deposited closer to the barrier and finer grains are found further from the barrier. As waves overwash the barrier during large-scale inundation events, observational and experimental data (C. Donnelly et al., 2006) suggest that flow behind the barrier becomes supercritical-the flow velocity is larger than the wave velocity. During extreme inundation conditions, the sediment transport may also be dominated by suspended load (C. Donnelly et al., 2006). Given a sizable reduction in turbulence between the barrier and the area behind it, it is thought that settling of the sediment plays a larger role in the ultimate transport of the sediment grains than turbulent resuspension (Woodruff et al., 2008). Larger particles in a fluid experience more drag, and, as a result, settle out of suspension faster. The maximum grain sizes in each event along the transect were analyzed to determine if they followed a landward-fining trend. To accomplish this, a simple regression analysis was performed for each event-a negative correlation among points indicated that the results followed the expected trend."}, {"section_title": "Applications and caveats of inverse modeling to reconstruct tropical cyclones", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Recent research has attempted to use grain-size distributions of overwash deposits and hurricaneinduced event beds to estimate the intensity of past tropical cyclones.

Only storms with a significant offshore wave height exceeding 3m for Salt Pond and 1m for Mattapoisett Marsh, respectively, at the peak wave period were considered. These threshold values were similar to offshore wave heights at the respective study areas during 1991's Hurricane Bob (Cheung et al., 2007). The average peak wave period and its standard deviation were used to produce a representative estimate of offshore wavelength for large storm events, which was then combined with maximum wave-induced run-up over the barrier, and then combined in equation 3to obtain a value for significant offshore wave height, Ho. Wind speed (Ui), was determined based on its relationship with offshore wave height at the study site using SWAN model results for a suite of more than 300 synthetic storms, identified as producing 0.5m of storm surge or more across New England. Similar to work by Ochi (2005), an empirical relationship between wind speed and SWAN-derived significant offshore wave height was determined for each site through linear regression (Fig. 5.4).

This improvement on the original technique has produced inverse-modeling results similar to historic observations/estimations, admittedly with large uncertainties (accounting for natural variation in the system, which contributes to uncertainties). Despite these uncertainties, mean wind speed values are remarkably similar to independently-obtained observations and numerical simulations of the same events. This suggests that the updated, site-specific model has tentative utility across a variety of different locations-from runup-dominated back barrier lagoons (Woodruff et al., 2008) to surgedominated coastal ponds and marshes (this study). Despite this, the model still represents an oversimplification of the sediment sources and transport regimes present in the study areas such that derived storm intensities should always be viewed as an approximation, and whenever possible should be complimented/supported with additional information (e.g. historical records, numerical simulations, hydrodynamic models). The addition of location-specific values in this technique does aid in returning reasonable estimates of storm wind intensities from known storms, but it does not account for differences in shore geometry, which may produce anomalously large storm surges from lower wind speeds. It also does not take wind direction into consideration-a storm blowing in an offshore wind direction at its peak wind speed will not leave the same deposit as a storm blowing directly onshore at its peak wind speed. This is a potential explanation for the discrepancies between model results and model output from SLOSH simulations in the same location (Fig. 5.7). Our study illuminates the importance of core location in reconstruction (Fig. 5.8). Though the Woodruff et al. (2008)  For Salt Pond, events from the core furthest from the barrier consistently deviated from expected settling rates, with larger minimum and maximum grain sizes than the two cores closer to the barrier. Given this discrepancy and the close proximity of the core to the far side of the pond (>100m), it is likely that deposition at this core location was influenced by sediment sourced from the pond edge and resuspension from waves propagating across the pond. Inverse modeling techniques for this location consistently overestimated wind speeds and, as such, this core location was not included in our analysis. At Mattapoisett Marsh, three cores were taken along a transect that intersected a 2-5m tidal channel. Modeling of samples from the two cores located behind the tidal channel also consistently overestimated wind speeds. The geomorphology of the marsh suggests that these two cores, located both further from the barrier and bordered on the south and west by an established tidal channel, may be influenced more by the channel than direct overwash and deposition from the barrier. In both cases, a critical look at the grain-size settling trends and geomorphology of the surrounding area were necessary to choose core locations appropriate for the inverse modeling procedure. Though our model of inundation and overwash regimes in these settings assumes that the majority of the sediment deposited during surge/runup events is sourced directly from the adjacent barrier, landward-coarsening deposits at both Salt Pond and Mattapoisett Marsh deviate from expected landward-fining sediment-transport trends. This suggests a change in sediment source, whether that be aeolian transport of sand during a storm (Rodriguez et al., 2013), sediment sourced from pond or channel edges, or turbulence and resuspension during deposition (Booth et al., 2000;Carper & Bachmann, 1984;Luettich et al., 1990). There are characteristics of sediment deposition in a salt marsh in particular that may not be accurately reflected in the original model. The model is based on settling velocity equations appropriate to deposition in a coastal pond or lagoon, where sediment transported over the barrier would be deposited into a body of water. From there, the sediment can settle to the bottom of the basin in accordance with standard grain-size settling velocity relationships (e.g. Ferguson and Church, 2004). The ability of salt marsh vegetation to trap sediment, however, is well-documented (Fagherazzi et al., 2012;Gleason et al., 1979). Overwash may cause sediment to be deposited directly onto the marsh surface, where friction and increased drag from the marsh vegetation may trap sediment earlier than anticipated by the model (Christiansen et al., 2000;Fagherazzi et al., 2012;Nepf, 2012;Yang et al., 2015). Given the surge-dominated environments of the study sites, it is also important to consider how a complete inundation of the barrier may influence sediment transport dynamics. Modeling of the effects of Hurricane Bob on southern New England suggests that Mattapoisett, along with other areas in Buzzards Bay, may have experienced an inundation regime during Hurricane Bob (Cheung et al., 2007), where the storm surge alone is greater than the height of the barrier (C. Donnelly et al., 2006). Modeled storm surge estimates for Mattapoisett during Hurricane Bob exceeded 2.5-3 m (Boldt et al., 2010;Cheung et al., 2007), which is above the Lidar-recorded barrier height of 1-2.5 m. Extreme inundation effectively negates the influence of the barrier, since a sheet of water and sediment can flow unimpeded over the barrier, depositing sediment through porosity and friction losses (C. Donnelly et al., 2006). The advective-settling model is built around the assumption that the majority of the sediment is transported during a wave-dominated regime and as such does not consider surgea major shortcoming for modeling intensity in these surge-dominated study locations. The model also does not take into consideration potential changes in the barrier over timewhether changes in width or distance from the core site. Barrier migration is controlled largely by two primary factors: sea level change and sediment budget (Curray, 1964), and overwash in particular contributes to migration by removing sediment at the front of the barrier and depositing it landward (C. Donnelly et al., 2006). Barrier transgression would typically result in an artificial increase in derived storm intensities over time, as the advective distance (equation 2) decreases. Migration is common in almost all barrier-dominated systems, increasingly complicating the interpretation of model results particularly for paleo-deposits where barrier morphology is not known. Many of the processes mentioned, if in play in these study sites, would produce lower-thanactual intensities from our updated inverse modeling technique. Resuspension, turbulence, and aeolian transport would likely result in lower mean D 9 0 values through introducing or reworking smaller grains into the deposits. Vegetation influence would result in larger grains deposited closer to the barrier, also producing smaller intensities when considered in our model. In all of these cases, event grain size characteristics are likely limited by the grain sizes available to transport, which may vary both seasonally and over time. As such, if no coarse sediment exists to transport or resuspend, then the inverse modeling technique will return anomalously low intensities. This has particularly interesting implications for use in risk assessments, since these estimates may in fact represent a lower bound of storm intensity in the area."}, {"section_title": "Event stratigraphy and chronology", "text": "The study transect revealed three distinct components of the marsh: visible historical sand layers within S. patens-rich high marsh at the top of the core, a section of S. alterflora-rich low marsh atop two distinct sandy mud layers in the middle, and transition from high marsh through low marsh to sandy tidal mud at the base (Fig. 6.2). These components are replicated throughout the four study cores furthest from the channel to the southeast. The core closest to the channel (C20) lacks the lowmarsh and mud sequence and instead has a series of four distinct sandy mud layers. The upper -20cm of the marsh contain a visible layer of sandy organic-rich peat (15-20 cm in depth in both C15 and C20). This layer corresponds to two peaks in coarse fraction in both C15 and C20 (Fig. 6.3). 1 3 7 Cs dating ( Fig. 6.3) and the Bacon age model ( The distinct sandy-mud layers in the middle of the marsh range from -70cm to -135cm in depth across all cores (Fig. 6.2).

We constrain the date of the erosional as the sandy-mud layers consistently date prior to 1200 C.E. The hiatus is, however, associated with a significant peak in coarse fraction in C15, thought to be a coarse-lag deposit from a high-energy event. During the -10cm recovery period in C15, there are no peaks in coarse fraction or anomaly other than the peak at -78cm. Given correlations in the age model, it is thought that the hiatus encompasses -600 years, during which at least nine separate hurricane-induced peaks in coarse fraction anomaly are found in the continuous core (Fig. 6.5)."}, {"section_title": "Attribution of event layers", "text": "Given their temporal proximity to many known storms and similarity to other deposits in the area (Boldt et al., 2010;Donnelly et al., 2001a), we suggest that the peaks in sand content throughout the core represent periods of overwash and flooding from the adjacent channel due to increased storm surge during a hurricane. The first peak in coarse fraction is at 5.5cm in C15, dated at 95% confidence as between 1967-2014 C.E., with a mean value of 1994 C.E. Because this peak is relatively small in coarse-fraction ( Fig. 6.3) but significant in its anomaly (Fig. 6.5), we attribute it to Hurricane Bob (1991). Hurricane Bob made landfall in 1991 as a category 2 storm -55km to the east in Rhode Island. SLOSH modeling of the storm indicates that Hurricane Bob generated the smallest surge of the modeled storms, with a surge of 1.4m at the mouth of the Pattagansett River, associated with a 2m difference between maximum and minimum surge ( Fig. 6.6). The two visible sand layers (between 15-20cm in C15 and C20) date with 95% confidence  Fig. 6.2). Several visible sandy-mud layers, consistent with hurricane deposits, exist throughout the marsh. van de Plassche et al. (2006) indicated only one of these visible layers in the stratigraphy (Fig. 6.2) and interpreted it as a gray, siliciclastic tidal deposit composed of silty clay. Our analysis reveals two distinct, gray, sandy-mud layers where van de Plassche et al. "}, {"section_title": "Mechanisms for erosion", "text": "Our tests of van de Plassche et al. (2006)'s marsh erosion hypothesis corroborate the theory that a high-energy event was the likely culprit of a ~600-year sedimentary hiatus. Given the site's propensity to record overwash events for major historic hurricanes, it is likely that similar peaks in coarse fraction are the result of hurricane activity. Therefore, we interpret the peak in coarse fraction at the base of the hiatus as a coarse-lag deposit from a high-energy erosional event. Since the coarselag deposit dates between the mid-sixteenth and mid-seventeenth centuries, it is possible that a storm or multiple storms during or prior to that time period caused the erosion. Given a similar radiocarbon date, van de Plassche et al. (2006) suggested that the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635-recorded as a deposit -60 km away in a salt marsh in Matunuck, Rhode Island (Donnelly et al., 2001a)-may have caused the widespread erosion seen in the marsh. SLOSH simulations (tracks from Boldt et al., 2010) of storm surge in the Pattagansett River, however, reveal that the maximum storm surge for the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635 was likely substantially lower than that of both the Great New England Hurricane (1938) and Hurricane Carol (1954), both of which leave an overwash deposit in the sedimentary record (Fig. 6.6). There was also no substantial difference in return surge between any of the modeled storms. Therefore, the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635 alone is unlikely to cause such expansive erosion (Fig. 6.7a). The erosional sequence encompasses ~600 years of activity, during which there were at least nine hurricane deposits in the continuous core ( Fig. 6.5). This time period corresponds to roughly ~1100 C.E. through ~1700 C.E., consistent with other local overwash fans in Rhode Island (Donnelly et al., 2001a) and Massachusetts (Chapters 3 and 4). If the erosion indeed was the result of multiple storms over a relatively short time period (>1 storm/century), it is possible that the additive impact of storm events was enough to weaken the marsh such that it became vulnerable to erosion. Consistent overwash deposits from storm surge and flooding of the Pattagansett River may have been enough to kill vegetation and start a positive feedback loop of destabilization (S. Temmerman et al., 2005). For example, a marsh system 12 km away in Lyme, CT, experienced so much overwash from the Great New England Hurricane in 1938 that the vegetation began to convert to \"brush and reeds\" (West, 2008). Howes et al. (2010) also documented that less-saline, S. patens-dominated marshes, like our study area, are more likely to have weak zones due to shallower root systems as compared to more saline, S. alterflora-dominated marshes. Temmerman et al. (2012) found that removal of tidal marsh vegetation increased platform flow velocities by a factor of 2 to 4. NOAA's National Storm Surge Hazard Maps indicate that the entire study area has the potential to be significantly inundated by at least two meters of water during a category 1 storm. For a category 3 storm, similar to that of the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635, the inundation could be greater than three meters (NOAA). Combining increased flow due to vegetation loss with significant storm surge may have created an ideal circumstance for erosion. Even without substantial vegetation death, a series of repetitive overwash deposits, regardless of thickness, may have been sufficient to weaken the root structure, leaving the area more susceptible to erosion from a storm that may have otherwise not been powerful enough to cause such destruction (Fig. 6.7b)."}, {"section_title": "Other potential mechanisms", "text": "It is important to consider other potential mechanisms for the sequences seen at Pattagansett River Marsh. van de Plassche et al. (2006) and Nikitina et al. (2014) explore different explanations for intertidal mud deposits overlying high marsh peat, including an increase in tidal range (Long et al., 2006), gradual migration of tidal channels (Stumpf, 1983), background rates of marsh-cliff retreat (McLoughlin et al., 2015), marsh pond formation (Wilson et al., 2009), and changes in sea level (Schwimmer & Pizzuto, 2000). Our in-depth analysis of the stratigraphy, coarse fraction, and chronology of this sequence reveals that the mud layers interpreted by van de Plassche et al. (2006) are in fact sandy storm event layers, deposited ~600 years prior to the erosional event. Gradual migration of tidal channels would result in a visible transition from high marsh to low marsh, but tidal creeks are generally stable over long timescales , and the process of migration is a slow, time-transgressive process. Since the sand at the base of the sequence is quartz- Another proposed mechanism is the influence of ice rafts during particularly cold winters. Argow et al. (2007) determined that ice rafts have the potential to transport sediment loads more than 100 m from the source and that 97% of ice rafts carry sizeable sediment loads. Wood et al. (2006) identified several marshes in Maine with sedimentation rates influenced by at least 20% ice-rafted sediment. Hardwick-Witman (1986) identified a series of ice-rafted peat blocks throughout a New Hampshire salt marsh. While ice rafts presently tend to form further north in New England (Hardwick-Witman, 1986;Wood et al., 2006)  across the Northern Hemisphere. Ice rafting has the potential to erode large portions of the marsh or deposit loads of sandy mud from adjacent tidal channels. A sequence of erosion followed quickly by sand/mud deposition from another ice-rafting event or a high-energy event such as a hurricane has the potential to leave a similar signature (Fig. 6.7c). Higher-energy events, such as hurricanes, may also contribute to other proposed mechanisms, including rapid changes in tidal range, channel geometry, or cliff erosion. For example, the Great New England Hurricane of 1938 caused a portion of a barrier spit in front of the Barn Island Marsh system (Stonington, CT) to separate, causing a significant change in the geometry of Little Narragansett Bay while still leaving an event deposit in the marsh (Orson et al., 1998). Even if the coarse-lag deposit is a direct result of a rapid change in tidal range, channel geometry, or cliff erosion, it is likely (given the age range and our understanding of the marsh's history) that the cause of that rapid change is a major hurricane. It is important to consider why the Pattagansett River Marsh shows evidence of pervasive, hurricane-induced erosion when other local marshes do not (e.g. Donnelly, Smth Bryant, et al., 2001;Donnelly, 2004;Miller et al., 2009). This may be due to a variety of factors, including marsh geomorphology, marsh composition, storm track, and storm intensity. Additionally, the erosional sequence in the study marsh is relatively visually subtle at first glance, and the presence of the ~600year hiatus is confirmed only through extensive radiocarbon dating throughout the core. It is possible that similar sequences could exist unrecognized in other marshes. It is clear through our study that a single marsh can experience both depositional and erosional events. These erosional events, however, are likely due to a confluence of ideal factors as discussed above."}, {"section_title": "MASSACHUSETTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "2 Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Model design", "text": "Hydrodynamic and sediment-transport simulations were conducted using the high-resolution, fluid dynamics model Delft3D-FLOW (Lesser et al., 2004) and the Delft3D-WAVE module, which is based on the SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore) wind wave generation and propagation model (Booij et al., 1999). This coupled system is suitable for simulating non-steady flows, wave generation and propagation, sediment transport phenomena, and related morphological developments in shallow seas, coastal areas, estuaries, lagoons, rivers and lakes. The model used a nested grid system to simulate wave generation and propagation. The outer grid-a curvilinear, coarse-grid wave domain with cell sizes that decrease as depth decreases-extends up to the location of NOAA buoy 44014 or, if no data from 44014 is available, up to the location of NOAA buoy 44099 (Fig. 7.S2). The inner grid-a nested quadrangular grid-covers the area of the bays with a 250 m constant resolution over the whole domain (Fig. 7.S2). Details on the bathymetry and friction coefficients used for the inner grid can be found in Wiberg et al. (2015). Water levels at the southern, northern and seaward open boundaries of the second grid were set equal to the water level measured at NOAA station 8631044 (Wachapreague, VA), with a phase shift and an amplitude correction to account for tidal propagation and dissipation in the domain (Fig.   7.S3). Wind speeds were simulated in both grids, with the outer grid using data from the offshore buoys (44014 or 44099) and the inner grid using data from Wachapreague.

Wind direction was highly variable throughout each simulated storm and, as such, was not found to significantly influence sediment flux and was not included in the analysis."}, {"section_title": "Discussion and Conclusions", "text": "Storm surge duration and magnitude have the most significant influence on cumulative storm sediment flux. The energy associated with a storm surge provides the shear stresses necessary for remobilization of sediment near the inlets and transport into the bay system. Storm surges have long been known to deposit sediment in marshes and bays during large storm events, on both historic and prehistoric timescales (Boldt et al., 2010;Donnelly et al., 2001a;Hodge & Williams, 2016;Smith et al., 2015;Tweel & Turner, 2012). Here, we show that these storms transport mud and fine-grained sediment through the inlets and deposit them onto tidal flats and marshes proximal to the inlets (Fig. 7.1F-H). Tidal inlets serve as the conduit for funneling sediment from offshore to the bay. Storm-driven sediment transported through the inlets is then available for further remobilization by waves and tides, feeding additional interior flats and salt marshes (Wells, 1995). Without a net input of sediment through the inlets, in the absence of riverine inputs, the system would drown in place, unable to counteract sea-level rise in the long run. Our study suggests that a storm surge threshold of 0.5 m or greater is sufficient to cause a net import of mud to the back-barrier system, regardless of the amount of time that the surge is above that threshold, assuming a continued supply of fine-grained material. Furthermore, the fine-grained sediment accumulation rates in the tidal bay system of 2.0 -5.3 mm/yr have the potential to exceed the current sea-level rise rates of approximately 4 mm/yr (Wiberg et al., 2015). Indeed, recent work documenting marsh accumulation rates has suggested that marshes in the VCR may be accreting at rates great enough to avoid the threat of drowning from accelerated sea-level rise (Kirwan et al., 2016; Walters & Kirwan, 2016). Other studies have supported sedimentation rates for large hurricanes ranging from 3-10 cm per storm event as sufficient for increased marsh production and growth (Baustian & Mendelssohn, 2015;McKee & Cherry, 2009). Since sea-level rise rates in the VCR are relatively high and likely increasing Sallenger et al., 2012), the resilience of these back-barrier tidal basins has significant implications for coastal bays worldwide, many of which have lower sea-level rise rates. The sediment budget of a given system is often considered a metric of coastal stability . Ganju et al. (2013) suggested that marsh systems with net export of sediment may be more unstable than marsh systems with net import of sediment. Though marsh stability can be influenced by a variety of factors, including net elevation change and suspended sediment source (Ganju et al., 2015), a marsh system's sediment budget has utility in predicting how the marsh will respond to rising sea levels over time, among other stressors. Our results suggest that storm events transport more sediment into tidal bays as they increase in intensity, thereby increasing their resilience in time. Our results may also have implications for the fate of marshes globally. Lacking major rivers or other volumetrically important inputs of freshwater (Stanhope et al., 2009) or sediment (Morton & Donaldson, 1973) to the coastal bays, the major driver of sediment input to back-barrier marsh systems is likely storms. Marsh systems that have more sediment input from riverine sources may have an even greater long-term adaptability to sea-level rise, which additional sediment input from storms will continue to augment. Indeed, meta-analysis of vertical accretion in salt marshes in both North America and Europe has shown that the majority of the 179 studied marshes have been accreting (Kirwan et al., 2016). Accumulation of sediment in tidal bay systems from storms, particularly intense storms, has been documented with Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Andrew in Louisiana (List et al., 2001;Morton & Barras, 2011), though documented impacts from storms are varied (Barras, 2007;List et al., 2001;Morton & Barras, 2011), and sediment budgets may vary between different tidal basins with different morphological characteristics (Pedersen & Bartholdy, 2006). Though some studies have suggested that erosion along the ocean-side of barrier islands will increase as sea levels increase (Rusty A. Feagin et al., 2005;Leatherman et al., 2000), our study shows that input from storms alone may enable marsh accretion to keep pace with or counteract relatively high current rates of sea-level rise (as previously suggested by Schuerch et al., 2013), provided the barrier islands remain relatively stable. As such, continued or increased storm activity may have positive implications for the resilience of marshes worldwide. This is particularly important as future projections indicate that rates of sea-level rise will only continue to increase (Parris et al., 2012). Many assessments agree that an increase in sea surface temperatures should result in an increase in the intensity of tropical cyclones (Holland & Webster, 2007;Sobel et al., 2016;Walsh et al., 2016), even with natural variability and confounding factors (Sobel et al., 2016). Our study identifies the mechanism by which increased storminess increases the resilience of coastal bays. In particular, storms provide the material necessary to counteract rising sea levels as storms entrain finegrained material from the nearshore and transport the material into back-barrier tidal basins through the tidal inlets. These findings are particularly of interest for coastal protection schemes, since salt marshes and shallow tidal flats present a unique natural way to protect vulnerable communities from the effects of storm surge and flooding by dissipating energy, the effects of which will only increase as storminess increases. Sea level is rising in the VCR at fast rates , and, as such, our study provides a potential upper-bound example of the resilience of coastal bay systems in the face of increasing storminess. Increased storminess, therefore, may increase the long-term viability of marshes and coastal bays worldwide.     and (c) 125tm fine sand (R 2 =0.57;p<0.001). There is a significant negative relationship between total cumulative flux and intensity of storm surge for mud (20 im) and very fine sand (63 m), indicating net accumulation. Though there is a negative relationship between total cumulative flux and storm surge for coarse sand (125 im), total cumulative flux is predominantly greater than zero, indicating net erosion for most study storms.

Storm events to be simulated on the model domain were determined using a peaks-over-threshold analysis (Fig. S; Table S1). The model domain consisted of a nested grid system, allowing the use of offshore, deep-water wave and water level measurements for our analysis (Fig. S2). The water level signal was adjusted, finding good agreement in both measured and modeled tidal amplitude and phase (Fig. S3). The model was then calibrated using a March 2014 storm (Fig. S4). Measured and modeled suspended sediment concentration for a three-week span in January 2004 showed good agreement, validating the model. Relationships between sediment budget (kg) and storm meteorology (wave height, wind speed, storm surge, and the time over a given threshold with each) are all statistically significant (p<0.001), with values associated with storm surge explaining the most of the variance (Table S2). Sediment budget as a function of grain-size distribution was positively related to storm surge values for all three grain sizes (p<0.001; Table S3).     and measured (black line) water levels at NOAA station 8631044 (Wachapreague, VA) during storm number 40 (see Table Si). Model performance was evaluated by adjusting the water level forcing (both phase and amplitude) at the southern, northern and seaward open boundaries in order to obtain the measured water levels at NOAA station 8631044 (Wachapreague, VA). Since the model forces offshore, deep-water wave data through a shallow-water system, it is necessary to adjust the offshore water level signal. A good agreement both in tidal amplitude and tidal phase was obtained (ME = 0.9814, RMSE = 0.0624 m, R = 0.9943, S = 0.9898) when imposing a water level signal delayed 54 mn and dampened by a factor of 88%.
