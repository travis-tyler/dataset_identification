Beginning in 2009, TUDA samples included only those charter schools that each district included for the purpose of reporting Adequate Yearly Progress to the US Department of Education under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. This rule did not exist in 2007, so the TUDA sample that year included charters without this AYP distinction. The inclusion or exclusion of charter schools from the TUDA samples did not affect the significance of the change in reported scores between 2007 and 2009, with the exception of the District of Columbia.

Next, we compare the average score of each district to the national public school sample and the large city (LC) averages. We conducted pairwise comparisons to test whether district means were significantly different from the national and LC averages. As the number of comparisons that are conducted at the same significance level increases, it becomes more likely that at least one of the estimated differences will be significant merely by chance. To control for multiple comparisons, these analyses were conducted using the Benjamini-Hochberg (1995) false discovery rate (FDR) procedure. In addition, we compared the performance of each district against the other districts after adjusting for certain student background characteristics. These analyses address a particular concern raised by many stakeholders when comparisons are made among states or districts with differing student background characteristics. A natural question is whether the differences we observe would have been different if all the jurisdictions being compared had the same demographic profile in terms of relevant student background characteristics. Fortunately, we have statistical methods that allow us to make comparisons among states or districts by controlling for these characteristics. We conducted regression analyses to estimate the performance of a district had its demographic profile, in terms of the selected students background characteristics, been the same as the average profile of all 18 districts. These analyses put the districts on a more level playing field with regard to these characteristics. Based on a literature review, we identified the following NAEP background variables as most relevant: race/ethnicity; special education status; English language learner status; indicators of the socioeconomic status of students, i.e., eligibility for free-or reduced-price lunch under the National School Lunch Program; the highest level of education attained by either parent; and information on the availability of literacy materials and computers in the students' homes. 4 We identified other studies where similar or identical background variables were used to estimate adjusted means. For example, Braun, Jenkins and Grigg (2006a) examined the differences in mean NAEP reading and mathematics scores between public and private schools, adjusting for gender, race/ethnicity, disability status, and identification as an English language learner (ELL). Braun, Jenkins, and Grigg (2006b) compared charter schools to public schools using the same approach. Based on the same regression analyses discussed above, we also computed the expected performance of each district based on their profile in terms of the selected student background characteristics. Next, we compared each district's actual performance to the expected performance for that district. We call the difference between the two the \"district effect.\" 5 Positive effects indicate that the district is performing higher than expected statistically and negative effects indicate that the district is performing lower than expected statistically. Note that there are limitations to these analyses. The adjusted performance and expected performance are both estimated based on variables that may affect student achievement and are beyond the control of the educators and policy-makers. It is obvious that we do not, and cannot, control for all such variables. There may be other variables that are related to achievement that we are not controlling for. Some of these variables are not measured in NAEP, and possibly some are not measurable in the first place. District effect is a product of our best attempt to estimate if a given district is performing any different from expected levels given their student profile on a limited number of variables measured in NAEP. In addition to comparing each district's average scale scores to other districts and the national public sample and LC averages, we also looked at the relative performance of each district across subscales. The 2009 reading assessment included two subscales: reading for a literary experience and reading for information. 6 The mathematics assessment for the same year included the following subscales: number properties and operations, measurement, geometry, data analysis and probability, and algebra. 7 Note that the NAEP subscales are not all reported on the same metric; hence, the subscale means are not directly comparable.

For grade 4 and 8 mathematics assessments we computed average percent correct and average omission-rates by subscale, item type, and mathematical complexity 8 (low, moderate, and high). Next, in order to identify items that are differentially more difficult for each district, we computed the standardized p-values (in z-score format) for the national public sample and the 18 districts. An item with a standardized p-value of 0 is an item of average difficulty for the given sample. Items with standardized p-values greater than zero are relatively easier for that sample and, conversely, items with standardized p-values less than zero are relatively more difficult for that sample. Next, we computed the difference between the standardized p-values for the national public sample and each district.

Eleven of these districts had also participated in 2007 assessments. We analyzed the performance of all 18 districts in 2009 and also examined the changes in performance for the 11 districts from 2007 to 2009. It is evident that the academic performance of public school students in many of the urban districts we examined this report is nowhere near what we would like it to be. However, the story is not uniform across all districts. There are districts that perform similar to, and, in some cases, even higher than the national average. Charlotte, Boston, and Austin are three examples. We also see districts that are performing below the large city and the national averages, yet are making significant progress. An example is the District of Columbia where significant gains were observed in reading and mathematics at both grades. On the other hand, some districts have a longer path to travel in order to achieve their targets. For example, among the 11 districts that participated in the 2007 and 2009 NAEP assessments, Cleveland and Chicago were the only two districts that performed lower than the national and the large city averages and showed no gains from 2007 to 2009. Policy makers, researchers and practitioners will be carefully watching the future performance of the nine TUDA districts that participated in NAEP for the first time in 2009. Despite their starting points, will Baltimore City, Detroit, Fresno, Milwaukee, and Philadelphia show progress in future assessments? Will Jefferson County perform as well in mathematics as it does in reading? Knowing where one is and knowing where one is headed are the first steps in making better decisions about reaching future targets. Like several other studies that use NAEP data, this study illustrates the depth and wealth of information available about academic performance of public school students in urban districts in the United States. Policy makers and practitioners can use this information. The variation in the demographic profiles of the 18 urban districts examined in this report makes the case that there is much these districts can learn from each other."}, {"section_title": "APPENDIX A (CONTINUED)", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Estimating adjusted mean scores", "text": "The method used in calculating the adjusted district means is discussed below.
