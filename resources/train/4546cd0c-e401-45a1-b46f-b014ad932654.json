In patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the neuronal and axonal degeneration results in increased release of tau from the microtubules. Furthermore, in pathological conditions such as AD, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or other tauopathies, tau is truncated and/or phosphorylated [3, 4] . Phosphorylated forms of tau (P-tau) aggregate in neurofibrillary tangles, contributing to cognitive impairment [5, 6] . Elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau and P-tau are established biomarkers for AD [7] . Plasma has been proposed as an ideal biofluid for biomarker analysis, as it allows collection of samples with minimal burden to the patients and facilitates longitudinal study designs [8] . However, until recently, AD biomarker measures were restricted to the CSF. Recently, novel technologies, such as single-molecule array (SIMOA), have enabled the detection of tau at very low concentrations (picomolar) in the blood [9] . Although plasma and CSF tau are not biomarkers specific for AD as CSF P-tau and blood tau has the potential to derive from other sources in addition to neuronal tau [10, 11] , work with ultrasensitive detection equipment suggests the potential for plasma tau to serve as a biomarker for neurodegeneration in AD as well as other neurological disorders associated with brain trauma and tauopathies [9, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Using the SIMOA technology, several studies showed higher plasma tau levels in patients with neurological disorders compared to cognitively normal (NL) controls [9, 15, 17, 18] . These results were promising, although they typically showed a relatively high degree of overlap in plasma tau concentrations between AD and controls and weak correlations of plasma tau with CSF total tau and P-tau levels in AD [19] . Little information is currently available on the value of adding plasma tau to CSF tau and CSF P-tau in AD biomarker panels in AD clinical studies. Here, to explore the diagnostic value of plasma tau and its usefulness in comparison to or in combination with CSF tau and P-tau, we measured plasma and CSF tau in 97 subjects including patients with AD and nondemented controls recruited at the Center for Brain Health of NYU Langone Medical Center. Moreover, we validated the agreement of the different assays by comparing CSF samples run with SIMOA and gold-standard ELISA assays and we examined the relationships of plasma tau with cognitive and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "All subjects were recruited at the Center for Brain Health of NYU School of Medicine (NYUSOM) and provided written, informed consent to protocols approved by the NYU-SOM Institutional Review Board (IRB) to participate in our National Institute of Health (NIH)-supported biofluids and imaging studies of aging and AD.

Diagnosis of normal or AD was made in accord with standard criteria [23, 24] by an experienced clinician based on progressive memory and cognitive complaints corroborated by an informant, clinically observed cognitive impairment as previously described [25] , and MRI to rule out other causes of impairment.

We are therefore 95% confident that the model including both CSF and plasma tau yields a greater AUC than the AUC of either biomarker alone (Fig. 4C, D) ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Plasma tau has the potential to be among the first blood biomarkers for neurological disorders to be implemented in the clinical setting. The addition of plasma biomarkers such as tau or neurofilament light to current CSF assays for AD clinical trials [16, 34, 35] is currently under consideration. In this study, we first replicated previous findings showing that plasma tau levels are higher in patients with AD compared with noncognitively impaired controls [9, [15] [16] [17] . We found that plasma tau was able to discriminate NL controls and patients with AD in our cohort with a large effect size of 1.1. This significant difference remained after we corrected for plasma albumin, to rule out the possibility that patients with AD may have lower blood volumes. Plasma tau alone classified NL controls and patients with AD with a similar accuracy when compared with the current goldstandard CSF total tau or CSF P-tau assays. Second, we corroborate that plasma tau seems independent of CSF tau measures, as no significant correlations were detected between plasma tau and CSF tau or P-tau [9, 17] . Third, we report the novel finding that adding plasma tau to CSF tau or CSF P-tau measures increases the accuracy or the differentiation of patients with AD versus NL controls in our cohort.\nA recent prospective study by Mattsson et al. using the ADNI cohort showed that plasma tau differentiated AD from controls, although there was a significant overlap between study groups [17] . Our results are in line with this work. Our study also confirmed a correlation between plasma tau and cognitive dysfunction, which Fig. 4 .

Abbreviations: AD, Alzheimer's disease; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; NL, cognitively normal; ROC, receiver operating characteristic; P-tau, phospho-tau.\nwas previously reported [15, 17] . In addition, we found a weak correlation of plasma tau with CSF tau and P-tau, which was lost when correcting for study groups. The loss of correlation between plasma and CSF tau values when correcting or separating by the study groups is also in line with previous findings [9, 17] , suggesting that the higher mean value of CSF tau and plasma tau in patients with AD compared with NL controls drives the correlation when both groups are included without correcting for diagnostic group. The lack of correlation in the split groups could be also due to fact that the smaller sample size lacks power to reach statistical significance. The weak correlation between plasma and CSF may also suggest potential differences in tau fragments in the CSF and plasma compartments and/or that these fragments would be differently recognized by the SIMOA (plasma) and INNOTEST (CSF) antibody combinations. However, in one of the first studies on plasma tau in AD, an INNOTEST-like antibody combination (Tau5 for capture [similar to AT120 in INNOTEST] and HT7 and BT2 [identical to INNOTEST]) was used on SIMOA [9] , suggesting that potential tau proteolysis or other forms of clearance in plasma, as well as noncentral nervous system sources of tau, would affect the two assay formats in a similar manner, which should be explored in more detail.\nIn this work, we show that the SIMOA and ELISA assays used perform with very high correlation in the same CSF samples, suggesting that the lack of correlation between plasma and CSF is driven mostly by the biological compartment. A higher metabolism of tau by plasma proteases could be one of the reasons of these differences. Owing to different catabolic cleavage, the tau fragments present in CSF and plasma will likely differ and smaller or different fragments in plasma may remain undetected by the same immunoassay that detects CSF fragments. The presence in blood of tau derived from other sources different from brain cells could also explain the lack of correlation with CSF [10, 11] . The expression of tau has been shown in platelets [10] , as well as in muscle, kidney, and other tissues (https://www. proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000186868-MAPT/tissue), expanding the pool of plasma tau to additional sources compared with those for CSF tau. Moreover, differential clearance pathways for interstitial fluid tau to the CSF or plasma could contribute to the lack of correlation [36] [37] [38] . For example, interstitial fluid tau may be internalized by glial cells or further catabolized before or after being released to plasma [39] . Also, smaller fragments of tau that are able to pass a dysfunctional blood brain barrier in AD may not remain in the CSF for a sufficient time to be detected, resulting in an increase in plasma tau fragments in patients with AD with a more damaged blood brain barrier. Different antibody specificity and assay performance in plasma versus CSF could also contribute to the weak correlation between the tau levels in the two compartments. Although this study cannot determine the causes of the weak correlation, these differences in assay results between CSF and plasma could contribute to the better discrimination of patients with AD and NL controls that we achieve adding plasma tau to CSF tau measures.\nOwing to the overlap between study groups (AD vs. NL) and to the lack of a strong correlation with CSF tau discussed previously, the validity of plasma tau alone as a biomarker for AD has been debated [17, 19] . However, recent studies found that, in regression models adjusted for age, gender, education, and APOE, higher plasma tau was associated with worse memory performance and abnormal cortical thickness in an AD signature region, highlighting the potential of plasma tau as a valid neurodegeneration biomarker in AD [15] . Moreover, higher levels of plasma tau, examined as a continuous variable, were associated with significant declines in global cognition, memory, attention, and visuospatial ability over a median follow-up of 3.0 years and with greater decline in both visuospatial ability and global cognition at 15 months in mild cognitive impairment patients [16] . Plasma tau was also negatively correlated with gray matter density in the medial temporal lobe, precuneus, thalamus, and striatum [14] . We are aware that elevated tau alone, both in plasma and CSF, cannot be considered a specific biomarker for AD. Elevated tau levels have also been related to traumatic brain injury and postconcussive cognitive symptoms in both acute [19, 40] and chronic traumatic brain injury [41] and to the effect of anesthesia and surgery [42] . This body of work highlights the potential validity of plasma tau as a measure of neurodegeneration, in agreement with our current data, which demonstrate a negative correlation between plasma tau and cognitive function (PARD).\nOur study reports the interesting and novel finding that, when combining plasma tau with CSF total tau or CSF Ptau, the accuracy for the differentiation of AD versus NL increases, suggesting that plasma tau may be a useful biomarker to add to CSF tau, and to the AD-specific CSF P-tau, in AD panels to increase diagnostic power and determinations of therapeutic efficacy. Plasma tau may also be useful in addition to other blood biomarkers of neurodegeneration such as neurofilament light [35, 43] , to better determine cognitive improvements in clinical trials. The possibility of adding measures of plasma or serum P-tau would also be an important future development for the field. Multiple assays are under development with Simoa, MSD [18] , and other platforms [44] to achieve this scope, although not yet commercially available.\nFuture clinical studies should focus on confirming if combining plasma and CSF tau determinations is feasible and beneficial in terms of costs versus gain.\nOverall, this study adds to the current literature in suggesting that plasma tau could represent a valuable biomarker to include in panels for AD clinical studies in addition to CSF biomarkers. More research is needed to better understand the molecular pathways responsible for the accumulation, clearance, and catabolism of tau in plasma and CSF, the relationship between plasma and CSF tau measures, and their association with cognitive dysfunction and blood brain barrier permeability measures.\nThe main limitations of our study are a lower number of subjects in the AD cohort compared with NL controls, the lack of a mild cognitive impairment cohort, and the fact that the diagnosis of AD is done by clinical evaluation and MRI without positron emission tomography or CSF biomarker confirmation.\nFuture studies are encouraged to replicate the results from this report using larger sample sizes and including mild cognitive impairment or preclinical AD cases, as well as in longitudinal studies or clinical trials."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "We report that plasma tau discriminates NL controls from patients with AD with similar AUCs compared with CSF tau and P-tau and is associated with cognitive measures.

Importantly, we detect an increase in the ability to discriminate patients with AD and NL controls when adding plasma tau to either CSF tau or CSF P-tau measures, suggesting that including plasma tau determinations in addition to CSF tau in AD studies could improve accuracy of diagnosis and detection of therapeutic effects in clinical trials."}]
