[{"section_title": "I. INTRODUCTION", "text": "The human cerebrum is a topologically complex organ with deep fissures and sulci over its lateral and medial surfaces, as well as fluid filled ventricles of complex shape and form in its interior. The creation of a physical model capable of depicting the form of the cerebrum is not trivial due in part to these deep structures. Previous works in creating brain phantoms have either reduced the depth of the sulci, 2 or only recreated the form of the brain superficially with dessert gelatin molds. 3, 4 Although these phantoms bear a cursory resemblance to the human cerebrum, they do not accurately depict the gross anatomy of the brain. Registering these phantoms to their acquired multimodality images may also not be straightforward since the landmarks on the phantom are not easy to find or image. This may be due to the structures being smaller than the imaging resolution or because of insufficient contrast of the markers with respect to its surroundings. For instance, Reinertsen and Collins 4 relied on the presence of bubbles in their phantom to act as landmarks for validation of their phantom. While trapped bubbles can be useful as landmarks in phantom validation, their locations cannot be controlled. Even when the bubbles are present, they may also be difficult to identify uniquely. To address these issues, multimodal landmarks need to be placed in the phantom.\nThe objective of this study is to create a triple modality human brain phantom with anatomically realistic structures and mechanical properties such as firmness, stiffness, and elasticity approaching that of a live human brain. Henceforth, we will collectively refer to these properties as \"texture.\" The material selected for constructing this phantom is polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), which is a polymer synthesized from polyvinyl acetate by hydrolysis of their acetate groups. 2 PVA is commonly used in industrial products such as adhesives, strengtheners for fiber products, thickeners for paints and other liquids, as well as in for the creation of films, emulsions, and coatings for various engineering purposes. 4, 5 When liquid PVA solutions undergo a specified period of freezing at a set temperature and are then allowed to thaw slowly to room temperature, this freeze-thaw cycle (FTC) transforms the liquid PVA solution into a elastic semi-opaque gel know as polyvinyl alcohol cryogel (PVA-C). [6] [7] [8] [9] In previous studies, soft tissue phantoms made from PVA-C have been used to develop, characterize, and refine different imaging or image processing methods. [10] [11] [12] PVA-C is a good material for such studies since it has similar texture, mechanical properties such as compressibility and elasticity, and similar water content to many soft tissues. 2, 4, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] PVA-C has many other desirable characteristics for building phantoms. For example, its tensile strength allows it to be stretched 5-6 times its original dimensions without tearing or rupturing, while its high degree of elasticity lets it return to its original shape with little permanent deformation. 8, 14 With cold storage and the addition of biocides, PVA is also relatively tough and long-lasting when compared with other similar textured materials such as gelatin or agar. 13, 14 PVA-C is also safe for normal handling in that it is biocompatible and nontoxic. 13 Finally, the gelling and setting of PVA into PVA-C is relatively uninvolved, requiring only the freezing and thawing of the molded PVA solution.\nFor these reasons, PVA-C has been used in the construction of soft tissue phantoms and to study a wide variety of tissues including those of the heart, 15,16 breast, 11, 12, 17 prostate, 14 arterial vasculature, 2,9,18 and brain, 2, 4 in addition to lesions and tumors within these tissues. 11, 12, 14 In the following sections, we describe the methods we used to create our brain phantom. We seek to contribute to the literature a phantom that has:\nAnatomical accuracy: Deep cortical structures of the Colin27 cerebrum, such as the sulci, the insular region and the ventricles are realistically represented in the cast phantom.\nRealistic texture: Recipes of PVA-C with textures approaching that of live human cerebral tissues were determined through the feedback of a neurosurgeon who knows the texture of the human brain and tumor tissues.\nMultimodal imaging: A single phantom that can be imaged effectively in computed tomography (CT), ultrasound (US), and magnetic resonance (MR) modalities with good contrast between phantom and water as well as between the phantom and its implants.\nFreely available data: Images acquired using the US, MR, and CT scanners are made available through our website to researchers and the general public. Images for this phantom were acquired using magnetic resonance imaging [T1 and T2 weighted, proton density (PD), fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)], ultrasound imaging, and computed tomography, to ensure that the phantom exhibits similar contrast to images of the live cerebrum acquired using these imaging modalities.\nWe also embedded inflatable catheters in the manner of Reinertsen et al. 3 to simulate deformation from brain-shift, which is caused by the nonlinear distortion of brain tissue due to gravity and brain swelling from various physiological factors.\nPotentially any PVA-C formula can be used to cast the brain phantom provided that it can be easily removed from the mold and that it holds its form once unmolded. However, we have noticed in past experiments that attaining the right phantom texture is important in getting realistic deformation through catheter inflation. As such, we believe that a PVA-C formulation that approximates live brain texture is desirable for the construction of our anatomically accurate phantom in order to validate nonlinear image registration algorithms and other image processing methods. Furthermore, the PVA-C formulation must be able to suspend the contrast agents used in the phantom (i.e., without settling out) during the casting of the phantom.\nAs such, although an imaging phantom will not necessarily need to have both anatomical accuracy and a realistic texture, in this work, we strove to incorporate both of these requirements into our phantom.\nIn Material and Methods, we describe the methods for preparing the PVA-C material, the added contrast agents, the creation of the phantom mold, and our multimodal image acquisition of the phantom. We conclude the paper with a listing of our Results followed by a Discussion of the work."}, {"section_title": "II. MATERIAL AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "II.A. Preparing PVA-C", "text": "The PVA solutions used to cast the PVA-C brain phantom and its various components were prepared using 99%-100% hydrolyzed PVA with an average molecular weight of 86 kDa from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium; Code:418120010).\nMaster PVA solutions were prepared in large quantities by combining heated distilled water of a certain mass with PVA solute of another mass. The final mass of PVA solute will make up a specific percentage of final solution's mass. This is known as mass percentage and is commonly abbreviated as w/w. In our experiments, master PVA solutions of 5 and 8% (w/w) were prepared.\nThe mixture was constantly stirred until the PVA particles are well hydrated upon which the holding vessel of PVA and water mixture was placed in an oven of 93-95 C for several hours. This ensures temperature homogeneity in the liquid and that the PVA granules dissolve properly. We were also careful to keep the temperature of the holding vessels below 100 C to minimize water loss and the formation of polymer films on the liquid surface. These parameters were taken from the solution preparation guidelines of Celvol PVA of a similar grade to what we were using. 5 The finished master solutions were checked visually to ensure that all PVA granules had been dissolved. Small quantities of distilled water were added back into the solutions according to the amounts lost during preparation of the PVA solution. From these PVA master solutions, base solutions of lower mass percentages could be produced by heating the master solution and mixing in additional water.\nPVA-C was polymerized from a PVA solution by completely freezing and thawing the solutions, which results into semitransparent flexible gel. The PVA solutions were placed in a room temperature (25 C) chest freezer and cooled to between \u00c025\nC and \u00c020 C. After 12 h of freezing at the aforementioned temperatures, the freezer was stopped and its interior was allowed to rise back to room temperature over another 12 h period. The cycles were varied from 1 to 3 FTCs to produce a range of different PVA-C texture consistencies."}, {"section_title": "II.B. Choosing a PVA-C Formula", "text": "In order to select a PVA-C formula (PVA solution concentration and FTC) that would provide a texture similar to that of a live human brain in our deformable brain phantom, we employed the subjective assessment of a neurosurgeon with 21 years of experience in vascular and skull base surgery, who was familiar with the texture of the human brain and its pathologies. The surgeon was asked to palpate an array of PVA-C samples that had been prepared with either 1, 2, or 3 FTCs and 4%, 5%, 6%, or 8% PVA solutions (12 PVA-C samples in total; see Fig. 1 ). During this exercise, the samples were palpated at room temperature by the neurosurgeon while gloved and blindfolded. The neurosurgeon was asked rate the similarity of each sample to human brain tissue on a scale of 0 (least similar) to 10 (most similar). The aforementioned procedure was then repeated to choose the samples which felt most like low grade gliomas.\nWe note that this strategy for selecting a PVA-C formula is subjective and cannot be used to draw conclusions about the quantitative rheological properties of live human brain tissue beyond the needs our tests. These properties should be measured and quantified using elastography or more directly through intraoperative mechanical tests. Along with additional information from the formal characterization of the rheological parameters of our PVA-C samples, we should be able to better select a PVA formula that is quantitatively similar to the mechanical properties of human brain."}, {"section_title": "II.C. Triple modality contrast agents", "text": "Commonly available chemicals were used to change the contrast between the phantom and water for all modalities (US, MR, and CT). A PVA-C with the PVA concentration and FTC resembling textures similar to a living human cerebrum was chosen to be the base solution for dissolving the contrast enhancing chemicals. We list all quantities of contrast medium added to the PVA solution as mass percentages (w/w) of the chosen PVA solution.\nTo increase backscattering of sound waves in US imaging, solutions containing talcum powder at 4%, 2%, 1%, and 0.5% weight of the base solution were mixed. Other materials such as thin-layer chromatography grade silica gel 14 and cellulose, 13 along with enamel paint 16 have also been used as acoustic backscatterers but we found that commercial grade talcum powder also performs well. Each of the samples were immersed in water, imaged, and then visually examined for contrast with the surrounding water and implanted PVA markers spheres.\nFor increasing phantom contrast in CT imaging, a powdered barium sulfate (BaSO 4 ) preparation used for colon enema (Guerbet Micropaque Colon, Guerbet, Villepinte, \u00cele-deFrance, France) was mixed into our PVA solutions. Although BaSO 4 at concentrations greater than 60% can drastically alter MR relaxation time, lower concentrations of around 1%-8% do not appear to significantly alter MR relaxation times or interfere with image signal. 19 Solutions were prepared with 8%, 6%, 3%, and 1% w/w BaSO 4 of the initial base solution.\nTo enhance the signal in T1 weighted images, copper sulfate (CuSO 4 ) was added to the PVA mixture in small quantities. CuSO 4 has been widely used as a MR contrast agent since the late 1970s in phantoms used for MR performance validation such as the recently developed Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) phantom. 20 Minute quantities of CuSO 4 dramatically increase the contrast of the PVA sample in T1 and T2 weighted images. To find an optimal concentration of CuSO 4 , we prepared 0.2%, 0.1%, 0.05%, and 0.025% (w/w) anhydrous CuSO 4 PVA-C samples and imaged them with T1 and T2 imaging sequences.\nThe appropriate concentrations of talcum, BaSO 4 , and CuSO 4 were determined by choosing the PVA-C samples that had the least amount of contrast agent but still gave qualitatively good MR, CT, and US contrast when the PVA-C samples were imaged when submerged in water in a closed container."}, {"section_title": "II.D. Phantom construction", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "II.D.1. Brain mold", "text": "The mold for our brain phantom was based on the left hemisphere of the Colin-27 data set. 1 The cortical surface of the left hemisphere was segmented using Freesurfer 21 produce a polygonal surface mesh, which was then processed using the butterfly subdivision module in MESHLAB (Ref. 22) to refine the cortical surface represented by the mesh and also reduce the number of facets in the mesh. We then subtracted this processed cortical surface mesh from a rectangular prism mesh using the boolean operator in Blender3D, 23 in order to create a \"negative\" of the cortical surface for fabricating our brain mold. After manually correcting the polygonal mesh model for holes, unconnected mesh fragments, and inverse surface normals, the model was then saved in the STL file format, which is commonly used for stereolithographic printing.\nWe utilized the services of RedEye On Demand (Eden Prairie, MN, USA) for the fabrication of our brain phantom mold using the TangoPlus Polyjet Resin (FC-930) as the material. This clear photopolymer was deposited layer by layer in order to produce a finished three dimensional object (see Fig. 2 ). We found that the mold made using this rubbery material was able to accurately model the sulci and insular region of the cerebral hemisphere while having enough flexibility to allow the PVA-C to be unmolded without damaging the phantom or the mold itself. The mold reverts itself to its original shape when deformed.\nThe bottom of a plastic tub was cut out and glued around the opening of the flexible rubber mold. This allowed us to cast a base for our phantom when unmolded and also limited its relative movement when placed and imaged in another plastic tub of the same size and format.\nThe mold component for the left ventricle of the phantom was constructed separately using silicone bathroom caulk. Layers of caulk approximately 2 mm thick were applied to vellum traces from life-size printouts of segmented 2 mm sagittal sections of the left ventricle. These layers were then assembled medially to laterally and aligned using crosshairs on the printout traces to maintain placement accuracy of the sagittal sections and then covered with additional silicone rubber caulk to smooth the mold component surface (see Fig. 3 )."}, {"section_title": "II.D.2. Implants", "text": "To make our phantom useful for tests in image guidance and registration, various structures created from various grades of PVA-C were included into the phantom.\nTo create spherical registration targets/landmarks, we used a harder PVA-C made from 8% PVA solution that has undergone 2 FTC containing high quantities of contrast agents described in Sec. II C for a strong contrast. We found this PVA-C formula to be suitable since it is relatively firm and will not change its shape significantly with phantom deformation. These were molded using the containers for reflective passive spheres used in optical tracking. By using a firmer PVA-C, we limited the amount of distortion that the structure can undergo while enabling the targets to be imaged by US, MR, and CT. These spheres are approximately 11-12 mm in diameter. Together with the phantom cortex landmarks, these internal targets can be used as gold standard markers to verify registration accuracy in the three imaging modalities (see Fig. 4 ). The spheres can be imaged well with ultrasound since they do not have strong specular reflection due to its similar texture to the surrounding PVA-C tissue. This allowed them to be imaged with relatively even contrast from the edge of the sphere to the center. Furthermore, it prevents the heavy US shadowing of the tissues located \"behind\" the sphere.\nA PVA-C \"tumor\" was also created using 4% PVA solution with 1 FTC and then embedded into the phantom. The tumor was molded using the ovoid plastic case from inside a Kinder surprise egg (Ferrero, Pino Torinese, Italy). A small hole was drilled on one of the poles of the egg to allow for expansion during the FTC. The tumor was then placed in the phantom in order to test guidance accuracy in surgical procedures and also to provide another tissue in the phantom of different texture and contrast. "}, {"section_title": "II.D.3. Phantom casting", "text": "The main brain phantom tissue was cast using the optimal liquid PVA-C identified in the experiments described in Sec. II B combined with the contrast agent concentrations selected in Sec. II C. The mixture was poured into the brain mold and any air or bubbles trapped in the sulci are removed such that cavities do not form in the sulcal or gyral surfaces of the phantom.\nThe PVA-C landmark spheres and tumor implants were skewered and suspended using 0.45 mm monofilament fishing lines inside the filled phantom mold at their desired location. The left ventricle mold component was clamped and also suspended with fishing lines in a similar fashion. We found that this technique allowed good positioning of the structures and prevented them from sinking to the bottom of the mold. (see Fig. 5 ).\nFinally, we placed the inflatable head of a urinary catheter into the frontal lobe of the phantom and another in the medial portion of the phantom in the cast base of the mold. Each urinary catheter could be inflated with up to 10 ml of water using a syringe in the manner described by Reinertsen and Collins. 4 This allowed us to vary the extent of deformation on the phantom and conduct experiments on the accuracy of various nonlinear registration algorithms.\nThe entire phantom casting setup was then frozen solid. A thick base for the phantom was cast by pouring an approximately 3 cm thick layer of clear 8% PVA solution over the frozen phantom, which produces a thick layer of PVA-C in the completed phantom of the same thickness. Everything was then allowed to freeze completely over the course of 24 h. Once thawed, the brain phantom readily detaches from the sides of the mold and recovered their original form. An example of the completed phantom can be seen in Fig. 6 ."}, {"section_title": "II.E. Imaging", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "II.E.1.

This ensures that exactly the same physical deformations were scanned in each modality. It is only after the whole series of the multimodal images were acquired for a deformation, that the catheter inflations were changed.

Limitations and future work", "text": "There are several limitations in the current phantom that could be addressed in future work. Notably, our method for selecting the PVA solution concentration and the number of FTCs relies on a subjective assessment. A better approach may be to measure the rheological characteristics of live human brain tissue using MR or US elastography or through direct intraoperative mechanical characterization and use these results to guide the choice of PVA concentration and number of FTCs. This would allow for the ability to select the PVA concentration and FTC as a function of the desired physical and imaging properties of the material. Experiments quantifying the rheological properties of human brain will have to account for the physiological state of the individual patient since different factors such as blood pressure, the administration of pharmaceuticals (e.g., mannitol), or other physiological conditions 27 can dramatically change the rheological properties of the human brain.\nNevertheless, the concentration and number of freezethaw cycles chosen in this study resulted in a texture that was qualitatively comparable to live brain tissue when palpated by an experienced neurosurgeon. Moreover, the phantom created here had rheological characteristics that were similar to those found in the literature in terms of Young's modulus for live human brain and it deforms more realistically than previously proposed deformable brain phantoms in the literature.\nThe phantom proposed in this study could also be improved by devising a method of simulating heterogeneous tissue, since the current version only allows for homogeneous simulated tissue with discrete punctuate insertions. Doing this would make it possible to simulate different brain tissues (e.g., white matter, cortical grey matter, deep grey matter). More sophisticated phantom casting techniques would also make it possible to simulate white matter tracts and blood vessels.\nFinally, it was found that over time the CuSO 4 MR contrast agents tended to diffuse or leak from the landmark spheres into the surrounding tissue. This difficulty could be resolved either by sealing the landmark spheres to eliminate leaking, or find MR contrast agents that will not diffuse out of the spheres."}, {"section_title": "V.
