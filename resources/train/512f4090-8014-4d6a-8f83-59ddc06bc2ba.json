However, it is associated with serious toxic side effects. According to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), JQC may reduce the toxicity induced by LGT. Methods: Ethyl acetate extracts (EAEs) of LGT and JQC were obtained by reflux extraction and intragastrically (ig) administered to mice once a day for 2 weeks at a dose of 60 mg/kg. Blood, in addition to hepatic and nephric tissues, were collected to assess the effects of attenuated toxicity of LGT by JQC, and to explore its preliminary mechanisms.\nResults: The EAE of LGT induced an excessive increase in serum biochemical indicators such as the transferases of alanine (ALT) and aspartate (AST), creatinine (Cr), and urea nitrogen (UN), which were all significantly inhibited by the compatibility of LGT at each ratio (1/ 4, 1/2, 1/1, 2/1, or 4/1) to JQC. Further results indicated that the malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were lowered, however, the enzymatic activities of GST, GPx, SOD, and catalase were elevated in the mouse liver and kidneys following compatibility.\nLGT-induced toxicity is weakened by JQC via compatibility, with a suitable component ratio from 1/4 to 4/1. The preliminary mechanism may be associated with the inhibition of oxidative stress in the liver and kidneys. Aims: To investigate the underlying mechanism of action of glycochenodeoxycholate acid (GCDA), a toxic component of bile salts, in hepatocarcinogenesis and chemotherapy resistance. Methods: Cell proliferation and clonality were measured using an MTT assay and immunofluorescence, and a colony formation assay, respectively. Assessment of apoptosis was performed by flow cytometry. The mRNA and protein levels were analyzed by real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. shRNA was used to silence Stat3 expression. Results: GCDA promoted proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2,, and reduced cell chemosensitivity following 5-FU treatment. GCDA resulted in the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3, Y705) and the upregulation of the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein, myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1). Following silencing of Stat3 expression, Mcl-1 expression was downregulated and the effect of 5-FU on hepatocellular carcinoma cells was reversed. Conclusion: GCDA reduced the chemosensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma cells, likely by the upregulation of Mcl-1 expression via the Stat3 signaling pathway.

As to the increase of the dose, is negatively related to the dose. Conclusions: Lycoris radiata alkali has antitumor activity in vitro, By reducing the tumor cell membrane on the surface of the total protein content, sialic acid content and total cholesterol levels and other chemicals, result in changes of cell membrane structure, and thus interfere with tumor cell differentiation, migration, cell recognition, adhesion and contact inhibition via a decreasing? membrane component content, resulting in the decrease of membrane fluidity, closed, enzyme activity decreased. Lycoris radiatae alkali inhibits normal tumor cell tumore cell membrane ion exchange, d destroys the cell membrane integrity and result in abnormal of tumor cell membrane function. This leads to the destruction of the tumor cells or death. Aims: During the submerged fermentation process, a kind of microbial particle could be formed by filamentous bacteria called mycelia pellet. This bio-material has high effectiveness to absorb colors and heavy metals. The greatest advantages of pellets are fast sedimentation velocity and good biocompatibility. Mycelial pellet was very effective for the immobilization of bacteria and for the degradation of target pollutants as the special carrier. The aim of this work was to obtain an efficient composition of medium for Aspergillus niger Y3. Materials and methods: The composition of the medium was the following: sucrose 10 g/L, NH 4 Cl 1.0 g/L, MgSO 4 \u00c17H 2 O 0.5 g/L and KH 2 PO 4 \u00c13H 2 O 1.0 g/L. The mycelial pellet was under the cultivation condition of pH 7.0, the stirring speed of 160 r/min and the temperature of 37\u00b0C with a production batch time of 72 h. To improve the production of biomass, the optimization of culture medium composition was carried out. Response surface methodology (RSM) was proposed in this study. Variables included sucrose, NH 4 Cl, MgSO 4 \u00c17H 2 O, KH 2 PO 4 \u00c13H 2 O and Box-bBehnken experimental design (BBD) model was used for data analysis. Results: The results showed that the optimum medium composition for the culturing of mycelia pellet of Aspergillus niger Y3 was sucrose concentration 15 g/L, NH 4 Cl concentration 1.0 g/L, MgSO 4 \u00c17H 2 O concentration 0.2 g/L and KH 2 PO 4 \u00c13H 2 O concentration 1.0 g/L. The maximum biomass of the mycelial pellet biomass was 0.6985 g/L, and the predicted biomass of the mycelial pellet was 0.7071 g/L, under optimal condition. The condition to culture the mycelia pellet in a high quality and efficiency was created at a low price of medium and a moderate pellet size. Only 48 h were needed to form the pellet from the spores. To verify the availability and the accuracy of the models, the validation experiment was carried out. The results showed that the predicted value of the mycelial pellet biomass matched with the experimental value of the mycelial pellet biomass. Conclusion: The efficient composition of medium for Aspergillus niger Y3 was achieved. The finding may serve as the basic data and information for the medium composition optimization of mycelial pellet.

Polysaccharides obtained from L. barbarum (LBPS) have protective effects against 6-OHDA-induced PC12 cells apoptosis and prevent damage to retinal ganglion cells from acute ocular hypertension-induced ischemic injury. These encouraging conclusions let us to investigate the protective activities of LBPS on 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine ion (MPP + )-caused PC12 cells apoptosis model. Methods: L. barbarum purified polysaccharides entitled LBPS05 were obtained, and their structure was characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, high performance liquid chromatography, and periodate oxidation-smith degradation reaction. Four mM of MPP + exposure was applied to establish PC12 cell apoptosis model. MTT (3-(4,5-cimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay, JC-1 staining and western blot were used to detect the changes of cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential and the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERKs) in PC12 cells. Results: L. barbarum 05 was obtained by using a DEAE-52 cellulose anion exchange column and a Sepharose G-100 column, and was found to be a fraction with 71.5 kDa molecular weight and with the structure of (1?3), (1?4) and (1?6) linkages. LBPS05 pre-treatment effectively improved cell viability, and restored the mitochondrial dysfunction in MPP \nAims: To study the antibacterial activity of the extracts from the leaves of Liquidambar formosana Hance in vitro, and screen its antibacterial active part. Methods: The 70% ethanol reflux extraction from the leaves of Liquidambar formosana Hance was extracted with petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate and water saturation n-butyl alcohol respectively to get five fractions: petroleum ether extract, chloroform extract, ethyl acetate extract, n-butanol extract and water layer. The Kirby-Bauer (KB) method was applied to detect the in vitro antimicrobial activity of different solvent extracts of Liquidambar leaves to 6 strains. The trace continuous dilution method was used to detect the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Results: Different solvent extracts of Liquidambar leaves in different concentrations showed antibacterial activity to different degrees to Escherichia coli, Salmonella paratyphi B, S.flexneri, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The water layer promoted the growth of all tested bacteria. The other extracts had different degrees of antibacterial activity, and the drug concentration was positively correlated with antibacterial activity. The antibacterial circle diameter of the chloroform extract at the concentration of 100 mg/mL on Escherichia coli, Salmonella paratyphi B, S.flexneri, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was 6, 13, 10, 9, 10, 9 mm respectively; ethyl acetate extract was 18, 17, 17, 17, 17, 15 mm respectively; n-butanol extract 13, 16, 18, 16, 14, 14 mm respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration of different fractions of Liquidambar leaves on different bacteria varied. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of the same extract to different bacteria was also different. The n-butanol extract had the best antibacterial effect on S.flexneri; its MIC was 0.625 mg/mL. The chloroform extract had the best antibacterial effect on Salmonella paratyphi B; its MIC was 0.625 mg/mL. The ethyl acetate extract had the best antibacterial effect on Bacillus subtilis; its MIC was 0.3125 mg/mL. The average MIC of the ethyl acetate extract was the smallest on the tested bacteria. Conclusions: Gram-negative bacteria were more sensitive than grampositive bacteria to leaves of Liquidambar formosana Hance. The ethyl acetate fraction showed the best antibacterial effect on the tested bacteria among the five fractions and can be used as an antibacterial active part of the leaves of Liquidambar formosana Hance.

Yikang decoction is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) that has recently been used to treat female infertility, however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Methods: Mice were randomly divided into four groups: normal, implantation failure (mifepristone treatment), Yikang decoction treatment, and control (physiological saline treatment). The efficacy of Yikang decoction was evaluated by the adhesion of uterine endometrial cells. Results: The number of embryos was markedly reduced following mifepristone treatment. The adhesion of endometrial cells in the Yikang decoction group was significantly increased compared with those in the control group. The expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and integrin avb3 was significantly reduced by treatment with mifepristone, however, the attenuated expression of LIF and avb3 was markedly reversed by treatment with Yikang decoction. Moreover, the expression of integrin avb3 was significantly decreased following LIF siRNA knockdown (P < 0.01). Correlation analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between LIF and avb3 protein expression. Conclusions: Yikang decoction can regulate the expression of avb3 and increase cell adhesion by upregulating LIF expression, thus improving embryo implantation in mice. These data provide solid Results: The expression levels of Galectin-3, CK-19, p53, Livin, VEGF, Cyclin D1, b-catenin, Cyclin, CDK2, TNF-a mRNA, TNF-a, HSP70 mRNA, HSP70, and CXC chemokine receptors 4 (CXCR4) and 7 (CXCR7) were positively correlated with the degree of thyroid carcinoma. The positive expression levels of the above-mentioned proteins were significantly higher than in the adjacent and normal thyroid tissues. The positive expression levels were closely related to the degree of differentiation of TC, lymph node metastasis, depth of invasion, and AJCC stage. The expression of CXCR4 was not associated with lymph node metastasis. The absence of CD56 expression in TC tissues, combined with a high expression level of CK19 and Galectin-3, was of great significance in the differential diagnosis of TC. Conclusion: The sensitivity and specificity of many molecular markers for TC diagnosis were not satisfactory. ROC curves were used to optimize the combination, and the ideal 3 to 4 items were selected to provide the basis for diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and prognosis of TC. Methods: Thoracic slices were obtained from the American Virtual Human Project. The anatomic model of the whole heart was picked up by Mimics. The right atrium and SAN were further isolated, and then meshed into tetrahedral elements by using the software of Hypermesh. The detailed electrophysiological model was finally developed by combining the anatomic structure with the single cellular dynamic models. Aims: To investigate the beneficial effects of naringin on cognitive ability related to learning and memory deficits in mice, and to elucidate its preliminary mechanism. Methods: An acquired learning disability was established in mice with scopolamine, and subsequently naringin was administered orally for 20 days. The Morris water maze test was used to evaluate learningand memory-related behaviors. Following the behavioral test, superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), acetylcholine(ACh), and neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were measured in mouse brain tissue. Results: Naringin decreased the escape latency time and increased the number of crossings as compared with the control group. The levels of ACh and BDNF were significantly increased in the naringin-treated group (P < 0.05) as compared with the control group. Moreover, naringin increased the activity of GSH-Px and SOD, but decreased the level of MDA in mouse brain tissue. Conclusion: Naringin can improve the learning and memory dysfunction induced by scopolamine. It is reasonable to suggest that the mechanism may be related to the promotion of BDNF expression and the increase of ACh levels in the mouse brain \nWu N.\n, Xu S.J.\n1,2 , Liu W.\n, Wang Z.F.\n, Zhou B. Aim: As a highly potential new ingredient for food, Pu'er raw tea from China has many health benefits and a strong cultural foundation. In China, the application of Pu'er tea has a long history. Peopople appreciate that it tastes good but no or few chemistry quality standards have been conducted. The quality of Pu'er tea in all regions does not a history of scientific evaluation that is comparable to other food items. Quality evaluation of Pu'er raw tea has already become an outstanding question. Chromatographic fingerprinting is the generally accepted technique for the assessment and quality control of honey, wine and tea. Therefore, construction of an HPLC fingerprint for the quality evaluation of Pu'er raw tea is a practical way to evaluate it. This thesis is based on 20 batches of Pu'er raw tea of varying ages, a total of 7542 samples as experimental material. We will explore the feasibility that the fingerprint technology can be used for quality evaluation and control of Pu'er raw tea. Methods: The samples were homogenized. Then, 0.5000 g of homogenized sample was accurately weighed and was extracted with 50 mL methanol. Ultrasonic 3 KW extractors were used at 30\u00b0C. The extracting time was 30 min. After filtration, the extracted material was transferred into a flask and condensed until near dryness by rotary evaporator with a water bath at 60\u00b0C. Finally, the residue was redissolved with 2 mL methanol and filtered through a 0.45 lm PTFE filter for HPLC (Shimadzu) analysis. The samples were detected by an C 18 column, gradient elution and UV wavelength detector (SPD-20A) in detection wavelength of 210 nm. The column was used with the mobile phase of methanol-water and a 1 lL volume of sample was injected. The total analysis time was 45 min.\nResults: Under the condition of optimization, 7542 samples of Pu'er raw tea of different ages and batches were analyzed by HPLC. Their HPLC fingerprint was set up and analyzed by the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) chromatographic fingerprint similarity evaluation system [A] 2004 edition software and the SPSS 19.0 software. The chromatographic profiles of the samples from different ages and batches of the 7542 samples of Pu'er raw tea were very similar. The indexesx of similarity were more than 0.9.The chemical constituents of Pu'er raw tea were all separated perfectly under the chromatographic condition above, and the common HPLC fingerprints of Pu'er raw tea contained eight components. The relative standard deviation of stability, repeatability and accuracy were less than 0.38%, 0.65% and 0.38%. The results show by cluster analysis that the quality in different batches of Pu'er raw tea was relatively stable and there were differences in Pu'er raw tea of the same year and different batches.\nThe experimental results show that the method is simple, rapid, stable and has a good reproducibility. The high performance liquid chromatograprhy fingerprint can objectively reflect the characteristics of Pu'er raw tea, and be used to evaluate and control the quality of Pu'er raw tea. , Chen C.L.\n, Yang L.\n, Zhai S.Q. Aims: To explore the preventive and therapeutic effects of oral Lianmei on heat and humidity diarrhea in piglets. Methods: Lianmei was extracted from Coptis chinensis Franch. and Prunus mume Sieb. et Zucc. The berberine hydrochloride content was 23.71% and citric acid was 13.20%. A hot and humid environment was established artificially, and the piglets were fed E. coli to induce a piglet heat and humidity diarrhea model. The therapeutic effects of oral Lianmei were evaluated by changes in antioxidant enzymes, gastrointestinal regulatory enzymes, liver ATP enzyme vitality, and the mRNA expression of duodenal apoptosis gene caspases-3, -8, and -9. Results: The piglets treated with oral Lianmei showed a significant increase in acetylcholinesterase and amylase, and T-SOD and GSH-Px enzyme activity, a reduction in LDH leakage and MDA levels in the serum, and enhancement of Na + -K + -and Ca 2+ -Mg 2+ -ATPase vitality in the liver. Hormones were also involved in the regulation via an improvement in the thyroid growth hormone T3, and a decrease in glucocorticoid secretion. In treated piglets, the expression of genes involved in duodenal apoptosis wasere reduced; caspase-8 by 2.62 fold and caspase-3 by 5.82 fold as compared with untreated piglets. Caspase-3 reduced in a dose-dependent manner. Aims: In contrast to traditional ultrasound imaging methods, synthetic aperture imaging can achieve better resolution through lower operating frequencies and smaller sensor apertures. However, every generation of low resolution image needs a large amount of computation. It reduces the imaging frame rate severlyseverely. An optimized method for medical ultrasound imaging is introduced. Methods: In order to solve this problem, an improved synthetic aperture imaging method based on Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) has been presented. The method used the theory of computational independence to parallelize the generation of image. From a macroscopic perspective, there is a computational independence between the formation of scan lines. From microscopic view, there is a certain degree of independence between the sampling points in the same scan line. Therefore, these features of synthetic aperture imaging method can take full advantage of their independent characteristics as parallel computing.\nResults: In the experiment, the results show that the imaging frame rate using the new method based on GPU parallelization can effectively solve the problem of real-time synthetic aperture imaging. Conclusions: As shown in the results, this new method based on synthetic aperture imaging and GPU parallelization can effectively improve the frame rate of imaging. And on this basis, the quality of ultrasound image will be focused in our research. Aim: Tetrodotoxin (TTX) was discovered in fish such as pufferfish, triggerfish, ocean sunfish. It is produced by infecting bacteria in those fishes. Nevertheless, residents in China still like to consume pufferfish due to its delicious meat [1]. Therefore, pufferfish-poisoning based foodborne illnesses are reported every month, especially from March to May. Method: WeChat is the most popular mobile messaging app for text and voice services [2]. It has more than a billion created accounts and more than 700 million active users in the world. We developed an \"antidote\" public platform based on WeChat. The \"antidote\" could guide accompanying persons to do first-aid treatment, such as inducing vomiting and artificial respiration. In addition, the \"antidote\" could connect the online services of nearby hospitals and try to get professional help. Result: Twenty volunteers were enrolled to test this public platform. One volunteer said the necessary information appeared on his mobile phone just a few seconds after he inputted the keyword (such as TTX and pufferfish poisoning). Another volunteer said \"antidote\" warned him of the possibility of choking on pufferfish, and recommended him of preserving the food swallowed by the victim. Conclusion: The public platform \"antidote\" is knowledge-intensive and prompt to help humans to respond at urgent conditions. Its greatest advantage is its ready availability. In the future, we shall try to use intelligence algorithms [3, 4] Aims: To improve the acquisition of medical knowledge, with a view to advancing medical diagnosis and decision, a novel deep immune learning frame for medical data mining was proposed.\nMethods: According to the statistics, the medical data had at least five characteristics: (1) diversity, (2) incompleteness, (3) privacy, (4) redundancy, and (5) time sequence. Medical data were unstructured in different formats such as signals, images, text, and videos. The incompleteness of medical record data increased uncertainty in diagnosis and decision. The medical data involved patient privacy, which was protected for safety and confidentiality. In order to discover useful medical knowledge from medical data as a whole, with a view to better medical diagnosis and decision, the medical data were preprocessed, adjusted, analyzed, mined, and learned, as shown in Fig. 1 . The medical records and device data were stored in databases and preprocessed in formats for further analysis. As a novel intelligent computing mechanism inspired by the natural immune system, an algorithm was designed with deep immune learning in order to discover and learn useful knowledge from a large number of medical records, as shown in Fig. 2 . All known disease data were classified into the non-self database to build the multi-dimension feature space of non-selves. The feature dimension of this space could be extended to recognize a new class of unknown non-self for unknown diseases.\nResults: Unknown disease data could be learned as a new class of non-self into the feature space of non-selves. , Du J.Y.\n, Hao H.X. Aims: In forensic toxicology, in order to avoid matrix effects from the complex biological samples during the analytical workflow, the procedure before toxicological analysis is a pre-requisite. Sample preparation impacts nearly all the later assayed steps and is hence critical for unequivocal qualitative and quantitative analyses. There is a strong demand for advanced, up-to-date sample preparation technology used by hospitals and forensic toxicology laboratories for sample clean-up, isolation or concentration of target analytes from various matrices. Herein, we introduced the development and application of an emerging sample preparation method employing hollow fiber-based membrane solvent microextraction. Methods: The fiber-based liquid phase microextraction (LPME) used in various biological samples including urine, whole blood, plasma, serum, saliva was reviewed. The extraction principle, development and application in recent years and future directions of this promising sample preparation technique are contained in this review. The paper also elaborates on the other areas such as food science, agricultural science, and environmentology. Results: Hollow fiber-based electromembrane extraction(EME) has a huge potential in speeding up extractions, reducing the consumption of organic solvents and high preconcentration of analytes which are the evaluation index of a sample pretreatment technology. Furthermore, its high selectivity is capable of extracting various acid/alkaline drugs from complex samples. Conclusions: Hollow fiber, as an auxiliary device of liquid phase microextraction, is economical, environmental, stable and highly effective in the chemical application of toxicology analyses. It has a great realistic significance in forensic science due to its portability and the merit which has a good combination with various analytical instruments.

Methods: Forty-eight Sprague-Dawley (SD) male rats were randomly divided into four groups: the sham operation group, the chronic cerebral hypoperfusion model group, the DSS group, and the positive drug control group, with 12 rats in each group. The model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion was established by the permanent deleigation of bilateral common carotid artery. The DSS group and the positive drug control group were respectively treated with DSS at a dose of 2.0 mg/ kg and 6.0 mg/kg. The sham operation group and the model group were given by an equal volume of normal saline. DSS, nimodipine or saline was intragastrically administered daily for 30 days. The damage of prefrontal cortex and hippocampal neurons was detected with the method of Nylon staining, and the expression of caspase-3 in prefrontal cortex and hippocampal neurons was detected with the western blot method. Results: Nissl staining revealed that compared with the model group, the number of positive neurons in the prefrontal cortical and hippocampus neurons significantly decreased in DSS group (P < 0.05), and compared with the nimodipine group, there was no significant difference (P > 0.05).Western-blot detection revealed that compared with the model group, the expressions of Caspase-3 in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampal neurons significantly decreased in the DSS group (P < 0.05). Compared with the nimodipine group, there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). Conclusion: 3 0 -daidzein sulfonate sodium has protective effects on the prefrontal cortex and hippocampal neurons of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion rats, and the protective mechanism may contribute to inhibiting the expression of Caspase-3 and inhibiting the neuron apoptosis of rats after the chronic cerebral hypoperfusion injury.

Methods: According to the principle of skeleton transition, a molecular morpholine in the BMCL-200908069-1 structure was combined with a triazine nucleus, and the oxygen atom was replaced with a sulfur atom to obtain a thiopyranosemide nucleus structure. The aromatic hydrazone structure of BMCL-200908069-1 was replaced with a pyrazole structure. Accordingly, twenty-four novel thiopyrano-pyrimidine compounds containing the pyrazole group were synthesized and the their IC 50 values against the PI3K/mTOR kinases were evaluated in three cancer cell lines. The chemical structures of the compounds were confirmed by 1 H NMR and MS. Results: According to the cytotoxicity and effect on enzyme activity of the compounds, we analyzed the structure-activity relationships of the target compounds. We found that the pyrazole structure significantly increased the antitumor activity of the compounds, with compound 9 showing activities against mTOR and PI3K kinase at 3.8 nM and 66 nM, respectively. These data suggest that novel thiopyranopyrimidine compounds containing pyrazole structures should be synthesized, refined, and tested. Conclusions: A series of pyrazole-containing thiopyrano-pyrimidine compounds were designed and their activities against the PI3K/mTOR kinases were evaluated. The target compounds showed excellent antitumor activity towards the PI3K/mTOR kinases. Therefore, a combination of the two active pharmacophores, the thiopyrano-pyrimidine and pyrazoline groups, resulted in the production of a novel series of PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. \nWang Q.F., Wang Y.T., Hou Y.H.\nAims: An efficient gene engineering method has been developed for the marine actinomyces strain W062 to enhance the anti-microbial activities and cytotoxic activity.

Methods: SNP-level and gene-level analyses were performed on the ADNI cohort data using the Plink software and the Vegas software, respectively. Network-level analysis using the network interface miner for multigenic interactions (NIMMI) strategy was employed to identify the sub-networks. Finally, pathway analysis was used to validate the functional gene sets. Results: The SNP-level and gene-level analyses replicated a few wellknown AD genes including APOE, in addition to identifying several novel genes such as DLGAP1, DSCAM, NAV2, and PCDH9. The network-level analysis identified nine interesting sub-networks, which were replicated as the top findings in two independent analyses. Subsequent enrichment analysis indicated that the genes from these sub-networks were enriched in pathways such as neurodegenerative disease and the nervous and immune systems. Conclusions: Our strategy detected several genes that had previously not reached significance. Moreover, this multi-level framework may provide a novel method by which to identify potential high-level candidate variants.

Aims: To investigate the value of the 3VT section on the examination of the fetal heart. Methods: We conducted a prenatal cardiac ultrasound examination of the observed object and fetal echocardiography, based on the long axis view of the heart and a series of transverse section, 3VT section scanning.\nResults: According to the 3VT section ultrasound image characteristics, the arterial arch axis, aortic arch axis and the short axis of the superior vena cava are from left to right. The short axis image of the upper vena cava shows the right posterior axis. The arterial arch and the aortic arch join and looked like a V-shape. Thirty-five cases of cardiac malformations were observed. The following were observed: 9 cases of pulmonary artery stenosis; 6 cases of aortic atresia; 5 cases of tetralogy of Fallot; 5 cases with persistent left superior vena cava; 3 cases of pulmonary atresia; 3 cases of persistent truncus arteriosus; 2 cases of cardiac pulmonary venous drainage; 1 case of double aortic arch and 1 case of a right aortic arch with left artery catheter and vagal left subclavian artery. In the 35 cases of cardiac malformations, the following were observed: 23 cases of the ductus arteriosus, aortic arch and superior vena cava with abnormal diameter ratio; 3 cases of reduction in the number of blood vessels; 8 cases of an increase of the number of blood vessels and 1 case of abnormal vascular branch at the confluence of the ductus arteriosus and descending aorta. Conclusions: 3VT section was relatively easy to be obtained. In the 3VT section, with the trachea coordinate position, the number, position, diameter of blood vessels and the relationship between them can be observed and analyzed, and the judgment of the image plane can be ruled normal or not. The number of blood vessels increased or decreased; the blood vessel diameter ratio being anomalous and the vascular origin, walking, branch and tracheal showed abnormal vascular structure. The fetal heart wasere examined with 3VT. The cross section, long axis view, comprehensive observation, and comprehensive analysis are the key to improve the fetal heart and great vessel malformation diagnosis rate. Aims: To investigate 3D visualization technology in coronary intervention. Methods: 120 coronary chronic total occlusion (CTO) patients were selected according to the use of a 3D visualization system for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). There were 60 cases in the control group. The two groups of patients were compared and analyzed with respect to the successful rate of intervention and severe complications. Results: The successful cases in the observation and control groups were 88.5% (53/60) and 73.3% (43/60), respectively, with the difference being statistically significant (P < 0.05). The interventional complication rate in the observation and control groups was 3.3% (2/60) and 16.7% (10/60), respectively, with the difference being statistically significant (P < 0.05); and the difference in surgery duration, 75.8 + 9.1 and 100.5+15.7 min, respectively, was also statistically significant (P < 0.01). Conclusions: 3D visualization technology used in the diagnosis and treatment of CTO intervention can significantly improve the success rate, reducing vascular dissection, coronary artery spasm, and vascular complications such as perforation. It is worthy of further promotion and clinical application.

Methods: Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were fed either a normal or high-fat diet (HFD) with or without the anti-obesity drug, Orlistat, and high-, middle-, or low-doses of COSCs for 8 weeks. The food intake, body weight gain, fat pads, body fat ratio, and liver index were measured. Simultaneously, the serum levels of lipid and leptin were evaluated, and liver, heart, and kidney sections were observed. Results: COSCs reduced body weight gain and fat pads, and the high body fat ratio and liver index in rats induced by a HFD, without changing the food intake. Moreover, the serum levels of TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, and leptin were significantly ameliorated. The effect of COSCs was slightly superior to that of Orlistat, and it was demonstrated that COSCs were non-toxic to tissues. Conclusions: Treatment with COSCs slowed the development of HFD-induced obesity in rats, which was most likely associated with an improvement in leptin resistance. \nWang F.L., Hou Z.J., Mu Z.X.\nAims: To investigate the abnormal thyroid function in healthy Cangzhou urban residents. Method: Serum samples were collected from 3218 healthy individuals in Cangzhou city. Levels of TSH, FT3, and FT4 were determined using an immuno-chemiluminescence instrument (Roche Co., Ltd, Germany). Statistical analysis was performed. Results: The detection rate of thyroid dysfunction increased year by year and also with age. The prevalence of hyperthyroidism, subclinical hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and subclinical hypothyroidism was 0.81%, 0.68%, 1.83%, and 4.38%, respectively. The prevalence of subclinical thyroid disease (5.07%) was higher than that of clinical thyroid disease (2.64%). The incidence rate of females was higher than that of males (P < 0.001). The prevalence of hyperthyroidism was higher than that of subclinical hyperthyroidism in both males and females. The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism in abnormal thyroid function was the highest, accounting for 56.9%, followed by hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism. The ratio of male to female was 1:5.4. Conclusion: The detection rate of abnormal thyroid function in urban residents of Cangzhou increasincreaseed year by year, and subclinical hypothyroidism was the main dysfunction. Thyroid dysfunction was related to gender and age. Regular examination of thyroid function in healthy individuals will be helpful in the early and differential diagnosis of thyroid disease. Taking appropriate intervention measures will reduce the incidence of thyroid and related diseases. \nMao Q., Zhao S.G., Gong T., Zheng Q.Q.\nAims: In order to overcome the sensitivity to noise and always trapped in local optimal solution problems, a novel robust hybrid approach based on windowed Fourier filtering (WFF) and improved fuzzy c-mean (FCM) algorithm (W2FCM) has been proposed in this study. Methods: Windowed Fourier transform not only can extract the global frequency information, but also extract the local frequency information. Hence, a thoracic computed tomography (CT) image could be filtered by WFF. After filtering, the image be enhanced by incomplete beta function. As we known, phase congruency plays an important role in image processing. In this paper, the phase and magnitude information of the CT image have been extracted as initial cluster centers in FCM method. Results: The proposed approach is more accurate than traditional methods in lung nodule segmentation. It has high noise tolerance and does not sacrifice computation time. Even more importantly, the proposed approach can get more nodule candidates for the late nodule detection. After segmentation, the shape, size and status of nodule candidates can be seen clearly. Experiments verified that this method is effective and reliable. Conclusions: This study has proposed a novel robust W2FCM algorithm for lung nodule segmentation. This approach has noise tolerance, fast convergence and automatic segmentation advantages. \nPalaniappan P., Lee M.Y., Park S.H., Go S.K., Song C.G.\nAdvanced Biomedical Imaging Center, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju-si, Jeonbuk, South Korea Aims: To image the deeply-implanted optical heterogeneitity from organelles to organs by a custom-developed photoacoustic tomography (PAT) system with a linear array transducer, using optical constrast agents with a laser source to maximize the optical penetration Methods: The functional capabilities of the PAT system were tested by imaging a phantom made from gelatin containing 10-12% water and 88-90% protein. A polymer tube with an internal and external diameter of 0.5 mm and 0.7 mm, respectively, was placed between phantom layers. Contrast agents such as indocyanine green, methylene blue, riboflavin, gold nanoparticles, silver nanoparticles, and infrared (IR-780) iodide were used. Results: The obtained PAT images showed the feasibility and stability of the system. The laser source was tuned to a specific wavelength for each specific agent. In the future, these phantom studies can progress to animal experiments, and these contrast agents can also be loaded with tumour-targeting drugs to verify tumor location.

A novel ankle rehabilitation robotic platform has been proposed to address these challenges. Methods: The proposed rehabilitation robot consists of two symmetrical robotic platform with 3 degree of freedoms (DOFs) each. Each robotic platform employs layer-stacking structure constructed by worm gear pairs and inclined gear pairs to ensure that the rotation center of the foot pedal points to the pivot center of the ankle joint. Three ankle exercise modes, named as constant speed exercise, constant torque exercise and awareness exercise, are developed to execute ankle rehabilitation training for hemiplegic patients in the early recover stage. Results: The preliminary experiments were performed to verify the feasibility of the robot for ankle exercise. They demonstrated that the foot pedal of the robotic platform tracked the instruction with a mean \nXin G.S.\n, Li X., Xue Q.B. Aims: Lycorine widely exists in Amaryllidaceae, which is a kind of chemical monomer isolated from Amaryllidaceae. It has shown various pharmacological effects, such as the anti-tumor effect, the anti-viral, sedation and effects on the cardiovascular system. In recent years, the anti-tumor effect of lycorine was studied by domestic and foreign experts, and there are reports about the obvious inhibition effect of lycorine for human breast cancer MCF-7 cells, leukemia CEM cells and mouse melanoma B16F10 cells. But the mechanisms of its antitumor effect are not very clear. Usually, apoptosis can be caused through mitochondrial pathway, the death receptor pathway and endoplasmic reticulum pathway, and the mitochondrial pathway is the most classic one in apoptosis. The starting point of this thesis is the mechanism of the apoptosis of HepG-2 cells induced by lycorine through the mitochondrial pathway. The early experimental results show that lycorine promotes apoptosis on many kinds of tumor cells, such as the human liver cancer HepG-2 cells is obvious. Lycorine-induced apoptosis of HepG-2 cells was studied to provide the in-depth mechanism and thus a theoretical basis for lycorine of new anti-tumor drugs. Method sand Results: At first this issue examines the inhibition of lycorine for HepG-2 cells growth by MTT assay. Experimental results show that lycorine had obvious effect on human liver cancer HepG-2 cells growth inhibition. With the concentrations of lycorine increasing, HepG-2 cells growth inhibition rates also increased, both with positive correlation. The IC 50 was 5.73 \u0131mol/L. Cell morphology was observed using an inverted microscope and fluorescence microscope, and measured the rate of HepG-2 cells apoptosis in different concentrations of lycorine by the flow cytometry PI staining method. Cell morphology was observed by inverted microscope in different concentrations of drugs for 48 h. The results showed that the negative control group cells grow well and closely arranged with their shape intact. In the administration group, the cell morphology had a series of changes, such as cell rounding, crushing, cell growth gradually thinning, and a large number of cells in a foloating state. The phenomenon is more obvious as the dose increases. Cell morphology was observed by fluorescence microscope in different concertrationsconcentrations of drugs for 48 h. There were apoptotic bodies, and the number of apoptotic bodies increased as the concentrations of lycorine increased. HepG-2 cells apoptosis was observed with diffferentdifferent concentrations of lycorine for 48 h by flow cytometry PI staining method. The results showed that lycorine can induce apoptosis of human liver cancer HepG-2 cells. With increasing concentrations of lycorine, apoptosis rate of human liver cancer HepG-2 cells also increased. Confocal laser scanning microscopy detected the change of mitochondrial membrane potential of HepG-2 cells after treatment by different concentrations of lycorine for 48 h. [Using kit studied Caspase-3 activity in HepG-2 cells after treated by lycorine for 48 h.] The influence of lycorine on expression of mitochondria associated protein Bcl-2\u3001Bax\u3001Cyt-C\u3001 Csapase-9 was analyzed by western blotting. The results showed that increasing concentrations of lycorine could reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential.. Using the microplate reader to detect Caspase-3 activity, the results showed that lycorine could increase Caspase-3 activity with positive correlation. Western Blotting analyzed different concentrations of lycorine in HepG-2 cells. The results showed that in a dose dependent relationship with the increasing lycorine, Bcl-2 protein expression was decreased, Bax protein expression increased gradually, and Bcl-2/Bax protein expression ratio decreased, and. Cyt-C protein expression was increased gradually with the increasing of lycorine concentration. At the same time, lycorine increased Caspase-9 protein expression with positive correlation. Conclusions: The experimental results above show that lycorine can induce apoptosis of human liver cancer HepG-2 cells. The mechanism may be that, lycorine can down-regulate the expression of Bcl-2 protein and up-regulate the expression of Bax protein, the latter can promote MPTP opening and in turn decrease the mitochondria membrane potential of HepG-2 cells. The decrease of mitochondria membrane potential can cause relative high permeability in mitochondria membrane, substrate expansion of mitochondria, and rupture of outer membrane and release of Cyt-C. The release of Cyt-C in cytoplasm can activate caspase cascades reaction and activate caspase-9, finally initiating the activating of Caspase-3 and induce cell apoptosis. This showed that lycorine can induce apoptosis of HepG-2 cells through mitochondrial pathway.

Aims: Diabetic pulmonary fibrosis (DPF) is a severe complication that increases the mortality risk of diabetes. Pulmonary fibrosis is also closely related to diabetes. But, there is no effective clinical drug treatment. Peiminine (PME) is the major alkaloid extracted from the root of fritillary (Chinese herb medicine Beimu). In this work, we investigated how PME improves DPF and the possible mechanism. Methods: A luciferase reporter driven by a Smad (Drosophila gene 'mothers against decapentaplegic) -containing promoter and expressed in a cell line of 293 cell to explore the PME as an inhibitor on the TGF-b/SMD pathway. mRNA or protein expression in WI-38 cells was measured by real-time PCR after high glucose or TGF-b1 incubation. Adult male Wistar rats received streptozocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg, i.p.) by intraperitoneal injection. Fasting glucose levels above 16.8 mM were considered diabetic following STZ injection 2 weeks. Diabetic rat were induced by bleomycin (4 mg/kg, b.w.) and randomized. After treatment with PME 4 weeks or not, lung tissues were isolated for mRNA, western blot or pathological analysis.\nResults: In cell line levels, PME dose and time dependently inhibit the luciferase activity of TGF-b/SMAD. After WI-38 incubate with TGF-b1 or high glucose, protein and mRNA expression of a-SMA, collagen I, collagen IV, E-cadherin were increased, but PME dose and time were dependently reversed. In animal levels, PMF treatment improved the weight loss with significant difference in comparison to the DPF group in the absence of PMF. Pathological results showed that PMF alleviates pulmonary fibrosis induced by BLM. PME? decreases the expression of TGF-b1, p-Smad 2, a-SMA and collagen I in lung tissues. Moreover, the DPF rats showed significantly increased MDA, NF-jB p65 unit, TNF-a, IL-1b and decreased SOD and GSH levels in the lung tissues. Four-week treatment with PME dose-dependently reversed these inflammation and oxidative stress changes in the rats of DPF.\nConclusions: Chronic treatment with PME alleviates DPF, which is associated with TGF-b1 pathway, oxidative stress and inflammation. Aims: This paper discusses the application of RFID in the tracing, positioning, and management of valuable medical instruments, to help to improve their quality and reduce the cost of management. Methods: We assigned a unique code to each device and wrote an RFID tag, which was associated with the background database coding information. Subsequently, RFID was monitored uninterrupted in the measured range through the RFID reader. Finally, with respect to storage, distribution, and use, the valuables management platform for realtime monitoring of expensive medical devices was established.\nResults: The system can be used to monitor the location and condition of valuable medical instruments accurately and in a timely manner. Conclusions: RFID management technology was successfully implemented in medical equipment quality control and statistical analysis to improve the quality of management of medical supplies and to help reduce management costs. -2016-jlxm-20, jit-2016-jlxm-19) Aims: To investigate the protective effects of Liuwei dDihuang decoction on diabetic cardiomyopathy, and to elucidate the mechanism of action. Methods: SD rats were grouped stochastically. With the exception of the control group, animals were administered with streptozotocin by intraperitoneal injection. The treatment groups included: apocynin, aminoguanidine, and 2 doses of Liuwei dDihuang decoction.\nResults: Myocardial hypertrophy and cardiac dysfunction were found in the diabetic model (DM) group as compared with the control group. The mRNA and protein expression levels of endoplasmic reticulum calcium regulatory molecules, including FKBP12.6, SERCA2a, and CASQ2, were downregulated. These were related to cardiac dysfunction and the upregulation of proinflammatory factors such as ET A , PKCe, and NADPH p22 phox in the DM group. Following treatment with Liuwei dDihuang, the abnormal expression of these molecules was significantly reversed. Conclusions: Abnormal expression of calcium regulatory molecules participated in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Liuwei dDihuang decoction improved diabetic cardiomyopathy through the upregulation of disordered calcium regulatory molecules of endoplasmic reticulum.

Methods: Wistar rats were randomly divided into a control group and a DN group. Diabetic nephropathy model rats were induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. The DN group was divided into a model group, BHD group and losartan group. At the end of experiment, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (SCr), 24 h urinary protein (24-h UPr) were measured. Renal tissue was used for morphological examination by micrography. Immunohistochemistry, western blot and Real-time PCR were performed to examine the expression levels of heparanase (HPA) and podocalyxin (PCX) respectively. Results: The results suggested that glomerular basement membrane thickness in DN rats were reduced by BHD treatment. Compared with the model group, Cr, 24-h UPr level and the expressions of HPA in the BHD group was decreased. Meanwhile, BHD could increase the PCX expression both at protein and mRNA levels. Conclusion: Buyang Huanwu Decoction can delay the development progress of diabetic nephropathy. The mechanism is probably related to BHD inhibiting renal HPA expression, upregulating PCX expression, and maintaining glomerular charge barrier integrity.

Methods: In this study, clinical and MRI findings were analyzed retrospectively in 7 child cases of infection secondary to intramedullary dermoid cyst with dermal sinus shown by pathology. An MRI scan was performed in all cases before operation, 5 of which were performed with enhanced MRI. Results: Among 7 cases, 5 cases occurred in the lumbar region, 1 case in the thoracic region, and 1 case in the thoracolumbosacral region. An MRI scan of the spine revealed that the intramedullary dermoid cyst in 6 cases were round-like or oval-like, parallel to the vertical axis of the spinal cord, and the cyst in 1 case was string of beadslike. And the MRI also showed the cyst in 6 cases were well-defined and the cyst in 1 case was ill-defined. Additionally, the dermoid cyst in 7 cases showed hypo-intense on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) and hyper-intense on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI). Among them, 6 cases showed homogeneous signal, 1 case showed heterogeneous. Iso-intense septation on T1WI was seen in 2 cases. As for dermal sinus in this study, MRI showed iso-or hypo-intense both on T1WI and T2WI. Enhanced MRI showed no enhancement in 1 case, slight enhancement in cyst wall of 4 cases, and enhancement in the sinus of 2 cases. Conclusions: Magnetic resonance imaging has important value in diagnosis of infection secondary to intramedullary dermoid cyst with dermal sinus, which can display the location, contour, and signal intensity of intramedullary dermoid cyst and dermal sinus.

Thus, functional proteomic tools were used to evaluate the protective effect of the increased to 20% (w/w) kaempferol content in ethanolic extract (KAREX) obtained from saffron, dry stigmata from C. sativus L., which strictly complied the specified origin status and quality criteria of the European Pharmacopoeia in a rat animal model upon hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Methods: Apoptotic damage to hepatocytes in three groups of male rats: 1) sham, 2) IR, and 3) IR pretreated with KAREX was evaluated by histologic analyses. Redox proteomics assay with the 2-D gel electrophoresis oxyblot and MALDI-MS were applied to clarify the protein carbonylation caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) related with IR. In addition, the preventive effect of KAREX on the hepatic IR injury in rats was revealed with flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry experiments. Results: Significantly decreased carbonylation of specific chaperone proteins, functionally involved in the pro-apoptotic processes, was significantly abolished by KAREX. The five proteins as COMT, SMP30, GRP75, GRP78 and valosin containing protein (VCP) were restored in rat hepatic cells under KAREX pretreatment and this result confirmed data reported earlier by Pan et al. [2]. However, in current studies, some additional not previously reported 10 proteins as RATGSTB, CA-III, beta-actin, APTase-beta chain, HSP60B, catalase, TKT, transferrin, carbamoyl-phosphate synthase and HSC73 were also observed in KAREX treated rats. Conclusion: These results indicated that the kaempferol enriched KAREX effectively attenuated the hepatic cell death process and protein oxidation which could lead to develop a novel therapeutic approaches against ROS related malignances and diseases.

Methods: Sequential IVUS image frames were acquired from human coronary arteries using 20 MHz and 45 MHz catheters. The initial estimation of the vessel wall borders was done manually only for the first frame. After the initialization, pre-processing, including edge preservation, noise reduction, and dead zone preservation, was successively performed on each IVUS frame. To improve the segmentation performance, the image masks of each boundary were determined preliminarily by local binary pattern-based mask initialization. Then, the vessel borders were approximated using a modified distance regularized level set evolution model. The reliability and reproducibility of the manual segmentation were validated in terms of inter-and intra-observer agreement. Evaluation parameters, including area, perimeter, and diameter, were computed from the segmented regions to quantify the detection accuracy. Results: The results indicated superior performance of the proposed method for detecting coronary artery wall from the IVUS images. The proposed method was strongly correlated with the manual segmentation for all evaluation parameters with a high degree of statistical significance (r > 0.716, P < 0.05). In addition, the proposed method was suitable for the three-dimensional vessel reconstructions. Conclusions: These experimental results suggest that the proposed method has clinical applicability for the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases based on IVUS image. Aims: In order to increase the drug load capacity and to prolong drug release time, a streptomycin sulfate (SS) loaded polymer film was prepared on the surface of titanium plate (TP), which may realize longacting anti-infection. Methods: Streptomycin sulfate was encapsulated into maleic anhydride grafted polylactic acid (MPLA) nanoparticles, which were spread evenly on the amino modified surface of TP. Then polyethylenimine (PEI) was filmed on the nanoparticles. Based on the electrostatic attraction of COO -on MPLA nanoparticles and NH + on PEI, the Layer-by-Layer self-assembly (LBL) technique was used to construct SS loaded multilayer films. Prepared TP was placed into a dialysis membrane immersing into PBS with continuous stirring to determine the SS release behavior in vitro. Results: The results of atomic force microscopy and water contact angle measurement suggest that MPLA/PEI multilayer film is successfully synthesized on the surface of TP. The cumulative SS release only reached 68.47% after 120 h with 7 layers of MPLA nanoparticles in the film. Conclusions: The LBL film on TP had the good property of sustained drug release which worked in long-acting antibiosis. It could be inferred that such modified TP would have great potential in implantation of titanium plates.\n038\n042"}, {"section_title": "RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTS OF LYCORINE IMPACT ON THE TUMOR CELL MEMBRANE FUNCTION", "text": "Xin G.S."}, {"section_title": "1,2", "text": ", Ji Y.B.

Lycoris radiata alkali by inverted microscope study found that the function of human liver cancer HepG-2 cells, cells in suspension after the treatment, and as lycoris radiata alkali concentration increases, the longer the duration, the phenomenon is more obvious. Further study on the different concentration can be determined through single staining flow cytometry instrument PI lycoris radiata alkali HepG-2 cell apoptosis under the influence of the situation, The results show that when Lycoris radiata alkali concentration increased, human liver HepG-2 cell apoptosis rate also will increase, a positive correlation; L lycoris radiata alkali can significantly reduce the tumor cell membrane Na + , K + -ATPase and Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ -ATPase activity and membrane fluidity, decrease membrane protein and the content of sialic acid and close capability level, and reduce cholesterol levels. As to the increase of the dose, is negatively related to the dose. Conclusions: Lycoris radiata alkali has antitumor activity in vitro, By reducing the tumor cell membrane on the surface of the total protein content, sialic acid content and total cholesterol levels and other chemicals, result in changes of cell membrane structure, and thus interfere with tumor cell differentiation, migration, cell recognition, adhesion and contact inhibition via a decreasing? membrane component content, resulting in the decrease of membrane fluidity, closed, enzyme activity decreased. Lycoris radiatae alkali inhibits normal tumor cell tumore cell membrane ion exchange, d destroys the cell membrane integrity and result in abnormal of tumor cell membrane function. This leads to the destruction of the tumor cells or death. Aims: The immunoregulatory, neuroprotective and antifatigue effects of Lycium barbarum have been widely reported. Polysaccharides obtained from L. barbarum (LBPS) have protective effects against 6-OHDA-induced PC12 cells apoptosis and prevent damage to retinal ganglion cells from acute ocular hypertension-induced ischemic injury. These encouraging conclusions let us to investigate the protective activities of LBPS on 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine ion (MPP + )-caused PC12 cells apoptosis model. Methods: L. barbarum purified polysaccharides entitled LBPS05 were obtained, and their structure was characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, high performance liquid chromatography, and periodate oxidation-smith degradation reaction. Four mM of MPP + exposure was applied to establish PC12 cell apoptosis model. MTT (3-(4,5-cimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay, JC-1 staining and western blot were used to detect the changes of cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential and the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERKs) in PC12 cells. Results: L. barbarum 05 was obtained by using a DEAE-52 cellulose anion exchange column and a Sepharose G-100 column, and was found to be a fraction with 71.5 kDa molecular weight and with the structure of (1?3), (1?4) and (1?6) linkages. LBPS05 pre-treatment effectively improved cell viability, and restored the mitochondrial dysfunction in MPP + -exposed PC12 cells. L. barbarum 05 regulated the activities of ERKs and Akt in MPP + -exposed DPC12 cells. Conclusion: L. barbarum 05-mediated neuroprotective effects are related to the modulation of ERKs and Akt, and the subsequent shutdown of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.

Methods: The 70% ethanol reflux extraction from the leaves of Liquidambar formosana Hance was extracted with petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate and water saturation n-butyl alcohol respectively to get five fractions: petroleum ether extract, chloroform extract, ethyl acetate extract, n-butanol extract and water layer. The Kirby-Bauer (KB) method was applied to detect the in vitro antimicrobial activity of different solvent extracts of Liquidambar leaves to 6 strains. The trace continuous dilution method was used to detect the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Results: Different solvent extracts of Liquidambar leaves in different concentrations showed antibacterial activity to different degrees to Escherichia coli, Salmonella paratyphi B, S.flexneri, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The water layer promoted the growth of all tested bacteria. The other extracts had different degrees of antibacterial activity, and the drug concentration was positively correlated with antibacterial activity. The antibacterial circle diameter of the chloroform extract at the concentration of 100 mg/mL on Escherichia coli, Salmonella paratyphi B, S.flexneri, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was 6, 13, 10, 9, 10, 9 mm respectively; ethyl acetate extract was 18, 17, 17, 17, 17, 15 mm respectively; n-butanol extract 13, 16, 18, 16, 14, 14 mm respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration of different fractions of Liquidambar leaves on different bacteria varied. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of the same extract to different bacteria was also different. The n-butanol extract had the best antibacterial effect on S.flexneri; its MIC was 0.625 mg/mL. The chloroform extract had the best antibacterial effect on Salmonella paratyphi B; its MIC was 0.625 mg/mL. The ethyl acetate extract had the best antibacterial effect on Bacillus subtilis; its MIC was 0.3125 mg/mL. The average MIC of the ethyl acetate extract was the smallest on the tested bacteria. Conclusions: Gram-negative bacteria were more sensitive than grampositive bacteria to leaves of Liquidambar formosana Hance. The ethyl acetate fraction showed the best antibacterial effect on the tested bacteria among the five fractions and can be used as an antibacterial active part of the leaves of Liquidambar formosana Hance.

Methods: A literature search was carried out to analyze and integrate the papers related to the identification of molecular markers for thyroid cancer.\nResults: The expression levels of Galectin-3, CK-19, p53, Livin, VEGF, Cyclin D1, b-catenin, Cyclin, CDK2, TNF-a mRNA, TNF-a, HSP70 mRNA, HSP70, and CXC chemokine receptors 4 (CXCR4) and 7 (CXCR7) were positively correlated with the degree of thyroid carcinoma. The positive expression levels of the above-mentioned proteins were significantly higher than in the adjacent and normal thyroid tissues. The positive expression levels were closely related to the degree of differentiation of TC, lymph node metastasis, depth of invasion, and AJCC stage. The expression of CXCR4 was not associated with lymph node metastasis. The absence of CD56 expression in TC tissues, combined with a high expression level of CK19 and Galectin-3, was of great significance in the differential diagnosis of TC.

Methods: Thoracic slices were obtained from the American Virtual Human Project. The anatomic model of the whole heart was picked up by Mimics. The right atrium and SAN were further isolated, and then meshed into tetrahedral elements by using the software of Hypermesh. The detailed electrophysiological model was finally developed by combining the anatomic structure with the single cellular dynamic models. The electrical excitation-conduction equation was then solved with the finite volume method by taking advantage of the operator splitting technique. In order to accelerate the solution, the Graphic Process Unit (GPU) and Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) platform were used for programming.\nResults: Action potentials and their conductions were consistent with the normal electrophysiological characteristics.

Aims: To investigate the beneficial effects of naringin on cognitive ability related to learning and memory deficits in mice, and to elucidate its preliminary mechanism. Methods: An acquired learning disability was established in mice with scopolamine, and subsequently naringin was administered orally for 20 days. The Morris water maze test was used to evaluate learningand memory-related behaviors. Following the behavioral test, superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), acetylcholine(ACh), and neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were measured in mouse brain tissue. Results: Naringin decreased the escape latency time and increased the number of crossings as compared with the control group. The levels of ACh and BDNF were significantly increased in the naringin-treated group (P < 0.05) as compared with the control group. Moreover, naringin increased the activity of GSH-Px and SOD, but decreased the level of MDA in mouse brain tissue. Conclusion: Naringin can improve the learning and memory dysfunction induced by scopolamine. It is reasonable to suggest that the mechanism may be related to the promotion of BDNF expression and the increase of ACh levels in the mouse brain Acknowledgments: This work was supported by project grants from The National Natural Science FoundatioFoundationn of China (Grant No. 81603527 Aim: As a highly potential new ingredient for food, Pu'er raw tea from China has many health benefits and a strong cultural foundation. In China, the application of Pu'er tea has a long history. Peopople appreciate that it tastes good but no or few chemistry quality standards have been conducted. The quality of Pu'er tea in all regions does not a history of scientific evaluation that is comparable to other food items. Quality evaluation of Pu'er raw tea has already become an outstanding question. Chromatographic fingerprinting is the generally accepted technique for the assessment and quality control of honey, wine and tea. Therefore, construction of an HPLC fingerprint for the quality evaluation of Pu'er raw tea is a practical way to evaluate it. This thesis is based on 20 batches of Pu'er raw tea of varying ages, a total of 7542 samples as experimental material. We will explore the feasibility that the fingerprint technology can be used for quality evaluation and control of Pu'er raw tea. Methods: The samples were homogenized. Then, 0.5000 g of homogenized sample was accurately weighed and was extracted with 50 mL methanol. Ultrasonic 3 KW extractors were used at 30\u00b0C. The extracting time was 30 min. After filtration, the extracted material was transferred into a flask and condensed until near dryness by rotary evaporator with a water bath at 60\u00b0C. Finally, the residue was redissolved with 2 mL methanol and filtered through a 0.45 lm PTFE filter for HPLC (Shimadzu) analysis. The samples were detected by an C 18 column, gradient elution and UV wavelength detector (SPD-20A) in detection wavelength of 210 nm. The column was used with the mobile phase of methanol-water and a 1 lL volume of sample was injected. The total analysis time was 45 min.\nResults: Under the condition of optimization, 7542 samples of Pu'er raw tea of different ages and batches were analyzed by HPLC. Their HPLC fingerprint was set up and analyzed by the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) chromatographic fingerprint similarity evaluation system [A] 2004 edition software and the SPSS 19.0 software. The chromatographic profiles of the samples from different ages and batches of the 7542 samples of Pu'er raw tea were very similar. The indexesx of similarity were more than 0.9.The chemical constituents of Pu'er raw tea were all separated perfectly under the chromatographic condition above, and the common HPLC fingerprints of Pu'er raw tea contained eight components. The relative standard deviation of stability, repeatability and accuracy were less than 0.38%, 0.65% and 0.38%. The results show by cluster analysis that the quality in different batches of Pu'er raw tea was relatively stable and there were differences in Pu'er raw tea of the same year and different batches."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions:", "text": "The experimental results show that the method is simple, rapid, stable and has a good reproducibility.

Methods: Lianmei was extracted from Coptis chinensis Franch. and Prunus mume Sieb. et Zucc. The berberine hydrochloride content was 23.71% and citric acid was 13.20%. A hot and humid environment was established artificially, and the piglets were fed E. coli to induce a piglet heat and humidity diarrhea model. The therapeutic effects of oral Lianmei were evaluated by changes in antioxidant enzymes, gastrointestinal regulatory enzymes, liver ATP enzyme vitality, and the mRNA expression of duodenal apoptosis gene caspases-3, -8, and -9.\nResults: The piglets treated with oral Lianmei showed a significant increase in acetylcholinesterase and amylase, and T-SOD and GSH-Px enzyme activity, a reduction in LDH leakage and MDA levels in the serum, and enhancement of Na + -K + -and Ca 2+ -Mg 2+ -ATPase vitality in the liver. Hormones were also involved in the regulation via an improvement in the thyroid growth hormone T3, and a decrease in glucocorticoid secretion. In treated piglets, the expression of genes involved in duodenal apoptosis wasere reduced; caspase-8 by 2.62 fold and caspase-3 by 5.82 fold as compared with untreated piglets. Caspase-3 reduced in a dose-dependent manner. Aims: To identify the potential metastasis-associated gene fusions in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC). Methods: Low and high metastatic SACC cell lines were subjected to RNA profiling using paired-end sequencing. Sequencing reads were then analyzed using SOAPfuse and TopHat-Fusion algorithms. Selected fusion genes were confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. Bioinformatic analysis and preliminary cell biological experiments were performed to evaluate the significance of several fusion events. Results: 24 common gene fusions were identified in low and high metastatic SACC cells. 115 and 135 fusion genes were revealed to be specifically expressed in low or high metastatic SACC cells, respectively. 20 fusion events with high span-reading numbers were confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. RAPGEF1-LOC100506990 fusion was found to be specifically expressed in high metastatic SACC and was further identified to be a high recurrence fusion pair in limited clinical SACC specimens, suggesting its potential application in clinical diagnosis. Conclusion: Fusion events represent the heterogeneity of SACC, and the metastasis-associated fusion genes could be used as biomarkers for further clinical diagnosis or as therapeutic targets.\nAims: In contrast to traditional ultrasound imaging methods, synthetic aperture imaging can achieve better resolution through lower operating frequencies and smaller sensor apertures. However, every generation of low resolution image needs a large amount of computation. It reduces the imaging frame rate severlyseverely. An optimized method for medical ultrasound imaging is introduced. Methods: In order to solve this problem, an improved synthetic aperture imaging method based on Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) has been presented. The method used the theory of computational independence to parallelize the generation of image. From a macroscopic perspective, there is a computational independence between the formation of scan lines. From microscopic view, there is a certain degree of independence between the sampling points in the same scan line. Therefore, these features of synthetic aperture imaging method can take full advantage of their independent characteristics as parallel computing.\nResults: In the experiment, the results show that the imaging frame rate using the new method based on GPU parallelization can effectively solve the problem of real-time synthetic aperture imaging. Conclusions: As shown in the results, this new method based on synthetic aperture imaging and GPU parallelization can effectively improve the frame rate of imaging. And on this basis, the quality of ultrasound image will be focused in our research.\nAim: Tetrodotoxin (TTX) was discovered in fish such as pufferfish, triggerfish, ocean sunfish. It is produced by infecting bacteria in those fishes. Nevertheless, residents in China still like to consume pufferfish due to its delicious meat [1] . Therefore, pufferfish-poisoning based foodborne illnesses are reported every month, especially from March to May. Method: WeChat is the most popular mobile messaging app for text and voice services [2] . It has more than a billion created accounts and more than 700 million active users in the world. We developed an \"antidote\" public platform based on WeChat. The \"antidote\" could guide accompanying persons to do first-aid treatment, such as inducing vomiting and artificial respiration. In addition, the \"antidote\" could connect the online services of nearby hospitals and try to get professional help.\nResult: Twenty volunteers were enrolled to test this public platform. One volunteer said the necessary information appeared on his mobile phone just a few seconds after he inputted the keyword (such as TTX and pufferfish poisoning). Another volunteer said \"antidote\" warned him of the possibility of choking on pufferfish, and recommended him of preserving the food swallowed by the victim. Conclusion: The public platform \"antidote\" is knowledge-intensive and prompt to help humans to respond at urgent conditions. Its greatest advantage is its ready availability. In the future, we shall try to use intelligence algorithms [3, 4] Aims: To improve the acquisition of medical knowledge, with a view to advancing medical diagnosis and decision, a novel deep immune learning frame for medical data mining was proposed.\nMethods: According to the statistics, the medical data had at least five characteristics: (1) diversity, (2) incompleteness, (3) privacy, (4) redundancy, and (5) time sequence. Medical data were unstructured in different formats such as signals, images, text, and videos. The incompleteness of medical record data increased uncertainty in diagnosis and decision. The medical data involved patient privacy, which was protected for safety and confidentiality. In order to discover useful medical knowledge from medical data as a whole, with a view to better medical diagnosis and decision, the medical data were preprocessed, adjusted, analyzed, mined, and learned, as shown in Fig. 1 . The medical records and device data were stored in databases and preprocessed in formats for further analysis. As a novel intelligent computing mechanism inspired by the natural immune system, an algorithm was designed with deep immune learning in order to discover and learn useful knowledge from a large number of medical records, as shown in Fig. 2 . All known disease data were classified into the non-self database to build the multi-dimension feature space of non-selves. Aims: In forensic toxicology, in order to avoid matrix effects from the complex biological samples during the analytical workflow, the procedure before toxicological analysis is a pre-requisite. Sample preparation impacts nearly all the later assayed steps and is hence critical for unequivocal qualitative and quantitative analyses. There is a strong demand for advanced, up-to-date sample preparation technology used by hospitals and forensic toxicology laboratories for sample clean-up, isolation or concentration of target analytes from various matrices. Herein, we introduced the development and application of an emerging sample preparation method employing hollow fiber-based membrane solvent microextraction. Methods: The fiber-based liquid phase microextraction (LPME) used in various biological samples including urine, whole blood, plasma, serum, saliva was reviewed. The extraction principle, development and application in recent years and future directions of this promising sample preparation technique are contained in this review. The paper also elaborates on the other areas such as food science, agricultural science, and environmentology. Results: Hollow fiber-based electromembrane extraction(EME) has a huge potential in speeding up extractions, reducing the consumption of organic solvents and high preconcentration of analytes which are the evaluation index of a sample pretreatment technology. Furthermore, its high selectivity is capable of extracting various acid/alkaline drugs from complex samples. Conclusions: Hollow fiber, as an auxiliary device of liquid phase microextraction, is economical, environmental, stable and highly effective in the chemical application of toxicology analyses. It has a great realistic significance in forensic science due to its portability and the merit which has a good combination with various analytical instruments.

Methods: Forty-eight Sprague-Dawley (SD) male rats were randomly divided into four groups: the sham operation group, the chronic cerebral hypoperfusion model group, the DSS group, and the positive drug control group, with 12 rats in each group. The model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion was established by the permanent deleigation of bilateral common carotid artery. The DSS group and the positive drug control group were respectively treated with DSS at a dose of 2.0 mg/ kg and 6.0 mg/kg. The sham operation group and the model group were given by an equal volume of normal saline. DSS, nimodipine or saline was intragastrically administered daily for 30 days. The damage of prefrontal cortex and hippocampal neurons was detected with the method of Nylon staining, and the expression of caspase-3 in prefrontal cortex and hippocampal neurons was detected with the western blot method. Results: Nissl staining revealed that compared with the model group, the number of positive neurons in the prefrontal cortical and hippocampus neurons significantly decreased in DSS group (P < 0.05), and compared with the nimodipine group, there was no significant difference (P > 0.05).Western-blot detection revealed that compared with the model group, the expressions of Caspase-3 in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampal neurons significantly decreased in the DSS group (P < 0.05). Compared with the nimodipine group, there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). Conclusion: 3 0 -daidzein sulfonate sodium has protective effects on the prefrontal cortex and hippocampal neurons of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion rats, and the protective mechanism may contribute to inhibiting the expression of Caspase-3 and inhibiting the neuron apoptosis of rats after the chronic cerebral hypoperfusion injury.

Methods: According to the principle of skeleton transition, a molecular morpholine in the BMCL-200908069-1 structure was combined with a triazine nucleus, and the oxygen atom was replaced with a sulfur atom to obtain a thiopyranosemide nucleus structure. The aromatic hydrazone structure of BMCL-200908069-1 was replaced with a pyrazole structure. Accordingly, twenty-four novel thiopyrano-pyrimidine compounds containing the pyrazole group were synthesized and the their IC 50 values against the PI3K/mTOR kinases were evaluated in three cancer cell lines. The chemical structures of the compounds were confirmed by 1 H NMR and MS. Results: According to the cytotoxicity and effect on enzyme activity of the compounds, we analyzed the structure-activity relationships of the target compounds. We found that the pyrazole structure significantly increased the antitumor activity of the compounds, with compound 9 showing activities against mTOR and PI3K kinase at 3.8 nM and 66 nM, respectively. These data suggest that novel thiopyranopyrimidine compounds containing pyrazole structures should be synthesized, refined, and tested. Conclusions: A series of pyrazole-containing thiopyrano-pyrimidine compounds were designed and their activities against the PI3K/mTOR kinases were evaluated. The target compounds showed excellent antitumor activity towards the PI3K/mTOR kinases. Therefore, a combination of the two active pharmacophores, the thiopyrano-pyrimidine and pyrazoline groups, resulted in the production of a novel series of PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. Aims: Design and analyze bionic artificial brains in neural-humoral environment with multi anesthetic/analeptic factors and least information quality loss.

Aims: To elucidate a network-based framework, guided by ProteinProtein Interaction (PPI) data, for mining high-level network-based associations with better potential for replication and biological interpretation. Methods: SNP-level and gene-level analyses were performed on the ADNI cohort data using the Plink software and the Vegas software, respectively. Network-level analysis using the network interface miner for multigenic interactions (NIMMI) strategy was employed to identify the sub-networks. Finally, pathway analysis was used to validate the functional gene sets. Results: The SNP-level and gene-level analyses replicated a few wellknown AD genes including APOE, in addition to identifying several novel genes such as DLGAP1, DSCAM, NAV2, and PCDH9. The network-level analysis identified nine interesting sub-networks, which were replicated as the top findings in two independent analyses. Subsequent enrichment analysis indicated that the genes from these sub-networks were enriched in pathways such as neurodegenerative disease and the nervous and immune systems. Conclusions: Our strategy detected several genes that had previously not reached significance. Moreover, this multi-level framework may provide a novel method by which to identify potential high-level candidate variants. Aims: To investigate the value of the 3VT section on the examination of the fetal heart. Methods: We conducted a prenatal cardiac ultrasound examination of the observed object and fetal echocardiography, based on the long axis view of the heart and a series of transverse section, 3VT section scanning. Results: According to the 3VT section ultrasound image characteristics, the arterial arch axis, aortic arch axis and the short axis of the superior vena cava are from left to right. The short axis image of the upper vena cava shows the right posterior axis. The arterial arch and the aortic arch join and looked like a V-shape. Thirty-five cases of cardiac malformations were observed. The following were observed: 9 cases of pulmonary artery stenosis; 6 cases of aortic atresia; 5 cases of tetralogy of Fallot; 5 cases with persistent left superior vena cava; 3 cases of pulmonary atresia; 3 cases of persistent truncus arteriosus; 2 cases of cardiac pulmonary venous drainage; 1 case of double aortic arch and 1 case of a right aortic arch with left artery catheter and vagal left subclavian artery. In the 35 cases of cardiac malformations, the following were observed: 23 cases of the ductus arteriosus, aortic arch and superior vena cava with abnormal diameter ratio; 3 cases of reduction in the number of blood vessels; 8 cases of an increase of the number of blood vessels and 1 case of abnormal vascular branch at the confluence of the ductus arteriosus and descending aorta. Conclusions: 3VT section was relatively easy to be obtained. In the 3VT section, with the trachea coordinate position, the number, position, diameter of blood vessels and the relationship between them can be observed and analyzed, and the judgment of the image plane can be ruled normal or not. The number of blood vessels increased or decreased; the blood vessel diameter ratio being anomalous and the vascular origin, walking, branch and tracheal showed abnormal vascular structure. The fetal heart wasere examined with 3VT. The cross section, long axis view, comprehensive observation, and comprehensive analysis are the key to improve the fetal heart and great vessel malformation diagnosis rate. Aims: To investigate 3D visualization technology in coronary intervention. Methods: 120 coronary chronic total occlusion (CTO) patients were selected according to the use of a 3D visualization system for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). There were 60 cases in the control group. The two groups of patients were compared and analyzed with respect to the successful rate of intervention and severe complications. Results: The successful cases in the observation and control groups were 88.5% (53/60) and 73.3% (43/60), respectively, with the difference being statistically significant (P < 0.05). The interventional complication rate in the observation and control groups was 3.3% (2/60) and 16.7% (10/60), respectively, with the difference being statistically significant (P < 0.05); and the difference in surgery duration, 75.8 + 9.1 and 100.5+15.7 min, respectively, was also statistically significant (P < 0.01). Conclusions: 3D visualization technology used in the diagnosis and treatment of CTO intervention can significantly improve the success rate, reducing vascular dissection, coronary artery spasm, and vascular complications such as perforation. It is worthy of further promotion and clinical application.

Acknowledgements: This work was supported by a project grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grand No. 11462022 Aims: To explore the mechanisms of action underlying the lowered toxicity of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook (TW) via processing by Lysimachia christinae Hance (Pro-LC). TW is a medicinal plant that has been widely used in China for centuries and has been proven to be effective in curing rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, this treatment results in severe toxic side effects. The Traditional Chinese Medicine theory suggests that LC may reduce the toxicity caused by TW. Methods: The processed products of TW were prepared by boiling in water together with the LC extract until all liquid had evaporated. Raw and processed TW products were used to prepare ethyl acetate refluxing extractions (EAREs). Each EARE was administered intragastrically to mice for 2 weeks at a dose of 60 mg/kg. Serum biochemical markers were used to evaluate the anti-toxicity action, and hepatic and nephric tissues were examined to evaluate its preliminary mechanisms. Results: The TW raw material led to a significant elevation in serum ALT, AST, Cr, and UN levels, and tissue TNF-a and MDA, and a significant decrease in SOD, CAT, and IL-10 in hepatic and nephric tissues. The above abnormal indicators were all significantly reversed by Pro-LC. Moreover, pathological observation indicated that the TW raw material led to obvious hepatic and nephric tissue injury, however, no significant damage was detected in tissues from the mice treated with the processed product of TW by Pro-LC. Conclusions: Pro-LC could attenuate TW-induced toxicity, with a potential mechanism of preventing oxidative stress damage in vivo.

Methods: Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were fed either a normal or high-fat diet (HFD) with or without the anti-obesity drug, Orlistat, and high-, middle-, or low-doses of COSCs for 8 weeks. The food intake, body weight gain, fat pads, body fat ratio, and liver index were measured. Simultaneously, the serum levels of lipid and leptin were evaluated, and liver, heart, and kidney sections were observed. Results: COSCs reduced body weight gain and fat pads, and the high body fat ratio and liver index in rats induced by a HFD, without changing the food intake. Moreover, the serum levels of TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, and leptin were significantly ameliorated. The effect of COSCs was slightly superior to that of Orlistat, and it was demonstrated that COSCs were non-toxic to tissues. Conclusions: Treatment with COSCs slowed the development of HFD-induced obesity in rats, which was most likely associated with an improvement in leptin resistance.

Methods: Windowed Fourier transform not only can extract the global frequency information, but also extract the local frequency information. Hence, a thoracic computed tomography (CT) image could be filtered by WFF. After filtering, the image be enhanced by incomplete beta function. As we known, phase congruency plays an important role in image processing.

A novel ankle rehabilitation robotic platform has been proposed to address these challenges. Methods: The proposed rehabilitation robot consists of two symmetrical robotic platform with 3 degree of freedoms (DOFs) each. Each robotic platform employs layer-stacking structure constructed by worm gear pairs and inclined gear pairs to ensure that the rotation center of the foot pedal points to the pivot center of the ankle joint. Three ankle exercise modes, named as constant speed exercise, constant torque exercise and awareness exercise, are developed to execute ankle rehabilitation training for hemiplegic patients in the early recover stage. Results: The preliminary experiments were performed to verify the feasibility of the robot for ankle exercise. They demonstrated that the foot pedal of the robotic platform tracked the instruction with a mean error of 1 RPM in the constant speed mode, and moved smoothly in the constant torque mode. Tthe affected side foot pedal tracked the sound side with a maximum mean error of 7.75\u00b0in the awareness exercise mode. Aims: Lycorine widely exists in Amaryllidaceae, which is a kind of chemical monomer isolated from Amaryllidaceae. It has shown various pharmacological effects, such as the anti-tumor effect, the anti-viral, sedation and effects on the cardiovascular system. In recent years, the anti-tumor effect of lycorine was studied by domestic and foreign experts, and there are reports about the obvious inhibition effect of lycorine for human breast cancer MCF-7 cells, leukemia CEM cells and mouse melanoma B16F10 cells. But the mechanisms of its antitumor effect are not very clear. Usually, apoptosis can be caused through mitochondrial pathway, the death receptor pathway and endoplasmic reticulum pathway, and the mitochondrial pathway is the most classic one in apoptosis. The starting point of this thesis is the mechanism of the apoptosis of HepG-2 cells induced by lycorine through the mitochondrial pathway. The early experimental results show that lycorine promotes apoptosis on many kinds of tumor cells, such as the human liver cancer HepG-2 cells is obvious. Lycorine-induced apoptosis of HepG-2 cells was studied to provide the in-depth mechanism and thus a theoretical basis for lycorine of new anti-tumor drugs. Method sand Results: At first this issue examines the inhibition of lycorine for HepG-2 cells growth by MTT assay. Experimental results show that lycorine had obvious effect on human liver cancer HepG-2 cells growth inhibition. With the concentrations of lycorine increasing, HepG-2 cells growth inhibition rates also increased, both with positive correlation. The IC 50 was 5.73 \u0131mol/L. Cell morphology was observed using an inverted microscope and fluorescence microscope, and measured the rate of HepG-2 cells apoptosis in different concentrations of lycorine by the flow cytometry PI staining method. Cell morphology was observed by inverted microscope in different concentrations of drugs for 48 h. The results showed that the negative control group cells grow well and closely arranged with their shape intact. In the administration group, the cell morphology had a series of changes, such as cell rounding, crushing, cell growth gradually thinning, and a large number of cells in a foloating state. The phenomenon is more obvious as the dose increases. Cell morphology was observed by fluorescence microscope in different concertrationsconcentrations of drugs for 48 h. There were apoptotic bodies, and the number of apoptotic bodies increased as the concentrations of lycorine increased. HepG-2 cells apoptosis was observed with diffferentdifferent concentrations of lycorine for 48 h by flow cytometry PI staining method. The results showed that lycorine can induce apoptosis of human liver cancer HepG-2 cells. With increasing concentrations of lycorine, apoptosis rate of human liver cancer HepG-2 cells also increased. Confocal laser scanning microscopy detected the change of mitochondrial membrane potential of HepG-2 cells after treatment by different concentrations of lycorine for 48 h. [Using kit studied Caspase-3 activity in HepG-2 cells after treated by lycorine for 48 h.] The influence of lycorine on expression of mitochondria associated protein Bcl-2\u3001Bax\u3001Cyt-C\u3001 Csapase-9 was analyzed by western blotting. The results showed that increasing concentrations of lycorine could reduce the mitochondrial membrane potential.. Using the microplate reader to detect Caspase-3 activity, the results showed that lycorine could increase Caspase-3 activity with positive correlation. Western Blotting analyzed different concentrations of lycorine in HepG-2 cells. The results showed that in a dose dependent relationship with the increasing lycorine, Bcl-2 protein expression was decreased, Bax protein expression increased gradually, and Bcl-2/Bax protein expression ratio decreased, and. Cyt-C protein expression was increased gradually with the increasing of lycorine concentration. At the same time, lycorine increased Caspase-9 protein expression with positive correlation. Conclusions: The experimental results above show that lycorine can induce apoptosis of human liver cancer HepG-2 cells. The mechanism may be that, lycorine can down-regulate the expression of Bcl-2 protein and up-regulate the expression of Bax protein, the latter can promote MPTP opening and in turn decrease the mitochondria membrane potential of HepG-2 cells. The decrease of mitochondria membrane potential can cause relative high permeability in mitochondria membrane, substrate expansion of mitochondria, and rupture of outer membrane and release of Cyt-C. The release of Cyt-C in cytoplasm can activate caspase cascades reaction and activate caspase-9, finally initiating the activating of Caspase-3 and induce cell apoptosis. This showed that lycorine can induce apoptosis of HepG-2 cells through mitochondrial pathway.

Aims: Diabetic pulmonary fibrosis (DPF) is a severe complication that increases the mortality risk of diabetes. Pulmonary fibrosis is also closely related to diabetes. But, there is no effective clinical drug treatment. Peiminine (PME) is the major alkaloid extracted from the root of fritillary (Chinese herb medicine Beimu). In this work, we investigated how PME improves DPF and the possible mechanism. Methods: A luciferase reporter driven by a Smad (Drosophila gene 'mothers against decapentaplegic) -containing promoter and expressed in a cell line of 293 cell to explore the PME as an inhibitor on the TGF-b/SMD pathway. mRNA or protein expression in WI-38 cells was measured by real-time PCR after high glucose or TGF-b1 incubation. Adult male Wistar rats received streptozocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg, i.p.) by intraperitoneal injection. Fasting glucose levels above 16.8 mM were considered diabetic following STZ injection 2 weeks. Diabetic rat were induced by bleomycin (4 mg/kg, b.w.) and randomized. After treatment with PME 4 weeks or not, lung tissues were isolated for mRNA, western blot or pathological analysis. Results: In cell line levels, PME dose and time dependently inhibit the luciferase activity of TGF-b/SMAD. After WI-38 incubate with TGF-b1 or high glucose, protein and mRNA expression of a-SMA, collagen I, collagen IV, E-cadherin were increased, but PME dose and time were dependently reversed. In animal levels, PMF treatment improved the weight loss with significant difference in comparison to the DPF group in the absence of PMF. Pathological results showed that PMF alleviates pulmonary fibrosis induced by BLM. PME? decreases the expression of TGF-b1, p-Smad 2, a-SMA and collagen I in lung tissues. Moreover, the DPF rats showed significantly increased MDA, NF-jB p65 unit, TNF-a, IL-1b and decreased SOD and GSH levels in the lung tissues. Four-week treatment with PME dose-dependently reversed these inflammation and oxidative stress changes in the rats of DPF.\nConclusions: Chronic treatment with PME alleviates DPF, which is associated with TGF-b1 pathway, oxidative stress and inflammation. Aims: To investigate the protective effects of Liuwei dDihuang decoction on diabetic cardiomyopathy, and to elucidate the mechanism of action. Methods: SD rats were grouped stochastically. With the exception of the control group, animals were administered with streptozotocin by intraperitoneal injection. The treatment groups included: apocynin, aminoguanidine, and 2 doses of Liuwei dDihuang decoction.\nResults: Myocardial hypertrophy and cardiac dysfunction were found in the diabetic model (DM) group as compared with the control group. The mRNA and protein expression levels of endoplasmic reticulum calcium regulatory molecules, including FKBP12.6, SERCA2a, and CASQ2, were downregulated. These were related to cardiac dysfunction and the upregulation of proinflammatory factors such as ET A , PKCe, and NADPH p22 phox in the DM group. Following treatment with Liuwei dDihuang, the abnormal expression of these molecules was significantly reversed. Conclusions: Abnormal expression of calcium regulatory molecules participated in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Liuwei dDihuang decoction improved diabetic cardiomyopathy through the upregulation of disordered calcium regulatory molecules of endoplasmic reticulum. Acknowledgements: This work was supported by The National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant No. 81400300 Aims: To explore the protective effects of Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BHD) on the renal function of diabetic nephropathy (DN) rats and its preliminary mechanism. Methods: Wistar rats were randomly divided into a control group and a DN group. Diabetic nephropathy model rats were induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. The DN group was divided into a model group, BHD group and losartan group. At the end of experiment, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (SCr), 24 h urinary protein (24-h UPr) were measured. Renal tissue was used for morphological examination by micrography. Immunohistochemistry, western blot and Real-time PCR were performed to examine the expression levels of heparanase (HPA) and podocalyxin (PCX) respectively. Results: The results suggested that glomerular basement membrane thickness in DN rats were reduced by BHD treatment. Compared with the model group, Cr, 24-h UPr level and the expressions of HPA in the BHD group was decreased. Meanwhile, BHD could increase the PCX expression both at protein and mRNA levels. Conclusion: Buyang Huanwu Decoction can delay the development progress of diabetic nephropathy. The mechanism is probably related to BHD inhibiting renal HPA expression, upregulating PCX expression, and maintaining glomerular charge barrier integrity.\nG. insarnatum fermentation mycelia (GIM) in cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced immunosuppressed mice model. Methods: Balb/c mice were intraperitoneally injected with 80 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide for three days to establish the immunosuppressed mice model. Immunosuppressed mice were orally treated with saline and 0.25, 0.5 and 1 g/kg GIM once a day for two weeks. Another 10 mice were injected with 0.16 mg/kg of Thymosin a1 twice a week for two weeks, which served as positive control group. Ten normal mice treated with saline served as the control group. After the last treatment, blood and organs were collected for further determination. Results: Compared to non-treated immunosuppressed mice, two-week GIM treatment strongly increased organ indices, and enhanced the cytotoxicity of NK cells and the proliferation of lymphocyte. Moreover, GIM positively regulated the production of IgG and IgA, and serum levels of interleukin -2, 6, and 10. All data support that GIM possesses immunomodulatory activities in the CTX-induced immunosuppressed mouse model. Aims: There is considerable interest in small molecule inhibitors of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of tyrosine kinases for the treatment of cancer. 4-Amino quinazoline derivatives are significant inhibitors of the human epidermal growth factor receptor and play an key role in the treatment of cancer, saving or prolonging the life of patients. Our target is to synthesize the new 4-amino quinazoline derivatives with strong inhibition ability and high selectivity as candidate drugs. Methods: The 4-phenylamino-6-methoxy-7-(3-thio ester) propoxy quinazoline derivatives were synthesized from N 0 -(5-(3-chloropropoxy)-2-cyano-4-methoxy phenyl)-N, N-dimethylformamidine by cyclization, thioetheration.

Results: Under the condition of reaction temperature 125\u00b0C and in nitrogen gas, the yields of the products were the higher. These structures were characterized by IR, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, MS and elemental analysis. Conclusions: Three desired compounds, including ethyl 2-(3-(4-(3-chlorophenyl amino)-6-methoxyquinazolin-7-yloxy)propylthio)acetate, ethyl 2-(3-(4-(3-bromophen ylamino)-6-methoxyquinazolin-7-yloxy) propylthio)acetate, and ethyl 2-(3-(4-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenylamino)-6-methoxyquinazolin-7-yloxy)propylthio)acetate, were synthesized and the yields were 77.2%, 63.7% and 61.2%, respectively. Results: The minimum inhibitory concentration of Litsea cubeba oil on Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, Candida dubliniensis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Candida krusei is 0.125%, 0.125%, 0.063%, 0.063%, 0.125%, 0.125% respectively. Conclusions: Litsea cubeba oil measured in the experiment on the MIC of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Candida krusei are basically consistent with the reported experimental results. It should be noted that Litsea cubeba oil had a better inhibitory effect on Candida dubliniensis, and its inhibitory effect is greater than that of Candida albicans. The fact that the oil had more of an inhibitory effect on Candida dubliniensis has provided the basis and ideas for the research of lLitsea cubeba oil on the anti Candida dubliniensis.\nAims: The purpose of this study is to evaluate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristic and its value in the diagnosis of infection secondary to intramedullary dermoid cyst with dermal sinus in children. Methods: In this study, clinical and MRI findings were analyzed retrospectively in 7 child cases of infection secondary to intramedullary dermoid cyst with dermal sinus shown by pathology. An MRI scan was performed in all cases before operation, 5 of which were performed with enhanced MRI. Results: Among 7 cases, 5 cases occurred in the lumbar region, 1 case in the thoracic region, and 1 case in the thoracolumbosacral region. An MRI scan of the spine revealed that the intramedullary dermoid cyst in 6 cases were round-like or oval-like, parallel to the vertical axis of the spinal cord, and the cyst in 1 case was string of beadslike. And the MRI also showed the cyst in 6 cases were well-defined and the cyst in 1 case was ill-defined. Additionally, the dermoid cyst in 7 cases showed hypo-intense on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) and hyper-intense on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI). Among them, 6 cases showed homogeneous signal, 1 case showed heterogeneous. Iso-intense septation on T1WI was seen in 2 cases. As for dermal sinus in this study, MRI showed iso-or hypo-intense both on T1WI and T2WI. Enhanced MRI showed no enhancement in 1 case, slight enhancement in cyst wall of 4 cases, and enhancement in the sinus of 2 cases.\nConclusions: Magnetic resonance imaging has important value in diagnosis of infection secondary to intramedullary dermoid cyst with dermal sinus, which can display the location, contour, and signal intensity of intramedullary dermoid cyst and dermal sinus.

Thus, functional proteomic tools were used to evaluate the protective effect of the increased to 20% (w/w) kaempferol content in ethanolic extract (KAREX) obtained from saffron, dry stigmata from C. sativus L., which strictly complied the specified origin status and quality criteria of the European Pharmacopoeia in a rat animal model upon hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Methods: Apoptotic damage to hepatocytes in three groups of male rats: 1) sham, 2) IR, and 3) IR pretreated with KAREX was evaluated by histologic analyses. Redox proteomics assay with the 2-D gel electrophoresis oxyblot and MALDI-MS were applied to clarify the protein carbonylation caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) related with IR. In addition, the preventive effect of KAREX on the hepatic IR injury in rats was revealed with flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry experiments. Results: Significantly decreased carbonylation of specific chaperone proteins, functionally involved in the pro-apoptotic processes, was significantly abolished by KAREX. The five proteins as COMT, SMP30, GRP75, GRP78 and valosin containing protein (VCP) were restored in rat hepatic cells under KAREX pretreatment and this result confirmed data reported earlier by Pan et al. [2] . However, in current studies, some additional not previously reported 10 proteins as RATGSTB, CA-III, beta-actin, APTase-beta chain, HSP60B, catalase, TKT, transferrin, carbamoyl-phosphate synthase and HSC73 were also observed in KAREX treated rats. Conclusion: These results indicated that the kaempferol enriched KAREX effectively attenuated the hepatic cell death process and protein oxidation which could lead to develop a novel therapeutic approaches against ROS related malignances and diseases.

Methods: Sequential IVUS image frames were acquired from human coronary arteries using 20 MHz and 45 MHz catheters. The initial estimation of the vessel wall borders was done manually only for the first frame. After the initialization, pre-processing, including edge preservation, noise reduction, and dead zone preservation, was successively performed on each IVUS frame. To improve the segmentation performance, the image masks of each boundary were determined preliminarily by local binary pattern-based mask initialization. Then, the vessel borders were approximated using a modified distance regularized level set evolution model. The reliability and reproducibility of the manual segmentation were validated in terms of inter-and intra-observer agreement. Evaluation parameters, including area, perimeter, and diameter, were computed from the segmented regions to quantify the detection accuracy. Results: The results indicated superior performance of the proposed method for detecting coronary artery wall from the IVUS images. The proposed method was strongly correlated with the manual segmentation for all evaluation parameters with a high degree of statistical significance (r > 0.716, P < 0.05). In addition, the proposed method was suitable for the three-dimensional vessel reconstructions. Aims: In order to increase the drug load capacity and to prolong drug release time, a streptomycin sulfate (SS) loaded polymer film was prepared on the surface of titanium plate (TP), which may realize longacting anti-infection. Methods: Streptomycin sulfate was encapsulated into maleic anhydride grafted polylactic acid (MPLA) nanoparticles, which were spread evenly on the amino modified surface of TP. Then polyethylenimine (PEI) was filmed on the nanoparticles. Based on the electrostatic attraction of COO -on MPLA nanoparticles and NH + on PEI, the Layer-by-Layer self-assembly (LBL) technique was used to construct SS loaded multilayer films. Prepared TP was placed into a dialysis membrane immersing into PBS with continuous stirring to determine the SS release behavior in vitro. Results: The results of atomic force microscopy and water contact angle measurement suggest that MPLA/PEI multilayer film is successfully synthesized on the surface of TP. The cumulative SS release only reached 68.47% after 120 h with 7 layers of MPLA nanoparticles in the film. Conclusions: The LBL film on TP had the good property of sustained drug release which worked in long-acting antibiosis. It could be inferred that such modified TP would have great potential in implantation of titanium plates.

Background: Stem cell therapy is another medical revolution following drugs and surgery. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess significant self-renewal and multilineage differentiation properties, and can be harvested from the bone marrow, adipose tissue, skin, umbilical cord blood, umbilical cord, and peripheral blood, as well as other organs \u30101-5\u3011. Here, we report a case of a 63-year-old female with acute disseminated myelitis whose disease was not sensitive to classical medication, but was sensitive to umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (UC-MSC) treatment. The patient recovered well 2 months post-UC-MSC transplant. Aims and Methods: To observe the therapeutic effects of UC-MSC on acute disseminated myelitis. We recruited a 63-year-old female whose disease was not sensitive to classical medication. The patient received a UC-MSC transplant 4 times (1 x 10 9 ). We subsequently extracted the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and evaluated the differential proteins using the sequential windowed acquisition of all theoretical fragment ions technique. Results: The patient made an encouraging recovery following UC-MSC transplant. We identified a total of 813 proteins in the patient's CSF, 116 of which were differentially-expressed between pre-and post-treatment samples, including tropomyosin receptor kinase C (TrkC, post:pre-treatment >3), neurotrophic factor-3, which promotes regeneration of the nervous system (NT-3, post:pre-treatment = 3.79), hepatocyte growth factors (HGFs), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). The functions of such proteins suggest that the pathway is involved in evading apoptosis and promoting angiogenesis. Conclusions: UC-MSC transplant may be a promising treatment for acute disseminated myelitis patients whose disease is not sensitive to classical medication. The 116 differentially-expressed proteins between pre-and post-treatment samples may be promising novel therapeutic targets. Aim: To investigating the influence of Polygonum cuspidatum anthraquinones and Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) jointly on the renal monocyte chemotactic protein-1(MCP-1)/tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) in early diabetic nephropathy (DN) rats and to explore the possible mechanisms of them, which can provide the experimental basis for clinical application of DN. Methods: We used an intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (65 mg/kg) to induce the Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat model, with fasting blood glucose equal to or larger than 16.7 mmol/L as the successful model of the experimental basis. SD rats were randomly divided into 7 groups: normal group; model group; Polygonum cuspidatum anthraquinone group; PNS group; Polygonum cuspidatum anthraquinone/PNS (1:1) group; Polygonum cuspidatum anthraquinone/PNS (1.5:1) group; Polygonum cuspidatum anthraquinone/PNS (1:1.5) group,and 10 rats in each group. Normal group and model group rats per 100 g body weight were administrated with normal saline 1 mL. Polygonum cuspidatum anthraquinone/PNS (1:1, 1.5:1, 1:1.5) group rats were given respectively for anthraquinone of Polygonum cuspidatum anthraquinone (8.75 mg/kg, 13.13 mg/kg, 8.75 mg/kg) and PNS (35 mg/kg, 35 mg/kg, 52.5 mg/ Kg), daily irrigation stomach administered once, medicine for 8 weeks. The expression of MCP-1 and TNF-a in rat kidney was determined by immunohistochemistry, and the morphological changes of the kidney were observed by optical microscope. The strength of the immunohistochemical reaction can be shown by Integral Optical Density (IOD) that was used to represent the intensity of the immunohistochemical reaction. Results: Compared with the model group, the expression of MCP-1 in each drug group was decreased.

In order to develop and utilize the new media in the hospital publicity, the paper provided some reference to formulate the propaganda model that suits the management and development of the grass-roots hospital, thus achieve the maximum effectiveness of publicity. Method: After reading the relevant literature, self-designing and improving the questionnaire after consulting the relevant experts, the authors made two surveys on the local residents of a Second Grade Hospitals in Xianning City during two periods, March to April of 2015 and March to April of 2016. A total of 2000 questionnaires were distributed and 1806 of them were collected as valid ones after removing the invalid ones. So the effective rate was 90.3%. The data that did not adopt optimized new media propaganda model before March of 2015 was set as the control group and the data that used the optimized propaganda model from 2015 April to 2016 April was set as the observation group. Based on the feedback from the residents in the survey results in 2015 and the problems in the application process, the paper puts forward a series of reform measures, including richening the content of official website, Weibo and We-Chat, reasonably controlling frequency of pushing messages to ensure the timeliness of the information, enhance the use of the publicity function of the new media platform, establishing a systematic and scientific hospital publicity management system. The paper selected the hospital's basic information, activities, activity policies, new media platform and other comprehensive information to compare the differences of the understanding degree between the two groups. The paper adopted SPSS18.0 for the database analysis and collected the original data for comparison between the groups. A chi-square test was adopted and P < 0.05 for the difference was statistically significant. Result: Control group: The total score of the residents' understanding degree on the comprehensive information of the hospital was 36.91%. Among it, the score for the understanding degree on the basic information of the hospital was 46.87%, the score for the understanding degree on the hospital activity and policy was 31.66%, and the score for the understanding degree on the hospital new media platform was 28.08%. Observe group: the residents' scores in understanding the hospital comprehensive information, the basic information package, activities and policies, the new media platform in hospital was respectively, 57.31%, 63.05%, 53.73% and 55.15% (all of P < 0.05). These results indicated that after optimizing the publicity model, the understanding degree of residents on hospital information has been significantly improved and the differentiation wasere significant between them. As a result, the optimization of the new media publicity model in the hospital publicity and management has a positive effect. Conclusion: Through the optimization and application of the new media publicity and management model, the public's understanding degree on the hospital's basic information, theme activities, fees, preferential policies and new media advertising platform and other comprehensive information has great improvement, this means the optimized hospital publicity model is of certain value to the popularization and application in primary hospitals. Aims: In view of the human emotional research, most mental functions relate to functional interactions within the emotion network. As the real-time functional MRI (fMRI), neurofeedback (rt-fMRI NF) can play an important role in the emotion regulation, learning direct control over functional connectivity might provide a novel approach improving emotion regulation ability. Methods: We showed for the first time that participants could learn to change functional connectivity within the emotion network by controlling the functional connectivity between the left amygdala and the right superior medial gyrus, which are involved in emotion processing. An Region of interest (ROI)-based feedback group whose regulation target was the activation of the left amygdala, as well as sham-feedback group and none-feedback group in our experiment was set as a comparison.\nResults: After training, participants in the connectivity-based feedback group successfully self-regulated the target connectivity, and showed more significant enhancement in amygdala-prefrontal connectivity than other groups.\nConclusions: Our results demonstrate that connectivity-based neurofeedback training enhances emotion regulation capacity, and facilitates the greater modulation of emotion network. The connectivity-based approach can contribute to therapeutic emotion regulation protocols for neuropsychiatric disorders."}, {"section_title": "GENOME-WIDE PROMOTER DYNAMICS OF DNA METHYLATION IN TISSUE-SPECIFIC CHANGES DURING DEVELOPMENT", "text": "Cai Y.N. 1 , Yang R.H. Aims: During the development of the mammalian genome, DNA methylation changes frequently. These changes are important to gene expression and certain other processes. Elucidating how and to what extent CpG islands (CGIs) are methylated during cell development is essential to understanding the function of DNA methylation and its relationship to gene expression. Methods: Changes in DNA methylation at 13,296 autosomal promoters in the liver tissue from C57BL/6J mice at three stages of development (newborn, NB; embryo aged 15 days, E15; adult aged 12 weeks, AD) were analyzed. Results: Changes in DNA methylation are not stable but instead dynamic. During the development process, both demethylation and de novo DNA methylation took place. Among the CpG-poor promoters, we found no obvious relationship between methylation and gene activity. However, with respect to de novo methylation, there appeared to be preferential targets. In comparison, the majority of promoters in strong CpG islands were unmethylated. There was a negative correlation between the DNA methylation status and the HCP activities. Moreover, some short motifs were overrepresented in the methylated regions, suggesting that they may play a role in the targeting process. Conclusions: Our study shows that the methylation states of promoters can be predicted by their sequences and gene function during tissue development. Aims: To summarize the research progress in the identification of thyroid cancer-related genes in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of thyroid cancer. Methods: A literature review was carried out to collect and analyze papers related to thyroid cancer genes. Results: Ras gene mutations often occur in the early stages of thyroid carcinoma (TC). The H-ras gene mutation rate was related to the degree of differentiation. The N2-ras mutation was the most predominant in follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), and more than 90% of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) had the rearrangement, with RET/PTC1 also being relatively common. The mutation rate of the p53 gene was closely related to PTC differentiation, lymph node metastasis, depth of invasion, and AJCC stage. The detection rate of BRAF gene mutations in PTC was very high, and was related to postoperative recurrence. The expression of Bcl-2 and Survivin was closely related to the histological type, pathological grade, clinical stage, and lymph node metastasis of TC. Conclusion: Co-detection of thyroid cancer-related genes and the use of ROC curves to elucidate the optimal combination of 3 to 4 ideal Aims: Osimertinib, a epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, is mainly used to the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with specific epidermal growth factor receptor sensitivity (EGFRm + ) T790M resistance mutations and inefficacy after other EGFR blockers treatment. Compared with previous reported EGFR inhibitors gefitinib and afatinib, osimertinib showed excellent activity against H1975 cell line, with the IC 50 values at the nanomolar level. What's more, osimertinib also has lower cytotoxicity and side effects. In this research, we analyzed and summarized the existing synthetic method of osimertinib, and found the best industrial production route for the synthesis of osimertinib. Methods: We analysed all reported synthetic routes of osimertinib through comparing raw material costs, yield, post-processing method, by-product species, and the degree of risk of the reaction operation, and determined the suitable commercial production way of synthesizing osimertinib. The structures of all compounds were determined by 400 MHz spectrometer ( 1 H NMR) and mass spectra (MS). Results: By analyzing the results of the various routes, we discovered a suitable industrial production way for synthesizing osimertinib.

Methods: To determine the dynamic changes in H3K9me3 and H3K9ac in bovine preimplantation embryos and oocytes, IVF preimplantation embryos were collected at different stages of development and immuno-stained for H3K9me3 and H3K9ac. Results: H3K9me3 and H3K9ac were distributed in the nucleus of oocytes and embryos, and have a similar trend in dynamic change. H3K9me3 and H3K9ac were expressed in GV stage oocytes but not in MII oocytes. Strong H3K9me3 and H3K9ac signals were observed at the 2-cell and 4-cell stage and were maintained during IVF early embryo development, however were not seen at the 8-cell stage. Nevertheless, notably, almost no signals were found in 8-cell IVF embryos. Conclusion: H3K9me3 and H3K9ac signals were maintained in bovine IVF early embryo development, with the exception of at the 8-cell stage. These results suggest that H3K9me3 and H3K9ac may play essential roles in bovine IVF early embryo development. Aims: Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the world. Spasticity is one of the disorders that often occur in the aftermath of a stroke. The intramuscular application of botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) has emerged to be an established treatment to reduce muscular hyperactivity due to spasticity. Ultrasound image guided BTX-A injection has been applied widely for muscular spasm treatment. The key of this method is to extract the transverse section in ultrasound images and allow the needle into the center point. However, it is difficult to localize a muscle in muscle groups due to the low image quality of the ultrasound. Methods: This paper presents a novel method to recognize the transverse section of a muscle in muscle groups in ultrasound images. First, a changing area is produced by the passive movement of the muscle while concerned limb is being pulled. Second, three areas: severe, slowly and no changing are selected from the ultradsound images. The energy of gray co-occurrence matrix obtained from the three area are is compared. Final, a model is built to represent the intensity of image changing. Results: The method was verified by two images sequences obtained from two volunteers. Energy is closely related to the intensity of image changing. 2D ultrasound images showing transverse sections of target muscles were recognized by the proposed model."}, {"section_title": "RECOGNITION OF MUSCLE TRANSVERSE SECTION IN ULTRASOUND IMAGE BASED ON GRAY CO-OCCURRENCE MATRIX", "text": "Luan K. 1 , Wang H.Y. 1 , Li J. 1 , Liu J.L."}, {"section_title": "DEVELOPMENT OF AN ARM ROBOT WITH HUMAN-LIKE MOTOR NERVE MODEL FOR NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION TRAINING", "text": "Wang C.B.

The synthetic route is described here. Methods: Chlorobenzyl cyanide was combined with three bottles of apis (500 mL) and heated to 100\u00b0C for 3-3.5 h. 1 mL methylene chloride was mixed with 1.3 mL water and stirred for 10 min. The solution was left to cool for 10-15 min, and 0.6 mL sodium bisulfite was subsequently added and stirred for 10-10 min, and left to cool for a further 10-15 min to separate the lower organic layer. Next, 0.6 mL methylene chloride was used for extraction, merging the organic layer. Washing steps were carried out with 0.6 L saturated sodium bicarbonate and 0.65 L saturated brine, and dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate for 1-2 h, enriching to a dry oily matter, which was mixed with 1.2 mL n-hexane, cooled, stirred thoroughly, and filtered. A light yellow crystal resulted, which was dissolved in 4.3 mL anhydrous methanol, and sodium bicarbonate and pyridine hydrochloride were then added for phase transfer catalyst. After feeding, the system was heated to reflux for approximately 5 h, and then cooled to 0\u00b0C with mixing for 1.5-2 h. Washing steps were carried out using 3 mL water 2-3 times, and then 1.4 mL cold methanol. After being dried, the reaction was heated for 5 h, to yield a white/yellow granular crystalline powder. Potassium hydroxide was dissolved in 3 mL water and cooled to 10\u00b0C, then clopidogrel isopropyl alcohol was added for phase transfer catalyst. The reaction was heated to reflux while stirring for more than 8 h, and then cooled to room temperature. 6N hydrochloric acid was added to pH to 6-7 and mixed to crystallization for 2-3 h at 0-5\u00b0C. The reaction was filtered with 2.5 mL water after fully drying, cooled to 0-5\u00b0C, mixed, filtered, and dried in a vacuum at 0.08-0.1 MPa, 40-45\u00b0C. The reaction was baked for 1 h at 60\u00b0C and then for 8-12 h to yield a white/yellow granular crystal. Results: The preparation methods of clopidogrel were reviewed and clopidogrel was finally synthesized from 2-chlorobenzyl cyanide via bromination, condensation, hydrolyzation, esterification, and resolution. Finally, the sulfate was re-crystallized as the target compound clopidogrel. Aims: Currently, terrorist bombings occur all over the world. In China, the selective and efficient detection of hazardous explosives such as hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) and cyclotetramethylenete-tranitramine (HMX) are increasingly important for public safety. Therefore, nano materials and an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLI) were adopted as sensing technology for the detection of RDX and HMX, experimentally. Methods: It has been reported that the luminol-functionalized silver/ graphene oxide composite (luminol/AgNPs/GO) and N-(aminobutyl)-N-(ethylisoluminol)/hemin dual-functionalized graphene hybrids (A-HGNs) indicated excellent ECL activity. Herein, a label-free electrochemiluminescence immunosensor for RDX detection was developed. Firstly, positively-charged chitosan-coated A-H-GNs were introduced into the reservoir of an indium-doped tin oxide electrode by drying at room temperature. Secondly, negatively-charged luminol/AgNPs/GO modified with a monoclonal antibody against RDX were dropped onto the surface of the electrode for 6 h at 4\u00b0C, which was designed to form an anti-biotin-SA-luminol-AgNPs-GO/CS-A-H-GNs/ITO electrode (i.e., an immunosensor) through simple electrostatic adsorption interactions. This sensing platform could offer an excellent ECL signal interface with the recognition site. Results: When RDX is present, a remarkable decrease in the ECL signal is observed as a result of the formation of an RDX-antibody complex. RDX can be detected according to the differences between the previous and current signals. It was found that the limit of detection was reaching ppt level. Conclusion: The immunosensor can be proposed for the detection of explosives with a high sensitivity. Our group will analyze the selectivity and stability of the sensor, and apply the technology to practical cases of explosives detection in water and soil.

Aims: To explore the protective effect of sasanquasaponin (SQS) on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in Rats. Methods: A total of 30 male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into three groups: sham-operated group, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury model group and SQS group, with ten rats in each group. The myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury model was induced by ligaturing the left anterior descending artery. The model group and the SQS group were ligated for 30 min and then released for 180 min. The left ventricle coronary artery of the sham-operated group was only exposed, not ligatured. Ten min before ligaturing, the SQS group was injected with SQS 1 mg/kg through the sublingual vein of rats. The sham-operated group and model group were injected with equal volume normal saline. After administration, the cardiac hemodynamic changes were recorded with the physiological recorder, and the morphological changes of myocardial tissues were observed by Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) stain. Results: Compared with the model group, the heart rate (HR), the left ventricle systolic pressure (LVSP) and the maximum of decrease rate of left ventricular pressure (-dp/dtmax) value of the SQS group increased significantly (P < 0.05), and the maximum of increase rate of left ventricular pressure (+dp/dtmax) value of the SQS group increased significantly (P < 0.01). The myocardial fiber of the shamoperated group was arranged in order, without degeneration, necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration in myocardial interstitium. The myocardial fiber of model group was presented with disorder arrangement, congestion and myocardial interstitial edema. The inflammatory cell infiltration was increased obviously and myocardial necrosis was occurred. In the SQS group, the disorder condition of myocardial fiber arrangement was improved,edema was relieved, and the inflammatory cell infiltration and myocardial necrosis in myocardial tissue were significantly reduced . Conclusion: Sasanquasaponin has a protective effect on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats, and the effect may be associated with the improvement of cardiac hemodynamic function and myocardial tissue structure. Aims: Bioaugmentation was one of popular directions in the field of wastewater treatment research and played an important role in the field of improving water quality and system operational stability.

The age of spore was 20-26 day, the culturing temperature was 37\u00b0C, the initial culturing pH was 7.0, shaking speed was 160 r/ min, and mycelial pellet was formed after 2 day. The mycelial pellets and algaes (Scenedesmus obliquus) were inoculated in the domestic sewage at the same time. The fungus-algae pellets were formed after 6 h with 30\u00b0C, 160 r/min, 3000 lux. Efficiency of fungus-algae pellets for treatment of domestic sewage: In order to investigate its removal effect on ammonia nitrogen and COD of domestic sewage, the fungus-algae pellets were applied in the flask. Comparisons of the performances were conducted between two flasks inoculated with mycelial pellets and algaes respectively. Results and conclusion: The removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen with fungus-algae pellets was 78%, significantly higher than the removal efficiency of the control with mycelial pellets which was 50% and the removal efficiency of the control of algaes which was 61%. The removal efficiency of COD with fungus-algae pellets was 69%, much higher than the removal efficiency of the control with mycelial pellets which was 37% and The removal efficiency of algaes which was 45%. It was proven that mycelial pellets as biomass carrier was feasible. The effectively immobilized microalgae, stability maintaining of microalgae in the system, and target pollutants degradation with high efficiency were achieved. Advanced Biomedical Imaging Center, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju-si, Jeonbuk, South Korea Aims: Coupling medium for photoacoustic tomography (PAT) plays a vital role in the acquired strength of the acoustic signal. The purpose of this study was to investigate temperature elevation of the coupling medium during guidance to acquire the maximum intensity in photothermal therapy (PTT). Methods: We used 10% IR 780 iodide loaded-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLGA-PEG) micelles as the imaging sample. The water temperature of the custom-developed PAT system was varied from 25\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C in a specialized water tank. The speed of sound when varying the temperature was accounted for. The PTT images (Therm-App) were acquired using a continuous laser with 1 W/cm 2 power. Results: The intensity variations in PAT images were mapped using the developed algorithm. The PAT signal rises as the temperature of the water increases. Prior to conducting the PTT in a specimen, the increased PAT signal was used to identify the location of the tumour. Conclusions: The improved PAT signal as a result of increasing the temperature of the coupling medium effectively located the tumor in the specimen, enabling maximum intensity during PTT.

Aims: Lycorine are rich in Amaryllidaceae plants, which contain a variety of unique biological and pharmacological activity, such as antitumor, anti-bacterial, anti-virus and other pharmacological effects. Lycorine can serve protection to the cardiovascular system, central nervous system. As a natural ingredient found in nature, lycorine has a rich content, and it has a wide range of pharmacological activity. In recent years, its anti-tumor effect has received attention among research scholars. As an important component of tumor cells, cell membranes play a vital role in the maintenance and regulating of the physiological characteristics of tumor cells. If cell membranes change, the tumor cells will shift and proliferate. If a drug working on tumor cells plays a role, it must pass through cell membranes first, and in the process, changes in membrane function will change with biochemical reaction membrane. Therefore, in order to show the influence of H 22 cells membrane biochemistry and structure of the material induced by lycorine, we verify how derivatives of [lycorine can affect the cell membrane structure, changes in membrane structure and affect its function channels, thereby inducing cell death, to achieve the antitumor effect. This would, provide a theoretical basis for the anti-tumor mechanism of lycorine.\nMethod sand Results: Our group intends to study 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/ kg, 40 mg/kg lycorine working on H 22 tumor cell membranes to have an impact. Lycorine would cause the membrane to produce changes in physiological activity, and lead to an anti-tumor. We used methods in vitro to measure the impact to the immune organs of tumor-bearing mice after they were given lycorine. We detected how different concentrations of lycorine influence the chemical composition protein content of the cell membrane of Aims: Use a formant comparison and measuring bio-signal to find pronunciation difficulty factors for Chinese Korean language learners during speaking processing.

Aim: Long-term chronic hyperglycemia caused the damage of blood vessels or microvascular is the major risk factor for complications of diabetes. In recent years, many studies have shown that the lungs may be one of the target organs of diabetes, and the lung damage of diabetes attracts growing concern. Arctigenin (ARC), a compound isolated from Arctium lappa L., has the effect of anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic nephropathy. This paper aims to study the role of ARC on alleviate diabetic lung damage. Methods: After adjusting for 1 week, the rat was given an intraperitoneal inject streptozotocin 65 mg/kg after fasted 4 h. After 2 weeks, fasting blood glucose was measured. Above 16.8 mM was considered diabetic and rats with blood glucose above this level were used for this study. The diabetic animal was randomized during the 16th week and allocated into four groups (n = 10 per group) to receive treatment: 1) streptozocin(STZ) = vehicle, 2) insulin = 1 IU/kg, 3) ARC-H = 50 mg/kg ARC, 4) ARC-L = 12.5 mg/kg, and administration with ARC for 4 weeks. Fasting blood glucose, insulin levels and glycosylated hemoglobin were measured. After the animal sacrificed, the lung tissue was taken for pathological or western-blot analysis.\nResults: Insulin or ARC can lower fasting blood glucose, insulin and glycosylated hemoglobin levels in diabetic rats. The pathologic results indicated that thickening of the basal membrane in the endothelial cells and the basement membrane of the alveolar epithelial cells were improved by the ARC in the diabetic rat. Immunohistochemical results suggest that ARC can reduce the expression of TGF-b1 and collagen IV in the basal membrane and alveolar epithelial cells of the pulmonary capillaries of diabetic rat.

To prepare the nanoparticle complex of hypocrellin B (HB) with modified b-cyclodextrin and the photosensitization of the complex also was investigated. Methods: The b-cyclodextrin was grafted by chitosan under room temperature according to the literature. The 0.5 mg HB was added in 40 mL modified b-cyclodextrin solution (12.5 mg/mL) and mixed in a magnetic stirrer for 7 h at room temperature. Then the complex was dried by a freeze dryer, and the solid inclusion complex was collected. Results: The b-cyclodextrin grafted product (CTS-b-CD) and the complex of HB with chitosan grafted b-cyclodextrin (HB/CTS-b-CD) were prepared by the lyophilization technique. The FT-IR spectrum indicated that the chitosan was grafted on b-cyclodextrin. The max absorption peak of HB from 468 nm was red shift to 491 nm in the complex. Conclusions: The inclusion complex of HB with CTS-b-CD was successfully prepared for the first time. The CTS-b-CD can increase the solubility of HB in water. The maximum absorption peak of HB was red shifted to 491 nm, suggesting that the HB is incorporated in the hydrophobic environment of the CTS-b-CD as reported in literatures. The complex of HB with CTS-b-CD has the drug delivery function as reported in literatures, so it may have important applications in photodynamic therapy (PDT).

Methods: To detect the lumen morphology, the proposed algorithm transformed the polar into Cartesian coordinates of the IVOCT images. The guide wire shadow region and the stent struts could be detected via pattern analysis and interpolated, and the stent struts shadow region was filled with high pixel values. An active contour model was used to detect irregular lumen morphology. Results: Abnormal IVOCT images, including an irregular lumen, could be detected and classified in a few seconds, leading to the understanding of the overall vascular status and determination of cardiovascular diagnosis. Conclusions: The proposed algorithm can help clinicians to better understand the condition of the stented segment. In addition, the protrusion and thrombus can be easily detected. Aims: To investigate the damping adjustment laws of an intelligent knee prosthesis in order to achieve physiological gait. Methods: Physiological gait was evaluated by measuring the knee joint angle curve of healthy individuals at low (0.8 m/s), medium (1.2 m/s), and high (1.8 m/s) speeds. A novel type of single-axis hydraulic damping knee prosthesis was designed, and training methods were proposed related to the stance and swing phase. A knee prosthesis test was performed using a simulation and measurement device. Results: The maximum swing-phase knee-flexion angle in healthy individuals was 60\u00b0to 70\u00b0depending on the speed. When the damper valve closure was 0%, the maximum swing-phase knee-flexion angles of the knee prosthesis were 86\u00b0, 91\u00b0, and 91\u00b0at 0.8 m/s, 1.2 m/s, and 1.8 m/s, respectively. Once the valve closure percentage was changed, the maximum swing-phase knee-flexion angle could be adjusted to between 60\u00b0and 70\u00b0at different speeds, and the required valve closure percentages were 25%, 40%, and 70% at 0.8 m/s, 1.2 m/s, and 1.8 m/ s, respectively. Conclusions: When the flexion damping valve was fully open, the maximum swing-phase knee-flexion angle increased with the speed augmentation. The required valve closure percentages were different at the various speeds. The higher the speed, the larger the valve closure percentage, and the smaller the valve opening.

Aims: To evaluate the protective effect of silicate bacterial metabolites on rats that have inhaled asbestos. Methods: Eighty healthy male rats were divided into groups; normal control (n = 5), treatment control (n = 5), asbestos-inhaled (n = 35), and asbestos-inhaled treated (n = 35). For the asbestos-inhaled group, the asbestos lung model was established using ultrasonic atomization of asbestos dust, and the rats were subsequently treated with ultrasonic atomization of metabolites from silicate bacteria. For the normal group, the rats inhaled nebulized distilled water. For the treatment and control groups, the rats were treated with ultrasonic atomization of silicate bacterial metabolites. Rats were sacrificed on the corresponding day. Lung and blood samples were extracted for pathological examination."}, {"section_title": "STUDY ON THE EFFECT OF SILICATE BACTERIAL METABOLITES ON EXPERIMENTAL ASBESTOSIS", "text": "The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and hydroxyproline (HYP) were evaluated. The results were analyzed using the statistical software PM3.0. Results: There were no abnormalities in the control group, and the treatment control group was similar, with the exception of a slight occasional inflammatory reaction. Mild acute inflammation could be seen in the asbestos-inhaled group at a early stage, which became chronic inflammation with fibrous tissue hyperplasia, and over time the fibrosis became more serious. In the asbestos-inhaled treated group, the inflammatory reaction was very minor and only slight fibrous tissue hyperplasia could be seen. There were no significant differences in the levels of MDA, SOD, or HYP between the normal control group and treatment control group, as well as the lung index. However, the SOD, MDA, HYP of asbestos-inhaled group and asbestos-inhaled treated group were higher than those of the normal control group. While the MDA and HYP in the asbestos-inhaled treated group were lower than those in the asbestos-inhaled group, however, the levels of SOD were higher in the former. Aims: Agmatine (AGM) has extensive cytoprotective properties including neuroprotection, cardiac protection, and renal protection, which have been fully established by several research studies. Considering that studies on AGM are limited with respect to sepsis and inflammatory lesions, we aimed to evaluate the protective effect of AGM on acute lung injury, acute peritoneal inflammatory injury, and sepsis in C57BL/6 mice. Methods: The models of acute lung injury and acute peritoneal inflammatory injury were reproduced in C57BL/6 mice by zymosan (ZYM, 500 mg/kg). Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was conducted to establish a sepsis model in C57BL/6 mice. Histological examination of the lung was carried out and evaluated on a scale from 0 to 3. The magnitude of pulmonary edema was evaluated by the wet/dry weight ratio. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the lung tissue was detected using a commercial kit. Cytokine production in the three above-mentioned animal models was measured by ELISA. A TransAM NF-jB p65 transcription factor assay kit was used to quantify the DNA binding activity of NF-jB in lung tissue. Results: AGM (200 mg/kg) relieved acute lung injury induced by ZYM, resulting in a lower W/D weight ratio, lower histological scores, and decreased MPO activity in the lung tissue. The levels of TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6 in the lung and BLF were also decreased. Furthermore, AGM dramatically reduced the levels of KC, MIP-2, TNF-a, and IL-6 in the serum and peritoneal lavage fluid following ZYMinduced acute peritoneal inflammatory injury. In the CLP model, AGM dramatically decreased the serum levels of vascular endothelial biomarkers (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, VEGF, vWF, Ang-2, and MCP-1) and inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-10). The potential mechanism of AGM in ZYM-induced inflammatory injury was confirmed to be blockade of the activation of NF-jB by inhibition of the phosphorylation and degradation of IjB. Conclusions: AGM inhibited the activation of the NF-jB signaling pathway, in turn protecting mice against acute lung injury, acute peritoneal inflammatory injury, and sepsis. This suggests that AGM may be a potential agent for the treatment of inflammatory disorders."}, {"section_title": "Methods:", "text": "We built a smart mobile health monitoring system based on wireless networks.

However, ECG signals are corrupted by several artifacts such as power lines, baseline drift, and motion artifacts. These artifacts hamper the real diagnosis process for heart diseases. In this paper, we proposed a wavelet transformation method for subtracting noise from ECG signals. Methods: Wavelet transformation is one of the popular techniques for ECG denoising. Choosing an appropriate threshold for noise subtraction is a difficult task. The proposed algorithm was based on Daubechies 4 discrete wavelet functions, which adapts the threshold value at each level to subtract noise from ECG signals. Each wavelet decomposition level has two coefficients; details and approximation. The maximum and the minimum values for the approximation coefficient (Ac) were calculated. The threshold value is defined as T next = T previous + max(Ac)\\min(Ac). When the approximation coefficients (Ac) is greater than the threshold value, the threshold value will be subtracted from the approximation coefficients .But on the other hand, if the approximation coefficient (Ac) is less than the threshold value, the approximation coefficients (Ac) will be zero . Results: To evaluate our algorithm we added non-leaner and leaner noise with 20 MIT/BIH ECG data. We used the Matlab wavelet toolbox for comparison of our method using different thresholding methods. The average SNRs (signal to noise ratios) of the wavelet fixed, heuristic, and minimax rigorous thresholding methods were -14.4267 db, -12.2267 db, -14.467 db, and -13.4267 db, respectively. The average SNR of the proposed algorithm was -4.8801 db. These results indicate that our method is better than other thresholding methods. Conclusions: In ECG signal analysis, the signal character is essential. In this study, we tried to minimize the ECG denoising error based on the Daubechies 4 wavelet method using adaptive thresholding. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm was more effective than the fixed, heuristic, or minimax rigorous thresholding methods and helping to detect heart diseases more effectively. Aims: To evaluate a method for the assessment of the deacetylation degree (DD) of chitooligosaccharides (COS) with relatively high and low molecular weights, since the methods for the determination of chitosan content recommended by the Chinese Pharmacopoeia are not applicable. Methods: A first order derivative UV spectrophotometric method for the assessment of the DD of COS was established, with the best-suited solvent being 0.3 M hydrochloric acid. The accuracy of this method as a function of molecular weight was also investigated and compared with results obtained using 1 H NMR spectroscopy. Results: The COS samples were divided into low and high molecular mass groups, those with average molecular weights of \u22641000 Da (COS A ) and \u22643000 Da (COS B ). The DD of both groups were evaluated. The two samples were subjected to first order derivative UV spectrophotometry, yielding DD values of 93.44 AE 0.54% and 92.88 AE 0.43% (n = 6), respectively. These values were consistent with those determined by 1 H NMR spectroscopy, which were 93.54 AE 0.16% and 92.85 AE 0.13% (n = 6). Conclusions: This study demonstrated a widely adaptable, highly precise, accurate, and inexpensive method for the determination of the DD of COS, which have the potential for widespread commercial application.\npharmacotherapy of some commercialized anti-cancer drug targeting EGFR (e.g., Gefitinib, Tarceva). Now, several EGFR/c-Met inhibitors of overcoming this resistance have been reported. In this research, we designed and synthesized a series of novel compounds as EGFR/c-Met inhibitors.

The structures of these target compounds were confirmed by MS and 1 H NMR. Results: In summary, we have designed and synthesized a series of quinazoline derivatives which were tested for their anticancer activities against HepG2, A549, MCF-7 and PC-3 and EGFR T790M inhibitory activities. Ten outstanding target compounds exhibited the anticancer activity toward EGFR/c-Met at 10 nM level. Aims: Hippeastrum vittatum, a perennial evergreen herb, belongs to the Hippeastrum. Hippeastrum vittatum goes into liver, spleen and lung channels with the characteristic of sweet, acrid, warm, as well as small toxicity. Hippeastrum contains a variety of chemical constituents, including polysaccharides, flavonoids and their glycosides, alkaloids and glycosides, fatty acids, terpenoids, steroids, amino acids and other trace elements. Clinical studies also show that hippeastrum has the effect of invigorating the circulation of detoxification and blood stasis detumescence. It has been reported that the bulbs of amaryllis contain a large number of biologically active ingredients. But the active ingredients in its leaves have not been reported until now. This paper, aiming to provide a theoretical basis for the further development and use of hippeastrum, is intended to study the chemical composition of hippeastrum dry leaves and their pharmacological activity. Method sand Results: We used heat reflux extraction to obtain chemical compositions in hippeastrum. Solvent extract followed by petroleum ether, methylene chloride, ethyl acetate and n-butanol. We used an 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay to detect the four extracted parts on HepG-2 cells in order to choose a better inhibitive part. We separated and purified the compounds in dichloromethane section by multiplex chromatography and then mixed the liquids with the same Rf value as the same sample fractions. We analyzed the purity of the components by HPLC gradient elution with C 18 column and methanol -water system as the mobile phase at the flow speed of 0.8 mL/min. We recorded the ratio of the mobile phase when the compound peak separated at the baseline. In this chromatographic condition, preparative HPLC can be used to obtain monomer compounds at the flow rate of 2.0 mL/min. Finally, NMR and MS are used to identify the compound's structure and the inhibitive proliferative effect of the compounds is detected on HepG-2 cell line by MTT assay. Conclusions: The MTT assay results show that the four parts extraction of amaryllis leaves significantly and dose-dependently inhibit HepG2 cellular proliferation.
