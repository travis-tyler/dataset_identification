[{"section_title": "", "text": "SST is a difficult parameter to define because the ocean has complex and variable vertical stratification complicated by the presence of laminar and turbulent boundary layers as well as varying meteorological fluxes 1 . The most prolific measurements of SST are satellite radiance measurements, which sample the sub-millimeter skin temperature several times a day.\nOperational centers then modify these measurements based on comparison to in situ observations to produce gridded estimates of temperature of the upper ~1-5 m, referred to as the bulk SST (e.g., Reynolds and Smith, 1994; Reynolds et al, 2002; Rayner et al., 2003) . But many applications, including studies of climate (Manabe and Stouffer, 1996; Deser et al., 2003; Seager et al., 2002) , biogeochemical cycles (Doney et al., 2004) , and fisheries (Block et al., 1997) require estimates of the average mixed layer temperature. In general we may expect MLT to be lower than SST by a few tenths of a degree. This difference reflects the time average effect of the nearsurface suppression of turbulence by daytime warming or by positive freshwater flux.\nThe upper 10 m of the ocean has complex and variable vertical temperature stratification. This variation in stratification occurs more frequently under conditions in which the ocean surface fluxes cause gains or losses of heat or freshwater or in situations of strong horizontal exchange.\nSurface fluxes are responsible for a distinct diurnal cycle in the temperature in the uppermost few meters over wide areas of the ocean when winds are weak and solar heating is strong Gentemann et al., 2003; Clayson and Weitlich, 2007; Kawai and Wada, 2007] . This diurnal cycle is particularly prominent in upwelling areas such as the eastern equatorial Pacific where vertical advection of cool water leads to shallow stratification and thus shallow mixed layers (Deser and Smith, 1998; Cronin and Kessler, 2002) . In the warm pool 1 See the GODAE Global High Resolution SST Pilot Project at http://www.ghrsst-pp.org/SST-Definitions.html region of the western equatorial Pacific diurnal warming arises because the excess rainfall forms a nearsurface barrier layer of low salinity water even though the seasonal thermocline is rather deep [Soloviev and Lukas, 1997] .\nImpact of diurnal warming on SST is addressed by applying various corrections [see e.g. Donlon et al., 2007] assuming that the diurnal thermocline is destroyed by nocturnal convection. But, the diurnal cycle of temperature may be significantly altered over some oceanic regions affected by the surface freshening or upwelling where MLT differs seasonally from bulk SST. In this study we compare historical analyses of bulk SST by Rayner et al. [2003] and Smith and Reynolds [2003] with contemporaneous temperature and salinity profile observations to identify the conditions giving rise to systematic differences between mixed layer temperature and bulk SST and to identify the regions where this difference is essential. These historical analyses of bulk SST are widely used in climate studies and for ocean model validations. Although using bulk SST instead of satellite SST eliminates part of the diurnal warming signal that contributes to the deviation of MLT from skin SST, it also eliminates contribution of satellite SST bias. In this sense we focus on the difference between MLT that is simulated by majority of ocean models and the reference bulk SST that is used to validate ocean models.\nThe mixed layer is defined as the near-surface layer of uniform properties such as temperature and salinity. The presence of weak stratification and the nearness to atmospheric momentum sources give rise to values of the Richardson number consistent with flow instabilities and thus a high potential for turbulent motion. Under conditions where density is primarily determined by temperature de Boyer Mont\u00e9gut et al. [2004] (with a generalization introduced by Kara et al., ) define the base of the seasonal mixed layer to be the depth at which temperature changes by 0.2C from its value at 10m reference depth. From this we can define a seasonal MLT as the vertical average temperature of the mixed layer, which when multiplied by the depth of the mixed layer and the specific heat of seawater gives the heat capacity of the layer of ocean in direct contact with the atmosphere on seasonal timescales.\nThe near surface processes that affect the monthly difference, dT=MLT-SST, are dominated by the integrated effect of diurnal warming. But, a variety of processes including rain, river discharge, or lateral interactions may produce fresh barrier layers that trap the heat near the surface by shoaling the penetration depth of wind stirring and nocturnal convection [Lukas and Lindstrom, 1991; Soloviev and Lukas, 1997] . Moreover, stable salinity profiles may permit nocturnal temperature inversions due to radiative cooling [Anderson et al., 1996; Cronin and Kessler, 2002] with magnitudes comparable to those of diurnal warming. Barrier layers are observed over wide ocean areas; in particular, they are produced by abundant rainfall and river discharge in the tropics, an excess precipitation over the North Pacific, and lateral exchanges across the western boundary currents [de Boyer Mont\u00e9gut et al., 2007] . In all these areas we also expect significant stratification of near surface layers that affect the difference between MLT and SST."}, {"section_title": "Data and Methods", "text": "The mixed layer properties for this study are estimated from individual temperature profiles provided by World Ocean Database 2005, WOD05 et al., 1998 ] are also used.\nThe mixed layer depth (MLD) may be defined in a number of different ways. In this study we use the concept of the isothermal mixed layer depth that is evaluated from individual vertical profiles based on the temperature difference from the temperature at a reference depth of 10 m\n[ de Boyer Mont\u00e9gut et al., 2004] . This reference depth was shown to be sufficiently deep to avoid aliasing by the diurnal signal, but shallow enough to give a reasonable approximation of monthly mixed layer depth. It is worth noting that in some areas of shallow mixed layer, such as the Black Sea, or in areas of strong upwelling, the thermocline may shoal above the 10m reference level. In these particular areas our estimates of MLD may be biased deep and estimates of MLT may be biased cold. In this study the isothermal MLD is defined as the depth at which temperature changes by | | = 0.2 T \u2206 o C relative to its value at 10m depth. Following Kara et al. [2000a] , the isothermal MLD is defined by the absolute difference of temperature, | |, rather than only the negative difference of temperature. Temperature inversions ( >0) are most common at high latitudes. They are accompanied by stable salinity stratification to achieve positive water column stability, and, thus, may be used as an indicator of the base of the mixed layer. The same definition of isothermal mixed layer depth has been used by Carton et al. [2008] who show that the absolute temperature difference criterion works reasonably well even at high latitudes in the North Atlantic where the thermal stratification is relatively weak. In order to reduce the impact of diurnal effects the UK Met Office HadISST1 utilizes only the night satellite SSTs (available beginning in 1981) and adjusts them to match in-situ measurements collected by voluntary observing ships, drifters, and buoys (Rayner et al. 2003) .\nThe NOAA National Climatic Data Center SST extended analysis uses both day and night satellite SSTs only to evaluate the spatial structure of analysis SST while relying on the same in situ observations to adjust their SST analysis to reflect water temperature at an effective depth of ~1-5 m (Smith and Reynolds 2003) . A more precise definition of this analysis depth is impractical for either product because of the variety of depths at which the in situ observations are available. SST adjusted to temperature at a few meters depth is referred to here and after as bulk SST or simply SST. Adjustment to measurements taken from a few meters depth (where the diurnal signal is relatively weak) effectively attenuates but doesn't eliminate impacts of transient Kalnay et al. [1996] ."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "We begin by examining the average dT based on the 1960-2004 WOD05 dataset (Fig. 1a) .\nBecause of the distribution of observations, only the Northern Hemisphere is well sampled. On average, MLT is colder than bulk SST by about 0. Stream north wall in the Atlantic (Fig. 2b) . The ocean also gains heat at a rate exceeding 100 Wm -2 in the eastern equatorial Pacific cold tongue (Fig. 2b ) due to abundant solar radiation and relatively weak local latent heat loss over cool SSTs in the cold tongue. In the cold tongue the heat gain is compensated by entrainment cooling. In the near surface it produces remarkable magnitudes of diurnal warming. We shall next analyze the origins of persistently shallow stratifications in these three regions."}, {"section_title": "Eastern Equatorial Pacific", "text": "The equatorial Pacific thermocline shoals eastward in response to annual mean easterly winds that, along with entrainment cooling, form a tongue of cool water in the east. Here, in the cold tongue, the ocean gains heat from the atmosphere in excess of 100 Wm -2 (Fig.2b) that is compensated by entrainment cooling. In response to this surface heat flux the near-surface ocean develops substantial diurnal warming of SST, in excess of 0.2\u00b0C [Deser and Smith, 1998 ]. Here, average is approximately -0.4 dT o C (Fig. 3a) with more negative values (MLT<SST) in March when SST reaches its monthly maximum and diurnal warming is large (Fig. 3b) [Cronin and Kessler, 2002] . In contrast, on interannual timescales dT is weak (MLT 249 250 \u2248 SST) when El Ni\u00f1o warms SST, the mixed layer deepens, solar radiation decreases and freshwater input increases, and has negative extreme during the La Ni\u00f1as when the mixed layer shoals and atmospheric convection shifts westward [Cronin and Kessler, 2002; Clayson and Weitlich, 2005] . In Fig.3a this relationship is clearest after the early 1980s as the data coverage increases. To identify the mechanisms giving rise to differences in seasonal and ENSO changes in dT we examine a one-dimensional mixed layer model simulation beginning with homogeneous initial conditions (Fig. 4b) . indicates that reanalysis fluxes provide reasonable variability associated with ENSO (Fig.4) . The model responds seasonally to weakened winds in boreal spring ( Fig. 4d ) with increased nearsurface stratification ( <0) as observed. The conditions arising during the onset of El Ni\u00f1o similar to those occurring during the first half of 1997 are somewhat different. During those months the winds also weakened, but solar heating decreased (Fig. 4c ) and freshwater input increased (Fig. 4d) as a result of the eastward shift of convection. The decrease in the ocean heat gain due to decreased solar heating is accompanied by increased latent heat loss due to warmer SST (Fig. 4c) . The result is weakening values of dT followed in the summer and fall by occasional temperature inversions. In mid-1998 through early 1999, as El Ni\u00f1o transitioned into cooler La Ni\u00f1a conditions, the nearsurface again becomes strongly stratified due to enhanced solar heating and weaker latent heat loss and resulting diurnal warming of the nearsurface. Good comparison between one-dimensional mixed layer model simulation and observed dT suggests that the processes governing are one-dimensional and include local response of the mixed layer to changes in wind forcing and heat flux. Fig. 4a) and simulations (Fig. 4b) . They are associated with nocturnal cooling of shallow freshwater lenses produced by enhanced rainfall (Fig. 4d) . Stable salinity stratification (barrier layer) produced by local rainfall captures the nocturnal convection in the near surface layer until the cooling or wind stirring is strong enough. If the freshwater surface flux is set to zero, the one-dimensional model doesn't simulate temperature inversions [see also Anderson et al., 1996] . As we have seen the stable salinity stratification produced by local rainfall may impact significantly the near surface temperature stratification. An alternative mechanism of barrier layers formation is associated with the lateral interactions. In particular, in the equatorial Pacific near the dateline, salty and warm water can be subducted under the western Pacific's warm fresh water to form barrier layers [Lukas and Lindstrom, 1991] . This advection mechanism, which is not in an one-dimensional model's physics, may be effective near the frontal interfaces and contribute to temperature inversions during the seasons when the ocean loses heat."}, {"section_title": "Gulf Stream", "text": "In the western North Atlantic, MLT differs from bulk SST along the Gulf Stream path (Fig. 1 ).\nThis regional anomaly may result from differences in spatial interpolation of MLT and bulk SST that may be an issue in regions of sharp SST fronts. To eliminate the potential impact of spatial interpolation, the MLT-SST is also computed from individual CTD and Argo profiles (Fig. 5 ).\nThis reveals noticeable seasonal variation of MLT-SST that is not expected if the difference in spatial interpolation dominates the signal. In summer, MLT is colder than bulk SST in the cold sector of the Gulf Stream front due to abundant net surface heating and relatively weak evaporation over cool SSTs (Fig. 5a ). Analysis of vertical profiles (Fig.6a) indicates that this heating produces a warm layer trapped in a 10-20m deep shallow fresh layer. This shallow barrier layer limits the depth of nocturnal convection and mechanical stirring above the base of halocline and thus separates the shallow near surface warm layer (that is still observed at 2 a.m.\nlocal time) from the seasonal mixed layer. This shallow warm layer affects water temperature in the depth range of 1-5m used to adjust the bulk SST analysis. This, in turn, explains the cold difference between MLT and bulk SST observed north of the Gulf Stream north wall in summer.\nNegative in this region is statistically significant and shows up in the tail of the regional histogram (Fig.1a) . In contrast, an examination of the spatial structure of MLT-SST during the winter months (Fig.   5b ) shows large inversions frequently exceeding 1\u00b0C along the path of the Gulf Stream, while SST is close to MLT in this area in summer. Winter MLT-SST inversions are aligned along the northern wall of the Gulf Stream (Fig. 5b) , suggesting mechanisms involving cross-frontal interactions between contrasting water masses. Collision of warm and salty Gulf Stream water with colder and fresher shelf water produces shallow salinity stratified cold near-surface layers (Fig. 6b) . These layers are further cooled by oceanic net surface heat loss and eventually destroyed by passing storms. In spite of that, the ocean areas affected by the temperature inversions might be more frequently observed by satellite infrared sensors. In fact, passing winter storms that eventually destroy the inversions are usually associated in the Gulf Stream area with the cold air outbreaks and significant convection cloudiness that obscure infrared imageries of the sea surface. Winter MLTs warmer than SSTs are observed over a spatially narrow area along the Gulf Stream north wall. As a result, their contribution is not seen in the shape of histogram evaluated over a wider area shown in Fig.5b .\nExamination of the meridional variations of dT also shows the strongest temperature inversions over the warm Gulf Stream (Fig.2c) . Variations of are similar if an alternative, gradientbased definition of the mixed layer depth is used (Fig.2c) . Seasonal variations of MLT-SST in the Gulf Stream region occur in accord with the seasonal variations of the net surface flux that dT displays very large heat loss over the warm Gulf Stream in winter (e.g. Dong and Kelly, 2004) and strong warming over the cold shelf sector in summer. In distinction from the equatorial Pacific, where interannual significantly correlates with local SST, these values are weakly correlated in the Gulf Stream area (Fig. 3c) . The above discussions emphasize impacts of salinity on the near-surface temperature stratification. Next, the temperature response to the presence of the near-surface salinity gradients (occurring in the Gulf Stream area) is explored with a one-dimensional mixed layer model (Fig. 7) . To contrast the impact of salinity, the twin runs are compared. Each pair of model runs is forced by the same fluxes but differs in initial conditions. The first (control) run starts from the vertically homogeneous temperature and salinity while the initial salinity profile for the second run has salinity decreasing toward the surface in the upper 20 m at a rate of 0.1 psu m -1 (in accord with observations in Fig. 6 ). between the two runs that shows an impact of the near surface freshening. In the presence of a stabilizing salinity gradient the diurnal warming is stronger during the first day of simulations (Fig. 7b) , but is surprisingly similar during the second day when it is limited by the shear instability of diurnal currents. Relative warming in the upper 20 m is even stronger as wind strengthens. This is explained by slower deepening of the mixed layer and weaker entrainment cooling in the salinity-stratified case. Although the one-dimensional mixed layer model simulates warmer near-surface temperature in the salinity-stratified case, the simulated temperature stratification in the upper 10 m column doesn't exceed a few tenths of a degree in contrast with observations ( Fig. 6a) . This is explained in part by relatively short ( In winter the mixed layer model simulates a 1 o C colder mixed layer in salinity stratified case than in the control run (Fig. 7d) . The difference is due to the stably stratified halocline that limits the penetration depth of wind stirring. In turn, the shallower mixed layer cools down faster due to net surface heat loss. Although the anomalous cooling of 1 o C compares well with observations ( Fig. 6b) , the simulated mixed layer is relatively deep. Therefore, the stratification is weak in the upper 10 m in contrast to observations. This suggests again that lateral interactions (missing from the one-dimensional model) are important for establishing winter temperature inversions in the region, while the net surface heat loss further amplifies existing anomalies."}, {"section_title": "Northwestern Pacific", "text": "Salinity in the Northwestern Pacific decreases towards the surface. This stable halocline is produced by an annual-mean excess of precipitation over evaporation north of 30\u00b0N and is maintained by upward vertical pumping driven by a cyclonic wind curl [Kara et al., 2000b] .\nAlthough the regional precipitation peaks in winter, the near-surface freshening persists yearround. In summer, when the ocean heating is particularly strong (Fig. 2b) , the shallow stably stratified halocline localizes the ocean heat uptake in the near-surface layer (Fig.1) by limiting the penetration depth of wind stirring and nocturnal convection. In distinction from the Gulf Stream region, where shallow warm layers develop mostly in the cold sector of the front, the shallow warm layers are observed randomly in the Northwestern Pacific (Fig.5c ). They are not destroyed by nocturnal convection (see sample profile taken at 10 p.m. local time, Fig. 8 ).\nMeridional variations of follow the meridional variations of net surface heating and are similar if different a gradient-based definition of the mixed layer depth is used (Fig. 2d) .\nOccasional SST inversions seeing in Fig. 5c are associated with nocturnal cooling of freshwater lenses (profiles are not shown). (Fig. 5b) where the combination of strong heat loss and strong spatial gradient of salinity results in cooling of the near-surface salinity stratified layers. Despite similarly strong heat loss over the warm western boundary currents in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans (Fig. 2a) , the winter SST inversions are less frequently observed in the Kuroshio region in distinction from the Gulf Stream region (Fig.1) . This difference may be linked to the differences in spatial patterns of salinity. In fact, the spatial gradients of salinity, vital in producing the temperature anomalies, are significantly weaker in the Northwestern Pacific compared to the Northwestern Atlantic (see Fig.9 based on data from Antonov et al., 2006) . There also appears to be some evidence in Fig.1 that the >0 seen in the Gulf Stream region also occurs in the Kuroshio region southeast of Japan where the salinity gradient is stronger (Fig.9 ). This area of temperature inversions ( >0) is weaker and narrow in scope than in the Atlantic. In addition to the basin "}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "This study compares the magnitudes of two ocean temperature variables frequently used in climate studies, mixed layer temperature and bulk SST as represented by the widely used analyses of Rayner et al.

[2000a] and de Boyer Mont\u00e9gut et al. [2004] Another region where the salinity stratified barrier layers are present is the Kuroshio Extension region of the Northwest Pacific. Here the barrier layer is produced due to excess of precipitation accompanied by upward Ekman pumping preventing the vertical exchange of this freshwater. As in the case of the Gulf Stream region, the ocean gains heat in the summer at a rate exceeding 100\nWm -2 producing a warm surface layer during the day which has time averaged of -0.5 dT o C. In winter, MLT and SST match in this region.\nOne of the persistent issues in coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models is a tendency to develop cold biases in the eastern equatorial Pacific [Davey et al. 2002] . However the surface temperature of such models is actually more analogous to mixed layer temperature and (d) show temperature difference between experiment 2 and experiment 1. These two experiments have the same surface forcing, the same vertically uniform temperature initial conditions, but different salinity initial conditions.
