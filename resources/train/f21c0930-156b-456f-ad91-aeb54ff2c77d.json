[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract: This study analyzed the 8th and 10th graders' attitude towards learning science (ATLS), required cognitive skills for science examination questions (SEQ), and patterns of actual cognitive skills (ACS), in accordance with the Revised Bloom's Taxonomy (RBT) and the Piagetian Conceptual Frameworks (PCFs). The sample of the study consisted of 564 (boys and girls) 8th and 10th graders of government elementary and high schools in Sindh province of Pakistan. The RBT applied to break down the 8th graders General Science examination questions in terms of Piagetian conceptual frameworks. A Cognitive Science Achievement Test (CSAT) based on the RBT administered to measure the students' scores in science. In this study we applied causal comparative research design and stratified sampling technique for sample collection. The students' ATLS measured through Test of Science Related Attitudes (TOSRA, Fraser and Butts (1982)), whereas the existing PCFs of the students calculated by administering of the Group Assessment of Logical Thinking Test (GALT). The results showed that, the cognitive difficulty levels of SEQs found in uneven distribution at different PCFs, throughout examination questions. Most of the students were at different substages of the Concrete Operational Level (COL) and a few were at Early Formal Operational Level (EFOL), while only four students out of 564 were at Mature Formal Operational Level (MFOL). In addition, the male students scored higher on the GALT in comparison with the female students. However, there was no significant difference found between the scores of eighth and tenth graders on the GALT. The findings concluded that a gap exists between students' reasoning ability and SEQ's difficulty level, and to increase in quantity of this gap, a decrease in ATLS occurs. Curriculum developers and paper setters need to follow a model in terms of RBT and PCFs for deciding the nature, level and complexity of the questions while developing science assessment techniques for all graders."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "A continuing lower level of academic achievement of students who are studying the elementary and secondary science courses, is a cause of great concern for those who teach this course at elementary and secondary schools. While the students are not satisfied with the learning pedagogy of their teachers and they find science examination questions (SEQs) more difficult. The students' performance in this course is comparatively low among the courses at the same level with a failure rate of more than 45% during the years (Education Department, 2014 . This has led the researchers to undertake the following tasks: a) analyze the students' ATLS, b) examine the examination questions, and finally, c) investigate the students' PCFs.\nEducation improves the living conditions of a nation in two ways; first, it improves the social conditions and, second, it enhances the economic status (Hudson, 2007) , in addition, education develops intellectual maturity and forms better work force too (Nasr & Kono, 2011) . In Pakistan, the quality of education generally, and science education, particularly, is in decline (Memon, 2007) in spite of the fact that various policy makers and almost all governments have tried their level best to improve the quality of education which also includes science education. However, Shah (2010) summarizes that science education in Pakistan at elementary and secondary levels is facing new challenges. In addition, Shah (2010) is of opinion that, education generally and science education particularly, needs to be developed as per the rate of other developing countries of South East Asia. Students' achievement in science depends on many factors (Parveen, 2010; Tahir, 2007) . Teachers' teaching styles, curriculum, the examination system and the nature of the questions, students' and their parents' attitude towards science Melehat, Gezer, and Sahin (2014) , and examination results are some of the factors that may affect the students' achievement in science in two ways, first, the level (beginners, intermediate, and advance learners) of achievement and, second, the quality (poor, acceptable, and exceed expectations) of achievement (Parveen, 2010) . In examinations, mainly, the nature of the questions are incorporated Melehat et al. (2014) and as grouped in a certain manner, are those external factors that may largely affect the students' achievement in science in both ways, the level and quality of achievement (Akhtar & Shagufta, 2009) .\nIn mathematics and science, Revised Bloom's Taxonomy (RBT) has been used to prepare lesson plans with special focus on categorizing the thinking skills (Amer, 2006; Aly, 2006; Parker, Wall, & Cordery, 2001) . Similarly, the RBT has also been applied for rubric formed to assess the cognitive development of the children. In addition, RBT may also help a teacher to prepare formative questions in accordance with the adequate cognitive level of a child (Akhtar & Shagufta, 2009) , and aligns the course aims with the objectives (Aly, 2006) . Experts in science education (Anderson, 2006; Hudson, 2007; Iverach & Fisher, 2008; Khan, 2008; Oliveira, 2010; Romiro, 2015; Saad & Saouma, 2012) , advocate the multiple use of assessment of students' achievement in science at different courses of time. However, conventional assessment methods, such as annual examinations were only conveniently used to evaluate students' factual knowledge and memory (Toyin, Jamie, & Stuart, 2013) , on the other hand, the assessment of learners' conceptual framework (CFs) is more important than any other indicator. A CF is a predictive attribute that shows the level of concepts and their assimilation with other schemas in an individual's long-terms memory (Bischoff & Anderson, 2001 ). The students' CFs are generally neglected in assessing them. The assessing methods can also be categorized in terms of Piagetian Conceptual Frameworks (PCFs). The studies compared the cognitive difficulty of assessment introduced in mathematics and science tests at elementary and secondary levels and the students' current PCFs. Ron (2008) introduced the Assessment of Conceptual Development for this purpose. These studies Rader (1975) ; Gray (1978) ; Hartford and Good (1976) ; Polk and Goldstein (1980) ; Tschopp and Kurdek (1981) compared the cognitive difficulty of assessment introduced in mathematics and science tests at elementary and secondary levels and the students' current PCFs, and indicated the mismatch between cognitive difficulty of test questions, and the students' PCFs. Hartford and Good (1976); Rader (1975) ; Ron (2008) proposed four key elements necessary for constituting any evaluation test; first, concentration not just on the outcomes of the teaching, but on learners' thinking processes, second, focus on students' self-initiation for intrinsic motivation, third, learners' active participation in the learning process; and finally, a deeper stress on opportunities focused on developing learner's thinking and intellectual maturity and focus on students' different backgrounds in the developmental process. (Tahir, 2007) revealed that assessment is based more on the memorization of texts in Pakistan than in any other educational or cultural setting. There is a need of modification of their national assessment approaches and techniques in accordance with learners'-centered approach. Bird (2010) and Elsa (2011) argue that if misalignment exists between SEQs and students' PCFs, it may hinder students' abstract reasoning and other higher order thinking skills too. This gap also negatively affects (Kelvin, 2001; Matusov, 2001 ) students' selfconfidence and in turn destroys the students' ATLS, and as a result, their cognitive skills cannot develop in accordance with the age-stage model of (Piaget, 1970) . A host of researches indicated that most of the elementary and upper elementary students reach the concrete operational stage (Rima, 2014) , however, according to Piaget's age-stage model the students of elementary school must reach at the FOL (Barbara & Tambra, 2008; Campbell, 2006; Gwendolyn, 2010; Nasr & Kono, 2011) One of the most important reasons of students' poor performance in science subjects can be traced back to the evidence that Pakistan is one of those countries where assessment, testing, and evaluation get low priority in the field of learning, especially, the quality of learning in science and technology fields (Akhtar & Shagufta, 2009 ). According to Radmehr (2010) , annual SEQs often fail to assess Higher Order Cognitive Skills, on the contrary, they promote rote learning (Khan, 2008) . Indeed, in Pakistan, the standardized evaluation methods and assessment tests are rarely applied in science subjects at elementary and secondary levels (Memon, 2007; Tahir, 2007) . In the same way, the teacher prepares tests by him/herself without adopting/adapting any taxonomy of educational objectives, or Piagetian developmental model. Hence, the teacher-made tests cannot gauge (Mahmoud, 2014 ) the proper cognitive skills of a child. Therefore, they need to develop an evaluation and testing tool that can measure the intellectual skills of school children properly (Akhtar & Shagufta, 2009 )."}, {"section_title": "Literature Review Science Examination Questions (SEQs)", "text": "Meta-analysis of the achievement in science on SEQs shows (Rima, 2014) that Pakistani eighth graders performed poorly on questions which demand abstract thinking and operational reasoning, conceptual and procedural understanding, analyzing the phenomenon and creating solutions for a difficult problem. In the same way, Shah (2010) found a mismatch between students' achievement in science and cognitive demands of science curriculum at elementary and secondary schools in Pakistan. In another study, the cognitive and knowledge process dimensions of the RBT properly show this limitation of the science course SEQs (Talat, Abro, & Jamali, 2013) . The presence of gradual increase in cognitive difficulty of SEQs, makes students ready to think on their own, find solutions to the problems in a cooperative manner including the attainment of science knowledge by reflective practices."}, {"section_title": "Piaget's Conceptual Frameworks (PCFs)", "text": "Due to the rapid development of cognitive psychology (Yusuf, Avsar, Yavuz, Uygun, & Ozdil, 2013) , the understanding of the students' hypothetical reasoning, metacognitive abilities, and abstract thinking skills have become critical for addressing the issues related to the quality of science education. Therefore, appropriate intellectual maturity is the most important aim of science education, as well as different learning models and assessment tools applied for gauging the cognitive skills of the learners (Yusuf et al., 2013) . The PCFs are mental processes which indicate students' understanding levels of abstract and concrete concepts, such as, thinking at lower and higher levels, reflective practices, and perceptions (Nasr & Kono, 2011; Khan, 2008; Kousar, 2009) . Similarly, the environmental factors such as, the learning environment of the school, over-stress on completion of course material, preparing students for qualifying in annual examinations (Yusuf et al., 2013) , and finally, over emphasis on answering the SEQs instead of developing adequate PCFs of learners hinder the proper conceptual development of the students in elementary and secondary schools (Bush, Daddysman, & Charnigo, 2014) . Lower rates of PCFs can affect the students' ATLS negatively (Yusuf et al., 2013) ."}, {"section_title": "Misalignment between Different Cognitive Levels and Types of Science Exam Questions", "text": "A gap between students' PCFs and the types of questions asked in the examinations, influence the elementary school students' ATLS (DeAvila & Pulos, 1979; De Lisi, 1979; Hartford & Good, 1976) . Therefore, in either case of too easy or too difficult SEQs (Rima, 2014) discourage the students from active participation and meaningful learning (Egan & Judson, 2009; Elsa, 2011) . Experts in science education (Anderson, 2006; Romiro, 2015; Saad & Saouma, 2012) advocate the multiple use of assessment of students' achievement in science at different courses of time. However, conventional assessment methods, such as annual examinations were only conveniently used to evaluate students' factual knowledge and memory, on the other hand, the assessment of learners' CFs, is more important than any other indicator. The RBT not only allows a teacher to assess his/her students' existing cognitive levels, but helps the students to increase their higher order thinking skills too (Husna & Faridah, 2012) . The hierarchy of the RBT can be applied to curriculum development, improving the classroom situation, assessment (Forehand, 2005; Huitt, 2009 ) and evaluation, proper cognitive development (Crowe, Dirks, & Wenderoth, 2008) , and provides the teacher with classified questions (Aly, 2006; Eber & Parker, 2007) categorized at six levels of cognitive development. The RBT consists of two dimensions; first the cognitive process dimension, and second, the knowledge process dimension. The first cognitive process dimension includes six levels; 1) remembering, 2) understanding, 3) applying, 4) analyzing, 5) evaluating, and 6) creating Anderson (2006) , while, the knowledge process dimension has four levels; 1) factual, 2) conceptual, 3) procedural and 4) metacognitive."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of SEQs According to the RBT", "text": "As mentioned in foregoing paragraphs, the questions at certain levels of the cognitive dimension of the RBT can improve the cognitive skills of the students; these questions in a hierarchy can also enhance the achievement of students as well. Literature on the \"types of questions asked\" concludes that the use of questioning strategies by instructors has a major impact on the quality and quantity of student achievement in science (Winne, 1979) . In another study, (Ron, 2008) found that the types of questions asked during exam, especially, when higher order thinking questions are used, increased the students' science achievement. Research on the types of questions asked focuses either on the instructor's ability to ask higher order questions or offers the learning in question development for instruction and assessment, is deeply needed (Reeves, 1990) .\nThe presence of gradual increase in cognitive difficulty of SEQs, make students ready to think on their own, to find solutions to the problems in a cooperative manner, including the attainment of science knowledge by reflective practices (Andre, 1979; Usha & Murthy, 2011) . According to Egan and Judson (2009) , school graders are directly related to PCFs, generally, age and intellectual maturity increase with an increase in a graders level, which in turn improves the reasoning ability of an individual, whereas only one research was available indicating the effect of locality on PCFs of the students (Shah, 2010) .\nOn concluding the foregoing sections, it can be said that students generally differ with each other in their thinking skills and performances. Their thinking skills have direct association with their cognitive developmental levels. These cognitive developmental levels are generally explored with the use of PCFs."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "It is assumed that the misalignment if exists between the unevenness of cognitive difficulty of SEQs and students' current PCFs, may negatively affect students' learning and ATLS. To analyze this misalignment, the data collection and analysis was broken down into five major steps. The first step involved analyzing the SEQs of eighth and tenth graderss in terms of cognitive levels by applying the RBT, and PCFs by applying Group Assessment Logical Thinking Test (GALT). Next the PCFs of eighth and tenth graders were determined, after which the eighth and tenth graders students' ATLS were evaluated. The last step included exploring the effects of this gap between students' existing PCFs and the cognitive difficulty of SEQs on the ATLS of eighth and tenth graders.\nAll male and female science students in eighth and tenth grades from rural and urban elementary and high schools of the Sindh province were the population of the study. This study used a multistage convenience sampling techniques; in the first stage of sampling, two districts (i.e., Sukkur and Khairpur selected for accessibility to data and the suitability of the sample for the purpose of the study) out of 23 districts of province Sindh were selected on the basis of the sample situated spatially and administratively near the area where the researcher conducted the data collection and the members of the population were homogenous.

Therefore, in Pakistani context, there is a need of such type of studies at large scale.
