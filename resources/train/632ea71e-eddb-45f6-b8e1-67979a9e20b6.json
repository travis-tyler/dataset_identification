[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objectives: Development of a state-wide comprehensive surveillance system for non-fatal workrelated farm injuries, since non-fatal injuries that occur to the self-employed (i.e., many farm owners/operators), family workers, federal government workers and small farms with fewer than 11 employees are not included in the Bureau of Labor Statistics employer-based survey used to produce the U.S. National statistics of work-related injuries. Methods: In 2015 and 2016, inpatient discharge summaries, emergency department, and hospital-based outpatient clinic records from all 134 of Michigan's hospitals with ICD-9 codes 989.0-.1, E827.0-.9, E849.1, E906.8, E919.0 or ICD-10 codesT65.0-.1, V80, Y92.7, W55.1-.4, W30 were reviewed to identify non-fatal work-related farm injuries. Results: We identified 1,559 non-fatal work-related farm injury incidents that occurred in 1,525 individuals, with 74% being among men. The most common parts of the body injured were an upper limb (38.2%) and a lower limb (23.7%). The most common types of injury were contusions (26.4%) and fractures (19.9%). Owners/operators accounted for 44.1% and hired hands for 42.9% of individuals injured. Injuries caused by cows were the predominant cause: 472 (31.5%) of all the injuries. Dairy farms accounted for 39.6% of all cases for which the farm type was recorded. Conclusion: A comprehensive system to identify non-fatal work-related farm injuries among all individuals who work on a farm, including owner/operators, family members and migrant and seasonal farm laborers, was implemented using hospital, emergency department and hospital-based outpatient clinic medical records. Such a system is important to be able to identify hazards and target prevention."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The agriculture industry is one of the most hazardous industries, where farm operators and workers have a high rate of farm-related fatalities. 1 In addition, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the official source of work-related injury statistics, estimated nationwide in 2015 there were 37,400 workrelated agricultural injuries (excluding injuries in Forestry, Fishing and Hunting), an incidence rate of 6.1 per 100 full-time equivalents (FTEs). 2 There were 22,800 of the injuries that led to days away from work, job transfer or restriction-an incidence rate of 3.7/100 FTEs. In 2016, BLS estimated there were 34,400 (5.8 per 100 FTEs) farm-related work injuries of which 19,000 (3.2 per 100,000 FTEs) had days away from work, job transfer or restriction. 2 For Michigan in 2015, BLS estimated there were 1,000 (5.2 per 100 FTEs) work-related agricultural injuries, of which 500 (2.6 per 100 FTEs) had days away from work, job transfer, or restriction, and there were 700 (4.1 per 100 FTEs) in 2016, of which 500 (2.8 per 100 FTEs) had days away from work, job transfer, or restriction. 3 In contrast to the BLS surveillance system for fatal work-related injuries (Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries [CFOI] ), which uses multiplesources and includes all individuals in the agricultural sector regardless of their work status and number of employees, the BLS estimates for non-fatal injuries are based on employer reporting through the Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses (SOII). 4 The BLS non-fatal injury estimate has substantial limitations and does not present a true estimate of agricultural injuries, missing about 77.6% of occupational injuries and illnesses in agriculture. 5 The BLS estimate for agriculture does not include self-employed owner/operators, family workers, federal government employees, or farms with fewer than 11 employees. In Michigan, an estimated 3% of farms are large farms (10+ employees) which employ 60% of farm workers in the state. 6 Several national studies and surveys have reported the health and safety hazards and measured the magnitude and characteristics of agricultural injuries in specific geographic areas or populations. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] A few international retrospective studies analyzed farming injuries treated in emergency departments. 16, 17 In 2015, Michigan initiated surveillance for non-fatal work-related farm injuries, adding farm injuries to existing multi-source surveillance for non-fatal work-related amputations, crushing injuries, burns, skull fractures, and hospitalized injuries. 18 Michigan's surveillance system tracks all work-related farm injuries, irrespective of the number of farm workers on the farm, the individual's age, or whether selfemployed or family worker that are treated at Michigan's hospitals, emergency departments or hospital-based outpatient clinics.

The first incidence rate utilized the number of operators, hired farm labor, unpaid workers and migrant/seasonal laborers; the second incidence rate was based on a smaller denominator because it assumed that both hired farm labor and migrant/ seasonal laborers were included in the hired hand category. Rates were presented as a range using these two denominators, 217,552 and 266,687, respectively. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture 2012 Census of Agriculture for Michigan, there were 52,194 farms in Michigan with 80,304 operators, 83,451 hired farm labor, 53,797 unpaid workers and 49,135 migrant and seasonal laborers. 6 Farm operators are people who own or control the operations on the farm and are usually self-employed. Hired labor includes paid family members, bookkeepers, office workers, maintenance workers, etc., if their work was primarily associated with agricultural production. Hired farm workers excluded contract (migrant) workers and operators identified as a hired manager. The Census divides hired farm workers into two categories based on the duration of work in a calendar year: working 150 days or more (25,710 workers) or less than 150 days (57,741 workers). Unpaid workers include agricultural workers not on the payroll who perform activities or work on a farm or ranch (family members). The number of migrant workers was not noted on the 2012 Agricultural Census, only the number of farms utilizing migrant labor.

The company had not corrected the hazard at the time of the inspection, which was performed six months after the injury."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Michigan's farm-related injury surveillance system identified 1,559 non-fatal work-related farm injuries in 1,525 individuals over a 2-year period. These nonfatal injuries were in addition to 49 agricultural fatalities (21 in 2015 and 28 in 2016) identified during the same time period in a separate system by the Michigan Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (MIFACE) Program. 26 Given the exclusions of the BLS employer-based system, we were surprised that the BLS estimate of 1,700 farm injuries for Michigan during this same time period was greater than the number of injuries identified in our medical record based system. In all the other conditions we have under surveillance, the BLS estimates were only 30-40% of what was identified in medical records. 27 Why this is different for farmrelated injuries may be based on where farmers seek care, primary care offices, migrant health clinics or urgent care facilities -facilities that were not included in the Michigan surveillance system. Similar to other reports, farm injuries in male workers were the most common in Michigan  (1,131; (28.2%) . Sources of the injury data and the time frame the data were collected varied in previous studies. The Iowa agricultural data were derived from the Iowa Trauma Registry, which is a data repository managed by the Iowa Department of Health of reports from acute care hospitals accredited as Level I, II, and III Trauma Care Facilities (2005-2013). 13 The Maine agricultural and logging data were derived from administrative data for ambulance runs and hospitalizations and did not distinguish work and non-work related injuries (2008).\n14 The Minnesota data were derived from an administrative hospital discharge database and did not distinguish work and non-work related injuries (2000-2011). 15 We found that the use of administrative data without the review of medical records would lead to a 65% over count. The Swiss data were derived from patients admitted to the only Level I ED center in a mainly rural and agricultural catchment area in Switzerland (2000-2011) , 15 and the Polish data were from agricultural and forestry related injury cases admitted to an ED of a single hospital (2004) (2005) . 17 The sources for the other data were populationbased cross-sectional surveys; farmers listed in the Alabama Agricultural Statistics Service (AASS) maintained and used by U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) (1990-1991); 7 a mailed and telephone interview of farm operators selected from the USDA list of all farms in Otsego County, New York (1984-1986); 10 a survey using the National Safety Council Farm Accident Survey forms and sampling strategy (1978); 11 and a personal interview with a representative from each participating farm identified by the Agricultural Census Division of Statistics Canada (1986). 12 None of these reports involved development of an ongoing system, and all the surveys depended on the farmer's participation in an interview and self-reports of the injury. These surveys contrast with our ongoing statewide system, which uses medical records of individuals treated in hospitals across the state, includes all individuals working on farms, and is not dependent on participation rates nor self-reporting by individuals. However, one advantage of the surveys is that they capture injuries that either the farmer did not seek treatment for or treatment was provided in a non-hospital based setting.\nIn contrast to farm-related work fatalities, which are predominately machine related (i.e., tractors), livestock were the most common source of nonfatal injuries in Michigan. Differences like these reinforce the need for a comprehensive surveillance system that can identify both fatal and non-fatal farm injuries.\nIn 2015, the rate of farm-related injury was 2.53-3.11 per 100 workers, and in 2016 it was 3.3-4.05 per 100 workers. We have presented the rate as a range, because of uncertainty about the denominator and whether or not migrant/seasonal laborers are included or not as a separate category of farm labor. 4 BLS reported that the non-fatal farm-related injury rate in Michigan in 2015 was 5.2 per 100 FTEs and 4.1 per 100 FTEs in 2016. 3 The BLS rates were higher in 2015 but not in 2016. Differences between the rates we calculated and those calculated by BLS are partially because BLS calculates FTEs while our denominator is the number of workers. We attribute the higher rate in 2015 to not only having more injuries reported to BLS despite the exclusions of the SOII and that BLS used a smaller denominator with the same exclusions as in the numerator to calculate the rates. The lower BLS rate in 2016 is unexplained. Variations in the relatively small number of employer reports, which are then extrapolated to derive the BLS estimate, may be the explanation, and further years of data are needed to explain the variation. This can also be true for our hospital/ED data, where the number of injuries increased from 677 in 2015 to 882 in 2016. The higher BLS estimate suggests that at least for 2015, injuries were recorded as work-related by employers and either were not treated in hospitals/EDs or were not recognized by health care providers in hospitals/ EDs as being work-related.\nBLS reported 680 (390 in 2015 and 290 in 2016) non-fatal work-related farm injuries involving days away from work by selected worker and case characteristics for Michigan. 23, 24 Farm injuries of upper extremities were the most common location both in the BLS data set (240; 35.5%) and in the Michigan surveillance system (595; 38.2%). BLS only collects information on the type of injury for the days away from work cases. Injuries in the BLS system that involve days away from work are likely to be the more severe injuries that are treated in hospitals/EDs, and this is likely to be the explanation why the predominate injury types in the BLS system were similar to the type of injuries reported in our surveillance system. Most farm injuries occurred in farm operators and workers in the 25-34 age group, both in BLS and Michigan surveillance, with 320 (47.1%) and 285 (18.7%), respectively.\nA surveillance system based on workers' compensation data would markedly undercount farm injuries. Workers' compensation insurance was identified in the medical records as the payer for only 24.2% of the work-related farm injuries treated at Michigan hospital/ED or hospital-based outpatient clinic. The workers' compensation database identified only 78 (5.0%) of the 1,559 work-related farm injuries identified in our review of medical records. There are different reasons why relying on workers' compensation for farm-related injuries is not sufficient. First in Michigan, the workers' compensation database only included farm injuries that caused 7 or more consecutive days away from work, presumably the most severe cases. Second, WCA, similarly to the BLS, excluded the self-employed (Michigan's surveillance identified 523 owner/operators) and family members (Michigan's surveillance identified 138 family members). Furthermore, in Michigan, agricultural employers, if they employ fewer than 3 employees, do not have to carry workers' compensation coverage. Finally, it is possible that some companies handle farm injuries unofficially and do not report them to workers' compensation insurance companies or the WCA. 28 Michigan surveillance greatly expands the scope of farm injuries identified as compared to previous state studies. 5, [7] [8] [9] [12] [13] [14] [15] The use of Michigan's hospital, ED, and hospital-based outpatient clinic records have been very effective in providing a more accurate count of work-related farm injuries on all individuals irrespective of their age, occupation status, farm type, or severity of the injury. Michigan surveillance using medical records includes all individuals working on a farm, including categories of workers that are excluded by both BLS and WCA in their statistics, self-employed farm owners/operators, family workers, federal employees, and additionally excluded by BLS farm workers who work on farms with fewer than 11 employees. Similar, to the BLS and Workers' Compensation exclusion of certain categories of farm workers, most state studies do not provide injury information on all farm operators and workers or all farming types in specific states. Most studies do not include individuals other than farm operators 7, 10 or who do not work or live year-round on the farm, children, seasonal, and migrant workers. 9 Some state-based studies focused only on specific farming types, like dairy 8 or beef and dairy. 12 Some state-based studies focused only on more severe non-fatal agricultural injuries. 9, 13, 15 However, two international studies, 16, 17 based on an analysis of all emergency department medical records, show more similarities to the design and scope of the Michigan's surveillance than the states' survey-based studies.\nThe Michigan surveillance system for farm injuries does have limitations. First, the information available from medical records varied. Therefore, information on race and ethnicity, injury source, category of worker, farm type, or source of payment was often missing or incomplete. Second, if individuals who sustained a work-related farm injury while working in Michigan were treated by their own personal doctor, in an urgent care, migrant health clinic, or in a medical facility out of state, that injury would have been missed. Some hospitals may have miscoded diagnoses as not being work-or farm-related, and those would have been missed. Costs of farm injuries were not available from medical records. The data available on the costs of occupational injuries in agriculture in the United States estimate the direct costs to be $1.66 billion and the indirect costs to be $2.93 billion. 29 "}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Surveillance of all farm-related fatalities in the BLS CFOI surveillance system that does not exclude important components of the farming community such as the self-employed farm owner/operator, family workers, and workers from farms with fewer than 11 employees has become important for targeting the causes of fatalities, such as tractor rollovers, and multiple intervention programs. Similarly, surveillance of work-related non-fatal farm injuries is crucial to the recognition and prevention of these conditions. An advantage of the Michigan surveillance system is that it not only provides a reliable count of the total number of non-fatal work-related farm injuries requiring hospitalization, an emergency department visit, or a hospital-based outpatient visit, but it also provides more detailed information about the farmrelated injuries than provided in the BLS SOII. The Michigan system can be used to identify specific farms to perform follow-up investigations. The investigation completed at one farm identified a major correctible problem. The data derived are useful for educational material. For example, we have developed a hazard alert for the safe handling of animals in response to identifying animals, particularly dairy cows, as being the most common cause of injury. 30 We plan to continue to collect data on non-fatal work-related farm injuries, because such surveillance is crucial to the targeting and evaluation of programs to prevent these conditions. This study is the first compilation of data on non-fatal workrelated farm injuries in Michigan, and the number and distribution of non-fatal work-related farm injuries may differ in subsequent years."}]
