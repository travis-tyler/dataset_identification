This study investigated the comparability of educational attainment with reading level and examined whether discrepancies in education and reading level accounted for differences in neuropsychological test performance between HIV1 racial0ethnic minority and nonminority participants. Study participants (N 5 200) were derived from the Manhattan HIV Brain Bank (MHBB) where 50% of the cohort had \u05458th grade reading level but only 5% had \u05458 years of education. Significantly lower reading ability and education was found among African Americans and Hispanics, and these participants were more likely to have discrepant reading and education levels compared to non-Hispanic Whites. Discrepancy in reading and education level was associated with worse neuropsychological performance while racial0ethnic minority status was not. As years of schooling overestimated racial0ethnic minority participants' educational quality, standard norms based on education may inflate impairment rates among racial0ethnic minorities. Identifying appropriate normative standards is and will continue to be important in the detection of cognitive impairment in racial0ethnic minorities with HIV. (JINS, 2005, 11, 889-898.) "}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Racial0ethnic differences in neuropsychological test performance are widely observed Jacobs et al., 1997 Tang et al., 2001 ) and without appropriate normative corrections, the potential to misclassify racial0ethnic minorities as having cognitive dysfunction exists (Adams et al., 1982; Manly et al., 1998b; Heaton et al., 2001 ). Racial0 ethnic minorities tend to have lower education levels and lower socioeconomic status than non-Hispanic Whites, but even when groups are matched for education and socioeconomic status African Americans tend to have lower scores on verbal and nonverbal tests (Stern et al., 1992; Welsh et al., 1995; Manly et al., 1998a Manly et al., , 1998b Manly et al., , 2002 . Recent research has revealed that matching racial0ethnic groups for years of education is ineffective because it falsely assumes equivalent educational quality among different ethnic0 racial groups. For instance, among African American elders, years of schooling are an inadequate measure of educational quality because their reading skills tend to be below their educational level (Baker et al., 1996; Albert & Teresi, 1999; Manly et al., 2002) .\nAccurate interpretation of ethnic0racial minorities' test performance is an extremely important issue in contemporary neuropsychology because of the historical neglect of these groups and our increasingly diverse multicultural soci-ety. The appreciation of our cultural diversity has facilitated investigating the utility of ethnically diverse normative samples. It has also led to studying variables that are proxies for ethnicity but are more precisely related to culture, education, and access. Comparing the performance of racial0 ethnic minorities to demographically similar groups has led to decreases in misclassification rates (Lucas et al., 1998; Norman et al., 2000; Heaton et al., 2001; Patton et al., 2003) , which is a primary benefit of norms that account for ethnicity (Manly, 2005) .\nRecently, the utility of ethnic0racial categories as an explanatory construct in behavioral science research has been questioned because these categories lack consensual scientific meaning in psychology (Helms et al., 2005) . Replacing racial categories with conceptual constructs has been recommended. This recommendation parallels investigations of educational quality and access, factors that can differ by race0ethnicity but are due to sociopolitical forces and not endemic to race. For example, reading ability is associated with academic achievement (Wilkinson, 1993) as well as educational resources (i.e., teacher training, school district spending on students, and student0teacher ratio) (Hedges et al., 1994) . Reading ability has been shown to be a proxy for educational quality that attenuates racial0ethnic differences in neuropsychological test performance in an elderly cohort (Manly et al., 2002) . Thus, reading ability may be a more meaningful variable than years of education in the assessment of racial0ethnic minorities and interpretation of their performance.\nIdentifying superior assessment methods is especially important in neurodegenerative research where the primary objective is the detection of disease-related cognitive deficits and thus, diagnostic accuracy is paramount. The HIV epidemic disproportionately affects African Americans and Hispanics (CDC, 2003) . There have been a few studies reporting that HIV1 African Americans tend to have lower neuropsychological scores than HIV1 non-Hispanic Whites (Miller et al., 1997; Manly et al., 1998a) and Hispanics (Richardson et al., 2002) . However, HIV1 and HIV2 African Americans' scores do not differ from each other until an AIDS diagnosis (Mason et al., 1998) . Understanding how best to measure neurocognitive abilities in racial0ethnic minorities will help elucidate the prevalence of HIV-related neuropsychological impairment in these groups and minimize potential confounds in the interpretation of impaired scores due to measurement error. While HIV infection can occur throughout the lifespan, the majority of infected individuals are ages 35-44 (CDC, 2003) . Previous work assessing the contribution of reading to neuropsychological performance in racial0ethnic minorities has been conducted with elderly cohorts (Manly et al., 2002 (Manly et al., , 2003 , thus, whether these results generalize to younger cohorts is unknown.\nUsing a cross-sectional design, the present study examined the utility of reading ability as a proxy for education in a middle-aged cohort. We investigated the magnitude of discrepancies in years of education versus reading grade level among a predominantly racial0ethnic minority cohort with advanced HIV disease. Using published norms we compared rates of neuropsychological impairment based on education-corrected and reading-grade-adjusted normative data. For education-corrected normative data, participants' reported education levels were used. For reading-gradeadjusted normative data, we substituted participants' readinggrade levels for their education. We tested the hypothesis that a discrepancy in reading level versus years of education and not ethnicity0race would account for differences in neuropsychological test performance among a diverse cohort."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Research Participants", "text": "Two hundred study participants were derived from the Manhattan HIV Brain Bank (MHBB), a longitudinal observational study that includes biannual neurologic, neuropsychologic, and psychiatric examinations.

Participants were excluded from this study analysis if they had dyslexia or another condition (i.e., blindness) that confounded or prevented their reading. The present analyses utilized baseline data.\nFurther MHBB participation eligibility criteria include: (1) presence of a condition indicative of advanced HIV without effective therapy, or (2) a CD4 count \u0545 50 cells0 mm 3 for at least a 3-month period of time or (3) substantive risk for imminent mortality in the judgment of the participant's primary physician. Indicator conditions for criterion 1 are progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, systemic or CNS lymphoma, disseminated mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, wasting (.30% lean body mass), AIDS Dementia Complex, CMV end organ disease, visceral Kaposi's sarcoma, congestive heart failure, hemoglobin less than 10 mg0dl, or serum albumin ,3.2 g0dl.\nTwo hundred participants (73% male) were studied. Of these, 51% of the participants were African American, 24% Hispanic, and 25% non-Hispanic White. Mean age was 44.4 years (SD 5 7.5). Median CD4 count was 122 cells0mm 3 and median log plasma HIV RNA was 3.9736 copies0mL.

Participants were asked to pronounce words and if they were unable to correctly pronounce ten consecutive words, to name letters. Words are listed in order of decreasing familiarity and increasing phonological complexity. Grade equivalent scores were derived by age-based normative values from the WRAT-3 manual. The WRAT-3 reading grades were quantified from prekindergarten through 8th grade. Beyond an 8th grade reading level, participants were assigned either \"high school\" or \"post high school\" reading levels. These qualitative descriptors were used because test development revealed little variance within the high school or within the post high school reading levels (G. Wilkinson, personal communication, November, 2003) . Thus, we assigned any par-890 E.L. Ryan ticipant with a \"high school\" reading ability a 12th grade reading level and participants with a \"post high school\" reading level were arbitrarily assigned 13 years. We classified participants into two groups by comparing their education level and reading grade. In the first group, reading grade and education were either equivalent or within 1 year. This Reading0Education Equivalent Group included participants whose reading and education were equivalent by grade level. For instance, it included participants with a 9th grade education and 12th grade reading level, as these are both at the high school grade level. Similarly, participants with 16 years education and a college reading level who were arbitrarily assigned 13 years were classified in this group. The second group was comprised of participants whose reading grade score was at least two years less than their education level (Reading0Education Discrepant). This group included participants who had a college education but a high school reading level.\nGiven that a \u0546 2 year discrepancy in education level versus reading grade would lead to a participant's stated years of education potentially overestimating the quality of education he or she received, the Reading0Education Discrepant group was the primary interest of our study and as such we subjected this group to further analyses.

Reading0 "}, {"section_title": "Neuropsychological impairment in minorities with HIV", "text": "education discrepancies accounted for lower performance in all of the neuropsychological domains, whereas racial0 ethnic minority status did not. Reading0education discrepancies had a stronger relationship with neuropsychological functioning than race0ethnicity, indicating the importance of educational quality in understanding racial0ethnic minorities' test performance. This study is the first to investigate the roles of low literacy and race0ethnicity in neuropsychological test performance among an advanced-HIV1 cohort. Given that the epidemic has transited to a greater racial0ethnic minority population, it is essential to identify whether or not differences in neuropsychological test performance are due to HIV or other factors unrelated to the disease process, so as to avoid inappropriate classifications of neuropsychological impairment and resulting erroneous interpretations of an HIV effect. There have been a few reports documenting that HIV1 African Americans obtain lower scores on neuropsychological tests (Manly et al., 1998a; Miller et al., 1997; Richardson et al., 2002) . Accounting for acculturation and applying norms developed for African Americans reduced racial0ethnic discrepancies in scores among HIV1 African Americans (Miller et al., 1997; Manly et al., 1998a) . Our findings add to these studies by suggesting that educational quality, which can differ by race0ethnicity, may also be a worthwhile explanatory construct in understanding neuropsychological performance among African American and Hispanic HIV1 individuals.\nLiteracy is an important factor in the assessment and interpretation of cognitive functioning among racial0ethnic minority groups. There is a growing body of literature documenting that African Americans have reading levels below their completed years of education (Baker et al., 1996; Manly et al., 1998a; Albert & Teresi, 1999) and that racial0ethnic differences in cognitive testing are diminished after adjusting for literacy (Manly et al., 2002; Mehta et al., 2004) . Results from the National Adult Literacy Survey (NALS) indicate that 21% of adults perform at the lowest level of literacy and that racial0ethnic minorities are over-represented at the lowest literacy levels due to differences in average education level and socioeconomic status (Kirsch et al., 2002) . NALS findings reveal that even after controlling for education, differences in literacy among ethnic groups persist. Our results also demonstrate that after accounting for Fig. 3 . Impairment rates by race0ethnicity in Reading0Education Discrepant Group based on reading-based norms. education, significant differences in reading level persisted across the three racial0ethnicity groups. In our study, socioeconomic status (SES), as measured by median income per zip code, did not appreciably account for the relationship between education and reading across different racial0 ethnic groups. The weaker relationship between reading and education in African American (r 5 .53) and Hispanic (r 5 .58) as opposed to non-Hispanic White (r 5 .67) participants adds further evidence that these two variables may function differently in African Americans (Manly et al., 2002) and Hispanics. Whether quality of education among African Americans and Hispanics can be better accounted for by measuring psychosocial and cultural factors such as acculturation, parental involvement in school, parental level of education, parental assistance with homework, availability of textbooks and school supplies, involvement in after school activities, and so forth, is a topic for further investigation (Byrd et al., in press ). Fifty percent of the African Americans and Hispanics in the MHBB cohort had reading levels that were less than their years of education. Notably, this proportion is higher than in Manly et al.'s (2002) sample where one-third of African Americans had reading levels lower than their years of education. The MHBB rates of reading0education discrepancy are even more striking when one considers that reading0education discrepancies were defined as within a two-year difference, whereas Manley et al. used the more lenient criterion of a one-year difference. It is also important to note that MHBB participants were much younger (mean age of African American participants was 44.8 years) than a previously examined sample (mean age of African American participants was 73.9 years; Manly et al., 2002) . While prior investigators attributed the vast educational discrepancies to the segregated southern school systems in which African American elders were educated, our replication and expansion of this pattern in a younger cohort highlights the continued disparity in the quality of education for racial0ethnic minorities.\nThe present study is an exploratory investigation of the differential level of impairment using norms based on years of schooling versus reading grade level. Using reading grade as a proxy for years of education significantly lowered the rates of impairment; the percentage of impairment decreased from 0.8% to 29.4% across all tests. While rates of impairment decreased using reading-grade level, it remains uncertain what the actual rate of impairment is or whether using reading-grade level in place of education is a valid method of norming tests. A limitation of this study is the absence of additional indicators of impairment with which to compare our education and reading-grade norms. Similarly, the lack of published norms for individuals with low education levels is also a limitation. While no participants had education levels lower then the lowest education level available in the norms used in this study, 51 participants in the Reading0 Education Discrepant group had reading levels lower than the lowest education level available in the norms. Using published norms above these individuals' reading levels may have overestimated impairment in this group and is a limitation of the current study. An additional limitation is the multiple comparisons without correction that we undertook given the exploratory nature of this study.\nFurther research to investigate the optimal norming procedure to use with racial0ethnic minorities is needed. Our data revealed a differential effect of using reading-based norms across the racial0ethnic groups. For instance, half of Hispanics in the Reading0Education Discrepant group were impaired on FAS using education norms, whereas with reading-grade norms, one quarter were impaired. African Americans had a similar reduction in impairment rate for TMT-B after applying reading-based norms. The recent availability of demographically corrected norms that adjust for race0ethnicity has improved the historic lack of racial0 ethnic minority representation in normative studies and is likely to improve the diagnostic accuracy of neuropsychological evaluations. For example, applying norms developed for African Americans reduced the percentage of impairment in HIV1 African American men from 71% to 44%, which was closer to the 38% impairment rate of the study's non-Hispanic White males (Miller et al., 1997) . Whether the best approach is to use racial0ethnic group norms that adjust for education, to use reading-grade-level based norms, to account for acculturation (Ardilia et al., 1989; Helms, 1997; Manly et al., 1998a Manly et al., , 2002 Kennepohl et al., 2004) , some combination of these factors, or even some additional variable is uncertain. However, a recent study found that among elder African Americans, educational quality (as measured by reading level) was a more influential predictor of neuropsychological performance than acculturation (Manly et al., 2004) .\nIn our analyses of individual tests using norms based on participant's reading-grade level, half of the tests we administered, FAS, PASAT, and the WAIS-III subtests (Digit Symbol, Letter Number Sequencing, and Symbol Search) used racial0ethnic corrections. Yet significant differences in impairment levels remained when norms were based on education versus reading-grade level both for these tests as well as those that did not have ethnicity corrections (TMT-A, TMT-B, GPDH, GPNH, and WCST). The range of neuropsychological impairment using education-based norms was lower for non-race0ethnicity adjusted than the race0ethnicity adjusted tests (35.7%-59.8% vs. 15.2%-45.5%). Whereas for tests normed using reading-grade level, the non-race0 ethnicity adjusted tests had a range of impairment (23.2%-56.3%) that was higher than for the tests adjusted for race0 ethnicity (8.1%-29.4%). This likely reflects the fact that two of the non-ethnicity corrected tests, GP and TMT, did not have educational norms appropriate for our lowest literacy participants.\nAmong participants with reading levels less than their education (Reading0Education Discrepant group), the magnitude of difference in impairment rates between education versus reading norms was the greatest for Digit Symbol (44.5% vs. 16.1%), which is intuitive given that reading also requires associative learning skills. TMT-B also showed a large difference in impairment rates using the two norming methods (45.54% vs. 23.2%), which suggests that the speeded alphanumeric shifting in TMT-B may be more difficult for individuals with poorer reading skills. Although 37% of Group 3 participants made errors in alphabet writing, their errors tended to be in the last third of the alphabet. Thus, writing the letters \"A through J\" and knowing the consecutive order as required by TMT-B did not appear to contribute to the differences in TMT-B impairment rates using the two norming methods. However, for these participants, knowledge of the alphabet is likely less automatic and over-learned than in participants who could write the alphabet flawlessly. Future investigation of the relationship between alphabet writing and TMT-B performance is warranted, as is comparing TMT-B performance and the Color Trails Test (D'Elia & Satz, 1996) in individuals with difficulty correctly writing the alphabet and0or low reading scores.\nLow education level is a risk factor for neuropsychological impairment in HIV (Satz et al., 1993; Stern et al., 1996; Da Ronchi et al., 2002) . Recently, among HIV1 gay and bisexual men IQ has been found to be a superior marker of cognitive reserve compared to education (Farinpour et al., 2003) , suggesting that IQ is a better indicator of native cognitive ability. Among racial0ethnic minority elders, literacy (not education) was the most sensitive predictor of memory decline (Manly et al., 2003) . Whether literacy is a robust predictor of cognitive reserve in HIV1 racial0ethnic minorities remains to be seen. In our sample with 56% of participants having reading levels lower than their education, it is likely that literacy is a better measure of native ability and a more sensitive marker of cognitive reserve. Longitudinal studies of HIV-related neurocognitive impairment in low literacy individuals would also help increase understanding of the utility of literacy as a marker of cognitive reserve. Also, functional neuroimaging studies of high and low literate HIV1 participants would help determine whether there is differential recruitment of brain networks during cognitive processing, and thus provide in vivo information about literacy's contribution to cognitive reserve.\nHistoric inequalities in education for racial0ethnic minorities do not appear to be abating. The National Assessment of Educational Progress reported that by the end of high school, African American and Latino students have math and reading skills that are virtually the same as those of eighth grade White students (U.S. Dept. of Education, 2000) . Although the racial0ethnic achievement gap has largely been declining over time, the current gap among high school students is slightly larger than it was in the late 1980s (Grissmer et al., 1998 , Hedges & Nowell, 1998 Humphreys 1988) . While current policies promote educational access for all, disparate funding continues to foster educational inequality in poor areas including the inner city. School districts educating the highest number of racial0ethnic minority students receive substantially less state and local money per student and 35 out of 48 states studied had a funding gap for racial0ethnic minority students, with the nationwide funding gap equaling $1,099 per pupil (Carey, 2004) . A recent study prepared for the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future (NCTAF), \"Fifty Years after Brown v. Board of Education: A Two-Tiered Education System\" reported that schools serving predominantly low income and minority students were more likely to have unprepared teachers and insufficient classroom supplies (Carroll et al., 2004) . In California, almost half of the teachers (48%) in high-risk schools report that \u0546 20% of their colleagues are not fully credentialed, whereas only 18% of the teachers in low-risk schools report \u0546 20% of their colleagues have incomplete credentials. In New York, 63% of New York City teachers reported classroom computers did not have internet access compared to 36% of teachers in New York City suburbs. Given inequities in the allocation of funding, classroom supplies, and teacher certification, racial0ethnic minorities may continue to receive a poorer quality of education. Recent analyses from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K) found much smaller gaps in the Black-White test scores suggesting that African Americans have made real gains relative to non-Hispanic Whites in the past few decades (Fryer & Levitt, 2004) . Nevertheless, presumptions about the expected level of neuropsychological performance for a given education level among urban educated African Americans and Hispanics may be erroneous. Our data suggest that when working with racial0ethnic minority individuals who have less than a high school education, it would be prudent to assess their reading level, as educational quality may affect their neuropsychological test performance.\nRefining neuropsychological assessment techniques are especially important in HIV0AIDS, a disease that disproportionately affects African Americans and Hispanics; African Americans comprise 42% of persons living with AIDS and Hispanics comprise 20% (CDC, 2003) . Diagnosis of HIV-related cognitive impairment will require an unprecedented understanding of the interplay of sociocultural factors and brain pathology. Our findings raise concerns about diagnostic specificity among HIV1 individuals with low literacy and indicate the need to examine educational quality and its contribution to risk and resilience of HIV-related cognitive impairment in racial0ethnic minorities."}]
