Alzheimer described the \"miliary bodies\" ( plaques) and \"dense bundles of fibrils\" (tangles) which we today know are the hallmarks of the disease. In 1985, researchers succeeded in purifying plaque cores and amyloid angiopathy, and the 4 kD b-amyloid (Ab) peptide was identified as the main component (Glenner and Wong 1984; Masters et al. 1985) . This breakthrough paved the way for the cloning of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene (Kang et al. 1987 ). Almost at the same time, it was shown that tangles are composed of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau protein (Grundke-Iqbal et al. 1986 ). These important achievements marked the start of modern AD research.\nToday, detailed knowledge is available about APP metabolism and Ab generation and on tau protein homeostasis. Largely based on the mutations found in familial AD (FAD), Ab has been proposed as the driving force in the disease process. In line with this, the \"amyloid cascade hypothesis\" for AD (Hardy and Selkoe 2002) posits that an imbalance between the production and clearance of Ab is the initiating event in disease pathogenesis, ultimately leading to neuronal degeneration and dementia. This research progress has been translated into novel treatment strategies with disease-modifying potential. A large number of anti-Ab drug candidates, such as those used in Ab immunotherapy, secretase inhibitors, and Ab aggregation inhibitors, are in various phases of clinical treatment trials . It should be noted, however, that the amyloid cascade hypothesis has not been proven with certainty in late-onset AD, the most common form of the disease.\nDisease-modifying drugs will probably be most effective in the earlier stages of the disease, before plaque and tangle load and neurodegeneration become too severe (Das et al. 2001 ; Levites et al. 2006; Garcia-Alloza et al. 2009 ). Thus, these treatments should be administered in the predementia stage, or even in presymptomatic individuals. Further, in order for treatments to be labeled as \"disease-modifying,\" they must show a beneficial effect on cognition, as well as evidence that the drug does indeed affect the central disease processes and hallmark neuropathology (Siemers 2009 ). These challenges have created a need for biomarkers that reflect core elements of the disease process, to serve as diagnostic aids and as tools to identify and monitor the biochemical mechanism of action of the drug. In this chapter, we review the development of candidate biomarkers of AD from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma. We focus on established biomarkers, those that have been evaluated in several studies by different research groups, and we discuss their implementation in clinical routine and their potential role in clinical trials."}, {"section_title": "FLUID BIOMARKERS AND THE BRAIN", "text": "Biomarkers are objective measures of a biological or pathogenic process that can be used to evaluate disease risk or prognosis, to guide clinical diagnosis, or to monitor therapeutic interventions ). The CSF is in direct contact with the extracellular space of the brain, and biochemical changes in the brain are therefore reflected in the CSF. The CSF is thus the optimal source for AD biomarkers.\nSince Ab42 and tau have been shown to be the primary protein components of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, respectively, the levels of these proteins in CSF have been assessed as potential biomarkers of these pathologic features (Fig. 1) . Levels of Ab42 in postmortem ventricular CSF have been shown to correlate with plaque load at autopsy (Strozyk et al. 2003) . Similar results have been reported in antemortem lumbar CSF, with low levels correlating with postmortem plaque load (Tapiola et al. 2009 ). The development of Ab ligands suitable for positron emission tomography (PET) has enabled direct visualization of fibrillar Ab load in the brain in living individuals. Studies have consistently found a relationship between in vivo amyloid load as assessed by Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB)-PET binding and CSF Ab42, with higher 11C PIB binding correlating with lower CSF Ab42 levels (Fagan et al. 2006; Forsberg et al. 2008; Grimmer et al. 2009; Tolboom et al. 2009 ). A similar relationship has been found between CSF Ab42 and binding of 18F FDDNP, a PET ligand believed to label both plaques and tangles (Tolboom et al. 2009 ). These results support the idea that CSF Ab42 is a measure of fibrillar Ab42 and plaque load in the brain. The most widely accepted explanation for the reduced CSF level of Ab42 in AD is that the aggregation of Ab into plaques (and thus retention in the brain parenchyma) results in less Ab being available to diffuse into the CSF.\nEvidence that CSF total tau (T-tau) reflects the intensity of the neuronal and axonal damage and degeneration has come from several types of studies (Fig. 1) . CSF T-tau increases markedly and transiently in acute disorders such as stroke and brain trauma, and the magnitude of the increase positively correlates with the size of the damaged tissue and negatively correlates with clinical outcome (Hesse et al. 2001; Ost et al. 2006; Zetterberg et al. 2006) . The degree of increase in CSF T-tau in chronic neurodegenerative disorders is highest in disorders with the most rapid neuronal degeneration, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (Otto et al. 1997) . High CSF T-tau is also associated with a faster progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD (Blom et al. 2009) , and a more rapid cognitive decline and higher mortality in AD cases (Samgard et al. 2009; Wallin et al. 2009 ). However, one study found that CSF Ttau correlates with postmortem tangle load (Tapiola et al. 2009 ), suggesting that the release of tau specifically from degenerating tanglebearing neurons may contribute to the CSF level of T-tau. Consistent with this idea, binding of 18F FDDNP, an agent that is reported to label both plaques and tangles, positively correlates with CSF T-tau levels (Tolboom et al. 2009) .\nIt is logical to postulate that phosphorylated tau (P-tau) in CSF reflects the phosphorylation state of the tau protein in the central nervous system (CNS; Fig. 1 ). Positive correlations between CSF levels of P-tau 181 and P-tau 231 (tau phosphorylated at residues 181 and 231, respectively) and neocortical tangle pathology at autopsy have been reported (Buerger et al. 2006; Tapiola et al. 2009 ). High CSF P-tau181 is also associated with a faster progression from MCI to AD (Blom et al. 2009) , and a more rapid cognitive decline in AD cases (Samgard et al. 2009 ), as well as those with very mild AD dementia (Snider et al. 2009 ). These findings support the hypothesis that the CSF level of P-tau reflects the phosphorylation state of tau and the formation of tangles in the brain."}, {"section_title": "FLUID BIOMARKERS FOR AD DIAGNOSIS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "b-Amyloid Isoforms", "text": "The discovery that b-amyloid (Ab) is produced during normal cell metabolism and is secreted into the CSF served as the basis for Ab biomarker development (Seubert et al. 1992) .

CSF Ab42 in AD is decreased to approximately 50% of control levels, as has been shown using several different enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods (Sunderland et al. 2003; Blennow 2004 ).\nTangle pathology P-tau 181 and P-tau 231"}, {"section_title": "Neuronal and axonal degeneration", "text": "T-tau, VLP-1, NF protein\nInflammation and oxidative stress Interleukins, e.g., IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b2 Acute phase proteins, e.g., \u03b1 1 -ACT Isoprostanes Complement proteins, e.g., C1q\nPlaque pathology A\u03b242 / A\u03b240 A\u03b2 oligomers \u03b2-sAPP / \u03b1-sAPP BACE1 activity Figure 1 .

The most commonly used ELISA method for T-tau is based on monoclonal antibodies that detect all isoforms of tau independently of phosphorylation state (Blennow et al. 1995) . Numerous studies have used this assay, and consistently report a marked increase of CSF T-tau in AD to around 300% of control levels (Sunderland et al. 2003; Blennow 2004 )."}, {"section_title": "Phosphorylated Tau Protein", "text": "The most commonly used ELISA methods for P-tau in CSF use antibodies that are specific for phosphorylation at either threonine 181 (P-Tau181) or threonine 231 (P-Tau231; Kohnken et al. 2000; Vanmechelen et al. 2000) . Studies using these assays have consistently found a marked increase in CSF P-tau in AD (Blennow 2004) . Research that compared these P-tau assays directly found a very high correlation between the methods and similar diagnostic performances (Hampel et al. 2004 )."}, {"section_title": "Combination of Tau and Ab as Biomarkers", "text": "Several studies have shown that the diagnostic accuracy for the combination of CSF T-tau, P-tau and Ab42 is higher than for any biomarker alone (Galasko et al. 1998; Reimenschneider et al. 2002; Maddalena et al. 2003; Zetterberg et al. 2003; Hansson et al. 2006) . A logical strategy, therefore, was to develop a multiparameter assay for simultaneous quantification of these CSF biomarkers, based on the Luminex TM xMAP technology (Olsson et al. 2005) . This assay has been used in several recent large multicenter studies on CSF biomarkers, and its diagnostic performance has been good (Hansson et al. 2006; Lewczuk et al. 2008; Mattsson et al. 2009; Shaw et al. 2009 ). The measured values for CSF levels of the biomarkers differ between the Luminex technique and the ELISA methods (Olsson et al. 2005; Lewczuk et al. 2008) . There are likely to be several reasons for this, including differences in the pairs of antibodies selected, the method for coupling antibodies to beads, the method of coating plates, differences in the calibrators, and differences in the incubation conditions. Correction factors have been used to convert results from one technique to the other, allowing the results to be compared (Olsson et al. 2005; Mattsson et al. 2009 )."}, {"section_title": "DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMANCE OF FLUID BIOMARKERS AD with Dementia", "text": "Numerous studies have found a marked increase in CSF T-tau and P-tau, together with a marked decrease in Ab42, in AD cases with dementia. These measurements can be used to discriminate patients with AD from the nondemented aged with a sensitivity and specificity that both lie above 80% (Blennow and Hampel 2003; Blennow 2004) . CSF levels of these markers are normal in several important differential diagnoses, such as depression and Parkinson disease (Blennow 2004) . Combined analyses of these biomarkers give a better diagnostic performance than any biomarker alone (Galasko et al. 1998; Maddalena et al. 2003; Hansson et al. 2006; Mattsson et al. 2009 ). CSF P-tau, in particular, aids in the differentiation of AD from other dementias, such as frontotemporal dementia and Lewy body dementia (Hampel et al. 2004) , but the diagnostic performance of CSF biomarkers to discriminate AD from other dementias is not optimal. There are several reasons for this. First, most studies of CSF biomarkers are based on clinically diagnosed cases, which introduces a relatively large percentage of misdiagnosis (Blennow 2005; Forman et al. 2006 ). Second, a significant percentage of the nondemented elderly have enough plaques and tangles to warrant a neuropathological diagnosis of AD (Snowdon 1997; Price and Morris 1999) . Third, there is a large overlap in pathology between AD and other dementias, such as Lewy body dementia and vascular dementia (Jellinger 1996; Kotzbauer et al. 2001; Schneider et al. 2009 ). This overlap in pathology essentially precludes the possibility K. Blennow et al. of finding any biomarkers that have close to 100% sensitivity and specificity for AD."}, {"section_title": "Autopsy-Verified AD", "text": "Several studies have examined the diagnostic performance of CSF biomarkers in patient series in which diagnosis can subsequently be confirmed by autopsy. CSF biomarkers have high sensitivity and specificity in discriminating AD from both the cognitively normal elderly and from patients with other dementias, such as frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia and vascular dementia (Clark et al. 2003; Sunderland et al. 2003; Bian et al. 2008; Koopman et al. 2009; Shaw et al. 2009 ). CSF biomarkers have thus been validated in patient series with a neuropathological follow-up, showing similar or better discriminatory power than in patient series with clinical diagnoses only."}, {"section_title": "Prodromal AD", "text": "Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers also have a high predictive value in identifying prodromal AD in MCI cases (Blennow and Hampel 2003) . A recent study with an extended clinical followup period showed that the combination of all three core CSF biomarkers (T-tau, P-tau, and Ab42) had a sensitivity of 95% for the identification of prodromal AD in MCI (Hansson et al. 2006) . These CSF markers have also been shown to predict the rate of cognitive decline in patients with MCI/very mild AD dementia (Snider et al. 2009) . A high predictive value has also been verified in large multicenter studies, including the ADNI study (Shaw et al. 2009 ), the DESCRIPA study (Visser et al. 2009) , and the Swedish Brain Power project (Mattsson et al. 2009 ). These results demonstrate that CSF biomarkers may be valuable clinical diagnostic tools to identify MCI cases with prodromal AD."}, {"section_title": "Preclinical AD", "text": "Preclinical AD denotes cognitively normal individuals harboring early AD pathology, not severe enough to cause cognitive symptoms.\nSome studies have examined whether CSF biomarkers are useful in the preclinical stage to identify patients who will subsequently develop AD dementia. Two population-based studies found a significant reduction in CSF Ab42 in cognitively normal elderly who later developed AD, whereas there was no significant change in CSF T-tau or P-tau (Skoog et al. 2003; Gustafson et al. 2007) . A recent clinical study also found that CSF Ab42, but not T-tau and P-tau, predicts cognitive decline in the healthy elderly (Stomrud et al. 2007) . Four independent studies have identified the CSF tau/Ab42 ratio (but not these markers individually) as a strong predictor of future cognitive decline (within a few years) in nondemented elders (Fagan et al. 2007; Li et al. 2007; Craig-Schapiro et al. 2010; Tarawneh et al. 2011) , similar to its ability to predict AD dementia in MCI cohorts (Hansson et al. 2006) . Asymptomatic carriers of FAD mutations also have low CSF Ab42 (Moonis et al. 2005) , and high T-tau and P-tau (Ringman et al. 2008 ). These results extend earlier animal data suggesting that the amyloidogenic process is upstream of tau pathology in AD (Gotz et al. 2001; Lewis et al. 2001) . Consistent with this idea, two recent studies reported an association between low CSF Ab42 levels and brain atrophy in cognitively normal elders (Fagan et al. 2009a; Fjell et al. 2010) , whereas CSF tau and ptau181 levels were associated with atrophy in earlystage MCI/AD (Fagan et al. 2009a ). These biomarker observations suggest that Ab aggregation and deposition (as evidenced by reduced CSF Ab42) are associated with brain atrophy in the preclinical phase of the disease, whereas changes in CSF tau and accelerated brain atrophy are later events in the disease that occur with or just prior to cognitive decline and subsequent clinical progression (Fig. 2) . Additional studies are required to confirm these findings.\nA recent large study showed that cognitively normal elderly who are positive for PIB-PET (indicating the presence of brain amyloid) have low levels of CSF Ab42 (Fagan et al. 2009b) , confirming results from an earlier, smaller study (Fagan et al. 2006) . However, in this larger cohort, CSF Ab42 was found to also be low in a small subset of PIB-negative individuals (Fagan et al. 2009b ). This finding suggests that low CSF Ab42 may serve as a harbinger of future amyloid deposition in the preclinical period. Longitudinal PIB follow-up in these individuals will be required to test this hypothesis. Alternatively, low CSF Ab42 in the absence of PIB positivity may be an indicator of Ab aggregation in diffuse (PIB-negative) plaques or the accumulation of oligomeric species of Ab within brain parenchyma prior to substantial fibrillar (PIB-positive) Ab deposition, or may simply reflect the low end of the normal spectrum of CSF Ab42 levels. In support of the first alternative hypothesis, one of the PIB-negative individuals with low CSF Ab42 came to autopsy and was found to have widespread diffuse, but minimal fibrillar, plaque deposits, suggesting that low CSF Ab42 may mark diffuse plaques in addition to fibrillar plaques (Cairns et al. 2009 ). Regardless of the underlying biological mechanism(s), these results suggest that CSF Ab42 is a marker of AD plaque pathology very early in the disease process ( prior to cognitive symptoms). However, it remains to be determined whether CSF Ab42 levels will allow the prediction of prodromal AD in individual cases. Also, although these data offer important insights into the normal pathophysiology of the disease, the use of biomarkers to predict AD in the asymptomatic elderly is not warranted until registered drugs are available that offer a distinct disease-modifying effect combined with few side-effects. However, such biomarkers may be very useful in the immediate future for the design and evaluation of prevention trials by allowing one to enroll individuals who are still cognitively normal but are in the preclinical stage of the disease and, importantly, are within a few years of developing cognitive symptoms."}, {"section_title": "NOVEL FLUID BIOMARKERS FOR AD", "text": "There are numerous publications describing candidate CSF biomarkers other than Ab and tau, but initial promising results have most often not been reproduced (Table 1) .

BACE1 expression and enzymatic activity are both increased in postmortem brains of patients with AD (Fukumoto et al. 2002; Yang et al. 2003) . BACE1 can be measured in CSF, and its concentration and activity increase in AD, preferentially in MCI cases with prodromal AD (Holsinger et al. 2004; Zhong et al. 2007; Zetterberg et al. 2008 ). These results suggest that up-regulation of BACE1 is an early pathogenic event in AD."}, {"section_title": "Ab Oligomers", "text": "Aggregation of soluble Ab to form insoluble fibrillar aggregates in plaques has long been regarded as the central pathogenic event in AD. However, recent results suggest that soluble Ab oligomers inhibit long-term potentiation, the proposed biological substrate of memory, thereby playing a role in AD pathogenesis (Walsh and Selkoe 2007) . Measurement of Ab oligomers in CSF may thus be an important core biomarker for AD. Some preliminary studies on Ab oligomers in CSF have been published. Using monoclonal antibodies for Ab oligomers in an assay with PCR-based signal amplification, one study reported a marked increase in AD autopsy CSF (Georganopoulou et al. 2005) . Flow cytometric results also suggest that Ab oligomers are present in CSF, but no information on the diagnostic utility of this assay has been presented (Santos et al. 2007) . A weak band migrating at the size expected for Ab dimers appears in CSF immunoprecipitation experiments, utilizing an anti-Ab antibody followed by SDS -PAGE and immunoblotting, but there is no clear correlation with AD (Klyubin et al. 2008) . Immunoassays in which a monocloncal antibody is used for capture, and the same, biotinylated, antibody is used for detection, may be used to quantify protein aggregates, because monomers will not be detected since the epitope is already occupied by the capture antibody. Using ELISA methods based on this principle, higher CSF levels of Ab oligomers were found in AD (Fukumoto et al. 2010 ). These promising results call for further studies, and need to be replicated in larger independent patient materials. It seems clear that although Ab oligomers are an attractive AD biomarker candidate, the level of such oligomers is very low compared with that of Ab monomers.

For example, visinin-like protein 1 (VILIP-1) is a highly expressed neuronal calcium sensor protein that was identified by gene array analyses designed to search for brain-specific protein biomarkers (Laterza et al. 2006) . CSF VLP-1 increased markedly in AD in a clinical study, with a diagnostic performance similar to that of CSF tau and Ab (Lee et al. 2008) . CSF levels of VLP-1 were higher in APOE 14-positive cases, and correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. A recent study of VILIP-1 showed that the ratio of VILIP-1/Ab42 was as good or better than tau/Ab42 in predicting progression from cognitively normal to very mild dementia (Tarawneh et al. 2011) .\nNeurofilament (NF) proteins are structural components of the neuronal axons. The expression of such proteins is particularly high in large myelinated axons (Friede and Samorajski 1970) . Accordingly, high CSF levels of NF proteins are found in disorders with subcortical pathology, such as vascular dementia and normal-pressure hydrocephalus (Sjogren et al. 2001a; Agren-Wilson et al. 2007 ). CSF levels are also high in frontotemporal dementia, whereas they are normal in most cases of AD (Sjogren et al. 2000) . CSF NF proteins may thus be valuable for differentiation between AD, frontotemporal dementia, and subcortical dementia disorders.\nClinicopathologic studies have demonstrated that synaptic density is the variable that best correlates with cognitive performance (Terry et al. 1991) . Thus, one might predict that synaptic proteins would be the class of biomarkers most tightly linked to cognition. Several pre-and postsynaptic proteins have been identified in CSF using a procedure based on protein precipitation followed by liquid-phase isoelectric focusing and western blotting. These proteins include rab3a, synaptotagmin, growthassociated protein (GAP-43), synaptosomalassociated protein (SNAP-25), and neurogranin (Davidsson et al. 1999 ). An immunoassay for GAP-43 showed that CSF levels are higher in AD patients than in controls and patients with frontotemporal dementia (Sjogren et al. 2001b ).

A number of reports published in the 1990s and early 2000s describe alterations in the levels of various inflammatory and signaling molecules, as well as markers of oxidative stress (e.g., a1-antichymotrypsin, isoprostane, the interleukins, TNFa, interferon-g, complement C1q, and TGF-b) in AD CSF (Zetterberg et al. 2004; Craig-Schapiro et al. 2009 ). However, results have been very inconsistent, probably owing to methodological differences (e.g., in the procedures for CSF collection and processing, assay differences, and criteria used for subject ascertainment), prevalence of comorbidities in the studied cohorts, and methods of diagnosis. Unbiased proteomics methods have more recently been used to identify molecules that differ between AD and control CSF (and serum and plasma). These studies have consistently identified a plethora of inflammatory markers that differ in abundance between clinical groups (Castano et al. 2006; Finehout et al. 2007 ). However, even in these unbiased screens, the direction of reported difference in abundance has not been consistent. Despite this, one astrocyte marker, YKL-40, discovered in an unbiased proteomic screen, has recently been validated in a large cohort of cognitively normal and AD subjects to be increased in AD and to predict clinical worsening from cognitively normal to very mild dementia (CraigShapiro et al. 2010 ). The recent availability of commercial multiplexed assays should permit analysis of a large panel of inflammatory and signaling molecules in large-scale studies. It is conceivable (and probable) that adding markers of neuroinflammation to the other CSF markers (such as Ab42, tau, and P-tau) will further strengthen diagnostic and prognostic capability (Hu et al. 2010) .\nAD pathogenesis also includes free radicalmediated injury to neurons. Lipid peroxidation is an important consequence of such damage, and it generates many products, including F2-isoprostanes. These molecules may serve as biomarkers for this pathogenic process. CSF F2-isoprostane levels have been reported to be increased in AD (Montine et al. 2007 ). Recent studies also show an increase in F2-isoprostanes in MCI cases with prodromal AD (Brys et al. 2009a ) and in asymptomatic carriers of FAD mutations (Ringman et al. 2008) . In contrast, studies on F2-isoprostanes in plasma have reported conflicting results, probably because the contribution of brain-derived F2-isoprostanes to plasma is clouded by the much larger contribution of peripherally derived F2-isoprostanes (Montine et al. 2007 )."}, {"section_title": "SILK Technology", "text": "Recently a new in vivo technique, known as Stable Isotope Labeling Kinetics (SILK), has been developed to measure the production and clearance rates of CNS proteins in humans (Figure 3) .

Using mass spectrometry to compare the amounts of labeled versus unlabeled proteins over time, very precise synthesis, clearance, and dose -response curves can be developed. This technique was first applied to determine the synthesis and clearance rates of Ab in the CNS (Bateman et al. 2006 ). The fractional production and clearance rates of Ab in vivo was found to be extremely rapid (7.6% per hr and 8.3% per hr, respectively), with absolute concentrations in the CSF varying widely between sampling times. This technique was used more recently in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to demonstrate the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship between an Ab synthesis inhibitor and the absolute rate of CNS Ab synthesis (Bateman et al. 2009 ). In addition, this method identified slower fractional Ab clearance with no change in fractional Ab synthesis in late-onset AD versus age-matched controls (Mawuenyega et al. 2010) . Since this technique automatically labels all newly synthesized proteins, its potential lies in the fact that it allows for the evaluation of other proteins relevant to AD, other neurodegenerative diseases, and the metabolism of multiple biomarkers simultaneously. As such, this technology may uncover robust fluid biomarkers that will be useful for assessing disease risk, improving AD diagnosis and prognosis, tracking disease progression, and evaluating treatment efficacy."}, {"section_title": "Plasma Biomarkers", "text": "Efforts to find reliable biomarkers for AD in peripheral blood have had little success. Several candidate blood biomarkers have been proposed, but have been difficult to verify in independent studies. In this review we focus on plasma Ab, which is the most extensively examined peripheral biomarker for AD. We also review some explorative pilot studies with promising results.\nMany studies have examined plasma Ab as a biomarker for AD, but the findings are contradictory. Some groups report slightly higher plasma levels of either Ab42 or Ab40 in AD, although with a broad overlap between patients and controls, whereas most studies find no change (Irizarry 2004) . Studies examining the value of plasma Ab in predicting AD in the cognitively normal elderly also show a very broad overlap in plasma Ab42 and Ab40 levels. Some studies report that high plasma Ab42, or a high Ab42/Ab40 ratio, is a risk indicator for future AD, whereas others report the opposite (Mayeux et al. 2003; Pomara et al. 2005; van Oijen et al. 2006; Graff-Radford et al. 2007 ). These discouraging results are probably due to the fact that the majority of plasma Ab is derived from peripheral tissues, and does not reflect brain Ab turnover or metabolism (Mehta et al. 2000) . This is consistent with a lack of correlation between plasma Ab species and brain amyloid load as determined by PIB binding (Fagan et al. 2006 (Fagan et al. , 2009b . It is possible, however, that the hydrophobic nature of Ab causes it to bind to plasma proteins, which may result in epitope masking and other analytical interferences (Kuo et al. 1999) .\nThere are some recent reports that present promising novel blood biomarkers for AD. Combined multivariate analysis of 18 plasma signaling and inflammatory proteins was found to identify AD patients and predict future AD, Figure 3 . Schematic drawing of the principles for the stable isotope labeling kinetics technology for measuring the production and clearance of total b-amyloid (Ab) in the brain.\nwith high accuracy, in MCI patients (Ray et al. 2007 ). This protein panel was identified after screening a large number of known proteins using a filter-based protein array. Further independent studies are needed to verify if this panel is the optimal combination of plasma biomarkers, as well as to determine their diagnostic value. Another study using explorative proteomics technology identified AD-associated changes in the plasma levels of complement factor H and a2-macroglobulin (Hye et al. 2006 ). This finding was replicated using semiquantitative immunoblotting techniques. A significant change was also reported in the ratio of the microcirculation regulating factor midregional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide to carboxy-terminal endothelin-1 precursor fragment, both of which regulate microcirculation, in plasma from AD patients (Buerger et al. 2009 ). If replicated in independent studies using immunoassay techniques suitable for routine diagnostic laboratories, these types of plasma protein panels may serve as useful screening tests for AD."}, {"section_title": "FLUID BIOMARKERS IN CLINICAL TRIALS", "text": "In addition to their potential as tools for clinical diagnosis, CSF biomarkers may be valuable in drug development in at least four different ways. These uses are as diagnostic markers for the enrichment of AD cases, for patient stratification, as safety markers, and as detectors and monitors of biochemical drug effects (Table 2) ."}, {"section_title": "Improved Diagnosis/Enrichment of AD Cases", "text": "Diagnosing early AD is a great challenge for clinicians because MCI cases only have a mild disturbance in episodic memory and executive dysfunction, whereas other specific symptoms are lacking or are vague and indistinct. The only clinical method available to determine which MCI patients have prodromal AD is an extended follow-up period. Indeed, even at specialized academic centers, the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of AD in cases that have been followed clinically for several years can be relatively low, with sensitivity and specificity figures of 70 -80% (Knopman et al. 2001 ).\nThese figures are considerably lower in patients with early AD (Visser et al. 2005 ) and in primary care settings (Ganguli et al. 2004 ). Assessment of cognitive changes within individuals over a number of years (as determined with semistructured interviews with the patient and a reliable collateral source who knows the patient well, such as a spouse or adult child), can increase diagnostic accuracy (Storandt et al. 2006) . However, this laborious approach is probably not feasible in primary care settings. Clinical MCI trials of cholinesterase inhibitors, in which having a reduced conversion rate to AD was used as a clinical endpoint, have failed to find any significant benefit of the drugs (Raschetti et al. 2007 ). These trials have recruited unselected MCI cases, meaning that approximately half of the cases do not have prodromal AD, and thus will not convert. This may have adversely affected the possibility of detecting any positive clinical effect of the drug ). Addition of positive CSF biomarkers as inclusion criteria in MCI and even prevention trials will increase the proportion of subjects with underlying AD pathology and thereby increase the possibility of detecting a positive effect of the drug."}, {"section_title": "Stratification of AD Cases Based on Biomarker Data", "text": "It is well established that AD is a heterogeneous disorder, at both the clinical and neuropathological levels . It is quite possible that the effects of proposed diseasemodifying drugs will differ between subgroups of AD patients with respect to degree of plaque and tangle pathology (as evidenced by biomarkers) or genetic determinants. As an example, passive immunization was reported to differ both in treatment effect and side-effects between APOE 14 carriers and noncarriers (Salloway et al. 2009 ).\nSince CSF biomarkers reflect the central pathogenic processes in AD, they may be used in post-hoc analyses to stratify the patient cohort in clinical trials. For example, one could postulate that a patient subgroup with a certain biomarker trait, such as low CSF Ab42"}, {"section_title": "Safety Monitoring", "text": "Trials of the new type of disease-modifying treatments have been hampered by side-effects including meningoencephalitis, which was observed in a subset of cases in the AN-1792 trial on active Ab immunotherapy, and vasogenic edema, which was observed in the AAB-001 trial of passive immunotherapy (Orgogozo et al. 2003; Salloway et al. 2009 ). CSF analysis is the standard method to diagnose both encephalitis and blood -brain barrier damage associated with disorders that cause edema (Tibbling et al. 1977; Andersson et al. 1994) . It is also possible to use the baseline CSF sample to initially identify and exclude cases with chronic infectious or "}, {"section_title": "Monitoring the Biochemical Effect of a Drug", "text": "The effects of disease-modifying anti-Ab drugs on plaque pathology are commonly evaluated in AD transgenic mice, but these animal models have had a low predictive power for treatment success in patients with sporadic AD . To bridge the gap between animal studies and large clinical trials, evidence for a true effect on AD pathogenesis directly in man would help in selecting the most promising drug candidates. In slowly progressive disorders such as AD, evaluation of the clinical effect of a drug using rating scales requires large patient materials and extended treatment periods. For drugs with a symptomatic effect, such as cholinesterase inhibitors, an early improvement in cognitive function is expected. In contrast, a disease-modifying drug cannot be expected to have an early effect on symptoms, but will instead lead to a less pronounced decline in cognitive function over years. Thus, the number of patients needed to detect a disease-modifying effect on cognition is probably larger, and the treatment period longer, than for a symptom-modifying drug.\nBiomarkers used to identify and monitor the biochemical effect of drugs are known as \"theragnostic markers\" . Such markers may be used to identify and monitor both the specific effect of a drug on its intended target and its effect on downstream pathogenic events. A trial that uses such markers would probably require relatively small amounts of patient materials and short treatment periods. Such a strategy may be particularly suitable for making a go/no-go decision for large and expensive phase II or III clinical trials. This approach is feasible given results from longitudinal studies demonstrating low intra-individual variability of CSF T-tau, P-tau, and Ab42 levels over time Zetterberg et al. 2007 ). Some of these biomarkers might also serve as substitutes ( proxies) for clinical endpoints. However, fullscale clinical trials will be required to determine whether this is possible. Lastly, for regulatory purposes, a claim for a disease-modifying effect can only be made when a drug has been proven to have both an effect on cognition and biomarker evidence of an effect on the central pathogenic processes (Siemers 2009; Vellas 2009 ). To date, there are only preliminary reports suggesting that CSF biomarkers may be useful as theragnostic markers. Importantly, drug candidates with no proven effect on the molecular pathogenesis of AD, such as cholinesterase inhibitors and lithium, have no effect on AD CSF core biomarkers Hampel et al. 2009 ). Nevertheless, data from animal studies show that treatment with g-secretase inhibitors results in a reduction of cortical, CSF, and plasma levels of Ab (Lanz et al. 2004; Anderson et al. 2005) . Similarly, treatment in monkeys with a BACE1 inhibitor results in a reduction in CSF Ab42, Ab40, and sAPPb levels (Sankaranarayanan et al. 2009 ). In AD cases, it is uncertain how CSF Ab may respond to treatment with efficacious anti-Ab drugs. In a phase IIa study of the Ab clearance-enhancing compound PBT2, a significant dose-dependent reduction in CSF Ab42 levels during treatment was observed (Lannfelt et al. 2008) . Results from a clinical study on the amyloid-targeting drug phenserine also suggest that CSF Ab levels as a biomarker may be valuable for evaluating treatment effects (Kadir et al. 2008) . However, in the interrupted phase IIa AN1792 trial, no significant effect was found on CSF Ab42, despite a decrease toward normal levels of the downstream biomarker T-tau (Gilman et al. 2005) . A clinical study of g-secretase"}, {"section_title": "FLUID BIOMARKERS AS ENDOPHENOTYPES IN GENETIC STUDIES", "text": "Just as CSF biomarker data from well-characterized, longitudinally followed cohorts may be used to guide diagnosis and estimate prognosis, it can also be used to identify genetic markers that are associated with AD risk. Compared with typical genetic studies of AD that rely on less precise clinical diagnoses, genetic studies based on quantitative endophenotype data can provide more power. In support of this approach, recent studies have shown that elevated CSF T-tau and P-tau levels are associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms in the MAPT gene (from which tau protein is produced; Kauwe et al. 2008) . Likewise, CSF Ab levels have been found to associate with polymorphisms in several genes (Kauwe et al. 2009 ). In this way, by \"converting\" endophenotype data derived from fluid biomarkers to novel genetic biomarkers, it may be possible to identify individuals at greater risk of developing AD and, in the near future, provide treatment options prior to the development of any AD pathology."}, {"section_title": "FUTURE PERSPECTIVES Overlapping Pathology Influences Diagnostic Biomarker Accuracy", "text": "Currently available biomarkers are not perfect in diagnostic accuracy. However, except for technical shortcomings with the biomarkers, there are several fundamental reasons for why a 100% sensitive and specific biomarker for AD is an unreachable goal. First, most biomarker studies are based on clinically diagnosed cases, which introduces a relatively large percentage of misdiagnosis (Forman et al. 2006; Engelborghs et al. 2008) . Second, a significant percentage of nondemented elderly have enough plaques and tangles to warrant a neuropathological diagnosis of AD (Snowdon 1997; Price and Morris 1999) . Third, there is a large overlap in pathology between AD and other dementias, such as Lewy body dementia and vascular dementia (Jellinger 1996; Kotzbauer et al. 2001; Schneider et al. 2009 ). This overlap in pathology essentially precludes the possibility of finding biomarkers that have close to 100% sensitivity and specificity for AD. One way out of this catch 22-like situation might be to reconsider the terminology. Instead of using the term \"AD biomarkers,\" we could acknowledge that the biomarkers reflect distinct pathogenic or pathologic processes, for example, amyloid retention in the brain and degeneration of nonmyelinated cortical axons. These changes, especially in combination, are frequently seen in AD but may also be present in other neurodegenerative disorders, especially in isolation."}, {"section_title": "Combination of Multiple Biomarker Modalities", "text": "It is logical to suppose that the combination of CSF biomarkers with both structural (CT/MRI) and functional (SPECT/PET) brain imaging will increase the diagnostic accuracy as compared with the use of one biomarker alone. However, only a few studies to date have directly examined this issue. Positive CSF biomarkers combined with either CTor MRI measurements of medial temporal lobe atrophy have been found to increase the accuracy of an AD diagnosis (Schoonenboom et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2008; Brys et al. 2009b) . A recent study also showed that the combination of positive CSF biomarkers with the degree of structural ADlike abnormalities as shown by MRI improved prediction of the conversion from amnestic MCI to AD better than either biomarker alone (Vemuri et al. 2009 ). Similarly, combining positive CSF biomarkers with an evaluation of regional cerebral blood flow using either the 133Xe method or SPECT has been shown to improve the accuracy of a prodromal AD diagnosis above that achieved with either biomarker alone (Okamura et al. 2002; Hansson et al. 2007b) . Further, although no study has examined the added diagnostic value of PIB-PET and CSF biomarkers, there is a strict negative correlation between the degree of PIB binding as seen in PET images and the CSF level of Ab42 (Fagan et al. 2006 (Fagan et al. , 2009b Forsberg et al. 2008; Grimmer et al. 2009 ). The relationship between PIB binding and the tau/Ab42 and ptau/Ab ratios is even stronger than for Ab42 alone . Large multicenter studies are needed to further define the added diagnostic value of combining multiple biomarker modalities. Such studies will also provide information on the optimal brain region to evaluate for atrophy by MRI or Ab load by PET. Complementary data are also needed to evaluate whether new high-resolution MRI scanners and newly developed amyloid ligands, such as AZD2184 and AV-45, will improve diagnostic sensitivity and specificity (Choi et al. 2009; Nyberg et al. 2009 )."}, {"section_title": "Novel Research Criteria for AD", "text": "The current clinical diagnostic criteria for AD were outlined more than 25 years ago by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders (NINCDS-ADRDA) Work Group. They depend largely on the exclusion of causes other than AD for dementia (McKhann et al. 1984) . These criteria state that a diagnosis of AD cannot be made until the patient has dementia, which is defined as \"cognitive symptoms severe enough to interfere with social or occupational activities.\" The DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria, which are used for routine diagnosis, also require that a patient demonstrate dementia before a diagnosis of AD is possible (WHO 1992; American Psychiatric Association 2000) . If the new disease-modifying drugs prove to be effective and become clinically available, these present criteria will hinder patients in the early stages of the disease, certainly in the preclinical stage, from receiving effective therapy.\nFor this reason, new criteria for different stages of AD have recently been suggested (Dubois et al. 2007; Albert et al. 2011; McKhann et al. 2011; Sperling et al. 2011 ). These criteria have been constructed to permit a diagnosis of AD in earlier stages of the disease, and are centered on the clinical identification of episodic memory impairment together with one or more abnormal biomarkers, including MRI, PET, and CSF markers. More detailed guidelines are needed to establish how the use of biomarkers can be implemented in the diagnostic procedure for early AD to be used in clinical practice. For example, details are needed regarding the scale that should be applied to measure memory impairment, which assays and cutoffs to use for CSF biomarkers, which brain region (whole brain, hippocampus, or entorhinal cortex) to use to evaluate brain atrophy by MRI, which amyloid ligand to use, and which brain region to use to evaluate brain Ab load by PET. Studies on these issues are just beginning to emerge (Frisoni et al. 2009 ). Biomarker assays also need to be standardized between laboratories and centers to allow for general implementation of cutoff points in the diagnostic algorithms. As a first step in this direction, a global quality control program for CSF biomarkers was recently launched. This program also covers practical details on lumbar puncture and CSF sample processing . Results from the first two rounds in this quality control program have recently been presented."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "There is an enormous amount of literature showing good or excellent diagnostic performance of several biomarkers reflecting different facets of the disease process in AD.
