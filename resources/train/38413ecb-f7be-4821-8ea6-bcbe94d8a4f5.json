[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Many successful approaches in MR brain segmentation use supervised voxel classification, which requires manually labeled training images that are representative of the test images to segment. However, the performance of such methods often deteriorates if training and test images are acquired with different scanners or scanning parameters, since this leads to differences in feature representations between training and test data.\nIn this paper we propose a feature-space transformation (FST) to overcome such differences in feature representations. The proposed FST is derived from unlabeled images of a subject that was scanned with both the source and the target scan protocol. After an affine registration, these images give a mapping between source and target voxels in the feature space. This mapping is then used to map all training samples to the feature representation of the test samples.\nWe evaluated the benefit of the proposed FST on hippocampus segmentation. Experiments were performed on two datasets: one with relatively small differences between training and test images and one with large differences. In both cases, the FST significantly improved the performance compared to using only image normalization. Additionally, we showed that our FST can be used to improve the performance of a state-of-the-art patch-based-atlas-fusion technique in case of large differences between scanners. stripping) (Iglesias et al.

( 2015)).\nSupervised-learning methods can perform very well if they are provided with a large enough training set that is representative of the test dataset. However, performance often deteriorates if training and test datasets have differences in appearance, which can lead to differences in sample distributions in the feature space that is used for the classification. These problems often happen because of differences between scanners or scanning parameters, for example in multi-center datasets. The most common way to deal with such differences between training and test data is by intensity normalization.

Compared to manual segmentation, automatic segmentation can save large amounts of time and eliminate the problem of inter-and intra-observer variability. A widely used and successful method to perform such segmentations is by voxelwise classification based on supervised learning. Here, a manually annotated training set is used to extract features and train a classification system in the determined feature space. Then, the same features are determined for the test voxels and the trained classifier is used to make a decision on which label they should receive. Supervised-learning methods are used for a variety of segmentations tasks, such as whole brain (also called skull neuro-image segmentation use range matching, matching the mean and standard deviation of the datasets, or more extensive normalization techniques. Such extensive normalization techniques can roughly be separated into two groups, where the first group of methods first identify a tissue or multiple tissues of interest (such as white matter, gray matter, CSF, or background) in both the source and the target images and then match the peaks of these tissues in the intensity distributions (Schmidt (2005) ; Christensen (2003) ; Robitaille et al. (2012) ; Leung et al. (2010) ). The second group of intensity-normalization techniques aim to match the intensity distributions of training and test images as a whole, without information of the imaged tissues (Nyul et al. (2000) ; Jager and Hornegger (2009) ; Weisenfeld and Warfteld (2004) ; Guimond et al. (2001) ). The method of Nyul et al. (2000) is most widely used in neuro-image segmentation. It is shown to improve performance on e.g. brain-tissue and white-matter-lesion segmentation, both on same-scanner images (Zhuge and Udupa (2009) ) and between scanners (Shah et al. (2011) ).\nHowever, image normalization techniques have the disadvantage that they aim at normalizing the image intensity only, while classification methods are often also based on other image-derived features. On the other hand, extracting derived features such as Gaussian-scalespace features from intensity-normalized images may still lead to different representations between scan protocols. Images are normalized by different mappings, which propagate differently in the derived features. In this paper, we propose a method that maps not only the intensity of training and test images, but also all the other features used for the classification, all at the same time. We will call this mapping a feature-space transformation (FST), since it maps the entire feature space of a training image to that of a test image. Our method learns the feature-space transformation from images of subjects that were scanned with both the training and the test scan protocol. Since our method involves learning, it can be called a transfer-learning technique (Pan and Yang (2010) ). Transfer learning (sometimes also called domain adaptation) is recently gaining attention in medical image segmentation, since it aims to build a robust classification system by somehow compensating for differences between the distributions of training and test data. Van Opbroek et al. (2015b) showed that transfer-learning techniques can improve segmentation performance across scan protocols over intensity-normalization techniques such as range matching and the method of Nyul et al. (2000) in brain-tissue segmentation and whitematter-lesion segmentation.\nA few papers have been published that apply transfer-learning techniques to neuro-image segmentation (Van Opbroek et al. (2015b , 2015c ; Goetz et al. (2015) ; Kamnitsas et al., 2017; Van Tulder and De Bruijne (2016) ). Most methods aim to compensate for the difference between training and test data in the classifier, for example with a weighted classifier that weights training samples according to resemblance to the test data. These methods show to improve performance compared to traditional, unweighted, classifiers when training and test data are from different scanners or scan protocols. However, these methods have the disadvantage that they only select samples as is, rather than learning how to transform the distribution of the training samples in the feature space as to better match the distribution of test samples. Some deep-learning methods take a different approach to transfer learning by learning a representation that is shared between data different scanners or scan protocols (Kamnitsas et al. (2017); Van Tulder and De Bruijne (2016) ). This way, these methods learn a feature representation that is dataset invariant. We propose an approach for non-deep learning that, rather than learning a shared representation, maps the feature distribution of training samples directly to that of test samples. Our method learns an FST based on pairs of unlabeled images of one or multiple subjects that were scanned with both the source and target protocol. After transformation, a regular (non-transfer) classifier can be trained on the transformed features of the training data.\nWe performed a set of experiments on hippocampus segmentation in two heterogeneous datasets to show the added value of our FST over standard intensity normalization. Hippocampus segmentation is known to be a challenging task, since the gray levels of the hippocampus are very similar to those of neighboring structures such as the amygdala, thalamus, and caudate nucleus (Fischl et al. (2002) ). Most hippocampus-segmentation methods are based on multi-atlas registration, where a set of training images (called atlases) are registered to the test image. The registered training images are then combined to obtain a final segmentation by an atlas-combination method such as majority voting or STAPLE (Warfield et al. (2004) ). Performance can be greatly improved by combining registered atlases with appearance information such as voxel intensities in a supervised classifier (e.g. Powell et al. (2008) ; Coup\u00e9 et al. (2011) ; Van der Lijn et al. (2012) ; Zhang et al. (2012) ; ). However, incorporating such appearance information is likely to lead to problems when training and test images are obtained with different scan protocols. To decrease difference between training and test data, Van der Lijn et al. (2012) used intensity normalization to zero mean, unit norm and Coup\u00e9 et al. (2011) used the technique of Nyul et al. (2000) . In this paper, we investigate whether the use of an FST in such algorithms could improve performance over intensity-normalization techniques.\nA preliminary version of this work has been published as a workshop paper (Van Opbroek et al. (2015a) ). The present paper extends this workshop paper by thorough experiments on a new, enlarged version of the dataset presented in the workshop paper, one additional dataset, and comparison to STAPLE (Warfield et al. (2004) ) and the patch-based-atlas-fusion method of ."}, {"section_title": "Material and methods", "text": "This section describes the proposed method and the data used in the experiments.

For the HarP dataset, the brain extraction tool (BET) (Smith (2002) ) was run with default parameters on all images. Since this gave variable results, a second step was applied. Here, the BET segmentations of all images were non-rigidly registered to each other and per image a majority vote was performed. For the RSS data, a slightly different approach was used since BET gave bad results for the Haste-Odd images. Here, BET was run with default parameters on the 9 T1 rescan images. These masks were then transformed to the Haste-Odd rescan images by an affine registration of each T1 rescan image to its corresponding Haste-Odd rescan image. The final brain masks for all images (also the rescan images) were obtained by non-rigid registration of the 9 rescan images of the same scanner followed by a majority vote.\nBefore calculation of the appearance features, all images were normalized for intensity by a 4th-96th percentile range matching procedure within the brain mask."}, {"section_title": "Registration", "text": "All registrations were performed with the Elastix registration toolbox (Klein et al.

Next, the training voxels inside the ROI were transformed with the FST and used to train an SVM classifier.

For the HarP dataset, we segment all 45 images from each of the 8 sites in Table 1 by training on the other scanner of the site, so training on 1.5 T and testing on 3 T and vice versa. We will refer to this experiment as HarP 1.\nAdditionally, we performed an extra experiment per dataset. As can be seen from Table 1 , only between 1 and 7 training images could be used for HarP 1. Unfortunately, images from other sites could not be used, since no source-target pairs were available between sites. However, a possible way to improve the performance, which was also investigated, is by determining the multi-atlas-probability feature on all images from different scanners than the test image, which results in a total of 128 to 134 atlases (Fig. 2 including the \"other sites\").

These weights are then used to select training samples, which are used to train an SVM classifier.

This way, the parameters were optimized to cope with differences between images from different sites. For the RSS dataset, leave-one-image-out cross validation was used, since there were not enough different sites (or scanners) in this dataset to perform leave-one-site-out cross validation.\nSeparate classifiers were trained for the left and right hippocampus, which improved performance compared to training a single classifier. Probably, this is because the left and right hippocampus have slightly different appearance.\nThe sample correspondence for the FST in Eq. 3 was determined on all voxels within the intersection of the source and target brain masks.

For all three cases, training an SVM on only the multi-atlas probability (SVM Atlas) improved the performance over setting the multi-atlas threshold at 0.5 (Atlas MV). Adding appearance features (without FST), as in the SVM method, improved performance only in HarP 1. This overall decrease in performance is because appearance differs between the scanners and is therefore misleading for classification. In HarP 2, the performance decreased by adding appearance features without FST, probably because here better atlas information is available than in HarP 1. For the RSS dataset, where appearance differs much more between training and test images than in the HarP dataset, the appearance features harmed performance most. Adding appearance features with FST, as in the SVM FST method, significantly improved the performance over using only multi-atlas information (SVM Atlas) and using appearance features without FST (SVM) in all three cases."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Comparison of appearance features with and without FST", "text": "Applying the FST only on the intensity feature and calculating the other appearance features from the transformed image, as in SVM FST Intensity , performed much worse than applying the FST to all appearance features in all three experiments. On RSS, this method performed especially bad, which might be caused by the large difference between training and test data. Transforming the intensity will overcome intensity differences, but this transformation is not smooth in image space. The appearance features calculated from the transformed intensity can then become very different from the features in the test image. The other transfer-learning method, SVM Image Weighting, performed only marginally better than SVM. This is probably because the method was designed to be trained on larger, more diverse, datasets.\nHere it was trained on only few training images, where it often gave a positive weight to only a single training image, which did not give a good classifier.

Fusion therefore seems to use a framework that is better capable of handling small appearance differences than the baseline SVM. When differences are large however (the RSS dataset), performance of Fusion dropped dramatically (much more than SVM). Using an FST to transform image intensity before using Fusion, as in Fusion FST Intensity greatly improved the performance in case of large differences. For small differences however, FST Intensity decreased performance. We argue that this is probably because transforming only the intensity is a suboptimal solution, as was also shown in Table 3 for SVM FST Intensity . black. Fig. 3 shows example segmentations for Atlas MV, SVM Atlas, SVM, and SVM FST on the HarP 2 dataset and on the RSS dataset. For all four images, the methods that use only atlas information, Atlas MV and SVM Atlas, produced segmentations that are too smooth compared to the manual segmentations. The methods that combine atlas information and appearance information, SVM and SVM FST gave more detailed segmentations, where SVM FST gave the best segmentations. In Fig. 3 (e) and 3(q) we can see that SVM produced an under segmentation because of the difference in appearance between training and test data. As can be seen from Fig. 3 (f) and 3(r) this problem was solved by using the FST."}, {"section_title": "Quantitative results", "text": "The example segmentations also show a disadvantage of adding appearance features: it increases the chance of obtaining a segmentation with incorrect topology (i.e. an unconnected segmentation or a segmentation with a hole). This may happen in voxel classifiers that incorporate appearance features because non-neighboring voxels in the image might be close to each other in the feature space, while neighboring voxels in the image are not necessarily close in the feature space. This can easily be solved by a post-processing step such as morphological opening, taking the biggest connected component, smoothing of posterior outputs in the image space, or a graph cut (Van der Lijn et al. (2012) ). Fig. 4 shows Bland-Altman plots for Atlas MV, SVM Atlas, SVM, and SVM FST on segmenting the RSS rescan images. When training on the T1 images ( Fig. 4(a)-(d) ), SVM FST showed a much smaller bias than the other methods and similar variance, indicating more consistent segmentation results across scanners. When training on the Haste-Odd images, Atlas MV, SVM Atlas, and SVM FST showed similar bias and variance. SVM gave a smaller bias, but a much larger variance than the Table 3 Mean Dice overlap of the various methods on 1) the HarP1 dataset trained on images from the same site other scanner than the test image, 2) the HarP2 dataset with multi-atlas probabilities determined from all HarP images except for the ones from the test scanner, 3) the RSS dataset.

Note that the mean volume was much larger when training on the Haste-Odd images than on the T1 images (4000 versus 3000 mm 3 ). This is partly a result of the manual segmentations, which are on average about 15% bigger in the Haste-Odd images than in the T1 images and partly a result of the larger voxel sizes for the Haste-Odd images. Fig. 5 shows the influence of k and N on the performance of our FST for the two experiments on the HarP data and the experiment on the RSS data. As can be seen from the figure, the influence of both k and N on the performance is very small; the difference in average Dice between the worst and the best k and N is only 0.6%. N = 1, k = 10 seems the overall best choice, performing significantly better than the other values for k and non-significantly different from other values for N."}, {"section_title": "Influence of k and N", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Computational cost", "text": "The computational time of the FST was in the order of minutes and depended on N and k. A source-target registration and sampling the voxels took only a couple of seconds.

Our method uses unlabeled images of one or multiple subjects that have been scanned with both the training and the test scan protocol. These images, which we call source-target pairs, give a correspondence between the source and target feature spaces. Training samples are then mapped from the source feature space into the target feature space by applying the median transformation of the k closest source voxels in the feature space.\nWe presented extensive experiments on hippocampus segmentation based on both appearance and atlas features in two datasets: one with relatively small differences between scanners and one with very large differences.In the first dataset, the presented FST improved the performance of an SVM classifier on atlas and appearance features from a mean Dice of 0.74 to 0.75 when few atlases were used and from 0.79 to 0.84 when many atlases were used. In the second dataset, our FST improved the mean Dice from 0.73 to 0.80. On this dataset, we also showed that the FST can be used in combination with patch-based atlas fusion to improve performance across scanners with large differences. Additionally, we showed that our FST can improve the reproducibility across scanners, by decreasing the bias between segmentations of images from different scanners.\nWe believe that the presented method is very useful for machinelearning based segmentation of medical images that have been obtained with different scanners or scanning protocols and have images of a subject acquired with both scanners. The experiments in this paper were all on hippocampus segmentation. However, the presented FST can be used for many more supervised image segmentation tasks, such as brain-tissue segmentation, white-matter lesion segmentation, and segmentation of other brain structures than the hippocampus. This way, we think that our method can aid the applicability of many supervisedsegmentation methods to different datasets and eliminate the requirement of same-scanner labeled training data."}, {"section_title": "Comparison with other methods", "text": "We compared with multiple other methods for hippocampus segmentation: a multi-atlas registration with majority vote, atlas fusion by STAPLE (Warfield et al. (2004) ), and the patch-based atlas fusion method of . Majority vote and STAPLE make a decision based only on atlas information, while patch-based fusion methods, just like the used SVM classifier, incorporate appearance information, which overall performed better if appearance is similar. Patch-based atlas fusion outperformed the baseline SVM in case of small differences between train and test data, but decreased performance much more in case of large differences. We think patch-based atlas fusion is a better framework for atlas-based hippocampus segmentation than the baseline SVM, in case of training and test data from the same scanner, or when differences between images from different scanners are small. This can be explained by patch-based fusion makeing better use of the atlas information, by combining appearance information of every training sample (voxel) with the atlas prior of its image. The SVM combines the appearance information of training samples with the atlas prior of all images together. It therefore gives all atlases the same weight, while the patch-based fusion gives large weights only to the atlases with most similar appearance, which is beneficial if appearance is similar between train and test images. However, when appearance information is misleading, as in datasets with large differences between training and test data, patch-based fusion deteriorates more, because of this effect. We think that the presented FST can solve this problem, by transforming the representation of training samples to that of test samples. We also experimented with a poor man's implementation of such an FST for patch-based fusion, by transforming all training voxels in the feature space of the SVM FST, generating a transformed intensity image, and feeding this image into the patch-based fusion. This procedure greatly improved performance of patch-based fusion in the RSS dataset, but decreased performance on the HarP dataset. However, we think that performing an FST in the patch feature space used in patchbased fusion, rather than transforming only the intensity feature, would solve this problem. We namely showed for the SVM that transforming all features with the FST works much better than transforming only the training voxel's intensity."}, {"section_title": "Related work", "text": "Our approach is inspired by the patch-based image-synthesis techniques of e.g. Roy et al. (2011) ; Iglesias et al. (2013) , which aim to make the appearance of source images similar to that of a target scanning protocol. These methods extract source-target patches from source and target scans of the same subject and then adapt the intensities of a new image by splitting it up into patches and determining the closest source patch. In contrast, our FST performs a transformation in the higher-dimensional feature space that is used for the classification.\nRecently, methods have been developed to perform CT-MRI image synthesis with CycleGANs (Chartsias et al. (2017) ; Wolterink et al. (2017) ; Huo et al. (2018) ; Zhang et al. (2018) ). Here, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained that consists of two competing components, which are iteratively optimized: a generator, which transforms images from one modality to the other, and a discriminator, which discriminates between generated images and real images from the target modality. This way, image synthesis can be trained on unpaired source-target images. Since paired images are not always available, we think it would be very interesting to investigate the use of such methods for neuro-image segmentation across MRI scanners and modalities."}, {"section_title": "Features used for FST", "text": "We compared transforming all features to an FST on the intensity feature only, followed by calculation of the other features from the transformed intensity image. An FST on all features clearly outperformed FST on intensity alone, because image features derived for a transformed intensity image often appear quite different from the (nontransformed) features in the test data, due to e.g. noise.\nIn the experiments, we focused on only intensity and Gaussianscale-space features in cases where the same features are extracted for source and target data. However, the FST can also be applied to different features and to situations with differences between source and target features. We did not use spatial information in the FST, since this could result in only voxels around the hippocampus being used for the FST. We have in a preliminary stage experimented with learning the FST from the entire image or only from the ROI and found the former to give a much better FST, since it uses many more voxels. For segmentation purposes without a strong spatial prior, such as brain-tissue segmentation, it might be beneficial to include spatial features to help with possible spatial distortions that differ between train and test scanner, such as bias fields.\nAlso, unlabeled source-target images should be representative for the training data. Problems may arise if, training data contains tissues that are not observed in source-target data (such as tumors), for it would not be possible to learn the proper transformation. Lastly, there should be a one-to-one mapping between classes in source and target data in order to learn a good FST."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and future work", "text": "A limitation of the presented method is the requirement of samesubject images on both the training and the test scanner. In single-site studies such as the RSS (Ikram et al. (2015) ), rescans are often made in order to check for reproducibility and to eliminate scanning problems. For multi-site studies however, rescan data may not available. Applying the presented method to source-target images of different subjects is unlikely to work well, since the subjects' anatomy will be too different for many voxels to even have a corresponding voxel in the other image (when looking at all features). Investigating how to obtain an FST from images of different subjects would therefore be an interesting direction for further research. "}]
