In the broadest perspective, this quantitative study seeks to help stakeholders and policymakers understand the factors responsible for Hispanic 1 or Latino student achievement relative to that of comparison groups. The key dependent variables in this study are student achievement in reading and writing, and in math and science. Specifically, the Tom\u00e1s Rivera Policy Institute (TRPI) examines the impact on reading and writing, math and science achievement levels of computer use both at school and at home, and of teacher preparation for computerbased instruction. TRPI researchers analyzed the effects of these factors not only on comprehension of math and science, but also on reading and writing since research demonstrates that reading and writing ability facilitates understanding of math and science. Several studies have evaluated the relationship between computer use and academic achievement; however, these studies include a variety of limitations: being outdated; examining only math and not science achievement; lack of a control group; examining a limited sample; and a lack of focus on Latinos. Moreover, TRPI examines whether or not effects of race/ethnicity on achievement levels persist once confounding variables are controlled for. Along with computer usage, this study also investigates the effects of other explanatory criteria such as parental expectations, race/ethnicity, language spoken at home, mother's education, and poverty level. A comparative analysis for both the Latino and non-Latino samples was conducted. Additionally, the dataset is rich enough to allow the models TRPI analyzed to be controlled for selection bias by incorporating child and family characteristics including child's previous achievement (to control for ability). This study analyzes data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS) which provides a nationally-representative sample of over 11,000 fifth graders. While this study focuses on the overall sample of children across all races/ethnicities, it also attempts to discuss any implications of the findings on Hispanics. Significant findings of TRPI's analysis are as follows: (1) Once confounding variables are controlled for, the gaps in academic achievement between Hispanics/Latinos and their white counterparts disappear for reading and writing and math, and decrease for science achievement; (2) sufficiency of technical computer support provided to teachers has the most consistent positive effects on most scores; and (3) mother's education and parental expectations have consistently positive effects on scores."}, {"section_title": "objeCTives of The sTudy", "text": "The key dependent variables in this study are student achievement in reading and writing, and in math and science.

It is also important to recognize the important role teachers play in in-class instruction using computers, as well as teacher preparation and technical support. In 2003, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) released a study on patterns of computer use and academic achievement. However, the NCES determined that due to the weaknesses of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) dataset used as the basis for causal inference, even tentative conclusions about the relationship between achievement and computer use were not warranted. The NAEP data does not allow distinction in the direction of causality between computer use and achievement, nor does it allow analytic models to control for confounding variables, due to its insufficient background indicators. Moreover, the NAEP dataset was collected a decade or more ago (1996 and 1998). The 2003 NCES study does, however, provide an excellent review of literature, as discussed below. Studies show evidence of a positive correlation between computer use and academic achievement (Becker, 1994;Christmann and Badgett, 1999;Hativa, 1994;Kozma, 1991;Kulik and Kulik, 1987;Liao, 1992;Niemiec and Walberg, 1987;Niemiec and Walberg, 1992;Ryan, 1991;van Dusen and Worthen, 1994). In terms of subject-specific effects of computer use on achievement, results have generally supported significant positive effects of computer use on mathematics achievement (Clariana and Schultz, 1988;Mayes, 1992;Mevarich, 1994;Moore, 1988;Rhoads, 1986;van Dusen and Worthen, 1994). In contrast, using more recent data, Wenglinsky (1998) found that computer usage appeared to be negatively related to mathematics achievement in grades 4 and 8, after adjusting for socio-economic status and applying data from the 1996 NAEP dataset. However, the Wenglinsky study is problematic because it failed to consider race/ethnicity, frequency of computer use in classrooms, poverty-related student characteristics, or teacher preparation for computer use. The 2003 NCES study also notes that access to computers and the academic benefits that can be derived from computer use may not be the same for all students. While federally-funded programs often purchase computers to benefit disadvantaged students (Scott, Cole and Engel, 1992), computer access still differs across socioeconomic groups, as high-income and white students tend to have greater access than low-income and black students, and non-English speaking students tend to have the lowest level of computer access (Cuban, 1993;Neuman, 1991;Sutton, 1991). The \"digital divide\"-a term used to describe the gap between individuals with and without technology access-has certainly narrowed over the last decade; between 1994 and 1999 the proportion of schools with Internet access increased from 35 percent to 95 percent in the U.S. Similarly, the proportion of public school instructional classrooms with Internet access increased from 3 percent to 63 percent. However, schools in areas with high concentrations of poverty were much less likely to have Internet access; in 1999 less than half (39 percent) of instructional classrooms in schools in these areas were connected to the Internet. (May and Chubin, 2003) Therefore, low-income minority students, who are likely to attend these schools, are also more likely to have limited access to resources crucial for understanding science and mathematics, as well as access to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. The lack of computer and Internet resources in the 1990s may be one of the factors responsible for lower representation of low-income students majoring in STEM fields at colleges and universities in 2007. Revisiting the data paints a more hopeful picture: as of 2005, 100% of public schools access to computers and the academic benefits that can be derived from computer use may not be the same for all students. with minority enrollment of 50% or more had Internet access. Additionally, the ratio of public school students to instructional computers with Internet access was comparable for large-minority schools (4.1 students per computer) and low-minority schools (3.0 students per computer), according to the U.S. Department of Education, Fast Response Survey System, 2005. Several studies conducted in the 1980s indicated that even when studentto-computer ratios are comparable for both high-socio-economic status (SES) schools and low-SES schools, students in low-SES schools are more likely to use computers only for drill and practice exercises while their more affluent counterparts engage in more challenging activities (Cole and griffin, 1987;Kozma and Croninger, 1992;Watt, 1982). A number of quasi-experimental studies of the computer-achievement relationship for students of different abilities have also been conducted. The results from these analyses are mixed. Some studies show that even under the same treatment conditions, high-ability students receive greater benefits from learning via computer than their lower-ability classmates (Hativa, 1994;Hativa and Becker, 1994;Hativa and Shorer, 1989;Munger and Loyd, 1989;Osin, Nesher and Ram, 1994) while other studies indicate that high-and low-ability students attain similar gains (Becker, 1992;Clariana and Schultz, 1988). However, the results from longitudinal studies of computer-assisted instruction have prompted some researchers to conclude that computerized learning contributes to the increasing achievement gaps between high-and low-SES students and between high-and low-ability students (Hativa, 1994;Hativa and Becker, 1994;Hativa and Shorer, 1989). Finally, gender differences in achievement attained via computer-based instruction have been reported in some studies. Clariana and Schultz (1993) found that low-achieving eighth-grade females attained significantly smaller gains in mathematics, compared with high-and low-ability males and high-ability females, whereas in language arts, the low-ability females made the largest gains relative to the other three student groups. However, when ability is not taken into account, achievement gains for males tend to be significantly higher than the gains attained by their female classmates (Hativa and Shorer, 1989;Neuman, 1991). A significant factor discussed in the computer use and academic achievement literature is the vital function teachers play in implementing computer use in-class instruction (Clariana and Schultz, 1993;Hativa, 1994;Hativa and Becker, 1994;Moore, 1988;van Dusen and Worthen, 1994). Evidence from studies conducted in the 1980s and 1990s indicates that although teachers have had increasing access to computers for instruction, very few actually use them (NCES, 2003). The 2003 NCES analysis of data from the 1980s and 1990s indicates that in general, computer use is poorly integrated into the classroom curriculum and is under-used (Maddux, johnson, and Harlow, 1993;Becker, 1991;Ognibene and Stiele, 1990). Although it is apparent that teachers need to be trained in new technology, they also need to be trained to modify their teaching methods to take full advantage of the benefits offered by technology (Bright and Prohosch, 1995). Moreover, Sheingold and Hadly (1990) estimate that it takes at least five years for experienced teachers to become comfortable using computers in non-routine ways. students in lowses schools are more likely to use computers only for drill and practice exercises while their more affluent counterparts engage in more challenging activities."}, {"section_title": "The analyTiC sTraTegy", "text": "The outcomes of interest in this study are student achievement in reading, science, and math. The key independent variables are various indicators of computer use. This study also incorporates the confounding variables discussed in the literature review. These characteristics are included as explanatory variables in the models: the student's academic ability, gender, race/ethnicity, language spoken at home, parental expectations for the child, mother's education, whether or not mother is U.S.-born, poverty level, whether or not the child belongs to a two-parent family, and the number of hours spent watching television. A multivariate analysis was used, with explanatory variables incorporated into the model to test the validity of the relationship between academic achievement and computer use. The student's previous academic achievement was used to control for endogeneity effects, to ensure that it was computer use affecting scores, and not the other way around. The models were run for all students, and then separately for Hispanic students. Due to lack of statistical power as the sample drops for Hispanics, it is possible that our results do not show statistical significance for some correlations between academic achievement and independent variables."}, {"section_title": "The daTa", "text": "This study focuses on children in fifth grade. The dataset is nationally-representative, containing characteristics of 11,000 fifth-graders. The data was collected in 2004. The key dependent variable is academic achievement, as measured by the Academic Rating Scale (ARS), developed for the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 study (ECLS-K) to measure teachers' evaluations of students' academic achievement in three domains: language and literacy (reading and writing), science, and mathematical thinking. Teachers rated students' skills, knowledge, and behaviors on a scale from \"Not Yet\" (a low value of 1) to \"Proficient\" (a high value of 5). The scale corresponds to the 5-point rating that teachers used in rating children on key items. The ARS was designed to measure both the process and products of children's learning in school, as evaluated by the teacher. It is a criterion-referenced indirect measure targeted to the specific grade level of the student and drawn upon daily observations made by teachers of the students in their classes. The difficulties per item and student evaluations are placed on a common scale. Accordingly, students have a lower probability of receiving a high rating on items above their scale score and a high probability of receiving a high rating on items whose difficulty is below their scale score. Therefore, the ARS scores children receive should not be interpreted as mean scores, but as the child's relative probability of success with regard to the assessment items. While the data includes 11,000 children, the actual models are run on much less as data as some independent variables and explanatory variables are not available for all the children in the sample. academic disparities between traditionally underrepresented minority children and their white counterparts significantly decrease or disappear once the key independent variables and other confounding indicators in the models are accounted for."}, {"section_title": "findings and disCussion", "text": "In general, the multivariate results for the overall sample hold true for the Hispanic sample as well. Results from the overall sample showed that \"being Hispanic\" has no significant effect on reading and math scores, but has a negative effect on science scores after other confounding factors in the model have been accounted for. The models using the overall sample that includes all ethnicities/races shows results that have more statistical rigor than those for the model using only the Hispanic sample. The Hispanic sample is smaller in size, and its within-sample characteristics have less variation, thereby affecting the statistical results (or lack thereof). This is a potential explanation for why the models using the overall sample showed more significant relationships compared with the models using only the Hispanic sample."}, {"section_title": "Academic Disparities Can Be Explained by Factors Other Than Race/Ethnicity", "text": "It is interesting to note that the academic "}, {"section_title": "FiguRE 1", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ScoreS of blackS and HiSpanicS lag beHind wHiteS by a range of 12-35%", "text": "Notes: All results are statistically significant at 95% confidence level, except for Asian scores for science which are not significantly different from whites=0.

This should be explored further by school administrators in terms of the types of technical support that would most benefit classroom instruction. There is also a need to study how computer use is integrated, and can be better incorporated, into the curriculum. With the proliferation of computer games and home-based computers, there may very well be a digital divide between teachers and students, as well as between boys and girls. Both gaps merit further consideration.   Our results show positive correlations between teacher preparation, computer support for teacher, and computer use at school (math and science), as expected.

Meanwhile, there appears to be a positive correlation between a child's reading and writing scores and the teacher's satisfaction with the technical support for computer use provided by the school (Figure 6). If this relationship holds once confounding factors are controlled for, then policy should ensure teachers are given adequate technical support by schools when using computers for class instruction. In our sample, teachers of 70% of the students agree or strongly agree that they are satisfied with the technical support they are getting. Teachers of 17% of the students in our sample stated they were unsatisfied with provided technical support. increasing technical computer support for teachers in schools and classrooms may have a positive effect on test scores."}]
