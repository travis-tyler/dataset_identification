[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Question Answering or QA systems may be useful for the medical research community to stay up-to-date when new literature is rapidly growing. However, due to the lack of labeled question-answer pairs, developing accurate QA systems is challenging. Thus, one solution is to fine-tune pre-trained transformer-based QA systems 1 [1, 2, 3] .\nIn this paper, we propose three QA systems developed for the Kaggle COVID-19 Open Research Dataset, or CORD-19 dataset 2 . We built the QA systems after carefully reviewing various QA systems submitted to the CORD-19 Kaggle competition. We have also presented our preliminary results obtained from evaluating the performance of three transformers: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers or BERT [4] , ALBERT, and Text-to-text transfer transformer or T5 model on two new QA datasets -CovidQA and CovidGQA. Finally, we discuss the challenges of developing a high-performance QA system for COVID-19-related research and suggest solutions to improve performance."}, {"section_title": "A Review of QA Systems for the Kaggle CORD-19 Dataset", "text": "More than 1,000 teams participated in the Kaggle CORD-19 dataset competition.

Thus, for the CORD-19 Kaggle competition, various LDA-based QA systems were developed. For example, one approach 3 [9] combined the whoosh search engine and used Jensen-Shannon distance to discover topics related to What do we know about COVID-19 risk factors? and to find documents similar to those topics. Another interesting LDA-based QA 4 was proposed in [10] ; It combined k-means clustering and LDA to cluster documents and discover topics from clusters to facilitate extracting articles from the CORD-19 dataset. In [11] , a combination of LDA and Anserini (i.e., an open-source information retrieval approach) was proposed to develop a QA system that could find articles related to non-pharmaceutical intervention. The main aim of this work was to discover new interventions in specific environments by incorporating the context for each response in the search and guide policymakers to take appropriate actions to control spreading COVID-19 virus."}, {"section_title": "BERT-based QA systems for CORD-19", "text": "Since one of BERT's applications is in QA, different variations of BERT [12, 13, 14, 15] have been used. For the competition, many teams used BERT to develop QA systems [16, 17] . For instance, [16] used BERT to find relevant answers to keywords extracted from a question. The found solutions were ranked by Universal Sentence Encoder Semantic Similarity or USESS then Bayesian Additive Regression Trees or BART summarized the top results. Another team employed BERT as a semantic search engine to find answers. The QA system produced semantically meaningful sentence embedding on the paragraph extracted from the CORD-19 dataset and found five paragraphs and their corresponding papers' titles and abstracts. In [17] , the QA systems were based on A little BERT or ALBERT [14] to find answers for questions related to COVID-19."}, {"section_title": "Transformer-Based QA Systems", "text": "For the competition, we aimed to develop a QA system using a high performance Transformer. To do so, we developed three QA systems using BERT-large, ALBERT-base and Text-to-text transfer transformer or (T5)-large, pre-trained them on various QA datasets and evaluated them on two labeled questions answers datasets -CovidQA, and CovidGQA as described below."}, {"section_title": "Datasets for Pre-training Transformers", "text": "We use various datasets to pre-train our QA systems: 1) SQuAD v1.1 [18] -the Stanford Question Answering Dataset containing 100k question-answer pairs on more than 500 articles; 2) SNLI [19] -the Stanford Natural Language Inference corpus containing 570k human-written English sentence pairs manually labeled for balance classification with the labels entailment, contradiction and neutral; 3) MultiNLI [20] -the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference corpus containing 433k crowd-sourced sentence pairs with the same format as SNLI except it includes a more diverse range of text and a test set for cross-genre transfer evaluation; 4) STS -the Semantic Textual Similarity benchmark is a careful selection of data from English STS shared tasks (2012-2017) comprising of 8.6k annotated examples of text from image captions, news headlines, and user forums; and 5) BioASQ 5 -the question-answering biomedical dataset consists of 1k questions with \"exact\" and \"ideal\" answers. We specifically use BioASQ factoid QA pairs, excluding yes/no or list QA pairs, because the factoid dataset has a similar structure as SQuAD v1.1 [18] ."}, {"section_title": "Datasets for Evaluating Transformers", "text": "After pre-training our models, we evaluate our QA systems on CovidGQA and CovidQA.

The latter is a COVID-19 question-answering dataset built by hand from knowledge gathered from the Kaggle CORD-19 dataset [21] .

By leveraging extensive pre-training and transfer learning, it has achieved state-of-the-art performance on a variety of NLP benchmark tasks, including the GLUE benchmark [23] . Following work by [24] , which explores the task of generative closed-book question answering, we explore the efficacy of generating (rather than extracting) COVID-19 answers directly from an input question, without context. Unlike our preceding two approaches, the T5 model explores generation of answers to questions, without context. Using the pre-trained T5 model with 770M parameters released by [22] , we fine-tune for 25000 steps on an equal-proportions mixture of three QA tasks using the Natural Questions dataset, Trivia QA dataset and the train split of the COVID-19 QA dataset [25, 26] . Only the queries are given as input and answers are generated using simple greedy decoding. Evaluation is then performed on the test split of the COVID-19 dataset. We emphasize that these results are not directly comparable to the other frameworks, as the model is faced with the challenging task of jointly localizing relevant information and then generating a coherent answer. The advantage of such a framework is that it is context-free, meaning that it requires the least data preparation and human intervention."}, {"section_title": "Evaluation of QA Systems", "text": "We evaluate the above transformers using two datasets -CovidQA and CovidGQA. Using the same evaluation metrics as SQuAD v1.1, we calculate the macro-averaged F1 score and Exact Match or EM of the answer extraction methods of our QA systems on each dataset. Both BERT-large-uncased and ALBERT-base-uncased use whole word masking and are pre-trained on SQuAD v1.1, while T5-large was pre-trained on Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus or C4. Figure  1 shows the comparison of generated answer lengths on the CovidGQA dataset. BERT-large achieves the highest macro-averaged F1 score on both datasets. Furthermore, BERT-large outperforms ALBERT-base on GLUE, RACE, and SQuAD benchmarks [14] . However, ALBERT-base unexpectedly outperforms BERT-large on EM, achieving the highest EM of the three models. Further experimentation is required to investigate the cause of this. Despite T5-large having the most significant number of parameters (770M), both BERT-large and ALBERT-base outperform T5-large on all metrics on both datasets. This may be explained by the fact that T5-large was not pre-trained on a QA task. The reasonable performance of these three transformers, motivated us to use them to develop QA systems for the CORD-19 Kaggle competition. The next section discusses the QA systems in more detail. "}, {"section_title": "QA Systems for COVID-19", "text": "Based on the results showed in the previous section, we have developed two QA systems on the CORD-19 dataset which aim to help the medical community answer high-priority scientific questions such as \"What is the efficacy of novel therapeutics being tested currently?\" or \"What is the best method to combat the hypercoagulable state seen in COVID-19?\". We designed two BERT-based question-answering systems and a T5 question-answering system. Each QA system is pre-trained on different datasets and evaluated on two COVID-19 datasets."}, {"section_title": "SBERT-BERT-QA", "text": "The SBERT-BERT-QA system (see Figure 2 8 ) combines Sentence-BERT and BERT-large. We first filter the articles using a keyword search based on a set of pre-defined keywords such as RNA virus, clinical, naproxen, clarithromycin. Once filtered, the top n articles were extracted by embedding the query and the article titles using a pre-trained Sentence-BERT model (i.e., a BERT-base model with mean-tokens trained on SNLI and MultiNLI corpora and then on STS Benchmark training set) [27] . Sentence-BERT (SBERT) is a modification of the BERT network using Siamese and triplet network structures to derive semantically meaningful sentence embeddings. The top n articles were extracted by taking the articles with the highest cosine similarity scores between the query embedding and each article title embedding. Once the top article were extracted, each article's answer to the query was extracted using a pre-trained QA BERT-large-uncased model."}, {"section_title": "LDA-ALBERT-QA", "text": "The LDA-ALBERT-QA (see Figure 2 9 ) combines LDA and pre-trained ALBERT-base. First, we filter out the irrelevant articles from the CORD-19 dataset using LDA to provide a dataset containing only the relevant articles to the query. Then, the filtered documents are fed into a pre-trained QA ALBERT-base-uncased model to extract an excerpt from articles that are relevant to the query. We have utilized SQuAD v1.1 [18] and BioASQ 6b factoid QA pairs to develop the pre-trained ALBERT model. The primary reason for using SQuAD v1.1 is to overcome the data shortage of BioASQ 6b factoid, which contains less than 1k QA pairs. After pre-training the model on SQuAD v1.1, we further pre-train the model with BioASQ dataset to target biomedical domain. A single output layer on top of the pre-trained ALBERT model performs token-level classification to compute the start/end index of a predicted answer from each article."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "We presented two transformer-based QA systems to compete in the competition. We selected transformers based on the preliminary results obtained from BERT, ALBERT, and T5 model on two QA datasets. As our results indicated, BERT-large could achieve the highest F1-score for both datasets and one of our first candidates to develop a QA system. Our results also showed that ALBERT-base could achieve the highest EM score for both datasets and was our second nominee to establish a QA system. We consider that one of the significant limitations of transformers is that they require Figure 3 : Context-free T5 QA system a lot of labeled QA pairs to reach acceptable performance. We aimed to resolve the limitation by developing a hybrid QA system that combines few-shot learning with a transformer. LDA also has some limitations; for example, we need to determine the number of topics and consider the articles that are not too short. To address these issues, we explore prediction-focused supervised LDA and identify topics in an online manner. Furthermore, a QA system should be explainable and trustworthy to medical users. Developing such a QA system is possible if medical experts and NLP researchers cooperate closely."}, {"section_title": "Author's contributions", "text": "The first three authors equally worked with technical parts of the paper that has been summarized in Section 3 and 4.
