[{"section_title": "", "text": "As stated by Shameer and colleagues (2017) , \"monitoring and modeling biomedical, health care and wellness data from individuals and converging data on a population scale have tremendous potential to improve understanding of the transition to the healthy state of human physiology to disease setting\" (p.105). Shameer et al. (2017) have reviewed translational bioinformatics methods, tools, and resources, and provide an excellent summary of health-monitoring devices and their application to individualized diagnostics, prognosis, and clinical or wellness interventions. The opportunities they envision are advances in real-time biomedical and healthcare analytics in the clinical setting that will be driven by technologies that monitor, store, remotely transmit, analyze, and display everyday physiological and behavioral data in both healthy and disease states. A broad goal of these technologies is to obtain longitudinal measures in natural settings. \"Big Data\" analytics applied to masses of streamed sensor data and electronic health records are important tools for effectively realizing the opportunities presented by new monitoring technologies. The applications discussed extend well beyond existing telemedicine functions, in which clinical interactions and physiological and behavioral data traditionally accrued in clinical settings are gathered instead at significant distances using remote sensing.\nThe challenges to linking data elements gathered from the same individual during both healthy and diseased states fall into two broad categories: (1) those common to any analysis of longitudinal measures taken on the same person over time; and (2) those unique to contemporary efforts to link multiple data sources gathered across home and clinical settings. The ever-increasing possibilities for linking healthy and diseased states summarized by Shameer and colleagues (2017) necessarily inherit longstanding challenges to repeated collection of longitudinal data from the same individuals. The scope of contemporary efforts compounds the complexity of known challenges, while creating new issues deriving from the technologies themselves. The following sections delineate these research challenges."}, {"section_title": "The Challenges of Conducting Longitudinal Research", "text": "While technology developments have increased the opportunities for obtaining longitudinal data on human subjects, they do not materially change the challenges inherent to conducting longitudinal research. The major scientific challenges of longitudinal research are related to obtaining suitable participants whose serial assessments are of consistent quality and interpretable with minimal ambiguity. A few examples from longitudinal studies initiated in the 20 th century are illustrative. Serial assessments of physical and psychological development in children, adolescents, and young adulthood provide normative developmental benchmarks in scientific literature consulted by scientists and pediatricians to differentiate normal and disease-related variations in physiological function and behavior.\nThe major 20 th century U.S. longitudinal studies fell into two broad categories: those focusing on longitudinal assessments related to specific disease syndromes and those that assessed a wide variety of functions both to describe normal or usual aging as well as denoting agerelated functional and physiological changes potentially giving rise to disease syndromes. The consummate examples of large-scale longitudinal studies focusing on disease syndromes include the Framingham Heart Study (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute & Boston University, 2017), in which three successive generations of volunteer residents of Framingham, Massachusetts, received repeated yearly assessments of cardiac function and blood chemistry related to heart disease concurrent to routine physical examinations. Similar studies of developing cardiac disease risk factors in adolescents were carried out in the Bogalusa Heart Study (Tulane Center for Lifespan Epidemiology Research, 2017) . These ongoing studies use physiological assessments and gathered questionnaire data concerning tobacco and alcohol use and dietary and exercise behaviors of the participants. In these studies, dedicated research facilities were established in the town of Framingham and at sites near schools in Bogalusa, Louisiana.\nTwo U.S. examples of ongoing longitudinal studies of normal aging are the National Institute on Aging's Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (2017; BLSA), started in 1958, and the US Department of Veterans Affairs' Normative Aging Study (Maelstrom Research, 2017; NAS) , started in Boston in 1963. In both, volunteers arrived at dedicated test sites; the Boston site is easily accessible by public transit. NAS volunteers went for 3-4 hour assessments on a few occasions over a 3-5 year cycle. In contrast, the BLSA volunteers stayed at a dedicated hotel-style facility for approximately two days, where they underwent various physiological and psychological assessments. In addition to a variety of medically oriented measurements, the BLSA participants underwent assessments of bone density, muscle strength, vision, and hearing, and extensive cognitive and personality evaluations.\nMajor procedural issues bedevil ambitious researchers who plan to acquire longitudinal big data using multiple sensors, and these include: (1) selecting and retaining research participants; (2) technological changes in measurement apparatus, procedures, and criteria for evaluating data occurring midstream in the investigation; and (3) comparability of the aging process across birth cohorts (e.g., aging from 40 years to 50 in the mid 20 th century differs substantially from doing so in the year 2000)."}, {"section_title": "Participant Selection and Retention Issues", "text": "The Framingham Heart Study recruited volunteers from among the town's residents and the incentives included free medical evaluations and advice, but not treatment. As the reputation of the study spread, subjects recruited neighborhood friends and relatives who also took great pride in participating in a famous study. The Normative Aging Study and the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging both relied upon these same incentives; financial compensation to attract participants was never used, although free meals and lodging were provided to participants in the BLSA. Feedback of results to participants via newsletters seminars, videos, etc. was widely employed to maintain motivation.\nParticipants in all three studies were self-selected; in the Normative Aging Study, volunteers were admitted who met initial screening requirements for blood pressure and other medical criteria. The closed panel study included roughly equal numbers of blue-and white-collar men. Initially the BLSA had no formal admission requirements, but since incorporated an initial health screen. Male and female volunteers were drawn from large waiting lists according to a research design requiring equal numbers in each cohort with at least 12 years' participation. None of these studies excluded participants once they joined.\nThe use of self-selected volunteers has drawn criticism, particularly in the case of the BLSA. The initial BLSA volunteers were retired scientists and professors from upper socioeconomic neighborhoods who recruited younger friends and relatives; the first female volunteers were spouses and daughters of the original male volunteers. When the percentage of African-American participants increased from 4 to 14%, it was the direct result of existing African-American participants leading the recruitment drives. In the BLSA, education levels were explored for their relevance as covariates in studies of cognitive aging, but not in other areas of study. Any new longitudinal studies employing remote health monitoring must first answer the question, whose aging is being assessed?"}, {"section_title": "Secular Changes in Equipment, Procedures, and Criteria for Evaluating Data", "text": "The BLSA provides good examples of the impact of these three unique sources of variance on research outcomes. Because of improvements in measurement apparatus and methods, BLSA strength assessment procedures were modified no fewer than three times between 1958 and 1996. Over a 35-year period, spirograms were obtained using the same type of spirometer, but the criteria for interpreting pulmonary functional assessments changed four times over that interval. To report the results using the current criteria some 9000 paper archival records were digitized for reanalysis by retracing them with an electronic pen (Tockman et al., 1995; Pearson et al., 1998) . The original classification of diseases in the BLSA preceded the International Classification of Diseases' standards and customized software was required to update the information to the new standard."}, {"section_title": "Birth Cohort Effects", "text": "In the Normative Aging Study the cohort participants were all selected within a 5-year period; comparisons of age changes related to birth cohort were therefore relatively limited. In the Framingham study, birth cohort effects were evaluated by studying the original participants' children (Generation 2), sons-and daughters-in-law (Generation 2), and grandchildren (Generation 3).\nThe Seattle Longitudinal Study (University of Washington, 2017) specifically evaluated cohort effects related to participation time; measures of cognitive function were administered every seven years. At the same time the measures were re-administered to returning participants, age-matched first-time volunteers' data were included. This procedure allowed evaluation of practice and adaptation effects in returning volunteers and allowed evaluation of differences in educational experiences that affect performance on the assessments.\nTo summarize, future longitudinal studies of health/disease relationships must address the aforementioned issues to ensure their validity. The rapid evolution of wearable sensors and remote monitoring are further challenging the measurement standards. All of the examples described above controlled the evaluation of the testing more precisely than many prior efforts.\nThe diversity and complexity of wearable monitoring devices raise concerns about the compatibility of movement speed and distance, fall detection, and behavioral measures obtained using different methods. A considerable body of engineering literature describes varied technologies at the proof-of-concept stage that can successfully measure an event. The applications may use proprietary software that prohibit the comparison of measures of walking speed, for example, obtained by two or more devices, since the algorithms that generated the measures may be publicly unavailable due to intellectual property restrictions. As a case in point, consider a speed measure derived from a real-time location system in which the data stream never stops because the body-worn transmitter never truly stops moving. What is the rule that determines when walking has begun versus what is just random noise of the transmitter? Is a velocity of zero a valid speed to be gathered along with all other speeds? If so, the distribution of movement speeds for the subject will be very positively skewed and the mean speed will be quite low. In contrast, if low speed values are deliberately filtered out, a very different movement profile may emerge that fails to show that the person may be sedentary for over 90% of her day. Which is correct?"}, {"section_title": "Recent and Current Efforts Linking Everyday Activities to Medical Problems and Accidents", "text": "Kutzik (2017) summarizes several programs for behavioral monitoring in the home. He concludes that the major problem relating monitored everyday behavior to medical problems is in determining how the monitored data are to be used. He cites the example of an application of a commercially available system, Quiet Care, in which a nurse was required to review the records of the monitored persons in her caseload daily. She telephoned the monitored person or included the person in her daily round of visits. The difficulty of the nurses' jobs increased because large amount of superfluous information in daily machine-generated records of the monitored person added little data of benefit.\nMonitoring everyday activities in the home involves detecting and measuring time spent in different household locations. Commonly identified locations include bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens, and eating areas. The monitoring system's spatiotemporal resolution is a key factor affecting data accuracy: the type, number, and placement of sensors can influence this, as can the type of signal processing involved. On the low end of the resolution continuum, Pavel and colleagues (2007) adapted inexpensive Passive Infrared security system technology to estimate walking speed in the homes of subjects with Parkinson's disease by mounting down-facing Passive Infrared arrays on the subjects' ceilings and coupling the data stream to analytic programs running hidden Markov models. Alone, the Passive Infrared technology was unable to distinguish among residents, so wearable Radio Frequency Identification Devices were used to identify them. Pavel et al.'s (2007) work exemplifies the advantages and the limitations of adapting relatively simple technologies to perform the significantly more complex tasks of accurately estimating location and movement.\nSince the work of Pavel et al. (2007) , more complex technologies involving body-worn accelerometers and pervasive location-sensing devices have evolved. Kearns and Fozard (2013) reviewed engineering reports of experimental fall detection systems, some of which were designed to gather movement and location information. Philips Healthcare, Inc. now markets a fall detection device that automatically sends text messages to a caregiver if the faller is unable to signal on their own due to unconsciousness. Earlier versions of the technology demanded the faller remain conscious in order to signal for help. Kearns, Fozard, and Nams (2016) employed an UltraWideband Real Time Location System manufactured by Ubisense, Inc. to accurately locate the wearer of a small transponder tag that sent signals to a set of sensors that estimated transponder location in three spatial planes using the tag signal's time delay of arrival and angle of arrival. The system's location error averaged 20 cm in 3D and positional accuracy was related to the number of sensors receiving the signal and the position sampling frequency, which was 2 Hz. The locations of the tags were measured in 3D in cm relative to an origin inside the building, and the relative x, y, and z (altitude) of the tag were processed in real-time by a fractal dimension software program that calculated deviations from a straight-line trajectory. Fractal dimension ranges from 1.0 when the tag moves in a perfectly straight line to 2.0 when the tag's movement path is entirely chaotic, or resembles a \"drunkard's walk.\" Thus any individual's wearable tag moving through space can be evaluated, and most cognitively unimpaired individuals' tags produce values of 1.27 or less. Voluntary movements of residents through a common atrium area of an assisted living facility were measured in several studies . The major findings were that fractal dimension was significantly related to poorer performance on the Mini Mental State Exam, and predicted clinical diagnoses of dementia with greater accuracy than the Exam. In a yearlong study of the precursors to falls in assisted living facility residents, it was found the fallers had elevated fractal dimension one week before a movement-related fall. Other investigators have shown that fractal dimension is correlated to the classical patterns of wandering-lapping, pacing, and random movement (Kumar, Lau, Chan, Ma, & Kearns, 2016) . In contrast to the work by Pavel, Hayes, and colleagues (Pavel, Hayes, Adami, Jimison, & Kaye, 2006) , the Real Time Location System system used by Kearns and colleagues in their investigations provides highly accurate location estimates up to 100 Hz and can monitor up to 100 people simultaneously in addition to generating big data; in Kearns et al.'s (2012) longitudinal falls study, well over 43 million records were generated by just 53 subjects over one year. Kearns' technology was considerably more granular (and expensive) than the Passive Infrared system used by Pavel et al. (2007) , but Kearns' approach benefits from economies of scale when applied to monitoring large numbers of individuals in congregate living facilities.\nOne of the most comprehensive programs linking machine-based functional activity monitoring to disease development is underway at the University of Missouri (Tyrer, Aud, Alexander, Skubic, & Rantz, 2007) . The program evolved from early findings (Rantz et al., 2005 ) that, with nursing-coordinated automated home care, aging in place was an affordable alternative to nursing home and assisted living facilities for many seniors with chronic medical conditions. The current realization of their efforts is Tiger Place: a sensor-laced apartment complex designed for residents over 65. The average resident is approximately 86 years of age, and most live singly. Since its construction, length of stay has increased from about 28 to 32 months, and about 40% reside in the apartments until their demise. Tiger Place is similar to upscale continuing care communities, offering a gymnasium, swimming pool, facilities for social and educational activities, and regular meals. A program of home-based care developed for the community at large is provided to the residents, augmented by pervasive monitoring employing a mix of sensors and machine vision systems to detect falls, summon assistance, and safeguard the residents. Unlike most continuing care facilities, residents do not pay an admission charge; the costs are included in the rent. Rantz and colleagues (2015) have indicated the cost of residing in Tiger Place falls between that of an assisted living facility and a nursing home.\nReports of ongoing research and intervention activities have been presented by Rantz and colleagues (2013; 2015) . Sensors deployed in various zones in Tiger Place residences yield activity-density maps showing time spent in various areas of the room. There is also a bed sensor that provides measures of respiration, pulse, and restlessness. Declines in activity over time are correlated with various outcomes-falls, hospitalizations, etc. The authors noted that the change in activity associated with adverse events is about two weeks. In a later summary, Rantz and colleagues (2015) reported on the beneficial effects of the technology in the independent living apartments of Tiger Place residents. Residents who did not have technology had an average length of stay of 2.6 years; those with sensor technology installed almost doubled that, at 4.3 years. The two groups were comparable in age and health at time of admission.\nRantz's team (Phillips et al., 2016) reported that unobtrusive sensor monitoring of walking and falls by residents in independent living apartments yielded 66 terabytes of data gathered over a 10-year interval. Their Kinect-based machine vision system estimates walking speed, stride length, stride time variability, and other gait parameters; machine vision data are converted to silhouettes to preclude subject identification and ensure privacy. Thirteen fallers and 10 non-fallers had their gait speed and stride length evaluated from a total of 2,070 events and investigators found cumulative speed change was associated with an increased likelihood of a fall. A decline of 2.54 cm/s was associated with a 4.22 times greater likelihood of falling within three weeks.\nThe progress at Tiger Place was related to several highly controlled factors: the nurse-coordinated home health care was the same for all; Tiger Place apartments are similar, so activity measures were comparable across residents; a customized electronic health record facilitated the linking of functional and medical data; there was a pool of willing participants in the facility; and highly-qualified researchers took full advantage of the resources offered by the program and facility."}, {"section_title": "Discussion and Conclusion", "text": "The Tiger Place story comes closest to meeting the two major challenges to linking longitudinal information on everyday activities to clinical data on disease. With respect to the challenges of conducting longitudinal research, the program deals well with the issues of subject selection (nurse-coordinated home health care was the same for all participants who were in the program) and problems associated with secular change (birth cohort effects and environmental changes were controlled). The second major challenge, linking everyday activity to disease, was met by measuring activity in a defined area that was similar across Tiger Place apartments, and by careful laboratory vetting and cross validation of the activity measures, e.g., alternate measures of movement speed by the Doppler radar and Kinect technologies.\nThe programs reviewed reveal the possible dangers of self deception associated with big data: controlling Type 1 errors and method variance at the time of data acquisition. The latter were exemplified by secular changes in measurements of cholesterol, pulmonary function, and blood sugar in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (National Institute on Aging, 2017). Another common example is the failure to adjust blood pressure cuff size for serial measurements-arm diameter increases over the adult life span without a corresponding increase in cuff size can result in spurious elevations in blood pressure readings.\nRegarding the control of sources of error, one might see parallels between the use of observational techniques to study multiple variables using individually calculated Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficients, transitioning to Primary Component Analysis and Factor Analysis, and eventually moving to big data modeling. However, is big data a sample or, because of its sheer volume and extent, does it begin to constitute a true population measure? If the data is so extensive that it constitutes the latter, then statistically significant results may be of trivial clinical significance because the test is vastly overpowered, and the mean values are themselves the population demographic.\nThe next major issue concerns sampling frequency-big data samples (or population estimates) may be drawn once or repeatedly. Yet, if they're drawn repeatedly, what is the appropriate method for determining if the observed change differs reliably from chance? There may be few or no statistical approaches that handle repeated measures in the case of extremely large N time series across hundreds of persons. What are the best methods of performing power analysis calculations in terms of sample size? Institutional review board requirements may limit sample size in order to reduce the burden upon subjects, but in some instances the subject burden is inconsequential because the data is archival, or was collected in the background by pervasive monitoring and so imposes little or no perceptible burden on the subjects.\nFinally, in big data there may be no theoretical model driving the research protocol; the goal may be to derive a model from the data, which is considered a close approximation of a population estimate-an empirically driven approach that is atheoretical. Such approaches have been criticized as \"fishing expeditions\" by some methodologists who consider the procedure as capitalizing on chance factors and not capable of generating trustworthy results. The landscape is changing significantly, however, as new methods and research protocols are being developed in research facilities around the globe to address these challenging issues."}]
