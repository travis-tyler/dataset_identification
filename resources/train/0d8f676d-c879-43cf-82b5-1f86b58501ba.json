[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "For many years, the Linguistic Society of America (LSA) has maintained a Directory of Linguistics Departments and Programs, which has included primarily academic institutions located in the United States and Canada. The print Directory was a well-regarded resource for tracking basic information such as language and sub-field specializations, student enrollment, number and type of degrees conferred, number and rank of faculty positions, and related demographic data for students and faculty. As the Directory evolved into an online resource, it became more difficult to produce an Annual Report with comprehensive information for all of the North American institutions because fewer departments and programs provided data to the LSA. A primary objective of the 2012 LSA website redesign was to develop a much more robust Directory of Linguistics Departments and Programs. This redesigned Directory would serve a number of potential audiences: prospective graduate students, prospective faculty, and administrators seeking benchmarking data. With this overhaul complete, the LSA then embarked on extensive outreach efforts to enlist the participation of \"departmental contacts\" in order to update the listings for individual institutions. For the 2017 Report, there was a small decrease in the number of reporting institutions from 2016. However, this is likely due to the 2016 survey work of the Committee on the Status of Women in Linguistics, which collected new data on gender demographics at participating institutions. The list of participating institutions for the 2017 report is located in the Appendix. The LSA has also monitored and/or participated in a number of national (U.S.) surveys that track the status of linguistics in higher education. The National Science Foundation (NSF) reports data from two relevant surveys: The Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) and the Survey of Doctoral Recipients. The federal Department of Education conducts and reports data from an annual survey of ~4,200 postsecondary institutions. The most recent available data from all three of these surveys are included in this report, with new data expected in mid-2018. In addition to these federal data initiatives, the American Academy of Arts & Sciences conducted a Humanities Departmental Survey (HDS), with financial and inkind support from the LSA, in 2007-8 and 2012-13. The 2012-13 HDS was published in 2014 and select elements of data covering the field of linguistics in higher education appear in this report. The report also contains 2014 data from the 2017 NSF report on Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering. In addition to the data collection and monitoring activities outlined above, the LSA maintains a member database with individual profiles that include demographic information, professional affiliations, and linguistic sub-specialties. Although most LSA members do not choose to provide demographic information, most do choose to provide professional and/or scholarly affiliations. Charts summarizing statistically relevant data from the LSA membership profiles are included in this report. This year, the LSA also has preliminary data from a survey of LGBTQ+ linguists conducted as part of the organization procedures for an up-and-coming Special Interest Group on LGBTQ+ Issues in Linguistics which provides data on gender expression, sexuality, and transgender identity in the linguistics community. The long-term goal of the LSA has been to compile data from all of the relevant sources mentioned above and incorporate them into longitudinal charts showing change over time in the academic linguistics community. This year, the LSA is proud to present the first of its longitudinal charts for the first five years of the Annual Report, 2013-2017, alongside the 2017 statistics. The LSA also welcomes the opportunity to report on trends affecting linguists beyond academia, including those working in The State of Linguistics in Higher Education Annual Report 2017 Page 5 The Linguistic Society of America industry and government. Obtaining data for these populations is much more difficult, given the lack of systems in place for tracking these individuals and the lack of financial resources for creating such complex systems. LSA data on the number of degrees awarded by reporting institutions ( Figure 15B) shows an increase in the number of awarded Bachelor's degrees between 2013 and 2017 but doesn't see that trend replicated in the number of awarded Master's degrees and PhDs. The assumption is that many linguists begin working in industries or areas of government after receiving their Bachelor's."}, {"section_title": "Overview of Trends in Linguistics", "text": "The most common career outcome for linguistics PhDs is a position in higher education. There are, however, a significant number of linguists pursuing careers in industry and K-14 education after obtaining their doctorates. Within higher education, departments report that most members of their faculty are full professors, but the non-professorial category is growing, particularly for women in other full-time positions. Additionally, women are almost on parity with men for tenure-track 1 jobs, but still fall below men in the number of full professor positions. The field of linguistics is growing most rapidly for undergraduates, with an increase of approximately 120 more students awarded BA degrees annually for the past 14 years; although in recent years, the number of awarded Bachelor's has increased at a slower rate. Most linguistics undergraduate degrees are awarded to women. Women represent over half of graduate students in linguistics, a number which has been increasing over the last 50 years, while women comprise 57 percent of the undergraduate population, surpassing the amount of male undergraduate recipients. Beginning in 2015 the number of female PhD awardees dropped while men increased, according to the NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates (see Figure 17). However, the LSA's departmental data for 2017 shows the opposite pattern, with an increase in PhD production for women and level for men (see Figure 18). More linguistics degrees, including Bachelor's, Master's, and PhDs, are awarded to White or Caucasian recipients than any other ethnicity. White degree awardees are followed by 1) Hispanic or Latino, 2) Asian, 3) Other or unknown race or ethnicity, 4) Two or more races, 5) Black or African American, 6) American Indian or Alaska Native, and 7) Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (see Figure 18A) Data Sources"}, {"section_title": "LSA Directory", "text": "Data found in this report come from a variety of sources. Information about departments and programs is self-reported in the LSA's online Directory, found at www.linguisticsociety.org/programs. Since the upgraded directory was redesigned in 2013, 248 out of 250 departments/programs provided updates to their profiles. The Directory was also updated in 2016 to include new fields with postal addresses so members may search programs by state or country. Calculations of numbers of job titles, students, degrees awarded, and average salaries are only from departments that have registered and submitted data about their students or faculty to the online directory in 2017 (100 departments, or under half of all registered departments). Almost half of those responding offer the PhD as their highest degree (105 of the 250 registered departments that reported that information). Since not all departments submitted data in every area, each graph in the following report is a representation of the departments that have reported data in that realm (77 departments for job types, 70 for current students, 43 for degrees awarded, and 7 for salaries). The graph on graduate specializations was compiled from only those programs for which their specializations are reported on their directory page (250 programs). Data on ethnicity of faculty and student populations is collected via the Directory, but only 20 institutions provided such data.

Data for Student Members (n=1228) are handled separately (within the tables on ethnicity, citizenship, and year in school). The charts do not include data for lapsed regular and/or student members (n=11,975).

The raw numbers below in Figure 4A show data from all reported departments. Figure 4B shows longitudinal data from 2013-2017 about overall percentage of job titles. For the total number of tenure track positions for data reported in 2017 (N=1101), there was a 189.7% increase in number from data reported in 2013 (N=380). However, this likely represents an increase in reporting institutions.   The average number for each category type in data from reporting institutions (see figure 5A) indicates a similar trend to what is presented in Figures 4A and 4B. Full Professors and Associate Professors on average make up a larger part of reporting departments, with Assistant Professors averaging only slightly more than Other Full-Time positions per department. The five year data for averages by position for reporting departments is presented in Figure 5B, below. The large dip in averages by department in 2015 and 2016 is due to changes in the total number of reporting departments and data collection.    Figure 6A showcases the LSA Members who have listed their job title in the membership database, so the pattern cannot directly be compared. However, the pattern in tenure-track positions from Figure 4A is observed in Figure 6A, with Full Professors having the highest number of job titles.

There are also on average more women in \"Other Part-Time\" and \"Associate Professor\" positions for 2017. However, women have never in the past five years averaged more \"Full Professor\" positions than men in the Directory data (see figure 10). This is despite the fact that from 2013 to 2017 women have always averaged higher than men in total number of positions (see figure 11). The two pie charts in Figure 9 below show the comparison of job titles in percentage by gender. There were 77 departments that reported on employment this year (down from 91 departments in 2016, which resulted from the COSWL survey that year). Of those reporting, there were 218 male full professors and 173 female full professors for a total of 391 full professors at 77 departments.

In comparison, the NSF data features more Mixed/Other, Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander awardees than the ethnic selfidentification reflected in the LSA member database.
