Interhemispheric hippocampal connectivity was decreased in the 3xTg-AD while connectivity in the caudate putamen (CPu) was similar to controls. Most surprising, ventricular volume in the 3xTg-AD was four times larger than controls.

Despite AD accounting for around 67% of dementia cases and estimations indicating that around 8.4% of the population at 65 years of age suffer from AD (Alloul et al., 1998) , there exists no effective diagnostic biomarker that can detect the prodromal features of AD before the emergence of cognitive alterations (Cavedo et al., 2014) . Recent efforts including the AD neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) have propelled forward the drive to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to find biomarkers of AD progression (Weiner et al., 2015 (Weiner et al., , 2017 . Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has demonstrated increased medial diffusivity (MD) associated with the hippocampus and gray matter (GM) atrophy in AD patients (Oishi et al., 2011) . A meta-analysis of DTI studies found that fractional anisotropy (FA) was decreased in AD in all regions except the parietal white matter (WM) and internal capsule (Sexton et al., 2011) . Before the late pathological stage, some MRI changes have been found in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) which represents an intermediate stage before AD development. These changes include increased MD in WM and GM (Jahng et al., 2011; Gyebn\u00e1r et al., 2018) and a reduction in FA (Gyebn\u00e1r et al., 2018) . In addition to DTI metrics, functional measures (Weiner et al., 2015) such as resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) have demonstrated decreased functional connectivity (FC) in AD patients vs. controls (Dennis and Thompson, 2014; Teipel et al., 2017) . The resting state MRI data indicate that at a later stage of AD several functional changes can be detected using MRI. Nevertheless, there still is a lack of knowledge regarding the preclinical or prodromal changes that precede the beginning of AD.\nOne way to address this problem is using animal models. One of the most studied animal model of AD is the triple transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD) harboring presenilin 1 (PS1; M146V), amyloid precursor protein (APP; Swe), and tau(P301L) transgenes that progressively develops the pathology associated with human AD (Oddo et al., 2003) . The alterations present in the 3xTg-AD mice include amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) deposition that precedes tangle formation, synaptic and cholinergic degeneration deficits (Perez et al., 2011) , intraneuronal A\u03b2 accumulation and cognitive decline particularly in long term memory (Bittner et al., 2010) . Some MRI studies have found contradictory results regarding MRI changes in 3xTg-AD mice. In one study, the 3xTg-AD does not develop MRI detectable changes in late-life (11-17 months; Kastyak-Ibrahim et al., 2013) , but in another study of an overlapping age range (12-14 months) the 3xTg-AD developed decreases in FA and axial diffusivity (AD \u03bb//; Snow et al., 2017) . Nevertheless, recent evidence indicates that the 3xTg-AD displays early changes in neuronal network and synaptic function, before the appearance of cognitive and physiological alterations (Chakroborty et al., 2012; Gatta et al., 2014; Kazim et al., 2017) . These combined attributes make the 3xTg an elegant model to study the prodromal symptomology associated with AD.\nThe objective for the present study was to measure DTI indices and rsfMRI FC in the 3xTg-AD mouse model. Based on previous reports we decided to investigate 2-month-old 3xTg-AD mice as they are cognitively normal (Oddo et al., 2003) . Here A\u03b2 deposition has not altered hippocampal functioning and the animals do not display long term memory alterations (Sterniczuk et al., 2010) . We expected based on previous research that DTI and rsfMRI changes would be relatively minimal since the neuropathology at this stage is minimal. Contrary to our assumption, a significant decrease in radial diffusivity (RD \u03bb\u22a5) and a significant increase in FA were found in the cortex compared with age-matched wild type controls. Furthermore, significant ventricular enlargement was observed in the 3xTg-AD. The interhemispheric FC was significantly reduced in the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice compared with controls. Here we demonstrate the 3xTg-AD mouse model develops MRI detectable changes prior to reported cognitive and pathophysiological alterations."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Animals Preparation", "text": "Animals were prepared for MRI experiments as described in our earlier studies (Lau et al., 2011 (Lau et al., , 2015a Cheung et al., 2012a,b; Abdoli et al., 2016; Wong et al., 2017 (Carroll et al., 2007 (Carroll et al., , 2010a Hirata-Fukae et al., 2008) .

The animals were initially anesthetized with 3% isoflurane. When sufficiently anesthetized, 1-2 drops of 2% lidocaine were applied to the chords to provide local anesthesia before the endotracheal intubation. The animals were mechanically ventilated at a rate of 54-56 min \u22121 with 1% isoflurane in room-temperature air using a ventilator (TOPO, Kent Scientific Corp., Torrington, CT, USA). During MRI, the animals were placed on a plastic cradle with the head fixed using a tooth bar and plastic screws in the ear canals. Body temperature was maintained using a water circulation system with rectal temperature \u223c37.0 \u2022 C used as the controlling factor. Continuous physiological monitoring was performed using an MRI-compatible system (SA Instruments, Stony Brook, NY, USA). End-tidal CO 2 was measured with a capnograph (V9400, SurgiVet). Vital signs were within normal physiological ranges (rectal temperature: 36.5-37.5 \u2022 C, heart rate: 350-420 beats/min, breathing: 54-56 breaths/min, oxygen saturation: \u223c95%, end-tidal CO 2 : \u223c40 mmHg) throughout the duration of the experiment (Chan et al., 2009; Lau et al., 2011; Cheung et al., 2012a,b; Zhou et al., 2014) .\nAfter the mouse was placed in the scanner, scout images were acquired along the axial, coronal, and sagittal views to position MRI slices accurately. Scout T2-weighted (T2W) images were first acquired to position the subsequent images in a reproducible manner. The scan geometry was positioned according to the mouse brain atlas (Franklin and Paxinos, 2008) such that the third slice was centered on the inferior colliculus due to its size and visibility (Bregma \u22128.5 mm).

The mouse brain was manually masked based on the diffusion-weighted image ( Figure 1A) . Distortions in the DTI images were spatially corrected by non-linear registration to the T2 structural image of the same mouse. In brief, b0 and the T2 image were co-registered by a rigid transformation, followed by a two-dimensional affine transformation and a non-linear registration to improve the mapping between DTI and the structural image. The parameters of the three transformations were merged into a single transformation (Li et al., 2010) . The DTI index maps were calculated by fitting the diffusion tensor model to the diffusion data at each voxel using DTIStudio v3.02 (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA) as previously detailed (Chan et al., 2009; Hui et al., 2010; Ho et al., 2015; Abdoli et al., 2016) . The normalized maps were smoothed with a 0.3 mm Gaussian kernel. The 3xTg-AD and control data were entered into a single design matrix in SPM. A voxel-wise t-test was performed on each index map between control and 3xTg-AD mice. The first and last slices were excluded to avoid truncation artifacts. The VBS clusters were considered significant at threshold p < 0.05 and cluster size >3 voxels.

The EPI scan geometry was imported from the anatomical scan geometry. Two EPI sessions were performed. For each rsfMRI session, all images were first corrected for slice timing differences and then realigned to the first image of the series using SPM12 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, University College, London). A voxel-wise linear detrending with leastsquares estimation was performed temporally to eliminate the baseline drift caused by physiological noise and system instability. Spatial smoothing was performed with a 0.5 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. Temporal band-pass filtering was applied with cutoff frequencies at 0.005 Hz and 0.1 Hz. The first 15 image volumes and last 15 image volumes of each session were discarded to eliminate possible non-equilibrium effects. Finally, high-resolution anatomical images from individual animals were coregistered to a brain template with a 3D rigid-body transformation and the transforming matrix was then applied to the respective rsfMRI data (Chan et al., 2009 (Chan et al., , 2017 . To determine FC differences between 3xTg-AD and controls, seed-based analysis (SBA) was performed. Two 3 \u00d7 3 voxel regions were chosen as the ipsilateral and contralateral seed, respectively, in the hippocampus (Hip) and the caudate putamen (CPu; Figures 1C,E) . The CPu was used as a FC control for SBA analysis as it was similar in size to the overall hippocampus and little FC alteration in the 3xTg-AD model was suspected in comparison to the known hippocampal alterations (Oddo et al., 2003; Oishi et al., 2011; Shah et al., 2016 Shah et al., , 2018 . Regionally averaged time course from the voxels within each seed served as the respective reference time course. Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated between the reference time course and the time course of every other voxel to generate two rsfMRI connectivity maps for each region. A 3 \u00d7 3-voxel region on the contralateral side of the seed was defined as the ROI (Figure 1E) .

Lastly, interhemispheric FC was significantly reduced in the hippocampus of the 3xTg-AD compared with controls.

It is noteworthy, that in the PS1 gene familial AD M146V transgenic mouse model, authors reported an average reduction in hippocampal volume of 30% compared with controls (Gama Sosa et al., 2010) . In this study the hippocampal augmentation was accompanied by lateral ventricular enlargement (Gama Sosa et al., 2010) . In humans, lateral ventricular enlargement was found to be a prominent feature in AD (Cash et al., 2015) and even at early stages like MCI (Nestor et al., 2008) . Together this result indicates that ventricle enlargement could represent a prodromal feature related to AD that could be used as an early predictor of disease progression (Carlson et al., 2008; Weiner, 2008) ."}, {"section_title": "Prodromal DTI Changes in the 3xTg-AD Mouse Model", "text": "The main findings in this article show that subtle changes in structural and functional measures as assessed by MRI could be related to the prodromal progression of pathology in the 3xTg-AD. First, we describe subtle, but significant changes in the cortical structure of the 3xTg-AD characterized by an increase in FA and a decrease in RD \u03bb\u22a5 (Figures 2, 3) . This result provides new evidence at an early stage of the disease. Results in the literature using the same model indicate that at later time points (at least 11 months) FA was decreased in the 3xTg-AD (Snow et al., 2017) or no significant difference in 3xTg-AD mice compared with control mice was detectable (Kastyak-Ibrahim et al., 2013) . The rise before the fall in FA (i.e., increase before the decrease) we found in the present article, could represent an early compensation process (Alba-Ferrara and de Erausquin, 2013) . The finding correlates with evidence that during AD development there exists a reorganization of neuronal network connectivity, not only resembling a generalized reduction, but an adaptive response due to pathological changes (Dubovik et al., 2013) . Recent evidence in patients indicates that this increase in FA could be related to soluble A\u03b2 rising in the early stage of AD (Racine et al., 2014) . Furthermore, a meta-analysis of DTI studies indicated FA was decreased in AD in all regions except the parietal WM and internal capsule (Sexton et al., 2011) . As an example, in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD a significant FA and AD \u03bb// increase was found in the cingulate cortex and striatum; in addition to FA increases in the thalamus, MD and RD \u03bb\u22a5 increases in the bilateral neocortex, and FA increases in the left hippocampus (Shu et al., 2013) .

Some preclinical AD data has indicated altered rsfMRI FC (Sheline and Raichle, 2013) resulting in a loss of connectivity in the default mode network and salience network (Brier et al., 2012) and this finding correlates with A\u03b2 plaque accumulation, resulting in decreased connectivity between the precuneus and hippocampus (Sheline et al., 2010) . The reduction in interhemispheric connectivity, particularly in the hippocampal formation at a prodromal stage of the disease in the 3xTg-AD model (2.0 months) could be related to a previous report of alterations in working and reference memory (Stevens and Brown, 2015) . Working and reference memory rely on efficient hippocampal connectivity between cortical areas (Jones and Wilson, 2005) . Here, we note the FA and RD \u03bb\u22a5, increases and decreases, respectively, in the cortex of 3xTg-AD mice in the present study.

In this regard obtaining prodromal none invasive in vivo biomarkers for clinical translation is of high importance for AD research.
