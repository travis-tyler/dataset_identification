[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Small aggregates (oligomers) of the toxic proteins amyloid-\u2424 (A\u2424) and phospho-tau (p-tau) are essential contributors to Alzheimer's disease (AD).

These apparent \"disease-modifying\" actions of TEMT both prevent and reverse memory impairment in AD transgenic mice. Objective: To evaluate the safety and initial clinical efficacy of TEMT against AD, a comprehensive open-label clinical trial was performed. Methods: Eight mild/moderate AD patients were treated with TEMT in-home by their caregivers for 2 months utilizing a unique head device. TEMT was given for two 1-hour periods each day, with subjects primarily evaluated at baseline, end-of-treatment, and 2 weeks following treatment completion. Results: No deleterious behavioral effects, discomfort, or physiologic changes resulted from 2 months of TEMT, as well as no evidence of tumor or microhemorrhage induction. TEMT induced clinically important and statistically significant improvements in ADAS-cog, as well as in the Rey AVLT. TEMT also produced increases in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of soluble A\u2424 1-40 and A\u2424 1-42 , cognition-related changes in CSF oligomeric A\u2424, a decreased CSF p-tau/A\u2424 1-42 ratio, and -Commercial License (CC BY-NC 4.0).\n58\nreduced levels of oligomeric A\u2424 in plasma.

This failure so far may not be due to starting drug therapy too late in the disease process (as many believe), but rather because: 1) current drugs being clinically tested (especially proteins) have difficulty in crossing the blood-brain barrier and entering the brain's neurons [1] , and 2) the majority of AD drugs in clinical trials target either the large aggregates of amyloid-\u2424 (A\u2424) protein outside of neurons (neuritic plaques) or intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) made up of large insoluble phospho-tau (p-tau) protein deposits [2, 3] . However, both monomeric A\u2424 and p-tau are produced inside neurons, where they aggregate into soluble toxic \"oligomers\"-oligomers that most recent studies suggest are the primary culprits in AD (not the insoluble A\u2424 plaques or NFTs) [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . These \"intraneuronal\" A\u2424 and tau oligomers initiate and promote AD development by causing neuronal dysfunction and death through: 1) mitochondrial dysfunction/ATP suppression [11] [12] [13] , 2) microtubule destruction [14] [15] [16] , 3) dendritic spine regression [8, 17] , and 4) synaptic dysfunction [7, 18, 19] . Thus, any effective AD therapeutics or combination of therapeutics directed at A\u2424 or tau will probably need to penetrate the brain's neurons and be capable of disaggregating both A\u2424 and tau oligomers inside neurons.\nIn view of the inability of drugs to slow or reverse the cognitive impairment of AD thus far, investigating non-pharmaceutic interventions against AD as a possible alternative is now clearly warranted. Neuromodulatory approaches have consequently emerged and are currently being clinically tested in AD subjects. These approaches include transcranial magnetic stimulation (tMS), transcranial direct current stimulation, and deep brain stimulation. All three approaches provide a generalized stimulatory/ inhibitory effect on neuronal activity. The most recent and largest clinical studies involving long-term tMS (Phase III clinical trial) or deep brain stimulation (Phase II clinical trial) in AD subjects have reported minimal or no cognitive benefits [20] [21] [22] . As the newest neuromodulatory approach against AD, Transcranial Electromagnetic Treatment (TEMT) is very different from tMS because TEMT involves perpendicular magnetic and electric waves emanating away from an antenna/emitter source (rather than tMS's magnetic waves radiating from and returning to a conductor). For our studies, these \"electromagnetic waves\" are actually within the radiofrequency range (around 1 GHz), which can easily penetrate the human cranium and underlying brain areas.\nIn a number of pre-clinical studies involving AD transgenic mice [11, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] , we have administered TEMT daily (1 h in early morning and 1 h in late afternoon) for up to 8 months, at a frequency of 918 MHz, power (SAR) level of approximately 1 W/kg, and pulse repetition rate of 217 Hz. Utilizing these parameters and protocol, we have demonstrated the ability of TEMT to prevent/reverse both oligomeric and insoluble A\u2424 aggregation-both inside and outside neurons [11, 23] . These TEMT-induced reductions in brain A\u2424 aggregation are accompanied by brain mitochondrial enhancement [11] and prevention or reversal of cognitive impairment in AD transgenic mice at multiple ages [23, 24, 27] . Our most recent studies involving brain homogenates from human AD subjects provide evidence that TEMT not only disaggregates A\u2424 oligomers, but also disaggregates tau and \u2423-synuclein oligomers [Cao et al., unpublished data]. Oligomeric tau, although downstream from A\u2424 in AD pathogenesis, may be the main propagator of AD [9, 28] , and increasing evidence suggests \u2423-synuclein aggregation plays a role in AD as well [29, 30] . The general disaggregating ability of TEMT against toxic oligomers may be critical because any effective AD therapeutics will probably need to be capable of disaggregating both A\u2424 and tau oligomers within neurons; targeting only A\u2424 oligomers/aggregation may not be enough, especially after the disease has become established [9] . Thus, TEMT would appear to provide a cocktail of disease-modifying mechanisms by directly targeting brain aggregation of three toxic proteins, as well as the mitochondrial dysfunction of AD [11, 23, 24, 27, Cao et al., unpublished data] .\nAny \"disease-modifying\" therapeutic against AD must also be safe to administer over a long period of time. It is therefore important to note that we found no deleterious behavioral effects of daily TEMT administration for as long as 8 months in AD mice, as well as no changes in brain markers of oxidative damage or antioxidant enzymes/compounds [23, 26] . Moreover, measurement of brain temperature at intervals during long-term TEMT revealed no significant increases in brain temperature during \"ON\" periods [24] ; thus, cognitive benefits of TEMT occur without brain heating (e.g., through 'non-thermal\" mechanisms). This is important because essentially all reported deleterious effects of electromagnetic treatment on biologic functions/processes in animals or cell cultures involved induction of tissue hyperthermia [31] [32] [33] and/or involved only acute treatment. Indeed, many human studies involving short-or long-term exposure to electromagnetic fields similar to those in our pre-clinical studies (and in this open-label clinical study) have found no deleterious effects on general health, cognitive function, or a variety of physiologic measures [26] . Just as importantly, numerous recent large epidemiologic studies involving hundreds of thousands of individuals have shown that electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure (at frequencies and power levels similar to those in this study) does not increase the risk of any type of cancer [see 25, 26 for discussion and references].\nIn view of our extensive pre-clinical platform and the aforementioned wide spectrum of human safety studies, clinical trials of TEMT technology in AD were clearly warranted. Therefore, we designed and built a first-of-its-kind head device (the MemorEM TM ) for administration of TEMT to human subjects in their homes and by their caregivers. The present study reports on safety and efficacy endpoints in an open-label clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol NCT0295830) utilizing MemorEM TM head devices to provide daily TEMT to AD subjects over a 2-month period, as well as evaluation at two weeks following completion of treatment. The same TEMT parameters (frequency, power level) and protocol (twice daily 1-h treatments) were utilized in this clinical trial as used in our pre-clinical studies that demonstrated cognitive protection and reversal of impairment in AD mice. For efficacy endpoints, a battery of cognitive tasks (including the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale, ADAS-cog) was administered, blood/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was analyzed for AD markers (e.g., soluble A\u2424, oligomeric A\u2424, tau), and both FDG-PET and functional MRI (diffusion tensor imaging, DTI) brain imaging were performed. Given the relatively small number of subjects in this study (all of whom received TEMT), the significant treatment-induced effects being reported should be interpreted proportionally until results from a larger pivotal trial are available."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "A total of eight (8) subjects with mild-moderate AD were enrolled in this clinical trial over a rolling enrollment period of late 2017 through mid-2018 at the University of South Florida Health/Byrd Alzheimer's Institute (Tampa, FL), with all subjects completing the 2-month treatment study by the end of 2018 at the Byrd Institute. Subjects had to be diagnosed with mild or moderate AD, according to the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria. They had to be at least 63 years of age and exhibit a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 16-26 at screening. All subjects had a minimum of an 8th grade education and a head circumference between 53-60 cm (to minimize variability in head RF antenna/emitter locations). If they were being medicated with a cholinesterase inhibitor and/or memantine, subjects needed to be on such medication for at least 3 months prior to screening, on a stable dose for at least 60 days prior to screening, and maintained on that dose throughout the period of this study. Table 1 shows demographics and characteristics for each of the eight subjects participating in this study. In addition to their AD diagnosis from cognitive assessment at screening/baseline, the diagnosis of AD was further established by three indices included in this table. First, anatomic MRI analysis at screening indicated the presence of frontal/parietal lobe atrophy, hippocampal/temporal lobe atrophy, and/or global cortical atrophy. Second, quantitative Table 1  Subject Demographics/Characteristics   Subject  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  M e a n   Age  63  66  82  65  74  63  77  76  70.8  Gender (M,F)  F  M  M  F  F  F  F  F  \u2212  APOE genotype  3/3  3/3  2/3  2/3  3/3  3/3  2/3  3 data from baseline FDG-PET scans were evaluated for glucose hypometabolism. Although there is no established cut-off that would definitely differentiate AD subjects from normal controls, an \"AD signature meta-ROI\" has been developed that evaluates the averaged cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl) in three brain areas (angular gyrus, posterior cingulate, and inferior temporal cortex) [34] . The mean AD signature meta-ROI for young adults (aged [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] has been reported to be 1.87 and for aged control (>70 years) to be 1.56 [34] . An abnormal AD ratio has been defined as \u22641.32, which corresponds to 90% sensitivity for AD dementia [35, 36] . Averaging \"baseline\" quantitative CMRgl measures from the same three brain regions from each of the eight subjects of this study provided a similar AD signature meta-ROI index of brain hypometabolism for each subject. The results of this analysis (Table 1) indicate a mean of 1.20 for all subjects collectively, with only one subject having a ratio (1.40) a little above the abnormal AD ratio of 1.32 (Table 1) . Third, because of its use in identifying and confirming clinically-diagnosed AD, the CSF A\u2424 1-42 /total tau (t-tau) ratio at baseline was calculated for each subject and entered into Table 1 . The mean ratio of 0.90 is close to the mean ratio of 1.30 reported for diagnosed AD subjects by Niemantsverdriet et al. [37] , and far from the mean ratio of 3.96 for aged controls in that same study. Further supporting the diagnosis of AD for this study's subjects, another study determined a cut-off of 1.14 in the CSF A\u2424 1-42 /t-tau ratio between mild cognitive impairment and AD subjects, with AD subjects typically being below this value [38] . Therefore, the cognitive assessment, anatomic MRI analysis, hypometabolism analysis, and CSF A\u2424 1-42 /t-tau ratios from the subjects of this study are all consistent with the diagnosis of AD. It should be mentioned that this study involved indices of AD diagnosis (i.e., PET AD signature analysis of energy utilization, anatomic MRI analysis of brain atrophy, spinal taps for CSF marker analysis) that are often not performed together to firmly establish AD diagnosis. Exclusion criteria for this study included having more than 5 microhemorrhages evident in anatomic MRI at screening, a score of 4 or higher on the Hachinski Test, and a score of 2 or less on the Global Deterioration Scale (the latter as rated by the caregiver). Additional exclusion criteria included participation in a pharmaceutic clinical trial within 6 months of study enrollment and a history of immunotherapy research participation, uncontrolled major depression, a history of any clinically-defined neurological/psychiatric disorder (other than AD), including but not limited to: stroke, brain lesions, cerebrovascular condition, other neurodegenerative disease, significant head trauma, multiple sclerosis, or personal history of previous neurosurgery or brain radiation. All patients agreed to be in this study and gave written informed consent. For each subject, a caregiver (spouse, family member, etc.) needed to be identified who agreed to be responsible for the participation of the patient in the study (e.g., keeping a diary of health measures they collect on the patient at home, logging the patient's condition daily, and assuming responsibility for administering daily in-home treatment). Caregivers were required to have nonimpaired mental abilities and normal motor skills, as determined by the clinical investigators at screening."}, {"section_title": "Investigational device", "text": "The MemorEM TM head device is self-contained and has been designed for in-home daily treatment, allowing for complete mobility and comfort in performing daily activities during treatment (Fig. 1A) . The device has a custom-engineered circuit board and a rechargeable battery inside the box housing, as well as a control panel on the outside of the housing for treatment control. This control panel/battery box is worn on the upper arm and wired via a cable to eight specialized antennas/emitters embedded between a double-layered head cap worn by the subject (Fig. 1B) . The device is designed to allow no more than two 1-h treatments within a given 24-h period and requires at least a 7-h interval between those two daily treatments. When running a treatment, the device transmits electromagnetic waves in a pulsed fashion and sequentially through the 8 emitters at 915 MHz carrier frequency every 4.6 ms (e.g., a pulse repetition rate to each antenna of 217 Hz). Power levels (specific absorption rate, SAR) for each emitter were set at an average of 1.6 W/kg. At this frequency and power level, FDTD human head computer simulations (IEEE Model 1528 phantom) show that the eight emitters collectively provide both global and penetrating TEMT to the human forebrain, including the cerebral cortex and underlying structures ( Fig. 2A) . A very similar calculated SAR distribution is arrived at from actual electric field measurements taken under individual emitters and within brain gel \"in situ\" (inside a human head phantom), utilizing a robotic probe system and grid measurement pattern (Fig. 2B ).

As well, subjects did not complain of headaches, brain sensations, or any other side effects of TEMT during or following treatment. Caregiver recordings of blood pressure and temperature before, during, and 30-min following every treatment also did not show consistent changes in these physiologic parameters associated with TEMT administration.

Seven of the 8 subjects improved their performance, with a single subject displaying the typical decrease in ADAS-cog performance reported in numerous clinical trials for untreated (control) AD subjects over a similar time period [43] . The combined ADAS-cog performance of all 8 subjects (Fig. 3B ) revealed a clinically important improvement following 2 months of TEMT (ES = 0.71; p = 0.09) that was generally maintained at 14 days following completion of TEMT (ES = 0.57; p = 0.15).

For the \"5-trial recall\" measure of Rey AVLT, the individual scores of all 8 subjects are shown in Fig. 4C and their combined performance depicted in Fig. 4D .

As well, there was no change in the p-tau to t-tau ratio in CSF following 2 months of daily TEMT administration ( Fig. 7C ). However, there was a modest, but clinically important, reduction in both the CSF p-tau to A\u2424 1-42 ratio (ES = 0.61; p = 0.161) ( Fig. 7D ) and the CSF t-tau to A\u2424 1-42 ratio (ES = 0.52; p = 0.202) following TEMT.

For soluble A\u2424 , approximately 50-fold higher levels were present in CSF versus plasma. Similarly, a 6-fold higher level of soluble A\u2424 was evident in CSF versus plasma. By contrast, oligomeric A\u2424 levels were twice as high in plasma compared to CSF. For p-tau, levels were always higher in CSF because p-tau levels were essentially zero in plasma.

However, we are not aware of any published FDG-PET study involving AD subjects with only a 2-month interval between scans (as in the present study), much less a change in CMRgl within that interval. With stability in CMRgl thus assumed to be the case in AD subjects over any given 2-month period, we anticipated a priori that only a decrease or increase in CMRgl (not simply stabilization) observed over the 2-month TEMT period would indicate a treatment effect. As such, FDG-PET scans were quantitatively evaluated in 109 forebrain areas for BL versus Day 60 (end of treatment) differences in CMRgl for each subject.\nAnalysis of BL versus Day 60 (end of treatment) CMRgl involving all 109 brain areas collectively and for all subjects combined indicated essentially no treatment-induced change in CMRgl (average percent change of -0.74 \u00b1 0.95% for Day 60 versus BL). Similarly, there was no treatment-induced change in CMRgl when only the 40 bilateral cortical regions (frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital) were included (average percent change of -1.16 \u00b1 1.19% for Day 60 versus BL). Both of these percent changes are well below the 6% threshold set for a significant change in CMRgl at p < 0.05. For 7 of the 8 subjects, post-treatment FDG-PET brain scans revealed stable or enhanced (>6%) glucose utilization in at least 102 of the 109 brain regions.\nVisual comparison of pre-versus post-treatment FDG-PET horizontal sections for individual subjects revealed that most subjects exhibited no clear preversus post-treatment visual differences in CMRgl. This is consistent with the aforementioned quantifi-cation of forebrain/cortical areas and underscores stabilization of CMRgl over the 2-month TEMT period for most subjects in this trial. However, several subjects did exhibit a visual enhancement in CMRgl throughout the forebrain following 2 months of TEMT. Horizontal sections from one such subject are shown in Fig. 9 . This subject also exhibited a \"quantitative\" increase of \u22656% in CMRgl within 45 of the 109 brain areas evaluated.\nAlthough pre-versus post-treatment quantitative assessment of CMGgl did not indicate any treatment effects when CMGgl values from all subjects were combined, a significant correlation was present for individual subjects between their percent change in CMGgl for the 40 cortical regions collectively and performance in Rey AVLT 5-Trial Recall at 14 Days following completion of treatment (r = 0.802; p < 0.01); more positive percent changes in CMGgl following treatment were correlated with greater cognitive performance."}, {"section_title": "Areas of increased neuronal connectivity (DTI/FA) are present in the cingulate/cingulum following 2 months of TEMT in individual AD subjects", "text": "Tract-based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) provided a skeleton containing all major tracts common to all eight subjects (Fig. 10 ).

FA stability was evident during the treatment period, with only a small group of voxels in the posterior cingulate/cingulate and corpus callosum (arrows) exhibiting significant FA enhancement (red voxels) or FA reduction (blue voxels) for all eight subjects collectively (p < 0.05). sis for group differences between BL and Day60 (end of treatment) FA values indicated FA stability during the treatment period. Only a small group of voxels in the posterior cingulate/cingulate and corpus callosum exhibited significant FA enhancement or reduction (p < 0.05-corrected) collectively for the entire group of eight subjects (Fig. 10 ). This FA stability was also evident in sagittal, frontal, and horizontal planes of group results for voxel-by-voxel differences between BL and Day60; not a single voxel for all eight subjects collectively showed a significant enhancement or reduction in FA at p < 0.05 (data not shown). Further supportive of this overall stability in FA across all eight subjects was an ROI-based comparison of BL versus Day60 mean FA values in 12 a priori-selected brain ROIs (Table 3 ). Only one of the 12 brain ROIs showed a significant change in FA intensity for all subjects collectively at the end of the 2-month TEMT administration period.\nIn contrast to the above FA analysis involving combined pre-versus post-treatment FA comparisons from all eight subjects, clear differences in FA were revealed when subjects were evaluated individually. Because of its important role for integrating cognitive processes and involvement in AD [46] , the cingulate cortex/cingulum was pre-selected for doing this voxel-by-voxel comparison of baseline versus Day60 FA for each of the eight subjects. As anticipated from numerous studies reporting progressive reductions in FA throughout the brains of AD subjects even across only 3 months [47] , areas of decreased FA (pre-versus post-treatment) were seen in both anterior and posterior cingulate cortex/cingulum (Fig. 11 ). However, all subjects also had unexpected regions of \"enhanced\" FA within the cingulate cortex/cingulum at the end of TEMT administration (Fig. 11 ). Most subjects exhibited prominent areas of enhanced FA in both the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex/cingulum (Fig. 11A, B) , while a few subjects showed more pronounced FA enhancement in either the anterior (Fig. 11C ) or posterior region."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In view of the inability thus far of drugs to stabilize or reverse the memory impairment of AD, investigating non-pharmacologic interventions against the disease are now clearly warranted. Using a novel neuromodulatory approach against AD, Transcranial Electromagnetic Treatment (TEMT), we have consistently shown in our pre-clinical studies the ability of TEMT to prevent and reverse cognitive impairment in AD transgenic mice [23, 24, 27] . Based on our extensive pre-clinical data, the primary mechanisms for these cognitive benefits appear to be disaggregation of toxic A\u2424 and tau oligomers, along with associated mitochondrial enhancement [9, 23, Cao et al., unpublished data] . Utilizing a first-of-its-kind head device (the MemorEM TM ), the present clinical study provides evidence for both the safety and efficacy of daily \"in-home\" TEMT administration to mild/moderate AD subjects by their caregivers. Results indicate no deleterious side effects during the 2-month treatment period and reversal of cognitive impairment in key tasks (e.g., ADAS-cog, Rey AVLT). In addition, changes in CSF levels of soluble/oligomeric A\u2424 following 2 months of TEMT are consistent with a TEMT-induced disaggregation of A\u2424 in the brain and brain imaging results suggest that TEMT may have the capacity to enhance brain/neuronal functionality. Although these results need to be confirmed and extended in a controlled 'pivotal\" trial, they suggest that TEMT may be a safe, non-invasive therapeutic to stabilize or reverse the memory impairment of AD."}, {"section_title": "Safety analysis", "text": "This is the first study to administer TEMT to the entire human brain over an extended period of time. As such, a primary goal of this openlabel clinical trial was to determine the safety of daily, long-term, and global TEMT-specifically in AD subjects. No recurrent adverse/side effects were reported over the 2-month treatment period involving a total of 120 1-h treatments administered twice daily. Daily diaries kept by the subjects' caregivers indicated no consistent changes in blood pressure or body temperature associated with TEMT, as well as no recurrent changes in daily activities or anxiety level/mood. Moreover, no adverse effects were ascertained at every clinical visit and no visible induction of tumors/microhemorrhages was evident when comparing pre-versus post-treatment anatomic MRI scans. Therefore, TEMT appears to be a safe therapeutic intervention for chronic treatment of AD, at least for the parameters and treatment regime utilized in this study. This is consistent with a large body of epidemiologic literature indicating that humans exposed to similar EMF frequencies/power levels via mobile phones exhibit no deleterious behavioral/physiologic effects and no induction of brain cancer, even after many years of EMF exposure ( [26] for review).

Compared to baseline, averaged performance in the ADAS-cog was improved by over 4 points following 2 months of TEMT for 7 of the 8 subjects. Since a typical decline in ADAS-cog expected for AD subjects is around 4 points over a 12-to 15-month period [48] , 2 months of TEMT appears to have reversed cognitive decline (as measured by the ADAS-cog) of responding AD subjects as a group, perhaps back to the cognitive level subjects had 12 to 15 months earlier. Cognitive improvement after treatment was particularly apparent for the \"immediate recall\" component of ADAS-cog. Similarly, performance in the analogous \"5-trial recall\" measure of the Rey AVLT was greatly improved following TEMT administration. Results from both of these measures indicate the ability of TEMT to reverse short-term/working memory impairment.\nOf the two other components comprising the Rey AVLT, \"Percent Forgetting\" (or Retroactive Inter-ference) was improved following TEMT, but not Proactive Interference. These improvements in Rey AVLT 5-trial recall and Retroactive Interference (but not Proactive Interference) were predicted from our prior AD transgenic mouse studies, wherein the same results were seen in the same three measures of an analogous cognitive interference task utilizing essentially the same TEMT parameters and testing regime [23] . A third task wherein improvement was seen following TEMT was in repeating digits. MMSE scores remained stable during/following treatment, which is not surprising in view of this task being used primarily as an AD diagnostic screen and not for assessment of AD progression. By contrast, since the ADAS-cog and Rey AVLT are benchmark tasks that are often used as indices of AD progression and/or therapeutic efficacy, the TEMT-induced improvements (not just stabilization) shown by AD subjects in these tasks are particularly noteworthy. For example, there is a strong relationship between impairment in both Rey AVLT 5-trial Recall and Percent Forgetting with extent of brain atrophy in AD [49] . Moreover, impairment in both of these Rey AVLT measures (which was reversed by TEMT) has been shown to be a reliable index for AD diagnosis [50] [51] [52] .\nIt is important to indicate that cognitive testing was not done immediately after morning treatments at home, but rather starting around 2 hours thereafter and in the clinic. This extended beneficial period for hours following TEMT is consistent with our multiple studies in AD transgenic mice (utilizing essentially the same TEMT treatment regime) in which we demonstrated cognitive protection and impairment reversal with testing done 2-8 hours after morning treatment [23, 24, 27] . Underscoring an even more protracted cognitive benefit of TEMT in the present study, cognitive performance of AD subjects at 14 days following completion of TEMT often resulted in a similarly enhanced level of performance as immediately following TEMT completion. Thus, a general maintenance of cognitive improvement for weeks, even without continued daily treatment, may be resulting from the TEMT regime presently utilized.\nThe cognitive enhancements seen with TEMT administration are not likely due to repeated testing for a number of reasons. First, weekly ADAS-cog testing of control AD subjects for up to 5 weeks in each of 17 AD treatment studies usually showed a progressive decline or stabilization in ADAS-cog performance over those weeks (i.e., no improvement) [42] . Secondly, performance in Rey AVLT gets worse with progression of AD [49] . The Rey AVLT task, which targets episodic memory-an area particularly vulnerable to AD-related deficits-is likely to be especially resistant to practice effects, yet showed clear treatment benefits for the AD subjects of this study Third, repeated testing effects should have manifest themselves at the first repeat [53] [54] [55] , but that was not the case for ADAS-cog repeated testing in this study. And fourthly, the tasks most likely to show a repeated testing-induced improvement (clock draw, Trails A and B) did not do so. Instead, stability in cognitive performance (versus baseline) was observed in those tasks, and in all other cognitive measures that did not exhibit cognitive improvement. Thus, either stability or cognitive improvement was observed for all cognitive tasks administered in this study. It should be noted that cognitive testing involving the Uniform Data Set (UDS), which was incorporated into all Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers in 2005, showed that while both cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment subjects exhibited significant practice effects on repeated cognitive testing, no significant practice effects were present for AD subjects [56] .\nParenthetically, none of the eight subjects in the present study wanted to return their head device to the USF Health/Byrd Alzheimer's Institute following completion of treatment because they felt TEMT was providing benefit to them. Based on the encouraging cognitive benefits observed in this clinical trial and the subjects' collective enthusiasm to continue treatment, an extension study (ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol NCT03927040) is now in progress providing these same AD subjects with TEMT over an extended number of months. It is noteworthy that two academic groups in Italy have published uncontrolled clinical studies reporting that electromagnetic treatment quite different from the present study, nonetheless provided significant cognitive improvement to AD subjects in multiple standard tests [57, 58] . From a similar (preclinical) perspective, the cognitive benefits of TEMT that we initially reported in AD transgenic mice have since been confirmed by three international laboratories utilizing similar or different EMF parameters [59] [60] [61] ."}, {"section_title": "CSF/blood analysis", "text": "In CSF, A\u2424 1-42 , t-tau, and p-tau have shown to be consistently altered in AD versus controls, while A\u2424 1-40 levels appear much less affected if at all by AD. In this regard, the current diagnostic criteria for AD includes a CSF profile of low A\u2424 1-42 in combination with high t-tau and/or high p-tau levels compared to controls, a pattern commonly referred to as the \"AD signature\" [62] [63] [64] [65] . CSF levels of A\u2424 appear to be the earliest CSF marker to reflect AD-related pathology taking place in the brain [66] , while t-tau has been suggested to be the best single biomarker for AD diagnosis based on meta-analysis studies [65] . Indeed, recent studies have concluded that CSF biomarkers can identify early AD with the same high accuracy as amyloid PET scans [67] . As another potential AD biomarker, high CSF levels of oligomeric A\u2424 have also been associated with AD [68] [69] [70] , although some studies report significant overlap with controls [71] . These higher levels of CSF oligomeric A\u2424 in AD, in concert with the lower CSF levels of soluble (monomeric) A\u2424 , have been suggested to be due to increased oligomerization of monomeric A\u2424 in AD [72] .\nIn the present study, 2 months of TEMT resulted in increased CSF levels of soluble (almost entirely monomeric) A\u2424 1-40 and A\u2424 , while CSF levels of oligomeric A\u2424 were unchanged overall compared to baseline. However, those subjects with increased oligomeric A\u2424 in CSF following TEMT administration had an average 5+ point improvement in their ADAS-cog scores. This TEMT-induced overall increase in soluble (monomeric) A\u2424 and selective increase in oligomeric A\u2424 in CSF (for the best cognitive responders) is consistent with a TEMT-induced dissociation of both oligomeric (soluble) and insoluble A\u2424 aggregates in the brain. Such dissociation would include not only dissociation of oligomeric A\u2424 inside neurons, but also dissociation of insoluble A\u2424 deposits in neuritic plaques into soluble oligomers/monomers with the resultant increase in brain A\u2424 monomers/oligomers making its way to the CSF. Supportive of this premise, we have shown that long-term daily TEMT administration to AD transgenic mice results in increased soluble (monomeric) A\u2424 in their brains [11, 23] .\nCSF levels of t-tau, p-tau, and the p-tau/t-tau ratio were not affected by 2 months of TEMT administration in the present study. This could indicate a greater stability of soluble p-tau aggregates in the brain (compared to A\u2424 aggregates), resulting in limited disaggregation by TEMT in the present study, and thus minimal/no change in the flux of soluble brain tau into the CSF. Along this line, our work involving TEMT administration to human AD brain homogenates suggests that higher EMF power may be necessary to impact p-tau aggregates [Cao et al., unpublished data]. Nonetheless, modest reductions in p-tau/ A\u2424 1-42 and t-tau/A\u2424 ratios occurred in the CSF following 2 months of TEMT. If confirmed in future studies, these reductions could be important in view of studies showing that both ratios are increased in early AD [67] , that a higher CSF tau/A\u2424 1-42 ratio in aged controls results in increased risk of later AD [73] , and that such ratios may be more effective than standalone markers in predicting brain A\u2424 deposition detected by PET imaging in AD subjects [67, 74] . Thus, the presently-reported reduction in CSF tau/A\u2424 1-42 ratios following TEMT administration may signify, to some extent, an effect on the AD pathologic process.\nConcentrations of tau, p-tau, A\u2424 , and A\u2424 1-40 in plasma are 10-and 100-fold lower than in CSF [64] . Subjects in the present study exhibited these large concentration differences between CSF and plasma for p-tau, A\u2424 1-42 , and A\u2424 1-40 , but not for t-tau. Such concentration differences have called into question the accuracy of conventional ELISAs that are routinely used, in part due to the 1000x greater concentration of proteins in plasma versus CSF that can interfere with ELISA-based assays and cause decreased assay sensitivity [64, 75, 76] . Not surprisingly then, plasma A\u2424 and tau levels have been inconsistent for demonstrating AD-related changes versus controls [77] [78] [79] [80] . In the present study, plasma A\u2424 1-40 levels were modestly reduced following 2 months of TEMT, with the percent reduction in individual subjects correlated with their improvement in ADAS-cog. This suggests that plasma A\u2424 1-40 may provide at least a general index of cognitive benefit provided by TEMT. Importantly, plasma A\u2424 oligomer levels were reduced by 33% after 2 months of TEMT, which is noteworthy in view of multiple studies that have reported increased plasma levels of A\u2424 oligomers in AD subjects [81] [82] [83] . Exactly how TEMT provided this lowering effect on plasma A\u2424 oligomers is unknown, but could be related to the 2fold higher level of A\u2424 oligomers in plasma versus CSF in the same AD subjects of this study.\nComparison of plasma t-tau levels in AD versus controls have been contradictory, with studies showing elevated levels in AD [64, 84] , no difference [85] , or reduced levels in AD [86] . Unlike CSF tau's high diagnostic accuracy for AD [87] , plasma tau alone would appear to be an inadequate AD biomarker. Nonetheless, the present study found that 2 months of TEMT resulted in a modest increase in plasma t-tau levels. Since soluble t-tau is almost totally monomeric tau, this increase may reflect a treatment-induced increase in monomeric t-tau within plasma.\nIt should be noted that CSF levels of p-tau for AD subjects in the present study were determined with the p-Tau231 detection kit. This kit reports considerably lower p-tau levels in AD subjects compared to the p-Tau181 detection kit. In that context, CSF p-tau levels for AD subjects in the present study (around 32 pg/ml at baseline) are very consistent with levels in AD subjects reported in other studies utilizing p-Tau231 detection [88] and well above the CSF ptau levels for aged controls using p-Tau231 detection [89] . Similarly, the baseline average t-tau level in CSF for the present study's AD subjects was 310 \u00b1 60 pg/ml. This is very consistent with CSF t-tau levels for AD subjects reported in other studies wherein the same t-tau ELISA kit was utilized [65, 90] and well above the 100 pg/ml or less seen for aged controls in these same studies. Thus, CSF levels of both p-tau and t-tau for the subjects of this study were consistent with the diagnosis of AD. Because various detection kits are utilized for both p-tau and t-tau, it is important to recognize that there are no hard cut offs or thresholds for p-tau or t-tau levels in CSF that identify AD subjects.\nTo summarize the blood/CSF results, 2 months of TEMT to AD subjects appears to have affected multiple AD markers in CSF and plasma. Although the meaning of these effects is presently open to interpretation, impacting such AD markers by TEMT suggests an effect on the AD pathologic process and reduces any chance of placebo effects in this openlabel trial."}, {"section_title": "FDG-PET (glucose metabolism) analysis", "text": "This is the first study evaluating the effects of TEMT to the entire human forebrain on glucose (energy) metabolism therein. Brain glucose (energy) metabolism, or CMRgl, decreases years before the onset of AD cognitive impairment [91, 92] and continues to decline after AD diagnosis, as indicated by longitudinal FDG-PET scanning over intervals of 12 months or longer [44, 45] . However, we are aware of no studies that evaluated FDG-PET in established AD subjects over the relatively short 2-month interval of this study. Nonetheless, three prior studies suggested that we might observe enhanced CMRgl with TEMT administration to the AD subjects of the present study: 1) Daily electromagnetic field treatment to AD transgenic mice for 8 months increased brain FDG-PET signaling [61] , 2) A single 50-min mobile phone exposure in normal humans (at EMF parameters similar to those in the present study) increased FDG-PET signaling in brain regions closest to the mobile phone's ear location [93] , and 3) Enhanced mitochondrial function was seen in cerebral cortex and hippocampus in aged AD Tg mice given 1 month of daily TEMT at the same treatment parameters as in the present study [11] .\nIn the current study, however, stabilization (not enhancement) of CMRgl was observed in most subjects-not only for 109 forebrain areas evaluated collectively, but also for the 40 cortical areas evaluated collectively. Nonetheless, several AD subjects did have \"visually\" increased CMRgl throughout the forebrain following 2 months of TEMT, with one of these subjects also showing quantitative CMRgl increases (\u22656%) in almost half of the 109 forebrain areas evaluated. The stabilization of CMGgl observed in most AD subjects could indicate either: 1) stabilization that would have been present in any event over the 2-month period, or 2) a treatment-induced stabilization that may have continued with a more protracted treatment period. In either case, the strong correlation between cortical CMRgl and Rey AVLT performance at 14 Days post-treatment is supportive that greater positive effects of TEMT on brain glucose utilization (CMGgl) were associated with better cognitive performance weeks thereafter."}, {"section_title": "DTI/FA analysis", "text": "In functional MRI, Fractional Anisotropy (FA) is a widely used measure of Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) that is sensitive to changes in white matter integrity and neuronal connectivity [94] . Multiple studies have shown that brain FA consistently decreases as AD progresses [46, 95, 96] , indicating a progressive decline in neuronal integrity/connectivity. Along this line, longitudinal studies have shown a progressive decline in brain FA with DTI scans taken every 12 months for 3 years [96] and FA decreases within posterior cingulum and corpus callosum have also been reported over a 12-month interval [85] . Even over a relatively short 3-month interval between DTI scans, decreases in FA within cingulate cortex/cingulum, fornix, and splenium have been reported for AD versus control subjects [47] .\nIn the present study, DTI/FA was analyzed for TEMT effects in Tract-based Spatial Statistics (TBSS), wherein a skeleton was created that contains all major tracts common to all eight subjects. A voxel-by-voxel analysis within these major tracts indicated stabilization (no change) in FA for all eight subjects collectively across the 2-month treatment period. Similarly for all subjects combined, there was stabilization of FA across the treatment period for 12 pre-selected brain areas that were quantitatively analyzed. These results suggest either a TEMTinduced stabilization of FA or too short an interval (2 months) between DTI/FA scans to see spontaneous or treatment-induced changes in FA for all subjects collectively. However, when focusing on the cingulate cortex/cingulum and comparing each individual's pre-versus post-treatment scans in a voxel-by-voxel comparison, regional enhancements in FA were seen in all subjects. Such FA enhancements following 2 months of TEMT, which have not been reported to occur spontaneously during AD progression, were observed in both the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex/cingulum. This is noteworthy because: 1) both the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex/cingulum are important for memory integration, working memory, and/or executive function [46] , and 2) DTI/FA imaging of the cingulate cortex/cingulum shows progressive decreases in AD over periods as short as 3 months [47] . FA enhancements seen in individual subjects following TEMT suggest greater neuronal integrity/connectivity induced by treatment within discrete and subject-specific areas of this critical brain region for cognitive integration. These visuallyevident enhancements in FA within sub-regions of cingulate/cingulum were apparently masked by evaluating the entire anterior or posterior cingulate/cingulum for all subjects collectively."}, {"section_title": "Mechanisms of TEMT action", "text": "The primary mechanism of TEMT action for providing cognitive benefits to AD subjects appears to be disaggregation of toxic \"intraneuronal\" A\u2424 and tau oligomers, which most recent studies show to initiate and promote AD development, not the insoluble A\u2424 in neuritic plaques or insoluble p-tau in NFTs) [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Our and others' pre-clinical studies have repeatedly demonstrated the ability of TEMT to prevent A\u2424 aggregation and to disaggregate existing soluble/insoluble A\u2424 deposits in the brains of AD transgenic mice [11, 23, 24, 60] using essentially the same TEMT treatment parameters/regime as in the current clinical study. In our most recent studies using human AD brain homogenates, we have evidence that TEMT not only directly disaggregates oligomeric A\u2424, but also can directly disaggregate both oligomeric tau and oligomeric \u2423-synuclein [Cao et al., unpublished data]. Mounting evidence indicates that such disaggregation occurs through a destabilization of H-bonds between oligomer monomers through dipole-dipole inter-actions, vibration, and/or resonance phenomena [31] [32] [33] 97] . In this regard, electromagnetic/radiofrequency waves in the range used in our studies have been shown to cause reduced dipole-dipole interactions (dielectric loss), which leads to a decrease in inter-molecular H-bonding [98] . Indeed, the toxic protein \u2424-sheet aggregates of A\u2424, tau, and \u2423-synuclein have a common backbone polarization that is stabilized via \"two-electron\" interactions of H-bond [99] , a backbone that appears to be selectively disrupted by radiofrequency waves.\nIn addition to toxic protein disaggregation, we have also shown in AD transgenic mice that TEMT induces mitochondrial enhancement (e.g., increased ATP levels, membrane potential, and respiratory rates) through not only removal of toxic intramitochondrial A\u2424, but also directly through Complex IV activation [11] . Moreover, we have shown that TEMT induces increases in neuronal activity within the entorhinal cortex of AD transgenic mice [27] . Unlike pharmacologic interventions against AD, TEMT can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and enter the brain's neurons to provide toxic protein disaggregation, mitochondrial enhancement, and increased neuronal activity. Indeed, the ability of TEMT to directly disaggregate both A\u2424 and tau protein oligomers, and to also enhance mitochondrial function, provides a combination (cocktail) of AD therapeutic actions that has thus far not been possible for drug-based therapeutics. As was the case for AIDS, a multi-targeted therapeutic approach (such as that provided by TEMT alone or in combination with other therapies) will likely provide the best chance to stabilize or reverse the cognitive impairment of AD."}, {"section_title": "Study limitations", "text": "The main limitation of the present study, as with most open-label studies, is that all subjects received treatment (single-arm) without inclusion of an untreated/placebo group. However, the improvements in multiple cognitive measures observed with TEMT would have been highly unlikely to occur spontaneously in AD subjects, even with repeated testing (as discussed above). Moreover, it is difficult to explain away the CSF/plasma changes and DTI/FA localized enhancements, which are consistent with TEMT's primary mechanisms of action to disaggregate toxic brain oligomers and enhance mitochondrial function.\nA second limitation is the relatively small number of AD subjects (eight) in this study. In this regard, a small number of subjects (less than 10) has been typical of initial studies involving neuromodulatory approaches against AD such as tMS [100] and deep brain stimulation [101] . It is important to underscore that the diversity of safety, cognitive, CSF/blood AD marker, and brain imaging endpoints evaluated in the present study has not yet occurred for other neuromodulatory approaches being evaluated against AD. This study's comprehensive design and the presence of both cognitive and non-cognitive benefits/effects strengthen the premise that TEMT had a real and meaningful impact in the study's AD subjects.\nA third limitation of this study is the relatively short (2-month) treatment period. Although 120 treatments were given over that period, the actual treatment period may have been too short for sizable decreases in glucose utilization (CGMgl) or DTI/FA to occur. As such, the stability in these brain imaging endpoints may be due to a short pre-versus post period rather than to TEMT-induced stabilization. Parenthetically, we were unable to find any longitudinal FDG-PET or DTI study involving AD subjects that had a 2-month interval between brain scans.\nA final limitation of this study is that the degree of TEMT penetration into the brain is probably not as great as needed to more profoundly affect the forebrain and the end-points evaluated (particularly FDG-PET and DTI). Although the current MemorEM TM head device's power levels does provide sub-cortical EMF penetration, a more powerful head device would likely provide more robust benefits on cognition, blood/CSF markers, and functional brain imaging in AD subjects."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In summary, TEMT administration to AD subjects appears to be safe, while providing cognitive enhancement, changes to CSF/blood markers, and evidence of stable/enhanced brain functionality. Although these promising results need to be replicated in controlled clinical trials, they suggest that TEMT may provide a vertical leap to an entirely new therapeutic intervention against AD, an intervention that is \"disease-modifying\", non-invasive without apparent side effects, and is easily administered in-home."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "NeuroEM Therapeutics, Inc. gratefully acknowledges the financial support of the Glass Charitable Foundation, Angel Investor Forum, and NINDS for this study and studies related to its scientific foundation.
