The number of persons in the US with arthritis is anticipated to rise from 40 million in 1995, 15% of the population, to 59 million, 18% of the population, by 2020 [1] . Current treatments for osteoarthritis may improve symptoms but do not delay progression. Progression of osteoarthritis to advanced and disabling stages is the leading indication for joint replacement.\nEpidemiologic studies have supplied, in addition to incidence, prevalence and risk factor data, much of what is known about the natural history of osteoarthritis. Factors linked to disease progression or to osteoarthritis-associated disability may represent targets for development of disease-modifying interventions. This paper notes past, especially longitudinal, studies and describes recent studies in greater detail."}, {"section_title": "Defining osteoarthritis", "text": "Over the course of the 20th century, the definition of osteoarthritis evolved considerably, from 'hypertrophic arthritis' to the most recent consensus definition [2]: 'OA diseases are a result of both mechanical and biologic events that destabilize the normal coupling of degradation and synthesis of articular cartilage chondrocytes and extracellular matrix, and subchondral bone. Although they may be initiated by multiple factors, including genetic, developmental, metabolic, and traumatic, OA diseases involve all of the tissues of the diarthrodial joint. Ultimately, OA diseases are manifested by morphologic, biochemical, molecular, and biomechanical changes of both cells and matrix which lead to a softening, fibrillation, ulceration, loss of articular cartilage, sclerosis and eburnation of subchondral bone, osteophytes, and subchondral cysts. When clinically evident, OA diseases are characterized by joint pain, tenderness, limitation of movement, crepitus, occasional effusion, and variable degrees of inflammation without systemic effects.'\nOsteoarthritis traditionally has been classified as primary (idiopathic) or secondary to joint trauma, congenital or developmental abnormalities, other bone and joint diseases, and other endocrine and systemic diseases. Idiopathic osteoarthritis may be local (confined to one joint) or generalized (commonly defined as affecting the hands and at least one major weight-bearing joint). Localized osteoarthritis most commonly occurs in the hands (proximal and distal interphalangeals), first carpal metacarpal, feet (especially first metatarsophalangeal), knee, hip, or spine (especially cervical and lumbosacral).\nMuch effort has been devoted to developing a standard definition of osteoarthritis for epidemiologic studies -a definition that encapsulates symptoms, disability, and joint structural disease. At the heart of the difficulty in establishing a single definition is that although there is some correlation between radiographic disease severity and both symptoms and disability, the relationships are not as strong as we would expect.\nOf note, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) diagnostic criteria for knee [3] , hip [4] , and hand [5] osteoarthritis are intended to distinguish osteoarthritis from other causes of symptoms and are best suited for recruiting patients from clinical settings in which a high prevalence of other arthritides or soft tissue conditions and a higher (than the general population) likelihood of having symptomatic osteoarthritis is expected. In epidemiologic studies, however, the ability to distinguish osteoarthritis from the absence of joint disease is paramount [6-8]. For this reason, and the possibility of infrequent or intermittent symptoms, epidemiologic studies have tended to rely on radiographic definitions of osteoarthritis. Symptomatic, radiographic osteoarthritis has been defined by a radiographic criterion coupled with the positive response to a question, e.g. pain, in that joint, on most days of a month within the preceding year. Some individuals have osteoarthritis changes without symptoms of consequence; the use of a definition combining symptom presence with radiographic criteria reflects a desire to identify persons with clinically significant osteoarthritis. A potential limitation of this approach is that a subset of individuals with osteoarthritis may have physically limiting or disabling disease but selfreported symptoms that fall below the applied 'symptomatic' cut-off.\nTo date, epidemiologic studies continue to use radiography, with heavy reliance on definite osteophyte presence to document knee osteoarthritis, and a combination of osteophytes and joint space narrowing to define hip osteoarthritis. Defining hand osteoarthritis is important for the investigation of the osteoarthritis itself and to document its presence as a marker of generalized arthritis. Most epidemiologic studies have relied on the presence of definite osteophytes. The most commonly used method to score radiographic severity is the Kellgren and Lawrence grading system [9] based on the presence of osteophytes, loss of joint space width, subchondral sclerosis, and bony attrition. Epidemiologic studies commonly use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in addition to radiography. MRI-based definitions of osteoarthritis have not as yet been established."}, {"section_title": "Incidence of osteoarthritis", "text": "In two studies, incidence rates for knee osteoarthritis were 240 [10] and 164 per 100 000 person-years [11] . Women, from perimenopausal ages and older, are more likely to develop osteoarthritis of the knee, hip, and hand than are men. In the Framingham cohort [12] , women (mean age at baseline 71 years) developed radiographic knee osteoarthritis at a rate of 2% per year and symptomatic radiographic knee osteoarthritis at 1% per year, whereas these rates in men were 1.4 and 0.7%, respectively.\nEstimates of hand osteoarthritis incidence range from just under 2% to 4% per year, depending on how osteoarthritis is defined and the characteristics, especially age, of the population studied [13] [14] [15] . In the Tecumseh study [13] , in persons 27-51 years of age, 1.8% developed hand osteoarthritis per year, whereas in the Framingham cohort [15] (mean age 55 years) 3.2% of men and 3.6% of women developed hand osteoarthritis. Oliveria and colleagues [10] reported the age-standardized and sex-standardized incidence rate for symptomatic, radiographic hip osteoarthritis to be 88 per 100 000 personyears (95% confidence interval [CI] 75-101). Wilson and colleagues [11] reported an incidence rate of 47.3 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 27.8-66.8)."}, {"section_title": "Prevalence of osteoarthritis", "text": "Studies providing data to estimate prevalence of knee [16] [17] [18] [19] , hip [16, 17, 20, 21] , and hand [16, 17, 22] osteoarthritis have been reviewed in several papers and textbook chapters. As recent studies describe, in the Beijing Osteoarthritis Study population [23, 24] , prevalence of hip osteoarthritis in men and women was lower and prevalence of knee osteoarthritis in women was higher than in US cohorts, applying the same case definitions and methods. For radiographic hip osteoarthritis, prevalence ratios were 0.07 (Chinese women to white women in the Study of Osteoporotic Factors [SOF]), 0.22 (Chinese women to women in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey-I [NHANES]), and 0.19 (Chinese men to white men in the NHANES-I) [23] . For radiographic knee osteoarthritis, prevalence ratios were 1.45 (Chinese women to Framingham women) and 0.90 (Chinese men to Framingham men) [24] . Some, but not all, of the greater prevalence of knee osteoarthritis in Chinese women may be due to prolonged squatting [25] ."}, {"section_title": "Risk factors: introduction", "text": "Individual studies have traditionally sought to identify risk factors for incident disease or osteoarthritis progression, but not both, owing in large part to the cost and logistics of powering both outcomes. The current era is witness to the development and initiation of two largescale studies that will have power to study incidence, progression, and disability within the same study: the MOST study (Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study) and the OAI (Osteoarthritis Initiative).\nA candidate risk factor's effect on each outcomeincidence and progression -should be specifically and separately examined. It is widely believed that the risk factor profiles for each of these key outcomes may overlap but are not identical. Also, the magnitude of the effect of a given risk factor may differ according to the stage of osteoarthritis disease present at the knee, i.e. prior to definite osteoarthritis (the stratum for study of incident osteoarthritis) or after osteoarthritis is definitely present (the stratum for progression). As in the MOST and OAI studies, it is best that the examination of effect on each of these outcomes occurs within the same study. Otherwise, if the effect on incidence differed from that on progression when these outcomes were examined in separate studies, it would remain possible that the difference was linked to methodologic differences between studies [26 ] .\nAn additional key design element of the MOST and OAI studies reflects evolution in our views of the basic osteoarthritis condition that is of highest priority to study in terms of potential intervention or prevention strategy development: the cohorts of each of these studies include individuals with symptomatic radiographic knee osteoarthritis or those at higher (than the general population) risk of developing it [26 ] ."}, {"section_title": "Risk factors for incident osteoarthritis", "text": "For many years, epidemiologic studies focused on identifying risk factors for incident osteoarthritis, yielding a rich literature."}, {"section_title": "Genetic factors", "text": "Early evidence to support a genetic contribution to hand osteoarthritis came from Stecher [27] , who found that Heberden's nodes were three times as common in the sisters of affected subjects as anticipated. Much investigation has focused on generalized osteoarthritis or hand osteoarthritis; the shift recently has been towards jointspecific subsets. It is likely that at a genetic level, premature generalized osteoarthritis is a heterogeneous condition. Col2A1 is not to be the gene at fault in premature generalized osteoarthritis without signs of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia [28] . Over the past several years, numerous studies have been performed including twin, sib-pair, and segregation studies. It is not possible in this space to summarize this large body of work; two very helpful reviews have been published recently [29 ,30] .\nAn area of recent focus has been heritability of cartilage volume and other articular and periarticular features. Results from a classic twin study [31] revealed heritability estimates of 61, 76, 66, and 73% for femoral, tibial, patellar and total cartilage volume, respectively. In a longitudinal study [32 ] of sibling offspring of patients who had undergone total knee replacement for osteoarthritis, heritability estimates (for change) were 73 and 40% for medial and lateral cartilage volume, 20 and 62% for medial and lateral tibial bone size, 98% for medial chondral defects, and 64% for muscle strength; adjusting for other change parameters and what was predominantly mild radiographic osteoarthritis had little impact."}, {"section_title": "Congenital and developmental deformities of the joint", "text": "Local factors that affect the shape of the joint may increase local stress on cartilage and contribute to the development of osteoarthritis, especially in the hip joint. Blatant examples of such abnormalities include congenital hip dislocation, Legg-Perthes disease, and slipped capital femoral epiphysis. More subtle and asymptomatic anatomic variations have also been associated with hip osteoarthritis, however. Lane and colleagues [33] , examining baseline and 8-year follow-up radiographs, found that an abnormal center-edge angle and acetabular dysplasia were each associated with increased risk of incident hip osteoarthritis, adjusting for age, current weight, body mass index (BMI), affected side, and investigational site (adjusted odds ratio 3.3; 95% CI 1.1-10.1 for center-edge angle and 2.8; 95% CI 1.0-7.9 for acetabular dysplasia)."}, {"section_title": "Aging", "text": "Although osteoarthritis is not an inevitable consequence of aging, aging is the strongest identified risk factor for the development of osteoarthritis. The process that leads to osteoarthritis may begin earlier in life, before symptoms develop. Aged cartilage has altered chondrocyte function and material properties and responds differently to cytokines and growth factors. In addition, joint-protective neural and mechanical factors may become impaired with age, such as proprioception, varus-valgus laxity, meniscal integrity, and muscle strength and mass. For reasons not elucidated, this age-associated increase is greater in women.\nIn a longitudinal study of the Chingford population [34] (women, mean age 54.1 years), belonging to the highest of three age groups was associated with an increased risk of knee osteoarthritis (odds ratio 2.41; 95% CI 1.11-5.24), adjusting for hysterectomy, estrogen replacement therapy, smoking, physical activity, pain, social class, height, and weight. The magnitude of risk associated with aging may lessen as older ages are reached. Age did not affect the risk of knee osteoarthritis in a longitudinal Framingham study [35] in which the mean subject age at baseline was 70.5 years. In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSOA) study, Kallman et al. [36] found that age increased the risk of osteoarthritis for almost every radiographic feature in every hand joint group."}, {"section_title": "Epidemiology of osteoarthritis Sharma 149", "text": "Injury to the joint Osteoarthritis may result after an injury, either as a primary effect (i.e. direct damage to articular cartilage) or secondarily, due to the greater stress to cartilage resulting from damage to load-attenuating knee tissues. Apparent in several cross-sectional studies, the link between knee injury and osteoarthritis has been more difficult to demonstrate in longitudinal studies [34, 35] , perhaps due to the possibility that injured individuals developed osteoarthritis before the baseline evaluation of a given study and would therefore not be included for analyses of osteoarthritis incidence [35] . In a study by Gelber and colleagues [37] , over a median follow-up of 36 years, the cumulative incidence of knee osteoarthritis by age 65 was 13.9% in persons who had had a knee injury during adolescence or young adulthood and 6.0% in those who had not (relative risk 2.95; 95% CI 1. 35-6.45 ). Knee and hip injury at cohort entry or during follow-up increased the risk for subsequent osteoarthritis at that site (relative risk 5.17 and 95% CI 3.07-8.71; and 3.50 and 95% CI 0.84-14.69, respectively)."}, {"section_title": "Occupational physical activity", "text": "The health of cartilage and other joint tissues requires regular joint loading. If loading is extreme in frequency or intensity, however, it can exceed the tolerance of a joint and contribute to osteoarthritis development. After a systematic review of studies examining the link between occupational activity and osteoarthritis, Maetzel et al. [38] concluded that there is evidence of a strong positive relationship between work-related knee bending and knee osteoarthritis. The role of occupational activity is better understood in men than in women, in part because almost all previous studies assessed paid labor, did not include homemaking or child-rearing activities, and occurred when most women did not work outside the home.\nAs summarized by Maetzel et al. [38] , a consistent though weak relationship has been reported between workrelated exposure (especially farming) and hip osteoarthritis in men. Certain occupations predispose towards hand osteoarthritis. Lawrence [39] found that British cotton mill workers had more hand osteoarthritis than did age-matched controls. Hadler et al. [40] found that among textile workers, burlers and spinners (tasks involving precision grip) had significantly more distal interphalangeal osteoarthritis than did winders (a task involving a power grip). Winders did not have more osteoarthritis in the carpal metacarpal joint by radiographic score but did have decreased carpal metacarpal range of motion as compared with burlers and spinners."}, {"section_title": "Nonoccupational physical activity", "text": "Although elite athletes (competing at the national or international level) have a greater risk of osteoarthritis at various sites that is not fully explained by overt injury, epidemiologic studies have fairly consistently suggested that neither recreational running nor greater composite physical activity increases the risk of osteoarthritis. In a longitudinal study of runners compared with controls matched for age, sex, education and occupation, Lane et al. [41] found that, of 73 individuals, nine developed knee osteoarthritis over a 5-year period by ACR criteria: five were controls and four were runners. Panush et al. [42] also found no difference in rate of osteoarthritis development between 17 male runners (53% marathon runners) and age-matched and weight-matched controls.\nIn the Framingham study [43] , habitual physical activity (a weighted and summed measure of hours per day at various activities), assessed at two previous examinations, did not predict the presence of knee osteoarthritis. In longitudinal studies of the Chingford population [44] , physical activity was not linked to incident osteoarthritis in the uninvolved knee in those with unilateral knee osteoarthritis, nor was it linked to incident osteoarthritis in the full cohort [34] .\nTwo caveats should be noted. First, it is believed, although not based on formal investigation, that an anatomic abnormality in a joint or periarticular structures may increase the physical activity-associated risk of osteoarthritis [45] . Secondly, one longitudinal study [46] introduces the possibility that the combination of very heavy physical activity and age may be linked to an increased risk of knee osteoarthritis. In elderly persons (mean age 70 years), the odds of developing radiographic knee osteoarthritis were increased by self-reported heavy physical activity (e.g. odds ratio 7.2; 95% CI 2.5-20) for more than 4 hours per day of heavy activity. No relationship was detected with moderate or light physical activity, number of blocks walked, or number of flights of stairs climbed daily."}, {"section_title": "Obesity", "text": "In the Framingham cohort [47] , weight (in persons of median age 37 years) predicted the presence of knee osteoarthritis 36 years later. The age-adjusted relative risk for knee osteoarthritis in the heaviest quintile of baseline weight compared with the three lightest quintiles was 2.07 (95% CI 1.67-2.55) for women and 1.51 (95% CI 1.14-1.98) for men. A decrease in BMI of 2 units over the previous 10 years decreased the odds of knee osteoarthritis (odds ratio 0.46; 95% CI 0.24-0.86) [48] . In a longitudinal study of the Chingford population [34] (women, mean age 54 years), belonging to the top BMI tertile was associated with an increased risk of knee osteoarthritis (odds ratio 2.38; 95% CI 1.29-4.39) adjusting for hysterectomy, estrogen replacement therapy, physical activity, knee pain, and social class. In Chingford subjects with unilateral knee osteoarthritis [44] , 46% in the top BMI tertile developed osteoarthritis in the uninvolved knee over 2 years compared with 10% in the lowest tertile. In contrast to the knee, a more modest association between body weight and hip osteoarthritis has been found [49, 50] ."}, {"section_title": "Bone mineral density", "text": "The relationship between bone mineral density (BMD) and knee osteoarthritis has been examined in several studies, based on the clinical observation that osteoarthritis and osteoporosis rarely coexist. In a study of the Rotterdam population [51] , at baseline, those with knee or hip osteoarthritis had 3-8% higher femoral neck BMD compared with those without osteoarthritis -a difference that was significant in women only. Repeat BMD measurements 2 years later revealed that the rate of bone loss was higher in those with osteoarthritis. In theory, a decline in BMD might be cytokine mediated or a consequence of reduced physical activity [51] . In the longitudinal Tecumseh Study [52] , women who developed osteoarthritis were more likely to have had higher baseline bone mass (metacarpal bone cortical area) than women who did not develop osteoarthritis; these women also had a greater likelihood of bone loss over time.\nCross-sectional studies of the Framingham [53] and Chingford [54] cohorts found that participants with knee osteoarthritis had a 5-10% higher BMD than those without knee osteoarthritis. Several studies support that those with hip osteoarthritis have a higher bone mass at both axial and appendicular sites (reviewed in [55] ). In crosssectional analyses in the SOF [56] , women with Kellgren/ Lawrence grade 3-4 hip osteoarthritis had higher ageadjusted BMD at the femoral neck and Wards triangle, trochanter, lumbar spine, distal radius, and calcaneus compared with those with Kellgren/Lawrence grade 0-1 in the worse hip.\nAs reported by Zhang et al. [77] over 8 years of follow-up of the Framingham cohort, risk of incident osteoarthritis was lowest in the lowest BMD quartile (5.6%) and was higher in the higher three BMD quartiles (14.2, 10.3, and 11.8%). This (i.e. incident osteoarthritis) was mainly reflected in an increased risk of osteophyte development. Among those with osteoarthritis, however, with greater BMD at baseline, risk of progressive osteoarthritis decreased from 34.4% in the lowest BMD quartile to 19% in the highest quartile, mainly due to an effect on lowering risk of joint space loss. In theory, this might relate to the fact that earlier stages of osteoarthritis are typically characterized by increased subchondral thick-ness and bony sclerosis, whereas progressive osteoarthritis is often accompanied by bony attrition [77] .\nHurwitz et al. [78] and Wada et al. [79] demonstrated a relationship between the adduction moment and medial to lateral ratio of proximal tibial BMD. As noted by Hurwitz et al., although it is a long-held belief that the adduction moment is the chief determinant of medial/ lateral tibiofemoral load distribution, these studies represent the first evidence of its relationship to underlying bone. Recently Lo et al. [80] found that medial bone marrow lesions were associated with a higher medial to lateral BMD ratio and lateral bone lesions with a lower ratio."}, {"section_title": "Estrogen deficiency", "text": "Estrogen may have direct effects on articular cartilage or may influence osteoarthritis development via effects on bone or other joint tissues. Based on observational studies, estrogen replacement therapy after the menopause may protect against the development of knee osteoarthritis. In many of these studies, the relationship does not achieve statistical significance. Results are consistent in the direction and magnitude, however, and suggest a gradient of protection (i.e. greater protection conferred with current compared with past estrogen replacement therapy) [57] . In a longitudinal Framingham study [58] , the odds ratio for past use compared with never used was 0.8 (95% CI 0.5-1.4) and for current use compared with never used 0.4 (95% CI 0.1-3.0), adjusting for age, BMI, femoral neck BMD, physical activity, weight change, knee injury, smoking, and baseline Kellgren/Lawrence grade. Similarly, a protective effect (not achieving significance) for incident knee osteophytes was seen with current estrogen replacement therapy in a longitudinal Chingford study [44] . In a cross-sectional study of white women 65 years and older in the SOF [59] , current estrogen users had a reduced risk of hip osteoarthritis (odds ratio 0.62; 95% CI 0.49-0.86) and of moderate-severe hip osteoarthritis. Current users for 10 or more years had a greater reduction in risk of hip osteoarthritis compared with those who had used for fewer than 10 years.\nAn MRI-based, cross-sectional study [60] suggested that women using estrogen replacement therapy may have greater articular cartilage volume than nonusers. Total tibial cartilage volume was 7.7% (0.23 ml) greater in the group of estrogen users than in the nonusers.

A randomized clinical trial of vitamin D, including assessment of potential disease-modifying effect, is underway at Tufts University.\nA threefold reduction in risk of osteoarthritis progression was found for both the middle and highest tertiles of vitamin C intake, primarily related to a reduced risk of joint space loss. Those with high vitamin C intake also had a reduced risk of developing knee pain (adjusted odds ratio 0.3; 95% CI 0.1-0.8).

Varus-valgus alignment also influenced the likelihood of patellofemoral osteoarthritis progression in a compartmentspecific manner at 18-month follow-up [65] . Varus alignment increased the odds of patellofemoral osteoarthritis progression isolated to the medial patellofemoral compartment (adjusted odds ratio 1.85; 95% CI 1.00-3.44).

In keeping with this, the relationship between BMI and disease severity in the MAK study [67] had a significantly steeper slope in varus than in valgus knees. Also, the BMI/medial osteoarthritis severity relationship was substantially attenuated after adjusting for varus severity. That alignment modifies the BMI effect is also supported by a recent longitudinal study [68] , in which some effect of BMI on progression was found in knees with moderate malalignment (odds ratio 1.23/2-unit increase in BMI; 95% CI 1.05-1.45) but not in knees with neutral alignment.

In varus-aligned knees examined separately, a thrust was associated with a threefold increase in the likelihood of progression, suggesting that a thrust further increases the risk of progression over and above the risk conferred by static varus alignment. In theory, the impact of a varus thrust on progression of knee osteoarthritis may be mediated through the associated dynamic instability of the knee or an acute increase in load across the medial tibiofemoral compartment, the most common site of osteoarthritis disease at the knee.

The magnitude of hip muscle torque generated during ambulation can be measured in quantitative gait analysis. Weakness of hip abductor muscles in the stance limb may cause excessive pelvic drop in the contralateral swing limb, thereby shifting the body's center of mass toward the swing limb and increasing forces across the medial tibiofemoral compartment of the stance limb. Hip muscle strength is the major source of hip abduction moment magnitude, with the hip joint ligaments and capsule also making a small contribution to the moment.

The two studies [75, 76] examining the relationship of quadriceps strength and subsequent tibiofemoral osteoarthritis progression found no evidence of a protective effect, however. In a study [76] in which the strength/progression relationship was examined within knee subsets, in malaligned knees and in lax knees, greater strength at baseline was associated with a greater risk of osteoarthritis.

Most studies of knee osteoarthritis have emphasized physical function limitation, assessed by selfreport or specific task performance, and have less often examined disability, i.e. performance within a typical physical, social, and cultural context.\nSeveral factors have been identified as potential determinants of physical functional status in knee osteoarthritis including obesity, comorbid diseases, depressive symptoms, low social support, and low levels of physical activity. All but a few studies on physical function limitation in knee osteoarthritis have been cross-sectional, however.\nIn the Observational Arthritis Study in Seniors (OASIS) [81] , in older persons with knee pain, self-efficacy predicted both self-reported and stair-climb performance outcomes, after adjusting for pain and strength. Similarly, in the MAK study [82] , better baseline self-efficacy protected against a poor WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMasters University Osteoarthritis) Index function and chair-stand outcome assessed over 3 years (odds ratio for poor outcome 0.79/5 self-efficacy score points; 95% CI 0.67-0.93; and 0.78/5 points; 95% CI 0.62-0.97, respectively), without evidence of confounding by age, BMI, severity of pain, strength, or mental health status.\nIn this study, both baseline knee pain intensity and the baseline to 18-month change in pain predicted function outcome. A paucity of information concerning the longitudinal relationship between pain intensity and physical function in knee osteoarthritis exists. In OASIS [83] , baseline knee pain intensity during ambulation and transfer predicted a decline in performance during stair-climb and car tasks, respectively, but not in selfreported function. The relationship between knee pain intensity and function decline was not significant after accounting for self-efficacy and the self-efficacy-strength interaction. In the MAK study, the strength/function outcome relationship was lost after additional adjustment for self-efficacy [82] .\nTogether, these results suggest a close relationship between strength, knee pain intensity, and self-efficacy in their effect on physical function in knee osteoarthritis. Pain may acutely reduce the maximal voluntary contraction and lead to chronic activity revision or avoidance. A downward spiral of pain, weakness, and reduced selfefficacy may lead to substantial reduction in activity. In support of this paradigm, subjects with knee osteoarthritis and pain were weaker than those without pain [84] , and in OASIS, there was evidence of an interaction between strength and pain [81] as well as strength and self-efficacy [83] in evaluating the effects on physical function.\nOther factors linked to physical function in knee osteoarthritis from longitudinal analyses of the MAK study [82] were age, medial-lateral laxity, varus-valgus alignment, social support, and Short Form-36 mental health score. Age predicted the chair-stand performance outcome, in keeping with the finding that age was associated with an increased risk of losing mobility over the next 4 years in the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly [85] . A relationship between depressive symptoms and physical function has also been described in longitudinal studies not limited to individuals with arthritis, as summarized by Ormel et al. [86] , and in crosssectional studies of knee osteoarthritis [84, [87] [88] [89] ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Several factors that appear to influence osteoarthritis incidence, progression, and function decline have been identified. Many of these factors are modifiable, at least in theory. Recent waves of findings from observational studies, such as those described here, are promising. As additional studies are completed and more is learned about these and other factors, opportunities will very likely arise to initiate intervention and prevention strategy development. Such work, which may ultimately have an impact on the course of osteoarthritis, will require involvement from investigators in several fields including physical therapy, bioengineering and gait analysis, and physical medicine and rehabilitation."}, {"section_title": "References and recommended reading", "text": "Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as: of special interest of outstanding interest Additional references related to this topic can also be found in the Current World Literature section in this issue (pp. 204-208)."}]
