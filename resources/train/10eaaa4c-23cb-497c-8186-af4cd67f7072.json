[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Analyzing the pathways of people who earned interdisciplinary research doctorates in the United States in 2010, we generate three main findings while controlling for gender, ethnicity, discipline, and age. First, individuals who complete an interdisciplinary dissertation display near-term income risk since they tend to earn nearly $1,700 less in the year after graduation. Second, students whose fathers earned a college degree demonstrated a .8% higher probability of pursuing interdisciplinary research. Third, the probability that non-citizens pursue interdisciplinary dissertation work is 4.7% higher when compared with US citizens. Our findings quantify the risks of interdisciplinary work and contribute to policy debates."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "against the backdrop of claims that globally important problems require more interdisciplinary integration (e.g., Schmidt et al., 2012) , greater knowledge of any factors that currently contribute to boundary spanning should be helpful for encouraging more people to work across disciplinary lines. Finally, in light of interests of colleges and universities to employ diverse workforces (e.g., Oldfield, 2008) , it is valuable to know whether people are disproportionately likely to pursue interdisciplinary postgraduate research as a function of demographic variables such as gender, citizenship status, and parental backgrounds.\nWe approach the subject of academic boundary spanning through a riskbased framework that extends Montmarquette et al.'s (2002) findings that -based on their undergraduate degrees -fields such as the sciences with higher salaries tend to entail more career risk; and, conversely, fields such as education that yield lower salaries tend to entail less career risk. Our approach is comparable to studies concerning the calculation of risks made by boundary spanners in nonacademic contexts (e.g., Janowicz-Panjaitan & Noorderhaven, 2009); however, our focus on academicians allows us to consider a clear set of measurable outcomes. More specifically, we assume that interdisciplinary postgraduate research entails relatively greater risks -and potential rewards -when compared with traditional discipline-focused research. Comparable to the question of whether entrepreneurs are aware of the risks that they face (e.g., Cassar, 2010), the current research contributes to greater awareness of the potential costs of academic risk-taking for PhD seekers. Throughout our analyses, we presume that academia is not an exceptional industry whose dynamics are exempt from generalizable organizational dynamics."}, {"section_title": "Academic Boundary Spanners 5", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "The industry of academia is most commonly and directly regulated at the level of discipline-based departments through hiring and promotion. For example, Abbott (2001) argues that \"as long as disciplinary academics act as the primary hiring agents for universities, they perpetuate the disciplinary system\" (p.\n126) and that \"absent any radical change in the process of academic hiring, the current social structure of disciplines will endlessly recreate itself\" (p. 127). Less directly but still importantly, hiring and promotion decisions at the department level are commonly and, in many cases, strongly influenced by decisions made by discipline-based journals and granting agencies to publish manuscripts and fund research proposals. With respect to these goals, Rhoten and Pfirman (2007, p. 68) stress the fact that \"interdisciplinary papers are harder to review\" since they are typically judged by people from a variety of disciplines who often have conflicting measures of quality. Similarly, notwithstanding the laudable goals of select journals to embrace diverse perspectives and approaches (e.g., Hinings, 2010) and administrative initiatives to provide interdisciplinary programs with hiring and promotion decisions (e.g., Ehrenberg, 2004) , Oberg (2009, p. 408) elaborates that interdisciplinary research is often assessed by reviewers according to discipline-specific biases in favor of certain methods (e.g., large-scale quantitative analysis) over others (e.g., case studies). In other words, people who specialize intensively in a discipline gain knowledge that is \"largely tacit, situated, and experiential\" (Kellogg, Orlikowski, & Yates, 2006, p. 24 ) that implicitly presents challenges and risks for would-be spanners.\nThe relative risk for individuals to span disciplinary boundaries is reflected by Rhoten and Parker's (2004) findings that \"graduate students and full professors were indeed overrepresented\" in their study of interdisciplinary programs when contrasted with the proportions of non-tenure-track faculty, Academic Boundary Spanners 6 postdoctoral researchers, and faculty at the assistant and associate ranks.\nReasonable interpretations of this pattern recognize that graduate students have not yet committed as much time to any specific discipline and may be unaware of the potential labor market consequences. Full-rank professors, though, \"have accumulated greater professional freedom and more social resources\" (Rhoten & Parker, 2004 , p. 2046 and, consequently, are more able -at that point in their careers -to become boundary-crossers (cf. Inkson, Gunz, Ganesh, & Roper, 2012) . Interestingly, this pattern is comparable with Colignon's (1987) finding that boundary spanners in a large non-academic enterprise tended to occupy highly ranked positions. As for individuals who have made a significant investment of energy through completion of a doctoral program, the traditional discipline-based reward system would seem to explain why those most likely seeking promotion (e.g., to Associate or Full professor) tend to avoid interdisciplinary research.\nBeyond Rhoten and Parker's (2004) systematic study based upon career stage, there has been little attention focused on the demographic profile of people who pursue academic boundary spanning; instead, it is more common for researchers to conduct bibliometric studies of boundary spanning that are not focused on the spanners (e.g., Pieters and Baumgartner 2002). In one exception, Falkenheim (2011) tabulates which specific universities tend to graduate the highest number of people who report interdisciplinary research activity. In a more substantive and sweeping exception, Rhoten and Pfirman (2007) test the hypothesis that women might participate disproportionately in interdisciplinary research because of a position that some have advanced that women are more inclined to think holistically, across disciplinary boundaries. While they report mixed results for their \"women are more holistic\" hypothesis, they are also clear about their main interest to draw more attention to the question of \"who\" pursues interdisciplinary postgraduate research."}, {"section_title": "Academic Boundary Spanners 7", "text": "Consistent with our motivation to understand the antecedents and consequences of decisions to span academic boundaries, there are concerns regarding the risks associated with interdisciplinary research and degrees. For example, Rhoten and Pfirman's (2007) consideration of gender as a potentially relevant demographic variable is reflected in their conclusion that \"using interdisciplinarity to attract women, as well as other underrepresented minority groups into science, is only practical and ethical if it leads to stable and secure pathways through scientific and academic careers\" (p. 72). The relevance of this concern is illustrated clearly through the National Science Foundation's (NSF)\nIntegrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) programs (e.g., Borrego & Newswander, 2010; Moslemi et al. 2009; Schmidt et al., 2012) that are specifically geared to training graduate students to span academic boundaries. On the one hand, it makes sense for solution-driven projects to proceed without the burden of disciplinary hinges on the grounds that new problems require new \"disciplines.\" In fact, in a study of knowledge-intensive firms outside of academia, Leiponen and Helfat (2010) report that firms tend to enjoy comparative advantages as a function of the breadth of their knowledge sources. On the other hand, though, there has been remarkably little investigation to date with respect to the individual-level outcomes that tend to obtain for graduate students who do engage interdisciplinary studies.\nThe potential conflict of institution-and individual-level interests anticipated by Rhoten and Pfirman (2007) is best viewed as an extension of the more basic conflict of interest that people have debated with respect to recruiting individuals for any graduate program. For example, as Baird (1991) discovered, the number of graduate students in a department accounts significantly for the number of publications produced by a department's faculty (e.g., in collaboration with graduate student researchers) even though \"the publications rate of departments has little to do with educational outcomes for students\" (p. 316)."}, {"section_title": "Academic Boundary Spanners 8", "text": "Against that backdrop, departmental efforts to recruit students for interdisciplinary research may reflect the department's goal of broader recognition while not necessarily preparing graduate students for the associated risks.\nIndependent of one's views on the implications of Baird's findings, students agreeing to pursue interdisciplinary research may not fully consider, or even understand, the risks involved in such doctoral programs. Students may be \"na\u00efvely optimistic\" (Golde & Dore, 2001 ) about their postgraduate employment outcomes just as overly optimistic personalities may place disproportionate weight on positive outcomes (Weinstein, 1980 (Weinstein, , 1989 . Regardless of the reason, one of the motivations for our analyses is to generate knowledge concerning the typical pathways taken by individuals pursuing interdisciplinary postgraduate research. Individuals evaluating the benefits and risks associated with these programs will profit from a more systematic analysis of the antecedents and consequences for people enrolled in these programs.\nIn a risk-return framework, it makes sense that individuals postpone employment for graduate studies since there is a premium associated with the additional schooling (Autor, Katz, and Kearney 2008) . Yet, given the academic uncertainties related to interdisciplinary work, as well as the difficulty interdisciplinary PhD degree seekers encounter in completing their studies (Newswander and Borrego, 2009) , it is an open question to consider whether interdisciplinary work is rewarded. Specifically, previous research has not quantified the rewards or risks associated with interdisciplinary dissertation research.\nIn the analysis that follows, we will (1) examine the existence and strength of any near-term income risk associated with completing an interdisciplinary dissertation and (2) consider the distributional characteristics of people who complete an interdisciplinary dissertation. Our approach presumes that Academic Boundary Spanners 9 understanding how these doctoral recipients are distributed across demographic dimensions will supply university administrators and policy makers with information for developing relevant curricula and programs to produce successful PhD earners."}, {"section_title": "II.", "text": "DATA AND METHODS"}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The "}, {"section_title": "Variables", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Interdisciplinary Postgraduate Research", "text": "Following previous researchers (Falkenheim, 2011; Millar & Dillman, 2010a , 2010b , we categorized respondents to the SED who indicated a secondary field for their degree as people who pursued interdisciplinary postgraduate research.

As a result, the estimating equation transforms to a generalized linear model of the form\nwhere is the standard normal cumulative distribution function so we use the probit estimation procedure to estimate the vector of unknown parameters.\nTo understand how interdisciplinary degree seekers are distributed across demographic characteristics we assume a linear relationship between the propensity to pursue an interdisciplinary degree, and the independent variables, or factors.

The subscript INT on the x vector and random error term in equation (4) identifies the vector of explanatory variables and random error term in relation to the decision to pursue interdisciplinary research. As with equation (2), IntDisc i * is unobserved so a binary variable is used instead and a probit estimation procedure is used to estimate the vector of unknown parameters.\nFinally, because a significant proportion of PhD earners are not US citizens, we estimate an equation similar to (4) though we do not include the parental education variables (there are likely significant discrepancies in parental education levels across countries) and include a USCit variable indicating whether an individual is a US citizen.

RESULTS", "text": "As indicated in Table 1 , a significant percentage of individuals who earn doctoral degrees engage in boundary-spanning research. In fact, among those whose primary field is in the Agricultural and Life Sciences, 44% of respondents reported their work as interdisciplinary. Surprisingly, since the disciplines would seem to be closely related, the second lowest percentage of interdisciplinary dissertations (27%) was found among people in the Social Sciences. Across the sample used in this study, it is notable that 13,979 people (32.5 %) reported their work to span academic boundaries. Table 1 about here\nDescriptive measures of the sample of US citizens are given in Table 2 . In the sample, 30% of US citizens who earned research doctorates in 2010 chose to pursue interdisciplinary dissertation work, 51% were women, 83% were White or European American, more than half of their mothers and/or fathers had earned a college degree, and their average age was 36. Correlation coefficients for the variables of interest also indicate potential contributors to the decision to pursue interdisciplinary work and factors that may influence salary.\nAcademic Boundary Spanners 17 Table 2 about here\nNear-term income risk associated with interdisciplinary postgraduate research is indicated by the results in Table 3 . Individuals who completed risky boundary-spanning dissertation research tend to earn significantly less income in their first year of employment with a doctoral degree (Table 3 and Figure 1 ). At the margin, individuals who sought an interdisciplinary degree earn nearly $1700 (3%) (from $58,014 to $56,342; p<0.001) less than those who pursued a traditional degree. Holding research fields and other demographic characteristics constant, Table 3 shows that women tend to earn less compared to men upon completion of the doctorate. Interestingly, European American individuals also earn less in their first year after graduation than those in other racial groups.\nWhile there is abundant previous research focused upon the role of gender and ethnicity for salaries among professional employees (e.g., Kulich et al., 2011) , our findings for the marginal effects of pursuing interdisciplinary postgraduate research -when controlling for gender and ethnicity -provides novel insight. Table 3 about here - Table 4 about here\nThe patterns that we report in Tables 3 and 4 paint a consistent picture whereby people who conduct boundary-spanning doctoral research appear to face relatively worse outcomes in employment in the first year upon graduation.\nWhile we found evidence of other factors -gender and ethnicity -contributing to variation in the two outcome variables that we studied, the significant marginal Academic Boundary Spanners 19 effect for interdisciplinary background upon employment as a postdoctoral researcher is noteworthy.\nGiven the evidence for income risk apparent in the data, we also compared the variances for each outcome variable in case those who conducted interdisciplinary dissertations might demonstrate relatively divergent outcomes.\nIn other words, is the distribution of earnings a simple shift in means, or is there greater variance for those pursuing interdisciplinary work? In both cases of salary and postdoctoral status, there was no significant difference in the variances, indicating that pursuing a traditional research PhD or not accepting postdoctoral employment first order stochastically dominates the alternative choices.\nConsequently, while the potential riches of interdisciplinary research and writing appear obvious when one looks at academic celebrities, our focus on near-term consequences does not permit consideration of outcomes beyond the first year of earning the PhD.\nIn Tables 3 and 4 , we also point out an interesting relationship evident in variables representing the four Carnegie classifications. Individuals who attended a university with moderate research activity reported higher earnings immediately after graduation relative to those who attended universities with extremely high research activity. Results in Table 5 report predicted values for interactions between pursuit of interdisciplinary postgraduate research and the Carnegie classifications. These predicted values were generated from results reported in Tables 3 and 4 . Interestingly, a greater proportion of those who attend universities with very high research activity and pursued an interdisciplinary PhD accepted a postdoctoral position, which likely contributes to the lower salary they received."}, {"section_title": "---------------------------------", "text": "Insert Table 5 about here\nInsert Table 6 about here\nInsert Table 7 about here"}, {"section_title": "---------------------------------Academic Boundary Spanners 20", "text": "To understand how interdisciplinary degree seekers are distributed across socioeconomic and other dimensions, we estimated the parameters of equation (4).

While it is interesting that paternal -and not maternal -education is important, the findings suggest that people from families with more formal education may engage, with greater probability, the risk of interdisciplinary postgraduate research.

DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS", "text": "Given the income risk associated with pursuing an interdisciplinary PhD, there is need to understand why individuals accept this risk. While the data does not include measures that can help identify risk preferences or other psychological characteristics, previous research provides some insight on the topic."}, {"section_title": "Rewards of Risk Taking", "text": "The risk-based framework for our analyses of the pathways traveled by people who conduct interdisciplinary research appropriately considers antecedents and consequences given an expectation from standard economic modeling that greater risk should correlate with greater rewards -or, at least, greater variance in "}, {"section_title": "Privileged Risk Taking", "text": "With respect to understanding the motivation of interdisciplinary degree seekers, the conventional view is that risk-taking behavior is a relative luxury.\nInvestors, for example, commonly specify that any money invested in risky speculative stocks should be money that can be lost without great trouble (i.e., a category of money that most would consider to be a luxury). When applied to the questions that we are examining, the prediction is that people who belong to relatively privileged social groups will be more likely to pursue relatively risky interdisciplinary postgraduate research.\nFocusing on ways in which a student's socioeconomic background might influence their selection of undergraduate majors, it is notable that students whose parents did not earn a college degree tend to disproportionately pursue \"vocational\" degrees (e.g., in business, education, and engineering) while students with at least one parent who earned a college degree tend to pursue the relatively riskier \"arts and sciences\" (Goyette & Mullen 2006; Mullen et al. 2003; Wolniak et al., 2008) . The same variable -whether or not someone is a first-generation college student -also appears to account for differences with respect to other aspects of academic career paths (e.g., Kniffin, 2007) , including the pursuit of risky graduate degrees. Drawing on data from the 2002 Survey of Earned Doctorates conducted by the National Science Foundation (NSF), Hoffer et al.\nreport: \"Compared to doctorate recipients with higher levels of parental education, the first-generation graduates were over-represented in education \u2026 and underrepresented in humanities and, to a lesser extent, social sciences and physical sciences\" (2003, p. 36) . In a separate survey of more than 9,000 doctoral students from 21 research universities in the US, Nettles and Millett (2006) find a similar pattern whereby the percentage of graduate students with at least one parent with a doctoral or professional degree ranges from 16% in the least-risky field of education to 24%, 26%, 27%, and 34% for students, respectively, enrolled in engineering, social science, science, and humanities doctoral programs.\nWhile our results only weakly support privileged risk taking in terms of parental education, it is important to recognize that this variable is only a proxy for parental income and lifetime wealth. In this respect, the significant but weak findings from our study do not negate the evidence from other studies that white males raised by highly educated parents tend to pursue the riskiest degrees (cf. Ball, Eckel, & Heracleous, 2010) ."}, {"section_title": "Entrepreneurial Immigrants", "text": "Comparing US citizens with non-citizens across industries, immigrants to the US tend to disproportionately pursue entrepreneurial goals (FPI, 2012) . Fixed Academic Boundary Spanners 24 into the narrative of the US as a \"bastion of opportunity,\" the tradition of immigrants founding companies has a long history and cuts across industries (e.g., Ndofor & Priem, 2011) . While much of the popular focus on immigrants opening their own businesses has focused on retail establishments, there is ample evidence that immigrants also contribute significantly -and disproportionately -to innovations in a wide range of skilled professions. Hunt and Gauthier-Loiselle consider the full array of doctoral recipients rather than limiting our interests on those in the sciences and engineering (Grogger and Hanson, 2013) and we examine the degree to which immigrants pursuing the PhD exhibit the risk-taking entrepreneurial traits of immigrants in other industries. Evidence from our analysis supports the notion that in academia, immigrants to the US still exhibit an entrepreneurial spirit.\nLimitations of our results that point to directions for future research include our reliance on near-term outcome measures since it is possible that longitudinal studies would demonstrate less unfavorable outcomes for those who completed interdisciplinary dissertations. With respect to antecedents, our study does not take into account the possibility of pre-existing differences in the intelligence or aptitude of those who conduct interdisciplinary research. For example, while interdisciplinary postgraduate tracks such as the NSF IGERT programs are prestigious and competitive, it is plausible, at least, that students who choose interdisciplinary paths tend to face relatively worse near-term outcomes for reasons that are not due to their interdisciplinary pursuits. A comparison of standardized test scores (e.g., from the Graduate Record\nExamination [GRE] ) that contrasts the populations of those who do and do not complete interdisciplinary postgraduate research would be one way to address this question of omitted variables with respect to potential differences in aptitude.\nFinally, our focus on one year of data invites the question of whether cyclical patterns might exist with respect to the main findings that we report. For example, just as others have found that members of different ethnic groups variably decide to enter graduate school as a function of business cycles (e.g., Bogan and Wu, 2012; Johnson, 2013) , it is possible that overall economic climates influence the degree to which doctoral students pursue interdisciplinary research. Empirical investigations modeled on our study could investigate whether expansionary economic periods tend to be accompanied by higher-risk interdisciplinary dissertations.\nAcademic Boundary Spanners 26"}, {"section_title": "V. CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Our analyses provide significant new insights by estimating the near-term consequences for risky boundary-spanning within the industry of academia and understanding the variables that contribute to pursuit of interdisciplinary postgraduate research. First, we find evidence that boundary spanners face income risk, at least in the first year after graduation. With respect to antecedents, we find among US citizens that people with relatively privileged situations, as measured by paternal education levels or university prestige, appear more likely to be academic boundary-spanners. Additionally, as with other industries, immigrants appear significantly more likely to be academic risk takers. In both of these cases, it is also notable that gender is not predictive of decisions to pursue interdisciplinary postgraduate research. In this sense, our findings reject the \"women are more holistic\" hypothesis that Rhoten and Pfirman (2007) proposedthough we appreciate that it was their primary interest to draw closer systematic attention to the questions that the current research directly addresses.\nTo highlight one of our results that in turn highlights our juxtaposition of academia alongside other industries, our finding that academic boundary spanners are more likely to accept relatively short-term employment as postdoctoral researchers is arguably consistent with Dokko and Roskopf's (2010) recognition that boundary spanners outside of academia -perhaps due to their exposure to multiple firms, at least -have more opportunities to gain diverse employment experiences. While we generally accept that the differences between academia and other industries have been \"overdrawn\" (Sauermann & Stephan, 2013) , the current value system in academia clearly imposes a cost on boundary spanning even if -as Kellogg et al. write about general \"communities of practice\" -the academic discipline system \"reflects occupational conventions and understandings rather than rational calculations of efficiency\" (2006, p. 24) . It is Academic Boundary Spanners 27 outside of the scope of our analysis to speculate on the future of academic labor markets; however, it is logical to expect that if academia were to become more institutionally organized to tackle contemporary problems in the way that competitive firms are expected to behave rather than remain tied to historical disciplinary boundaries, then one would expect that boundary spanners would obtain better near-term outcomes. Likewise, one would expect that the demographic profile of boundary spanners to become less extraordinary if the relative risks were minimized.\nUncoincidentally, perhaps, the analyses that we present are interdisciplinary to the extent that we integrate research conducted by education policy researchers and treat the industry of academic research and the market of academic researchers as comparable to other industries and labor markets. Just as studies of the automobile industry might lend themselves to policy recommendations in relation to industry-wide regulations, our study of academia -particularly because of our analyses related to near-term consequences -should inform regulatory-type debates with respect to institution-level encouragement of academic risk-taking. Most remarkably, our findings indicate a mismatch between institution-level interests to foster academic risk taking and individuallevel experiences -in the near term, at least. This finding is particularly important since without recognizing the systematically probable outcomes for a given pathway, any policy recommendations (e.g., to encourage more interdisciplinary research) are problematic.\nIn the case of our analyses, evidence that a greater proportion of immigrants tend to pursue boundary spanning research also lends itself to endorsements of policies that open more doors for immigrants to doctoral programs in the US. On the other hand, though, evidence for near-term income risk should provide caution -or at least more information -for anyone considering institutional encouragement or individual pursuit of academic Academic Boundary Spanners 28 boundary spanning at the doctoral-student career stage. When viewed together as part of the risk-based conceptual framework that motivated our work, the implications from our study clearly benefit from the concurrent consideration of factors that contribute to the pursuit of boundary spanning as well as the outcomes that tend to occur.
