INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) [1] is a progressive disease with memory loss and other cognitive disabilities symptoms, which accounts for sixty to eighty percent of all dementia cases. AD was first described in 1906, and after 70 years it was recognized as a major cause of death [2] . In 2015, it was recorded that 110,561 deaths were attributed to AD by official death certificates, making AD the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. According to Wikipedia, AD is one of the most costly diseases. 1 In 2018, it was estimated that 47 billion dollars were projected to AD or other dementias. Early diagnosis may slow down the progression of the disease, and therefore, reduce the substantial cost for health care. The research showed that the early treatment which decreases the rate of functional decline Alzheimer or other dementias would reduce average per-person lifetime cost by 4,122 dollars in 2017 [1] .\nIn general, there are several stages in AD. Compared to Normal Controls (NC) who are healthy, AD is the patient The associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and approving it for publication was Wenbing Zhao. 1 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease who gets a degenerative disease of the brain. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is the prodromal stage of AD [3] . The symptom of patients may develop to the intermediate stage, namely progress Mild Cognitive Impairment (pMCI). It may also remain in a stable stage, that is stable Mild Cognitive Impairment (sMCI). In practice, the doctors care more about the time point when the disease is transformed from one symptom to another, while current researches mainly focus on predicting the possibility that the disease transforms into another stage. However, it is difficult to forecast the progress of the disease by simply classifying the states from sMCI to pMCI. Our model can predict the transform stage over a period of time. Different from previous work, a model to predict the development of AD with LSTM [4] - [6] is proposed.\nOn one side, according to the studies, brain changes associated with AD may begin more than 20 years before symptoms appear. On the other side, LSTM, with the chain of repeating neural network module, is capable of learning long-term dependencies. In this paper, considering that the time series data may affect the prediction, we use the time step data obtained by a data preprocessing pipeline. Base on these data, we build an LSTM time sequence model to predict the AD.\nThen, we compare the efficiency of our algorithm with recent state-of-art algorithms. Furthermore, we test our algorithm's stability in different data size and evaluate our algorithm's sensibility on different features."}, {"section_title": "II. RELATED WORK", "text": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) [7] , Positron Emission Tomography (PET) [8] and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) [9] are the Alzheimer's neuroimaging tools used for researches and some cases of clinical diagnosis aids. Recently, a number of studies use imaging data to facilitate the development of treatments that target underlying brain changes at each stage [10] . The AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 2 is a data resource providing the datasets for researchers, including MRI, DTI, and PET images. Among all these image data types, MRI is a technique used to image the anatomy of the brain. With MRI, atrophy can be measured by the volume of gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) of the brain.\nIn the literature, there are in general three different methods [11] , [12] to identify AD. Conventionally, the prediction is made with traditional classifier on human-engineered features [13] - [15] . In recent years, there appear classification approaches that are built based on the deep neural network [16] . The combination of deep neural network and traditional classification approach also can be seen in recent literature. In these hybrid approaches, the neural network is either treated as the feature selection tool or used as the classifier given human engineered features are ready [17] - [20] .\nIn the first category of methods, Gray Matter (GM) tissue volumes of the Region-Of-Interest (ROIs) are selected by using the Discriminative Self-representation Sparse Regression. The features are thereafter fed into SVM classifier to make the prediction [13] . In the second type of the approaches, Random Forest (RF) is adopted to undertake the selected features and the Deep Neural Network (DNN) is adopted to do the classification [20] . For the third category approaches, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) along with PCA-LASSO is designed to select features. Similar to the first type of approaches, the SVM is adopted to classify the disease [19] . In the first and second methods, traditional classification is unable to use time-relative features predicting the disease. However, for both of the first and second types of approaches, it is hard for traditional classifiers to make use of the temporal status of each individual case in the data.\nAlthough the classifier is powerful for the first and second types of approaches, the performance is still limited due to the lack of temporal information in the traditional features. Contrast to these categories of approaches, the third type of methods is able to capture the time-sensitive features, which could be conveniently used to predict the future stage of the disease. Due to the superiority of this type of approaches, it is adopted in our design. First, data are pre-processed by reclassifying, data interpolation, data normalization, and 2 http://adni.loni.usc.edu/ data serialization. Then, an LSTM model is built to perform the prediction. As shown in the experiments of Table 2 , our approach demonstrates better performance than the existing approaches on time sequence data."}, {"section_title": "III. DATA PREPROCESS", "text": "The images are extracted from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. In the datasets, one thousand series of cases showing AD progress symptom were collected. The datasets released from ADNI are adopted in our experiments. They have been pre-processed by skull strip, registration, segmentation, normalization, and smoothing [21] . The image process is conducted by following the procedures. All the skulls are stripped from images firstly, then images are registered with each other and performed the segmentation of the main brain structures. After that, all the images are normalized and smoothed into a standard size.\nFor advancing the prediction of dementia, five most quantitative biomarkers are recently included in the revised diagnostic criteria for AD and MCI due to AD [22] . These five biomarkers belong to three categories of MRI: measures of the volumes, cortical thicknesses, and surface areas. They are cortical Thickness Standard deviation (TS), cortical Thickness Average (TA), Volume of WM Parcellation (SV), Surface Area (SA) and the volume of Cortical Parcellation (CV). The ROI features, such as volume, cortical thickness and surface areas, are extracted by using the Freesurfer from MRI, PET, and DTI. The image preprocessing pipeline is shown in Figure. 1.\nThe data from ADNI are the original medical examination data, with missing records, which include the missing records of examination in time series and the missing records of image type. Missing records of examination, in other words, means that not all the subjects take the examination regularly. One example of missing image type is that the subject only has the examination data of MRI but without PET. All in all, the data have to be preprocessed before the model training. In order to identify the time series data of a subject, we have to preprocess the data by collecting the time series data under the same subject. In addition, because the prediction is different from the classification, the original classification is reorganized into the converted states. In other words, classification identifies the current state, while prediction identifies the future's state. For example, when we feed a series of the previous state into the model, it will output the next state.\nMRI Longitudinal time sequence data acquired from ADNI have 1105 subjects. Total records include 1272 NC, 1741 MCI, and 965 AD, in which, 32 NC converted to MCI, 147 MCI converted to AD, 1 NC converted to AD, 25 MCI converted to NC, 6 AD converted to MCI. In our experiments, we select data randomly from these data set with 900 NC, 900 MCI, and 900 AD records.\nWe pre-process the data by reclassifying, data interpolation, data normalization, data serialization, and time step preprocess. The data processing pipeline is shown in Figure. converted classes as independent classes. Usually, the last stage of converted classes is one of the following three stages: AD, NC, and MCI. In our experiment, following this convention, eight categories are reclassified into three categories according to the stages of the disease (AD, NC, and MCI). Besides, linear interpolation is adapted to fill the missing feature data. The pre-processed data are further re-scaled into the range of [0, 1], and the data are serialized after the object VOLUME 7, 2019 following the time step. Although some of the objects are collected more than ten years, most of the objects have one or two records (one record for every six months). Considering the data distribution, we reformat the data series in two time steps.\nIn Figure. 2, data interpolation shows one example of a subject, for whom all the data are in the table. Each row indicates the features, and each column indicates the time intervals. The column is designated as ''M'' for the month; e.g., ''M00'' refers to the first month; ''M06'' refers to the sixth month. Features are denoted by ''F'', where ''F1'' refers to the first feature, ''F2'' refers to the second feature, etc. Each subject is scanned multiple times when the maximum of months is 120 months.\nIn data interpolation, for a particular subject, as not all the time intervals have values, subsequent data is required for a full record. (1) In the case of the missing data in row F1, where there is only one value for all the procedures, we assign this feature value to all the time intervals. (2) Linear interpolation is applied to the incomplete data at M36 in row F2. (3) In the case of row F4 (where all the values are missing), we fill the average feature value for the same classification.\nAs AD is a smooth progression of brain atrophy in time series, the missing interval data in case (2) is interpolated in linear. We define the feature as {(x i , t i ); i = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n}, where x i refers to the i-th feature value and t i refers to the i-th time step. Feature sequence is formatted as\nis the missing value to be interpolated, (x i , t i ) and (x j , t j ) are the feature values in time step i and j.\nWhen i < m < j, we interpolate x m as follows:\nWhen x i is the first not null feature value in time step i and 0 < m < i, we interpolate x m as follows:\nWhen x j is the last not null feature value in time step j and j < m < n, we interpolate x m as follows:"}, {"section_title": "IV. AD PREDICTION MODEL AND EVALUATION", "text": "Studies have demonstrated that brain changes associated with AD may begin more than twenty years before symptoms appear [23] - [26] . MRI is a technique used to image the anatomy of the brain. Between two scans, atrophy can be measured by the loss of volume in a particular brain region. It stands to the reason that different brain Regions Of Interest (ROIs) have different disease prediction abilities under the sequence-dependent temporal context. LSTM is a special kind of recurrent neural network, which might be able to connect previous information to the present task. Therefore, an LSTM [27] network, with fully connected and activation layers, is built to encode the temporal relation between features and the next stage of AD. LSTM, with the chain of repeating neural network modules, is designed to avoid the long-term dependency problem. There are four interacting layers in an LSTM neural network, such as ''forget gate'', ''input gate'', ''update gate'', and ''output gate''. The decision whether the information is thrown away from the cell state is made by the ''forget gate'', shown in Eq. 4. The ''input gate'' with a sigmoid layer and a tanh layer decides which values will be updated. The equation is shown in Eq. 5 and Eq. 6. The ''update gate'' in equation Eq. 7. updates the old cell state with the value from the ''input gate''. Finally, the ''output gate'' in equation Eq. 8 and Eq. 9 decides which value is to be output from the layer.\nwhere W f is the weight matrix; b f is the bias vector; and f t is a number between 0 and 1, where 0 represents the forget and 1 represents the keep.\nwhere W i and W C are the weight matrices; b i and b C are the bias vectors; and i t , C t are the outputs of these two equations.\nwhere f t decides which information is to be forgotten, and i t * C t chooses how many values are to be updated for the cell.\nwhere the value of i o in Equation 8 decides which part of the cell state will be the output. The new cell state C t multiplied by o t , and function tanh have selected, to obtain h t in Equation 9, which is the output of the parts i o . As Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is capable of learning long-term dependencies, a model based on LSTM is built to express the progression of AD. In this paper, we create a model that processes the time series data to make the six months' prediction of AD. The proposed model, shown in Figure. 3, involves three layers: the Pre-Fully Connected Layer, Cells Layer, and Post-Fully Connected Layer. The Pre-Fully Connected layer consists of one fully connected layer and a ReLU function; the Cells layer consists of one LSTM layer and a Dropout Wrapper; the Post-Fully Connected layer consists of one fully connected layer and a softmax layer.\nDuring the model training, preprocess sequential data with time steps are fed to the model, and the state of the next six months is predicted by the model. For example, in Figure. 3, the first two steps of O1 (subject O1) time sequential data from the 6-th month to the 12-th month, are fed to the model. The state of the 18-th month, six months after the 12-th month is predicted by the model as ''AD''.\nDuring the model testing, when the 18-th and 24-th month features' data of the subject are fed to the model, the output is the prediction of the subject's state in the 30-th month.\nOne of the most essential evaluation metrics for checking classification model's performance, the Area Under Curve (AUC) is defined as the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. It measures how true positive rate (recall) and false positive rate tradeoff. And multi-class Area Under the receiver operating Curve (mAUC), which is independent of the group sizes, gives an overall measure of classification ability to each class. Our system is evaluated by using AUC/mAUC, where binary-class is accounted for by AUC, and the multi-class is accounted for by mAUC [28] . These measures are defined as follows:\nAUC is the area under the ROC curve, and AUC(c i , c j ) is the AUC of a class c i against the other class c j , defined in Equation 10 as follows:\nn i n j (10) where n i and n j are the total numbers of points belonging to classes i and j, respectively R i is the sum of the ranks of the likelihood belonging to class i. AUC(c i , c j ) [28] is the average AUC(c i , c j ) for classes i and j, defined as\u00c2UC(c i , c j ) = 0.5 * (AUC(c i , c j ) + AUC(c j , c i ) ). While the mAUC [28] is multi-class Area Under the ROC Curve, defined by Equation 11 as follows:\nwhere N is the number of classes; and\u00c2UC(c i , c j ) is the average AUC(c i , c j ) for classes i and j. We evaluate our method by applying it to the MRI data. The goal is to select a compact set of time-sensitive and disease-relevant features while maintaining high predictive power. Specifically, when the brain region features are fed to the model with time series, the most relative combination of features are extracted by Pre-Fully Connected layer. Thereafter, time-sensitive features are selected by the Cells layer. When the features are fed to the Post-Fully Connected layer, the combinations of the time-sensitive features are employed to predict AD.\nWith 5-fold cross-validation, based on prediction, following parameters are fixed to adjust the network structure of our model in the experiments: batch_size as 256, the learning_rate as 1e-4, the type of cell as LSTM Cell, the number of pre-fully connected cells as 512, the number of post-fully connected cells as 3 and keep_prob as 0.8. Furthermore, to find the best parameters, we tune our model with the following parameters: the number of the fully connected cells, the number of LSTM cells, and the number of LSTM layers. Experiments of three classes prediction on AD vs MCI vs NC show that the model achieves the best mAUC when the number of fully connected cells is 512, and the number of LSTM layers is 2. The results in Table 1 show that our model achieves the best mAUC when the number of LSTM cells is 128."}, {"section_title": "V. EXPERIMENT", "text": "Studies have demonstrated that brain changes associated with AD may begin more than twenty years before symptoms appear [23] - [26] . Multiple symptoms reflect the degree of damage to neurons in different parts of the brain, where VOLUME 7, 2019 symptoms advance from mild to moderate, varies from person to person [1] . In this work, we consider the prediction states of AD after six months. As a result, the subject's states of next six month are labeled as the prediction status. The performance of the model is evaluated by the binary prediction tasks (e.g., AD vs NC, MCI vs NC, and AD vs MCI) and multi-prediction tasks (e.g., AD vs NC vs MCI).\nFirstly, we preprocessed the data with time steps and used a five folds cross-validation technique for all methods. Typically, we randomly partitioned the data into five subsets. Then, we selected one subset for testing and the rest four subsets for training.\nTo compare our algorithm with other state-of-the-art methods, we selected Zhu [13] from the first method, Lin [19] and Amoroso [20] from the second and third method. Zhu [13] uses the Discriminative Self-representation Sparse Regression to select features and an SVM classifier to make the classification. In Lin [19] , a Random Forest (RF) is undertaken to select features, and the Deep Neural Network (DNN) is adopted to classify the disease. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) along with PCA-LASSO in Amoroso [20] is designed to select features, and the SVM is adopted to classify the disease.\nAll the experiments are taken in tensorflow software environment and one GPU 1060i Nvidia card in the hardware environment. We use five-fold cross-validation for all the methods. The results show that our model achieves a significant improvement over all compared approaches in prediction. Based on all the features of Longitudinal MRI data, including 900 AD, 900 MCI, and 900 NC, the comparison with other methods in Table 2 shows that our algorithm achieves the best AUC/mAUC in most of the predictions. Specifically, AUC is 0.935 for AD vs NC, 0.798 for AD vs MCI and mAUC is 0.777 for AD vs NC vs MCI. Our method achieves the last rank in the prediction for MCI vs NC, when AUC is 0.697, because the data set of NC vs MCI is not able to distinguish the MCI converting to AD from the MCI staying stable.\nThe proposed method aims to identify time relative biomarkers associated with disease status. Five biomarkers identified by medical science are listed as follows: cortical Thickness Standard deviation (TS), cortical Thickness Average (TA), WM Parcellation Volume (SV), Surface Area (SA), and Cortical parcellation Volume (CV). Among those five features, TA is the identification of gross atrophy in the cerebral cortex and certain subcortical regions. According to neuropathology, AD is characterized by loss of neurons and synapses in the cerebral cortex and certain subcortical regions, resulting in gross atrophy of the affected regions. By comparing these five different features extracted from the MRI image, the experimental results of our model (see Table 3 ) show that the TA feature outperforms other features in most of the classification task, which means that TA is a distinct feature to predict the progression of AD.\nTo test the stability of our algorithm, we compare the AUC/mAUC of data sizes from 400 numbers to 900 numbers. The results based on TA features in Figure. 4 show that our algorithm is stable with varying data sizes for all the predictions.\nBased on varying data sizes, including data sizes from 400 to 900, the AUC/mAUC comparison with different feature types is taken in Figure. achieves the best performance in AUC/mAUC among those features. According to the neuropathology, the AD accompanied by the gross atrophy of cerebral cortex and certain subcortical regions, which is identified by the TA feature."}, {"section_title": "VI. CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper, a deep learning model is introduced to predict the development of AD. Noticing that the disease is inherently progressive, the temporal information collected from the cases is considered in the model. Compared with existing approaches, our model can carry out the future state prediction for the disease, rather than classify the state of a current diagnosis. Experiments show that the performance of our model is much better than most of the existing approaches. Besides, our method is table for different data size. At the same time, the results also show that the Cortical Thickness Average (TA) feature is a significant feature to predict the progression of AD.
