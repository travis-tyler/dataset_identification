[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Disease outbreaks from around the world, particularly BSE, or \"mad cow disease\", motivated USDA to initiate a program for identifying animals so that disease outbreaks in the U.S. could be quickly traced back to the source. \u2022 This program evolved over time into the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). \u2022 The NAIS was a voluntary program intended to help protect U.S. livestock and poultry from disease spread, maintain consumer confidence in the food supply, and retain access to domestic and foreign markets. The foundation of the NAIS and first step for producer participation was premises registration. \u2022 To register a premises, producers must have contacted the appropriate State or Tribal authority and provided contact information for the premises and minimal information about the livestock operation. \u2022 Providing premises information means that producers would be notified quickly when a disease event might impact their area or animal species (USDA, APHIS, 2007)."}, {"section_title": "The NAIS and Beef Cow-Calf Production", "text": "Despite relatively wide acceptance by hog and poultry producers, implementation of the NAIS was met with significant resistance among U.S. beef cow-calf producers. \u2022 Beef cow-calf producers were concerned about their liability in the event of a disease outbreak and their cost of implementing the program (Breiner et. al.). \u2022 Due in part to resistance among many of the nearly 765,000 U.S. beef cow-calf producers, the NAIS was replaced in February 2010 with a framework that calls for less federal oversight and leaves States to choose their own degree of within-state animal identification and livestock traceability."}, {"section_title": "This presentation examines:", "text": "\u2022 the extent to which commercial beef cow-calf producers were familiar with and registered with the NAIS, and \u2022 farm and operator characteristics of beef cow-calf producers according to their familiarity and registration with the NAIS."}, {"section_title": "Data and Methods", "text": "During March of 2009, USDA conducted a national survey of U.S. beef cow-calf producers as part of the annual Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS). \u2022 The survey targeted \"commercial\" beef cow-calf operations in 22 States [ fig. 1], defined as those with at least 20 beef cows on the operation at any time during 2008. \u2022 Limiting the target population to those with 20 or more beef cows omitted about 53 percent of farms with beef cows, but included about 90 percent of the beef cow inventory (USDA, NASS). \u2022 Beef cow-calf producers were asked if they were familiar with the NAIS and if so, were they registered in the NAIS. Producers were classified into: 1) those not familiar with the NAIS, 2) those familiar, but not registered in the NAIS, and 3) those registered in the NAIS."}, {"section_title": "Major Findings", "text": "\u2022 About 24 percent of beef cow-calf producers with more than 20 cows in 2008 were not familiar with the NAIS. Another 52 percent were familiar with the NAIS, but had not registered their premises. The remaining 24 percent of beef cow-calf producers had premises registered with the NAIS [ fig.2]. This is greater than 16 percent reported from the National Animal Health Monitoring Survey (USDA, APHIS, 2008) due to the 20 cow minimum in the ARMS population. \u2022 Size of cow-calf operation was associated with both familiarity and registration with the NAIS. Nearly a third of cow-calf operations with 20 to 49 beef cows were not familiar with the NAIS and only 16 percent of these small operations had premises registered. Among operations with 1,000 or more beef cows only 9 percent were not familiar with the NAIS and nearly half were registered [ fig. 3]. \u2022 Cow-calf producers not familiar with the NAIS were about 5 years older, on average, than other producers and nearly 50 percent were more than 65 years of age. Producers registered with the NAIS were more educated than other producers as a third had graduated from college, compared with 17 percent not familiar with the NAIS. \u2022 Farm incomes of cow-calf producers registered in the NAIS were much higher than those of other producers. Net cash farm income and net farm income were more than 3 times higher than for those not familiar with the NAIS [ fig. 4]. \u2022 Information technologies were more often used by beef cow-calf producers registered in the NAIS. More than 60 percent of these producers kept individual cow records, 30 percent kept on-farm computer records for beef cattle, and about half used the internet to obtain beef cattle information, all much higher than among other cow-calf producers [fig. 5]. \u2022 More than 80 percent of beef cow-calf producers used methods for identifying cattle, including more than 90 percent of those registered in the NAIS and nearly 70 percent of those not familiar with the NAIS [ fig. 6]. Visual ear tagging and branding were the most common methods used to identify beef cattle."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "\u2022 Despite that the NAIS and its predecessors were initially drafted as early as 2002, many commercial beef cow-calf producers were not familiar with the program and only about a quarter had their premises registered by 2008. This suggests that federal or State efforts to enhance traceability through animal identification need to do a better job of informing producers about program benefits, as well as addressing producer concerns. \u2022 The large number of small beef cow-calf operations, their limited registration with the NAIS, and their limited farm financial resources, suggests that participation costs could be an impediment to participation in animal identification systems by many producers. Methods for reducing these costs may need to involve subsidizing participation for small operations, or finding a way to utilize those animal identification systems currently in place on most beef cow-calf operations. \u2022 The use of information technologies was associated with producer participation in the NAIS. Increasing producer involvement in production record keeping programs and expanding internet access in rural areas may also help to improve participation in animal identification programs. Only Only 16 percent of ARMS beef cow-calf producers with 20-49 beef cows were registered with the NAIS, compared with nearly half of those with 1,000 cows or more "}, {"section_title": "fig. 3", "text": "Net cash and net farm income for beef cow-calf producers registered in the NAIS were much higher than for other producers "}]
