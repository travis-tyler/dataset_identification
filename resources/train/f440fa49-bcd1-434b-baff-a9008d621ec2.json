[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In empirical estimation of total factor productivity, it is common to adopt proxy measures for outputs/inputs due to lack of pertinent data and/or ignorance of relevant information (Griliches, 1957). In this paper, we attempt to ascertain the consequences in the estimation of raw milk production functions of: (1) Not having detailed input use data; (2) Ignoring output (i.e., component composition) quality differences; and (3) Quantify the effect on total factor productivity evaluation. As an application, we focus on U.S. dairy production. The absence of detailed input utilization data is a common problem in raw milk production function estimation. In most datasets related to dairy production, there is lack of information concerning the use of unpaid labor and the amount of homegrown feed provided. The standard practice is to ignore these input factors and only use data on paid labor and purchased feed, respectively. It is imperative to incorporate the relevant inputs in analysis of production function as ignoring relevant inputs will reduce variation in productivity estimates. It is also a source of potential bias in the estimation of the production coefficients associated with other inputs if the values of the included inputs are correlated with the omitted inputs. In the production function literature, it usually assumed that outputs are homogenous and therefore the same quality across observations. In the production of milk at the farm level milk output is measured in cwt units. 1 Under current FMMO and California minimum pricing systems, the milk from different farms may have substantially different values per cwt due to differences farm-specific milk compositions: milkfat, protein and other solids and the health status of the average cow as represented by the milk's Somatic Cell Count 2 (SCC). USDA and CA published classified milk prices are defined per cwt of standard milk with a specified solids composition. These composition differences are due to a number of factors including differences in: (1) Dairy cow breed; (2) Feed composition; (3) Number of lactations experienced by the cow; (4) Genetic background; (5) Climatic conditions; and (6) Other farm management choices. Of the above factors, the breed of cow is the one of the most important determinants of milk composition differences across farms. In Table 1, we use average 2016 Class III (i.e., hard cheese) milk to value the average breed-specific component and total milk value across breed. Based on average 2016 commodity prices, we find as much as a 25% difference in milk values across breed. Obviously, the observed differences will vary depending on relative commodity price averages. This means that two farm neighbors shipping their raw milk to the same processing plant may receive substantially different revenue per cwt if there are differences in the composition of that milk. When attempting to maximizing profits, the dairy farm operator must be concerned with the differences in the valuation of milk components in the local area. This means that in terms of examining the productivity of raw milk production, milk quality needs to be recognized. This implies that dairy farm operators make production decisions not only with respect to the amount of milk to produce (i.e., cwt of milk) but also the quality of that milk with the objective of increasing the revenue obtained from raw milk production. Given that unit value of milk will differ across dairy farms due to component and SCC concentrations, we need to develop a quality-adjusted measure of milk production. The objective of the paper is two-fold. The first objective is to quantify the contribution of unpaid labor and homegrown feed to a dairy farm's production and productivity. This is made possible via the use of a panel dataset of U.S. dairy farms developed from the 2000, 2005 and 2010 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS). The data is constructed by following the method in Weber et al. (2016). To our knowledge, this is the first paper using detailed input and output data of ARMS to investigate dairy farm productivity in a panel data setting. Information on farm inputs including unpaid labor and homegrown feed allows us to investigate dynamic changes in factor productivity across dairy farms. A novel structural model is adopted to control for endogeneity in production function estimation. The second objective of this paper is to obtain quality-adjusted productivity measures. We adopt and compare two methods of output quality adjustment. The first approach is the use of the revenue function, instead of physical quantity as output measure. We deflate farm-level dairy revenue by uniform milk price of the Federal Milk Marketing Order (FMMO) dairy farms locate and adopt it as a measure of output in production function estimation. Assuming dairy farmers are price takers within a milk pricing system, price premium relative to the FMMO uniform milk price is used as a proxy of milk quality in this method. The second approach adjusts output quality by generating a quality index based on milk attributes such as components (i.e., milkfat, protein, other solids) and SCC. Our results indicate that incorporating unpaid labor and homegrown feed in production function estimation has significant effect on our productivity assessments. After the correction, dairy farm with less proportion of input from unpaid labor and homegrown feed yield higher productivity estimates. Quality adjustment of outputs measures also generates a significant change in the distribution of productivity for this farm panel. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we review the method of Levinsohn and Petrin (2003, LP) in the estimation of production function while controlling for input use endogeneity. In Section 3 we present information about the newly constructed panel dataset and some descriptive statistics of dairy farm production characteristics. We document and discuss the empirical results in Section 4 and the conclusion is presented in Section 5."}, {"section_title": "Estimation Issues When Evaluating Empirical Milk Production Functions", "text": "In this section, we discuss the potential bias sources and theoretical implications for milk production function. We propose empirical methods to quantify these biases and to implement procedures that will generate unbiased parameter estimates. Table 2 provides detailed information about different estimated regression models. A dairy farmer i at period t is assumed to sell Q units of milk with five inputs: labor (L), capital (K), intermediate input (M ), feed (H) and annual average herd (C). Consider a Cobb-Douglas production function: Taking logarithms of each side yields the log form as: is a set of parameters to estimate. it represent measurement error and idiosyncratic shocks with mean zero. It refers to shocks to production that are not observed or predicted by farms when making input decisions.\u03c9 it represents total factor productivity (TFP), which is our main variable of interest.\u03c9 it refers to a farm specific shock to productivity, which is potentially observed or predicted by farms when making input decisions. For instance, the total factor productivity, \u03c9 it , is related to management skills of a farm, expectation of machine breakdown or anticipation of rainfall at farm-specific location (Ackerberg et al., 2015). The potential correlation between production inputs and \u03c9 it brings up an endogeneity problem in production function estimation (Marschak and Andrews, 1944). More productive farms may tend to adopt more inputs in production, hence input choice is correlated with productivity, specified as part of the error term."}, {"section_title": "Controlling for Input Use Endogeneity in Production Function Estimation", "text": "To deal with the endogeneity problem discussed above, we adopt the methods proposed by Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) so as to obtain consistent estimation of production function coefficients and total factor productivity (TFP), \u03c9 it . The LP method for productivity measurement uses intermediate material demand (m it ) as a proxy for productivity, the optimal amount of which is determined by m it = h t (k it , c it , \u03c9 it ). Assuming function h t is strictly increasing in \u03c9 it , we have \u03c9 it = h \u22121 t (k it , c it , m it ). Substituting this into the production function in Equation 1and collecting terms, we have: is a flexible functional form for which we adopt a third-order polynomial approximation. Productivity is assumed to follow the law of motion: \u03c9 it = g t (\u03c9 it\u22121 ) + \u03be it . \u03be it denotes an innovation to productivity that is uncorrelated with state variables at period t, such as k it and c it . After obtaining the unexpected innovation, \u03be it , in productivity, the Standard Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) method is applied to the following moment condition to obtain estimates of \u03b2 k ,\u03b2 c and \u03b2 m . 2.2 Implications of Unpaid labor and Homegrown Feed Data Absence In this section, we discuss the effect of input factor absence on production function estimates and total factor productivity evaluation. In most datasets related to dairy production, there is lack of information about unpaid labor and homegrown feed. The standard practice is to ignore these input factors and only use data on paid labor and purchased feed. In dairy production, there are mainly two sources of labor inputs: paid labor (LP ) and unpaid labor (LU ), L = LP + LU . Similarly, feed usually comes from purchased feed (F P ) and homegrown feed (F H), F = F P + F H. The production function in the log form can be written as: The first line in equation 4represents correct production function estimation including data about all labor and feed devoted. The second line specifies the function estimated when only data about paid labor and purchased feed are used. is the corresponding vector of parameters to estimate and lf it is the i.i.d error term with mean zero. Excluding an input variable in production function estimation will bring an upward bias on input elasticity for included input that is positive associated with the excluded factor, and a downward bias for those negatively associated with the excluded factor (Griliches, 1957). When data for unpaid labor and homegrown feed are ignored, they will be left in the residuals, \u03c9 lf it = \u03c9 it + \u03b2 lf lu lu it + \u03b2 lf f h f h it . It increases the average productivity level. We can see that under this estimation, dairy farms with unpaid labor and homegrown feed will yield a higher value of measured productivity."}, {"section_title": "Adjustment for Output Quality in Production Function Estimation", "text": "We specify two methods to incorporate output quality adjustments to our measure of milk production. The first method employs the use of a revenue function instead of a physical measure of output (i.e. cwt of milk). Assuming that, dairy market in the U.S. is competitive and dairy farm operators are price takers, we assume that a milk price dispersion in a particular month mainly comes from quality differences and differences in the relative amount of milk used in each Class. In our second method, we generate a milk quality index based on milk component composition and Somatic Cell Count. Under this method our output measure is defined as the quantity of milk sold adjusted by this quality index."}, {"section_title": "Revenue Function Estimation", "text": "In revenue function, the output variable is deflated revenue from milk ( r it ), calculated as farm milk revenue (R it ) divided by uniform milk price 3 (P f t ) under the Federal Milk Marketing Orders (FMMO) the dairy farm locates in. We have R it = R it P f t = R it P it * P it P f t = Q it P it P f t . Since dairy market in the U.S. is competitive and farms are price takers, we assume that milk price dispersion mainly comes from quality differences and various utilization of a producer's milk. Therefore, price of milk with the same quality is assumed to be identical under the same milk pricing system. We hence propose to proxy milk quality by milk price premium, which is simplified here as P it P f t . The revenue function in log form of our production function can be represented as: where r it = r it \u2212 p f t represents the log of deflated revenue from milk."}, {"section_title": "Development of a Milk Quality Index", "text": "We developed a quality index based on method proposed by Atsbeha et al. (2012) to adjust our output measure given that the value per cwt of milk is dependent on milk solids composition and SCC. Let V it represents the per cwt unit value of milk for farm i at period t, which is calculated as revenue from milk divided by total cwt of milk sold, i.e. V it = R it Q it . The milk value is linearly related to milk's physical characteristics: percent composition of butterfat (I f at it ) and protein (I protein it ) 4 . Quality of milk also depends on somatic cell count of producer milk relative to a base level of 350,000 cells per ml (Jesse and Cropp, 2008). Milk with somatic cell count below or above this base will receive premium or deduct based on the difference from standard. Let I scc it denotes producer's somatic cell count in thousands. We generate a relationship between milk value and these attributes: where \u03b7 it is a white noise error, \u03b7 it \u223c N (0, \u03c3 \u03b7 ). Given the estimation of the coefficients in Equation (6), we can obtain a farm-specific predicted unit milk valueV it . LetV represents the unit value for average quality milk, whereV protein it +\u03b1 3 (\u012a scc it \u2212 350). We generate the ratioV it V as an index for milk quality. This quality index incorporates milk quality attributes with linear effects (Atsbeha et al., 2012). If a farm produces milk with average quality in the sample, the quality index equals one. If the value of quality index is more than one, it indicates a farm produces high-quality milk, while less than one value indicates low milk quality. The second quality adjustment component is generated to control for nonlinear effects of milk quality attributes. Milk quality may be correlated with factors other than the three specified in the linear effect. Observed farm-specific milk price, V it , can be different even two dairy farms with same value of quality attributes. We compute the minimum unit value of milk based on quality attributes, P c it = P f at I f at it + P protein I protein it + P scc I scc it , P f at , P protein and P scc here are milk components value used in milk pricing 5 . To account for unobserved quality differentials, we develop the ratio V it P c it to account for nonlinear effects of milk quality. More than one value of this ratio indicates milk produced by dairy farm i yields better quality than the average milk with the same quality attributes. A value less than one indicates the milk produced is priced less than averaged among milk with same quality attributes, hence quality is worse than milk with same quality attributes. We combine the two quality indexes to specified above and adjust quantity of milk with respect to quality differentials. The milk quality index for farm i at period t is therefore specified as SupposeQ it = \u03d5 it Q it , this adjustment transforms observed milk quantity into measurement with equivalent milk quality. The log form is specified asq it = ln q it + ln \u03d5 it . The quality adjusted production function can be written as: 3 Description of Dairy Farm Data The primary objective of our analysis is to quantify the contribution of unpaid labor and homegrown feed in the evaluation of US dairy farms' productivity, where the raw milk output has been quality adjusted. To undertake this analysis, we constructed a farm-level panel dataset containing the production history of a set of U.S. dairy farms. This panel was constructed from the cross-sectional Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) for the years 2000, 2005 and 2010 6 . Although the ARMS data series is designed as cross-sectional survey of a representative sample of farms, there are dairy farms interviewed in more than one survey. Since each farm is assigned a unique principal operator identifier (OPID), we can identify farms that are sampled at least twice in the survey (Weber et al., 2016). To our knowledge, this is the first paper using such detailed variables in inputs and outputs of US dairy production in a panel data perspective. For this analysis, we use farms that were interviewed in at least 2 consecutives (i.e., 00/05, 05/10 or 00/05/10). This panel setting enables us to conduct production function estimation with control of endogeneity issue using lagged input value as proxy. Table 3 presents the distribution of sampled dairy farms used in this analysis. There are total of 4,268 distinct farms interviewed in at least one of the above 3 surveys. Less than 7% of surveyed farms (i.e., 286 farms) were surveyed for at least two consecutive years. The 286 farms resulted in 606 observations in our panel data set 7 . The ARMS survey contains information about farm and operator characteristics, cost, returns, production and management activities (Dubman, 2000). In terms of variables related to raw milk production, the survey includes quantity of milk production and revenue obtained from the marketed milk. There is also detailed data as to the use of unpaid labor and homegrown feed. Data related to milk component composition (i.e., fat, protein and SCC) is reported in 2005, which allows us to quality adjust milk production. However, data related to milk component composition is not available in 2000 or 2010. In production function estimation with quality index method, we are only left with 73 observations in 2005 to obtain parameters of production function 8 and productivity of 297 observations in 2005 can be recovered under this method. Table 4 compares the production scales and input utilization of selected panel and the whole sample. Values of the whole sample are weighted based on each year's weights assigned, while those for selected farms are based on unweighted data 9 . The production scale of selected farms is relatively large than the whole sample, especially in the data of 2000. Table 5 presents the descriptive statistics of input and output variables used in production function estimation on an aggregate year-specific (Panel A) as well as per cow basis (Panel B). The average herd size (number of milking cows) is 374 cows in the sample, it ranges from 13 to 6,499 cows. The quantity of milk sold averaged 6,674,500 lbs per farm. The range in milk production ranges from 130,000 lbs to 124,931,500 lbs. The annual milk sold per cow is 152 cwt. Average milk-based revenue averaged $1,134,042 per farm and $2,839 per cow. Average total labor used directly in milk production was devoted to dairy production averaged 19,353 hours and 68 hours/cow. Less than 40% of the labor input was obtained from paid labor. Feed use is converted to the feeding of total digestible nutrients (TDN) using feed conversion coefficients found in Macgregor (2000). TDNs represent the sum of digestible fiber, protein, lipid, and carbohydrate components of a feedstuff or feed ration. It is directly related to digestible energy and is often calculated based on acid detergent fiber (ADF) content. The TDN of feed use on average is 64,017 cwt, accounting to 174 cwt on per cow basis. The allocation in purchased and homegrown feed varies across different scales of dairy farms with about 41% comes from purchased feed. The capital cost includes expenditures on machinery and cars used in dairy production. farms were interviewed in 2 consecutive years, which contributes to 570 observations in the selected panel sample. In total, there are 297 distinctive dairy farms and 606 observations in the selected panel data. 8 Control function requires available information of intermediate input from last period, hence only farms being interviewed in both 2000 and 2005 can be used in estimation, which yields 73 observations. 9 Since the original weights are designed for cross-section data, not for panel patterns, they are not suitable for generated panel samples. Since the capital value is reported in aggregate farm level, we allocate it to dairy based on revenue share from milk production. The average devoted is $200,898, accounting to $1,366/cow. Material input here is total of the expenses on fuels, electricity, medical supplies, veterinary and custom services devoted to dairy production. The average cost is $121,787. Expenditures on capital and material are deflated by price index for US agricultural inputs (Economic Research Service, 2015). 4 Evaluation of the Productivity of U.S. Dairy Farms"}, {"section_title": "Estimation of Production Function", "text": "The estimation of production function is undertaken using seven alternative methods (i.e., A-E) and estimated coefficients shown in Table 6. We compare estimation results from models (A-D) with all observations in Table 6a. Model (A) is estimated via the used of OLS. Under the OLS specification, cross-sectional variation in input use is needed to identify input coefficients as more productive farms tend to be larger and likely to use more labor, feed and intermediate inputs. The coefficients associated with (B) are estimated using the Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) method. The results indicate that OLS tends to generate upward bias on non-capital inputs. Coefficients on capital inputs are not significant under two models. Production function in Model (C) is estimated excluding homegrown feed and unpaid labor. Compared with Model (B), missing data in input factors yields smaller value for the corresponding coefficient, that is to say the coefficients for labor and feed tend to be underestimate. It can substantially decrease the measured return to scale. Table 6b compares the estimation results from model (A), (B), (D) and (E) only with observations in 2005. Output specified in Model (B) only incorporates the total quantity of milk sold without including the effect of output quality variation. Model (D) and (E) are estimated with adjustment of output quality, using revenue function and quality index respectively. Comparing with Model (B), changes of input coefficients are consistent for both methods. With consideration of output quality, the output elasticities of feed and capital increase and the output elasticity of herd size decrease. For the coefficient of labor input, quality adjustment by revenue function yields a lower value compare to OLS, while coefficient of labor input is not significant using quality index method. Coefficient of intermediate input is not significant. The return to scales significantly decreases under quality adjustment methods."}, {"section_title": "Evaluation of Total Factor Productivity", "text": "Comparison of total factor productivity estimated from different models are shown in Table  7. Figure 1(a) presents comparison of the kernel density of total factor productivity between models with different inputs measures (Model (B), (C), (F) and (G)). Figure 1(b) presents comparison between models with or without output quality adjustment (Model (B), (D) and (E)). The mean of estimated productivity increases when either one of or both homegrown feed and unpaid labor inputs are excluded in the production function. This is due to the omission of relevant variables are left into residuals, which increases the mean of productivity. Variance of productivity decreases when excluding inputs in unpaid labor, while the variance increases with exclusion of homegrown feed. Total factor productivity estimated with quality adjustment has higher mean as well as more variance. It's obvious that productivity from revenue function is more skewed to the right, that's to say under this method, some farms are measured to be more productive than average."}, {"section_title": "Who are more misidentified with omission of relevant inputs and output quality differentials?", "text": "Above results have shown that productivity measured from different methods are significantly different in distributions as well as ranking across observations. We are interested in investigating productivity of which type of dairy farms are more misidentified with omission of relevant inputs (9) as well as with omission of output quality differentials (Table 10). In both tables, the dependent variables are the difference between productivity estimated from different models. Independent variables are dairy farms characteristics that are relevant to dairy production. In this way, we can identify the heterogenous effects of different estimation methods on dairy farms. As hypothesized in empirical model section, excluding input factors such as unpaid labor and homegrown feed will raise the measured productivity, especially for dairy farms with more proportion of inputs from the omitted factors. The dependent variable in the first column of Table 8 is productivity difference between Model E and B, which measures the magnitude of misidentification in productivity due to excluding data of unpaid labor and homegrown feed. The results indicate that ratio of labor input from unpaid labor and ratio of feed input from homegrown are positively correlated with measured productivity difference. Homegrown feed and purchased feed are substitute inputs in dairy production, if data of homegrown feed is not included in production function estimation, the productivity of farms with relatively high ratio of homegrown feed will be overestimated, while productivity is underestimated for those dairy farms using less homegrown feed. The case for paid and unpaid labor is similar since the substation relationship. Productivity of dairy farms using more family labor tend to be overestimated and vice versa. Dependent variable in the second column is the difference between productivity measures excluding and including unpaid labor. The coefficient of herd size is positive and statistically significant and the coefficient for organic dummy variable is significantly positive as well. It indicates that dairy farms with relative large size and organic dairy farms may have large proportion of labor devoted from unpaid labor, hence the productivity are more overestimated. Negative and statistically significant coefficient of the revenue ratio from dairy production shows that farms that are less specialized in dairy are assigned a higher productivity when excluding unpaid labor input. Employing auto take-off equipment in milking helps to save labor inputs, the corresponding coefficient is negative and statistically significant. Dairy farms with adoption of auto take-off tend to use less unpaid labor and hence the bias is relatively smaller. Similar to the regression of unpaid labor, analysis of productivity difference with regard to homegrown feed is presented in the third column of 9. The coefficient of the revenue ratio from dairy production is positive and statistically significant. Farms that are more specialized in dairy production have a relatively large proportion of feed from homegrown, hence ignoring this input source will attribute a greater productivity to farms with higher proportion of revenue from dairy production. Table 10 specifies what types of dairy farms are most likely to be miscategorized without quality adjustment. Both revenue function and quality index methods are analyzed. Dairy farms with more dairy cows tend to produce higher quality of milk. Therefore, incorporating milk quality in estimation will help to increase the measured productivity of large dairy farms. The coefficient of organic dairy farm is positive and statistically significant, indicating that milk produced by organic dairy farms are of high quality, hence the productivity without quality adjustment is underestimated. Results using quality index adjustment are consistent."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion and Discussion", "text": "The objective of this paper is to ascertain the consequences of omitting relevant inputs variables and output quality differentials in the estimation of production function and investigate the implication for total factor productivity evaluation. Specifically, in the analysis of U.S. dairy farms production, we quantity the contribution of unpaid labor and homegrown feed in production function and propose methods of output quality adjustment. Total factor productivity is recovered from the production function with control of endogeneity issue. We also analyze the heterogenous effects of input and output misidentification on dairy farms with distinct characteristics. Data employed in this analysis is the newly constructed panel dataset of the U.S. dairy sector from the Agricultural Resource Management Surveys (ARMS) in 2000, 2005 and 2010. ARMS data incorporates detailed information about quantity as well as monetary measures of inputs and output in dairy production. Moreover, panel structure of the generated data allows us to investigate dynamic changes in factor productivity across dairy farms. We first estimate and compare the production function with various measure of inputs. Omission of relevant input variables results in a higher mean of total factor productivity. The variance of productivity decreases without incorporating unpaid labor inputs, while the variance increases with ignorance of homegrown feed. Secondly, we adopt two methods, revenue function and quality index, in order to conduct milk quality adjustment in production function estimation. Results indicate escalation of productivity mean and variance. We then investigate the productivity of which types of dairy farms is more misidentified by the omission of relevant inputs or output quality. Consistent with theoretical hypothesis, productivity of farms with more proportion of inputs from unpaid labor or homegrown feed generates an upward bias with omission of the corresponding inputs. Dairy farm with large herd size and organic farms tend to yield a larger deviation of productivity when excluding unpaid labor or output quality.    27 observations from the all data sample are excluded due to extremely large value for feed inputs. 1 Number of observations is 73. 2 Standard errors in parentheses; 3 * significant at 10%; ** significant at 5%; *** significant at 1%;  "}]
