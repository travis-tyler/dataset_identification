Four years later, in 1971, the annual total topped 30,000 (31,867) for the first time. The decades of the 1970s and 1980s saw periods of more modest increases, and in 7 of those 20 years annual totals even declined. The total figure did not exceed 40,000 until 1994 (41,034), 23 years after it had reached the 30,000 plateau; not until 1989 did the annual total 34,327 exceed the previous high-water mark of 33,755 set in 1973. Over the past few years, the annual rates of increase have become smaller than they were in the first half of the decade of the 1990s, including gains of only 0.3 percent per year for both 1997 and 1998; thus the 1999 total number of doctorates is approximately the same as it was five years ago (41,140 versus 41,034). (See figures 1 and 2.) Overall in 1999, 57 percent of the doctorate recipients were male, about two-thirds were U.S. citizens, approximately 64 percent were white, and about 6 in 10 recipients were currently married or living in a marriage-like relationship. The typical recipient was slightly under 34 years of age at the time the degree was awarded. (Detailed statistics are provided in the tables and discussed later in this report.) 3 Doctorates are reported by academic year (from July 1 of one year through June 30 of the following year) and include research and applied research doctorates in all fields. Doctoral degrees such as the Ph.D., D.Sc., and Ed.D. are covered by this survey; professional degrees (e.g., M.D., D.D.S., J.D., Psy.D.) are not. A full list of included degrees can be found in appendix E. For convenience throughout this report, the terms \"Ph.D.\" or \"doctorate\" are used to represent any of the research doctoral degrees covered by the survey. Please note that if an individual earned a second research doctorate, the second doctorate is not included in the SED.  Texas-Austin granted the most doctorates in the heterogeneous \"professional/other\" category (51). See table 3 for the top 20 ranked institutions for each of the seven broad fields. The numbers of doctorates awarded by broad field are also concentrated in a relatively small number of institutions. While the top 10 degree-granting universities awarded 15.6 percent of all doctorates in 1999, the concentration was higher in six of the seven broad fields: 19.5 percent in the physical sciences, 28.1 percent in engineering, 18.7 percent in the life sciences, 22.9 percent in the humanities, 21.7 percent in education, and 17.0 percent in the professional/other category. Only in the social sciences was the concentration lower than the overall average (14.8 percent). See table 3. As shown in figure 3 and table 4, California universities led the nation by awarding 4,724 doctorates, or 11.5 percent of all doctorates in 1999. New York institutions granted the next highest number of doctorates (3,511), followed by institutions in Texas (2,697), Illinois (2,20I ), Massachusetts (2,132), Pennsylvania (2,115), Florida (1,944), and Ohio (1,638). These eight states accounted for more than half 51.0 percent of all doctorates awarded in 1999.   Table 4.

For presentation purposes here, these are grouped into seven broad fields: physical sciences,5 engineering, life sciences,6 social sciences (including psychology), humanities, education, and a heterogeneous group of professional and other fields (including business, communications, social work and theological programs). Information about the levels and trends in these broad fields is of particular interest to Federal sponsors of doctoral research, academic administrators, and professional associations, among others. These groups rely on these data to make informed decisions that influence graduate education and the nation's labor force. The overall decrease of 3.6 percent in doctorates awarded between the 1998 and 1999 academic years occurred across the board: all seven broad field categories experienced declines in the absolute number of degrees, with engineering and the physical sciences registering the largest percentage drops, 9.8 percent and 6.2 percent, respectively. The social sciences, humanities, and education showed the smallest decreases. The life sciences, with 8,126 doctorates, remained the largest single broad field, as it has since 1988. Compared with five years ago (1994), when the total number of doctorates awarded was approximately the same as it was in 1999, engineering and the physical sciences showed large decreases: 8.3 percent and 7.3 percent lower in 1999 than in 1994, respectively.' Humanities registered the largest percentage increase from 1994 to 1999, with 15.3 percent more degrees awarded in 1999 than five years earlier. The life sciences (+5.0 percent) and social sciences (+6.4 percent) were also higher in 1999; education was 2.2 percent lower. (See table 5.) The four broad fields that together constitute \"science and engineering\" (S&E) physical, life, and social sciences plus engineeringrepresented 65.2 percent of all doctorates awarded in 1999. Ten years ago (1989) they accounted for approximately the same percentage of all doctorates (65.0 percent), but compared with 25 years ago (1974), the S&E fields represent 5 The physical sciences include mathematics and computer sciences, as well as the traditional physical science disciplines. 6 The life sciences encompass biological, agricultural, and medical sciences. 7 The smaller, heterogeneous \"professional/other\" category registered the largest percentage decrease between 1994 and 1999, 11.4 percent."}, {"section_title": "7", "text": "1r\u00b0' a larger percentage of total degrees in 1999 than in 1974 (57.4 percent). (See table 5.) However, these combined S&E fields showed a 5.1 percent decrease between 1998 and 1999 and a 0.6 percent smaller total in 1999 than in 1994. Of the 26 subfields included in table 5, 19 experienced declines in number of doctorates awarded between 1998 and 1999. Within the S&E category, only two subfields --both in the social sciences --had gains; the other 13 S&E subfields showed declines between these two academic years. Comparing 1994 with 1999, 12 of the 26 subfields had larger absolute numbers of doctorates in 1999, and 14 had smaller numbers; within S&E fields in these same two years, 6 subfields had larger totals in 1999 than in 1994, and 9 had smaller ones. For both the one-year and five-year comparisons within S&E, the physics and astronomy subfields displayed the largest declines and anthropology the biggest gains. Comparing a slightly different set of subfields see table 6 over a 10-year interval between 1989 and 1999, the three disciplines with the largest percentage increases were neuroscience (141.4 percent), cell biology (114.3 percent), and history (87.9 percent).

For males there was a 4.8 percent decline; for females, only a 2.0 percent drop. The numbers of doctorates awarded both to men and to women fell in 1999: 1,193 fewer men and 363 fewer women received doctorates in 1999 than in 1998. The net effect is that for 1999, females received 42.7 percent of all doctorates, up from 42.0 percent in 1998, which had been the highest percentage ever for women.8 This marks the fourth consecutive year in which the representation of female doctorate recipients has exceeded 40 percent. With respect to the distribution by sex of doctorates across broad fields of study, for 1999 women constituted 64.2 percent of all education doctorates, the majority in the social sciences (54.5 percent), and almost half in the humanities (48.9 percent). By contrast, the representation of females among doctorate recipients in the physical sciences and engineering for 1999 was only 23.4 percent and 14.9 percent, respectively (figure 8). However, even these still-low percentages have shown remarkable change over time: 25 years ago, when females were only 19.5 percent of all doctorate recipients, they constituted 7.7 percent and 1.0 percent in the physical sciences and engineering, respectively. Similar long-term trends are discernible in other broad fields as well: in the life sciences from 18.3 percent in 1974 to 44.7 percent in 1999; 23.5 percent to 54.5 percent in the social sciences over that same period; and from 30.5 percent in the humanities in 1974 to the current 48.9 percent. (See table 7.) In all seven of the broad fields, the number of doctorates awarded to men was lower in 1999 than in 1998. Females experienced declines in five of the seven broad fields; only in engineering and education were the numbers of doctorates granted to women in 1999 higher than in 1998.  1969,1979,1989,1999 All For U.S. citizens as a whole, 47.9 percent of all doctorates awarded in 1999 went to women, up from 47.7 percent in 1998 and continuing a long-term trend of U.S. women approaching parity with their male counterparts. For example, in 1979, among U.S. citizens, women earned only 31.0 percent of all doctorates. In fact, the number of male U.S. citizens earning doctorates was more than 3,000 higher in 1979 than it was in 1999, and in the 1990s while the number of doctorates going to U.S. males is relatively level, the number earned by U.S. women has increased every year except 1999. (See appendix tables A-4 and B-2.) Among permanent residents earning doctorates in 1999, only 40.2 percent were female, and among those doctorate recipients holding temporary visas, only 26.8 percent were female (appendix table A-4). Women holding temporary visas are more concentrated in the S&E fields of study than women who are U.S. citizens. While women with temporary visas represented 13.9 percent of all female doctorates in 1999, they earned 28.4 percent of the doctorates earned by females in the physical sciences, 32.7 percent of the female-earned doctorates in engineering, and 20.9 percent of the doctorates earned by females in the life sciences (appendix table A-3c)."}, {"section_title": "Doctorates by Race/Ethnicity", "text": "While the total number of doctorates fell between 1998 and 1999, for U.S. citizens the aggregate number of minority doctorate recipients increased by 5.1 percent. Within race/ethnic categories, Asians and American Indians showed the largest percentage gains, 12.8 percent and 15.9 percent, respectively; the corresponding figure for blacks was 7.6 percent. Hispanics were the only minority group to register a decrease in the number of doctorates in 1999, falling by 7.4 percent. By comparison, the number of white doctorate recipients fell by 1.8 percent. (See   appendix table B-22.) A total of 4,248 doctorates were awarded to members of U.S. racial/ethnic groupings in 1999. This figure is, as noted above, 5.1 percent higher than one year earlier; it is also 38.0 percent higher than the total five years earlier (1994) and nearly double (99.3 percent higher) the number for 1989. With regard to broad field of study, U.S. minorities received more doctorates in 1999 than in 1998 in five of the seven groupings; in only one area education did the number fall; for engineering the 1998 and 1999 totals were identical (see table 8 and Summary Report 1998   table 8). If 1994 is compared with 1999, two years in which the total numbers of doctorates awarded were virtually the same, minorities registered sizable gains in all seven broad fields, ranging from a 22.6 percent increase in the physical sciences to a 56.4 percent increase in the social sciences. Over that same period, the number of doctorates awarded to whites fell by 3.7"}, {"section_title": "percent.

Hispanics and American Indians registered gains in some fields but declines in others (see table 8). With regard to the 24 subfields listed in table 9, Asians showed absolute increases in 16 of those disciplines, declines in 3, and no change in 5. Blacks showed absolute increases in 15, declines in 7, and no change in 2. By contrast, Hispanics experienced increases in only 10 and decreases in 13, and American Indians gained in 12, declined in 10, and were stable in 2. The number of white graduates declined in 18 of the 24 subfields and increased in only 6. For a breakdown of minority representation by sex, see the previous section.   With regard to broad field of study, of the doctoral population with known citizenship status, U.S. citizens earned more than 80 percent of the doctorates awarded in the social sciences, humanities, and education (81.3 percent, 81.8 percent, and 88.6 percent, respectively) in 1999.  Although similar in general, parental education backgrounds of male and female 1999 doctorate recipients differed with respect to mothers' education. Female doctorate recipients were more likely than their male counterparts to have a mother who attended college or who earned an advanced degree. There is considerable variation in parental education attainment by race/ethnicity, citizenship status, and broad field of study. Compared with other racial/ethnic categories, Asian American doctorate recipients were more likely to come from families in which both the father and mother had advanced degrees; black, Hispanic and American Indian recipients' parents were the least likely to have gone beyond high school. U.S. citizen doctorate recipients were more likely than those with either permanent residency status or holding temporary visas to have parents with advanced degrees (and less likely than these two groups to have parents whose formal education did not extend beyond the high school level). The distributions of parental education by the broad fields in table 15 reflect in part the different sex, race/ethnic, and citizenship compositions of the fields. Doctorate recipients in the humanities displayed the highest percentages of both fathers (43.2 percent) and mothers (25.4 percent) with advanced degrees. Education doctorate recipients had the lowest incidence of advanced degrees by fathers or mothers, 21.1 percent and 11.7 percent, respectively. These two broad fields are also the least and most represented, respectively, with regard to the fraction of parents whose formal education stopped at high school or before."}, {"section_title": "Time to Degree", "text": "The amount of time needed to complete a doctorate is a key concern not only for those pursuing the degree but also for the faculties and administrations of the degree-granting institutions, as well as national public agencies and private organizations that support doctoral study. Time to degree is likely to be affected by individual preferences and economic constraints, as well as by the labor markets and cultures of the academic disciplines and institution-specific program characteristics. The SED indexes time to degree in three ways: (1) the total time elapsed from completion of the baccalaureate to completion of the doctorate, (2) the total time elapsed while actually registered in graduate school to completion of the doctorate, and (3) the simple age of the doctorate recipients. In this section, the 1999 data and the historical trends for each of these measures is reviewed for the whole population of doctorate recipients and separately by broad field and the background variables of sex, race/ethnicity, and citizenship. The median total time span from baccalaureate to doctorate for the 1999 doctorate recipients was 10.4 years (table 16), the same as in 1998. The total time span was shortest in the broad area of physical sciences and mathematics (8.0 years) and longest in education (19.9 years) and professional/other fields (14.0 years). These latter two broad fields include large numbers of individuals who have worked full time before starting their graduate degree programs and even continue to work full time while earning their doctorates. The historical data in table 16 show that the 1999 median total time to degree was about 5 months shorter than in 1994. The longer term trend has been one of increases in length from 1974 to 1994 (see figure 13 and table 16). The broad fields of engineering; physical, life, and social sciences; and humanities follow this overall pattern toward shorter times, but median time to degree for education and the professional/other fields increased from 1994 to 1999. The median duration of being registered in graduate school was 7.3 years for the 1999 doctorates (table 16), also identical to the number for 1998. Registered time to degree was shortest in engineering (6.6 years) and the physical sciences and mathematics (6.8 years), and longest in the humanities (8.9 years) (table 16). The trend for time registered is one of small but steady increases over the 25-year span from 1974 to 1999 (see figure 13 and table 16) for all seven broad fields, with some flattening in the past five years in all broad fields except the professional/other fields category.  The median time to degree indices vary somewhat by sex, citizenship, and race/ethnicity, but these differences are mainly reflections of the broad field differences reviewed above (table   17). Across the whole population of new doctorate recipients, females had longer total and registered times to degree than did males, but the sex differences disappear or reverse when males and females are compared within humanities and the physical, life, social sciences. Similar patterns hold for comparisons of U.S. and non-U.S. citizens, and of the U.S. racial/ethnic groups (see table 17). The third measure of time to degree compiled in the SED is age at doctorate. "}, {"section_title": "32", "text": "Financial Resources in Support of Doctorate Recipients,"}, {"section_title": "Including Indebtedness", "text": "The SED asks two questions that, taken together, provide information on the financial sources of support utilized by the new doctorate recipients (for the exact formats and wordings, see the copy of the questionnaire in Appendix D). The first question is a checklist of 13 different potential sources of support, such as fellowships and scholarships, dissertation grants, teaching and research assistantships, and various personal arrangements. The second question asks which of the checked sources was the primary source of support and which was the second most important. For purposes here, respondents are grouped in terms of their primary sources of support. The 13 sources are combined into the seven categories that form the rows in table 19. Well over half-60.9 percent of the 1999 doctorate recipients received the majority of their support for doctoral study from program-or institution-based sources, such as teaching assistantships, research assistantships/traineeships, and fellowships/dissertation grants.'' Just under a third (32.6 percent) of all 1999 doctorate recipients reported that their own resources (which include funds from loans, one's spouse, savings, and non-academic employment) were the primary sources they used to finance their doctoral studies. Foreign government, employer contributions, and \"other\" sources accounted for the remaining 6.5 percent of the cases. (See   table 19.) Overall, women were more dependent upon personal resources than were men (41.2 percent versus 26.1 percent). The same was true for U.S. citizens (40.6 percent) compared to foreign citizens on permanent or temporary visas (22.1 percent and 10.2 percent, respectively). However, sources of support vary considerably by field of study. For example, within engineering, a much higher than average percentage of new doctorate recipients reported program-or institution-based programs as primary sources of support (76.4 percent) and a greater percentage of men than women (13.2 percent versus 9.2 percent) reported their own resources as the primary source of support. In the physical sciences, 85.6 percent of research doctorate recipients in 1999 listed teaching/research assistantships or fellowships as their principal form of support, as did 76.6 percent of those in the life sciences. By contrast, only 57.5 percent of doctorate recipients in the 11 The Federal government and other governments can be the original source of these funds. humanities, 52.0 percent of those in the social sciences, and 20.9 percent of those in education reported these categories as the primary sources of financial support for their doctoral program. In light of these different patterns in the broad fields of study, aggregate comparisons of graduate sources of financial support among demographic groups should be interpreted cautiously. Non-U.S. citizens tend to be more concentrated in fields where the majority of doctoral students receive institution-and/or program-based support. Reflecting this concentration, non-U.S. citizens reported lower percentages of reliance on their own resources than did U.S. citizens. This pattern was consistent across all of the broad fields of study. With regard to race/ethnicity, black doctorate recipients indicated the greatest reliance on their own resources to finance their doctoral program (48.6 percent), followed by American Indians (44.4 percent), whites (41.0 percent), Hispanics (40.7 percent), and Asians (22.7 percent). Within most of the broad fields of study, the race/ethnicity differences in reliance on own resources diminish. Some large race/ethnic differences within fields are found, however, in terms of use of the different types of program-and institution-based supports. In the physical sciences and engineering, Asians and whites were more likely than blacks and Hispanics to rely on teaching and research assistantships and less likely to have fellowships or dissertation grants as their primary source of support. The SED also asks the new doctorate recipients to indicate the amount of money they owe that is directly tied to their undergraduate or graduate education. This is defined as debt related to tuition and fees, living expenses and supplies, and transportation to and from school. The response categories begin with \"none\" and proceed upward in $5,000 increments, with \"$30,001 or more\" at the top. A total of 37,188 (90.4 percent) 1999 graduates responded to the question. Half (49.9 percent) of the 1999 respondents reported having no education-related debt, and another 24.0 percent reported cumulative debt of $15,000 or less (table 20). However, a distinct bulge at the high end of the debt distribution is also evident, with 13.3 percent of all new doctorate recipients reporting debt over $30,000. Looking at the debt distributions within each of the seven broad fields, graduates in the physical sciences, engineering, education, and the life sciences are most likely to complete the doctorate with no education-related debt (table 20). Social scientists and humanities graduates are much less likely to have' no debt. Debt levels in excess of $30,000 or more are most common among social scientists (24.3 percent), graduates in the professional/other fields areas ( I 7.6 percent), and the humanities (15.5 percent). The pattern of debt levels for the main demographic groups are shown in table 21. Particularly noteworthy in these tabulations is the much higher probability of blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians to incur high leVels of education-related debt. Over a quarter (26.5 percent) of black doctorate recipients, 23.8 percent of American Indians, and 20.4 percent of Hispanics owed more than $30,000; these figures compare to 12.0 percent of Asians and 14.9 percent of whites owing that much. At the other extreme, Asians and whites are much more likely than the other groups to have no education-related debt upon completion of the doctorate."}, {"section_title": "Postgraduate Plans, Employment,' and Location", "text": "The SED questionnaire includes a number of questions about the graduates' immediate plans for work or further study.I2 The responses provide a useful overview of the numbers planning to enter academic positions, government and industry, and postdoctoral programs of research and further study. Information is also collected on the main types of work activities research, teaching, administration, and professional services to individuals --that the graduates anticipate in their new positions. Three aspects of postgraduation plans are examined in this report. The first is whether the new doctorate recipient has a definite or indefinite commitment for employment or a postdoctoral position. These data are examined by broad field of study, sex, citizenship, and race/ethnicity (tables 22 and 23). The second aspect is the distribution of graduates with definite commitments for career employment versus for postdoctorate research and study programs. This distribution is also examined separately by broad field of study, sex, citizenship, and race/ethnicity (tables 24 and 25), as well as by visa status and anticipated location (foreign versus U.S.) for non-U.S. citizens (tables 26 and 27).

How willingly families will migrate from one location to another, and how easily workers are able to respond to market signals and make the transition from one opportunity to another or to turn a disappointment in issues are also of particular current interest to individual states across the country, which has implications for allocations for higher education and other public expenditures, as well as other legislative initiatives. Governors, state legislators and others express concern over the loss of their well-educated citizens to other states, or whether they are providing substantial subventions to out-of-state students who then return home or move elsewhere after they complete their undergraduate or graduate/professional studies. Support for higher education is occasionally couched in such terms and calculations. This special section focuses on the extent and pattern of interstate migration of doctorate recipients from United States universities from birth through initial postgraduate employment.' 3 This is arguably one of the highest skilled segments of the American labor force, and one for which personal and professional decisions to migrate is of great importance."}, {"section_title": "The Data Set", "text": "The Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) questionnaire (see Appendix D) asks for state of residence information at five points in a respondent's personal event history: (I) state of birth; (2) state in which they received their high school diploma; (3) state where they first enrolled in college; (4) state where they earned their doctorate; and (5) state in which they accepted their initial postdoctorate employment. The data drawn on here are from the 1999 SED.14 From the universe of 41,140 doctorate recipients in 1999, we confined our investigation to native-born U.S. citizens who also provided information on where they were born, where they completed high school, where they started college, and where they planned to work after receipt of the doctorate. This yielded a subset of 23,153 individuals, or 89.6 percent of the 25,843 known native-born U.S. citizens earning doctorates in 1999. We used this data set to examine the general pattern and overall level of migration among the new doctorate population, and the extent to which mobility varies by sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, parental education, employment sector, and academic discipline."}, {"section_title": "From Birth to College", "text": "Overall, 13.4 percent of doctorate recipients in our study were born, graduated from high school, entered college, received a doctorate, and planned to work all in the same state. By contrast, 8.7 percent of that same population noted an entirely different state for each of these five chronological markers. (See table 2-1, which also includes these patterns by sex and other characteristics.) About a third (34.0 percent) of these doctorate recipients were graduated from high school in a state other than the one in which they were born15 (see table 2-2). Almost the same proportion (36.1 percent) of new recipients first entered college in a state other than the one in which they earned a high school diploma, a figure that is higher than the percentage for college freshmen as a whole. percentages imply that there is no single time period in which \"brain drain\" or \"brain gain\" occurs, but rather that migration appears to be more of a continuous process."}, {"section_title": "Migration and Sex", "text": "With respect to demographic characteristics, male and female doctorate recipients exhibited similar migration patterns between birth and graduation from high school, as one would expect (that is, family decision-making with regard to moving should be largely independent of the sex of their child). The same pattern is observed for in-state versus out-ofstate college matriculations by sex: 36.5 percent of males and 35.6 percent of females went to college in a state other than the one in which they received their high school diploma. Larger differences by sex begin to appear between college and doctorate institution choices and between doctorate institution location and initial employment: 50.9 percent of females but 59.2 percent of males intended to work in a state different from the one in which they earned the doctorate. (See "}, {"section_title": "Migration and Marital Status", "text": "More than three in five (63.9 percent) of doctorate recipients in our subset were married or living in a marriage-like relationship at the time they received the degree; another 7.9 percent were either separated, widowed, or divorced; 28.2 percent had never been married. The \"never married\" group exhibited a greater tendency to enroll in an out-of-state college (39.7 percent versus 35.0 percent for the married/marriage-like group, and 31.5 percent for the separated/widowed/divorced category), 71.6 percent earned a doctorate in a state other than the one in which they went as an undergraduate (versus 68.0 percent and 64.4 percent, respectively, for other two groups), and 64.3 percent intended to work in a state different from the one in which they earned their terminal degree (versus 51.8 percent and 50.1 percent). (See table 2-2.) Overall, those who had never been married exhibited the lowest tendencies to stay in the state of birth or in which they had gone to high school or college. These differences may reflect a tendency for those without spouses to be less constrained by personal obligations that could affect their willingness to migrate (that is, an employed spouse, children, or other aspects of joint decision-making within the family could lead to more geographic stability); the data are consistent with this hypothesis (see table 2-3)."}, {"section_title": "Migration and Family Background", "text": "The SED provides information on the level of educational attainment of doctorate recipients' parents. For present purposes, we segmented recipients into two groups: those from families in which neither parent had received a baccalaureate degree (that is, the highest level of educational attainment in the family included those with less than a high school diploma, a high school diploma, or some college) and those whose parents had earned a bachelor's degree or higher (36.2 percent and 63.8 percent, respectively). The percentage of doctorate recipients from families with the higher educational backgrounds who graduated from high school in a state other than the one in which they were born than was almost twice the percentage for recipients whose parents' educational attainments were more modest (41.0 percent versus 21.8 percent, respectively). This pattern occurs at the other educational markers in these doctorate recipients' lives: students from more highly educated family backgrounds were more likely to have attended an out-of-state college (42.9 percent versus 24.1 percent), enrolled in college and earned doctorate degrees in different states (72.6 percent versus 62.0 percent), and planned to work in a state other than the one in which they earned the doctorate (58.6 percent versus 49.1 percent).

Among the S&E doctorate recipients, students who earned doctorates in the agricultural sciences and chemistry were the least likely to leave their state of birth by high school and college matriculation (29.9 percent and 30.2 percent, respectively). A similar percentage (28.5 percent) of the doctorate recipients in the heterogeneous \"other\" field category, two-thirds of which represents doctorate recipients in education,I9 left their state of birth by high school and college matriculation. Those in the \"other\" fields also were the most likely to enter college and graduate school within the same state. The third column of numbers in table 2-4 shows the percentages of the 1999 doctorate recipients who earned their doctorates in different states than where they first entered college. These percentages are generally much higher than the rates of out-migration between high school and college entry. The graduates from physics/astronomy and the humanities were the most likely to change states between where they entered college and where they completed the doctorate (77.5 percent and 76.1 percent, respectively). The \"other\" category, dominated by education doctorate recipients, showed the lowest migration levels between these two points (60.6 percent moved), followed by engineering students (67.2 percent), and psychology (68.7 percent). With respect to interstate moves between earning the doctorate and place of employment after graduate school, the last column in table 2-4 shows that students whose degrees were in chemistry, physics/astronomy, and social science were the most likely to migrate.

Before they reached their mid-thirties (as noted in an earlier section, the median age at time-to-degree for this cohort was slightly less than 34 years), many of these scholars had moved across state boundaries to attend college, select the doctoral program of their choice, and accept employment. Earlier in life, a third of them graduated from high school in a state other than the one in which they had been born, and more than a third went out of their home state for undergraduate studies. Fewer than one in seven doctorate recipients lived, was educated, and planned to be employed professionally in the same state. Upon completion of their doctorate, fewer than one-third planned to return to a state in which they had been born, went to high school, or attended college.

The \"other\" field categoriese.g., \"chemistry, other\"include individuals whose specified doctoral discipline was not among the specialty fields listed.  In Table A-3 the postgraduation plans of doctorate recipients are grouped as follows: \"Postdoctoral Study Plans\" (fellowship, research internship, traineeship, other), \"Planned Employment after Doctorate\" (educational institution, industry, etc.), and \"Postdoctoral Plans Unknown.\" These categories include recipients who were still negotiating or seeking positions at the time of survey completion, as well as those whose plans were definite. The sum of these lines equals 100 percent for each column, with allowance for rounding: for example, 28.0 percent of all psychology doctorate recipients had postdoctoral study plans, 54.2 percent planned to be employed, and 17.8 percent did not report their post-graduation plans, totaling 100 percent. The postdoctoral study row is further subdivided by type of study or appointment (fellowships, research associateships, traineeships, and other study). The percentages in these subdivisions sum to the percent of respondents in the given column who reported plans for postdoctoral study. The employment row is similarly subdivided by type of employer. The percentages for these rows add to percentage of respondents in the given column who planned employment. The category for educational institutions includes elementary and secondary schools as well as colleges and universities, and the category for government includes military service. The four lines of data beginning with \"Definite Postdoctoral Study\" distinguish between individuals who had definite postgraduation plans at the time of survey completion (item Bl: \"Am returning to, or continuing in, predoctoral employment\" or \"Have signed contract or made definite commitment\") and those who were still seeking employment or postdoctoral study (item B 1: \"Am negotiating with one or more specific organizations,\" \"Am seeking position but have no specific prospects,\" or \"Other\"). These four lines, when added to the prior line, \"Postdoctoral Plans Unknown,\" total 100 percent with allowance for rounding. The two lines \"Definite Postdoctoral Study\" and \"Seeking Postdoctoral Study\" add to give the percentage for \"Postdoctoral Study Plans\"; the two lines \"Definite Employment\" and \"Seeking Employment\" add to give the percentage for \"Planned Employment After Doctorate.\" Percentages showing the distribution of doctorate recipients by postdoctoral work activity and region of employment are based only on the number of recipients who had definite employment commitments at the time they completed the questionnaire. These percentages exclude recipients who planned postdoctoral study (as described above) and recipients who were still seeking employment at the time they completed the questionnaire.

The rate for 1999 may increase slightly in the next year if additional questionnaires are received after survey closure. Self-report rates for 1980-99 are determined from the \"source of response\" indicator in the doctorate records. Because this indicator was not coded prior to 1980, survey forms for 1965-79 are assumed to be self-reported if \"month signed\" or \"marital status\" is present. \"Marital status\" is not available from sources other than the doctorate recipient. As shown in the table above, 91.7 percent of 1999 U.S. research doctorate recipients completed survey forms. This percentage is what has been referred to as the \"self-report\" rate. For the remaining doctorate recipients, \"skeleton\" records were created using basic information obtained from doctorate-granting institutions or from commencement programs. This skeleton information includes Ph.D. institution, Ph.D. field, Ph.D. year, and sex of Ph.D. recipient. It should be noted that the sex variable was not always available, even for survey respondents. Every effort was made to obtain this information for as many respondents as possible, but for a small percentage, this could not be done with confidence. Thus, you will notice that there are missing data for many of the tabulations involving sex in this year's report. Prior to 1997, whenever sex was missing, the data were assigned to \"male.\" In 1997, it was decided to 107 133 discontinue this practice. The tabulations involving sex for 1997 through 1999 exclude missing cases except where noted otherwise. Wherever possible this report includes data from all Ph.D. records whether complete or skeletal; thus the reported total number of Ph.D. recipients for 1999 (41,140) includes both respondents and non-respondents.
