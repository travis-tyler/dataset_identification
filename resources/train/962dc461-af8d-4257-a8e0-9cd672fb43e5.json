[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Organic farming in the United States has been rapidly growing since the 1990s. The overall certified organic acreage increased 45% from 1992 to 1997 and 63% from 1997 to 2003, to represent 0.24% of total farm acreage in 2003 (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, 2006a; USDA-ERS). While the organic acreage for vegetables exceeded 3.9% of total acreage, the percentage of the top U.S. field crops grown under certified organic farming systems remained minimal: 0.13% for corn and 0.17% for soybeans in 2003. Yet, the number of certified organic milk cows increased over thirty-fold from 1992 to 2003 with the retail sales growth of organic dairy products leading other organic foods (USDA-ERS, 2006a;Dimitri and Greene, 2002). In 2005, the retail sales growth rate of bread and grains exceeded the overall growth rate of organic foods (Organic Trade Association, 2006). These changes are likely to encourage organic grain production. Risk management tools and strategies such as crop insurance and hedging with futures and options contracts are more developed and readily available for the conventional grain sector than for other conventional agricultural sectors. But, organic grain farming is distinct from its conventional counterpart. For example, conventional farmers can deposit a whole harvest at a local grain elevator, but most organic farmers store their grains on site bearing the risk of postharvest losses until shipment. Most conventional grains are homogeneous and handled in bulk, but buyers in the organic market vary in needs, both in terms of quantity and quality, implying price risk associated with market saturation. The identity of an organic crop is threatened throughout the production process via chemical drifts from neighboring conventional farms and the distribution process via possible commingling of conventionally produced varieties. Most often, its sales are handled through individual contracts subject to default risk. The uniqueness of organic grain farming suggests that risk sources and risk management needs for organic grain farmers differ from those for conventional counterparts. It is not even clear whether risk management tools and strategies that are applicable to conventional grains are effective for organic grains. The federal crop insurance program was offered for organic crops in 2003, but our discussion with organic farmers suggested additional modifications were needed to ensure effective coverage for organic grain farmers. Premia for organic foods, particularly at the retail level, are easily noted by consumers, but the prices received by producers are seldom documented. Several studies that have reported that organic cropping systems are at least as profitable as conventional cropping systems assume arbitrary organic price premia (e.g., Mahoney et al., 2001; see Greene and Kremen, 2003, for reviews of other studies). Typically, the potential difficulty of marketing certain crops used in the cropping rotation is not considered. Thus, despite the rapid expansion of organic farming, the impact of adopting organic farming on farm income is not clear. In order to better understand risk and profitability issues faced by organic grain farmers, a survey was administered to organic grain producers nationwide in November and December of 2005. A mailing list was constructed, with a goal of reaching all US organic grain producers, through contacting USDA accredited certifying agents with their respective membership directories managed by the National Organic Program and asking the agents to identify those who raised grains (including soybeans). In total, 3,143 surveys were mailed out and those who had not responded after a month received another copy of the survey. As of June 30, 2006, 1,349 (42.9%) had replied. This report summarizes the findings from the survey responses. In the next section, the administration of the survey is detailed. Then, the characteristics of the respondents are summarized by demographics, farming experiences, resource needs, and approaches to farming. Their farming operations are characterized by size, the degree of diversification, and household income levels. After describing the marketing and pricing methods the respondents have identified, risk issues are discussed by the perceived differences in risks of conventional and organic farming, their opinions towards the currently available crop insurance policies, and the major risk concerns they identified."}, {"section_title": "The Survey Instrument and the Mailing List", "text": "Given our lack of knowledge on organic grain farming, six listening sessions were conducted in different parts of the central U.S. in the spring of 2004. The sessions were held in Minnesota, Montana, Ohio, and Wisconsin, and two locations in Kansas, involving a total of 53 participants. The findings from the listening sessions are summarized in Peterson, Kastens, and Ross (2006). The survey instrument was developed in the summer of 2004, incorporating the findings from the listening sessions to identify the characteristics of organic grain farmers in the U.S., and their risk issues and risk management needs. The instrument was submitted for an approval from the Office of Managerial Budget in accordance to the Paperwork Reduction Act in November 2004, and the approval was obtained in September 2005. The final version of the survey instrument is included in the Appendix of this report. The National Organic Program (NOP) has made the mailing directory of all organic certified operations in the U.S. publicly available for research purposes since the fall of 2005. The list would have included not only all crop and livestock producers but also any handling operations. However, the document only included names and mailing addresses of operations by certifying agents and did not contain any identifier for operational types. Thus, 58 USDA domestic accredited certifying agents listed on the NOP web page of the Agricultural Marketing Service as of August 2005 were contacted by e-mail and phone with a request to identify their members from the NOP directory who raised grains, soybeans, and forage. After repeated contacts, 48 certifying agents responded in the end. Some agents sent us their complete member directories with crops listed for us to identify on our own. Other agents responded to our request literally by identifying grain growers from the NOP directory. Of the 3,413 surveys mailed, 11 were returned due to invalid addresses. To keep track of the responses received, the addresses were identified by numbers on the pre-paid, self-addressed return envelopes. Once the reply was received, the survey was removed from the envelope, disassociating it from the identifying number. A month later, another copy of the same survey was mailed to 1,784 addresses from whom the survey was not yet received. The first and second mailings were distinguished by the color of the survey. The question at the beginning of the survey was intended to screen the respondents so that only those with experience in raising grains (including soybeans) on certified organic acreage were included in our analysis. Accordingly, 1,134 of the responses received were usable according to this question: 779 from the first mailing and 355 from the second mailing. In the report below, descriptive statistics such as means and standard deviations are reported for those with valid responses. The numbers of no responses for each question are reported in the Appendix."}, {"section_title": "Profiles of the Respondents", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Demographics", "text": "The surveys were returned from 35 states. Figure 1 summarizes the locations according to 10 USDA regions. As expected, largest numbers of responses came from the major grain producing regions in the Lake States (Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin) and the Midwest (Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and Ohio). A small number of respondents farmed in the Appalachian, Southeast, and Delta States regions (North Carolina, Tennessee, Florida, Arkansas). The survey requested that \"the primary operator of the farm\" answer the questions. The majority of the survey (95.9%) was completed by a male and only 4.1% was completed by a female. At the listening sessions, many farm operators showed up as husband and wife pairs. Thus, the proportion of females who responded to our survey was lower than our expectations. The proportion of female respondents is smaller than the proportion of farms with female principal operators according to the 2002 Agricultural Census of 11.2% (USDA-National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2002; USDA-NASS). The age distribution of the respondents is depicted in figure 2, with a median respondent in the 50s. Our sample seems younger than the 2002 Agricultural Census population with 43.0% (vs 36.0%) under 50 and 10.1% (vs 16.9%) over 70 (USDA-NASS, 2002). Figure 3 reports the level of education completed by the respondents. One-third of the respondents had completed at least a 4-year college degree and 10.9% of the respondents had attended graduate school. According to the 2003 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS), approximately 15% of farm operators had earned a college degree (USDA-ERS, 2006b). Thus, organic grain farmers as a group seem to be more educated than the overall farm population."}, {"section_title": "Farming Experience", "text": "Eighty-percent of the respondents indicated that farm or ranch work was their primary occupation. This proportion is considerably higher than 57.5% from the 2002 Agricultural Census (USDA-NASS, 2002). The percentage of their work time allocated to farm or ranch work ranged from 0 to 100%, with an average of 79.7%. The person who responded 0% explained that he worked on his farm operation during weekday evenings and weekends only. The average respondent had farmed 26.6 years since turning 18 years old, with a standard deviation of 12.2 years. The experience among respondents varied widely ranging from a veteran of 69 years to a novice of just starting out (0 years). The number of years the respondents had farmed organically varied widely as well, with mean of 10.6 years and standard deviation of 7.6 years. The minimum was 0 years, as expected, while the most experienced person had farmed organically for 63 years. Most of the respondents had raised grains during this time; the response distribution for the number of years the respondents had raised organic grains was nearly identical to the number of years they had farmed organically. The average year the respondent's farm became certified organic was 1997 with standard deviation of 5.6 years. The distribution is skewed, as can be seen in figure 4. There were quite a few farms certified prior to the final announcement of the USDA organic standards in 2000. The largest number of respondents (43.3%) were certified between 1996 and 2000, while 28.4% were certified after 2001. Farming experience prior to growing organic grains varied, but many respondents (73.3%) had raised grains with conventional farming practices. Another 9.8% farmed, was raised, or worked on a conventional farming operation. Only 9.1% of the respondents farmed or was raised on an organic farm, in addition to 3.7% who had experiences in semi-organic farming methods. A small fraction (3.8%) of the respondents did not have any prior farming experience. Regarding their future farming plans, 82% of the respondents indicated that they intended to farm organically 100% eventually. Sixteen percent answered that they intended to maintain both conventional and organic acreage, and were equally divided about whether they intended to have more or less than 50% of the land as certified organic. The remaining 1.8% indicated that they intend on farming conventionally 100% in the future. There were 179 (15.8% of 1,134) nonresponses to this question. It could be that the respondents had not considered their future plans or that their future plans were to withdraw from farming completely, which was not provided as an option. Table 1 summarizes the responses regarding four \"resource needs\" statements. A majority (54.6%) of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed that more information on organic production practices would help their organic grain farming operation, and 53.3% for more marketing information. The role of public and private sectors is quite clearly implied here."}, {"section_title": "Resource Needs", "text": "While 37.1% of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed that more availability of risk management strategies would be helpful, a greater 37.9% of the respondents were neutral about this statement. At this point, it seems that a greater concern among organic grain farmers is to raise the overall performance of their farm operations rather than to stabilize its variability at some cost. A need for additional storage capacity was mentioned in listening sessions (Peterson, Kastens, and Ross, 2006). But, this need was not shared widely across the nation, with 41.3% of the respondents disagreeing or strongly disagreeing with the statement. It is of interest to see whether the need for storage is regional or arises due to some other characteristics of farm operations. Table 2 summarizes the responses to the approaches to farming, i.e., objectives or value statements. More than two out of every three respondents (68.2%) agreed or strongly agreed that their objectives were to maximize profitability. Less than 10% (9.7%) disagreed or strongly disagreed with this statement."}, {"section_title": "Approach to Farming", "text": "An overwhelming majority (90.8%) regarded environmental stewardship as an important aspect of their farming practices. Only 1.6% of the respondents disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement. Similarly, but not as overwhelmingly, the majority (77.7%) agreed or strongly agreed that they were farming to pass the farm to the next generation, with 7.8% disagreeing or strongly disagreeing with the statement. To the contrary, over half (55.1%) disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement that they only needed to earn enough income to cover family living expenses comfortably. At the same time, 23.3% agreed or strongly agreed with the statement. Lastly, 67.5% of the respondents agreed or strongly disagreed with the statement that organic was their lifestyle, while 12.0% disagreed or strongly disagreed. It is of interest to analyze the characteristics of those who do not regard organic as lifestyle. A simple correlation between the responses to this lifestyle statement and those to the profit-maximizing statement yielded -0.13."}, {"section_title": "Farm Characteristics", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Size and Diversification", "text": "The total acreage farmed varied from 2 to 25,000 acres. The question did not distinguish crop farming from grazing, and for the respondents who distinguished the two operations, the acreage for crop farming was used. The average was 698 acres with a standard deviation of 1,433.7 acres. For reference, the number of acres operated per farm averaged 437 for all farms in the 2003 ARMS survey (Hoppe and Banker, 2006). Our sample average lies between the average acreages of family farms with less than $10,000 in sales (463 acres) and between $10,000 and $250,000 (1,165 acres). As figure 5 illustrates, the distribution is extremely skewed, with nearly half (46.5%) of the respondents having farms smaller than 500 acres. The median respondent farmed 280 acres. The percentage of total acreage that is certified organic ranged from 0 (likely undergoing transition) and 100. Figure 6 depicts that 75% of the respondents had more than 90% of their acreage certified as organic, and the remaining 25% of the sample appears to be more or less uniformly distributed across the percentages less than 90. Operations were expected to be diverse. Table 3 lists various grains, livestock, and other crops that the respondents had identified as grown within the last three years, along with other farmrelated enterprises they had managed. In addition to grains that have substantial market in the conventional sector, such as corn and soybeans, many minor grains were incorporated into the rotation by these organic grain farmers. The average number of grains raised by a respondent was 3.0 with standard deviation of 1.4 and the maximum of 10. The distribution of responses is illustrated in figure 7. Those with 0 grains indicated that they had stopped growing grains over the most recent years. There were 705 respondents (62.2% of 1,134) who were engaged in some livestock enterprise and 452 respondents (39.9% of 1,134) who raised some other crop besides grains. Counting the livestock and other crop enterprises as listed in table 3, together with the grain enterprises, the number of \"production\" enterprises operated by the respondents averaged 5.8, with a standard deviation of 2.4 and a maximum of 17. The distribution is depicted in figure 8. These numbers of production enterprises are can more or less be compared to the average number of commodities reported from the 2003 ARMS of 1.9 for all farms (Hoppe and Banker, 2006). 1 Of the various farm types distinguished in the ARMS report, the most diversified group consists of family farms with $10,000 to $250,000 in sales, averaging 3.6 commodities. In addition to the production enterprises, 810 respondents (71.4% of 1,134) managed some farmrelated enterprises, such as (custom) haying or grazing, value-added activities (e.g., grain processing), and other services (e.g., machinery repair). The average number of such \"nonproduction\" enterprises was 1.4, with a standard deviation of 0.5 and a maximum of 3."}, {"section_title": "Household Income", "text": "The respondents were asked to identify a range of annual household income (net farm income plus off-farm wages before taxes) over the last 3 years. Figure 9 summarizes the responses. Only 1.7% chose the description \"net loss.\" This percentage is smaller than the percentage of farms with negative total household income of 5.6% in the 2003 ARMS (Hoppe and Banker, 2006). Nearly half (48.7%) indicated a range between $20,000 and $60,000, and 12.4% indicated income greater than $120,000. The median respondent chose a range between $40,000 and $60,000. For reference, the mean household income for all family farms was $68,515 according to the 2003 ARMS. The means for family farms with less than $10,000 in sales and with sales between $10,000 and $250,000 were $49,807 and $60,722, respectively. The percentage of this household income that was obtained from off-farm sources ranged from -5 to 100%, with mean of 34.4% and a similar standard deviation of 34.2%. The average is lower than the all-farm average of 88.8% at the 1% level and lies between the averages for large and very large farms of 39.1% and 19.7%, respectively (Hoppe and Banker, 2006). 2 The percentage of net farm income attributed to organic farming ranged similarly from -10 to 100%, with a mean of 63.8% and a standard deviation of 36.3%. Using these percentages, the percentage of annual household income attributed to organic farming (which could range from 0 to 100%) can be computed; this distribution has a mean of 45.0% and a standard deviation of 36.8%. Figure 10 depicts a U-shaped distribution with 27.4 and 20.4% of the respondents obtaining less than 10% and more than 90% of their income from organic farming, respectively."}, {"section_title": "Marketing of Organic Grains", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Marketing Methods", "text": "The outlets used by the respondents to market organic grain crops are summarized in table 4. The most popular methods were individually negotiated transactions in some form of contracts or spot sales after harvest. Both contracts and post-harvest spot sales were used by a little over 50% of the respondents. The next most popular marketing outlet was marketing through cooperatives or marketing groups. For these transactions, about one-and-a-half times as many respondents used marketing contracts as spot sales after harvest (18.7% vs 12.3%). Of those who indicated that they used their grains on their farms, most of them indicated that they feed all of their crops to their livestock, thus having no need for alternative outlets. Other marketing methods mentioned involved direct marketing through farmers' markets and self-serve stands and marketing through individual agents or brokers. In addition, there were 6 respondents who explicitly mentioned the use of forward contracts. Table 5 summarizes what the respondents take into consideration when determining the price of their grains. The majority (65.2%) of the respondents referred to the quotes from their marketing representatives, including cooperatives. Also, more than half (54.5%) of the respondents compared notes with fellow farmers to gauge the price level. About one in four respondents (24.3%) took account of their costs of production. The next most common source of price information, used by 22.3% of the respondents, was the quotes available from industry publications or over the Internet."}, {"section_title": "Pricing Methods", "text": "There were 16.6% of the respondents who indicated that they took into account the conventional prices when pricing their organic grains, and 5.6% observed the futures prices at the Chicago Board of Trade. These responses suggest that at least a fraction of organic grain farmers perceive that the conventional and organic markets are linked in some fashion. There were several minor sources of price information. Several respondents (5.5%) indicated that they approached their buyers or brokers to get a feel for the prevailing price. \"Other references\" included past prices or prices of retail organic products. Some respondents explicitly mentioned the concepts of \"supply and demand\" or \"market equilibrium\" as things they took into consideration, while others indicated that they decided on their own price or mark-up levels after consulting with other references. Figure 11 combines the information given in Table 5 with how often the respondents identified each source as their primary price determinant. There were 496 respondents (43.7% of 1,134) who did not indicate their primary determinant, either because they referred to various sources uniformly or because the instructions for this question were unclear. As a primary determinant, the most common were quotes from marketing representatives (37.6% of those who answered this question), followed by other farmers (15.9%) and cost of production (5.4%). Another question related to pricing methods inquired whether the respondent used mark-ups from a reference price to price their grains. Of the 718 respondents (63.3% of 1,134) who answered, 17.1% (123) indicated that they used such mark-ups."}, {"section_title": "Risk Issues", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Perceived Differences in Risks between Conventional and Organic Farming", "text": "Figures 12 and 13 summarize the perceived differences in yields and their variability between conventional and organic grain farming. About 700 respondents (61.7% of 1,134) did not respond to these questions. This low response rate could partly be due to the fact that the questions requested responses if the respondent had grown conventional grains in recent years, and the fact that the question specifically referred to a five-year period. Of those who responded, 60.1% indicated that over the last 5 years, their average organic grain yields were lower than their conventional yields by more than 5%, while 25.1% indicated that their organic yields exceeded their conventional counterparts by more than 5%. The remaining 14.8% indicated that the yields were similar (between \u00b15%). A simple correlation between the response and the number of years the respondent had been farming organically was -0.087 suggesting that it is not necessarily the accumulation of experience or increased soil fertility that is contributing to these differences in perception. Further analysis is necessary. With respect to perceived differences in yield variability, 37.1% perceived that their organic grain yields had fluctuated more from year to year than their conventional yields, while 12.5% perceived that their organic grain yields had less variability. Half of the respondents did not perceive any difference in variability. Similar to the perceived differences in yield levels, the correlation between the response and the number of years of organic farming was only 0.045. There was a greater consensus among the respondents regarding profitability of organic crops relative to that of conventional crops. As shown in figure 14, only 7.6% of the respondents found the organic crops over the last 5 years to be less profitable, on average, than their conventional crops on per-acre basis, while 13.3% found them to be as equally profitable. The remaining 78.7% perceived organic crops to be more profitable, with a wide variability in the perceived differences. Some 14.4% believed that organic crops were more than twice as profitable on per-acre basis."}, {"section_title": "Crop Insurance", "text": "About half (48.4%) of the respondents carried federal crop insurance at the time of the survey and the remaining 51.6% did not. Table 6 summarizes the responses regarding the respondents' thoughts on crop insurance. For each statement, the first row of numbers correspond to all responses, and the second and third rows, respectively, correspond to responses from those with and without crop insurance at the time of the survey. Most respondents who currently did not carry crop insurance (90.8%) and more than half of those who did (53.3%) strongly disagreed with the statement that their financial institutions mandated crop insurance for loans. Yet, a solid minority (9.2%), including a few who did not carry crop insurance, believed that they needed to buy crop insurance for loans. It remains to be investigated whether this is due to differences in regional protocols. The majority (54.3%) strongly agreed with the statement that crop insurance covering at the conventional prices is problematic. Proportionally more respondents who currently carried crop insurance felt this way that those without (60.2% vs 45.0%). On a less obvious note, 54.4% agreed or strongly agreed that some of their farming practices not being considered as approved practices were problematic. The evidence was similar regarding the policy premium. Half of the respondents (49.4%) agreed or strongly agreed with the statement that a higher premium to insure organic crops (relative to conventional crops) was a problem. Proportionally more respondents with crop insurance felt this way than those without (54.0% vs 40.2%). There was little agreement on whether or not crop insurance not covering green manure crops was problematic. The respondents were divided nearly equally across the five choices, with 25.9% strongly disagreeing and 22.7% strongly agreeing. Again, there needs to be further investigation on whether the differences can be explained by differences in regional farming practices. Almost half (45.2%) of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they wanted their insurance agents to have more understanding of organic farming. A slightly greater percentage of respondents without crop insurance felt this way (46.4% vs 44.1%). At the same time, a considerable portion of the respondents (29.0%) were indifferent about this statement. Table 7 summarizes the ranking by the respondents of risk concerns regarding their organic grain operations. The respondents were also asked to identify their two greatest concerns from the list. The first two concerns regarding yield losses can be classified as production risks. Clearly, production risks were important in many farmers' minds. Specifically, 39.3% and 35.9% of the respondents identified yield losses due to weather and to weeds, insects, or deer as strong concerns, respectively. Of 1,061 respondents who identified greatest risk concerns, 37.2% and 41.0%, respectively, identified these two risk concerns as one of their two greatest concerns."}, {"section_title": "Risk Concerns", "text": "Concerns regarding low prices, contracts not being honored, and few buyers can be classified as marketing risks, and the responses showed that many respondents were not overly concerned with these marketing risks. There were 29.1%, 42.6%, and 36.1% of the respondents who identified the three marketing risks as a low concern, respectively. Low prices were considered by 8.6% of the respondents as a primary concern, but only 5% of the respondents identified the other two marketing risks as major concerns. Concerns regarding contamination and commingling were low in many respondents' priorities as well. Over half (56.2%) of the respondents identified concern of on-farm contamination due to prohibited substances as a low concern, while slightly fewer respondents (41.8%) identified concern of on-farm contamination due to genetic contamination as a low concern. Similarly, 43.5% of the respondents indicated that the risk of their crops being mishandled after leaving their farms was of low concern. Some 12.9% of the respondents chose the risk of on-farm contamination from genetically modified materials as one of their main concerns. But, the other contamination risks were selected by only 3% of the respondents as their major concerns. The last three concerns listed in table 5 can be classified together as a risk of the definition of organic being diluted in the marketplace. These risks were of importance to many of our respondents. A majority (57.6%) ranked the concern of large farms entering and swamping the organic market as a 4 or 5 in a scale between 1 and 5, and this concern was one of the major concerns for 30.5% of the respondents. Similarly, half (50.0%) and nearly half (47.0%) of the respondents ranked concerns regarding the USDA standards being too lax or that the organic standards are not being enforced consistently across various industry participants as a 4 or 5, respectively. These concerns were identified by 26.5% and 23.8% of the respondents as one of their greatest concerns.
